position="QB">carson</person> who sustained a concussion against the rams in week 3 sent out the next game against san francisco and then last week played against the jets played well but had to come out of the game at the end of the game and it turns out to be a little bit of a hamstring tweak to all eyes on him tonight as he was somewhat limited in practice as <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> obviously keeping an eye on him all night long as we do in every seahawk game and the pass is caught on a slant by <person player="larry

that time by bruce arians and company up to the 42 yard line varner is looking for that fast one chris mentioned only seven points awesome it s jail but this time he is taken down immediately by <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right sniffing that went out perfectly no gain second 210 yeah it s just so difficult on the outside when youve got these guys trying to get these blocks and then youve got one of the great inside linebackers <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right to come out there and clean things up this is the defense they made some big mistakes in their game last week against the atlanta falcons dont expect a repeat of that here tonight almost all of them in the third quarter second to 10 to take

veteran mic you potty no stranger to the pro bowl missed last week s game with an ankle injury youre just gonna see i think that they thought that was going to be a very quick pass at the outside and then when <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> had to pull it down his offensive lineman assumed it was out and went downfield and obviously too soon well they just changed the callers originally your potty and then terry mccauley said it was offensive pass interference on <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> all right second down and 20 from the 32 yard line outside pick a little about 10 <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> makes the catch and

but short of the first down <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> and he gets tackled in front of the seattle bench but you can see where the marker is <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> looking for the first down he s not going to get it he s almost two yards shy it s fourth down working against <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> youre gonna see them just battle all the way down the field here is theyre both pushing and shoving just a little bit the throw drew <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> back and just left him short i think that his timing of his route just got messed up because of all the contact

montage of some of the cardinals going all the way back to when they were in chicago michael goodwill than some job with this team starting in chicago then they went to st louis coming here they were the phoenix cardinals for a while and they decided to embrace the entire state when they came into this building 11 seasons ago no score siena running its first play now from the 17 yard line and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> starts with 5y under pressure ziggler escape he has to sling it away the pressure put on by kevin mentor the cardinals love to blitz itll be circa down to ten <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> he has just been phenomenal over the last 17 games going back to last year take a look at that last 12 regular season games 29 touchdowns only two interceptions top grading in the lead and even this year despite an ankle injury sustained in week one and knee sprain in week three he s not running as much but he s been very effective throwing the ball crystal michael is the running back then he swings that one to the outside and that is caught there by thugs walsman would have a third down and short as we take a look at the seahawks starters <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> im a whole pack of bad news chris and

up to knock them down and it s a three and out just a brilliant play here theyre going to do the read option and hope that jefferson s going to jump on that is what <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> thought he was going to see but then jefferson who s had a tremendous year so far comes out to make the play he gets his hand underneath you could call it sure close so they didnt have to punch and a booming kick and going up to his own 21 yard line had great coverage as well each team has had the ball once it s a 54yard booth no score dont miss

line just about everywhere and there s no question that bruce arians thinks that he is the most disruptive player along the defensive line in the national football league so keeping up with <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> tonight is going to be job one for arizona s offense second and ten time it s johnson taking it for a gain of a pemberly johnson was picked in the third round played at northern iowa the school that also produced kurt warner was here tonight doing the game on on radio and he has ascendant it was <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> who came in last year and then <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david</person> helped to spell him and then <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david</person> took over toward the end of the year he s the fantasy football darling of the preseason and he s living up to all expectations and you see him flanked out here as a wide receiver he started in college as a wide receiver trained that and plays very much a fight one when he s blanked out thirty seven blitz coming masha s in complete a little high off the fingertips of britain golden covered there by <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> and that s a three and out for arizona <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> was simply sensational a week ago right there a guy that can play the middle of the field they play a lot of man coverage and you have to be able to go sideline to sideline there but a pure intimidator inside when he drops down in coverage like that can pick up even the best of the mantoman on those wide receivers in the second punt a high and short kick fielded at the 40yard line fair catch made there by lock in seattle of the board <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> almost getting better year by year fantastic start to his career fit the season take a look at that otto <person player="jimmy graham" race="white"

21 yards more have been complete since the beginning of last season 16 touchdowns he s just been terrific the third most accurate guy of any pass is only behind tom brady and matthew stafford he wouldnt expect that out of a deep we receivers set to the light he comes over the middle and low at his home there marcus goals and put the pressure on that time itll be putting a lot of pressure on all night long number 44 probably the biggest difference in this arizona cardinal team this year has been to play at their outside pass rushers and marcus golden with six sacks already sort of a james harrison kind of build to his play and he has been sensational the other side <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> with four sacks and that bookend approach finally they have that sort of pure 34 looking defense to attack an offense from the forty only frame swings a pass side to the 45 goes kristin michael itll be third down as we take a look at the arizona defense frosty weather usc <person player="corey peters" race="nonwhite" position="DT">corey peters</person> kentucky come on in trouble you <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite"

middle to pressure <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> fourth down yeah and <person player="nick vannett" race="white" position="TE">nick</person> van that a guy that they were excited about coming into this ballgame <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite"

player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> with <person player="john brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john brown</person> inactive tonight <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> strange running back punts wont have an opportunity here bc calls for a fair catch at the 12 yard line so the game has begun each team punting twice no score in glendale easy load here to <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david</person> reverb this <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> number two ranked wide receiver <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> the second ranked running back in the league is cheryl run blocking why that <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> elusive plays often in the slot these days <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> number one in missed tackles irene davidson did they mention my name <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> big big jets fan he was here on monday night to watch his team get down 28 to 3 but they make sure he s coming back to under eight minutes to play first quarter ball at the 13 yard line im exploring a whole is <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> very close to a first down over left guard he goes he comes into the game averaging five yards per carry good double team over there on the lefthand side and <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> kind of very patient it s one of the things he learned from the older <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> who s hurt now on this team he was always a sort of big powerful speedy guy but he got to the national football league and he learned sometimes you have to slow down sometimes you have to allow that double team to take place in that time jarred balladeer <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> s body once they got up on the defensive tackle got some movement and then <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> got through their game nine second down for the 2yard line and some patients finds the open spot around the left side tackle by mccrae and it s a first down for the cardinals now dont you get the feeling that this arizona offense is shifting just a little bit you know so many of the big plays in the passing game and deep bombs and bruce arians loves throwing the ball down the field but it s quite possible now that their best players <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> the running back and so you almost feel like that maybe if they could get to some play action passing establish the run that some of those big plays might come back definitely i mean theyre theyre running it more making fewer deep shots of this to this point decision and johnson finds no limits interesting krista the the the difference in these two teams arizona running it war not taking as many deep shots and seattle which used to be the running team of course marshawn lynch as retired is now throwing the ball more than they have in years we talked about <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> watch him come here off the edge and get <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">dj humphries</person> and just take him straight back <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">humphries</person> has added an element with his athleticism and tackled that from time to time he can still get powered when somebody gets underneath his chin second and ten left side too close to the 34yard line and that s gonna make a third down and about three shed makes the tackle as <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> and in the cardinals are quite happy to see him in civvies missing his second game groin issue and the hope to have him back next week when they go to face the saints in new orleans was this custom macray taking his spot wait for three guys to play with the chiefs third and three to the ground and making the catch histories <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> as he has done so brilliantly knew exactly how much you need me for a first time and that moves the sticks just dont know if there s been a better catcher of the ball in the national football league than this guy chris carter you think of jerry rice some of those kinds of guys but it s such a rarity i was watching tape the other day and he dropped a fairly simple ball and i just like to roll it back go is that <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> on that play but the biggest difference with <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> s game now bruce arians told them hey i can get you a hundred passes a year but you got to come in here and block and more often than not he will be at the point of attack on one place and he is again here is caught here by <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> takes it out to the 50yard line theyre trying to get him going drop some passes early on and then got him a touchdown throw last week against the jets and picks up a first down here and that s probably one of the things that has been missing this year from the big play element because <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> in the past was one of those you know the 50/50 balls they call them where you go down the field and youve got a smaller corner on you and just throw the ball up in there and let him go up and get it and so far this year that really has an apple i strive at a quarter by either team 50 the best kind of the albergue bounds boy coming back to receive it incomplete and that will make it second down in 10 and <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> number 55 came in and pounded <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> he carroll over on the sidelines of course had his hands full a week ago with that sort of sideline blow up with <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> there were some blown coverages some blown communications and it was interesting peat instead of going over and screaming and yelling he just sort of let them handle it then he goes saying i know who i had over there i know how those guys operated i mean theyd figure it out and he turns that into a positive it could be a good thing second and 10 jansen about three itll be third down back to last week s game against atlanta in the coughed up a 14point lead couple of blown coverages of course she had <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> out yet gray in and his chris rashard who can be a little volatile himself the defensive coordinator and there they were and chris rashard i talked to him this week and he said yeah then there came the happy dance at the end where they all come back picking up <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> and bouncing but christmas card said you know hey ive gotta examine what i do sometimes i get mad and i should let those guys breathe for a minute over there before i come after them 237 rusher paid on and he s gonna get sacked justice enveloped at his own 45 yard line <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">clark</person> comes in april comes in as well half the defense fourth down maybe the best pass rusher is <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> a roll coming off the edge over here going to try and block him with a tight end good luck with that and then youve got <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> the things how arizona has gotten beat in the past out against this bunch is they get in those third and long situations there are times against seattle s defense you have to just say the football were not going to take a big chance and turn it over this is their third punt already and it bounced at the five and takes a great bounce for the cardinals and theyre going to pin them at the one as good as it gets for their new doctor quickly as usual an array of bigname stars dropping by tonight shows so justin timberlake hell be there steve martin will be there as well can i choke any family or just a university of phoenix stay seattle pin to begin this time the litters from space kristin michael for no gain we second down and ten bunji gunther came in there alan almost got a safety out of that one now is great penetration coming right there and this is a seattle offensive line that is extremely young they have not played together much they have not spent much money offensive line and center dressed in brooklyn third different position in the last three years <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> that out of the gun and throws and that s going station and afford so <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> you go back to week one that played miami in seattle and he sustained an ankle sprain and then a knee injury against the rams in week 3 at cl wearing a brace and that s been limiting him at least in terms of his wanting the season he said he s felt better than he has in a while so he s gaining some confidence that clearly this is a different <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> 100 or 200 yards rushing at all so far this season third and six in the final minute of the opening quarter pressure put on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> just has to throw it away wilkin cardinals were coming in and up the punt from the end zone one of the marquee matchups on the outside <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> in the pro bowl every year of his career matched up against <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> who i thought had one of the really remarkable runs that ive ever seen for a wide receiver 11 touchdowns in his last six games of 2015 and tied for the league lead with 14 on the season that matchup will be fun to watch tonight marquee on both sides on here after from ryan short kick and <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> set up the cars with good field position at the 33 yard line as we go to michelle well you mentioned the injuries to <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> week three in the win over san francisco he sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee stabilizes the inner thigh bone to the upper shin bone and it is involved in every motion than me makes so change of direction throwing on the wrong those are both impacted and as you said that s on top of the right high ankle sprain ii suffered the first week of the season out and michelle he is not missed any action at all and that s a very good thing for seattle because their backup quarterback is a rookie <person player="trevone boykin" race="nonwhite" position="QB">trevone boykin</person> that s it just kind of on lesson to be there every week and he has been only doesnt matter from the 33yard line twentynine seconds left in the quarter a shirt again doesnt do this often and slides to a stop after a nineyard games takes the ball to the 24 yard line and that will probably take us into the next quarter it was <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> and <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">watford</person> roll <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">watford</person> rouge really a backup right guard took care of him on that one i think bruce arians is just now breathing after <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> took off running on that one with the bad hamstring into the first nil nil sunday night football back after these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico down upon the arizona state fair those water slides service is a nice place to be at this time of year steinke one degrees outside in glendale arizona temperatures that they got up almost to a triple figures very cool inside here all right the green bay packers fans everywhere by icy house traveled pretty well as well the seahawks come down here with maybe ten thousand or so fans from the seattle region theyre into saying we have to use the silent count sometimes in our own building they bring so many second and two to the outside to the 20yard lines you know it s an early season game but this is usually important especially in arizona because they can pull through than a half game otherwise seattle has a two and a half game lead and of course we know what that means arizona had the bye last year went to the championship game in the nfc seattle won a wild card game thanks to a blair walsh missed field goal and then they got beat the next week well and it s just a point of pride at this point as well because seattle s been coming down here every year and just kicking the heck out of them marian said i think theyre sick of watching all the tape i put on because ive been forcefeeding it down their throats this week johnson and he s gonna get corralled zack at the 21 yard line by tj wright loss of one second down and 11 this <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> is really something zero missed tackles on the season and we see him so many different times in coverage against tight ends in various parts of the field but he cleans up so many things <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> makes people miss all the time that <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right just has a wonderful way of staying in front of people in making plays second and 11 this bit johnson at to the left side empty the backfield seahawks blitz that s incomplete johnson looked around one of the flag doesnt get one bobbi wegner the line back through the coverage aryans upset about that noncoal third and 11 now youve got this one s scary here right you got <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> against the guy who effectively is a wide receiver who plays running back and really <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> has to give him a little better opportunity on that one i thought johnson did a good job of leaving some field where he could fade to make that catch and just slightly overthrown but if you get that kind of a matchup expect arian to come back to that one so the replay dont like it there get him 11 were stepping up and complete ciothes putting on a lot of heat evil again it s fourth down and theyll try to take a three nothing lead with a cat and zero field goal here boy <person player="andre ellington" race="UNK" position="RB">andre ellington</person> was wide open on to play but it looked like somebody got a piece of <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> s hand there was a table there comes <person player="andre ellington" race="UNK" position="RB">ellington</person> across the field watch this he was going to pick them but this first down there was nobody there so a 39 yard attempt now <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">chandler catanzaro</person> last time we were here on opening night bad snap boston the potential victory they had a nice snap here wouldnt you know it another problem a flag down that s <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> who comes in but you have a penalty marker cant touch anybody if youre going to jump over it s legal as long as you dont touch anybody and our in certain it s going to be on seattle it was a fourth and 11 <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> was not all sides on the play i didnt see him if he just touches the helmet or anything else at that center which he did right there that little toe tap is gonna cost them at the official saw it and the left foot on the numbers of the snapper but it results in a long conversation before mcauley gives us the call right beside him you had a table aruban holding down the guard there s no foul what a difference so they looked at the formation no foul no points still nothing nothing well bruce arians you can see what he s been doing for the whole commercial break on the sideline very upset about that call by the way that is not reviewable he wanted that play to be reviewed it s not reviewable that costs him a timeout as well timeout were going to challenge flag men think aryans is arguing that he hit the center when she did that plays not reviewable but there it s a foul if <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> had gotten too close to the center there you cant cover the center clearly he touched him clearly that should have been a foul they missed that one and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> was not close enough to the center to be considered covering him up so no foul there either and then losing a timeout he s like piling on at that point we throw a flag and it cant be reviewed that cost you a timeout kristin michael carries for a gain of about three and bruce arians who has not had a whole lot of luck this year with the kicking game they worst missed the kick against the new england patriots they had issues in the buffalo game this has been a long year for their special teams in particular the field goal team at the 34 second down and seven silva and nothing brawling in the second quarter his hands quickly for a first down to fall <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> takes his first grab of the night with speedy one second round pick back in 2014 you see so many of those tries for that when it s at the end of the game you dont often see it in the middle of game do you and here he comes right up the middle and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> obviously one of the great athletes here s a guy that s in the top ten of run defense past defense everybody <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> kuechly the only one that sort of matched him this season so far with everything that he s done at the 44yard line <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">willson</person> to the outside and just delving into the rulebook a little further incidental contact is not necessarily a penalty that s in the book so that was either they missed it or was ruled incidental contact or accidental you tell me can you explain the difference to me between an incidental contact and contact i thought the rule was supposed to be about player safety because you dont want guys flipping over and doing all that sort of side you know i think if you wipe the guy out is what theyre thinking about you tell them i gave you a water me too im like you always at 20 what s the difference whatever you want act whatever that s how i got whatever that s it let s drop the 50yard line right and out of the hands of <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> coming back after he missed the last five games last year with a patellar tendon injury which resulted in an operation and took him quite a while to get back he didnt play at all in preseason and he wasnt much of a factor the first couple of games but his return and fetching a lot of balls the last three games or so in this offensive because of ive been he s clearly not any third and 10 from the 44 seattle has only one first down and that s incomplete and a flag is thrown <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> was an intended receiver <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cooper</person> only who was the pawn were recovering on the play penalties on the guard below in ski and the the punting unit comes back in again for what will be the seventh putt of this contest yeah he was working over there against big coleus <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> and just had to hold on well talk more about this offensive line for seattle they have not invested a whole lot of money in it best they can hear tonight ryan s punt written gordon collection at the 11yard line and brings it back out to the 1911 in a hand to the hand nothing nothing chasing is the pressure to wit builds in martinsville virginia her junior broadcast booth apart the race that s that sunday i said <person player="joey hunt" race="white" position="C">joey</person> logano was responding around with a win at talladega to evade at the moment well there you go <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> went to northern iowa and so did the man on the right mr kurt warner went to three super bowls one woman with the rams power now the treats he s going to go keep that feel it take a shot and the pass is incomplete shed was back there with thomas covering on the play pass intended for <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> s second down in ten yeah it s that desean sheds done a nice job over there you think about what it s like playing opposite <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> youre gonna see so many balls come down the field here s a guy that was on their practice squad he was a safety he s just sort of filled in on special teams whatever he could and they absolutely love the fact they think he s one of the hardest workers on their team maybe not the most talented guy in the world he s about 220 pounds huge foreigner back but he just keeps making praise over there opposite <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> dont know where theyd be without in this shoe to the outside and johnson and he exploits that as he dances down the sideline for a good game tackled thereby <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right for him that s a first down and for a gain of 15 <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> through six weeks 833 scrimmage yards most in the league and before this day is done he could wind up as the rushing leader first cardinals player since back in the chicago days john <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david</person> crow the de league after week six and some of the changes up front with <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">earl watford</person> and <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">dj humphries</person> on that right side of line much more athletic than what they had in the past few years and it s really helped some of them stretch runs and further note that was their first year that he sent me a woman who seconded the crow to the 35 yard line gain of one here <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> tonight has already carried the ball 10 times but theyve limited him to 32 yards you know it s kind of fun talking to <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> about bruce arians bruce arians so hard but really hard on <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> i said give me some example that he said well i got named the nfc offensive player of the week one time but he refused to give me a game ball i was missing blocks and had a couple blown assignments in rough finding out a game war last week against the jets <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj</person> notion on the end he s able to get out to the 40yard line <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> making the tackle to be third down and four believe that <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> you know they picked <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> we all know how that worked out in the third round tremendous choice won the job as a rookie and then <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> was also picked in that same draft just ahead of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> when you talk about john schneider hitting the the jackpot there it was it s one of those poor guys they pay a lot of defensive players big money and it s well deserved and weve seen the results four straight years a number one scorer gumpa fair to johnson and instead of a loss on the play and another punt <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april came in and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> was able to get rid of the ball and put it into johnson s stomach in the first half that s as good as it gets for <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> right there he is dead to rights <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> averill had him throwing him to the ground and just flipped it out that looked almost like a <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> kind of a play and then <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> took over from there so this is a first <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> write down on the field down so an injury timeout still no score gang busters matchup on sunday night football next week the philadelphia eagles the dallas cowboys eagles hampton minnesota their first loss of the season today cowboys with a pi their 5 and 1/2 goes for to philly dallas next sunday night its first down flag is thrown the outside and that squad for what would be a 12 yard game and then another flag comes is it two fouls on the play <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> makes the catch might be one on <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> like he may have pushed off a bit at the top outside defense number 73 pass interference offense number 15 printed off strap that s michael bennet offside and there was a 12 yard game went away offsetting penalties here and he s no stranger to getting an offside call no he s not and bruce arians says guy lines up offsides all the time i said youre gonna mention that to the officials he said yeah before the game after the first play after the second play im just gonna talk about it all the time but he has been a nightmare and now that making bodies back here s <person player="andre ellington" race="UNK" position="RB">andre ellington</person> that gives <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> a little bit of a rescuer on this series takes the ball into seattle territory to the 49 yard line <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> over on the sidelines you know it s been interesting to follow what s happened with him this year since spring that knee in his ankle obviously some things that he s always done moving around scrambling around and such has been limited a bit but i think he has just improved so much as a pocket passer you see him almost like a tom brady or peyton manning getting the ball out of his hands very quickly now not letting that pass rush get to him the time of possession but there has been only one scoring threat in the game and that was the field goal that was taken care of by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> and resulted in no points and that s nothing nothing halfway through the second quarter you dont get to be the number one scoring defense four years in a row and not be pretty good so far we have really seen nothing thrown the way of <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> and one deep shot down the field that <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> but not much has been there they can get this running game going play action might work backers but not thus far it s <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> and he will shadow <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> going to the other side but the play clock was running down and a timeout is called here as we go to michelle well <person player="darren fells" race="nonwhite" position="TE">darren fells</person> was questionable with an ankle injury went back for xrays got the ankle spattered he s working on loosening that up to ron brown is questionable with a knee injury <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> left the field for a little bit ran to the xray room and when i say ran i mean he sprinted but they had been looking at the left side of his lower back he is back now on the bench and appears to be ready to go yeah there he is michelle and he s smiling as well he was <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> he was exactly what happened to him he s on <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> their little twist maybe of the back at that point and youll see him reach for that back here there he is it s the bend over michelle said he sprint s to the xray room and he s back on the bench and just trying to stay loose yeah he really does not particularly like covering smaller receivers like duck <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> he would prefer the big guys on the outside because you have to cover so many more routes that plays into slot you put virtually up to cover every possible route that there is playing in there and it s tougher for a guy <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> s pretty big guy third down and three arizona sickness a first down get it to seattle s one first down <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> makes the catch over the middle that takes the ball to the 42 yard line it s just so hard you get so much pressure coming from <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> he has so much quickness and speed and then all of a sudden he drops his head and puts his helmet right underneath your chin and you get thrown back into your own quarterback and i think <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> has learned over the years playing these guys you dont hold the football you dont give <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> that opportunity get away is johnson the yardage in this game is about a four to one ratio at this point the cardinals have gained 128 yards in seattle has been limited to 30 yards there is a little element missing though when cam <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> s not in the game isnt there i mean here s a 240 pound safety we saw him essentially knock <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> you potty out when he pulled around the last time they played in seattle but they bring him to every game because he s sort of the what they call him to bouncer over there anything gets going on the sideline it s up to cam chance it or take care of it perfect description and it s gonna set up a third down two or three johnson probing through the middle doing a good job on him tonight limiting him to about three yards per carry you can see my cue potty is just not right he s got that bad ankle he went out for a player so but this is one of the most powerful one blocking guards in the game and you can just see him hobbling around just a little bit here just feeling uncomfortable just have to keep an eye on him at the 34 thirtytwo johnson and he will enough for the first down to the 31yard line he goes for 40 left in the half pete carroll the ebullient effusive one always hard to believe when you think about an oldest coast in the league he s 65 you think back to he was an nfl coach back in 94 he coached the jets for one year before going to new england and the us seeing and a lot of success there obviously and then to seattle in 2010 their practices in seattle are more competitive than some games ive seen they go and practice and it shows out let s say they pick him up sometime and the pass is incomplete because the coverage is great <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> is back there covering <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> the intended receiver will be second down yeah thomas says i dont think so youre gonna get a little wheel route coming right up the way here and thomas just gonna go straight with him there arent many safeties in this league that can intimidate that can cover and that can lead a defensive unit he s a guy that by his own admission doesnt say a whole lot but lets his play speak for him out on the field he has an intensity about him that is infectious with this defense they have several guys like that but certainly <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> one of the leaders back there on three there s our throws and it s tip right was there at the 21 and itll be third down to ten good battle on the outside between these two soon to be legends <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> and one of the things <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> was telling us is that you know <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> s not quite as quick out of those brakes as he used to be and you can sit on him sometimes he noticed that revis was sitting on a few of his routes and he thought he could get away with the same stuff third and ten at the 31 in field goal range that every kick for arizona these days is an adventure whoops coming again <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> garlan that sermon is all over <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> s for just a short game fourth down and now that group will come in with <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> and <person player="aaron brewer" race="white" position="LB">brewer</person> the snapper <person player="ryan quigley" race="white" position="P">quigley</person> is the holder neither of those guys the snapper or the holder was with the team at the beginning of the year and here s <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> and of course theyll keep an eye on mr <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> this time well the table at <person player="ahtyba rubin" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rubin</person> the last time took the guard and sort of pulled his shoulders down i cant imagine jennair he s been a trying though he s been at this time and a 46 yarder is good so finally some points it takes almost 27 minutes three nothing hours all right next week starts with thursday night football per usual it s the jacksonville jaguars against the tennessee titans at about half past 8 on the nfl network arizona on this sunday night they lead three nothing white in contrast to the last two times seattle came in and they they blew him out early and two combined score of those games was 71 to 12 and it s a line drive kick that will be returnable from the oneyard line <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler lockett</person> when an outstanding rookie season takes us to the 17 <person player="justin bethel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin bethel</person> makes the tackle there and this will take over we talked about the batchat between <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> and <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> and <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> said that when youre covering a guy in the slot every route imaginable and every direction of a break imaginable is available to that wide receiver so far <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> just one catch for nine yards so <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> s been doing a nice job and that move off the line of scrimmage right there i think is the one that ended up hurting <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick peterson</person> s back pump dealing with wit guys like <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> play up the play so he reached through the back again here for an xray michael taking it out to the 23 yard line kristen michael interesting story because here s the guy was a high draft choice played his first two years in seattle he was backing up marshawn lynch s little immaturity came into play so they dealt him to dallas and then dallas let him go was on the washington redskin practice squad for a month and then last year when lynch was hurt and <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> was hurt they expect him back in a couple of weeks to go up michael back and now he s been there he guys issues and he picks up a first down here after the 29 yard line and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> knows how important he is to this team right now without marshawn lynch and <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> and all the guys that theyve had so he writes them a little inspirational note before they go into meetings at least once a week and trying to talk about how important it is to show up every day like it s the most important day of your life go to work and do some michael started that was only the second seattle first down that s incomplete pass is broken up ran the intended receiver <person player="tony jefferson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tony jefferson</person> covering on the play and that takes us to the twominute warning that much time left in the half 3nothing carnage for the halftime coming up the eagles and the vikings their first loss of the season if you havent seen that aj green catch hell enjoy that one it was a beauty <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> tirico look ahead to the jags and the titans which is the thursday night matchup james boettcher is the defensive coordinator second year took that one todd balls left here to become the head coach of the jets and his mirren has done a heck of a job tonight second out of 10 listen to the outside trying to stay with him and he does and that s a short game seattle was just two first downs to this point in the game another third down play coming up right here they are old for four on their third down conversions and were not seeing <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> scrambling escaping being the total nightmare that he s been against the arizona cardinals and some of their main coverage in the past he did try to run one there <person player="tony jefferson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tony jefferson</person> got him on that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> spreads amount orange <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> into the back here living another which the name free because he flag down so what would be a first down one at the waitandsee barton was indicated against seattle and concurred by karen to call me that s the right tackle <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">garry gilliam</person> all right right out there going against glaze <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> on the outside and clearly this is a team that is sort of making do at the tackle position right now <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> hsiao on the left side and <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">garry gilliam</person> on the other side theyve got some good young talent inside but more often than not theyre having to help those tackles outside it s 1/3 and 15 bring receivers of a bunch to the left crowd roaring and under pressure again and closing at the feet of <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> theyre at a hard time connecting the night miss fourth and 15 sandler <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jones</person> with the windmill at offseason acquisition from new england here we go on the other side against sal here and i think this was one of the great acquisitions that arizona came up with because when <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> got on the left side and marcus going on the other side all of a sudden they had bookends and so they couldnt have an offense that would help one side or the other they had equal pressure coming off both sides and it just difference on this defense this would be john ryan s of the game it s a good 150 yards brings it back to the 25 so a minute remaining in the half dispose of greenup sunday night football being brought to you by bmw we want to make one thing the ultimate driving machine by verizon join the better network because better matters by subway try the new thick cut autumn carved turkey sandwich by geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance arizona state fair doing that 430 years from over a million distance over two and a half week period every fall so far this seattle offense oh four five on third downs and arizona four four nine that really the difference in the game and when <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> has 10 more yards rushing than <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> you know get a strange first half working so that last note more points than any team in the final two minutes of the half as far this season oneyard gain here johnson taken out of bounds here <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> take a look at what happened to him so he s out for the moment and you know <person player="john brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john brown</person> is not playing do ron brown was back in the locker room <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> reached for his hamstring so they have <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> in the game this <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> on the bench and theyre down to their one four and five receivers now with <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> now is the speed guy number 14 is the one guy that has the ability to strike quickly going to be four and five of course fitz s number one second down and eight is almost picked and thomas me thinks he had it he comes away there s a flag down to begin with here and far in the past folding because number 25 it s moved as to whether he got it or not that <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> called for the penalty we saw his arm wrapped around the right shoulder let s see if well you tell me you know sometimes you know theyre looking from a long way away i always think what s hard to tell is okay the arm is there is he really impeding the progress or is the arm just their official that time i thought the progress over the 32 yard line first down the left side but he closed that one out of bounds <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> have a step that time but he was already on the chalk as the ball came down second and ten now these receivers are doing a decent job giving <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> a little field remember <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> earlier and left some room on the outside and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> missed that one and really <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> was open here and the ball just thrown off the field baumer 12 was 21 the only so every little bit more than four yards to pass the only offensive numbers for sizing pretty terrible second okay preview sling the defender away is <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine gresham</person> picks up a first down stays inbounds picks up a few more yards and finally gets out of bounds with 104 pushed <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> out of the action yeah this a little forearm shiver to the side there and get off on me and then runs up close to the first down but really all aggression was trying to do was just run out of bounds and stop the clock and <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> basically kept him from doing it and almost cost him two first down the third and one then the girl comes into the slot the first down is johnson gets it up to the 43 yard line now is when you really have to pick up the pace though you cant fool around and obviously seattle lie on top of the ball carrier and trying to lay it all that they can one time out for arizona as close to a first down they want to conserve that time up and now they figure they can so <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> has to take it here with 31 seconds all of the passing tonight at least the successful passing has been underneath bomber 14 of 16 when he throws short and old for 7 between 11 yards and 100 and remember bruce arians lost the timeout trying to challenge that play were <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> jumped over and you werent allowed to challenge it and it cost them a timeout and it may come into play in a big way here it s second down and inches with the ball of the 47 yard line not busy throws and the basses incomplete so the coverage is outstanding you see three seahawks around <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gresham</person> and the pressure was put on <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> at a throw of his back foot third and inches they just keep putting so much pressure on you saw eight guys up around the line of scrimmage on that particular play theyre just theyre not going to allow bruce arians any cheap and easy completions to set up a field goal try here before the end of the half were down on one now you need to at least convert here it just feels like that this is going to turn into a <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> kind of a game that he s the best receiver may be out there that <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> and bess rahner they give it to him here and then spike it out of bounds is finding moammar a guy who has barely been in the game second year guy out of boston college and they let him loose then he picks up the first down the gain of 23 coming right down here and they brought some pressure <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> drew the coverage off with him seattle up there playing tight on that third down and one and they go for it third foul deer on the outside taking care of <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> who could get a little tired after all these pass rushes they bought the field a while this afternoon how is the first catch of his career he left the practice squad and weak for now and incomplete <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> the intended receiver that <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> with him step per step and youve got 17 seconds they are still playing <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> on the outside against <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> oneonone they took a deep shot on that before but <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> is playing a good 10 11 yards off in that type of defensive alignment they could just raise up and throw the ball to johnson who s pretty darn good in the open field and still have time i think to get up and spike the ball thick field goal in the 25 on a second to 10 fourman rush and he tries to dump it out a dozen but now you have 22 pressure on the clock is running down they have no time they have no timeouts there was a defensive shot somebody came in with a floor arm and may have stopped this clock before the half ended otherwise there was no chance for the clock to be stopped so <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> was under pressure just trying to dump it off what <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">watford</person> was the only guy around it so he of course would be an intellectual receiver then you got the action after the play and the question is when they put any time back on the clock <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> came in he s the guy who comes in with a late shot there he is as the clock was running down and of course you can see mccauley reaching for the flag so there s your penalty on that side it was very close to whether that clock ran out im sure that s what theyre discussing if it s a defensive penalty because they will get that additional snap could be offsetting here there are two fouls after the play unsportsmanlike conduct on the offense will pull the player off the pas personal foul unnecessary roughness he fist number 20,000 kirk after the play the clock ran out that s the end of the first half wow so the cardinals squander an opportunity to make it six nothing settle for a three nothing lead at the break coming up next is the toyota halftime after these messages tonight s first half highlights are brought to you by chevrolet the cardinals take the video ready to meet the seahawks on sunday night football pressure put on and he s gonna get sacked youre gonna try and block him with a tight end good luck with that another problem we got a strange first half work chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row there you go at the half so hockey score 3 nothing arizona leading seattle the buzz <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> it s only the second time in 70 career starts he s been held scoreless in the first half <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> tonight 15 of the 26 130 <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> leading the league in yards from scrimmage has 83 total there and week 17 last year it was 30 to 6 at the end of the first half seattle and tonight it is 3 nothing arizona al michaels cris collinsworth michele tafoya on sunday night big big game as far as the standings are concerned in this division arizona would be a half game out with a win or two and a half back with a loss seattle gets the ball and start the second half and gonna run it out of the end walk it to the outside he finds its bumped out of bounds up at the 28 yard line and we go to my show well a laughter seattle s defensive stand to end the first half i had trouble corralling pete carroll as he left the field he was sprinting around from defender to defender slapping their helmet saying that s what im talking about and here we go second half when he did slow down he told me we have to start over we got nothing going offensively it doesnt matter why we just have to start over you gotta love watching this guy here if he is loving his defense and what s not to love with those guys but offensively let s see if they can get something rolling here in the third quarter or they really miss a lot see it so much now without marshawn lynch wisten michael theyre going to get <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> back in a couple of weeks who started the year as the starter got burton michael s done a pretty decent job tonight he s only carried the ball five times now for totals 19 yards you know one guy that really has made a difference up front is justin brett a guy that has moved up and down that offensive line from tackle to guard now into center and if there s been one bright spot up there it has clearly been him second down and six michael setting up the third entreat you know chris another really interesting thing is arizona s had the ball over 22 minutes seattle s had the ball about eight minutes in seattle s last 10 regularseason games they have had the time of possession advantage then tonight way down complete reversal and i thought it looked like seattle s defense was a little worn out there at the end of the half some of their best pass rushers you could tell they had been on the field for a long time so seattle has to start converting some third downs just to give that defensive break theyre all four five on third have only two first battles in the game mrs fire number three and he finally connects the gram he s targeting him a couple of times tonight gets it into him here where he first down on a gain of 14 yeah really one of their core plays sending him down and then sending <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> outside and look at that shot there by dj swear injure right at the bad knee of <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> and he said it happened to him the first time against the rams and sort of took his breath away and he got up from that and said well if i survived that i must be alright while the 49yard line man that s the catch flag on the play however thermoforming would give us the cool pass interference for 15 that is curse he pushed off before making the catch back to come working against <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus cooper</person> up here there s always at the top of the round a little stuff but i dont know you know again it s easy to see the arms extended it s harder to see if it had an effect and you know these guys sometimes back judges are 25 30 yards away so they just got to do the best they can seattle has not run a single play from arizona territory gonna keep this penetration has been 46 get stuff michael does buy coleus <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> doing yeomen work again tonight here in the league out of university of miami callay is <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> and watch trying to get him cut off there s just no way leia s <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> is one of those guys when he walks out on the field and you get a look at him six eight and just a monster of a guy consistently gives them five plus sax every single year never got a lot of recognition finally started getting to some pro bowls people know what kind of player he is now you think youre the phoenix suns game appeal and another flag here and that s going to make it second 26 offensive coordinator for the seahawks narrow bevel a lot of success of his run there but tonight cant get anything going pretty good arizona defense they were sharp last week too though the jets out of the end zone just limited to three second twenty six little stream michael defense very well banking through there is they own whose cannon to make the tackle after a short gain gain two to one of the magical parts of this defense and what they do is they play a defensive back guy that was a safety in college at linebacker day home buchanan and when you watch this team they just look faster than other teams and it s because they have smaller quicker guys on the field and it s hard to know is the league really moving entirely in that direction where it s just all about speed and coverage guys third and 24 from the 35 yard line eight yards no problem there <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> tackled by dj square injure fourth and 16 and another punt i swear injure gave him a little lift last week didnt he came in with some big hits an interception and it s allowed them to take <person player="tyrann mathieu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tyrann mathieu</person> and move him back to what he does best which is playing the slot where he has been one of the best in the national football league his new ryan sixth bunny s averaging 48 yards could be golden back to get this one is gonna be well short of that average and goes out of bounds and theyll mark that outside the 20 official stops at the 24 yard line but the only 33 yards back in arizona michele tafoya and i spoke with bruce arians in halftime asked how they might open up things offensively and he said if theyll get their hands off of us and stop holding us well be fine and he said the refs need to do a better job of getting their hands off of us he did acknowledge they did have some deep targets available and simply missed them by the way theyll be without wide receiver jurong brown he s been downgraded to ow ow all right thank you michelle we talked about <person player="john brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john brown</person> he s out so you get two three guys are out in <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> playing with the short deck with michael boy does comeback common gets rocked as he releases and that s <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> abel spent a good portion of the first half in the arizona backfield what else is new when you bring pressure in the middle it means sometimes that you have to block down and when you block down youre gonna end up with a guy like <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april coming off the edge with absolutely nobody <person player="jared veldheer" race="white" position="OT">jared</person> val dear just let him go and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> had no idea there this is not a turnover secondly ten here goes jennison and just a sheer will made of six one of the knocks on <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> coming out of college we knew he could catch the football but people didnt think maybe he was tough enough to run between the tackles and he was sort of a former wide receiver but he has proven himself inside one of the most elusive backs in the game 25 missed tackles already this season and he is a big strong tough guy and clearly in my mind the difference in his first half he has been the biggest part of the offense really on either team behind the arch and scrimmage you go five wide here and he got action on the right side of the seattle defensive line that s <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank</person> yep third and three in a first down that hurts moves it to the 36 yard line seattle penalized five times 235 hours only one penalty tonight for ten yards there you go good veteran quarterback play there breathe his own 36 yard line with tosh good show the age of 33 still doing it gain of eight so <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> what a career he s had little doubt hell be on the steps of canton someday the question is how much longer for for <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry</person> he s got amused about maybe retiring he s 33 years old bruce arians told us the other day said he thinks hell keep going as long as <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> keeps going i should allow you to want to break in a rocky quarterback you wonder if they might be a package deal <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> adversary you know there s three been riding this train a while now second two is johnson again showing a pace just trying to find enough room that he does and takes the ball in the midfield strike making shed with him first now that s what you love to see the kind of fight that s going to come with this here and then just keep spinning and come back inside and make sure he picked up that first down sheds know little guy about 220 pounds and <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> wasnt going to give up and this is that kind of game out i mean when you talked about it this is a really important game for these two teams theyre half game back for two and a half back play action that buys time and then johnson makes a catch and it s about eight more to his yards from scrimmage total taking the ball of the 43 yard line he is great picking up yardage after contact there s his wife megan he got married in the off season and theyve gonna have a baby very excited about nori and were starting to see right now to that because of the work megan s husband they are now getting some play action passing doing that this pass rush is slowing down second down and two from the 43 shut up bye shed flag is down and knocked back box tops seven minutes remaining in the third cardinals are sure this is against seattle the seattle defense is reacting theyre sure to after the play personal foul against our office depilatory that s <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> again came and lead at the end of the first half and that puts them securely in field goal range as the ball goes down to the 28 yard line <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> was hitting blocked here right there he got his hand up underneath the facemask and it was lame just before the half who almost got that pal as well so there s the shot and it s keeping this drive moving now trailing thin now in the backfield they give it to him and before he can take it away but on the flag before a tie then <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">jermaine gresham</person> time of possession of course one sided arizona s had the ball twice as much and theyve had about three times as much yardage and in terms of first downs at that one to this list arizona has 15 and seattle is 3 this is a green bay packers chicago bears and the snow in the mud defensive work woody hayes and they said beckwith yeah over the middle making the catch stickiness at the 26 yard line is <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gresham</person> tackle there by reuben drop and they do a lot of this sort of zone blitz tough drop out one of the defensive lineman reuben went right in there and for <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> he has been in that position way too much tonight this offense just unable to convert on third down first rashard knows his defense theyre playing well but how long can they hold it together here last two defensive coordinators gus grantland dave quinn wound up with hook coaching job to jacksonville in the llano respectively he s it s time back at the 26yard line right is there making it a third and eight why are we so impressed with the tackling of the seattle seahawks there s a reason that theyre ranked so high every single year they call it heart tackling where theyve been trained in the offseason taking the ball getting in and once they grab and get wrapped up twisting so that that ball carrier starts worrying about his knees and ankles getting hurt and gets him to the ground quickly third and eight arizona six out of eleven converting on third down johnson but he s gonna probably be tackled a little short of it let s see where they spot it right makes the stop theyre gonna spot it inches short no now mccall d comes in and he says first down and one of the other officials is hold on a second let s measure so terry s coming and he staying moving the chains and then the other guy says wait a second hold on johnson on the outside of the bunch and youre gonna see right there <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right just coming in and make one of those hot tackles here get that knee on the ground i think he was short of it didnt you i did absolutely mccauley signaled first down there the elbows down and the baby before that first and time i was taken by seattle to mull it over so they measured and well short of the first down half a yard certainly so recharge defense ariane s making the call at least for the moment ariane s is leaving his offensive group out on the field at the 18 yard line passing up for the moment anyway what would be a 36 yard attack so then they run the flier in the australian hit them kwan/wong shot by the tight ends to that right side and they give it to johnson and boy that s the hurry close and again doesnt look like he gained anything and if he didnt it s going to be seattle s ball we deleon pile johnson through the middle put it down at just about the same spot there s no gain and they turn it over to the seahawks four and a half left in the third and remains three nothing set that at football being brought to you by southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that strain sparing see by toyota let s go places by microsoft surface the official tablet of the nfl and by nationwide nationwide is on your side it s friday night perry hi <person player="steven terrell" race="UNK" position="DB">steven</person> by gilbert the penalty for the first time is than those guys so the defense holds arizona now goes to work from his own 18 get nothing going good three yards per play caught up at the 21yard line <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> makes the catch mean of a couple well they stopped him on fourth down thanks to their star players glyph april first then <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right and then <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> s going to clean it up at the end april kind of shoots down in the gap and forces johnson to stutter jay wright got a piece and then <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> dropped him to his knees four minutes left in the third so the 26 setting up a third and three for the seahawks that defense has been on the fields so much tonight last thing they want to see here is a throwing it out i just cant remember a game in which i have not seen <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> scramble around and make it i cant remember one that ill see going to go back to the knee of the egg whowho s it but you tell me six possessions six months well go 5 wide and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> fires over the meadow or christ in and then the ball comes out at the end of the play and mccauley comes in there and it hasnt been a whistle until now here comes here comes lags all over the joint so there we go again wait jefferson s walking away it s as if arizona is going to be the guilty party here laius <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> knock down the pass and it went right back to <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s arm who tried to run for the first down and then after that everything went berserk so <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> winds up at the bottom of the pile all kinds of laundry being thrown and another conference here did the ball come loose and is that why everybody was scrambling and did that there s some files after the play a sports or like conduct office they were suddenly six coming off the pile i supposed to like knock 92 defense play off the pile the pool is all set at the dead wall spot fourth down i said <person player="germain ifedi" race="nonwhite" position="OT">germain</person> of fetty the number one draft choice and frosti <person player="frostee rucker" race="nonwhite" position="DE">rucker</person> or the guys who get the penalties plays <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> is going to come on this loop and knock the ball backwards and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is going to take it out of midair and then marcus golden is going to make the tackle on it and then here we go and pulling people off the pile is a penalty i think for the first time this year that theyve instituted that we seen it now three different times here what they want to do is keep all that junk from happening nema goes is a reception for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> like brett favre s for silver for real ryan s the golden gets taken down right there by thor and back comes bomber you show the season on nbc we think youll enjoy very much chicago med then you configured this thursday the medical drama coming your way thursday night right here on the national broadcasting company mikey bonnie is back in he s been in and out there he is big enogh number 76 wall to 20yard line jesse so marcin <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> is 14th year won the heisman trophy back in oh and who was his coach pete carroll who was his teaming chris rashard the defensive coordinator so he knew that that rashard would be a coach someday said he just had he had that aura about him and then of course we talked to <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> about pete carroll and when when pete came in actually it was parsons junior year before he had taken over for by tuesday 14 of about three so i love you know you get with <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> really bright guy 36 years old but in the legal long time what did he say in terms of what did pete carroll teach you dont give the defense too much credit they were walking off talking all this philosophy and all of a sudden pete just stopped said hey dont give those guys that much credit now he s out here in a three nothing game and you got to give the defense a little bit of credit but it really was pete carroll who sort of changed the career path of <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> not very good at all his first year at usc which was his junior year comes back his senior year and pete said forget all this strongarm stuff let s get the ball out of your hand let s get some completions going and end up winning the heisman trophy i mean when s the heisman becomes the norm or know who will pick in the draft johnson picks up a hardearned first down before he is driven back by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> so took him down to a minute to go in the third quarter <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> one of the great blockers but <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> one of the great linebackers and just discarded the wide receiver here to make the play but not before he was able to pick up that first down and you know how this is just the difference in the game is that johnson is able to finish these runs a little bit better and is converting a few first downs barely in this game but it is not much more than that this is just a slugfest of great defensive football baumer dropping back in the corner and then over the <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> and he gets taken down from behind of the 45 yard line by the shawn shed otherwise he might have gone all away dean 224 yards nice job here by <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> s squeeze and back out to the outside against shed and then using that speed to break across the middle ill tell you when you see a 20 yard completion in this game it the place becomes electric there just hasnt been many of those the coverage has been good on the outside for sure into three three nothing arizona aerial coverage that is being brought to you by geico now michaels with cris collinsworth michele tafoya mr fred goodell the director to wisconsin tonight football theyre the standings against the animal comes in four and one having won three in a row arizona three and three and again theyre either a half game back or two and a half back or the cardinals in the poor seattle would have a commanding lee next week s action first things first three nothing and the first time here five yards weve talked about <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> in all the different places he lines up and all the different things that he does but so far it has been several guys having a nice game a cue <person player="aq shipley" race="nonwhite" position="C">shipley</person> has done a good job against him the undersized guy in there playing center but no matter where he s lined up they have had plenty of bodies on him you have to wonder just how healthy is after getting that meat dinged up a week ago but he has not had the total impact that weve had seen him have on this offense multiple times before definitely second man is five from the 40 this is 20 second carry of the ninth and gets pushed all the way back and crowd wants a flag but there is none and <person player="matt wile" race="UNK" position="P">matt</person> <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> all the places he lines up chris it s everywhere i mean there s no way to have a decent scouting report he does lineup a little bit more outside as a pass rusher but 13 times or so that he lines up at linebacker on the inside so a very difficult guy to try and scheme against but i think he s you know it s just been a tough night theyve been on the field forever tonight and usually theyre on and off the field very quickly that s what the first time sucks the stumbling stays on his feet and gets all the way to the 14 but a flag down flag is back at the 29 yard line line of scrimmage was the 37 holy that s <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> again i think he grabbed the outside of the jersey and just as the play was beginning to break away take a look right there and then when <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> started to break away you can see the the jersey fully in hand and so that s usually a pretty good indicator when you see the defensive back do a pirouette and then on the inside you see <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> cracking down on <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> so he s been hit by everybody on the field now so it was it was third down and two but now it s third and four he s that s a spot bowel comes back from where it occurred instead of a first down and a 14yard gain you back of the 39 but it s third down and four and jumping it is <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> to break it up and need him in off to the races and that was <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> but the heat on me <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> getting rid of the blow on a hurry so fourth down and they gonna bring in the punting group <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> came from about 12 yards deep that time and almost made this play he recognizes it right away knew exactly what it was and almost had a pick six right there so theyre not going to fool around with a potential 57 yard <person player="ryan quigley" race="white" position="P">ryan quigley</person> sends it down to the 8 yard line by out of lie it there the penalty three nothing it remains coming up on the halfway mark of the season already the way thursday night and if fell now were gonna have it for you about half past eight jacksonville against tennessee 3a fewer points the first reporters arizona at the jets back in 2012 the remains 3nothing 13 minutes and regulation and as a sevenyard game here which is a big game these nights or these this particular night for <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> run out by <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cooper</person> second down i tell you you have to appreciate what arizona does with james better on the defensive side theyve got him backed up and theyre still bringing blitzes theyre slanting the line theyre bringing blitzes and linebackers and no fear i mean you could just see it there is no fear from james boettcher and what he s gone it s a gain of nine second down and one the longest game that i see out of four and so first im here for michael you know that one teams have the ball more than the other when you win the time a possession battle you clinch it before the end of the third quarter they hand it over 30 minutes in the first three quarters thirty to fifty right out of 1450 top so theyre adore me now the frontdoor me it s good overtime under 12 to play is only the fourth first out of the night for the seahawks <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">willson</person> under pressure sliding away flag is thrown again as he swings that one alliance marcus golden number 44 putting the heat on marcus golden spent a problem tonight always a good listener so mccauley looks over he wants to know where theyre airing his once thing to play and hell take the hell take the 10 yards penalties on the left tackle <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> salad yeah and one of the things they knew of course al was here in arizona and they knew he was going to have a tough time trying to hold up against these bull rushes going right back into him and they thought that not only could they go through him but they could also squeeze the pocket in on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> so basically he wouldnt be able to scramble around that happen in addition defensively theyre also sort of taking one of their pass rushers and rushing them up the middle but not very hard to make sure that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> doesnt get out and beat him with some runs burst in 20 from the 11yard and then deep downfield and bormann cannot make a onehanded track so she s done many many times in the past home to jefferson with the coverage second down to 20 well what <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> has done as the dual threat as you can see i mean last year 553 yards the year before 849 when they go to the super bowl and lose of course the new england two in the end of the game this year just 33 yards so you know he contends that we say who blew the ankle and the knee and all of that but obviously it s a factor but the other thing is that they made <person player="cj spiller" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj spiller</person> receiving threat in order to play <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> but bo sighs really so far hasnt been a factor second and 20 zoom in to the outside great ball loose and it s michael who s their mentor made the tackle almost comes up with it and it s third and a mile upcoming that s was this ball out and was a knee down elbow down up good call you know you this is one of those circumstances third and a million you go okay you dont want to do anything crazy here clock is ticking down here so at some point you got to try bird and a quarter in the field 25 yards and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> is going to shovel it precise and he gets hit after a gain to the couple by who else dj swearengen no dj swear injure was one of those guys early in his career was getting fined by the league office he like about every other week four hits to the helmet they brought him in here they thought he could be a really good player and they worked forever with him to get his head out of some of these tackles and now when he comes up and takes people on weve seen him put on some devastating but legal hits and past few weeks he mogul from the bucket he while i answered a busy night for almost a lot of bounds at the 48yard and stayed in so arizona has it on the seattle half of the field but by 3:00 sunday night football being brought to you by the ford fseries the official truck of the nfl by kelowna extra inviting you to find your peach and buy ge the digital company that s also an industrial company seahawks forty years in the national football league and won that title with <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> at the helm in the 13th season of course we were here for the new england game which came never so close she has to knock and <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">butler</person> had other ideas so now you got <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock</person> coil 52 is in there as where is on the sidelines and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> and attention to the 44 and what about <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> was movable michelle well after the end of that last defensive series <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> went to the locker room with cramps weve been told he has an iv and he s back out here didnt miss a snap although he is not on the field at the moment and there is <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby</person> coming back out here but just at this moment comes back out with nine and a half to go it is second down to five see that little cotton ball theyre going to get blood us they put that little piece of cotton onion ivy ramp up again but he s a well that s knocked down at the line of scrimmage and we third down and five you know it almost is starting to feel now like if arizona s offense cant get it going and seattle s defense cant win the game you know theyre gonna have to come up with a way and we saw hurled thomas take a shot that s trying to go pick one up at some point when you begin to realize your offense cant do it defensively you take some chances and sometimes when that happens you give up big plays for touchdowns give it a homeless their average this year tonight weve had three points they will knock that last pass down third and five a little one slip pitch away and then <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> get some work before i ask possession that s incomplete and it s <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> knocking it away little area shot fourth down yeah and what happens <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> drops the ball so he cant really tell what s gonna happen here there he is he s going to drop coverage and come back in and although stately <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> s head off there now quickly to punt bounces at the one and then slides into the endzone <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> the hit of the night with 907 to go three nothing cards wednesday night rivalry night national hockey league action on nbcsn original six the bruins they know chara the rangers rangers beat the coyotes earlier today at madison square garden three two more scoring in that game than weve had tonight amazing really it s fun for me to watch a defensive fight like this that last part was only twenty four yards it s giving into the end zone it s a 1yard game here for kristen michaels stop by coleus <person player="calais campbell" race="nonwhite" position="DE">campbell</person> second down well one of the things you have to do to <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is you cant let them beat you outside the pocket so watch what they do they sort of build a little steel cage around him and make sure that he s not moving around too much and he cant step up and through the way that he has sometimes in the past second and nine and he tries to get it away the ball is loose and recovered back at the two yard line <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> came in created the fumble and knocks him all the way back inside the to tomahawk and i dont know if this is going to end up hurting <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> or not he s moving that shoulder around watch this tomahawk chop right down is that arm started to come forward and the issues with the tackles on the outside for the seahawks is becoming a problem yeah that has to heard the torque there now you could see him he was rotating that shoulder after that play was over marc lewinsky the guard was able to recovered it stirred down a 29 and wasnt makes the catch up at the 13 but in comes ryan for what will be his ninth punt of the night this offense is no slouch but i tell you what james boettcher and his crew have done an unbelievable job look at this angle that s like a 45degree angle and that turn just so he can get that tomahawk chop down look at that just laying out around the corner used to see <person player="robert nkemdiche" race="nonwhite" position="DT">robert</person> <person player="evan mathis" race="white" position="OG">mathis</person> and white freeney remember those guys turning at that torqued angle like that coming around the edge select a cue ler play so a <person player="evan mathis" race="white" position="OG">mathis</person> last week and then youve got <person player="bradley sowell" race="white" position="OT">bradley</person> salad the left tackle who gets the attention here it was seven and a half to go now in the fourth quarter meanwhile were talking about better in his defense there theyre trying to pitch their second touchdown shutout in the roby s the jets were limited to a field goal on monday night and three points here another reason this game is so huge with the point out that if you look at the schedule of arizona they have five of their last seven games on the road and six of their last nine felt like they gave away one early but this is yeah this is an offensive line just so you understand what s going on with seattle they pay a lot of guys on the defensive side of the ball and they obviously play <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and duck ballwin and some guys but this offensive line is probably the least expensive offensive line in all of football right and here s ryan s kick collection to 32 brings it back to the 39 7eleven good on the come out roll left to the for three nothing arizona that s where we are this and that s the way well end october on sunday night a beauty next week is those cowboys johnson now up to the 43 yard line on the first down latynina for second down and six johnson tonight 24 carries 84 yards and part of the reason that <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> has been able to do this <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> you potty jerod balladeer on the inside these guys watch this doubleteam coming in here against a tava ruben who is a big guy i mean that is getting movement and then you could see <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right the linebacker behind him he cant get through the mess so it doesnt look like much but four yards four yards four yards and you got the first down and that sort of been the formula for the cardinals tonight six and a half to go second down and six as a first down taking it to the seattle 47th but hold everything flag down 42 yard line pulling off 42nd are holding all on the tight end <person player="jermaine gresham" race="nonwhite" position="TE">gresham</person> great jump cut that time by <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> but fresh them out here another one of those things you know youre youre thinking this runs going inside and all of a sudden you feel pressure <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> trying to get to the outside and just end up grabbing them theyve been consistent theyve been calling this one all night and now youve got a one loose ariane s is such an aggressive play and yet youre in one of those kind of games and your defense is doing so well boy that s a tough sighs here s your left tackle sow on the park <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> who gets him bellick back of the 23 yard line <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> averell spent a good part of this night in that arizona backfield first guy in on the sack lawson 9 we have two offensive linemen responsible for one guy and he still gets there that s pretty good nice move by averell inside what a tremendous talent he has been number one since he came in the league with 24 sack fumbles and he has just been relentless tonight it s a half a sack third down and 25 sanna may wind up with one decent field position for a changed joshu seattle has not had the ball tonight in arizona territory not only didnt shut out the deepest penetration is their own 46 well when you make <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> miss a tackle you know youve got some moves in the open field johnson coming down here and here s <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> to got him square it up and just cant quite hang on to him but that was a big sort of 15 yard run just to give him a chance lying quickly so how the locket is back the flag is down the ball is picked up at the 31yard tackle is made there at the 27yard line <person player="tanner mcevoy" race="white" position="WR">tanner mcevoy</person> came in <person player="cassius marsh" race="white" position="DE">marsh</person> winds up with the football but it s all about the penalty now unbelievable your team has absolutely played their brains out and then you get a motion call here and essentially all you had to do probably for the rest of the game was plant the football as long as you dont lose the game on the offensive side or special teams you got to feel pretty good about what your defense is going to do and finally they probe riley it was a special teams play it was great defense and finally the arizona team finally gave him a chance and look at pete carroll <person player="tanner mcevoy" race="white" position="WR">mcevoy</person> rookie from wisconsin a free agent so she annalynne far in territory on the arizona half of the field four and a half ago he s a penalty i think mccauley said a penalty added to the end of the play he does that is a fiveyard penalty i get the call from the field in the second here it was at the 22 yard line so clearly within housekeys range they tacked on the illegal motion penalty is what they did george fan is now the left tackle and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> on playaction is gonna dump it off on the outside cook <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> and welcome to the moment well have picked up the first down however flag down back at the 33 holy edison it was <person player="brandon williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon williams</person> number 86 glossing the first down and mixing the first in 20 there we go right there <person player="tanner mcevoy" race="white" position="WR">tanner mcevoy</person> he really is just gonna run right through the block farren williams yeah rowan williams just could not hold up the first out of 20 at the 32yard line the illegal motion penalty was on pecola provo special finger and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> claire first covered by <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus cooper</person> second down and 20 you know it s just been that kind of game out here so far tonight you think about all the chances the arizona cardinals had they came down got a field goal when they were inside the 30yard line then a blocked field goal a sack at the end of the half and then lost it on down so theyve had plenty of opportunities all those field goals that were missed or not tried now are coming into play missed opportunities so many games come down second e20 well see fires over the middle yardline then incomplete <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> cant hold on hit by swear injure the third down and 20 where s our guy where s your right back here theyre going to do a little end cut were just going to come up and deliver the hit and that ball is out if they dont gain a yard here youre looking at 50 yard field goal attempt / attack with rice in the backyard well short of the first down that s mcavoy who blocked the kick so he s the big hero at the moment and now in comes <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> to attempt a field goal this has not been his favorite place he s made 12 of miss 7 in this stadium when 63% for a field goal kicker is bad this will be a 40yard attempt john lyon holds will increase to snap it and we are knotted up at three so four minutes remaining in regulation sitting down the stretch in lendale arizona three three with nfl game pass you can replay the games you mess with condense games in 45 minutes for the full broadcast versions suzanne offer nflcom slant in mass check it out today university of phoenix stadium which has already hosted two super bowls and vocal classics home of the cardinals and arizona will take the ball after the touch back at the 25 oh so many games come down to special teams then this one might as well as <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> heaping rocking the field goal attempt then you got <person player="tanner mcevoy" race="white" position="WR">mcevoy</person> coming in here the penalty to boot on arizona and a team that hadnt been passed its own 46 yard line is set up for the 40yard attempt by <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> who actually took a little bit of a divot sure he s where he knocked it down it s pretty good over the picturing lugs or in a wedge not necessarily good when youre a field goal kicker but he was able to bang it through seahawk since 2010 them 18 block kicks after he <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> and the co2 getting forward progress through jeremy lien with the coverage on the plague getting six yards on the gain itll be second down and no about four yards maybe this is when you start getting a little squirrely as a play call or you come out here and you basically if you had punted the football youd wonder if your defense would have just held up and won the game for you and now youve got to go back into the offensive mode but you know this defense kind of been kicking you a little bit too so you dont want to turn it over twice and lose the game based on their defense five as it turns out five and he gets taken down on a roll just having a fantastic night he s had a few in his career 8yard sack he has two and a half sacks tonight and it s third down at 13 just cant watch him use his hands here this guy is one of the best available and using his hands just gonna take <person player="dj humphries" race="nonwhite" position="OT">humphries</person> hands and just swat him down as he comes around and somehow <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> held on to that ball i have no idea that was roethlisberger asked holding on to that one but you cant lose the game by letting these guys come get you on the defensive side these are like sharks smelling blood 13:13 here they come on the blitz and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> steps away from traffic deeds first down from <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> up at the 38 yard line and thirteen on an end cut he picks up the first down <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> on the blitz almost gets the <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> steps away and picks up 16 yards biggest block of the night right there by <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> comes across the formation gets just enough of <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> to allow <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> to get that ball off and pick up the first down each <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> takes us to the twominute warning one three time outs of their disclosure three three on something to look coming up the volkswagen postgame report michelle as usual on the field with the stars of the game <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> and <person player="mike iupati" race="nonwhite" position="OG">mike</person> and tony well break it down and then well take a look ahead to next week s beauty in arlington between the eagles and the cowboys on sunday night football we are dropping <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> inside now is a pass rusher theyre gonna try and win this game with a sack bump well watch this side over here a lot of the 38yard line johnson get out of the backfield theyre gonna stop him behind the one in a scrimmage lost of a couple <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> with the tackle no time management now interesting on both sides both coaches probably want the clock to run a bit here but depending on the outcome of this play you may see one of the two sides taking a timeout give themselves a chance definitely this is the key right here on second and 12 <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> makes the catch he s out of bounds thatll stop the clock so not necessary to take a timeout here either side shed covering on the play now youve got a third down and two at the 46 yard line now were starting to see pending in april more and more stunts and games and loops and one of these two guys is going to come screaming after <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> here in a <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> but you got to feel like maybe this is <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> time here third and two <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> comes into the slot it gets short of the first down so it s fourth down four and two and carol now hell take a timeout he s gonna wind up getting the ball back boy <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">earl watford</person> allen that play completely missed watch this working against <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> biggest play of the night wiper goes right well never made contact <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> didnt end up making the stop but it was his disruption of <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> that created that play for <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> so seattle s gonna have one timeout this is quickly sixth but it s the 15th punt of the game not surprising when weve got six total points from the game and that s macavoy right there what do you need what weve already seen what he can do hit a good putt here you can start using arizona s timeouts to try and keep them back up now the good part again it s plotted the 22 lakh it did not call for the fair cats that s <person player="justin bethel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bethel</person> coming down and making the play on them so the ball is at the 22 we have 69 seconds one time out in arizona has all of its timeouts <person player="justin bethel" race="nonwhite" position="DB">bethel</person> was a great play by that that s a gutsy catch there with no fair catch by <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler lockett</person> to get away with that one that could have been game over he loses control that ball there we go though <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> weve seen him in this stadium and some clutch situations before weve seen both sides of that coin avidly all 223 lines up in the gun blank by working precise four man rush under tom the cloth locket makes the catch second down gain of knives you know the one thing i never liked playing in a game like this is you know you sort of feel like okay we can give them a couple underneath throws but what that does for the offense is it gives you confidence and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> they havent had a great night on offense you give them a couple of completions and all of a sudden they start feeling it out there and it picks up momentum on their side <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lockett</person> was able to get out of bounds the clock with 103 all without move the right side is to go to taiwan here they come and the pass is caught by curse and curses his own 40yard line up near midfield <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> you made a catch for the ages in that super bowl two years ago 17yard gain able to take advantage it was a big time blitz by arizona but both inside linebackers had a free run <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> came over and gave <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> just enough time but here it is how they a little confidence now going on the offensive side when it matters both up at the 48yard pressure put on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> gets away flag is thrown and he just slings that ball and if with a mix of <person player="corey peters" race="nonwhite" position="DT">corey peters</person> first through 13 accepted penalties in the game eight against seattle <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">garry gilliam</person> the right tackle against owls out of the game so george fans playing the left tackle spot rookie out of western kentucky right here youre gonna see the reach and the crab just because he doesnt know <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> get ready to reach the scramble out just that little grab easy to see by the officials on the other side george man panting <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jones</person> phaethon first and 20 back of the 38 the ocean the ball taken up to the 49 yard line another flag pose ice made the catch but barrels gonna watch the team polo go back even farther and that s fan youre a rookie at a western kentucky and youre looking right into the eyes and <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> good luck youre gonna get out here and then a loop back inside they call that a pick top because theyre just going to pick the tackle and allow <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> to come back inside and <person player="george fant" race="nonwhite" position="TE">fant</person> just grab them so this drive is there s more backwards offense in this game than forward offense up dives first and 30 41 seconds now if youre arizona you hold of me start burning all new start burning your time man i dont know if they can block the goal passing keep it on the ground and that s nothing so it s going to be second and 30 that s precise and arizona letting the clock one down really but yeah interested yeah but you know you stop it and then they complete a 40yard pass downfield thing you want to kill yourself i would rather take my chances with the timeout i think so to consent with it or at all three on the left tack it was second down and whatever thirty thousand feet or whatever yeah so i would have burned them all harrion s decides that he s going to take his chances next chance with the coin toss so it s the end of regulation might say regulation was underwhelming we know that at 33 there they are two to one ratio in both total yardage and time of possession i mean arizona has to be sick looking at these numbers double double you know that s a game you win by 20 points rushing is the three and a half times as much wow i mean give credit to the seattle defense it is so easy when youre playing on defense and your offense is doing nothing just sort of roll your eyes and not give up but you know more or less and get frustrated this defense kept hammering in the air ring and got it way this game is going there now maybe you kick off if you win the toss you single that time outs all replays will be alert the calista score wins unless it s the team that has the most positions for the field all the important will have the opportunity what s our fault come on what could the rookie backup quarterback gets the call with heads so arizona s going to get the ball you heard the rules suck seattle wins the game field goal or something short of that extends the game over sound we go on sunday night go to overtime again the standing seattle is four and one theyre looking for their fourth straight win arizona three and three some huge game in the division as we conclude week 7 houska to kickoff written golden and <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> for the cardinals that will bounce through the enzymes so have the ball at the 25yard line but you know the reason i think i would have burned those timeouts is i think pete carroll would have been forced to run the ball twice he could not pass protect he couldnt take a chance on a sack fumble in that situation so you would have at least forced the punt there now it s cooked something crazy have happened of course but i really thought pete carroll and darrell bevell had gotten to the point where they said you know what we just cant take a risk here on dropping back here and losing our quarterback and maybe losing the game on a sack bump magruder s go second in authority ariane s decides to go for overtime wins the toss johnson up to the 30yard line i mean it s such a weird game in so many ways we come out here tonight maybe it would be a defensive struggle but youre not thinking about three three no not between these two teams course their defenses are very good but you just wonder now this seattle defense has been on the field for so long do you just turn around and keep giving at the <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> at this point and wonder cant we just are they finally to that point yet where maybe theyre ready to give up some long run here so johnson tonight as long as one is 14 yards but he s gained 101 28 carries leaving the lingam yards from scrimmage they thank it to him outside snelson he spun away got a couple more yards and has it at the 50yard line tackle thereby shed they brought <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> down in a blocking formation to make it look like run all the way and then <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> speed on the outside he was left oneonone because seattle is forced to come up and play the run against <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> so they go hard playaction he s one on one on the outside against maybe the fastest guy in the national football league had to give him all that space right at the midfield strength nothing bosses the line of scrimmage or gets there <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony mcdaniel</person> right there for the tackle itll be second down and ten take a look down the line here <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> that s bruce arians was all over the fact that he thinks <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> is also ive got everyone three receivers to the right side bomber looking the other traffic in that <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> is the intended receiver and right was there so third and 10 dont you just get the feeling that some defensive play is gonna win this game just the more you watch it it s like every time somebody throws the ball you kind of hold your breath but the played and <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> was a huge play even if they have to punt the football because what it did was it brought it to midfield so now if you punt you have a chance to pin them back and really put pressure on seattle s offense to have to play backed up which they engage all night long except the one time when i got the blocked kick and turned that into a field goal and now seattle takes a timeout you only get two and over to apple so theyre down to their final one before the third down and ten you know bruce arians has the guts of a sailor right he s he s gonna throw it in any circumstance at any time anywhere that he s also seen what <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> and <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april and some of those guys have been able to do to his outside protectors so for <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> tonight to 38 <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> has said very few days or nights like this one in his career on the ground <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> s only carried the ball twice tonight 42 if i were to throw the ball here i would want this one out of my third and ten it is flowing for an 18yard gain to the 32 yard line so a huge stirred down conversion first down to the 32 straight zone defense and what a throw by <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> here he s going to split the gap between the two underneath coverages that s not <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> s responsibility and the guy that have been struggling to catch the ball this year <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> makes a great catch in a clutch situation pick up 5 hardearned yards he gets to the 27 he s closing in on the rushing lead right now ezekiel <person player="deandre elliott" race="UNK" position="DB">elliott</person> of dallas i believe would still be in front but not by much this is like a repeat of when we were here for the new england game right opening nance to come down and win it with a field goal and bruce arians would rather try and score a touchdown then try another field goal oh yeah field goal extends the game seattle would have one opportunity a touchdown and wins the game this was the case in the green bay playoff game we did last year and arizona takes a timeout timeout arizona so each team one timeout were gonna see next sunday night philadelphia dallas rookie as he killed elion lead in rushing you got the rookie dak prescott who s the great <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson</person> wentz and the eagles that eagle defense today was tremendous as they knock dog minnesota five and one with the cowboy sworn to of the eagles got a few story lines and that went washington losing today the detroit and giant london beat the rams so four and three everybody above 500 in the nf seized let your toxins pass rushers over there in philadelphia gets maybe the best offensive line in football at the dallas cowboys there johnson rana 30 yards behind <person player="deandre elliott" race="UNK" position="DB">elliott</person> for the rushing lead in the try to win it in get up intended for <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> and that shed coloring on the play going for the win and said it s third down and five what an unbelievable play by shed to not have a pass interference watch how patient he is he does not interfere with that play i thought for sure when that ball was underthrown that he was going to get pass interference and ball on the 1yard line that was tremendous i mean that was tremendous now <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> could have jumped back through them and maybe drawn that flag but great patience thirtyfive brother twentyseven with protectionist eyebrows and it s not caught by <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">floyd</person> he was there we would have had the first down instead he gonna bring in <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> for an attempt of about 45 yards makes it great catch in his hands let this one hit him right in the shoulder pads there s nothing wrong with using your pads to help you make a catch but youve got to put your hands on it at the same time it hits your pads now we got to watch <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> game will go on even with a field goal <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> from 45 high drama again on a kick and this time the kick by <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> is good so it is 6 to 3 in seattle will now get one possession bring it a hand into overtime six three six to three <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> the waiting his turn title lock it back to receive seattle gets one possession they dont score it that s it you get a feel going we go on you get a touchdown they win the game thatll lock it bob a little bit my injuries this season but he is explosive <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> an opportunity to run it back so <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> and company come out to the 25yard line there s arizona s defense theyre getting ready know one thing about overtime you look at the seattle guys that d on the trampoline everything is poured down territory now so even if it s whatever it is fourth down youre going for it there s nothing to lose and that is the situation back up rookie left tackling the game george fan brookey right guard jermaine a fetty and defensively now your plan receivers because you are confident with seattle s offensive line and they give it to michael and <person player="christine michael" race="UNK" position="RB">christine michael</person> takes it out to the 35 so a nice way to start comes off the backside <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">graham</person> lays down a nice block and that s a gain of ten and a first down tight ends getting it done here <person player="brandon williams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon williams</person> first block there and then <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> s going to come around and clean up the backside of that with a nice it as well so feels good when youre struggling with pass protection to the 10yard run to start those yeah their longest rush of the night from the 35 by <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> who had a changeup to him jefferson makes the tackle and that s another first down i think this is one of the better throws that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> makes when he is on the move he has this innate ability to sort of lob throws out there ive seen him do that on multiple occasions even running directly towards the line of scrimmage and drop it in over the top of a defender not many people can do that perfect touch gain of 13 at the 48yard line stepping up fires over the middle and that s a gain of about seven that s gram again making the catch it s going to be second down and three <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> but the heat on but couldnt get to him very nice place to start this drive now that the pressure is getting there almost instantaneously but now weve seen in the last couple of plays <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> bootleg out right now step up and through the pocket he s starting to give them in a little <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> move here and of eight second and two and going through the hole goes michael taking the ball to the 38 yard line were just about on the edge of field goal range here right there the doubleteam there is what set that one up the augsburg in a perfect time full place for their quest drive of the night what adds confidence when you get that extra down on the 38 this is <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">graham</person> some overtime period to the 23 yard line that s a gain of 15 not only did he do that he also helped them protection watch this knocked down <person player="josh mauro" race="white" position="DE">josh mauro</person> then go pick up the first down you know that s the reason you pay superstar players like that and it s really an effective thing to start working those quick throws over the middle now to <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> who had kind of been lost in this game at the 24 the line of scrimmage marcus golden so now youre in territory get the fourth im gonna hear a field over where that marcus golden is just relentless a im really happy to see guys that work as hard as he does and practice every day all the extra stuff that he does they have such great respect for him now starting to get the results of the sacks that he deserves second and nine from the 23 whoa man watch that that was good again for yard line that s locket making the cash and that will make it third down and four well this is one of those times that ordinarily youd say all right <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> on the edge of bootleg quarterback draw all the things that come into play and do they now or not i think <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> is option one for being here he is going to be flanked out down here to the bottom right wide to the right bottom of the screen third down and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> in complete stopping was <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">graham</person> <person player="tony jefferson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tony jefferson</person> was back there now it s fourth now so house good comes in to attempt a field goal and this would be about 36 yards i have no idea what <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> did there you know he s like he did not anticipate that one at all last one he took a divot and still got it through not his favorite place to kick from 36 yards to keep the game going at each team with a field goal in the next score will win the game it is six six was 642 left in the overtime period so now we are in suddendeath overtime next score wins the game game can end in the wreck of the season in a tie very infrequently does that happen the last one was two years ago the bengals and carolina wound up in a 37 37 tie and there were a few players that didnt know that it could end in a tie now do you really want to call donovan out on that no okay you just did he wasnt the only one correct zoe wasnt admitted it now scott to kick off he got written golden and <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> both back at the goal hospice kick yards in taking the lead is <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> will get the ball at the 25 little recap of the game tonight all defense with <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> with a hundred and sixtyfour yards from scrimmage he already lit the lead in that department <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> he s had better nights with nice drive their special teams of course you to block kicks for the seahawks first one into their first score of the night damon 36 yard field goal in overtime to extend the action run the 25 playaction 250 euro it s funny mama who made the first catch of his career in regulation and the old guys second year guy at a boston college team of the practice one in week four 26 yard game you could see <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> at the top running the post route which drew <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> just enough out of that area to allow <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> to fire this one in there and it s not always big arm throwers are needed in the national football league but that was one of those throws were lay it in there perfect were getting to tease the play because bells we yard gain here for <person player="david johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">david johnson</person> to the 45 yard line where you can only imagine how exhausted this seattle defense has to be i mean they have been out there a lifetime in this game and have not folded yet they just keep hanging in there and this is a defense that has a way of making plays in these moments to win football theyve defended 84 plays and theyve been on the field for over 40 minutes old thomas <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> some of these guys have a knack second and seven <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> great protect is incomplete intended for <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> everybody wants a flag everybody rudy for the cardinals of course but theyre not going to get 1/3 down stars going at it right there im gonna push by <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> ball overthrown no call that was the correct one so third and seven five receivers a bunch to the left three the pair to the right blitz coming karma hanging in fighters over the middle notion to the 5yard line <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> they almost got to him and <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> takes the boiler first and goal 40 yards right ere is going to come up and run the end cut and it s <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> who just loses his footing and cant come back to make the tackle ill tell you <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jj nelson</person> has made some big plays in this game stepping up <person player="john brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">john brown</person> unable to go <person player="michael floyd" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael floyd</person> missed the key pass and he s get some love on that sideline now so maybe you run a play or whatever where <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> takes the ball or whatever hash mark <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> feels more comfortable with hell go wins the game and play clock was it one took on that one final time to get down there take a timeout when do you kick it right now you know ordinarily but bruce arians i mean how long did he talk with us about this yet what has happened to his bugle teams and and how it s hurt him this year and how they could be undefeated and all those sorts of things take a look at again at <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> almost getting sacked there s notion working on <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> now the weird thing was <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> was all over that route he almost broke before <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> did and just stumbled a bit and he is the famous dancer druce then we saw him in seattle last year when <person player="andre ellington" race="UNK" position="RB">ellington</person> ran for a gamewinning touchdown with that fabled dance and now you line up at a first and goal from the fire the johnson and he s gonna hate to the end zone but theyre going to say he s just before he gets to the goal line not the pylon off its warring second down and goal the <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> came out of nowhere to push him out of bounds that s interesting he does extend that ball and never come right up to the line and they give it to johnson waggener stop snow at the half yard line one more look you cant challenge it s everything is reviewable in new york if they want to stop it but they didnt and now do you bring in the field i think you bring them in here i mean at this point assume that was that was close i think once that foot hit the pylon no but you know you just kinda you got a look at bruce arians how did you know he s watching this with half his eyes closed here and well that s why he has a new snapper the play clock is to zero so that s gonna cost them five for eight the way blendin offense fiveyard penalty they got it right here so he has a new snapper than a new holder who got <person player="aaron brewer" race="white" position="LB">aaron brewer</person>s snapping picked him up <person player="ryan quigley" race="white" position="P">ryan quigley</person> came in to punt is the holder so these are different guys than had the problems in the new england game on opening day in the buffalo game <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> right in the middle same thing he s going to be trying to jump over the top one of those guards need to reach up with their hands and make some contact with it it s no good how in a movie that s a reason and españa it has been a nightmare it has been a nightmare for this thing there comes <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> right over the top and some pressure off the side was that <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> coming around the edge he thinks he s won the game oh yes wow cant make this stuff up back her up over the top and he made contact again it must have been incidental so now the ball is at the 20yard line i just got it kristen michael picks up one arizona doesnt have a timeout my understanding of the role which is clearly wrong is if you jump over and you make contact if you jump cleanly youre fine but theyre got <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">earl watford</person> putting his arm up and making contact so maybe i dont know by the way if youre thinking seattle can run or not and settle for the tie which would be so beneficial then there is a twominute warning in overtime they play this like a fourth quarter so the clock will stop second and nine it s made up at the 26yard line that s <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> now you got a third down they can take it down to the twominute warning this <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> does he get another opportunity down the line he said they stopped him here theyre gonna get the ball back ill tell you what a guy that is a big hero right now is kelsey mcrae he s the guy that chased from behind and got <person player="jj nelson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nelson</person> at the 5yard line there s something going on in the end zone at the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> had missed the tackle and the fact that there was no touchdown on the reach for the pylon and <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> has played so third down and four the <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">clark</person> is going to stop at two minutes right there a two minute overtime warning not sure the players necessarily knew what the situation was here layin alive third and four we come back so two minutes seattle would have a timeout arizona does not go back to the <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> play again and the missed field goal well by the time <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">watford</person> reached his arm up that was <person player="earl watford" race="UNK" position="OG">watford</person> initiating the contact so he did not hit the center did not land on the center shirt allow <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> laid out couldnt get to it third and four existing play call here incomplete pass news arizona a lot of time after a fun <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> my purse covered by <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus cooper</person> on a third and four gutsy gutsy call because they brought all the pressure watch all this stuff coming in here and this offensive line all night long has been tough perfectly picked up that time get the oneonone on the outside against <person player="marcus cooper" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cooper</person> speaking the guy make some big plays in this place <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> it s made of udo levy 31 yard gain michael get them very close to field goal range before he is taken out of bounds clock stopped 147 gain of six this is a pete carroll kind of football game isnt it i bet you he said 50 times on that sideline tonight dont give up guys were gonna make a play special teams defense somebody s going to make a play were gonna win this game i promise you said theyre going were gonna win this game i promise youre gonna win it now they bring the rookie <person player="alex collins" race="UNK" position="RB">alex collins</person> into the backfield on second down and four and they give it the columns it s a yard maybe a yard in advance so right now you are looking at about a 55 yard field goal attempt if they dont gain another yard russel <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> was telling us that sometimes he goes over the sidelines and the toughness of moments and he and pete carroll look at each other and go unloved this i love being in this situation can you believe we get to do this how much fun is this and here they are again and im a lot of fun right now on the arizona bench it s third down and three at the 36 block one and down to a minute left in overtime sensation badge and hates the world inside the ten broke away from time matthew and now weve got a first and goal and of course big news to be coming in matthieu no question one of the better slot guys has been struggling with that knee injury clearly not himself just yet oh boy worse than gold <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">catanzaro</person> opening night disaster the middle goes kristen michael this would be about as bad a loss as a team could suffer if your arizona to have your defense play the way they played tonight and and to be in a chance to get a half game out instead of two and a half out and losing head to head and also before you hit me up right there you had that five yard delay of game penalty so now haschke comes in to try to win the game 28 yard attempt john ryung into hole that is impossible im telling you there s something inside his brain about this building whoo oh my goodness gracious that could not have happened you know what maybe this is justice for all concern oh man i guess if a game deserves to wind up in a tie this is the one <person player="brian dixon" race="UNK" position="DB">brian</person> push it down house kurt just close it im just telling you and weve watched this al every kick that <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> is made tonight he has gone up and fooled around with the turf and felt uncomfortable i dont know if he stuck his foot in the ground that first field goal barely cleared he kind of chunked that one a little bit and maybe the happiest guy in the building right now <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">chandler catanzaro</person> oh my goodness and <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> washington <person player="patrick peterson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peterson</person> watching ball at the 20yard line sophia settle to the tie or do you air one out here and hope for a pass interference penalty that would extend the game you got three receivers and a bunch to the right be careful you dont get one picked off but all its lyman back there examine attack where do you run the stampers play here here s <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> he gets out of bounds and he there s two seconds left on the clock so youre on a fivesecond play and he got one more opportunity defensive foul would extend the game even though theyd be no time just be careful with a guy like <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">larry fitzgerald</person> going down the field he can make it look like a pass interference when it s not a pass interference and a little acting on his part here dont be stunned you gutsy call by any official to call pass interference here who knows who knows does your alltime prevent defense threeman rush he s going to air one a bomb and incomplete <person player="larry fitzgerald" race="nonwhite" position="WR">fitzgerald</person> ii intended man in the end zone and that s the way it will ends chip shot field goal attempts that could have won the game hon so these guys go 75 minutes neither sees the endzone that s going to make this whole race in the nfc and the nfc west in particular a little crazy when you throw that tie in that nobody figures youll have so the cardinals are three three and one and seattle is 4 1 and 1 and 0 missing this one how skirmishing his it winds up 6 section ot we will have the volkswagen postgame report
