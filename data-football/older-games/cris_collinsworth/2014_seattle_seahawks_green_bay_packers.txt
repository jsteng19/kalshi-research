national anthem republic records recording artist ariana grande oh myself to plan time to take those earplugs out it s all yours michelle the packers visited seattle the game ended with that fail marry that controversial touchdown pole which gave the seahawks the win but often gets forgotten is the rogers was sacked eight times in that game all in the first now rogers told me those sacks were a product of trying to throw a lot of passes early and of course the noise mike mccarthy said i didnt give this place enough credit we tried to spread them out it s not a half now rogers believes they have a much better plan tonight theyre going to try to run as fast as possible and he wants to go require a lot of adjustment of the line of scrimmage but still theyre raising the number one defense in the nfl and their starting center is a rookie cornelius who didnt take any snaps with the starters in the preseason and then there s the 12th man the tradition here the three honorary flag raisers steve largent cortez kennedy the hall of fame and they are the three seattle seahawks whose numbers have been retired as a franchise in its 39th just recently in and pam this stadium as almost

beast mode <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> for the 43yard line maybe third and one so <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> a thirdround pick two years ago twenty four and eight as a starting quarterback regular season of course last year took them all the way to the title with three postseason wins started his comments career at north carolina state still had eligibility there but they werent interested in having him come back through his senior year so on he went to wisconsin led unto the rose bowl and of course the hawks to the super bowl last year marvin takes the quick flip and picks up the first down at the 48 yard line <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> makes the tackle <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> with two touches already he had two rushes in the superbowl and ended up the leading rusher in that game that anytime you get this dynamic playmaker in the open field you do running back dom capers was telling me when he was with the minnesota vikings that they feared him as much in the backfield as they did adrian peterson that s the kind of talent he has he ran back that second half kickoff to make the score 29th or nothing in the super bowl and that was the kills drive nash over the middle caught by <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> who also had a good postseason gain of eight let s take a look at the packer defense dates on jones ucla with troy going on refa high school tornadoes <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> hanno regional high school <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> usc a jayhawk the ohio state university <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> university of colorado julia s purpose north carolina trauma wouldnt lottie more than bernie georgia team <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hide the university of iowa sam sill the youth and if you didnt pay much attention in the offseason this that is <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> the former carolina panther and chicago bears his turban he s gets taken down they put turban in the backfield thinking <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> out here and he gets taken down by matthews from though game you better get somebody on this guy you leave him on block he s gonna run down your running back from behind the plate <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> had real problems with his thumb had surgery in the offseason and if you can imagine for a pass rushing defender kind of grab and pull with that that really limits you right off the bat we see something explosiveness back so her his first play of the season taking turbine down from the nine <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> comes back in now <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> from the gun on third the two in the passes deflected in the air and then intercepted and then it s loose again are they got a corner an interception no it s been a quota an incompletion jones came down with the ball but theyre going to say incomplete what a great play i think that was <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> who went up and knocked it out watch this it comes back this is going to be an easy interception <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> gets back on his feet and knocks that ball out tremendous play <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> says thank you very much great play by <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> initially but then <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> saved him an interception so seattle s first punt off the foot of john ryan rayville <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> back to run it back standing at the 8 yard line nose down with backspin and as a short kick and you got a flag down into the kicker as a flag is gone by <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">perry</person> <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> came in to try the pond ryan s dick the ticker but since it was fourth in school that finds enough for a first down right up the gut this was an easy call comes right in catches them tries to catch them on the way down but it doesnt do you any good and one thing you do not need to do with seattle is give them extra opportunities that hurts like daniel is a really good player out he is a talented guy when the strongest guys youll see playing defensive end around but that was a big mistake <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> now from a shotgun at the 40yard line as the seattle s open and drive and they give it the carbon and hartman gets the first down and picks up a gain of first while faye zack <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> block the muffins been huge on this drive first down look familiar here comes the jet sweep across the way here and before the defense you see <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> been around the league about 10 12 years he couldnt even figure out what just happened to him but first he hardly went by him so fast this isnt play they ran it twice and a super bowl for forty five yards and still working marvin he came over in that crave last year but missed almost the whole season hip surgery offensive coordinator down bevel had him at minnesota he calls the plays play clock is down to one and they just do snap it feeling the pressure watch the takeoff hips to the side wanna know game haha clinton dicks runs him out of bounds i see clinton about that and that a great name is you just wonder if he told a joke what would you do you know i dont know but he is a young man that he s a safety that has come over he s going to sort of mix his way in with <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah hyde</person> who s a little bit more of a cover kind of guy haha clinton dicks is a is a bigger guy that maybe if <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> gets it going to see more of him halfway mark of the opening quarter on open a night with no score second and ten puts that head down and takes the ball through 21 yard line the means to see how much <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> carries the ball this year he s had more than 300 carries in each of the last two seasons he s not 28 years old watch the young rookie right tackle justin brett on the backside get the veteran <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> on the ground and if you can do that with the way that <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> can hit some cutbacks end up with some big runs a lot of pressure on <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> very good run blocker well see how he holds up against these excellent pass rushers second round pick that no time on missouri high school heavyweight wrestling champion third down and five from the 21 yard line what s coming listen get to the way the pass is caught but not enough to the first down as <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> had to come back to make the catch and forward progress wont met him the first ramon williams is there for the stop doing a lot of things already with <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay</person> math he was going to stunt inside here and almost get there but <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s doing such a great job of getting the ball out of his hands and there s the young rookie on the outside against <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> pretty good down that way so fourth and one is born win had to come back to make the catch and williams to make sure he didnt picked up the first this will be a 35yard field goal attempt for <person player="steven terrell" race="UNK" position="DB">steven</person> houska and what do we have here weve got a timeout they almost got with too many men on the field if they had been caught there theyve been able to get that snap off it would have been first down again 30 second time almost two huge penalties or mistakes on special teams to start this game carroll contending that they didnt get the timeout called <person player="josh boyd" race="UNK" position="DE">josh boyd</person> was one of the guys with about 13 guys on the field right now and so they figure it out and start to run off but seattle obviously they may have tried to get this snap off and if they had it would have been a first down <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> was the other guy to account for the 13 so haschke now will reset at the 25yard line trying to put up the first points of this season john ryan who s the punter will do the holding <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> inside there tick blockers ever for many years and this kick is perfect soon as your first score of the season 603 left in the first seattle three in green bay nothing they dont miss a moment of sunday night football this season with nbc sports live extra take the game with you anywhere online and tablet great shot of seattle and the ferris wheel it s open a couple years ago <person player="jayrone elliott" race="UNK" position="LB">elliott</person> bay look at downtown seattle home ill say it always is but of course when you come home as the super bowl champion extra special obviously you see the <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> cool and in the end zone by <person player="dujuan harris" race="UNK" position="RB">harris</person> the family aside of course is the space needle here in seattle found out about a week ago he was going to be the starter in this man well goldman zone power here coming off the doubleteam biting lated ohio state he played in the big <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> what a way to make you dave nice opening salvo for <person player="corey linsley" race="white" position="C">linsley</person> a kid from youngstown ohio and he snaps it to roger s on first down and the pants to the outside has taken there by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> lindsley grow up near cleveland but he wasnt a browns fan he said i was a packer fan in fact he was such a packer fan when he was seven years old for halloween he dressed up as brett favre i asked him last night bezerra knowing this he said no i said he will not seem overwhelmed from the 31 raju is throwing and it s <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> trying to break a and he gets a lot of help and he gets gang technical let s take a look at the seattle defense <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> 80 taylor high school tournament game tennessee brennan me bein krish is go <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person> boilermaker <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">malcolm smith</person> usc <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> d utah state <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right mississippi state <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> stamp cam chester virginia tech boro thomas vbu texas designer <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> cc blaine look at those numbers theyre right up there with the 1985 chicago bears he was points most takeaways phenomena on every level blakelock to zero as rogers gets it away the traffic and it s incomplete rainbow table covered on the play by german lane simple little pick play bob coming up the sideline he hesitated just a minute with this entire game so far <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> third and 14 sliding left rogers buys a ton of time and then that pace is underthrown often tended for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> fourth and 14 and they get a little skirmish going on back at the 15yard line becomes a roll off the corner here and teach aint laying coming from the backside the guard just took april out that has become very much in vogue in the national and here s <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> going to do something new this year where s patman tara was three yards hold and take no longer detroit for one back the air for the second time in the game miss pants underneath it and then loses the football as he did not call for the fair catch the packers assured they have it and will wait for the call here from the crew they have it so thomas running back kicks and <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> was right there all over and im surprised thomas didnt call for the fair kasia too costly yeah the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> blocked <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> right into the kick returner <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> and <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> now that s two times in a row he took a huge chance just trying to field the punt you know the kind of pride he has he is a guy that wants to be the tough guy out there but that s twice now he took huge chances not calling a fair catch in this time in boston aha clinton dick s wound up with the recovery and that gives green bay excellent position at the 34 yard seattle up three nothing lacey and in the back view of cleaning the floor back and lacey follows and then goes to the outside but he cant turn the corner that s the andal with officious marché and working out of new cla in on the tackle okay one thing youre going to learn about the national football league is theyre going to play you inside out they want you to truck it out one nfl defensive ends aligned unless youre gale sayers second and ten three backs now i think wireless is also in the bathroom and there s nothing happening there to the 32 yard line <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> makes us not laci pick in the second round play for saving as alabama last year green bay looking for the running game had a confession early in the season they also added loft week but then when rogers got hurt they had to go to the ground games and he got a lot of experience in 2000 the first time really third in a roger slides the rules and the pass is taken in by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> does he have the first down it s right there on the yellow line theyre gonna spot it and it should move the changement does <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> just so good moving to his left it s such a tough throw drills it right in there but that ability just like <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> has that just slide out of the pocket by a little at two quarterbacks tonight we were both great outside of the pocket and that baños of the popliteal were just great this is notion and hell make it burst down and goal for green bay <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron maxwell</person> came at the end of last year and played really well but because seattle does not flipflop their quarterbacks theyre able to get their best receiver <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> on fire and <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> any they want it and basically <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> s on the other side again <person player="jarrett boykin" race="UNK" position="WR">jarrett boykin</person> their number now they stack the backs here rogers have taken it out of the shotgun fakes the hand off this is <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> stretching for the goal line and he s out of bounds uppity backhoe by <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> and this game plan has not been too complex so far max flow comes up they go to that back shoulder or come back he plays off a little bit they just raise up and let <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> try to make a play second down and goal oh hurry up here the play clock is that two and rogers takes the time out so he surveyed the situation green bay coming into the game a lot of talk about they wanted to run 75 plays per game they did that in one of their in the first half anyway on that pace in a preseason game chris and tonight theyve run 14 plays in almost a full quarter yeah and the difference is that the defensive lineman for the seattle seahawks last season they played about 65 percent of the snaps that s what they sort of averaged even on the top end of that so theyre trying to make them stay on the field for an entire drive and wear them down rogers had that broken collarbone last year in midseason did comeback blading in chicago in a last game of the year led that tremendous comeback at the finish at soldier field got him into the playoffs they have in san francisco but lost in the wildcard round defence s forget about john coon touchdown catching the football now they have <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> in the backfield so they put the tackle in there there he is coon and he reaches out and his into the touchdown line jets coming in to say he was able to stretch out before forward progress was stopped and in go the packers we just think that he s gonna hand the ball to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> the other way let s make sure he crossed the plain here yes i dont think he was ever down as knee was never down i guess they never blew the whistle from momentum and then clearly leaned it across the line while scoring plays automatically reviewed yep he s across the line and he part of the ball over any part of the goal line that s 21 regularseason touchdowns now for that man who none of them longer than 10 yards but that s what he does comes in in short yardage and does it here so far special teams mistakes leading to both schools <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> or the extra point so what set it up it was the muck punch thomas put it on the ground and the backers take it in for the first touchdown of the season 7 3 3 today well mike holmgren was here for a long time and there s a guy of course who was on both sides in this game green bay took them to a super bowl had a street named after him took seattle to a super bowl in detroit against pittsburgh after the old five season which they lost 21 to 10 and the kickoff goes through the end zone so seattle will get the ball 125 to go in the corner with green bay up 54 on opening night well that s a nice pair to draw to <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> coming over from chicago play matthews drafted a few years ago by green bay take a look at some of those numbers eight pro balls for <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> for four mathies would have made it a 5th appearance probably heading that had the broken thumb on two occasions last year and that deep bench is on the field right now as the ball is heaved at all <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> for a gain of a couple and theyre going to hold against seattle now <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> is saying it s on <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> the rookie immediately snapped around offense the 68 can hear kennedy first out is right here gonna kind of hook him around the neck shoulder area and got the call one thing that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s done a nice job of at least so far he s getting the ball out of his hands really quickly dom capers the defensive coordinator now feels like he has more healthy pass rushes that he s had in years and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> knew it he knew he s gonna have to good fought of his hand we havent seen any of his sort of trademark scrambles out there first out in 20 now i guess she breathed that as it takes you to the 20 gain of 11 matthews runs him down there itll be second down one of the real pleasant surprises so far this preseason has been to play these two guards <person player="jr sweezy" race="UNK" position="DT">jr sweezy</person> and <person player="james carpenter" race="nonwhite" position="OG">james carpenter</person> <person player="james carpenter" race="nonwhite" position="OG">james carpenter</person> on the other side the guy that maybe wasnt always in the best of shape came back and just great shape number 77 and they feel like that he is really has a chance to be a star in this game the <person player="jr sweezy" race="UNK" position="DT">jr sweezy</person> penetrate as well they can shot handoff from mckenzie s maybe arent sila first found by <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> before he goes out of bounds so theyve turned a first and 20 into a third down and one as the clock will tick down and probably end the quarter before they get another playoff you know sometimes as a quarterback getting out of the pocket just kind of get you in the game and somebody with the mobility of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> i think thatll help him here early and that is the end of the first quarter green bay 7 seattle 3 this kickoff special resumes from seattle after these messages and tonight s aerial coverage being brought to you by geico start the second quarter in seattle al michaels cris collinsworth and michele tafoya on a beautiful opening night it s third down and one now for the seahawks from their own 29 yard line he will pick up the first down running them down id say a marsha she s just so good he breaks more tackles and anybody that i can name in the national football league and you think youve got him he s not a huge guy about 215 220 pounds but one guy trying to get him it just doesnt happen <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> crashed down across the face and that was <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> able to just ride him right out a hole to the outside to <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> smack before he can get to the line of scrimmage in the ball almost came loose there clean matthews is right there to secure like <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> is playing angry out here so far looked like he tried to rip the head off of <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> on this one come out here he reads this all the way quickly gets off the block and just gets brushed cochran by the head play matthews say what allen he s right and when he s healthy he has been as dynamic a defensive players we have in the game it just always a shame it seems like something kind of knocks him out of his damn <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> that pedigree by the way yeah wide open at the 50yard line is <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harvin</person> and on second and long <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy</person> harmon takes them all into green bay territory they spotted in about the 32 what a move off the ball by <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> he s going to come over and duck underneath the coverage here make <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> basically get picked off his own guy and perfectly done by <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> those crossing routes are just something that are going to give the packers nightmare here s <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> the tight end on the outside boy is it nice to have a tight end that can block a superstar passion elijah like that already five catches tonight for harper they fake it to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> they think everybody rocket makes the tax pitch into the end zone beautiful they took finland they took a page out of words play bar the read option pull up and down the field the corner came up to get <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and he just dumped it right in behind him <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> thought that was just the read option so he was going after <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> pulls it down and throws a touchdown pass great play design and clinton dicks misses the tackle gonna stop that about the five they take the lead <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> go to kick the extra point the second quarter the seahawks backtoback 33yard plays a <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harvin</person> reception the locket reception and dress like that seattle takes the lead over greenberg 10 to 7 well that drive started with a penalty on <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">britt</person> they started at the 20 the <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">britt</person> penalty took them back to the 10 and away they went it s an 80yard drive two runs four passes the backtoback 33 yarders the marvin and walk it and seattle has the lead for the first time ten to seven seahawks on top nature s to get back out onto the field he has begun the night six out of eight for 34 yards paris hesitated and then comes out and gets the ball to the 16 yard line as we go back to the touchdown <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> hadnt seen this one see the read option he comes up and there s nobody in behind but haha clinton dicks here he comes a little changeup that s a play they use a lot in college now welcome to the nfl usually done by in my favorite part nice people kids theyre kind of laughing the best you can read his lips level one of the top officials in the league might have got head coaches off had they not go got so deep into the playoffs less from the 16 and <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> get stuff and then it s so tough for an assistant coach to have a chance because that the team needs the coach they normally want to hire him chris in january they dont want to have to wait around so youve got bevel youve got dan quinn the defensive coordinator the pair of guys who might be head coaches right now were not for the success of the seahawks now both the coordinators had two interviews of piece but they could wait you know there s too much pressure to hire a coach and rogers will dump it off the lazy he would snack at the 20yard line you off the green bay you know we talk about coaches and you think about them and youve got lambo of course and lombardi and we saw mike holmgren and this guy he doesnt get what he deserves mike mccarthy nine years my pretty w yeah and really he s since the head coach believes the office look at their offensive numbers offthecharts theyve had a couple of lead in the history of the league he is the second highest points per game average top only white third and five and a quick toss on a slant and a first down his pop makes the catch lane rolls and down and that moves the chains but <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person>s had groin injuries and you just wonder how healthy is going to be on he s changed trypsin he thought it was going to be that pic play again he reacted to the outside and they just changed it up and at the <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> passes away picked up of two or three <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> the middle linebacker stockton we had two packers down on that play yeah you got malaga and you got <person player="richard rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="TE">richard rodgers</person> so you get your right tackle and your tight end so a pair of packers are down to needing attention saturday night one of college football s grade rivalries notre dame in michigan you can warm up for it on nbcsn at 6:30 eastern and then the game at 7:30 eastern you had rogers and waga both going down on the same flavor paper look at how it happened malaga s head right back into rich i think blog pushing like symptoms for what happened that sharad number 78 there it s our fourth year a mississippi state starts and he gets taken down after a very short game by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> got a little taste of that park tackling that they talk about this team does about as good a job of take great pride and third down and four pretty tough to run with offense at warp speed in this ballpark bleh clock at four handoff goes to starts and he takes it after the 44 yard line and so the backup back youve got lacey of course is number one but starts can do the job found out about that was super bowl a few years ago and the one <person player="dujuan harris" race="UNK" position="RB">harris</person> is number three and he had a great year last year five and a half more three touchdowns over 2000 raja s protected well and that s parlous making the catch out of bounce he goes camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> with the tackle <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> he s not as good as it gets right now because weve lived in this whole brady and peyton manning era and theyre still great but he came along a little bit late if it was right up there with him there s no question about it seperates in a little you can phone left or right or in the pond i feel cool breeze in there as well second down and eight and it starts it s taken down gang again everybody going to the ball third down and five today you have to start going <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and there s first two years in the league dont forget angela see him on sunday night indianapolis against denver thirtyfive rogers escaping buying time beep that field into traffic and two flags im trying to turn around yet <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> going all the way down filled with him and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> getting tangled up with him and to flex come in pretty amazing the <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> could run that far down the field with a guy like <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> but once that ball is near its defense 154 on a minute first now so difficult for anybody to learn to turn their head and middle line arent used to doing this when the ball is coming got it your head or just the receivers action of going back into the defender is an automatic pass interference that s a 44 yard penalty first and goal from the and the outside this comet is going to wrap up menial by lane at that play where <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> never turned around to look for the pass he simply was going to block coming off the line of scrimmage theyre going to try and get it here and just huh under 8 to go on a half she watched by three threatening with a second and goal only see if the legs going takes the ball just inside the 5yard line third and goal correct me if im wrong but i think every single staff garrison s been on rich side <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> buying time intended for <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> and thatll make a fourth down yeah it s a good thing that <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> to it where he did or <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> is gonna have an interception rodgers saw him and was hoping <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> would slide away from him but i dont think <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> ever saw what burrell thomas was doing so they cant cash all the way in on that 44 yard penalty has settled for a field goal attempt <person player="mason crosby" race="white" position="K">mason crosby</person> had a nice comeback year last for season in 2012 and this 23yard attempt is good that drive which ends with three instead of seven and the game tied at ten <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> can do it from outside the pocket his two years in the league 1821 yards and 17 td passes that s the most of the nfl outside the pocket and inside the pocket aint bad either and only two quarterbacks for the 100 plus rating inside and outside the pocket over the past two seasons and the other is a guy were going to see on sunday night the incredibly mobile peyton manning yeah yeah that was one as soon as that one came up i was like say wait a minute who is that he just is good everywhere i go home and wrote to at the goal line <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> look into some room i was able to run a factor in the 30yard line what a difference he s going to make this season player there s this guy <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> one of the things he fully worked on is quickening up his release time 033 is about as good as it gets weve seen a couple down around point three oh he s been pretty consistent at point three three youll see this rolling motion pretty much straight up maybe a little loop at the bottom but he gets that ball out of there very quickly and so far these pass rushers really havent had the chance to get to him but we also havent seen a lot of his scrambling where a lot of his trademark plays come from very efficient only one incomplete pass to this in the pocket this time im going in <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> the tight end great tax <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> is going to be out there working against <person player="clay matthews" race="UNK" position="LB">clay matthews</person> and i thought this thing was overthrown all the way that catch beautiful <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> doing it blocking on these guys and now receiving over the top and he get his hand under it i think he did to the line quickly and now <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> is going to escape gets away and then throws it away in the stands <person player="josh boyd" race="UNK" position="DE">josh boyd</person> put the pressure on that time you know one of the things for young quarterbacks is that they just have to develop some trust in their receivers to make plays like this give them opportunities these guys are brilliant pros and i think brussels <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> fully understands now once wow just give guys like <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> or <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> or <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> some opportunities think back to <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> and that fourth down play in the championship game play that one didnt go season for him good camilla too 7:10 they get the harmon crush the pullon flag is thrown and winds up with wall well see about the penalty jewish <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> is there for the tackle john <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">perry</person> making the call here offside defense and that s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> you know <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> really had never played an outside linebacker and he was getting ready to go to carolina thinking you just go home and finish his career there and then the green bay packers called and said id you like to be a standup 34 outside linebacker he s that ive been waiting my whole life to have a chance to do that loves it and weve got assume he s gonna get better and better at it as he goes so he flew north instead of south as marsha it s a gain of 21 yards pull back just in the game <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> watch this fly this out the inside linebacker gets the angle theyre on <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> and there goes <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and if youre a defensive back that is the last thing you want to see coming down to fact look at this monster five 11 to 15 who can ever forget that day against new orleans in the playoffs a couple years back on it one away i snap to the 11yard arvin can line up a lot of places i dont think it probably wont see him do is take a direct snap gonna get who knows well here s what happens is he comes out from the outside defensively you think youre looking at an empty set a pure pass situation all of a sudden <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> comes in the backfield they hand in the ball and he runs like a running back marvin comes out second down and one leave the fullback in near <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> to the outside this would have been stopped instead is able to move forward and pick up the first down broke away from clinton dicks aha clinton dicks is finding out the nfl s a little different in the sec good is alabama and there or as a safety you hope youre going to make this tackle but not many people do against <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and dom capers knew it he said if we try and tackle this guy with one guy gonna be a long night for us under four minutes until halftime is first and goal putting it back and he goes touchdown <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> pickin right up for his left off the last two years seven carries 59 yards and a touchdown to give the seattle elite ago read option here but youre going to have a kickout block against matthews he never sees it coming and cant get there on the backside and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> just walks in <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> throwing a nice walk stealing <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> go to the extra point and the seahawks that time go 70 yards in sixth place four of them on the ground to here and as we open the 2014 season at 17 well the stars coming out okay the winter will see all of these guys at one time or another on sunday night barry leading us into the game gradually and have a baby so exciting mike fischer congratulations and we love having a superstar like carrie underwood kicking off our show every sunday night she is fantastic busy household mike fischer ready to go to training camp of the national creditors in the national hockey league that s taken by <person player="micah hyde" race="nonwhite" position="DB">micah</person> hive in the end zone and we go to the show well right tackle brian belaga went to the locker room after they looked at his left knee and took the brace off his left knee now keep in mind he missed the entire season last year with a torn acl in his left he is questionable to a turn as for dynein richard rogers who me he has a stinger that s sort of a nerve irritation in his neck he also is questionable out right thank you michelle there is roger z s standing along the sidelines what university of california barking sending in the floor rogers hang it in the pocket and then it goes to his train in barlas for a gain of 18 it was interesting hearing <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> talking about andrew corliss he said you know he s a guy who doesnt always look that great in practice and you dont think that much then you get him in the game when the chance now drafted in the fifth round 2010 out of penn state <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> behind garnish seattle defense is right there to meet him at the line of scrimmage led by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> third year they picked him in the second round in 2012 he s the second round or and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> s the third round boy they draft so well in seattle john schneider pete carroll we picked up some degree too in preseason but great so far second in town crowd and full throw here play clock down under oh rogers he started a call for time and then you got the rookie center who wants to snap it and he s getting an earful here from rogers the rogers calling tyler his snack the timeout green thirty seconds yes theyre fine anytime i look like the super bowl yeah michele tafoya back in seattle youve seen <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> at the line of scrimmage trying to communicate with his linemen well coach mike mccarthy radios in the place inside <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> stillman with similar speakers and weve got a radio just like mike mccarthy s let s see what it sounds like in all those toys out sounds like brunch to me it s 2010 after the timeout with rogers just good given age to dump over the middle and stocks is able to lunge for the first down so a big first down picked up here on a second and 10 and that s going to take us to the twominute warning good along gear a twominute warning 1710 seattle turn at a halftime coming up they had told me an ironic check it in their thoughts on the first half and then bob and hines will be here to take a look at sunday night s matchup in denver linear outside seattle the back was done with two minutes to go and a first and ten at the 49 yard line walks up by seven and rogers gets it away quickly fixed release farlis makes the catch beam of about six rodgers very much under control now obvious analyst oclock all the way down i want to give the seahawks a chance at the hall made points on the board we need a running its 31st play it s a swingthe starts and he s going to be forced out of bounds to make it third down <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> is there and that s gonna make it third down and three <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> says man i gotta do everything i can to keep from getting bored mr bored the knife he s nothing zero has done as well you ever see him do that thing where he goes that s what it is because five four you can go away from these days on this side like rocket for run a snuck up front rogers able to step away from it throwing and rogers was he across the line he had the first real man he did i had to do is take another two steps and he had that first door now maybe not that was <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> was coming up on him maybe that was what he was thinking but guy as elusive as rogers is there s the line and it s not over the line up as long as that back foot is still on that line it s not a penalty but i just thought he had a chance to run so fourth down now theyll have to punt with this one matchdays kick wouldnt bounce and it takes a nice seattle as it comes back to the 17 yard line that s seattle player were really close to that goal and i think that s what the packers are saying if it just lays its foot right <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> if it touches them it s a live ball did not course they want a flag they want to look at it see if this ball touches the foot <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> i dont think he really knows where it is now it did not know not until the packers player touched it anyway for sure i mean they touched it first i think he was close yeah john coon who was the first guy there so youve got 66 seconds and seattle has all of its timeouts you know a year ago at this time on opening day i think you probably run it a few times get out of here because green bay doesnt have their timeout after what we saw <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> tonight and in the super bowl and probably let him work this a little these bombs away if they want turban into the backfield bound by <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> and he cant get out of bounds the clock will keep going under a minute the acara looking up at the clock they have all of their timeouts dont take one here second down and six and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> under pressure and runs right into matthews a flag is down he got matthews and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> both there and a flag is down in the secondary at the 32 yard line oh boy this one s gonna hurt you go from a sack and into the half you can automatic first down if it is illegal contact defense number 59 inside linebacker <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> and there goes the sack and seattle has a first down little double move here by <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> and you can see the grab not a difficult call at all five seconds youre gonna put three more seconds back on the clock there it is a thirty five seconds the ball is at the 26 yard line against seattle is going to get the ball to start the second half front of canada near the end of the first kirby take it up to the 35 yard line an outoftown timeout right here for 27 seconds and we can tell you that this kickoff special is being brought to you by ge presenting the boy who beats by toyota let s go places by verizon more live games than ever before with nfl mobile and by <person player="andrew mcdonald" race="UNK" position="OT">mcdonald</person> s official sponsor the nfl in lebanon that s gonna be on the voice this year lost that show get lucky not you i was born like quarterback s tonight not too many incompletions in this game only touch that fast but walking to the longing of the smiling mr <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> before this one said and done one of these two quarterbacks is going to scramble around and make a big play that may end up deciding it on a film marry second of three motion in and almost intercepted by clinton dicks <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> and got behind him the clinton dix head position incomplete third and three nice play by clinton dix here he is going to be right here and when <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> moved to his right his hope was that clinton dix the young rookie was going to go with him he did not held his ground he s missed a couple of tackles tonight the perfect coverage theyre an angry <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> got him that was pretty funny stuff wasnt it yeah they talked about every day <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> is angry at something 33 keep it on the ground and suck his turban and they will take a timeout 14 seconds left 14 seconds left seattle would need a good chunk of yardage to afford <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> to the opportunity to attack on three more monsters careerlong 54 so they need to get it somewhere around the 35 yard line give him a realistic chance there s about 25 yards he is or something s gonna take it out of the shotgun form and walk throw that away and that s going to chew up a total of four seconds leaving ten on the clock and tell you the past rush of the packers is starting to have a little impact busting <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">britt</person> the rookie on the outside and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> kind of throws him aside as <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> starts to go and on the other side russell o <person player="john kuhn" race="white" position="RB">kuhn</person> who s coming off that toe surgery in the offseason and he s just getting back into form so well keep an eye on this as we go then gets into the 48 but even with the time out here that s gonna be well out of housekeys range or anybody s rainy and thatll do it for the first half so on opening night seattle leaving we may by a score of 17 to 10 with the hawks getting the ball when we start the second half coming up next thrown a half ton after these messages from your nbc station the toyota halftime let s go places at halftime the seahawks lead the packers 1710 hines ward coming off the first and <person player="patrick lewis" race="UNK" position="C">patrick</person> tony dungy and rodney <person player="dujuan harris" race="UNK" position="RB">harris</person> berry bob thank you it pains me to give you credit rodney but in the pregame you said you didnt want <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> back there returning punts he s back there because golden tate is left went to detroit so you didnt like it and he ended up with a month punt and dan also said that he s the best free safety in the league i never said that he was the best punt returner but i saw him warm enough he didnt look comfortable back then he dropped one and also hines ward pointed out <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> is always on the defensive left they put <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> on the other side worked on <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> thing that impressed me about green bay was the physical player that offensive line it hasnt always been like that though they piloted in here got the lead and they have been very very impressive now let s look at seattle because we werent sure how much offense or how much defense green bay was going to have that how much often seattle was going to be able to put up here what have you seen so far that s a little bit different with seattle but what they wanted to do they wanted to get <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> involved really early and that s what they did they gotten the ball in so many different ways whether it was a jet screen whether it was a handoff dan they come out he s so versatile they line them up in so many different places and then it starts with marsalis that physical running style getting people to play the run sets up this this is the new off the read option running play not there but now i can throw it when the defense reacts and this is what they try to do they try to come out with all these strict ways and they wear you down with marsala de maras on bit cutback lane because they read out some pass seattle s offense is playing out state gets stronger as the game goes on okay what do you expect second half start with green bay green bay i expect them to do the same thing stay patient dont get away from the run game dont come out here and try to spread this team out and pass the ball 3040 times run the football what seattle do well seattle is doing a good job of keeping <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> in the pocket theyre gonna keep feeding <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> and keep beating harvard guys coming up look ahead to the colts and broncos on sunday night football but first it takes a lifetime of work and dedication to become one of the greats and this week coach t catches up with two of his finest recruits ever seahawks 17 packers 10 at halftime meanwhile sunday night on nbc the broncos host the colts in denver it s the second time peyton manning will play against his old team and his successor andrew luck and last year in the midst of memorable seasons for both clubs when manning went back to indy after an emotional scene before the game it was the colts who took care of business indianapolis can now say thanks for the memories anytime youre matched up against peyton manning it is an io resigned in my mind that it s part of the job comingout party for a guy that doesnt need one things change and i have transitioned into this second chapter of my football career in denver broncos have helped me with that transition there s the record 50 first touchdown wade outfitters he white got it he s gonna score it s the second biggest comeback in nfl history hey bros touchdown demaryius thomas denver the champions of the american football conference okay hines ward story line here wes welker suspended four games for pe d use now that came just on the eve of the season practically losing eric decker in the offseason was one thing you have a chance to figure out what to do this is a double block oh it is no question but the huge blow has to be wellthought because peyton manning loses his go and in a short period of time i dont know if he can establish that rapport with anyone what can they do well emmanuel sanders the guy that i played with you can put him on the inside he does have experience playing in the slot it s just difficult to put a rookie in that slot position because the slot position is normally your quarterback other wild receivers all right times well see on sunday night tomorrow on the today show live from denver and dc in the nfl begin a seasonlong celebration of fans across america it s called together we make football josh <person player="jayrone elliott"

kickoffs game changers brought to you by bo s official sound of the nfl just playing angry out here makes the catch bitch into the end whose official sound of the nfl well the first half of the first of 256 games this season regular season completed a look at downtown seattle al michaels with cris collinsworth michelle the first half buzz with the score seattle s 17 green bay 10 <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> fumbled a punt return that led to a toon touchdown run green bay the lead meanwhile <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> out almost all of last season after hip surgery had a big first and with five catches <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> averaging only 48 yards per fess and 86 yards as the defense has done its work for c allen <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> in that she s informed with seven carries for 59 yards in a nine yard touchdown run ya know <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="WR">bj</person> raji i think is hurting a little bit when youre trying to stop <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> theyre great nose down here s the ticket marvin told us yesterday he s coming out it doesnt go out of the end zone and he does here but not very far good special teams work by green bay ball of the thirteen and we go to michelle well <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> had that muffed punt in the first half and pete carroll told me at halftime he spoke to him and he trusts hell be making the right decisions from now on as far as what he expects from green bay s offense here in the second half he said we just have to keep them in front of us meanwhile for the packers brian belonga their right tackle is done for the night with that left knee injury as far as the pace of the packers offense we expected them to go at warp speed but mike mccarthy told me i have no problem with the pace of our offense when i have a problem with is us not breaking tackles and us not making tackles on defense all right thank you michelle and that could be a very significant injury the málaga if he is awkward and he curry at a time tons of the pace they ran pinky to first half play links often running again take him over 70 yards as he picks up 14 on the first scrimmage play of the third quarter talk a little bit about big <person player="james carpenter" race="nonwhite" position="OG">james carpenter</person> right here and what he s been able to do just so much better conditioned and that is a big man he pushed out of the way <person player="mike daniels" race="nonwhite" position="DT">mike daniels</person> theyre probably as strong a defensive linemen as they have but so far the the big three of seattle is out playing the big play for the green bay packers at least offense from the 28 to the outside there he goes again that s a tenyard game his <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> finally runs them out of bounds so <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> right now the linchpin of this office tonight bespoke 9 carries 82 yards and a touchdown these two backs are pretty similar theyre powerful guys and they can run you over but they also have that great quickness in the hole i mean that is a lot of moves for a guy the size of <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> he gets a blow turban is now the back and here he goes up to the 41 yard line heat would be the second or third back as the season moves along they also have christened the michael who was drafted in the second round on a texas a&amp;m in last year that he s inactive tonight just watch the moves inside the hole that s what makes a great running back everybody always they turn on you know the combine and they want to watch a 40yard dash time and a deadly run for three who cares because all it matters for running backs is how does he do in tight spaces and can you make people miss and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> i think maybe the best in it and the league as far as a big back could be a steamroller what he has to do from the 41 stepping up and once and hit as he throws they got him by the back foot and the pass is incomplete pepper s putting the charge on second to ten <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> coming around the edge on russell oh coon a very good player but again a little rusty because he s coming off of that toe surgery and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> even against the five man rush one of the things they were worried about in green bay was rushing him with just four because that always leaves a gap somewhere for a russell to step up and crew and so now theyve been bringing some fiveish like a threeman rush this time though theyre coming the grips to listen gets to the office contact there s an incidental why <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">lockette</person> is the intended receiver mccarthy wants a flag <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> covering on the play no offensive interference third downs i tell you <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> has what i call cocky speed he s the guy that s not afraid to get in your face he turns around and i dont think that is interference although theyre supposed to be tough on the defensive backs and the receivers this year with all that i dont know that we had one holding poll on <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> but this hasnt been called anywhere near like it was in the preseason preseason they were flag crazy there goes <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> sitting up in the slot out of the empty backfield <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> who turns the other that s a great tackle by saying <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shields</person> this wonder if <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> had any opportunity here to turn it up the field at any time he thought he might be able to outrun one more but <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> one of the fastest guys in the nfl on him by the shoelaces and make sure he didnt get the first down his fortune for <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> sets up at the nine yard john lyon griese box who created carol coming here in 2010 whoo with backspin on the punt fair catch this ball for and made at the 40yard line they gets the ball for the first time of us when we come back to centurylink field tonight s kickoff special being brought to you by bo s official sound of the nfl by the new samsung galaxy s5 that xpecting is here mercedesbenz experience truly great engineering today dealer tv if it goes up the sports man seems rocks came home degree filming tonight now green bay first possession second half 14 yard line the fingertips of medicine intercepted by <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron maxwell</person> flag is down and that s where well get tackled inside the ten shoving and pushing afterward the flag is down and the seahawks offense is already coming out on to the fear is compiled away by his fans to get so many things going through the wrong item one of those you just kind of throw it into the hole of the zone and <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron</person> just let it a little too far and for <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron maxwell</person> what he did last year he got the play in the last five games through to some injuries and suspensions and all of a sudden he had four interceptions in those five games so at some point maybe <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> does get a chance brandon browner is gone so <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> took over and here tonight starting on the other come here and that s sure another gorilla because he knows if he makes plays eventually offenses have to balance out no doubt it sets them up in the 8 yard line on the 1st and goal well see beatson growing and complete curse was the intended receiver williams covering itll be second and goal same play they scored the touchdown on earlier that s that read option pass that time tremont williams i think it was did not take the bait he s off and inside and instead of coming up to attack <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> here after that fake he stayed back with his receiver he had to throw it away watch come on williams his eyes on the quarterback takes a little fall step but then recognizes it good play second down and goal lynx lining up deep in the back pictures way over the left side third down and goal early the third quarter and that 10 carries now for <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> for 87 yards other guys we havent talked much about <person player="max unger" race="white" position="C">max unger</person> right in the middle of their pro bowl center nice job reaching and you just want to wonder i think that s the troy guy on in there yep and he did not play very much either after getting let go by the minnesota vikings and right now three receivers check to the right <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> goes to the left when the pass is batted at the line of scrimmage and take it in at the three yard line <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> covering on the play pass incomplete so fourth down and goal and in comes the field goal group <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> has had a bunch of injuries but a big play here and for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> that s the second tip ball that could have possibly been intercepted that is you sort of escape so sometimes youre good and sometimes youre lucky and sometimes youre both i think <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is both mouseka now for a 20yard field goal attempt about the distance of an extra point and that s good to give them a projection victor <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> allen also owns the portland trailblazers of the nba chairman of the seahawks is on this team for well over a decade made about a gazillion dollars at microsoft he was there with bill gates and there s the super bowl xlviii ring that the seahawks and the staff will get you go back to super bowl one and that s what the green bay packers wound up getting after we beat kansas city where s the owners come in all shapes and sizes steve ballmer was there at and microsoft infant than <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> allen yeah you think owning the clippers that s a little bit different too i would take either one of them eat the ring yes sir it still means the exact same deal through how many diamonds around true well unless you make a comeback your career records well the legion of boom theyre getting it done so far iron <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> he s been picked on tonight with so far <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> to come up with those big for the first time all night <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> is over on <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> 1394 cashiers with : 31 yards tonight we toss it to <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lacy</person> he s trying to get out of the backfield and does but not very far gain of two before he s forced out of bounds itll be second down and eight and you know this offensive line now for the green bay packers is dangerously thin polakov just yet but he s had a lot of injury issues they see twitter that was definitely a concern second date lazy and were gonna show one of the members of the legion of boom <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> is out with a groin injury he was limited in practice all week because of that groin injury he plays nicolau but no more tonight so he is on that probably means <person player="marcus burley" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus burley</person> will be in the other guy yeah herald <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> is another guy that they like inactive tonight as well because early pick trade with the let s see if they go after him six and they will go to <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> instead flirty <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> pulls it in making the cats along the sidelines and that s enough for a first down sort of flip it back over and here s <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> going to go a little back shoulder maybe a little closer look i kind of got it with just one hand that s what these receivers have gotten to now they sort of hold off the defender one hand and catch it with the other back to the ground lacey s spinning away were gonna get spun down <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> coming in to clean it up at the end i tell you this this run defense has been the most impression impressive for me so far for the seattle seahawks yes that we know about the legion of boom and then get all the credit the pass russians up <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> and all those guys but <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> if they cant stop the one they cant get into all their kind of coverage things that they want to do and it was about midseason they gave up a couple of big was tampa and around doing a lot of tackling rogers quick release and calm cant and it will be third down sir <person player="marcus burley" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus burley</person> covering on that place and they go his way we just paid for that six round draft choice here we go right here going to try and swing him up the boundary again same sort of play kind of pressure he must be feeling coming into the lead picon well here just got here this week and that dealing the colts third and flower finding time hits bob over the middle for a first down tackled by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> and <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> and that moves the chains on the 3rd and 12 it s a gain of 23 yards let s give some credit here to the big guy <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick</person> s rod working against one of the best pass rushers in the game <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april here s the guy was the firstround draft pick and ended up with a broken leg and some real issues hasnt been luck quick drop pass to the outside <person player="jordan hill" race="UNK" position="DT">jordan</person> <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> will take it and shove that amounts by the next will after he picks up six yards itll be second down or four youve got jody <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> on the outside whenever they give him just a little bit of room an offensive players theyre going to do those kind of offensive stiff arms and get away six dashes from ocean 45 yards the backfield bake the starts and then down at the line of scrimmage by <person player="kevin williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">kevin williams</person> part of that famed williams wall he and pat williams for many years in minnesota they picked him up in the offseason and kevin wavers one of the great players sort of at the end of his career now but they were really happy to get him he lost a lot of big guys out there red wine else because in this division against the you better have some as well in fact the seahawks 46 guys who are regular starters late dang it in gettin out survey cross the field and broken up at the goal line maxvill staying right with him and not giving an inch itll be fourth and five wyatt <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> showed his arm strength he was all the way outside the numbers on the right and <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> sort of throw up his arm all the way back to the left and he almost got this thing in there but if there was a little chance for maybe pass interference let s see the very end of this play good job though by mack slow getting his head around so no interference i want that play clock we started because they got a lineup at least wine will they snap at the hill they do and rogers almost get sent and then there s it s a <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> averell so they game will they go for get the ball in great field position seven minutes left in the third night talks like that before that failed for that play you had seen mccarthy on the sidelines raising the palm to the sky meaning reset the play clock the play before that was that long pass to the goal line they did reset at the 40 the mic was still arguing the point during our commercial to no avail obviously as this is <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> who s going to gain 16 yards for a first down and chris you got to think at this particular point in the game at 22 minutes to play in the game the gulf war to midfield down by tennyson very surprising cool well maybe you say okay youre gonna go for four years whatever youre gonna just do it but then you could tell it was screwed up well and at that point because they burned through all their timeouts at the first half im sure he was thinking i dont want to take a timeout here and so they ended up in a bad play they just werent ready to snap the football on the cost of the sack you could tell youre not a sync when your coach is asking for the play clock to be reset <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> going nowhere the s<person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> s come back in here today in it ended up having a pretty nice game he s had a lot of injuries during the course of his career but the feeling here is that they have so many different guys they can rotate in and out not a lot of defensive linemen but a lot of guys that can play multiple positions as <person player="mike neal" race="UNK" position="DT">mike neal</person> and <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> they can move them up they can move them down they really feel like that versatility is going to give them an edge throughout the year incomplete come on williams breaking it up and boy what you know when you got a guy like <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> youre gonna use a lot of play action and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> did last year well this year as well we talked a little bit about <person player="nick perry" race="nonwhite" position="LB">nick perry</person> we talked about jamming guys coming off the line of scrimmage that would be that he s a grown man out here he s grown in on the green bay side we need a win oh here comes to walk around they sniff that one out and haha clinton dicks makes the tackle now they had no body and this amoeba defense with their hand on the ground look at that everybody s standing up now who s going to come where there they go come around there and clinton dick s comes up and makes a nice play so let s give some credit to green bay s defense that could very easily been a big turning point after going for it on fourth down and they get to stop absolutely that s exactly what they needed and now were going to get the ball back still down by 10 points your honor is season the fair catch is pulled for there by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> under five to play third twenty to ten see ya the <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> function there is your super bowl and the mouthing <person player="malcolm smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">smith</person> that a great postseason in a simple that passed against san francisco of the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> deflection and that rogers is gonna lose the ball and it s loose in the end zone and covering it up to at least save five points in the end zone is <person player="derek sherrod" race="UNK" position="OT">derek sherrod</person> <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> came in the sack bumble and then at least with a flag now down at the end of the play for the moment at least he save five points dereck <person player="derek sherrod" race="UNK" position="OT">sherrod</person> this is going to be a long night this is starting to look like the super bowl the denver broncos simply could not handle the outside pass rush of the seattle seahawks and it s starting to look more and more and more like that here very ruling on the field is a fumble recovered by the offense by rule but to see took off the tackle <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> michael bennet so fast but also great with his hands watch him sweep the hands away of <person player="derek sherrod" race="UNK" position="OT">derek</person> s rod and come in and strip the ball out it s one thing to get the sack it s another to get that ball out and <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> anybody you talked to from the green bay packers they said he is the guy that stirs the drink here that when you get him going bad things happen and every since brian belaga went out that s been a mismatch sex then it was the guy who started his career here but him last long with the tampa and then they brought him back we had like nine sacks or something it s an but somehow he got out of there he comes back here and they become a multimillionaire now he was fantastic last year you can play him outside you can play him inside and dtackle you get him against some of those guards it s just not fair so were like back in the superbowl days with justin tuck when they first put him down inside so now instead of a free kick from the 20yard line it s half the distance to the goal and they kick off the free kick will come from the 10 yard line and <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harvin</person> will have an opportunity in all likelihood to run this one back be careful now <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> backed up wouldnt feel real good about this situation five hot and fitted with coverage here by green bay take him down at the 47 yard line but again seattle starts this drive from midfield you know it s interesting how is that jet sweep that theyve been running <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> on super bowl ii never stopped it in this game they never stopped you have three times for 38 yards you can pick up 13 yards per carry teeth bed what a factor he s going to be he can stay healthy this season it s part of the reason they could let golden tate leave pass sidney rice also retired in an off season another one of their white <person player="davon house" race="nonwhite" position="DB">house</person> trying to get that first down a little bit short though kind of about nine and a half over the middle would be right in <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach</person> piller take a look at <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> of course i think played one regularseason game last year super bowl any way they can get him the ball in space that s the goal here s the little it happened so fast defenses dont even know where the ball is now you get them up to feel it it morning forehead just couldnt even get his hand and this guy is just going to be a huge second in a short yard and they give a turban and that s a first down <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> makes the tackle under four minutes to go now in the third quarter ill tell you the other guy out talked about is <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> he was their top draft pick even though drafted in the second round mvp from colorado and they talked about him and the speed that they he has is frightening and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> says his hands are even better than a speed looks like a centerfielder or a shortstop making plays on the ball six feet in just 183 is richie the it s away from gillian s for the moment takes the ball to the 35 yard line and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn</person> is on his way to a triple figure night i mean almost on every carry now he has at least one broken tackle on that one there were two and when youre playing defense and you get a guy most running backs are going down they played that pretty well i got a guy hit him in the backfield <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> but he couldnt get him on the ground so now it s you know checking 693 yards thatd be a first <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> it s taken out of bounds by four well we never talked too much about zack <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> with the other weapons on this offense but he has been nothing short of fantastic tonight blocking pass rushing outside linebackers making that diving catch down the field coming across the field here you get a guy that can play like an offensive lineman sort of the true old classic blocking tight in and still make plays in the passing game that s strong im taking the way would have been a green big interception early again that s a great point two minutes left in the quarter on a first and ten <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> just blows it away definite that second down there just arent many young quarterbacks that do that as well as he does young quarterbacks never want to give up on a play right they always want to think they can do something whatever then they throw interceptions <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> at least three times in this game that i can remember has been outside in trouble nowhere to go throw it out of bounds hey well get him next time cerebrum he and <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> they get together they drive around and they go you know what you realize how lucky we are let s be legendary second down and ten katako but then three other packers are right there i was interesting here in <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> talking about going to children s hospital with <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> and visiting a young lady there that had been recently paralyzed a sevenyearold and just how blessed he felt just to be getting back in the car and that was all they talked about on the way home and he was trying to do what those men have done already which is when backtoback super bowls so every one of those is in the hall of fame except for brady and where she will be five years after his retirement 1310 who is the ameba gene kranz again everybody up thought carvin close to a first down back home there by <person player="morgan burnett" race="nonwhite" position="DB">morgan burnett</person> yeah be for this you know i mean dom capers drawing up everything he can think of but somebody s got to cover that guy i havent seen anybody can do that yet and i dont know any safety and foot so when you go to some of those empty sets and spread sets that means linebackers and safeties have to get involved and covering one of the great threats in the game let me finish you can take your immediate we can do with it first and ten from the 15yard line <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> is going to keep it first now taking them all on the 3yard line there s that fourman rush again and if youre going to do there s going to be a gap and nobody does a better job than <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> when you rush for finding that little spot that he can wiggle through and then even more impressive he knew when to get down 322 10 seattle and near threatening at dusk in the northwest tonight s aerial coverage is being brought to you by geico now michaels four styles worth michele tafoya the person 256 stricken the season games in the nfl it s a 12point game and she al trying to make it more a first and goal from the 3 yard line <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> the running back they had to pull back in there as well there goes marsh on into the end zone again for touchdown his second of the night they go three yards and nine plays five brushes and for passwords id say what <person player="james carpenter" race="nonwhite" position="OG">james carpenter</person> does not make this play a year ago here he is coming right out here and hooking that defensive end that was playing outside of him an incredibly tough block he got him pinned and they got a walk in touchdown great play by james carville ill stuff in the five world champions looking every bit like world champions twenty nine to ten sunday night is football night we go to denver from here in 72 hours sunday night football itll be the coast and the broncos football night america the nfl this is a sunlight in the pacific northwest rock and night in this park centrelink like the hide tackled at the 18yard line so the long road ahead seattle has scored 19 on a points and lee this kickoff special tonight brought to you by the soft surface the nfl by nissan innovation of excites by corona inviting it a fine viewer and by eight far from his stadium maybe the green bay down by 19 and rogers growing and it s caught for a first down by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> up at the 33 yard line the exact same play that they threw the interception on just threw it right into the gap between the linebackers one of the problems you have when you play against the seattle team their linebackers are so athletic and get such deep drops it really creates problems for your passing game and so far tonight rogers everything s been on and has dumped off here lacey right into <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> you dont want too many of those battles but he did there and picks up the first down that gives you some idea what kind of man <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> is <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> probably the heaviest hitting safety in the game watch this collision on the back end here dancer comes up free shot stands them up but cant get him on the ground nice anyways we enchanted green bay needing a quick strike to get back in it hey she s spinning away this time got away from <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> once again to the 48 yard line <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> normally a downfield pastor but tonight when you look at his numbers passing by distance he s thrown only four balls more than 11 yards of 16 of 19 underneath and two of four beyond 10 and no yard that s what makes seattle so great they this is a team lika what you got to get the ball out let s go rodgers music closed that s brought by <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">cobb</person> not picture going to seattle sarasota the city 9 yard line is wrapped up there by burleigh this <person player="marcus burley" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus burley</person> is going to take on a bigger and bigger role in seattle we already know they dont flipflop their corners so they tried to pick on <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> a little bit but now you bring in a new guy <person player="marcus burley" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus burley</person> and if youre gonna have a shot probably youre gonna say alright ive got to take my shot <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall</person> rogers that change stark s said to reach back for it next to nothing there s a flag down homie offense 69 10yard penalty first down it s <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">david bakhtiari</person> i think he was holding <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> good to see <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> back in after that hip surgery it s all they need around here is one more pass rusher he s had a few holding calls over the last year the grab around the shoulders and that s what they call it but <person player="david bakhtiari" race="white" position="OT">bakhtiari</person> was really started all 16 left tackle micra pin it down and doors for us in 20 youre second alone like ham <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> because he makes the catch and the ball is spotted with the 37 yard line what a good throw by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> watch this little sidearm dart in there <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> finding out what so many others have and chancel is the enforcer in that far second than eight after the gain of quo and he s going to be a yard short of the first down though spotted at the 30yard line <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> makes the tackle third and one now youre starting to see them picking up the pace a little bit theyre trying to pin these pass rushers on the field for extended periods of time fourthorder first game gonna see rogers flows and that little move to change the ball taken by <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">nelson</person> jordi to the 20yard line jordi really had a little chance to run with that one but sometimes take a shot from damn <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> you remember at the next time good job though by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> getting that ball out of his hand quickly nine catches the loss of the right foot sarch on the ground spinning away look at the rule next to the outside will he turn a lot of nothing into something takes the ball inside the ten that s just fantastic <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> s going to shoot down inside and almost hit james starts in the backfield and then it was just all starts remember the run that this guy had going to the super bowl he was fantastic historic for the short side of the field inside and takes the ball to the three yard line really second down and goal as we took down to ten minutes left in regulation where that was good by andrew dieeee the thai thinh loud that when it happened and now you kind of see the look at seattle they got their hands on your hips theyve pinned those guys out theyre not let them substitute long drive over five minutes guarded at the 18yard line of greenberg and throwing its plot for a touchdown bipod so exactly what wed be needed not only a touchdown but to do it with some alacrity even though it did take 524 but at least nine and a half remain on the clock and after the extra point it could be a 12point game well when you get your running game going then you can do things like this with the bootleg nice job by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> i think theyre going for today rbi so to make it 11 was that letter you go to eight and three as opposed to 12 points means youre definitely going to need two touchdowns and the worst you come out of this filter touchdown get them to annotate the twopoint conversion in a few goal and pump fakes in and throws and the pass is incomplete then did the parlance of spade 13 point game with 931 in the fourth quarter in seattle 29 to 16 selphie heaven huh beautiful night here though that was great day temperature the game time 71 not what s cooler than that <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> is back to receive on side well theyre lining up now they spread it out this would not quite be a surprise onside kick and it wont be period well <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">harvin</person> who s going to come out with it but he decides better so you know you look at the seattle seahawks and every year people say you know can a team repeat and of course you can repeat as we said at the beginning of the show but well you look at this team especially in this stadium counting postseason 17 and one over the last two years youre gonna have to beat them here eventually if youre gonna knock them off and you know i think back to that san francisco and the championship game and and maybe how all these fortunes are different if they dont hit that fourth in 20 whatever that one play was and the play at the end of the game but you know those two teams you got to think theyre still gonna be right theyre battling to the end so the coach pete carroll taught 1401 <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke</person> <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> making the grab you go back to the last nine super bowl champions and what s not only amazing is that you havent had anybody repeat but you only had one team that even won the postseason game you go all the way back to the the patriots when they beat jacksonville after the old five season that was it matea bring you bay s defense could get a three in out here because seattle s defense was a little tired on that last drive in a three now and get a right back on the field bonus may start looking a little different around here my name s <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> it s gonna set up a third and six trying to chew a little clock up here one of the guys that they like is this one day tone jones here and youll see him slide right down the line of scrimmage and because theyve got so many guys now that playing these versatile roles theyre rolling these guys in last year with all the injuries they really didnt have that ability but they have a lot of top draft picks now theyre all healthy and doing a pretty good job out here third and six they move all of the play clock will sing the flag and the pass is incomplete bust it up thereby <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shields</person> flag is down at the 27 yard line it s a holding call which way is your gonna go with this four this is huge holding defense <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> again <person player="brad jones" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brad jones</person> gonna get beat right off the line of scrimmage here and as soon as he does he grabs and they are not going to do that that s one thing theyve said from the very beginning if they see that jersey tug they are going to call it that was third down i was off the field that s his second big holding call this game in so many levels because it s going to take a lot of time off the clock now take a good 35 seconds between play and this is <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> taking the ball after the 31 yard line and the defense is going to get a little bit more rest that defense which you know were always overstating things in football well you look back to that 85 bears team and these guys were right there with him you know i played against the 85 bears team in 86 so a year later and they beat us 41 to nothing at home and we had a good team and i didnt think id ever see a defense that could compete with that bunch but the way these guys played in the new sort of passing era of football last year sanna was right there waiting second date screen is set up to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> and leash will pick up the first down on a reception that takes him to the 45 and on the prior play his carry was a 17 and put him at a hundred and one yards here is the power of <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> they sent him across the motion theyve been jet sweep infect pump fake that way come back the entire defense shifts over with <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> and they pick up a first down on the screen the other way to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> great play calling ill tell you darrell bevell hate to tell you see ally aint gonna be here long he is called a fantastic game here tonight no i mentioned before he had a couple of interviews last year and probably no reason his hear is that he couldnt be fired until they finished the super bowl turban pizza for can tell you how many times tonight ive seen green bay packers defenders and defensive linemen in the backfield and just unable to make a tackle i mean both these guys both the backs turbans breaking tackles it was bevel checking the play card that was just a killer holding call second and six sliding to a halt after he picks up the first down so tonight seattle just killing the packers on the ground 190 wonder how big is that loss of <person player="bj daniels" race="UNK" position="WR">bj</person> roger it s huge and in every aspect but anytime you get the running game going the way that it is and for the green bay packers this is kind of an ongoing issue i think that they felt like maybe they had a few things solved with all their guys being back and healthy and nobody has solved the seattle seahawks five minutes in the fourth catches me just inside the 40 lockett scored a touchdown earlier than the deccan some of these numbers nfl history just two guys 50 or more td passes in a thousand no more rush yards in any twoyear span of course cunningham did it a few years into his career he did it in 89 and 90 and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> did it in his first two seasons and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> i love the conversation he had with michael <person player="jordan hill" race="UNK" position="DT">jordan</person> about okay it s one thing to make yourself better it s something else to make everybody around you better and that really hit home i think for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and he is very much leader this team to the 20 yard they just motioned him into the backfield from that indian offense number 86 10yard penalty the replay second down i saw that block i didnt know if it was just a great block or a hole let s take a look a little hold a little flop little yeah you wanna call but he got the call i think that was more flop than hold nonetheless with for a team to go at second down and 12 back at the 46 yard line eating drive and it s to stay in bounds and because that at the quarry on <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hayward</person> put his hand into his helmet and he s going to get a penalty on top of him well <person player="casey hayward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">hayward</person> is signalling facemask like <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> did it to him personal foul face mask defense first out fear there s a stiff arm that s legal but that is trying to take his helmet off and that is illegal and the green bay packers in many ways of selfdestructed they tried to go for it on 4th down never got themselves set missed that one too huge holding calls just not a good effort tonight by green bay against a very good team and you have to be almost perfect to come in here knock off this bunch but the big concern for me with the packers right now the depth on that offensive line and whether or not theyre going to be able to survive the entire season and went also you look at that green base schedule now chris really important next week they go home to meet the jets theyll be favored but then the next two games after that on the road in the division at detroit and at chicago pretty interesting now this is a good football team you know dont kid yourself but the sometimes when you look back on a season the one thing that gets you is when you get multiple injuries at the same position that more often than not will eat you up ted thompson s done a terrific job and his years is the exact 3p what a great moves him and you know as seattle his dna with the seahorses which takes it to the 15yard line id say it darrell bevell coming back to this again but i love the design theyre killing them with this jet sweep with <person player="percy harvin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">percy harvin</person> so now they come over fake it and just give it to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and there s a humungous hole in there i mean <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> can win if there s no hole you give them a hole that s about eight yards wide youre lucky to get him on the ground 109 yards rushing for <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> 14 more receiving 32 245 to go she s been in front of cool is late for a first down and the packers gonna take a timeout he has to take it looks like it s going to be a fourth down here with 237 remaining in regulation 29 6 well be heading that way i understand we might get a few golfers at the game sunday night huh rory and if you swing thoughts tipoff oh that s right bob uh <person player="phil bates" race="UNK" position="WR">phil</person> pretty good when youre a golfer you just need one name and everybody knows that youre talking about it fourth and one they line up to go for here in his cart and taken into the engine by <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> the fullback and that will write a finish this one is the seattle seahawks will win this one going away no fail mary this time this is a round this is the world champions looking light yeah hardest thing in the world fourth and one youve got big <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> in there and instead of blocking the fullback <person player="derrick coleman" race="nonwhite" position="RB">derrick coleman</person> just slips out in the flat and there s nobody there <person player="sam shields" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sam shields</person> just nothing darrell bevell is just added to the list great night for him first touch of the night that s the point by houston seahawks have rolled up 401 yards and least 36 not too late to play nflcom fantasy enjoyed free new mobile apps you can join drink and waiting from anywhere sign up in nflcom slash fantasy this if you have <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> already happy tonight and there is a <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> trying not to be that board is going to the kick team for stead of bounds at the 25 yard line with 2 minutes and 27 seconds remaining in the nfl 1014 opener talk about a shutdown corner or whatever you want to call them but youve had a great night when nobody even throws your way that s your reputation meanwhile they go <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">maxwell</person> s way and they thrown out of nine times and completed six but he did have a big interception so now green bay and its own 24 yard the drop pass by andrew corliss second and ten and believe it or not there tried to getting up limping a little bit they had a little collusion out there as well so for <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> sometimes realize your fate and get the heck out of here but it s going to be a concern no doubt about it theyre gonna have to do some help over to the right side for a little while they get this offensive line hopefully second and ten this is dawuan <person player="dujuan harris" race="UNK" position="RB">harris</person> the number three back and we go to michelle well we saw <person player="eddie lacy" race="nonwhite" position="RB">eddie lacy</person> take that hard hit from <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> earlier he went to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion was ruled questionable he had a concussion last season as well that took him out for a week out meanwhile no further status on <person player="bryan bulaga" race="white" position="OT">bryan bulaga</person> just out for the knee injury okay thank you michelle and before the snap here we have come upon the twominute warning minutes remaining at open a night in a 20point game seattle looking like the range super bowl champions so a big opening night for seattle latina counting postseason games has won 17 of 18 plus when this one is in the books its third bro and gets it away in prom black is that on however back at the line of scrimmage at the 24 yard line john berry is not moving fast holy it s <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> kind of hold of <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> now <person player="tj lang" race="white" position="OT">tj lang</person> is gonna get beat around by <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> and like so many people have done you get beat you save your quarterback and takes off the board a pretty spectacular play by <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> he could do a lot but he cant do it all and give credit tonight they stopped the running game <person player="byron maxwell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron maxwell</person> <person player="marcus burley" race="UNK" position="DB">marcus burley</person> their backup slot they had their two best receivers over there <person player="jordy nelson" race="white" position="WR">jordy nelson</person> and <person player="randall cobb" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randall cobb</person> and they couldnt get it done i mean it s just as simple as that and the pressure got there in the secondary third and 13 where the secondary s build shot and completely leaves in a boom rodgers had a lot of time they dont leave too many openings in the back end great reaction there by <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> i know he s disappointed didnt come down with that interception what it wouldnt intense young man that is i mean his whole life is dedicated to the game of football he is the first one there and the last one to leave and you hear that sometimes but it s serious with this guy he s there at the crack of dawn he stays late he lives for football just flies around the field i love watching him play one of the great players in the league the statute is fair coin at the 23yard line by brian <person player="bryan walters" race="UNK" position="WR">walters</person> well when your defense is number one to get to the super bowl eight teams have made it when they were ranked number one in points and yards allowed and there it is the last super bowl before the aflnfl merger was the chiefs the only loser would be in super bowl for the chiefs and the vikings in met one banks ramp matriculating the ball down the field that was great and you know one thing that probably wont be talked about in this game <person player="aaron rodgers" race="white" position="QB">aaron rodgers</person> took his team down the field to get his glove right back in it they were down by whatever 13 12 13 something like that and then seattle s offense did what you have to do youre going to be champions you then answer the call you take it the other way for the game flinching touchdown and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and company were so razor sharp tonight as was their defense they can run up where they left off a couple of kneel downs will end it so pete carroll area is the most youthful 62 year old going on 63 next week guile ever see but you know you think about him of all the things with carroll he 20 years ago he s the coach of the new york jets that lasted one year he went to new england in the late 90s bob kraft had inherited bill parcells so parcells leaves after they lose the super bowl and then carol comes in for three years and then crafts goes out and hires belichick so there s a guy who got sandwiched in between parcells and belichick we might sandwich a couple of super bowls with this football team but you know everybody thinks that pete s a guy you get along with and he s great and they play music at practice he said no it s the same formula bill parcells use discipline discipline football players win games and he teaches discipline and these guys he talks about it being a laboratory that he had at usc and he said im doing the same thing now we did at usc the formula works but the guys are discipline were gonna win pretty good century for long mr carroll to national championships even though they took one away at sc a super bowl and a big start tonight and a quest to do it again seattle dominates in the 2014 opener wending the game by a score of 36 216 coming up
