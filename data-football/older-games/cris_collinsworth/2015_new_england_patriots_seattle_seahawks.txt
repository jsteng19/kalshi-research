============================================================

&gt;&gt; arizona is the grand canyon state beautiful look at grand canyon national park couple of hours drive north of the greater phoenix area just a spectacular sunday afternoon and now a look at the university of phoenix stadium, which opened in 2006 and is the home of the arizona cardinals bill belichick wearing his favorite hoodie that no 2 pencil will go into his ear shortly steven <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> will be kicking off for the seattle seahawks and new england will start on offense, as back to receive the kick is <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> the game is a tossup both teams are terrific pete carroll always enjoying the moment <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, what kind of a day will he have? but hes gonna start with skittles so nothing else is new &gt;&gt; [ chuckles ] &gt;&gt; might as well just be a preseason game in august for him <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> ready to go to work injured his elbow <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person>, the dislocated shoulder, but both will play today, as <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> gets ready to kick off super bowl xlix under way in glendale, arizona well start with a runback by <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> from 5 yards deep and to the 18yard line he comes, and thats where new england will set up shop <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> he said to us yesterday, after whats been going on over the last two weeks, he said, "there would not be a game i would want to win more than this one" &gt;&gt; no shortage of red meat in front of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> for this one, is there? &gt;&gt; he has shane vereen as his running back meanwhile, now youve got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> flanked way out to the right, near the sideline <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> on him <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> starts from the shotgun thats <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> in short motion and the first play is a pass to the outside its caught near the sideline, but only a minimal gain now for <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> making the tackle second and long brady, sixth super bowl start hes thrown 197 passes in those games 1,277 through the air all super bowl records three wins, two losses and one of those losses came here after the 07 season, to spoil the perfect season, as the new york giants did them in <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> is now in the backfield second down and 8 this is <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> coming in motion short drop pass caught on the outside breaking a tackle and coming up about 2 yards shy of the first down is amendola, as he gets away from <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> and that will set up a third down and 2 for the patriots &gt;&gt; well, clearly one of the things we talked about right off the bat is, how can you handle these pass rushers? thats one way get them on the ground with some quick throws and then its <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> on the outside we have to keep an eye on that elbow will he be able to tackle? will he be able to jam the receivers the way that he typically can? &gt;&gt; in that green bay game, it looked like he was playing with an invisible sling third and 2 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> good, clean pocket throws and thatll be the games first first down, as vereen shane vereen makes the catch, and hes tackled there by the outside linebacker, <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> &gt;&gt; one of the things thats very difficult when you play against the patriots if you clear zones, you have to handle the likes of <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> and shane vereen with inside linebackers their quickness very tough to deal with &gt;&gt; new england can beat you either way in the divisional game against baltimore, 53 passes, and then 40 runs against indianapolis this is <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> the seahawks expect them to be more balanced the patriots today so here is <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> he was a patriot last year he scored four touchdowns in a playoff game against indianapolis then he signs with pittsburgh doesnt like his role there because leveon bell was clearly the numberone back walks off the field before the end of a game in november, and then winds up signing, after he cleared waivers, with new england so he returns home, and he is their stud right now because jonas gray, their other running back, is inactive tonight second down and 8 and heres <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> gets it up to the 35yard line <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wright</person> makes the defense the seattle defense becoming legendary right now their ranks this year fewest points allowed, fewest yards allowed, third against the rush, tops against the pass and theyve been doing this for the last three seasons third and 6 dan quinn, the defensive coordinator, who in the next 36 hours or so will be announced as the head coach of the atlanta falcons but first things first for him here, as new england comes up spread out five receivers play clock is down to :02 third and 6 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> able to survey throws low and incomplete so they got one first down, and now theyll have to punt byron maxwell covering vereen and seattle will get the ball &gt;&gt; one of the things thats so important for the patriots in this game is to force these defensive ends to run the loop go all the way around <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and then try and secure it up front to make sure that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> can step up that time, a little antsy in the pocket got rid of it quickly missed the throw &gt;&gt; <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">ryan allen</person> the leftfooted punter good, high, deep punt flag is down as its taken at the 15yard line jeron johnson came in and may have run into the kicker if he ran into the kicker, if its the 5yard variety, its still not going to be a first down bill vinovich will make the call if thats a 5yard penalty, it would be fourth down and 1 roughing the kicker is a first down big call here &gt;&gt; i think he got his plant foot &gt;&gt; running into the kicker kicking team, number 23 5yard penalty still fourth down &gt;&gt; all right, so thats the garden variety, as it were, which means that the line of scrimmage will now be the 40yard line and another look here &gt;&gt; the rule is, if you hit the plant leg this leg thats supposed to be 15 yards i dont see running into the kicker right there &gt;&gt; first down timeout &gt;&gt; well, jeron johnson, he can smile right now, but he got away with one had it been roughing the kicker, it would have been a 15yard penalty and a first down here it is again, cris &gt;&gt; so the nonkicking leg when you hit that leg, thats 15 yards and an automatic first down without question bill vinovichs call, and he missed it &gt;&gt; so it would have been fourth and 1 new england declines the penalty theyll take the play that was a 49yard punt the ball is at the 16yard line and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> carries "beast mode" up to the 20yard line before hes tackled by half of the state of massachusetts <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> when he faces super bowlwinning quarterbacks his career now three years old hes 100, including a win against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> when these two teams last met in seattle, early in the season in 2012 seattle won the game, coming from behind, and wilson said, "that really got us going" he had a good year in 12 of course they won the super bowl last year, and this year nfc champs again second and 7 stack three receivers to the left wilson had to reach down for the snap and thats <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> picking up a couple about 2 yards shy of the first third down and short &gt;&gt; one of the things that weve seen is sometimes when max unger, the center, is moving to his left, the snaps go to the right they had an issue with that in the championship game, and here we go with the early snap with the same issue &gt;&gt; thats of particular import theyre trying to run the read option can throw all the timing off &gt;&gt; no doubt &gt;&gt; third and 2 they go four wide here and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> is going to get stacked up and stopped so after seattle gets that break and gets the ball after what should have been roughing, its a threeandout and theyll get the ball back &gt;&gt; big vince wilfork right here you need your superstars to play huge in the super bowl there you go he stands him up it looks like hes benchpressing <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> off of him he makes contact those huge arms, he extends them out, gains control, and makes a big play &gt;&gt; <person player="jon ryan" race="white" position="P">jon ryan</person> to punt it was ryan who was holding on a fake field goal that turned into a touchdown when they were down 160 to green bay that was a humongous play in that game nose down with a lot of backspin fairly short kick fair catch called for and made by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> bill belichick, no 2 pencil at the ready at least hes not wearing the flipflops that he wore all week long hes got his sneakers on today &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] formal wear &gt;&gt; quite a scene at media day <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to work starts from the gun from the 32 pressure put on vereen, with some help out in front takes it out to the 35yard line thats a short gain keep an eye, cris, obviously on <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person>, who got banged up in practice the other day hurt his knee and wearing a brace &gt;&gt; and hes not a speed player anyway hes essentially, as bill belichick calls him, a linebacker, hes so close to the line of scrimmage but he is the hammer on the back end, the guy that delivers those big hits and you just have to wonder now, if he does get in mancoverage situations, will he be the same? &gt;&gt; <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> plays down low <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> plays deep theyve got develin in at fullback the fake to blount, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> flips it to the side for a first down <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> taken out there by byron maxwell &gt;&gt; and this is exactly the kind of game that the new england patriots and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> wants to play here you have to get the ball out of your hands quickly whenever you play against seattle as a matter of fact, seattle in practice this week, at 23 seconds, the coaches blew the whistle they said, "you will not have any more time than that to get to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>" &gt;&gt; 8:12 left in the opening quarter patriots line up <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> at tackle as eligible they did that 28 times in the afc championship game and a nice little hole here exploited by blount, taking it across the 50 to the 49yard line and that will make it second down and 5 for the pats &gt;&gt; <person player="ryan wendell" race="white" position="C">ryan wendell</person>, one of their best run blockers, is gonna lead the way on the power play here and this is what the patriots are hoping to do the buzz word for them this week was "control" "we have to control the game" theyre hoping for 30, 35 runs in this game with <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> &gt;&gt; and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> in again now youve got develin as the fullback he scored a touchdown in the championship game <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> says something to develin at the end, as the snap from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> and he gets gangtackled as he reaches the 48yard line itll be third down and 3 tony mcdaniel right in the middle for the tackle <person player="josh kline" race="UNK" position="OG">josh</person> mcdaniels is the offensive coordinator he had been in new england remember, went to denver, that didnt work out went to st louis for a little while now back as the offensive coordinator we thought he would be much in demand with the coaching vacancies, and he was, but he has chosen to stay in new england, at least for another year third and 3 brady, a quick toss inside slant can <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> get the first down? he can <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> is there to make the tackle needed 3, got 4 first down, new england &gt;&gt; <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> on the inside, just gonna run out here and there is a collision and a first down <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> never even got a chance to find the laces on that one he didnt care he found the big guy, number 87 one of the things we knew was going to happen is that they were going to challenge <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> with that spin move inside two years ago, 2012, they played, chris clemons had a lot of success against <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> with that move &gt;&gt; <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> in motion to the outside <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> identifying the "mike," or middle linebacker <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> flips it again to the outside vereen shane vereen to the 40 boy, its been a merrygoround at running back for the patriots this year they started with stevan ridley he got hurt then vereen then jonas gray came on and was spectacular for a while missed a meeting, and then they benched him and put in <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> &gt;&gt; there goes vereen out but watch after he catches this ball, how everybody comes down three guys right there to make the tackle one of the big points of emphasis in this game is no yards after the catch if they can tackle like that all day, theyll be fine here &gt;&gt; <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> sets up on the right side for leverage and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> fighting his way, trying to pick up those extra 2 yards to get the first hes about a half yard shy, as he takes it inside the 35yard line it will be third and 1 &gt;&gt; that was the question in this game which of these big backs could control the game? <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person>? the patriots say, "were a longdrive team weve got to be able to string these together like this" and so far in this one, they are &gt;&gt; ofttimes <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> likes to sneak, but normally its when they get to the line earlier than this third and 1 hands it to <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> swings to the outside turns the corner picks up the first down <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> takes it to the 25yard line <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> with that dislocated shoulder he told us he couldnt have played if this game had been last week makes the stop &gt;&gt; bounce out all the way theyre going to come with the fullback, develin, here, whos gonna get that outside edge it looked like an inside run, but the whole way that was intended to go out on the edge and there was byron maxwell, jumped inside, and picked up a big first down &gt;&gt; patriots, four first downs in the game seattle, none they had a threeandout simple play through the middle not much there taking it to the 24yard line through the middle is <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> in postseason play, the seattle defense, which is spectacular, but in the regular season, as you can see, third in the league, but in the two postseason games, and those would be the games against carolina and against green bay, and eddie lacy had a big first three quarters 133 1/2 second down and 8 from the 24 the fake to <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> the pass to <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> and he has a first down <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> makes his second catch &gt;&gt; so far theyre completely neutralizing the rush of seattle here we go just right out in the flat looked like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gave a little look inside <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> bit on that and so far, this drive could not be going any better for <person player="josh kline" race="UNK" position="OG">josh</person> mcdaniels, the offensive coordinator exactly what he hoped for be able to pound it, quick passes &gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has missed only one pass 8 of his first 9 the ball is at the 14 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> again protected well throws to the outside, to the 10yard line that will be about a 4yard gain as <person player="michael hoomanawanui" race="UNK" position="TE">hoomanawanui</person> makes the catch in the red zone, the new england patriots, theyve been inside the 20yard line on 10 occasions, have scored 9 touchdowns and youre talking about brady, cris look, most quarterbacks, obviously, would be better in a clean pocket, but tom, the difference between him in a clean pocket and getting contacted is enormous &gt;&gt; yeah, its easy to have a clean pocket when youre throwing it after about a second and a half &gt;&gt; right part of the game plan second and 6 and stuffed in the backfield <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> thats <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person>, number 72, a guy who, in what is pretty much a standard type of defense that lets the guys just do their jobs, hes the one guy who moves around on the line &gt;&gt; right there will play all five defensive line positions and its his quickness that is the biggest concern for bill belichick and the new england patriots he is a guy that they are going to try and doubleteam and hit on a secondary shot from the center or somebody else because his quickness creates real problems &gt;&gt; theyve had the ball 7 1/2 minutes half the quarter third and 6 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> dancing and it is picked at the 5yard line <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person>! still on the run tripped up pete carroll right there to salute him so the drive ends on a third and 6 as <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> picks it off and hes down theyve wrapped up his left arm thats the first interception, regular season or postseason, in his three years, but he pays the price, as he gets carted back to the locker room <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> under some pressure that time that was a 13play, 58yard drive it took 7:41 ends with a pick &gt;&gt; hard to believe that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> just made that mistake under pressure, yes, but really just threw that one up &gt;&gt; new englands run 19 plays, seattles run 3 all of them runs by <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> this time it is wilson looking downfield takes care of <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">ninkovich</person> with a good fake and there he goes sliding to a stop at the 21yard line and thats where <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> can really kill you, not only with his arm, but with his legs and back we go to the interception &gt;&gt; here comes <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> schofields gonna go down inside watch how long <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> waits wait, wait, wait here he comes and now attacks <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> as soon as <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> sees him, he basically tried to just lean back a little bit, and threw it right into the arms of <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> huge mistake &gt;&gt; second down and 3 wilson yet to throw a pass heres <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> and look at <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> so typical of <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> turns his shoulders they call him a splitlegged runner you see how hes built powerful knocks over people has had some of the greatest runs weve seen in the last five years first down here &gt;&gt; yeah, in the last four years, no one has more rushing yards, 100yard games, or rushing touchdowns than this guy they call him beast mode, and you see why these are large human beings, and they simply cannot get him on the ground you see it game after game that we do &gt;&gt; now wilson with five receivers just a threeman rush from new england and a spy on wilson has time cant get any pressure on him there he goes again looking for the first down, but coming up to make the tackle is darrelle revis and that is a very fast first quarter that has just come to an end back to glendale al michaels, cris collinsworth, michele tafoya there are your numbers through the first quarter new england had that long drive, and that was ended when <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> picked off the pass thats the one turnover you know, we talked to pete carroll yesterday before we talk about that, lets go to michele for an injury update &gt;&gt; you mentioned <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> it was a costly interception, al he is doubtful with a leftwrist injury he has gone back for xrays you saw him carted back to the locker room but that may be the only play he makes tonight, al &gt;&gt; thank you, michele hit by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> at the end of the play second down and 12 heres <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> you know, cris, we talked to pete carroll yesterday i said, "you think this starts like the haglerhearns fight where the guys come out and just try to kill each other at the outset, or is this more like youre parrying, youre trying to feel your way through?" thats the way its started &gt;&gt; yeah, these two great coaches, they want to see what the other one is going to do and weve seen it in super bowls before somehow bill belichick has a way of playing it a little bit close to the vest but thats a huge miss right there when youre playing against a defense like that, you cant turn it over when points are sitting there for you &gt;&gt; third and 9, with five receivers out there wilson is under some pressure but there he is escaping and surveying now hell go back the other way he gets a nice block and the pass is incomplete downfield, intended for <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">bryan</person> walters so nobody could get open pressure was put on fourth and 9 &gt;&gt; well, heres the key the patriots are going all mantoman coverage look, across the board theres revis right there on <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> thats going to be his match throughout the course of the day the receivers are scrambling around, trying to make a play there just was absolutely nobody open anywhere and for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>, he really needs to find a little rhythm throwing the ball, but so far this coverage too much &gt;&gt; 0 for 1 is wilson the other play was a sack revis got credit for a sack on the play that ended the first quarter now the kick here by <person player="jon ryan" race="white" position="P">jon ryan</person> <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> short kick fields at the 34 does a little dancing to the outside tackled, after a runback of 2, by <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock coyle</person> late afternoon here at the university of phoenix stadium darrell bevell going over things with <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> starts this drive from the 35yard line <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> is the back an errant snap, but he collects it and then hits amendola, whos now caught three and thats a first down before <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> runs him into the patriot bench &gt;&gt; well, weve seen <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> have an early impact on this game from several different places dan connolly unable to get his hands on him then in the run game, <person player="ryan wendell" race="white" position="C">ryan wendell</person>, who cant block him and then the stunt, where hes going to come all the way around and this pressure leads to the big interception &gt;&gt; that was a gain of 17 on the last play good play fake, good play action, but good coverage on the other side incomplete <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person> makes a nice play <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person>, the intended receiver and <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> is in for lane, who is most likely done for the day, so there is your new nickel and, boy, that legion of boom right now lane, who is kind of a supporting actor, is out youve got the elbow for <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> you got chancellors knee and you have thomas shoulder &gt;&gt; and simons got a brace there its that time of year, al you just have to strap it on and go play &gt;&gt; vereen is the back in this set there goes <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> out of the slot brady, quick flip over the middle caught thats <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> had a nice year came over from carolina played four years there, was an unrestricted free agent that will make it third down and 3 &gt;&gt; heres the changeup right here now you see whats called a bull rush they set him up with the spin move inside, <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> theyve been outside and that time, they try to go right down the middle so far, <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person>s holding up well &gt;&gt; solder, the only firstround draft choice starting for the patriot offense third and 3 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> out of the pocket and he connects here that will be a first down vereen to the outside and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> said, "ugh!" clapping his hands should have stopped him, couldnt first down &gt;&gt; heres whats happening, al they are just basically you know, in basketball, you clear a zone, you let a michael jordan or somebody go oneonone? its the same sort of thing thats happening here shane vereen, theyre clearing out a zone, letting him get into a zone with one of those linebackers, and just try and make some adjustments, get him the ball and allow him to break a tackle and pick up a first down &gt;&gt; surgical <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> on the outside, lined up at the bottom against <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> brady, good play fake, good time deepest pass of the day for him and its incomplete <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> with some contact at the end of the play, but there is no flag it will be second down and 10 &gt;&gt; thats a good sign for seahawk fans because heres <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person>s first shot running down the field against <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> almost came back underneath and made the play but so many times we see this new england offense really get a jump start when <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> starts to get into the game, and so far, not a factor &gt;&gt; in all of bradys super bowls three wins, two losses on passes that hes thrown more than 20 yards from the line of scrimmage, hes 1 for 22 so hes been great on the short stuff here he hands the ball off on second down it goes to shane vereen to the 35yard line gain of 1 itll be third down &gt;&gt; well, some of the quickness now starting to show up and for pete carroll, he has to be so proud of his defense you think of what they did in that championship game against green bay, surviving all those turnovers and here comes <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> again, inside, flying through there even when theyre on the back side, you have to be ready for that quickness &gt;&gt; third and 9 this will be the 26th play run by new england seattle has run 8 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> protected again throws caught on the run by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> hell take the ball to about the 10yard line <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> gets free over the middle on a thirdand9 play, thats 23 yards &gt;&gt; so the injury showing up already here now <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> would be in that position now its <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person> and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> too quick so you wondered whether or not they would attack down the field against the <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person>s clearly, they have not tried to do any of that but these inside routes, the quickness of those two guys shane vereen, <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> now showing up &gt;&gt; so the second deep surge by new england the first ended with the interception and this is <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> going nowhere gain of 1 to the 11yard line it will be second down and 9 &gt;&gt; weve got our first little tackleeligible play here of course, that was a big part of the conversation earlier so you get <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> in there he would have been eligible that ones just sort of a bluff will they come back and have some sort of a play where hes eligible, receivers ineligible? weve seen them all from <person player="josh kline" race="UNK" position="OG">josh</person> mcdaniels &gt;&gt; yes, we have fleming over two dozen times reporting as eligible against indianapolis second and 9 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws caught! lafell, touchdown! <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person>, from carolina to new england as a free agent, makes the catch, and new england strikes first &gt;&gt; going right after <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person> you knew it was gonna happen hard slant inside, and then watch the tail end of this play it is <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> that comes over, and <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> ends up holding his arm or shoulder after taking the brunt of that hit they dont have many corners left to play, so they need all these guys to stay healthy &gt;&gt; <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> for the extra point so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> puts <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> in the crosshairs its the grand canyon state one of the younger states, obviously the 48th state only hawaii and alaska have been in the union a shorter period of time <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> ready to come back out nine first downs for new england, one for seattle total plays, 288 <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> to kick off and <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> will move to his right and just let it flop out of the end zone 9:47 left in the half wilson ready to take over raised the lombardi trophy last year and told us when he put it down, all he could think about was doing it again next year well, here is next year, and hes going to get sacked again for the second time at the 18yard line <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> comes in to take him down to make it second down and 12 &gt;&gt; i dont know exactly what happens here, but <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell okung</person> is gonna pull out, and <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> is going to end up on the guard, <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james</person> carpenter <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, when he was coming out for the route, kind of knocked carpenter off so, so far here, <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> has gotten nothing going at all sort of like the beginning of the championship game against green bay 0 for 4 in that one, four interceptions until four minutes to go in the game, a quarterback rating of 7 &gt;&gt; wilson hasnt completed a pass bradys completed 14 to the 21yard line goes <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> tackled there by <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> setting up a third down and long make it third and 8 &gt;&gt; one of the really interesting moves here, theyre bringing <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> here to the middle of the field because they wanted to be able to go sideline to sideline with him the feeling was that not only could he end up sniffing out the runs of <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, but if <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> starts to get loose on the edge, he could run him down, as well a very significant player in this game, <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> &gt;&gt; 8 1/2 left in the half third and 8 wilson going deep down the sideline and broken up <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person>, the nickel, knocked it away from <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> and its another quick threeandout for the seahawks &gt;&gt; youre gonna ask me what the story line of this game has been so far? i will tell you the utter domination in man coverage of the patriots coverage people all over the place theres been nowhere to throw this football ive been watching it on almost every play there just is nothing there theyre spying, theyre taking care of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> in case he wants to run, and the coverage people down the field are winning &gt;&gt; game is almost 22 minutes old, and wilson has not completed a pass <person player="jon ryan" race="white" position="P">jon ryan</person> good, deep beautiful kick fielded at the 17 by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> runs into his own man and then runs out of room, and hes taken out of bounds at about the 27yard line its the old adage, defense wins super bowls theres a list of the teams that led the league in fewest points and yards allowed and only the chiefs in the last super bowl before the aflnfl merger would have lost, but they lost to the nfl s numberone defense, as the vikings were number one they were the team that lost to the kansas city chiefs back in super bowl iv, and then the merger took place the next year &gt;&gt; defense cant win anything, though, if your offense isnt doing anything on their side 14022, the total yards &gt;&gt; crazy &gt;&gt; goodness gracious &gt;&gt; theyve got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> outside <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> is on the slot to the left will they start to pick on <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> again? <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> now sets up on the left side hes got three guys coming out of the left side looks that way, and has it batted down at the line of scrimmage its tony mcdaniel, 67", 305, out of tennessee, batting it second and 10 &gt;&gt; yeah, and i think thats a good strategy because now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has got them so frustrated with these quick throws, youre not seeing the pass rushers of seattle even making moves theyre basically having to just go push into the offensive linemen and then try to get their hands up because theres no way theyre gonna get there &gt;&gt; three receivers are set on the left side again <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> checking the middle throws cutting over the middle is <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> they tackle him itll be third down and 3 <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, the middle linebacker who was so instrumental in the success of this team when he got healthy, makes the stop &gt;&gt; all right, heres <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> right here and what theyre doing is theyre running shane vereen out of the backfield then theyre running the tight end or slot on that side up the seam so all theyre doing is clearing out an entire zone and leaving <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> oneonone with <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, and they are winning the game with that strategy &gt;&gt; third and 3 vereen motion to the inside <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> escaping turns the shoulders, and the pass is deflected and incomplete so its fourth down &gt;&gt; looked like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was looking down the field, and his receiver got knocked down, so he basically just tried to hold on to it he saw his receiver on the ground couldnt tell who that was maybe <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> every receivers on the ground <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> kind of ran into each other <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> said, "i better not throw this one" &gt;&gt; thats the first threeandout <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">ryan allen</person> to punt <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">bryan</person> walters set to run it back and it bounces at the 29yard line &gt;&gt; whos here? well, john travolta there he is kevin hart sitting next to will ferrell a few jokes in that luxury suite <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> wahlberg loves his new england teams kenny chesney looking on steven <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler</person> is also a huge patriot fan and we have royalty, as well from liverpool <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> mccartney now, from the 30 they start this drive, do the seahawks, with <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> with some tough running always tough running from <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn</person> up to the 35yard line gain of 5 matt patricia is the defensive coordinator hes done a great job and one of these guys one of these guys who maybe next year will be in line to be interviewed for a headcoaching spot &gt;&gt; so many of these runs of <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, when they start left, they go back right and the patriots are kind of crashing in from that side and trying to take away that cutback lane, and its been working pretty well so far &gt;&gt; see what happens here this time, straight ahead but just backs his way for an extra yard, yard and a half to set up a third down and short &gt;&gt; <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">donta hightower</person>, right here, the big guy in the middle just going to try to come in there, and theyre just trying to occupy every single <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> that there is just dont allow that big guy to get started, because when he starts with those jump cuts, hightower, <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person>, none of them are gonna get him &gt;&gt; third down, a yard and a half and a whistle here weve had a penaltyfree game we had one penalty, and it was declined bill vinovich will finally take the mike &gt;&gt; false start offense, number 82 5yard penalty still second down &gt;&gt; so a third and 1 becomes a third and 6 thats <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke willson</person>, 82, the tight end thats the secondlongest into a game without a completion new england in super bowl xx, going all the way back that was against the 85 bears they got their first completion with five minutes to go in the half we have 5:44 here, but a third down and 6 now from the 34yard line to the outside caught can he get the first down? well, well see where they spot it theyre going to give him a pretty good spot here, as browner is able to tackle <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> and theyre going to spot it right at the 40, and that will be a first down &gt;&gt; and desperately needed here at the top of the screen, going against brandon browner of course, former member of the legion of boom does he get that thing turned over? i think he does pretty good spot there and that was a big one you get the penalty, you get knocked back from a third and 1, and finally <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> steps up and makes a play &gt;&gt; so <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> catches wilsons first completion and now <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> to the 45 you look at these seattle receivers, cris, its a funny group they dont get a lot of headlines none of them were drafted none remember last year, they had golden tate he went to detroit they had percy harvin they thought he would be a star this year for them, and then he ran his way out of seattle, and they traded him to the new york jets <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person>, a rookie, got hurt so all five of the guys who are receivers are free agents &gt;&gt; and they get upset when anybody says negative things about them but heres their moment this is when theyre gonna have to win the game and <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">luke willson</person> needs to help, as well &gt;&gt; the fake wilson, who has got a great arm downfield, turning and making the catch! twisting and turning is <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> another of those free agents a guy who has played very little offense this year, but the guy who recovered that onside kick that was so huge in the nfc championship game &gt;&gt; and hes a big guy, al remember watching in practice the other day, how great <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> was at throwing the deep ball? finally now he gets one completion, they take a shot and now the substitution is happening and the referees are holding up play so they cant get that quick snap &gt;&gt; they race to the line heres <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> takes the ball to the 7 as the crowd chants "beast" at least the seattle portion another look at the catch by <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, who did not catch a pass this season &gt;&gt; look at that how about that one? arrington all over him, in perfect coverage but the one thing i love watching with <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> not only does he throw the deep ball well, but he throws them high he has enough strength in his arm to get it up high so a big, tall receiver like <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> can go up and get it &gt;&gt; <person player="will tukuafu" race="UNK" position="DT">tukuafu</person> is now in the game at fullback to provide leverage for <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> here goes <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> to the left side he gets it down to the 2yard line <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> makes the tackle it will be third down and a long yard &gt;&gt; i tell you what, <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> just took the helmet right off of <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james</person> carpenter on that one there is some fights going on inside in this football game this is just man on man here we go right here i mean, this is up and down the line you can almost pick out any battle you want to see hightower, <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person>, <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> its like that all the way up and down this line &gt;&gt; third and 2 from the 3 wilson to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> touchdown! <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, who led the league in touchdowns this season with 17 13 on the ground its all set up by the pass to <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> and were an extra point away from a tie game &gt;&gt; once you get vince wilfork contained they get the doubleteam on him, and then weve seen it so many times <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, you give him a little space they hit the big pass, and now the running game finally opens up and seattle, after doing nothing, answers in a big way &gt;&gt; you got a little brawl helmets flying off on just about every play &gt;&gt; we got a super bowl going now &gt;&gt; yep &gt;&gt; and just like green bay, you wonder, does it come back to haunt them in some way, not being able to convert early in this game? &gt;&gt; mmhmm meanwhile, <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">donta hightower</person> got hurt, and hes being assisted off the field theres the linebacker, right there back to the bench he goes 2:16 left in a very, very fast first half a lot of that has to do with the fact weve had only one accepted penalty and one declined penalty &gt;&gt; well, if youre a patriots fan, <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">donta hightower</person> could not be more significant in this football game because of <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> battling a shoulder injury for much of the season that was a 70yard, 8play drive six rushes, two passes extra point by <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> is good looking down through the hole in the roof, the retractable roof they grow the grass outside and then wheel it in the grass is grown in alabama bunch of trucks brought it in &gt;&gt; home of? &gt;&gt; here you go home of ken stabler foley, alabama &gt;&gt; there you go &gt;&gt; down by the gulf so, so much made about the footballs and where theyd be and under lock and key and theyve been well taken care of there they are all of them 125 to 135 pounds cris, i was thinking, you knew neil armstrong not since armstrong stepped on the moon have more astrophysicists been interviewed on television than this week &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; i think we know all we ever need to know about pounds per square inch &gt;&gt; i tell you, that was an interesting day with the patriots this week, though, wasnt it? &gt;&gt; oh, yeah &gt;&gt; i could not have been more direct with my questioning of bill belichick, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, robert kraft they all absolutely denied any knowledge, any involvement, any possibility, anything they said could have led to intentionally deflating those balls &gt;&gt; you saw robert and jonathan kraft investigation is ongoing bob kraft put all of his chips on the table when he said he wanted an apology from the league when they found out there was nothing there meanwhile, amendola, before he steps out of bounds, picks up the first down at the 31yard line so it all started you all know it i mean, unless you were, i dont know, someplace, some other planet, but the deflated footballs which they discovered at halftime in the indianapolis game, and all of the wackiness and craziness that led up to tonight quarterback comparison weird numbers <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> with a lot of short stuff and then the one pass to <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> got them into the end zone and then wilson did not complete a pass until that last drive had the 6yarder to <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> and then the 44yarder to <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> just two completions, but that set up <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> to get into the end zone thus at the 2minute warning, we are knotted at 7 &gt;&gt; this is when the patriots are at their best they led the nfl with 66 points in the final 2 minutes of the first half lets see what they can do here &gt;&gt; and they have all of their timeouts starting the drive from the 31yard line begin on the ground <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> avoiding tacklers fighting his way for a first down gets to the 41yard line see where theyre going to <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> it, though theyre going to <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> it a little bit short inches short second and inches &gt;&gt; theyve been starting a lot of these drives with <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> in at tight end that time they ran right behind him great drive start &gt;&gt; second and inches <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> flips it quickly that converts vereen gets taken down <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, the linebacker, covering him on the outside first down &gt;&gt; thats what theyve been doing theyve been taking vereen right out of the backfield and then working him wide and creating some space inside, so that time they finally throw it to him &gt;&gt; ticking down to a minute <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> good protection deep on the outside and over the head and incomplete of <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> byron maxwell covering second and 10 for the patriots patriots, 66 points in the final 2 minutes of the first half &gt;&gt; al, you want to know why <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> hasnt been much of a factor were starting to see some of these lurk coverages where <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> now is walking down into the middle of the field with really no responsibility number 31 and so if <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> comes on one of those crossing routes, hes right there to pick it up &gt;&gt; the defense crowding the line, as shermans going to go to the outside, mirroring edelman, who gets it, and then hes just tripped up after a short gain you had <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> going across the formation and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> following him &gt;&gt; the old jet sweep, right? you just turn around, and its right there and then <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person>, as athletic as he is, he just cant react to it that quickly nice to have somebody like a <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> on your team that can do so many things of course, one of the big plays of this playoff run was his touchdown pass on that double pass to <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> &gt;&gt; in the game against baltimore, where they erased two 14point deficits third and 3 oh! and jumping across and they whistle it dead because he could have gone unabated to the quarterback was <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person> so hes offside and that is a free first down &gt;&gt; neutralzone infraction, defense, number 56 5yard penalty still third down &gt;&gt; it just doesnt get worse than that when youre in a third and less than 5, everybody on that defensive line should be yelling, "dont jump, dont jump, dont jump!" and then its the veteran, <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person>, who was so big, i thought, in the game against peyton manning last year but really has been a nonfactor so far here &gt;&gt; seahawks were the most penalized team in the league this season and their opponents drew fewer penalties it was like a 2to1 ratio for the seahawks this year, their penalties against the opposition costly one there the ball at the 44 first down <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> low throw, but caught off the shoe tops of shane vereen, who gets the ball to the 26yard line new england with all of its timeouts, and they will elect to use their first right here &gt;&gt; there we go, out of the backfield again, clear the space, clear the zone oneonone route just let them go to work theyre dropping down <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> that time in the middle of the field, but he just couldnt quite get there youre going to win that battle against a linebacker like <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, but <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> kind of got picked off and might have been able to get there &gt;&gt; coming up on the toyota halftime report, the guys will break down the first half, tell you what each team needs to do in the second half two coaches who certainly know how to make adjustments coming up on the toyota halftime bill belichick hes won more postseason games than any coach in history 21 20 of those with the patriots you forget he won one of those with the <person player="asante cleveland" race="UNK" position="TE">cleveland</person> browns coached there for five years and went to new england in 2000 you got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> matched up with <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> at the bottom of the screen and the pass is flipped to the outside for a short gain vereen gets shoved out of bounds and it will be second down &gt;&gt; you know, one of the problems is, if they keep going to these quick plays, you have the option, if youre seattle, to maybe bring in some extra corners, but because of the injury to <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person>, really, its <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person> theyre all out there on the field already so options limited so right now the patriots saying, "were going to stay with this spreadout look and all these receivers because we like the defensive backs on the field right now that they have" &gt;&gt; meanwhile, you have <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> you can see him hes in the slot and bradys going to throw deep down the right side for <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and a touchdown! and the earthquake spike see, youve got the linebacker covering him and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is able to haul it in <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> couldnt hang with him 22 yards for the score &gt;&gt; al, its amazing, is that the patriots knew coming into this game that if <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> walked out, he was gonna be about 8 yards off and way inside, and that signaled man coverage it always signals man coverage when theyre in there there was no doubt at the snap of the ball where that one was going <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> against <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person>, a mismatch chancellor, maybe that one wont work &gt;&gt; 1:45 they went 80 yards in eight plays <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> for the extra point well, that would figure most career td passes in a super bowl joe montana and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> each with 11 two tonight for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> &gt;&gt; had the one mistake early, and since then has been razor sharp, hasnt he? &gt;&gt; mmhmm 20 of 27, 177 a lot of short stuff, but twice hes gone long and its paid off for him <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> &gt;&gt; amazing that the big interception by <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> could have actually turned the game in favor of the patriots he goes out, and all of a sudden they dont seem to be quite the coverage team &gt;&gt; great point lose a guy like that try to work around it and now this will be out of the back of the end zone so with 31 seconds, they have all of their timeouts not that theyll be able to get them in with 31 seconds, but lets see if wilson can get them into fieldgoal range &gt;&gt; <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> right there handled the spin move pretty much and then on the other side, <person player="sebastian vollmer" race="white" position="OT">sebastian vollmer</person> going against <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> but the ball is out of there so quickly, he knew presnap all he was going to do was look off the safety it was so easy to read the coverage and the one thing about the seahawks is, they dont change they never change you know which coverage theyre in, and i dont think they care &gt;&gt; robert turbin now in the game wilson hes gonna give it to turbin and turbins gonna get free and take it out to the 39 its a 19yard gain seattle will take a timeout here meanwhile, back to the last drive, cris, how big was the jumping offside of <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person>? that was a third down and 3 at that point &gt;&gt; yeah, i mean, you dont know i mean, is it possible that they would have picked it up anyway? possibly but one thing you do not want to do is make anything too easy on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> &gt;&gt; so, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, 20 of 27 after the wackiest two weeks of his career 37 we all know the story drafted in the sixth round he was the 199th pick got a chance to start in 2001 when drew bledsoe got hurt in a game against the jets that was belichicks second year and the rest is history and hes written most of it 24 seconds from the 39 now wilson getting away and wilson is out of bounds at the 45yard line so now you have 17 seconds <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> is their fieldgoal kicker good range, but <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> did miss three field goals in this stadium against arizona in december &gt;&gt; <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person>, one of the most athletic defenders the patriots have, could not get a hand on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and the sad part about it is, all the patriots have been talking about this week, in the final 2 minutes of the half or the game, or in big moments, believe me, <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>s gonna pull the ball down and run with it, and they still let him get out &gt;&gt; 17 seconds they need about 10 yards or so and either a timeout or out of bounds wilson rolling away and then he has to throw it away so now you get down to the math you got 11 seconds you can still use all of the field because you have the timeouts hauschkas had a good year, but hauschka, as i said we did a sundaynight game here in december, and he missed three field goals &gt;&gt; and only missed six all year you just wonder golf, right? theres a few holes, you stand there on the tee, and you go, "im not feeling too good about this one" wonder if it happens to fieldgoal kickers, too &gt;&gt; happened right here to tiger woods on thursday and friday, didnt it? &gt;&gt; sure did &gt;&gt; second and 10 now wilson throwing and that will be caught and that will set them up for a field goal but a flag here <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">ricardo lockette</person> makes the catch but its the first time weve had a flag in the secondary if its holding against the defense, theyll decline that, put them into fieldgoal range 6 seconds you had &gt;&gt; personal foul, face mask defense, number 25 that penalty will be added onto the end of the run, half the distance to the goal automatic first down &gt;&gt; so thats at the end of the run it gets tacked on so, if youre the seahawks, do you dare? i mean, you have 6 seconds i dont think you can afford it what do you think, partner? to go for it? &gt;&gt; i think you want to make sure you get these 3 points out of here but its interesting, al, that youve got we talked about these receivers it has been basically the backups, <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">ricardo lockette</person> and <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, who have made the plays here in the first half &gt;&gt; so the fieldgoal unit came out now the offense comes out now they call a timeout so, i mean, if you think about it to run a play in 6 seconds? and then you run the risk of nothing left on the clock and you are going to get the ball seattle will to start the second half &gt;&gt; well, and ill tell you this, as well the patriots arent a bunch of dummies so youre over there with 6 seconds they know what you got to do you either got to throw a slant you got to throw something where you catch it and throw it so now do you want to take a chance against bill belichick and matt patricias defense, of sort of tipping your hand as to what youre going to do in this situation? theyre gonna try it &gt;&gt; very risky very fascinating &gt;&gt; obviously, you cant take a sack cant scramble around its got to be a catch and throw, and im gonna guess <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>s been told, "unless it is perfect, throw it away" &gt;&gt; this is like the nba catchandshoot time get it, and get rid of it so pete carroll going against the grain, all things considered 6 seconds thats the key here wilson lining up in the shotgun and now new england is going to take a timeout &gt;&gt; second charged timeout, new england &gt;&gt; so they took a look at that set and now wilson will come over and discuss things with the guys on the sideline little recap of the game <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> with that big interception to stymie the drive, but then he got hurt <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, who didnt catch a pass all season, a 44yard reception, setting up a <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> score then <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> beats <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person>, hauls it in from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and we get to 147 in that manner &gt;&gt; you know, if you are going to take a shot here, you would think maybe <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> heres a guy thats 65", 218 pounds, redzone threat throw it up, give him a chance going against one of these smaller corners &gt;&gt; well see you got <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">lockette</person> and <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> going to the right &gt;&gt; theres <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> at the bottom &gt;&gt; <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> outside <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> in the slot hes got to get rid of it in a hurry and he does and its caught! touchdown! <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> how crazy another one of the seattle free agents you dont even hear about him until he recovers the onside kick against green bay tonight, a 44yard reception, and here a touchdown reception what a gutsy call &gt;&gt; yeah, and you go, okay, <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> is the fourth receiver, and <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> is your fourth corner but the size differential alone at that moment said maybe <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> should be the numberone guy that we cover here what a great call there by pete carroll &gt;&gt; extra point is good so instead of it being 1410, or 147, each team with a touchdown in the final 2:14 and were knotted at 14 &gt;&gt; all <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> had time to do was catch it and throw it im not so sure that if he had tried to throw a fade into the back of the end zone that the clock wouldnt have expired instead, what do they do? they throw a bullet, backshoulder play, as <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> backed into the end zone and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, the wry smile well, it is what we thought it might be one of these kind of games two great coaches, gutsy calls wow &gt;&gt; both of these teams, they have their superstars, but they just add these guys they come out of nowhere you dont hear very much about them new englands done this for years, and seattle with pete carroll and their great gm, john schneider, people say, "how can you draft <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> in the third round?" we know how that turned out picks up guys like <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> what a difference it makes &gt;&gt; yeah, and they have specific roles, right? <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, one of those guys, a big receiver "i bet you hed be good down in the red zone lets see if he can make a play" look what happened &gt;&gt; and a bouncing ball will be fielded at the 31yard line and thats develin who takes a knee and that will take us to halftime, with a lot coming up at the half seattles going to get the secondhalf kickoff what a drive there 80 yards, five plays they ran it twice, threw it three times it took 29 seconds for the seahawks another look at the touchdown here &gt;&gt; just a bullet throw, back shoulder knew exactly what he wanted to do with it get it up high to the 65" <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> no chance for <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> &gt;&gt; right, so lets see what happens &gt;&gt; there he was great first half, though &gt;&gt; gostkowskis kickoff goes through the end zone seattle will take over at the 20 and we go to michele &gt;&gt; i just spoke with pete carroll, who said, after the injury to <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person>, they will not make adjustments in that secondary hes happy with the players theyve got he just said, "we got to go beat theout of some other players and do what we came here to do" as for bill belichick, he said, "this game is no mystery its a players game whichever players play best in the second half will be champions, and thats the way it should be" &gt;&gt; thank you, michele great chess match two guys who have only faced each other twice before believe it or not, these two guys faced each other in 1994 belichick, the head coach of <person player="asante cleveland" race="UNK" position="TE">cleveland</person> pete carroll in his one year with the new york jets and off we go in the second half starting with <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> theyve done a good job bottling him up tonight he goes to the 23yard line his 13th carry but only for 48 yards the buzz brady, his numbers 11 career super bowl td passes, including two in the first half <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> took him a long time to get started didnt have a completion until there were about 5 1/2 minutes left in the half threw that td pass at the end <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> didnt make a single catch this year or in his career fourth player to make his first catch ever in the super bowl third super bowl game of the 49 tied at the half <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> in the backfield give it to him <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> off and running his biggest carry of the night his biggest gain out to the 38yard line for a first down carroll happy about that &gt;&gt; you got to be careful youre trying to step up here and come around here, and you just create a <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> if you get the first linebacker blocked, which <person player="jr sweezy" race="UNK" position="DT">jr sweezy</person> does, now you get that big guy in the secondary, and look out the patriots knew that to start this second half, the seahawks are a team that want to come out and pound the football so far thats exactly whats happening &gt;&gt; as they did against green bay now they run playaction wilson going deep and its caught again! <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>! can you believe whats going on? this is a guy working in a foot locker store when the seahawks called him, said, "come on and try out" he had to tell his boss, "let me get out of work early i have to fly up to seattle" &gt;&gt; ill say one thing for <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> he knows how to subtly work it a little nudge in the back right there against kyle arrington, but enough for him just a little got arrington going forward and his size is the difference look at the height that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> puts on that ball perfect we saw him make so many throws like that in practice &gt;&gt; from the 17 now its <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> typical <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> right here moving the pile forward taking it to the 10yard line &gt;&gt; al, this is what i love about seattles offensive line they love <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and at the end of plays, so many times youll see the offensive linemen come down the field and sort of get on his back and start to push him, almost like a rugby scrum of some kind, and just push him right down the field but if that guy gets going, everything starts to work the read option, the bootleg game, all that starts to work for this offense &gt;&gt; <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> out, turbin in <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> in motion fake it to him give it to turbin and hell get wrestled down a yard short of the first down spot the ball at the 8yard line third and 1 &gt;&gt; ill tell you whos having a really nice game so far is <person player="jr sweezy" race="UNK" position="DT">jr sweezy</person> we have seen him right on some big blocks hes had to take on vince wilfork most of the night a very solid run blocker all season long and this former defensive lineman is coming out here a little angry to start this second half &gt;&gt; got a stack at the bottom of the screen, including <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> there you got <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> back in the game its third down and 1 and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> is gonna get stopped and that is <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> he couldnt get by <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">ninkovich</person> there and thats gonna set up fourth down, and here comes the fieldgoal group &gt;&gt; right off the edge nobody blocked him come right down the line here, and thats just a veteran player understanding the situation gonna give the ball to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, and he just beats them to the punch &gt;&gt; that sets up a 27yard fieldgoal attempt for steven <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> 2 for 2 at the meadowlands last year and that gives the seattle seahawks their first lead of the night beautiful tonight roof open good game 1714 belichick working with his defense on the sideline, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> ready to get the ball for the first time in the second half &gt;&gt; think you only have to say one thing "somebody go cover <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>" &gt;&gt; amazing hauschkas kick results in a touchback doesnt get much better bill belichick took over in 2000 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> took over as the starter in 01 most nfl title games, head coach/quarterback duo go back to otto <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">graham</person> and <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> brown vince lombardi, of course, and bart starr four nfl championship games and super bowls i and ii and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and belichick playing in their sixth super bowl all of them have been very close the previous five have been determined by 4 points or fewer right now we have a 3point game early third quarter <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> quickly to the outside and taken down is <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> after a gain of a couple <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> right there second down and 8 &gt;&gt; here we go <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> right over here, who has been sort of the underneath coverage guy, and theyre trying to just isolate those big guys <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> has been the quickness shane vereen has been the quickness and so far everythings going fine, and yet they look at the scoreboard and its 1714, seattle &gt;&gt; thats <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> sets up on the left side providing leverage here <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> can barely get out of the backfield mcdaniel is there to stop him itll be third down and 6 for new england &gt;&gt; yeah, and now comes the situation its big if you can get them back third and 6 and keep them out of those third and 2s and 3s, because now your pass rush has a chance but so far, it has been <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>s ability to get rid of the football before that pass rush can get there that has allowed them to move the ball up and down the field &gt;&gt; three receivers set to the right side and one <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> up on the left side on third and 6 showing blitz here they come <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets knocked down but gets the pass away and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> has the first down so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> gets taken to the grass but gets it away and converts &gt;&gt; its unbelievable <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> could not have gotten to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> any faster than this right around, right in on him and he still doesnt get the pressure that he needs <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> on the outside weve seen it already if theyre going to play man coverage, seattles going to lose those battles <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person>, <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> this guy is just too good unanimous allpro &gt;&gt; another set here with the guy lined up on the end at the right <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> is eligible they run in that direction, with the unbalanced line, and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> picks up a yard <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> coming up to stuff him second down &gt;&gt; al, dont you get the feeling that the patriots have to be a little disappointed? i think they thought they were going to have a better day running the football theyve been bringing that extra offensive lineman/tight end in, in <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person>, and they just havent been able to establish it so its all <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> &gt;&gt; definitely had that one drive stymied on the interception, and then to get beat by a guy named <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, whos not caught a pass? and then to give up the 5play, 29yard or 29second drive at the end of the first half <person player="brandon bolden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon bolden</person> is now the running back havent seen him fake to him and then the pass is incomplete <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> tossing it over the middle, pressure put on by <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">bennett</person> was anybody in the area? &gt;&gt; he was definitely under pressure again <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> here we go right down inside and hes going to get there again &gt;&gt; could this be grounding? look at this here okay, pressure who is he throwing it to? &gt;&gt; well, i thats a good question [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; hello? third down and 9 play clock at :01 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> over the middle and its picked off at the 42yard line by <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>! second interception <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, over the middle theres a flag on the play the flag is up to the 41yard line <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">avril</person> is down <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lane</person> had the early interception, and he got hurt and is out for the game youve got <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">avril</person> down you got a penalty flag downfield and vinovich will let us know in the meantime, bradys already walking off the field &gt;&gt; here we go watch <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> as this comes across, he goes that way and comes back <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> thought that he had cleared <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> when <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> settled down wagner, athletic enough to jump back underneath it for the huge play &gt;&gt; and the penalty is after &gt;&gt; after the interception, during the return, illegal block in the back intercepting team, number 25 10yard penalty from the spot of the foul seattle keeps the ball first down &gt;&gt; after the pick the penalty is on <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> for the illegal block in the back so that moves the ball back to the midfield stripe right on the 50yard line with 8:07 left in the third and theres <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> &gt;&gt; you know what, al? sometimes, even though you dont get the sacks, if you get the hits, it accelerates the process in the quarterbacks mind and i think that they hurried the clock of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> on that throw <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person>, what a difference when he came back in the lineup, right? under 10 points a game &gt;&gt; missed five games turf toe picked in that same draft, just ahead of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> in 2012 now wilson slings one to the left side <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> again this is just amazing 41yard line he played in the cfl for two years was the rookie of the year in the canadian football league back in 2012 &gt;&gt; brandon browner is one of the biggest, baddest corners ive ever seen in my life and <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> that time just threw him off i mean, these are two huge men going at it on the outside i think they make the switch because browner has more size he can jump up and handle those jump balls but now can he handle his quickness? &gt;&gt; second and 1 from the 41 and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> to move the sticks you know, you were talking about <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> darrell bevell, the offensive coordinator nicknamed him "hardball" for <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> of msnbc, who is here at the game today and this <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> the seahawks <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> said, "i cant believe it every time i wikipedia myself, it keeps coming up the other guy" tomorrow he may supplant msnbc s <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> in the numberone spot &gt;&gt; just jump right over he may be there right now i would say hes trending you and i are so hip but i would say hes trending right now &gt;&gt; no question from the 38yard line off the pistol formation wilson has time look how elusive he is theres a flag down, however there it is you saw it at the 31yard line and wilson will slide to a stop at the 21, and well get the call from vinovich &gt;&gt; you cannot get a hand on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> &gt;&gt; holding defense, number 39 5yard penalty from the end of the run automatic first down &gt;&gt; thats brandon browner thats nothing new, because he draws a ton of penalties &gt;&gt; this is hilarious <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> look at this dead to rights, right? cant even get a finger on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> wilson saw it coming the whole time he just very casually looked like he was looking downfield, but saw him out of the corner of his eye then that little move of his, and takes off this guy is something special &gt;&gt; browner, 39 theres the penalty holding on to <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> and shoving him setting up a first down at the 18yard line <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> still going to the 4 hes just a runaway truck tackled by <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">ninkovich</person> &gt;&gt; watch the move in the middle of the hole right in the middle of this run i think thats <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> that came down there he is al, you described him earlier as a splitfooted runner he runs with his feet so far apart, it allows him to make these lateral cuts, and people really good tacklers cant get their arms wrapped around him &gt;&gt; tukuafus the fullback from the 4 give it to <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn</person> to the 3yard line he goes gain of 1 second and goal the hawks last four drives have been touchdown, field goal, touchdown, and in progress right here &gt;&gt; heres where you really for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, you kind of got to just keep it together, right? okay, you made a big mistake to start the first half, you make a big mistake here in the second half but these two teams have played from behind during the entirety of these playoffs no big deal &gt;&gt; second and goal play fake little lob wide open! touchdown, <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person>! after the <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> interception, six plays, 50 yards flag went down there will be a celebration penalty, which will be assessed on the kickoff &gt;&gt; playaction to get the run game going but lets give credit to <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> a veteran player &gt;&gt; after the touchdown, unsportsmanlike conduct offense, number 89 15yard penalty on the kickoff touchdown is good &gt;&gt; veteran receiver knows how to use the umpire in the middle of the field to pick off the man coverage he did it perfectly brilliant play by <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> his first catch played at stanford theres a guy who hit the mother lode how about catching passes from andrew luck in college and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> as a pro? <person player="stephen hauschka" race="white" position="K">hauschka</person> for the extra point cash in touchdown after the turnover &gt;&gt; we saw <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> going, "24, 24" heres what he was saying who is the best cornerback in all of football? well, part of the debate, darrelle revis, 24, just got beat "24 that makes me number one" [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; you know, hes better than half the lounge acts in vegas hes taken interview sessions to performance art what a character and one heck of a player, by the way after the penalty, the kickoff from 15 yards farther back and <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> runs it back out to the 37 pete carroll took over in 2010 head coach facing his successor and former team go back to super bowl iii, one of the most important games in the history of the nfl weeb ewbank beat don shula thats the joe namath game you go back to 2002 jon gruden had left oakland for some draft choices, bill callahan took over, and gruden won a super bowl with the team that tony dungy had left at that point &gt;&gt; and pete carroll one of the most competitive guys in all of football when we asked him about it, he said, "when i got fired, i dont think they realized what they were losing" may prove prophetic here if this score holds &gt;&gt; three years there, then on to sc and five years now there and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throws and that pass is caught <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> flag is down could be a hold at the 48yard line vinovich will make the call right now &gt;&gt; holding offense, number 66 &gt;&gt; coming back &gt;&gt; 10yard penalty repeat first down &gt;&gt; <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">bryan stork</person> thats the center &gt;&gt; right here you cant block this guy <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> is simply taking over the football game <person player="bryan stork" race="UNK" position="C">bryan stork</person>, a rookie in there, voted the rimington award, best center in college football nobodys been able to block <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> all night &gt;&gt; talking to pete carroll the other day, fired by the jets, fired by the patriots sometimes its a little dicey bringing it up, but he said, "my therapist tells me to talk about it" [ both laugh ] first and 20 from the 25yard line <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> going deep down the left sideline and throws that one on the chalk intended for <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> we go to michele &gt;&gt; seattle starting defensive end <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person> took a heavy hit he has gone to the locker room for a concussion evaluation questionable with a head injury he was escorted off the field and to the locker room by the team internist as well as the leagues unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant, so on his way to that concussion protocol, al &gt;&gt; all right, thank you, michele that means obrien schofield, who wears number 93, comes in to take over that spot there he is fifthyear guy out of wisconsin played here with the cardinals a couple of years ago second down and 20 and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> will dump it off underneath <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> looking for room picks up about 6 extra yards after he was initially stopped gets the ball out to the 36yard line it will be third down and 9 for the pats &gt;&gt; well, here we go down the field <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> obviously <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> not even really looking for a pass thats one of those underplays where he knows all along his job is to block &gt;&gt; key third and 9 <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> comes this way and that way and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> will fire and it is <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> who cant make the catch <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> with <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> right there and fourth and 9, and in comes the punting group &gt;&gt; <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> right here and then i think he gets a glance at <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> coming right for his chin strap but thats a miss by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> just had a chance there looked like it hit him pretty good, but maybe a little flinch &gt;&gt; we have <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> already with 11 tackles and an interception and the punt cannot be saved &gt;&gt; strategy pretty clear for the patriots on defense what they wanted to do is play the four big defensive linemen up front, put <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> in the middle of the defense and let him run sideline to sideline and make plays hes made some pretty nice plays inside, tracking down <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> but it was the play right before the half that really made the difference he did not get the proper leverage on <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> wilsons quickness has been a factor all night and that one right there set up that touchdown right before the half big, big, big mistake &gt;&gt; <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> has carried for 88 yards wilson only 3 carries, but for 39 look at the time he has and then caught up at the 45yard line <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">ricardo lockette</person> making the grab thats a gain of 25 yards &gt;&gt; <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">ricardo lockette</person> kind of makes me laugh they go the bootleg play out of here and watch <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> they say he doesnt read defenses? my foot he must have looked at four different receivers on that play until he finally comes all the way across back to the back side <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is getting very comfortable three touchdowns and a field goal, the last four drives &gt;&gt; after no yards, no completions in the first quarter and most of the second period <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> 2 tough yards 2 1/2 minutes remaining in the third &gt;&gt; you watch a player like <person player="chandler jones" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chandler jones</person> have a free shot like he had on that play against <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, and he barely slowed him down you know? and as you get into the second half, defenses and defenders, especially the big guys, get tired and <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, if youre tired hes hard enough when youre fresh youre tired, it gets really difficult &gt;&gt; a lot of speculation as to whether theyll keep him, whether they can afford him theres some speculation that theyre ready to make a big longterm deal with him going forward catch made on the outside thats <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> makes the tackle kearse, the big hero at the end of the game against green bay with the overtime catch his only catch of that game, after hed been targeted six times all four wilson interceptions were on passes intended for him the other one was incomplete &gt;&gt; how about a guy that had the gamewinning touchdown in backtoback championship games? &gt;&gt; amazing &gt;&gt; right? nfc championship games against san francisco on that fourthdown play the year before comes right back with another one &gt;&gt; and how about a quarterback who keeps going to a guy who keeps getting intercepted every time hes targeted? third and 3 wilson surveys and it is bobbled and dropped that time its <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> again <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person>, one of the extra defensive backs, comes in to help break it up itll be fourth down and 3 &gt;&gt; gonna go here and back around just a little rub route, and they got it they had the rookie, <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> and that time <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> just could not hold on to it huge play that is in scoring position, or your punter comes on the field and here comes <person player="jon ryan" race="white" position="P">jon ryan</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> sets up inside his own 10yard line ooh, low snap picks it up and gets it away <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> says stay away from it and it bounds out of bounds at the 11yard line 2414 you know, you look at the path that each of these teams took 22 was new england going into week 5 they lost in kansas city on that monday night the skys falling seattle was 33, then they were 64 had that big meeting that began to turn things around &gt;&gt; yeah and go figure heres a team down 160 against the green bay packers, but their defense hung in there so well all those turnovers in the first half to give them a chance to get to this game and now their defense again delivering and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>, <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person>, putting on a show, as well &gt;&gt; and new england knows what its like to come from behind they were down twice by 14 in the divisional round to the ravens they start this drive with vereen taking the ball up to the 17yard line for a short gain <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> makes the tackle that knee seems to be fine playing with the brace today &gt;&gt; interesting here, al, that now were getting shane vereen in the backfield theyve been trying to pound it in there with <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person>, and here he comes back in the game now, but you wonder now, as a play caller, is <person player="josh kline" race="UNK" position="OG">josh</person> mcdaniels getting a little frustrated? sometimes vereen ive seen him come in at the end of other games and give them a little burst maybe hes thinking it may be time &gt;&gt; hes got <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> they also put the fullback in there, develin and brady, off playaction, throws caught it will be a gain close to a first down develin makes the catch he scored a touchdown in the afc championship game thats gonna take us to the fourth quarter seahawks owner <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> allen, gm john schneider <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> bought the team in 97 started microsoft with bill gates left there in 83 made a ton of money, but hes been a phenomenal philanthropist microsoft all over the place here right now hes given away hundreds of millions, i think even billions of dollars to fight diseases, medical research facilities, and all of the rest but kind of an undertheradar guy whos now watched his team get to three super bowls in the last 10 years third and 1 al michaels, cris collinsworth, michele tafoya 15 minutes to go in regulation third and 1 from the 23yard line in a 10point game <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> got him by the shirttail cant get away tony mcdaniel was able to bring him back and they have to punt on a fourth down &gt;&gt; we dont talk about them much, but tony mcdaniel, kevin williams, right up the middle, the big guys when you have to have a stop in a thirdand1 situation, you have to get in the backfield to be able to slow down a <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> they got the job done there &gt;&gt; whatever happened to the tearaway jerseys? &gt;&gt; [ chuckles ] &gt;&gt; low linedrive kick coming up to field it is walters at the 31 and he gets tackled at the 35yard line &gt;&gt; here we go a little hardball with <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> down the field this is the one this offense was stuck in the mud until <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> made that play right before the half, 6 seconds to go, who do you throw it to? of course, the guy that doesnt have a catch all year and then down the field against arrington oh, maybe a little pushoff gets away with it he has been the difference in the game finally jumpstarting that passing game &gt;&gt; <person player="rod smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rod smith</person> of the broncos, most yards by an undrafted free agent <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> played those two years in canada was the rookie of the year in the cfl was working in a sportinggoods store, selling shoes, when seattle called and said, "get up here for a tryout" &gt;&gt; you cant make this up &gt;&gt; youre right you cannot make this up from the 36yard line thats what we love about sports gain of 3 for <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> &gt;&gt; now i think youre starting to see some run blitzes here out of the new england patriots here comes <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> this is not expecting a pass that is so they can clog up the middle against <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and create some opportunities for the other linebacker there, <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">donta hightower</person>, to come over and help make the tackle &gt;&gt; second and 8 little over a minute into the fourth quarter <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> oh, he gets popped <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">branch</person> is right there, former seahawk, to make sure he goes nowhere third down &gt;&gt; big old vince wilfork you run in there at your own risk just gonna make a play look at trying to block that guy <person player="jr sweezy" race="UNK" position="DT">jr sweezy</person>s had a nice game, but anytime you see vince wilfork contact, arms fully extended that means hes totally under control in there then just stymied <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> &gt;&gt; wilfork and brady, the two remaining guys from their last super bowl championship team in 2004 third and 7 wilson with a ton of time and then all of a sudden here through the middle comes <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">rob ninkovich</person> found the crease, gets in there big sack happy birthday to <person player="rob ninkovich" race="UNK" position="DE">ninkovich</person> hes 31 today &gt;&gt; coverage sack here darrelle revis on the inside on <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> maybe a chance there, but that pressure really took a long time to materialize you just wonder if <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> was probably looking on the outside there then ninkovich, the old veteran eight sacks on the year for the third straight year, and now the patriots have got to get something going on the offensive side &gt;&gt; three sacks for the pats ryans kick collected at the 18 <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> good runback out to the 33yard line the two tds, tying him with montana all time with 11 two interceptions and were getting a little bit closer to serious crunch time &gt;&gt; no doubt about it and for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, it has been a week of distractions hes had good moments in this game hes made some big mistakes im sure its been tough to focus this week &gt;&gt; two full weeks he starts from the 32 and hes going to get sacked everybody covered and <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> comes in to knock him down &gt;&gt; coverage all over the field <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person>, who gave up the first pass of the game, and that has been it gronkowski, when he ended up in oneonone coverage against <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person>, had a play but just nowhere to throw the football &gt;&gt; 8yard sack thats seattles first sack of the game patriots have three second and 18 slings it to the outside to <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> not a lot of room <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> there for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>, you know, i think it started out chronologically he couldnt believe what the deal was the day after the indianapolis game then he played a lot of defense the first week then they get here, he did that interview with bob on tuesday &gt;&gt; which looked a little uncertain &gt;&gt; he was all over the place but then he told you as you look at roger goodell he told you on wednesday to your face &gt;&gt; i said, "tom, look me in the eye and tell me you couldnt have possibly said anything to a ball boy, an assistant coach, somebody in the organization that would lead them to believe that you wanted air let out of that football" and he said, "absolutely not" he could not have been more emphatic &gt;&gt; third and 14 and bradys going to step up, fire over the middle &gt;&gt; oh! &gt;&gt; and it is taken by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> was not down, even though hit by <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> theyre going to say that his knee touched, but the officials are going to spot the ball inside the 40yard line &gt;&gt; what a great play here by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> hit him hard and then the forearm looks to be down, so i think theyre gonna bring that one back &gt;&gt; i think the knee was down, too &gt;&gt; forearm, elbow, knee were gonna get it all &gt;&gt; name it &gt;&gt; right there &gt;&gt; and now one official comes in and says, "no, no, hes down" so theyll spot it at the 49, but thats still a first down a gain of 21 on a third and 14 so, very big play for the patriots, obviously clock ticking down to the 10minute <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> first down at the 49 &gt;&gt; tell you, you run a route across the middle against this defense, you do so against your own risk with <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> in there &gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has to dump it to vereen he swings to the outside skirts the sideline close to a first down before hes thrust out late hit, flag on the play &gt;&gt; personal foul unnecessary roughness defense, number 29 late hit out of bounds 15yard penalty on the end of the run automatic first down &gt;&gt; <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> &gt;&gt; heady play by <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> here watch him set outside to invite <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">avril</person> inside, which really sets the space for the screen play on the outside to shane vereen &gt;&gt; and theres thomas knocking him down he had help, as well earl, number 29 call went on him pats have it at the 27 fake to vereen <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> going for 6 knocked away <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">brandon lafell</person> the intended receiver, and <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person>, who came in for the injured <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> early and a guy they were picking on, with the defense &gt;&gt; fantastic play by <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person> under so much pressure in this game, having to come in, having to deliver gets his right hand on the ball just enough to feel the receiver on the outside great, great play sometimes, al, in these big games, its the guys you least expect, right? youve been playing that game all week whos going to be the surprise mvp? &gt;&gt; oh, <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person> we all knew that, didnt we? &gt;&gt; [ laughs ] &gt;&gt; second and 10 vereen cuts it back, takes it to the 25 we go to michele &gt;&gt; you mentioned how <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> is out of this game and now defensive end <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person> is out with a concussion and remember, under the concussion protocol, the madden rule prevents anyone diagnosed with a concussion from coming back out of the locker room and even if they win this game, al, <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff avril</person> will not be able to talk to the media &gt;&gt; mm thank you, michele there he is you saw the play on which he was hurt ball at the 25 clearly theyre already in fieldgoal range they spread it out here so, at worst, they should, even with an incompletion, be able to make it a onepossession game <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> looking for more stepping up third and 8 throws first down and more <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> takes the ball to the 3yard line to set up a first down and goal and edelman, bothered by a hip early in the game against indianapolis, a little slow in getting up &gt;&gt; i think this is <person player="demarcus dobbs" race="UNK" position="DT">demarcus dobbs</person>, drops back in coverage, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> brilliantly just waits for him to get on the other side of the defensive lineman edelman, nice read gets right across the back side there of <person player="demarcus dobbs" race="UNK" position="DT">dobbs</person> huge play &gt;&gt; ball just inside the 5yard line 8:20 remaining in regulation <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> has now caught 24 passes in the three postseason games vereen is the back the fake to him <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> fires and incomplete <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> was backing up <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">simon</person> covering on the play incomplete, second down &gt;&gt; oh, my goodness what a move by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> here watch this one in, stop on a dime, back out could not be more wide open, and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> missed the throw thats as open as you will ever get down on the goal line no reason to hurry that one that was game, set, and match that was total victory for a wide receiver on the goal line &gt;&gt; <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> is back in the fake to him <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> dances, throws and it will be caught <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> for the touchdown! so new england goes from a second and 18 after the first play on this drive to go 68 yards in nine plays and an extra point away from making it a 3point game &gt;&gt; <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> as poor as the last throw was from brady, this one is that good he just has to work on the other side of <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> he sees it throw it to the right shoulder no way thomas can get there whew! this game is turning into something here &gt;&gt; we thought it would but you never know &gt;&gt; so did the oddsmakers, right? &gt;&gt; tossup, just about five catches for <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> for 48 yards <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> for the extra point &gt;&gt; we could be playing football all night tonight even in overtime, they play until somebody wins &gt;&gt; tom, with his three tds tonight has now passed montana all alone as the guy throwing the most in the history of this game a dozen gostkowskis kick will not be run back glendale, arizona fourthquarter defense for these two teams seattles last eight games, counting the two postseason games, theyve allowed one touchdown, 13 points, then went the last six regularseason games without allowing a point in the fourth quarter and then the patriots, very similar, have not allowed a touchdown in their last eight games, counting the two postseason games just four field goals now, tonight, new england has scored here in the fourth, and well see what seattle can muster up as they start this drive from the 20yard line wilson off playaction surveying ton of time and then the receiver falls down <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">lockette</person> looks around he says, "wheres the flag? i got knocked down" there is no flag second down &gt;&gt; well, it looked like butler trips here i dont know if they trip over each others feet and then he reaches out and basically trips the receiver that should have been some sort of interference that was definitely an intentional act got away with it &gt;&gt; he did second down and 10 trips left three receivers there <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> fighting hes always fighting to the 25yard line gain of 5 third and 5 &gt;&gt; what makes <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> great? one, his escapability even when you think you completely have him under control, you dont have him under control youve got him dead in your sights, you cant get a hand on him and then the deep balls high, arcing throws, giving his receivers a chance those two components have been the difference here for the seattle seahawks so far and as you get to this point in the game, <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> running the ball always becomes a big threat &gt;&gt; on third and 5 wilson sliding right and then throws that one out of bounds <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> going down the sideline, and incomplete so its a very fast threeandout exactly what new england was looking for &gt;&gt; <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> is going to do a little out and then up really, he was wide open <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> came underneath that little pick, but it looked like <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> just sort of hesitated and stopped didnt really believe he was going to throw it to him, i guess &gt;&gt; <person player="jon ryan" race="white" position="P">jon ryan</person>, who has averaged 46 yards a punt you see <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> backing up as the short man points back to <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> hell call for a fair catch and haul it in at the 36 robert kraft bought the team in the mid90s, turned a mediocre franchise into a juggernaut his teams have gone to seven super bowls, including one with bill parcells hes only hired two coaches theres one of them the other is on the other sideline he inherited parcells there is belichick with his defense of course, its going to be a wild last seven minutes for the kraft family and all patriot fans and who knows what the next few weeks will hold? first things first from the 36yard line <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> starts out of the gun vereen flanks him fourman rush <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> dumps onehanded grab by vereen gain of 8 yards <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wright</person> and <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> are there itll be second down and 2 &gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> really wanted to go to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> basically, they can pick a side because these corners dont flip he looked out there and thought better of throwing it over to <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person>s side and then got a brilliant catch from vereen it is shane vereen time in this game and, really, thats when they were having success early when they were working that edelmanvereen combination over the middle &gt;&gt; second and 2 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to the outside thats enough for a first down theres vereen <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> makes the tackle that moves the sticks first down to the 48 &gt;&gt; that time <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> knew it was man coverage ran up the field just made <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> shuffle a little bit and athletically, you like vereen on <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> if you get that matchup so well see if they come back to that &gt;&gt; as we go down the stretch, each team with its full complement of timeouts &gt;&gt; <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> oneonone on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> &gt;&gt; <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> out of the slot send it to him breaks a tackle then another takes the ball close to a first down <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person>, quarterback at kent state what a player what a find this guy was seventhround draft choice in 2009 &gt;&gt; hes strong, and hes athletic but the thing that i appreciate more than anything about him guy shows up at the complex at 5:00 am every day studies, catches extra balls on the jugs machine hes made himself a great player in this league &gt;&gt; under five minutes swing it out vereen first down flag comes down vereen lost the ball, but he was down already and well see about the call bill vinovich, reffing his first super bowl game only eight accepted penalties in the game &gt;&gt; pass interference offense, number 11 blocking downfield prior to the catch 10yard penalty repeat second down &gt;&gt; so the call is on <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> it backs might be on <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> he said 11, but is that amendola? &gt;&gt; but heres what happened, al because of the pressure, <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> had to lob that pass up over the top so this is one of those designed plays where youre gonna go down the field and intentionally block, thinking that this pass is going to come out quickly but because he had to lob it up, the blocking got there too soon, so its pass interference &gt;&gt; yeah, he just changed it they did call it on <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> almost got a hand on it so instead of second and 1, its second and 11 we got <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> on <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> they havent gone shermans way staying away from him much as <person player="aaron dobson" race="UNK" position="WR">aaron</person> rodgers did on opening night <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> hit as he throws caught by gronkowski! and the big bull takes it to the 32yard line &gt;&gt; theyre rolling the dice here theyre putting their big safety, <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person>, on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> earlier they got burned with <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj wright</person> you want to go man coverage and i think a little bit, because shane vereens been effective coming out of the backfield, theyve had to change up their secondary coverage a little bit and right now <person player="josh kline" race="UNK" position="OG">josh</person> mcdaniels got it going with this play calling &gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> hung in under pressure ball at the 32 already within gostkowskis fieldgoal range <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> will swing it out vereen and theres <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person>, whose girlfriend is pregnant shes due in about two weeks, but shes here hes ready to go to the hospital in uniform if need be &gt;&gt; well, and richard was telling us that she said, "you go play the super bowl dont worry about me ive got all that set up if something gets accelerated here" &gt;&gt; look at that thrown at one time once richard says, "its everything i can do to keep from getting bored" &gt;&gt; i guarantee hes not bored right now &gt;&gt; mnhmnh second and 10 little more than 4 to go <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> fires caught first down and again they go to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> out at the 20yard line &gt;&gt; al, here it is again theyre just telling <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> this is man coverage hes off hes inside hes looking right at <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> everybody in the building that knows anything about football knows thats man coverage and 1,000% of the time now, they are gonna throw it right there when they get that look &gt;&gt; half a dozen catches for him now through the middle big hole for vereen, and he takes the ball to the 12yard line <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> is there you know, 3:20, you begin to think about using the clock theyre already in fieldgoal range, but seattle still has all of its timeouts you still have the 2minute warning youre still going to have four opportunities to stop the clock &gt;&gt; this is about scoring a touchdown right here &gt;&gt; correct any way you can at any time you can &gt;&gt; no clock management &gt;&gt; not yet not yet three minutes to go second and 3 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to the outside caught and thats <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> before he steps out of bounds he is out of bounds at the 6yard line, and that makes it first and goal with 2:52 on the clock &gt;&gt; they finally come out of that man coverage and go a zone but theyre really lucky that <person player="brandon lafell" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lafell</person> on that one couldnt get himself under control because i think he would have scored &gt;&gt; 71 is reporting as eligible 71 is an eligible receiver &gt;&gt; you hear the announcement fleming comes in, the tackle, as an eligible receiver 71 <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> playing the middle <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> looking at the clock <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> says, "ill take a timeout" play clock was all the way down to :02 <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> will go to the sideline &gt;&gt; first charged timeout &gt;&gt; <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> tonight has put it up 49 times the 36 completions is a super bowl record crazy two weeks great game who knows what the immediate future will hold? &gt;&gt; you know, i think everybody we know the ramifications of what ted wells investigation is going to be somebody is going to come out of this with egg on their face either the patriots, the league office, the people that have accused the patriots all that stuffs in play but isnt it glorious just for these three or four hours here, that you can just enjoy a football game? &gt;&gt; well, as the old coach john madden always said, "you know, a game breaks out" and it broke out tonight &gt;&gt; but there are it is going to be big in the following month &gt;&gt; again, fleming an eligible receiver, number 71 first and goal the ball at the 6 develin, the fullback <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> is the running back <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> powering his way to the 3yard line stopped there gain of 3 second down and goal &gt;&gt; theyre gonna try and load up and go with the big power runner, even though its basically been vereen and the matchup problems that he has created thats gotten them down the field here &gt;&gt; under 2:30 <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> out vereen in second and goal <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> caught touchdown! <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person>! &gt;&gt; came back to it, al they came right back to it down, back out worked brilliantly before <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> missed the pass come right back to it, and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> gets it done no pushoff no foul no nothing and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> takes them right down the field &gt;&gt; and there again, they go to work on <person player="tharold simon" race="UNK" position="DB">tharold simon</person>, who took the place of the injured <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> they picked on him early he got his feet under him played well for about a quarter and a half they go back that way again and burn him <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> for the extra point and that makes it a 4point lead, meaning seattles gonna need a touchdown last two new england drives 9 plays for 68, 10 plays for 64 and the kraft family robert and jonathan theyve seen a few exciting games again, youve got a close game every super bowl that new englands played in since belichick and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> took over has been decided by 4 or less <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>s been here before heck, he was down 160 two weeks ago &gt;&gt; i cant help but think of what <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> told us he said, the minute i pulled that trophy down i held it up in the air and i pulled it down, and i started thinking about the next one i started thinking about the next super bowl opportunity" he said he wanted six he grew up remembering michael jordan holding up six fingers he said, "im looking for six" this second one is going to be on his shoulders with two minutes to go &gt;&gt; so 2:02 if the kickoff is a touchback, theyre going to get a play before the 2minute warning otherwise, the clocks going to stop they have all of their timeouts and <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">gostkowski</person> will send that one deep into the night so they will get one play off before the 2minute warning that will stop the clock, and theyll preserve their three timeouts patriots overcoming a 10point deficit again, we go back to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> telling us yesterday, "there would not be a game i would want to win more than this one" <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> gets flanked out empty backfield wilson down the sideline <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> makes the catch! and hell get tackled by <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> but thats a big gain, taking us to the 2minute warning they still have their three timeouts &gt;&gt; what a call that was by darrell bevell <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> saw <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> oneonone against the linebacker, <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> slant and go to a running back that is confidence in the ability of not just <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person>, but <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> and a trust with the season on the line brilliant call brilliant throw and now theyre at midfield could this game be any better? &gt;&gt; mmmmmmm plenty left, too 1:55 that was lynchs first catch of the game they blitz wilson fires and thats incomplete intended for <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> looks around for a flag gets none <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person>, the rookie out of west alabama, a free agent, with the defense &gt;&gt; can you imagine what this rookie is thinking? and he could not have played this better perfect position going to come, jump inside, knock it away brilliant play &gt;&gt; mmmmm from the 49 second and 10 play clock at :01 and now wilson has to take a timeout so they have three, so he takes one here play clock was all the way down &gt;&gt; first charged timeout, seattle 30second timeout &gt;&gt; you know whats interesting? <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">chris matthews</person>, whos had the unbelievable game, because teams work on packages of plays, and so when you get in the 2minute offense, theyve practiced with the guys that they have in there <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> and <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">lockette</person> and <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> and so he hasnt been a part of this and yet if youve watched the game, you know hes the one that sort of broke it open &gt;&gt; sure now hes coming in hell be a part of this next play here on second down and 10 <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> has caught 4 for 109 yards and a touchdown second and 10 two timeouts now left for the seahawks key guys on the field willson, the tight end, has not caught a pass in this game deep drop ton of time going for it all knocked away browner is back there there was <person player="chris matthews" race="UNK" position="WR">matthews</person> and brandon browner, who was a seahawk last year but was suspended at the end of the season and had to watch the super bowl has a ring and then left for new england in free agency &gt;&gt; gonna go right up the seam here the patriots came with a threeman rush and they made this switch early and i think, for matt patricia, its been a good one the jump balls, now that you have a 64" cornerback, are a little more fair, little more favorable for the patriots &gt;&gt; third and 10 flank <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">lynch</person> again wilson hangs in there throws thats caught thats going to be a first down 38yard line <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">ricardo lockette</person> and now theyll hustle up to the line of scrimmage, preserving the timeouts under 1:30 to go &gt;&gt; weve seen when <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> has been in the game the play right before the half and now theyre coming back to him <person player="ricardo lockette" race="UNK" position="WR">lockette</person> is a guy with brilliant speed, so ryan has to be careful &gt;&gt; russell in the pocket russell for kearse, and its broken up again and is it but somehow &gt;&gt; holy cow &gt;&gt; did he wind up with the football? &gt;&gt; i think butler hit it and it fell right back down to the ground unbelievable! thats exactly what happened, isnt it? &gt;&gt; well, <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> goes for it its still not on the ground its still whoa, look at that phenomenal &gt;&gt; i cant believe he didnt get up and get in the end zone in time &gt;&gt; and then butler takes him out so he breaks up the play, but at the end of the day look at that does a juggling act has it at the 5 first and goal 33 yards and now, by the time they get down there, the play clock has run out again &gt;&gt; second charged timeout &gt;&gt; and seattle takes a timeout crazy! &gt;&gt; how many different plays are the patriots going to have like this? mario manningham, david tyree and now <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> &gt;&gt; this was where tyree had the helmet catch this was the scene of the crime for new england &gt;&gt; and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> had that look on his face like, "you got to be kidding me not again" &gt;&gt; here you go back to super bowl xlii tyree makes the catch our buddy rodney harrison had a birdseye view plaxico burress winds up with the touchdown to win the game and end what would have been a perfect season for the patriots they were 180 coming in &gt;&gt; you know, al, you play 16 games, couple of playoff games, and it comes down to one tipped ball that falls on the ground to somebody whos lying on his back [ both laugh ] &gt;&gt; <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> has seen it all, but not that look at that &gt;&gt; but theyre not in yet &gt;&gt; and theres <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">duron harmon</person>, who comes over the top he had a chance to maybe kick it away <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kearse</person> comes up with it amazing the ball at the 5 &gt;&gt; now you have to stop <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> &gt;&gt; here he goes beast mode to the halfyard line and now new england has to think about taking a timeout &gt;&gt; boy, the last time we called a super bowl, al, remember? &gt;&gt; ahmad bradshaw &gt;&gt; do you let them score? do you put the ball back in the hands of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person>? and i guarantee you bill belichick is sitting here thinking about it right now &gt;&gt; its on his mind it has to be do you bleed the clock all the way down? theyre bleeding it right down to half a minute second and goal <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> sets up on the left play clock at :05 pass is intercepted at the goal line by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person>! unreal! <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person>, who almost made the phenomenal play that wound up in kearses arms there are flags on the field for celebration amazing! butler, a rookie free agent out of west alabama &gt;&gt; they tried a pick play, al they tried to go here, but he beats him to the punch and im sorry, but i cant believe the call &gt;&gt; me neither &gt;&gt; i cannot believe the call youve got <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> in the backfield youve got a guy thats been borderline unstoppable in this part of the field i cant believe the call &gt;&gt; and theres <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> as demonstrative as ever and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> going, "what?" i agree with you why make that call? youre down on the halfyard line &gt;&gt; we have unsportsmanlike conduct against the new england bench after the interception the penalty will be half the distance to the goal new england keeps the ball first down &gt;&gt; well, its half the distance to the goal, which is next to nothing and now seattle had to use two timeouts, so they can only stop the clock once and barring complete insanity and i mean complete &gt;&gt; i dont believe it &gt;&gt; its going to be a win for the patriots &gt;&gt; i im sitting here, and i absolutely cannot believe that play call if i lose the super bowl because <person player="marshawn lynch" race="nonwhite" position="RB">marshawn lynch</person> cant get it in from the 1yard line, so be it so be it but there is no way iii dont believe the call you know, you think youve got it, you think you understand other team practices, too [ sighs ] &gt;&gt; so, now, barring a fumbled snap well, lets see bradys got to be able to get the ball out of the end zone otherwise, it would be 2 points and theyd have to have a free kick from the 20 thats seattles first turnover of the game &gt;&gt; second charged timeout, new england &gt;&gt; figure out a way well, bradys so good at the sneak just take it and start plowing forward just make sure you dont wind up with the ball in the end zone &gt;&gt; so you got the pick play, all right? you know, you think youre gonna have it, you think but why? i you know, how about <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person>? gives up the fluke play down the field looks like hes going to be partly responsible and makes an incredible play you got to get it out of here, though and belichick will say, "make sure these guys fire off" look at everybody inside oh, my goodness &gt;&gt; of all things, if they jumped off and werent drawn, that will take them to the 6yard line the officials will confer &gt;&gt; <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> jumps offsides more than anybody else 10 times this year and in this critical, lastchance moment, he does again &gt;&gt; unless he was drawn &gt;&gt; encroachment &gt;&gt; and he wasnt &gt;&gt; defense, number 72 5yard penalty still first down &gt;&gt; give <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> credit he just drew him they were going total scrum in behind and bill belichick knows, after all the heartbreak we saw it, al tyree, mario manningham, fluky plays this time, after all the stuff of these two weeks &gt;&gt; and then a scrum, of course here you go flags so youll have an ugly ending to what was a pretty terrific ball game well, a lot of frustration out there for the guys in blue &gt;&gt; you know, from seattles standpoint whatever from new englands standpoint, youre 18 seconds away from a super bowl championship you dont throw a punch at anybody here <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> takes a shot from bennett, who im sure is frustrated then <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> throws one back, and here we go [ laughs ] every once in a while in the nfl, you think youve seen it all &gt;&gt; no, you havent &gt;&gt; i will never get over throwing the ball in that situation &gt;&gt; third and final timeout, seattle &gt;&gt; neither will seahawk fans &gt;&gt; after the play, personal foul, unnecessary roughness instigator, number 51, has been ejected 15yard penalty automatic first down &gt;&gt; that is <person player="bruce irvin" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bruce irvin</person> meanwhile, think about butler this kid is a free agent played at a smaller school hes from vicksburg, mississippi played at west alabama pats signed him last may transferred from hinds, mississippi, community college super bowl hero &gt;&gt; and, al, you could tell he had done his homework he saw the pick play coming the minute his receiver came inside, he fired if there was anything else on, he wasnt gonna get there he was gonna give up the gamewinning touchdown but he did his homework and he fired his shot and made the play of the year &gt;&gt; so the patriots on the cusp of making it four in the 21st century belichicks already taken the shower his team down by 10 in the fourth quarter bob kraft and jonathan kraft are already down there and one kneeldown should end the game what a journey the sky was falling in early october theres a lot of bright sunshine right now in foxborough and all over new england and after the wackiest leadup to a super bowl ever, the new england patriots are the nfl champions &gt;&gt; great game &gt;&gt; give them room, guys give them room
