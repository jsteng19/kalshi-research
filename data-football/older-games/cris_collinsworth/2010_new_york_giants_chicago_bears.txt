teams have been a very big problem for the giants among other problems certainly their return teams their coverage teams on the other side of the coin the bears have been terrific on special teams daniel manning will run back ticks and if you saw the game on monday night you know that <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> was such a key part of that in returning punts one for a touchdown and the other to set up a touchdown so on a cool night temperature is now 59 degrees on this third night of october a pass the 35 and he steps out of bounds at around the 40yard line a good field position for the chicago bears as we meet the offense <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> vanderbilt university <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> tulane university brandon mano male una arizona <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person>

touchdowns receptions over the first three games to the air we have a flag for a false start false start number 68 offense fiveyard penalty first down karl jeffries that s <person player="frank omiyale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">frank</person> oh meow who is playing left tackle he normally plays on the other side but <person player="chris williams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">chris williams</person> is down tonight again so oh meow gets the start he gets the penalty and this offensive line for lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> has really been shuffled they struggled early on when <person player="chris williams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">chris williams</person> went down but seemed to settle down last week first and 15 they wonder the <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear</person> is trying to get their one again on track <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> to the 37 no bigger deal last year than when <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> came over to chicago in the town went wild it wasnt a good start for me through four interceptions on opening night as some denied her at green bay then the team got hot but then they wound up with a <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark</person> of seven and nine he didnt have a good year he s the first to admit it he has a new offensive coordinator well talk a lot about mike march tonight and feels a whole lot better about 2010 <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> lives up now in the backfield on the and he takes the swing pass and that s a great one arm tackle by <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey webster</person> 123 not letting the other out of his grasp third down the bears come out with three receivers to the right side and then are going to just try and flip the ball out to <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> and make him a punt returner here just get the ball in space and you expect him to be able to make the first guy miss before <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> that s terrific ten of the game this time a pleasure quartey is the back he stays in the block <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> under pressure and cut like it s taken down in the 34 yard line by oc newman yura so the giants despite those penalties despite missing <person player="mathias kiwanuka" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kiwanuka</person> a very good defensive first series and <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> on the outside of your screen there is going to get the early pressure working against <person player="kevin shaffer" race="white" position="OG">kevin shaffer</person> <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> has to step up and through and there s those of you man yura who has been the leading sacker on this giants team five of the last six years the only time he wasnt was the uri was hurt the king <person player="darius reynaud" race="nonwhite" position="WR">darius</person> romano chemo at the beginning of the year for minnesota let s it bow at the 22 juglans the balm is lucky to recover it back of the 16 who s been struggling and he almost lost his job right there dying it s offense coming out onto the field let s take a look <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> old myths lamar <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> marshall medicine head stock north carolina <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> southern cal i came knicks north carolina <person player="kevin boss" race="white"

mackenzie losing his cool last week a couple of personal fouls against tennessee and the word is right the pass is on intended christine <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> he was on a roll <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> was covering on the play and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> almost got to manning before we released it well one thing you know when you play against the chicago bears theyre gonna play so hard down hill with their linebackers that theyre gonna just all the time when you show run theyre going to attack so you have to go playaction you have to go bootleg and hear <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> was wide open down the field and <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> able to recover because the ball wasnt throwing that way there s been instantly second and 10 quick clips to snitch but he gets taken down immediately by <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> at the 23 yard line and let s take a look at pett <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> who was probably the most coveted free agent acquisition of the offseason and <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> is allowed to go to either side that he wants it is at his discretion he will start the game by going left and right and then sometime in the second half just picked the guy that he thinks he has the easiest path against and sort of stay on that side third and three a little toss took <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> and he moved in behind <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> who had set up on the right side making that the strong side but not enough to pick up the first down so the giants come up a yard shy and theyll punt and that means <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> the last time hester was in new york across the parking lot at the old stadium back in oh six on a sunday night at the end of the half there was a missed field goal he took it eight yards into the endzone and ran it back for 108 yard touchdown <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">matt dodge</person>d the giant rookie drops it and <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> who s at all kind flags all over the place in the giant and if anybody have a sleepless night last night it s the rookie <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> who s had to really rough games on a decent night in indianapolis here s jeffries ineligible downfield on the kicking team number 54 turn time out and the worst thing was out he could have walked for the first down he checked it when he just had to run five yards to get the first down well he was thinking about what s getting out of <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> at that point manhattan that lower manhattan and the shot right there is the beers with their second series and that s a quick flip and theyre doing a lot of that lately the <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">earl bennett</person> for a gain of seven here s the giant defense <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> third im very cold field northwestern <person player="chris canty" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chris canty</person> wahhoowah oc human your university of troy glen centum virginia <person player="jonathan goff" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> go vanderbilt university michael bowie southern miss <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">corey webster</person> lsu answer a role that you kenneth <person player="kenny phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DB">phillips</person> he you draw thomas usc aka the university of virginia they swing it to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> and the is a good pass cut fruit fits in very nicely and what mike martz wants to do with his offense picks up the first down the tackle is made by <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> pretty interesting watch <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> go out and through to lead this play this is almost like a one man running screen here flip it over the top and pick up the first down when fruits the old guy getting it done up front this is such a young offensive line and reshuffled inexperienced offensive line <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> makes all the line calls up front and is absolutely critical to their success routes in his third key here six poles for the another under pressure again and down he goes again and that time it s kathy from wah wah wah and also <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> i thought the biggest difference in watching the giants play a week ago was <person player="chris canty" race="nonwhite" position="DE">chris canty</person> playing inside here he is just an absolute load against the run game and the pass game that theyre gonna try and block him oneonone with <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">roberto garza</person> theyre gonna have a problem and not to mention their best defensive player <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> coming from the other side second sack of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> already tonight s the giants knowing that they had to pick it up upfront have done just an early in the game on second and 19 to the 49yard line to bennet that s something <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> does so well he can throw almost like brett farve like throw offbalance throw moving backwards takes the deep drop rolls a lot throws from outside of the pocket can do anything and he says mike martz has been trying to coach him up but he said ive been doing it my whole life and for some reason im almost more comfortable throwing from strange position so this sort of strange marriage between mike martz and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> theyre puffy gonna have a few interesting and on third and ten timeout is taken here by the chicago bears now the giants we mentioned at the top at loss going back to last year ten of their last 14 and during that period of time theyve given up 31 and a half points a game the most in the national football league and that s about 10 points a game more than on average mean the average game in the league over the past couple of years the average team scores 21 points and the giants have given up 31 and a half but you know we talked about mike martz and the expectations are that okay it s going to take a little while to get this bears offense together well the same thing goes for perry fuel and this giants defense and watching the tapes of every one of their games you could really see the growth from week one to week three and tonight looks even better third down and ten the passage looked away at the <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> had gotten beaten by hester hester was behind them the quarry got a hand up and knocks it down fourth down that was just a little bit under thrown there because <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> had a step on cory <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> nice release off the line of scrimmage put his hand up and if that ball is thrown out in front of them theyre gonna get a touchdown from <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> just a board throw that time by <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> second punt last time were not must the pump i was able to get it back he sets up at the 10yard line jaya that bounces inside the five but scoots into the end zone for a touchback try to get into the corner yes miss giant savage 220 when we come back so tomorrow morning on the usa network dont miss the showdown between the united states and europe final round coverage

player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> you also see <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> jumping to the outside which is really what created that cutback opportunity good job by bayer <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">pascoe</person> seeing that stun and turning out on <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> at the 31 yard line on first down <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> the giants <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> sharing the duty but <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> is the number one guy let s see the <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear</person> defense right here <person player="israel idonije" race="nonwhite" position="DT">israel idonije</person> man it s over mats we know 14 <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> past eight <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> north carolina he said tino he saw more hawaii <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> university of new mexico <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> desert swarm arizona <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> georgia <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> louisiana monroe danielle man abilene christian trials <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> the university of louisiana they give it to <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> again inside handoff in the first chasing on the fun im at abound and <person player="chris snee" race="white" position="OG">snee</person> again with a good block up front and then <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> downfield good hard running in a 20 yard gain for <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> but a flag and the giants already walking it back is it on <person player="mario manningham" race="nonwhite" position="WR">manningham</person> on the outside there s no foul for holding on the play go a flag and pick it up to the delight of this crowd at the new meadowlands stadium any time you see a run down the field you know youre two wide receivers out here going to get blocks and <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> that eighth guy in the box down there this time it was <person player="dj moore" race="UNK" position="DB">dj moore</person> he just just enough of them to allow <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> to go by and one thing and im all for promoting the cause here these pink gloves do stick out a little bit so i do wouldnt be surprised to see a few extra holding calls today and you saw <person player="mario manningham" race="nonwhite" position="WR">manningham</person> with a little bit of a hold then he put his hands up to say im innocent the pass is complete knicks were about nine and a half yards close to a first down for our key knicks the 61 215 pound receiver and the real key the giants have established a bit of a running game here so far and if you can do that against the bears all of a sudden the playaction that really hasnt been there so far for the new york giants starts to look good as those linebackers attack the line of scrimmage jeffries wants to bring in the chain gang it s that close yellow line not official but were gonna go out on a limb and say it s not a first down <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> is not just saying hi to people he s checking out either his wrist or his hand or his elbow or something sore and they wanted to see his strength before they set him back out so much for the yellow line that s what we told you it s not official speaking of the <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear</person> defense as chris just was lowest in the national football league giving up only thirty nine point seven yards a game and look at that average per rush two point one rod marinelli came over last year coach the defensive line a couple of years ago he was the head coach at tampa go all the way back pell accommodations willie tony dungy stares jacob s up first down taking the ball to the 35yard line so for <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> a couple of years ago he s the bull he s the stud he s the guy who s gonna just blow you out and blow you over and then last year he tailed off and then this year he starts the season as the number two guy and an opening day at <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> carrying 20 times and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> carrying 12 we saw tom coplin the next week and he says that s about the ratio id like to see well and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> has hurt himself with some past protection he s missed a couple of blitz pickups the last few weeks and given up some sacks second and seven the patch is deflected and another interception on a deflection manning this year was six picks five of them have been tipped or deflected and almost another one right there third down tip passes have been awful for the giants this year and <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> is sort of the master of this dont think that was an accident that he tipped that ball up the chicago bears probably work on creating turnovers more than anybody else in practice they dont blow the whistle whether it takes 20 30 40 seconds until they strip the ball out of the running backs hands and it s paid off for ball of <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> s tenure going back to old for third and seven the pass is caught up on nexus spin around away from children and he s forced out of bounds at the 10yard line i tell you what this is an awesome route by a king knicks watch him at the top of this as he s catching the ball he s going to make a move he catches as it s coming into his hands he ducks his shoulders to the left the defensive back reacts that way he spins back to the outside that is a savvy move for a young player got <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tillman</person> completely beautiful dianne s numberone pick in the o9 draft at a north carolina 29th overall first down they spotted it 212 and madness rosie saw dj more the corner coming uncontested on a blitz he saw it and just threw it into the ground and complete you know he s interesting he like threw that one away but i thought it had a chance youll see dj more coming off this side but see if hell i had lobbed this over the top there really wasnt anybody left back there he was going to have some blockers and i think <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> had a little room to run because <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> came on to blitz nothing really back there second down and 10 the ball at the 12 they give it to a mod he stumbles as he tries to cut it back to the left third down <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> will get credit for the tackle go ahead a lot of things going on up front now for the chicago bears of course tommy harris has been such a great player al over the years and was so instrumental in their super bowl run but he s no longer starting he had a really bad performance against the dallas cowboys who s sat out a week ago in active back in there now and he really needs to make an impression <person player="marcus harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> also <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry</person> milken number 69 with a longer defensive front and back field matt manning throws for and it s <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> who gets taken down at the 4 yard line so it will be a couple of yards shy of the first down with four minutes to go in the quarter fourth and two and in comes times in the field goal group yeah i think this is the right move for sure this is just the typical tampa 2 defense that the bears love to play and theyre gonna allow you that kind of a route inside in that situation nice job by <person player="david diehl" race="white" position="OG">david</person> deal on the outside against <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> and well try to keep an eye on him i dont know what he was working on over there on the sidelines but something is bothering it <person player="lawrence tynes" race="white" position="K">lawrence tynes</person> this will be a 22 yard field goal attempt and the giants get on the board on a drive it started at their 23 nothing new york with three and a half to go in the quarter for the complete sunday night experience check out sunday night football extra on nbc sportscom a lot of good stuff kind of looks like that and that kind of looks like andy rove estelí giants defensive end back in the late 50s and early 60s great player great giant teams during that era part of the new ring of honor for the giants and it fell 1974 feels it by <person player="johnny knox" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnny</person> coming into jai s carry him his juris <person player="gerris wilkinson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wilkinson</person> so the giants who are not getting still away on their special teams get a big pop right there on home mic marchmay had scientists offensive mastermind he s been called a lot of things mostly positive because of what he s done offensively you can see how all of the teams she has gone to how they have improved especially those 99 rams when he came in under dick vermeil ran the offense and they went to the super bowl marcus <person player="jmarcus webb" race="UNK" position="OT">webb</person> comes in the he had a west texas ament seventh round draft choice the offensive throw out the ball at the 21yard for the giants to a good start defensively tonight <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> is there to make the tackle you know it s interesting <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> is i think without question the best player on this giants defense from the ability to do everything and yet even <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> his had some poor plays lately and they really need him to be a superstar you cant say he hasnt played well he just hasnt played great yet and if the giants are going to get this turned around he has to be great of 13 yards at the hester on the strain when he gets knocked down by his own man <person player="edwin williams" race="nonwhite" position="C">edwin williams</person> knocks him down well short of the first down we talked about warrants and what he s done but the other thing that morris does because he is such a riverboat gambler in a way take a look at that turnover is between 99 and o5 his team s had the most sacks fit most beau 607 of the liens secondmost in turnover his most sacks and then with the 49ers no8 most in bulk categories so giveth and taketh he gained this a lot he takes a lot of risks you can say he s reckless he says im aggressive not reckless 35 by <person player="terrell thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">terrell thomas</person> and it is picked off and then he s tackled the spot at which he intercepted the pass so thomas is going to get credit before the pick and then tackled as he makes the interception youre gonna see <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg olsen</person> come across and i have no idea what <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> s watching perfect protection <person player="terrell thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">terrell thomas</person> just sitting out there in that two deep zone he never saw this he absolutely never saw that and you talked about the combination but mike martz and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> is potentially combustible big plays potentially combustible bad plays and you saw it there less than two minutes to go in the quarter trying the pile but picks up three yards with a forward lean and there is march and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> in the bears right now with a total of 11 plays for 19 yards us for the first quarter and i have no idea what it is with <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> but he doesnt have a great record playing at night any i dont think he s won a game in primetime yet on the road so this is a a tough combination in those early sacks there like sort of body blows to a boxer they add up they get inside your mind a little bit and you start watching that rush instead of looking down the field we should see now and that s a really bad mistake the traffic you trying to thread it to <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> covering on the play and it will be third and seven for the giants one of the things the bears love to do is the pressure inside and make you think that <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> is going to blitz but more often than not he shows that and then backs out of it but he has been so athletic this year i think you almost have to go back to 2005 when he was the defensive player of the year to find the same level that he s been running around and making plays so far this year in there theyre down in shrub that s like pepper step support the players whistled dead neutral zone infraction number 90 of the defense his action into the neutral the reaction by the five yard penalty third down and that makes it third down and two back to 23 yeah and if i were tom coughlin id be upset that i didnt get my free plate yes im just thinking the same thing you know because <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> stopped on the outside plus they had a mod <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> over to that side and so they would have had this picked up he s going backwards but i guess once mackenzie jumped it forced him to blow the whistle at that point back when it s number 90 youre always thinking about other babies third and two and that bass is too high and through the hands of <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> the giants get the interception and then cant get a first down and well have to settle for a field goal attempt of about 38 yards one of the things that giants are gonna do is move <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">kevin boss</person> to get him to <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> side that time theyve faked the block on <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> and send them out in the flat and for professional receivers and quarterbacks got to be able to make that <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> will hold it <person player="lawrence tynes" race="white" position="K">lawrence tynes</person> will try to make it six to nothing and that kick is no good bending to the left 58 ticks left the bears get away with one very nothing giants giants and bears banging heads for 85 years the founders george halas and tim mehra some of the names red grange mel heinz sid luckman the quarterback sam huff for the giants sweetness of course bill parcells with a the two super bowl victories the giants and the bears virginia mccaskey daughter of george halas who was the the coach of this team as well as the owner for 40 of those years in for ten year increments go back to the the kick the hole by <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">matt dodge</person> was anything but perfect and might have had a little something to do with the fact that the kicked went wide left here it is dont forget <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">matt dodge</person> is already fumbled a punt and that was pretty unsteady you want to get that thing down and turn the laces <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chester</person> tailors so <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> comes out tailor was picked up from minnesota that a great job especially in third down situations coming in for <person player="adrian tracy" race="UNK" position="DE">adrian</person> peterson but he hasnt really been much of a factor here you know the the running game for the bears really has not been very good at all and <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> essentially is the same kind of player that <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chester taylor</person> is so there s not a great need for that third down back here maybe like they had with minnesota and you know minnesota s missing him right now second down and six it does you got a full start here false start number 68 offense fiveyard penalty second down franco may yell moving over to that left tackle spots that can call on him tonight well a lot of the movement up front on this offensive line has started when <person player="chris williams" race="nonwhite" position="OT">chris williams</person> got hurt he was supposed to be the left tackle so they had to take <person player="frank omiyale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">frank</person> oatmeal from right tackle the left tackle <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">roberto garza</person> move from right guard to left guard kevin schafer goes in they like this jamarcus web a lot of moving parts up front and at least so far it s showing up into the quarter the score 3 nothing giants and when the meadowlands to these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico starting the second quarter al michaels with cris collinsworth and andrea kramer look at x squared but eight air miles away beautiful shot of the new meadowlands stadium and he s struggling new jersey across him the parking lot on where the old saying stood jessica <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> is the backup second laid on the outside by the tightend <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg</person> olson like to split him quite a bit <person player="terrell thomas" race="UNK" position="DB">terrell thomas</person> making the tackle itll be third down and seven it s kind of interesting that when the bears start having protection problems mike martz instead of bringing people in the block spreads them out he wants <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> to be able to see what s happening and just like in the dallas game when <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> was a little unsettled he went back to the spread sort of a look and let him make some quick clothes to get his vision backwards protection in the form of <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> in montana hit and fruits comes up with it because oc human yura almost forced an interception or a turnover in the bears are lucky that couch was right there and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> is still down on one day boy did he take a shot and here s why you spread it out you bring <person player="frank omiyale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">frank</person> olson in who s much more of a receiving tight end than a blocking tight end no way in the world he s going to be able to bring down ocu manyara and oc got there big time the bears have been extremely lucky but this game isnt close to over at this point with the kind of mistakes theyve been making up front blocking goes into the books as a sack three of them to the giant d tonight pick 26yard it s bottled up at the 30yard line <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli manning</person> coming in and taking over for kurt warner back in in o4 and he had burris of course he had tumor &amp; shaki as his main three that first generation of receivers and now he s got <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> lost the tight end manning him and <person player="hakeem nicks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hakeem nicks</person> and of course the numbers are better with these new receivers and a lot that has to do with <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> s maturity as well no question but i do think that leadership starts to kick in a little bit as well when you have a young quarterback and veteran receivers believe me theyre not listening to him there the 30yard line and manning goes chicago s first sack of the night a kris who would have thought as they work on coupler on the sidelines here we are in the third of october if the giants win tonight there will be one undefeated team of the 32 in the national football league the kansas city chiefs parody reigns supreme and the nfl but this is you know it s what we have but you still have to think that the pittsburgh steelers with what theyve shown so far without ben roethlisberger now they get him back if youre looking for a team in my mind is sort of sticks out a little bit early on that would be the day they always lay on the table without ben ben washington screams shut up <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> it s taken down after a gain of just a couple itll be third and 18 <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> make you the tackle and <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> a guy that <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> just loves he says that you know weve got a lot of good young players up there and i want to say anything bad about anybody now i know what <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> is gonna do on every play if there s a big play a big moment in the ball game i want him in there i trust him that much i know what he s going to give me harris s in force <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> printed a 34yard line six yards short of the first down and no punt it s kind of interesting watching tommy harris work up front ive never seen a lack of effort and any of the things that he s done so far but so many times when ive been watching on tapes somehow or another he ends up on the ground or cyber just kind of throws him down and moves on down the field but tommy harris for this defense to be really good he has to be really good that gods our rookie from east carolina line drive one hopper to hester and hester were trying to turn the corner and the giants are able to force him out of bounds and you could hear the crowd holding its collective breath as <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> sends a one hop i drive to pester normally lethal not there a lot on tom coughlin s mind of course lately one of the things probably paramount would be special teams because you take a look at the problems the giants have had and he had this juggle by renauldi got away with that he had dodged their 7th round draft choice and he was able to get away with that and then times hooking one and the giants the coverage hasnt been good the return game is not good it s made a big difference that <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> may not survive the night 35 yard line and he s been a good dad again and the ball is loose tough got him and this is for tang who s able to cover it up so again they get the couple the giant is putting enormous pressure on up front and that s the fourth sack of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> in the first 19 minutes of the game but once again trying to block a defensive end with a tight end and <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin</person> talk makes brandon manu mollie oona looked bad <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> has got to figure this out the bears and mike martz love holding the ball and letting their guys work down the field but it s obvious at this point that will not work you cannot hold that ball in that seven step drop against this pass rush of the giants in the forecast ball for the possibility of sprinkles right now second at 22 bottled up no rule at war in the middle it s chris canthey having a good first half itll be third down a 19 in the drizzle there it is maybe that s what bears and giants are supposed to do rains and bring out some great veteran football players and the put up in the ring of fame get out your poncho s and all somehow we went from summer right to winter we passed coal welcome to the netherland stepping up look it s the shaq bundle three sacks from him five in the game beyond <person player="deon grant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">grant</person> with the recovery it s not <person player="frank omiyale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">frank</person> oneill s fault this is good protection over here he s going to force human year to run all the way by <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> s got to get rid of the ball i mean that had to be close to five six seconds that he was trying to hold that ball now i could see it if he hadnt been hit yet but he s been hit on almost every play i cant explain it cannot explain you mahurin has been waiting all day for sunday night because we had him to send the night game against philadelphia in the hole seven and a at six sacks that night he is three tonight five already for the giants another turnover but the giants the good news for the bears is theyre only down three humanure he s in a good mood and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> and he s not and this has been a struggle five sacks already ties his careerhigh and now all the giants have to do is put them away but remember this is a giants offense last week that had 471 yards of offense and only scored 10 points so theyve got struggles of their own turned over as killing him 2nd down and the backup corner knocking them down you know chris coming into the game speaking of the the bears defense and getting up slowly here his <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> what were they gonna do without matthias <person player="mathias kiwanuka" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kiwanuka</person> well theyve done pretty well with that back to the office done alright here s dj more out here and when <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> couldnt get that 8th guy down more and more in the league one of the things that i really see is those wide receivers everybody talks about the 8th man in the box all that kind of stuff you better be able to get that guy if you want to run a injury timeout for <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> the meadowlands stadium or certainly ten <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">boss</person> out of the game <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person> flanks manning in the backfield waiting for the snap moving the hands and the bears came across the line false start number 76 offense fiveyard penalty third down chris knee reminds me we were talking to <person player="rich seubert" race="white" position="OT">rich</person> seibert the other day who the other guard so he calls himself soi bird when he introduces himself so i said then what are yo you soy bird or seibert he said well it s it goes back and forth in our family i said ill tell you what well do you make a good play and youll be cyber you get a penalty youll be soy bird he says if i get a penalty call me chris <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> that penalty was on the real chris need third and 15 devin bosses back in reaching for his shoulder as well miscommunication there <person player="henry melton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">henry melton</person> put the heat on manning and the giants bringing the picking group in yeah one of the problems when you show that double a blitz watch christy take a half a step down here to his left because he s a little bit worried about <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">briggs</person> coming in half step and then milton beats them round the other way that s why the bears do that they like to show that pressure right up the middle make those offensive linemen think inside and allow their tackles to jump outside giants could try a 52yard field goal instead it s going to be a punt within that 182 each that because that s 14 yards next still pretty nothing human yura three sacks tonight 52 and a half in his career dancing to the music yeah he s been dancing all night mostly around franco me yo little night vision for you here i gotta like this thing gives you a chance to look at ocd from your earth the pressure he s been getting maybe we should call this things good night vision because for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> that s what it s been feeling like people trying to knock him out all night long and you can see oh me yell he is just turning his shoulders and sprinting backwards and nothing s very effective i think youre going to see the bears come out and start spreading this thing out and just allowing the ball to get out of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> s hands a little bit he cannot hold it at that 10 step drop the outside yds carell thomas comes up to make the tackle the second down and three as we approach the halfway <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark</person> of the second quarter yeah i think if you want to say there s a big question <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark</person> about the bears you know they will get some different kind of weather in chicago as we move along here are they good enough with this remade offensive line and their current running game to win games in poor weather and this is a pretty good test of it here tonight second hi issues well start number 82 offense fiveyard penalty second down and you know how that s really a killer you got a big run on first down youre gonna have second and two so you can play pass you can run you can get your offensive line moving forward a little bit and now youre right back to them you know second so from the 23 yard line short drop that that the secondary joke scoot out of bounds at the 21 yard line he s run out by <person player="barry cofield" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cofield</person> heya cory <person player="corey webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> s been doing a nice job so far <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> was trying to get a quick went into <person player="johnny knox" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnny knox</person> but once again an <person player="antrel rolle" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antrel rolle</person> ran underneath that one but for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> if i were mike marks id say listen i call threestep drop you either throw on three steps on those plays something officially that goes now is a sacrilege that is the six shack of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> and even seen that s becoming slick turf and that is tough there and the giants have not put him down seven times well the the tough part now is and i saw this a little in the dallas game two as youre starting to see <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> s eyes dropped and here s <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> right here but now youll see <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> he s no longer a believer once he starts to slip now his eyes are coming down to the pass rushers and you really cannot do the quarterback he s just holding that way <person player="brad maynard" race="white" position="P">maynard</person> out of the engine cheese on the chicago side of the field when rolls out near midfield giants will get good field positions if they can take advantage of it this time still only three nothing new york empire state building situating the skyline the giant snout of the wall before the 7yard line on first down <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">anderson</person> hitchcock you could take him down out of bounds by <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> emperor very short gain and piece of tea no he s samoa second down all right here we go at tommy harris in the middle again here good job by the giants up front sort of passing him off he does hustle get back into the ball and for tommy harris it s been a bit of an embarrassing time it s his buddy lance brick said that he has been humbled by the fact that he was sent to the bench and expected a fiery performance from behind and here comes <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> creates the sack crumble and the bears get the turnover id say what somebody put a tent over this circus this is unbelievable and it s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> with the sack and fumble and her locker with the recovery <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> with 507 to go it s the ball back for chicago and for <person player="david diehl" race="white" position="OG">david</person> deal it has been a tough year for the pro bowler that was a season ago and for <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> he said he would test the waters with both tackles i think he s already made his decision about which side he s going to play against he s going to find <person player="david diehl" race="white" position="OG">david</person> deal as often as possible and if coughlin s going to challenge was his arm coming forward new york is challenging the ruling on the field that the ball was fumbled well review the play timeout so jeffers well take a look coughlin is the best that challenges he s been successful almost half the time in his career were back in this call figures to stand these as we look at it call jeffers making the call after review the ruling on the field is confirmed the ball was knocked loose prior to any forward motion by the arm new york will be their first church but remember if youre coming forward with it with the empty hand and in this particular case here s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> he gets to the ball even before <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> starts to move the arm forward and this lodges the ball at the apex right there and so it s pretty clear that it was going to be a sack fumble and a recovery by <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> and it s chicago s ball at the 48 yard line this is incredible whole field sacks of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> chicago tonight that s their 21st play and theyre averaging less than a yard a play well no biking blocking air comes go field and he s basically going to have two guys on him and he just splits the difference between <person player="olin kreutz" race="white" position="C">olin kreutz</person> and lance lewis and why they continue to throw the ball i dont know before that play they add 15 passes 44 yards and you can make it about minus 11 or 12 now you saw mike tyson offensive line codes he has to be thrilled what life is coming there chicago tonight has run 22 plays five yards wow lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> believe it or not he likes this kind of game takes a defense and the turnovers and sacks and you know let s so this is good for him this is just going to be a strange night out this is one of those nights baby decided by the punters only thing love you can like is that the way the bears have played theyre only down three to nothing you dont want to turn it over here now third and 18 cold feeling the run amount of bounds and <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> just flips the ball away so that started at the 40yard line that he step out before the the 40 and im only saying this because statistically that would be another sack well let s take a look at what s going on the back end to make him hold on to the boyars <person player="johnny knox" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnny knox</person> trying to get down the field he s cover here s <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> on the other side theyve got people all around him and they just kind of waiting around the giants love seeing this fourman rush working like this <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> actually got rid of the pole just before he stepped out of bounds and this a short cut brought by renaud and they now change it and theyre gonna say that was he stepped out of bounds before he threw it away so that goes in as a sack meanwhile sunday night football bring brought to you by the new forest light silver bullet of aluminum paint by nissan inviting you to shift the way you move by at&amp;t rethink possible and by subway restaurants try the newest fivedollar footlong sunrise subway melt on a pink in the house great cause breast cancer awareness and there s this whole month of october is breast cancer awareness great stuff holly <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> were very involved in to the outside goes <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> and again and oh to breast cancer awareness now i want to sleep as many people get screened as as possible and the nfl not just lip service to this cause contributing their money and selling shirts and a lot of good stuff a lot of ladies watching the nfl these days and we certainly appreciate that and paying tribute to them the ballers of the <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> two and a half and just to go back to <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> again when you step out of bounds and you behind the line of scrimmage and youre flushed out it s a sack so officially in this half nine sacks for the giants you know and kind of out of nowhere you know you would have thought with matthias <person player="mathias kiwanuka" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kiwanuka</person> their tops a kurd coming in being injured and not hero see human europe didnt even practice much this week because he had a bad knee some question whether he was going to play and of course they had nine sacks <person player="rocky bernard" race="nonwhite" position="DT">rocky bernard</person> down as well with an injury third down shannon <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> bobbles it incomplete and that takes us to the twominute warning nothing officially at the 157 one giant s three weird one at the netherlands so the halftime show coming up donovan mcnabb goes back to philadelphia as a redskin and wins baltimore pulls one out tonight pittsburgh from the ranks of the unbeaten dan <person player="patrick mannelly" race="white" position="OT">patrick</person> updating the michael vick injuries he cannot top finish the game and bob costas takes a look at ladainian tomlinson big <person player="david diehl" race="white" position="OG">david</person> the flow and here s the reason a dress to <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> down in the tenderer for and hester is gonna skirt the sideline the 45yard butterflying is all the way back early in the play at the giant 41 after a 56yard booth i was holding against the chicago bears and that s <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">earl bennett</person> i think if he can read lips right there a tgirl <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bennett</person> against the bears and that s going to negate the big return for <person player="devin hester" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin hester</person> that may have been the biggest cake of that like sitting there to at least just hit it squarely to caught it and kick i thought for sure they were going to kick offense only way pete in this kind of a game is that s update for the only good news statistically for chicago is that official scoring is looking at that last <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> play and to the moment theyve taken it back to an incomplete pass as he was going get run out of bounds and he just flipped it in the air so as they look at that for the moment he s only back to eight sacks pulling on the and ive cut lorentz the call time out so theyre going to start this drive such as it is and he s forced to take a timeout ill remember the bears are 3a no you know that s that s every year you sit there and you watch it you go roar this is one of two undefeated football teams here but this may well turn it right here how they do coming out of their own end zone we talked about i mean chicago for so many years its defense and it s running the ball and then they get <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> and then they bring mike martz in and we talked about it before with moritz i mean look with the rams of course he had kurt warner coming out of nowhere he at marshall faulk he had torry holt he had a lot of great parts and he s done a nice job but the downside is sax and fix this this this is the downside from the fiveyard line first down get rid of it the hurry the catch is made up at the 11yard line as <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg</person> olson gets taken down by gough that was a good play call right there everybody in the house thinking theyre gonna run it off tackle olson in the backfield as a fullback and sneak him out that was an important play just to turn the momentum a bit giants take a timeout eight sacks tonight most and a half since october of old one tampa bay had eight against pittsburgh and that would have been in a game in which lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> would have been an assistant coach for tony dungy at tampa bay i thought do you like this kind of game but from from that side he would like it not from this side he s got a few on his side too records for a game is 12 second three excuse me <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chester taylor</person> up to the 16 and a first down you know once again nice job by <person player="craig steltz" race="white" position="DB">craig</person> olson he s had a good block and a good catch coming out here and the chicago bears they really dont believe in bringing fullbacks on the road with him they use their tight ends as blockers and weve seen mono mollie runa and <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">olsen</person> cookie block on that one there s the spread good luck then aliens a late garvey placing lance lewis <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">ross</person> becomes part of a new sack of change and that sets a record for most sex in a hand that s nine officially well your look like youre going to get out of the half and then here you go if it again count when you are going fiveman protection now youve got to throw it even if you throw that ball out of bounds when you hit that back foot think of kurt warner think of the way he ran this team you never spoke hurt warner trying to pull it down and make a play here s the routes everybody out right there you take <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bennett</person> right there youve got to be able to see that if theyre blitzing somebody is open you got to hit that back foot and throw it even if you throw it in the dirt or in the 15th row youve got to throw it and when <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> is holding that ball theyre gonna continue to blitz bears make it a big deal of hiring mike tyson minnesota head coach as their offensive line coach what s he thinking right now they should have hired mike tyson i mean you know okay that but that s not protection you know that s really not that s a corner blitz that s a slot blitz that is not on the line that is totally 1,000% on the quarterback to read it see it and get it out that s why you go spread so it s second at 17 the giants just took a timeout their last <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> is the back uchicago on this they im thinking a kneel down correct selection it s up to the 23 yard line that kind of skews the stats because they had 11 total yards until then and <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> runs for 11 so that s 22 total yards i think lovey is going to be thrilled to get out of here just down three to nothing maybe they can go fix it at halftime but this was the dispute you know love is a defensive minded guy mike martz is a shootfromthehip kind of guy and right now theyre getting shot in the hip good news for the bears right now is they dont have to run another play walk runs out that s the end of a whacky first half giants 3 bears huffing coming up on the other side of the break the toyota halftime show after these messages local nbc station oh first candy penis the one game and the pass game again and that s ocean you and your and look out from behind and here comes <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> and he gets the ball loose id say what somebody put a tent over this surface this is unbelie giants three bears nothing al michaels cris collinsworth andrew kramer at the new meadowlands stadium oh sacs in a single game a dozen done five times most recently in a sunday night game in the old stadium giants against philadelphia that i winston justice had to come in as the left tackle human yura had six sacks the giants with nine tonight and almost a 10th on a play that was ruled an incomplete fast as <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> almost in frustration just flipped the ball into the bench as he was going out of bounds otherwise that would have been another one picked up by renaud and he s able to bring that one back to the 31yard lunch we interesting what the coaches had to say andrea fill us in well l walking up the field at halftime lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> had no answers for the 9 sec s of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> other than they have to block better he said theyve tried personnel changes scheme changes nothing worked as for <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> holding the ball too long he said if youve been hit that many times youd be skittish too as for what did tom coughlin say to his punter <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">matt dodge</person> and halftime he said i just encouraged him told him to do a good job you see what happens in the second half with him and with the has been great but his office has been sputtering his <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> gets taken down by <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> the giants have now gained 97 yards in the game of the bears 22 look how athletic <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> is here goes inside <person player="david diehl" race="white" position="OG">david</person> deal and then is still able to get back outside and catch a mod <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> this guy was a phenomenal basketball player and i tell you love you <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> thinks he is just the best he said money changes some guys it just made him better second at 11 that s a strange day up at a good block and hicks were going off that that block off the screen is able to turn it into a nice little game and well be third down and three <person player="rich seubert" race="white" position="OT">rich</person> slavered seibert whatever his name is gonna come out here and make a really nice block this guy can run for a big man he used to be a titan in college they moved in left tackle and finally to guard he was probably as surprised as anybody when he originally made this new york giants football team a backup guard got injured in the final preseason game and that s how i made it count for a long time current giant in here since oh one third and three no flag coverage by <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> before merck old <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tim jennings</person> done a nice job coming in here if zach <person player="zack bowman" race="UNK" position="DB">bowman</person> got benched a week ago about in the second quarter and <person player="tim jennings" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jennings</person> came in made some big hits and made some plays just like that he also recovered that fumble at the end of the game that sort of turned it around against the green bay packers in its showtime showtime for <person player="matt dodge" race="UNK" position="P">dodge</person> again here is the rookie the hester downfield farid she gets it to the corner and out of bounds and the giants will take that <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> meanwhile has not come out of the locker room yet there s their backup the veteran <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> and he s coming into the game well well get the report on comer who hasnt come out of the locker room took some of these shots concussion is not what theyre telling us in <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> who s had a really visit the board they <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is now but i believe 16 years mainly as a backup matings was a starter with buffalo in 97 before we continue with him where did <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> get the concussion no second last play of the hammer and roll i sit on him and you can see his helmet just slammed to the ground at the end of that sack watch this a little whip right down to the ground second and seventh of all is that the the commons comes into the league he s a backup and buffalo in 1997 a million years ago he s the starting quarterback in buffalo then he goes back to the banks and he doesnt take snaps for a couple of seasons then he had a moment in the sun at the end of the oh seven seas for the with the redskins he comes in he leads him to four wins he leaves him into the playoffs for joe gibbs against seattle and one of those big wins was the most part here s a guy has been in the league 16 seasons a lot of clipboards or judge human urine and beyond grand mal matthias <person player="mathias kiwanuka" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kiwanuka</person> had been playing this role in the past now it s <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> sort of standing up here and theyre gonna try and cut them <person player="roberto garza" race="white" position="C">roberto garza</person> does but that s not going to work against an athlete like that and <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> and oc human europe their greatest danger tonight is that they run into each other shagging somebody or tackling someone where renaud takes it at the 16 yard line perfect coverage right there cory graham number 21 stopping him in his tracks manning of the giants back a lot of great former giants honored ring of honor halftime andy rova shelley saw him before why a tittle here tonight of course my old partner <person player="frank omiyale" race="nonwhite" position="OT">frank</person> gifford the great gift michael strahan flew from la to be here phil simms did the game in pittsburgh today he flew in after that game bill parcells would go in dont listen t that catch word who wasnt even at the game in miami last so we know bill is watching and congratulations to him part of the ring of honor for the giants unfilled is p santino samoa and again with <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> unhappy with his role the backup right now and tonight he s carried the ball one time chris and caught one right there well in you know get sort of a rainy wet night and you think well if theyre not going to play him tonight when will they play him and the surprising thing about <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> to me is that he s probably a better catcher of the football than <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> is i mean he really has some pretty soft hands coming out of the backfield i think most teams kind of look think of him he s gonna run it when he comes in the game take it take it down up to the 21 yard line more on brandon here s andrea well al <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> told me he s resigned to his role this season he said he doesnt care that he s not starting but he s frustrated he hasnt had the chance to be the physical back that he says he knows he can still be and that it affects him mentally and rhythm wise he told me he has not asked for a trade but he doesnt want to be back here next season under these circumstances and he didnt think the giants would want him back either probably right on both counts i would say so third down and four from the 22yard line but the past is locked down and who else julia s pepper is at six seven going up in the air batch down passes of course tremendous prowess at blocking field goal and extra point attempts and gets up in the air to bat it down now <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> gonna come out and go back come back out and jump up just doesnt matter what he does doesnt matter what either one of these offenses do at this point but i will say that sooner or later you keep taking it to that guy but the line of scrimmage short little putt out of bounds at the 42 yard line 36 yard food perhaps should be happy the should be public well you can support the nfl s a crucial catch breast cancer awareness campaign by bidding on authentic game day

position="RB">forte</person> now has carried the ball eight times for 20 yards so that s two and a half yards a carry and coming into the game it s about it yeah that s about what theyre averaging down it really has been and because of all the movement on the offensive line there really is no coordination and talking to <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> this week he said you know i understand that our running game now is more geared towards my catching little passes in open space second down and get away from foley close to picking up a first down for stop fighting so let s go back and look at <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> s first half and <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> nice job getting it out of his hands but this is what was happening to <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> he s looking left he sees the blitz he had to see <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron ross</person> there are three defensive backs three wide receivers which means that one blitzes one is open roll <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bennett</person> was wide open and i have no idea why <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> pulled it down and he got a concussion out of it you throw into the blitz if you see a blitz left you pull it that way because somebody to <person player="jonathan goff" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> goth make sure i didnt get out of the back for that well you just could have never imagined that <person player="jonathan goff" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> golf would be a factor like this in the game he thought that okay the bears were to come out throw it all over the place their plan was they were going to pick on <person player="jonathan goff" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> golf and pass coverage and instead it s turned into one two three point one two three of six first downs for the it goes out of bounds at around the 17 18 yard line referee karl jeffries will go into conference during the kick holding number 23 of the return team half the distance to the goal timeout 806 left in the third three nothing giants kind of town kind the town if i can make it it s up to you new york who else but sinatra could do what amounts to an anthem for both cities well perfect imagine if he had done one about cincinnati in their cigarette right now starla im gonna come to from the 10yard line <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> spinning around the 13 yard line id say youve watched these chicago bears attacked the backfield they have more tackles for losses on running plays than any team in the league and the way they do it is they really try to set hard edges on the outside and then they just fly those two inside linebackers through there and of course <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> former safety and <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> a guy in <person player="pisa tinoisamoa" race="UNK" position="LB">pisa</person> tino a samoa they just they just shoot straight ahead so it s tough to run against second and six away from he doesnt pick up the first down thatll make it a third and short you know now one of the tough things that you have to do for the giants and tom coughlin is this is a team that has more turnovers than anybody over the past six levy <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> has been in here so i cant lee now that one was the first well they gave him a great spot on that they put it at the 20 yard line looked like he was tackling yard shy of the first down and that s why the crowd let out that mock shearer as the giants get their fifth birthday a flock all the way down live game offense fiveyard penalty i think the giants initially thought they were going to have a third and one and then they were a little surprised to have a first and 10 ms them up to to get back to the point though just for a minute you know that the giants dont want to lose this game on offense either since 2004 lovey <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> s defense has gotten 208 takeaways nobody has come close to that and 27 percent of their points come off a turnover so you cant hand them the game here some more let s say a <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> is just a blur he s just the blur i dont know how you block he s 300 pounds and he has moves like this watch this one jump inside missed the fullback jump back outside just set it up for your guy you dont know what they paid him but wasnt enough he goes back to carolina next week you think hell be active he just said it was time for a change played out the spring with the panthers so at the night that s a neon lights play 21 yards well and theyre starting to help up front theyve brought <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn andrews</person> in to help with the protection and that allowed time for this route to get down the field that really was the key they had seven man protection up front brought in the extra offensive lineman and for the first time hell i able to sit back and survey the field a bit you see the bears going after that ball that s what in a second and 17 oh there s a big hole white chocolate backtoback first downs danielle manning the safety comes up to make the stop at the 46 you know now that were starting to get some movement up front big chris knee coming off the ball getting up to that second level right here and now when you start catching those linebackers on the other side of the line of scrimmage they also adam coates with a good job going in for <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn</person> <person player="shaun ohara" race="white" position="C">ohara</person> now the giants are starting to look like the giants perfect g open again at the 30yard to china and beautiful protection off the thing and in beckham somehow gets free amongst the court tip of the fenders for a gain of 25 and that s three consecutive first downs for the giants and because of the success running the football it comes back directly watch her lacquer take a little step up and all beckham does is just get in behind him and wait now he s going to try and get out late but he only gets about seven or eight yards depth and there it is another good cuts it back ten and <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> saves the touchdown <person player="rich seubert" race="white" position="OT">rich</person> seibert pulling and leading away and what a convoy anytime you see a guard turn the corner and start heading up the field you know you got a play cybers going to turn up the field knockout <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> and it was on starting to give this offensive lineman a chance to move down the field and for a mod <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> you see why he s playing over <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> at open field ability down the field rapidly <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> he gets cut up with i ran into manning manning looks like he had him stopped he never stopped those legs from churning and into the end zone he goes and that wraps up a 90yard eight play drive that was a thing of beauty right there giants fans gonna love that and i love cream <person player="kareem mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OT">mckenzie</person> s block out here watch him get this seal it s a hard block against a good athlete and <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> and that s really what set in the parka for <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> we had a big bumble a week ago and he s been times <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> of course who was a guy who blocks all kinds of kicks number 69 offense fiveyard penalty were on the try seibert to commit a penalty that s not a bad place to do it on the next that shows not very big but he is a physical violent kind of back he reminds me a little of the style of <person player="adrian tracy" race="UNK" position="DE">adrian</person> peterson and sometimes it gets him in trouble you know he wants to always fight for those extra yards sometimes theyre able to get their hands in there and strip that football out and there s a flag again he saw jumping up front kick was good if it s against the bears offside number 90 defense the extra point is good the 5yard penalty will be enforced on the kickoff all of a sudden a drive full gown the beauty for the giants tended up in new york legacy club giants the superbowl lombardi s the bus of the fabled new york giants while the great franchises in the history of american sports tigers kick and shoot davis hold on back to the touchdown no it s just fun to watch somebody run with this kind of heart that yall is gonna get hit early and you know manning gets a good shot on him and chris knee just kind of carries them into the end zone and then you know he always say he s a slashing runner there you go straight from faxon avenue yeah would be the new craze illegal sell any merchandise the 20 <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chester taylor</person> stars as the running back it s only good for three yards second and seven are going to be joined us lake <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> had a first half as did the bears offense to forget suffered or sustained a concussion and so <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> was made 10 stars in a 16year career when ten years between starts but had a fantastic end of the 2007 season in washington has to lead the bears and he s down by ten but this is his kind of game this short read it get it out he can do this second down at six oh and his arm comes forward in the is picked up by <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> the giants are gonna try to say that complete fast michael boldi put the heat on him and if his arm was coming forward he thrown to the ground position complete well one of the reasons they bring that kind of pressure up the gaps like that is it forces those backs and tight ends to step up and try and make that play but at some point theyve got to get settled on this offensive line to your quarterback six and an empty backfield white the pocket hose intended for pester fourthdown well that s the most time that weve seen the quarterback hat <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> had immediate throw out in the flat and if i had been watching what i had seen in the first half i think i would have thrown it right away instead he tried to throw it the other way and that s not really his game at this age to throw those 20 yard comebacks and he came up short on is a low liner the 32 yard line last week a lot of folks tuned in for the premiere of law and order in los angeles and you can catch another new episode this wednesday at 10:00 eastern pacific 9 central and mountain right here on nbc times square always bustling so is new meadowlands stadium tonight flag down on the last play 82,000 is the capacity here here s jefferies number 21 of the kicking team illegal went out of bounds came back in and was the first to touch the ball that s illegally touch that 5yard penalty will be added to the end of the play 1st down giants all right that s cory graham bears bench take a look at that as we get it s a visual eavesdropping here what do you make of it they gave up a touchdown you could say anything they drove her down your throat you know it s like okay i got it it s not that hard shouldnt see any smiling faces im not from the 37 yard line now with 16 carries and 86 yards a good many of those on that last drive <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> makes attack on them we ticked down toward the final minute of the third quarter tell you the bears defensive ends make a lot of plays that time <person player="mark anderson" race="nonwhite" position="DE">mark anderson</person> coming down the line you just wonder maybe if <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> is starting to think a little bootleg action here anytime theyre crashing that hard to try and stop the run you have some opportunities well <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person>on <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> over the years it looked good early on you always saw the huge numbers and even 2008 a lot of big runs in that one five yards per carry 53 jacob starts to go down a little bit three point seven two <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> s four point eight so <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> stay pretty consistent it s jacob s that sort of fallen off top down to 22 seconds theyre down in four intended for <person player="hakeem nicks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hakeem nicks</person> and the giants will punt well this is really what you want now if youre the giants i mean youre looking across the way and got tot <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> and they havent been able to move it three feet tonight and so go turn it over dont make it easy your defense is doing great just ride that horse for another quarter and youre tied for first place in their division booming that kick at the five and he still cant get a break i think what he hit that one better he hit it much better as he did that s why they they drafted on 57yard boot but only 37 net eight seconds remaining in the quarter the giants sacks tonight all nine of them ive seen youre in numbers look like that yeah everybody feeding frenzy out there tonight and again one of the line story lines coming into the game the highest <person player="mathias kiwanuka" race="nonwhite" position="DE">kiwanuka</person> who had led the team before sex not playing worried about them for the rest of the season inside in this hand they give it the pesto on the end and he s able to turn the corner 31 yard line and that will be enough for a first down with one tick left in the quarter and as soon as they spotted go whine the clock and that will do it for a quarter number three and two three it s the giants and the bears nothing and sunday night continues to these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico as you look at the empire state building in manhattan now michaels cris collinsworth andrew kramer fourthquarter tend to nothing giants against the so the rookie draft choice number one out of south florida it was the middle linebacker goth coming in <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> also ran into the back and let s see if it s going to be roughing the passer college did take a hit after 2000 by the giants on the play and it s the necessary roughness late hit number 54 after the interception that penalty is declined personal foul roughing the passer number 54 that s it exactly you dont want to hit no it s not this place started to fall apart when <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> got in a way of <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> and no question about it one of the things that happens to pass rushers is they want to get their arms up sometimes but that s just helmettohelmet but what <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> presnap here saw the blitz coming from <person player="antrel rolle" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antrel rolle</person> tried to jump across the face of <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> watch him come this way and run into <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> and basically create this issue to start with and then another foul after the <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">pierrepaul</person> and those that behind i was able to adjust looking for the sidelines to hold it in at the 35 yard line boy what a throw that was by <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> you talking about a veteran look here watch him working against bo lee here down the field back shoulder all the way perfectly executed it s amazing they can add that kind of timing i guarantee it <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> hasnt thrown that ball to <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg</person> olson maybe once since training camp ended that is a great point foley s got him completely covered on the inside <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> goes to the outside good sutton in the middle and that pass is incomplete the pressure on it second at 10:00 well we have seen some better pass protection out of the chicago bears and mostly it s been <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> who s gone over and helping franco me yell his best he can over here because obviously they couldnt just let ocu monroe take out all their quarterbacks when forcing oc to kind of use those bull rushes now instead of the sweet second for the giants if im not mistaken that s that same exact play they blew a week ago you would be correct starts to drizzle again after the interception on the pass intended for olson dion <person player="deon grant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">grant</person> one of the new giants say a lot of problems at safety last year so they picked them up ninth year in the league at a tennessee vol is it and then <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> is able to make the yards on the far sideline itll be second down and one <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve smith</person> really a terrific route runner and youll see him finish this over here on the end of that play a lot of receivers will stop coming back to the ball right there who s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> weve been a little quieter and happy to get the help from his back second one speech really pepper s <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">peppers</person> would have had him down for about a third and four and instead he spins away and moves the chains way <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> with this inside move has just been wearing people out coming in here off the edge and they just cant get a body on him i mean he makes everybody miss coming through but that time he happened to miss the tackle pretty amazing it s not often you can see a guy make one guy miss but he has consistently made two blockers this pretty much all night narayan hits the ground going back to the <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> pick chris because we talked about the fact <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is barely played him and even though he s been in the league for so long that s the first interception that <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> has thrown since 1997 get out of here that we ought to show it then if it s that sort of historic they throw it here it is you know last week <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> threw an interception on the same sort of middle read route and the discussion was should <person player="greg olsen" race="white" position="TE">greg</person> olson have gone underneath that dropping linebacker last week and he looked a little hesitant at the top end of that approach tot columns conversation puts the builder oh oh and is off the ground incomplete that was a huge bravery lie right there <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">brian urlacher</person> got there got a hand on the ball that thing was floating around like the one earlier in the game and the bears just unable to convert it they had this one another great tip ball going straight up in the air and somehow that lands an open feel you saw her attacker he was like that s got to be a touchdown coming back our way and they need a break like that said before even though manning s had some deflected interception just as he had that about the pass deflected at the line of scrimmage on to tonight and that s to build back 10 seibert again to leading the way and set up perfectly because the heat was on and manning waited and it s branch only had a lot of running room well this time they bring the slot blitz again off the edge <person player="dj moore" race="UNK" position="DB">dj moore</person> is going to come in here and you cant have a more perfect call than this pressure to your right screen to your right and look out chris need down the field leading away along with <person player="rich seubert" race="white" position="OT">rich</person> soi burt that s a big first down and <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> a writhing and pain on the ground after that last play branch left ankle that means <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> the fumble in the penetration that time and that was <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> who sit and the beers kick a tremendous turnover i told you about <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> early on and he takes advantage of the replacement adam coats this thing really never came close youre going to see <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">adams</person> breaking through the backfield and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> i think had his eye on <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> right and just peeled away a little bit from that handoff and as he did that his arms closed down without the ball and there s the break that the bears were the giant the first pass away that s <person player="dave tollefson" race="white" position="DE">dave</person> thomason see we can check out <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> eyes as he s taking in the handoff and he knows that <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">adams</person> is right there let s take a look <person player="anthony adams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">anthony adams</person> coming in there and you could see <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> trying to really stretch to get that ball because really <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> was breaking away before the handoff was made and it just created the confusion you can see clamped down his hands before he had the ball in his done running room he takes the ball to the 22 yard line remember <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> shakin <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> back on the bench after the fumble third down and three with 11 and a half to go and theyve got a calm <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person> down weve already seen earlier this year he got mad through his helmet apparently accidentally threw it in the stands in indianapolis but this game may now on his shoulders as they the outside is <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">forte</person> covered on the play by michael bully and so theyll bring in one of the best kickers in the league and <person player="robbie gould" race="white" position="K">robbie gould</person> trying to make it a seven point game let s say a michael bully has been a huge pickup when you get into these kinds of games against passing teams and really good receiving backs like they have in <person player="matt forte" race="nonwhite" position="RB">matt forte</person> to have a linebacker on your squad that can cover those guys mantoman his huge and he was in perfect position that time two consecutive regulations from 40 or less this one is 40 and make it fifty three so they cash in on the <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> fumble did three points make it a onepossession game again they finally get on the board through the bears and three giants next sunday night candlestick park in san francisco philadelphia against the 49ers and most of you know michael vick was burke today chest and ribs xrays negative football nine starts at 7:00 eastern time mri tomorrow so well see about vick and the 49ers lost about as excruciating a game as conceivable today only launched the lead with two seconds to go see all the time atlanta had the lead and the falcons won the game off to a strange year this year in the nfl arent we i tell you san francisco not many people would have picked down at this point the video and for nfc s leader to be robbi up to the 30yard line giant savage 1052 left new york 5 a touchdown sunday night football brought to you by ge capital by hyundai maker of the 2010 genesis the vehicle that does everything better by the home depot and by sprint the now network mr daya don bosco prep beat the bergen catholic 3818 always like a little local trek color don bosco prep i think won the national championship were season throws the <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> back in the game by nyx <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> there it is with the now technically that fumble with where <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> loses the ball it s charged to manning because they always contribute it or debit the quarterback on a quarterback halfback exchange so it s a manning fumble even though the man on the left was slightly complicitous may give the quarterbacks credit for every one second and two at the 38 yard line we would have been the first downline backs up and gets hit there and that s gonna spot the ball about a half yard away from a first down tell you this <person player="hakeem nicks" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hakeem nicks</person> has some sticky hands doesnt he this was some catch he comes in looks like he s coming so stop and has to reach back out catch it and is still making a move the thing that i really like about him is he s making moves as he catches the ball and that really makes it tough on those defensive players because theyre sort of watching the ball too and pretty impressive <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> he s back in now on third down and one contacted the line of scrimmage and then he plows through tackled by <person player="marcus harrison" race="nonwhite" position="DT">harrison</person> to first down okay then youre starting to see some of the power package here <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">shawn andrews</person> comes in over here the tight end and watch him cave this down this is what theyve been looking for they think <person player="shawn andrews" race="UNK" position="OT">andrews</person> ultimately could end up being a guy that could play tackle for them and this was kind of close let s see if <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> room he almost lost the ball again watch the <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> as the ball will get spotted just short of a first down and <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> has now gained over a hundred yards it s 106 on 20 totes and we were talking about it <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> likes to crash down on those runs so that s that little quick flip to get it out there and there may be one defensive end game that can run down a mod branch on that play and it was necessary carrie at 20 on opening day against carolina tang a careerhigh but a first down of the 45 yard line let s check in with andrea well were not getting any more official word from the bears about jacob there s a concussion but i texted general manager jerry angela who told me that <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> had symptoms at halftime and they rolled him out i asked him if <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> would travel home from the team with the team and he replied i believe he will all right so im sure there he is right then we think that s exactly where it took place toward the end of the first half on the sack by <person player="aaron ross" race="UNK" position="DB">aaron ross</person> boy carolina at sunday like spears left fix knicks and that s another nine yard game to the giants picking up nice little chunks of yardage here and using the clock very effectively halfway through the quarter and the bears really have no choice now but to start bringing their safeties down and playing some single coverage youll see chris eyre is now starting to creep down to help against the run and that puts these corners out there one on one and that s not really what this team is built to do they prefer to not put that kind of pressure on their corners good read by <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> realizing that now the bears are changing up a bit second down and magic and you could see him doing practice strip strip strip fumble turnover while on a turnaround that was some play at the end of this one and now we talked about it earlier you can see <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> he s thinking about it he just does not see <person player="zack bowman" race="UNK" position="DB">bowman</person> they practice that that is no accident those punch outs <person player="charles tillman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles tillman</person> does it all the time <person player="brian urlacher" race="white" position="LB">urlacher</person> got one last week to to save that game against the packers so the bears get it back at their one whereas lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> freezes turnovers tom coughlin has always preached ball security so in the first time in his 15 yorkers a head coach three or more giveaways in four consecutive games that and for take it out of the he can and we go back to the fumble one it looked like it was going to be a touchdown the next thing you know is chicago s wall and the thing that <person player="zack bowman" race="UNK" position="DB">bowman</person> did was he gave him no idea that he was there he didnt try to tackle him first to tip it off and watch <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> i think he s looking up at the video screen it almost didnt see that in time nope second straight week with a inside down at the line of scrimmage that <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">steve</person> and that s his second back down in his half there was no choice but <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear</person> ecofield got some immediate pressure and <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> had to get that sucker out of there this splits the gap as you just cant the bears are just unsettled up on too many changes too many different things like thanks a lot his hands full their punter is nothing else at fort is that giant defense stops them again <person player="jonathan goff" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jonathan</person> gough is first in so it s going to be a very short snap and a real fast dick id say perry fuels defensive team they were good last week even though that gave him some yards but this week theyve been incredible over 12 now on third down conversions part of the chicago bears hold for 12 that s the only reason right now the new york giants are winning in the game the main initiative away back to the 32 yard line to the giants great field position with 521 and trying to take some time off the quad this week with tonight s show put arnett terrence howard white s gonna be there katherine heigl as well weeknights right here on nbc on white that was one of the most amazing things i ever saw going out to that halfpipe yep absolutely incredible and a great guy yep <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> is the running back here the catch is mixed he s going to try adjusted on the coverage by zachary moment and that s 30 yards of the first and goal first things first watch <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> here with the blitz pickup last week he cut a guy this week he goes high and <person player="eli manning" race="white" position="QB">eli</person> has time to throw it down the field there he is again stick him on those hands heck of a catch so for <person player="zack bowman" race="UNK" position="DB">bowman</person> good one bad look at this guy he is i really enjoy watching him play he has a bit of magic and jenkins poses into the end zone for a giants touchdown now <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person> im sure a little angry himself good doubleteam <person player="kareem mckenzie" race="UNK" position="OT">mckenzie</person> with a nice block inside and for <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> weve been waiting for a moment like that we needed <person player="lance briggs" race="nonwhite" position="LB">lance briggs</person> couldnt stop to the point to the giants getaway of the think about that turnover in chicago at the one the short kick good field position pass the next <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacobs</person> takes to them it s a 14point game offensive coordinator kevin gilbride and both manning shoulder is saged rosenthal s we came over to be the backup quarterback from minnesota and a nice drive there short quick drive after the turnover the giants without 325 yards total in the game 77 for the chicago bears it s fielded a big 12 yard breaks it back out to 28 now let me just maybe tell you a little bit about look at some of the yards by corner of the old one theyre not so good but <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> who played in the first half before <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> came in came in averaging almost 10 yards per attempt i mean this is an offense that was really good coming in here which was number one in the nfl he had already thrown for 870 yards and they cant even convert a third down the defensell is my now <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> there whoa yeah and <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is really shaken up as boldly came in and <person player="caleb hanie" race="white" position="QB">caleb hanie</person> is their number three quarterback and with <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">cutler</person> out with a concussion and <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> clearly in distress right now that is the most likely scenario is heaney gets loose on the sideline the giants obviously would no fear now theyre going to send <person player="michael boley" race="nonwhite" position="LB">michael boley</person> off the slot here and <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">todd collins</person> obviously never sees them and it has been an ugly night for chicago <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear</person> quarterbacks so itll be second and five and handing you some seven career passes all of them last season we ties the laces you know christ it s so funny from one week to the next the bears come in we talked about the fact they were fortunate i mean calvin johnson with the premature celebration on opening day they played a very effective and efficient game against dallas to win that one last week they have the 18 penalties for green bay and they win the game and they get a lot of breaks and they come into this game saying you know why were better than that even though theyre through you know and look a concern right now on the faces of the chicago stat but now <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> is he is able to at least sit up the jolty takes here from behind its boldi and oftentimes just like <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> it hits one thing but how your head hits this turf is often the other and a lot of times when you get your arms and like he did there and you end up falling down there s no way to keep your head from whipping and hitting the ground so haney in his third season at a colorado state and he s been the number three quarterback which means youre in effect inactive unless you have injuries to the first two and that s the case right here and you can come into the fourth quarter as well and looks like <person player="todd collins" race="white" position="QB">collins</person> may be trying to gather himself and get back into the game of he can second down and five that would figure huh it s <person player="johnny knox" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnny</person> moxon he s been silent tonight and he makes the catch at the 42 yard line <person player="chester taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> payne he looked over to the sidelines like are you coming in to get me he s a heck no that s the first first like that in two hours and there s <person player="johnny knox" race="nonwhite" position="WR">johnny knox</person> who very fuel said he thought was the number one pears where s the snap count nobody s even heard offense fiveyard penalty first out kevin schafer 26 yard pass play and then the false start here and make it first down in 15 and you know that it s sort of the frightening part about this for bears fans obviously you want first and foremost to be concerned about the health of <person player="jay cutler" race="white" position="QB">jay cutler</person> but with the concussion concerns in the nfl now will he be able to play next week week after it s hard to know this morning of course we were talking about the bears come in they want to show theyre as good as their record and now all of a sudden youve got some questions tonight where the everybody s got to go wait a minute what what happened to this offense what s going on here what are we doing yeah especially you know when they you consider that they just got finished playing green bay and dallas two of the very best defenses in football and they beat dallas down there and made dallas defense look a little vulnerable which they very rarely do and then to come back up here against the giants defense it looked better last week but you wouldnt have said with some of the injuries were you know topical a yes second is 15 a short game is that was fun and do a lot of traffic and then ill make it to third and long but you think about perry fuel in the job that he s done now for the new york giants and we talked about a little bit earlier but mike march you anticipated okay it s going to take him a little while to grow into this offense and here s a guy that is the head coach of the buffalo bills for a while thought he might have gotten the job the following year as well didnt and for the new york giants with all the problems they had defensively a season ago to get this kind of turn and that s exciting as well that s <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin</person> tough with the sack and for perry fuel and his defense and the story we havent touched tonight is that fuel could have been the defensive coordinator of either of these teams lovey <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> talked to him about coming to chicago last year well he s that good there s <person player="justin tuck" race="nonwhite" position="DE">justin tuck</person> and this isnt like an immediate protections not too bad but bears quarterbacks need to get a clock out there in the practice field that goes to about 25 seconds and if you dont throw it before the buzzer goes off just anticipate ahead i have to go for it on fourth that pants is completed barely matters because theyre going to turn the ball over on downs to <person player="earl bennett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">earl bennett</person> and the giants will take over on downs near midfield now there were a lot of great defensive players honored out here tonight at halftime and they have to be proud of what theyve seen that the way the giants ran the football tonight the way they took over the game with physical play on their defense this was the kind of game that tom coughlin was hoping for this is what you think about when you think about giants football hoping for and really needed because that s new york and you know what happen the little watch three in a row theyre going on the road next week theyre going to houston they come back to play detroit then they go on the road for two more to dallas and if seattle and <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">bradshaw</person> up get stopped it stuck those how many sacks holds up both hands he said yeah we got ten that s right it was really something and id say it has been not just the front end the back end has done the job tonight as well that the additions of <person player="antrel rolle" race="nonwhite" position="DB">antrel rolle</person> and <person player="deon grant" race="nonwhite" position="DB">deon</person> grin and <person player="kenny phillips" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kenny phillips</person> coming back at the safety position they have really improved this roster i think that the play of those safeties has made the biggest difference in my mind go to the twominute warning the giants 17 the bears three you bob tony and mike florio wrap up the game well look ahead to eagles 49ers you know one thing about lovie <person player="steve smith" race="nonwhite" position="WR">smith</person> like most head coaches he s very competitive he s also a realist he s in the situation he could have taken all of his timeouts it s a two possession game he had the to mount warning as well he chose not to take him on the other side of the break he was out of quarterback he s out of quarterbacks he s out of offense and in effect they get two chances not enough yeah <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person> around the corner run out by danielle manning yeah this is an offensive line that maybe wasnt quite as good early on but they did come on here late <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear pascoe</person> from the fullback position has played a really nice game on that long run by <person player="ahmad bradshaw" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ahmad bradshaw</person> he had the key block on that one as well and <person player="madison hedgecock" race="white" position="RB">madison</person> hitchcock has especially the first game of the year wasnt so good this may become a bit of an answer maybe <person player="bear pascoe" race="white" position="TE">bear pascoe</person> comes in it makes it a little better jacob watch the port at the end of the play gets back on it on the fiveyard line with a minute and a half and love he s just gonna let the clock wind down itll be first down and goal getting a little slick with the running game now watch <person player="kevin boss" race="white" position="TE">kevin boss</person> come over here and kick out <person player="julius peppers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">julius peppers</person> and <person player="brandon jacobs" race="nonwhite" position="RB">brandon jacobs</person> stayed right on the hole so even defensively now theyve finally given it up their offense gave them nothing to even hope for tonight and you know poplin knows that love he s not calling time the gays with all the timeouts and the giants gonna take take a knee right now he says hey look you know i respect what youre doing and im not gonna pour it on right now some of the crowd moves i dont know why because everything that they might have had in mind has already been taken care of it was a tremendously with the new york crowd boos in the situation like this it always has something to do with you know what but tonight it really doesnt wanting to win the game that s exactly right giants football tonight though yep and for the bears still three in one still atop the division but it feels a little different right now doesnt it and the giants go to 2 &amp; 2 which is the same record of the philadelphia eagles the washington redskins dallas one and two with a bye fantastic defensive performance tonight by the jets 17 3 new york over chicago with the gillette postgame report coming right up but first these messages from your local nbc station
