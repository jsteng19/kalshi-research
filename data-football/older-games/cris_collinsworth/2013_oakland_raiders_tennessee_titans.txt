explosive plays the first half so far from either team kind of quiet day for the quarterback the ugly interception from the glowing sun out of his own end zone need a team really been able to run the ball effectively between a lot of eightman fronts from both defenses and where s that one big reception the kindle right so impressed johnson eight carries on <person player="usama young"

jumping sorry this unloaded <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> right delta patrick works across the 35 has the time in tungsten second year man from smu who go six six about 270 pounds there was a combination of rachel moore were able to come down and fit statute really loves this moto approach barbra nation a lot more difficult for defensive coordinator jason harvard dialogue very aggressive and also makes after goes the other way through another really convincing first down <person player="kevin burnett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kevin burnett</person> we saw linebacker on the tackle that s good for full team and you can see how the titans are picking up the pace first on smithfield big very bad for me in this back again is tied at six now johnson returns to the backfield playaction the patrick in trouble with patrick would have good job looks like he was brought back behind the line pressure from <person player="kevin burnett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kevin burnett</person> and lamar huston well theyre going to bring <person player="kevin burnett" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kevin

position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> does the next best thing he just scrambled not quite the runner that <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">jake</person> walker is actually lost the yard second and 11 could have been much worse the fact is we season out of harvard he first harvard graduate to start an nfl game at quarterback and out calls for time first time out taken in this first half you look at mike munchak the head coaches it tightens and reminder coming up on the horizon halftime report it s jb dan shannon gober coach bill cowher have all the latest jenna how scores and highlights coming up on these horizon halftime report im going to give darrel log and bar of the offensive coordinator to the senate detained a lot of credit you have to be able to adjust your scheme to fit the players you have especially a quarterback and couldnt make that adjustment there early the lockers equipment from back the 50 would have in reserve or concept that this patrick is comfortable with second an 11 to practice bus with not five anymore again is flying and walford on the coverup attachment <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> goes for five holding number 67 often an arbitrary heavily 1500 and ii will be three left guard that is the fifth penalty on tennessee a really sloppy performance my beaches right in the middle your screen there and he is in good position right now right there is where he get afraid as he s trying to spin out in the middle of your screen the bc has been a great ad coming over and free agency from the buffalo bill to say the frustration there for mike munchak it is a second and 21 really you know sucker but through the hands of <person player="kenny britt" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kenny</person> he has been a forgotten man well big reason he has been forgotten marv is giving the drop and this is not an easy catch of a low fastball inside and he was satisfied the way to make those plays apply follow down the jeff the depth chart inconsistency drop at the block well the further a cyber spin or polarize people saw he was actually asking for three prior for the red line his contract over after this season with mustard forcing them out of the funk on has no letter joe and ill flags come fly three flags on the field instead of pushing and shoving between like <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> lake jenkins were having each other s face mask it all took place right in front after the play for sense is very roughness number 15 defense correction number 15 offense yard will be added for be able to play fourth down it s called on <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> on receiver and the heightens and they usually get the player that retaliates it s not the player that initiated the pushing of the shelving you can see in being disciplined on the sidelines gotta use good judgment you have to be able to walk away once in a while rip that s eight penalty for 86 yards against you tennessee theyre right on the middle of the pack in terms of most penalties while open is number five in the week they could hit the holy for 450 yards so the cunning of it is in the pokey forward is his back at his 41 for the laters there s hacks taken at the 21yard my that s a 50 b to r plus my current so im tom year 20 really long and the radar offensive unit talking earlier about the conversation with bill obrien was his head coach at penn state and in the aftermath of the jerry sandusky scandal mccoy led the nittany lions to a record of eight and four under obrien actually hope keeps had football program alive what is a very critical condition there s mccoy his padded out you mentioned the listed height of <person player="matt mcgloin" race="white" position="QB">mcgloin</person> six one does that hurt him in the long run of course weve seen shorter quarterbacks certainly not successful the middle you see him get that ball the throwing position i mean youre going to see those defenders try and get their hands up it s already the third batted ball weve seen today so who gets the tip there again got to be able to slide and theyll adjust your arm motion by pockets rush jenny s running hard that s costly 25 do you think he is 6 1 6 1 but he s not a very physically imposing player i mean you look at him there he s a guy that you know obviously gets stronger i think you know he s the <person player="usama young" race="nonwhite" position="DB">young</person> player yeah that experience is a little bit quarterback but i think you feel then desperation compositions important to get in the weight room get strong and do more throwing but their entry let s put it that way or they dont maybe know that this guy s a <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> a knop quarterback a very tree and they can very well the rest of the way you might find yourself a home here in oakland it s a third down and seven put a first down open up by <person player="george wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">george wilson</person> eightyard gain from annoying summative warning here at oakland pilots inks are rich raiders out there 33 two minutes left here in the first half if you are <person player="matt mcgloin" race="white" position="QB">matt mcgloin</person> which the raiders would not mind it seven how do you how do you play from here well weve got to start having some success on the early downs and it s jovenel just 80 yards of offense i havent been able to throw the ball for the wide receivers of all faith pull back give me holly secondyear player from all texas state goes for 26 yards this is what they need a little bit of play action and get to pull back out of stage below wally tennessee is actually played very well defensively dimension just 80 yards of offense service to the raiders level to a pair of field goals more numbers ugly six 414 setting one article interception what a fourth catch of the season for all of wally on a first down coming up at the tennessee 41 but a timeout is taken by the raiders their first time out of this first half so both tennessee and oakland with two timeouts remaining these two teams come in at four and six and as you look at the afc playoff picture which is bizarre in this week number 12 the division leaders are aware identity new england cincinnati kansas city and at the moment pittsburgh in a wildcard spot everybody else in behind 14 of 16 teams are in the hunt for a playoff berth earlier pittsburgh over cleveland yellow lose to the rebound usually carolina compiled a mas de penny out of the first down so theyre moving the ball effectively here in these final minutes of the first half moses koku able to get to <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> so theyre shipped <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> out and nobody comes out to cover them until it s too late i mean it s a confusion there who wait to get out to cover jenny blue an assignment there defensively raiders goes down at the va god my little bit 18 yards he goes the 15 well a lot of misdirection with the running game to the oakland raiders theyre not going to be able to just win the <person player="jackie battle" race="nonwhite" position="RB">battle</person> the trenches each week and just beat you up in the running game so they have to be able to create some space with misdirection and that s just what this is from <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashad jennings</person> raiders first on a team tennessee 14 yard line very free to go man the first half table drive of a hand he s picked it up in the second quarter in poker on the package <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> picks up five whore and they are not afraid to repeat plays we saw <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> run over the left side of this offensive line they come right back to at this time instead of bouncing it to the edge he works back up inside and that little crease right there between the tackle an end once again left he came to an offensive line and ill get in trouble he is i can tight in position getting fired on the back wheel what of the first round he goes to three and the raiders take their second time out of this first half so they have one remaining that stops the clock with 56 seconds to go in the half neither team has been very productive down on this part of the field both teams having to settle for field goals critical third third and three here on the six for dennis allen and <person player="greg jenkins" race="UNK" position="WR">greg</person> olson the offensive coordinator i thought it was interesting marv looking at the quarterback today <person player="terrelle pryor" race="nonwhite" position="WR">terrelle pryor</person> hasnt been a guy that really has worn a wristband and if you look at matt mccoy he s wearing a wrist band has just about every play on it you see it right on that left hip left arm about forearm of his plays you come in if you need to do to the reference youre very very balanced like a little bit of a cheat sheet without a place for about a hundred places in half he s mixed in why looking to shine and to make a deepfried im gonna get it s not down that s the piece attempted by mergejoin that has been added how much would be saving hell the defensive tackle look sammy hell get the right hand in on it and you know when these things keep happening youve got to change your launch point youve got to be able to slide you got to be able to find holes just cant sit back there oblivious to the rush and try and fit one in fourth and three from the six so here is <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian janikowski</person> a hit from 52 and line driver just made it for 40 those recap to believe not with just 48 second ago in the first half this week dont miss the show that s italy by itself you guys you take out all 32 teams and each other every week paint <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brown</person> will sense cris collinsworth with the artistry of nfl fields inside the nfl that showed it the pros watch wednesday at not only on showtime they actually look confused but kind of walking around the set smiling with each other a lot of confusion on a set well that s the fulton show they entered operating procedure im told a good look right there yall put the coordinated dialogue it s talking to brian <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> going through the scenario here with a couple timeouts left in 48 seconds imabelle logging s looks like he s just out of junior high school 33 years old got that point to get a voice look yep first full year as a nfl for data sixth season in the league even the quarterbacks coach so 48 seconds remaining in this moose 10 have been widely back for the fish it bounces out of the end zone the point it to the point where weve been a number of bad evolve today for miss tennessee defensive line to do a good job getting up feeling and getting their hands up if you cant get there youve got to be able to do it quarterback by the lowest point and put that right or left hand up and the titans have done a terrific job of is theyre going to have to the wings going to have to make an adjustment at halftime with matt mcgorry we talked about a tie to just six foot one at the defensive line of the peyten has been a terrific job forcing him to the finish the tight window not allowed him to the ball the other line of scrimmage fantasy verse have two timeouts remaining examine after forcing <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> to run and takes it out of bounds to stop the clock picked up a yard <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> starting for the injured drake lot with his start of you here from field goal territory but you know that <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> is certainly thinking about it he s got plenty of leg didnt need a couple big completions though and <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> had to be able to set his feet he s got a good job force involved a spot or something to floss until his left now with time turnovers bounce catch clock is running or a throw a comeback and we dont see a ton of this from <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> he loves to throw the ball between the numbers the pose outside the number sometimes they dont believe he trusted our strength but has a very good throw great anticipation by <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> original tightened he take their final timeout apparently no they have one left it was a second timeout hill that effectively stopped the clock in 34 seconds remaining the first down at the tennessee 35 yard line patrick run to edit crack let us see a team that is had a number of dropped passes throughout the season <person player="delanie walker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">delanie walker</person> the tight end not able to hang on no they got what they wanted to any walkers it s going to sit down in the zone but rate is the ball is coming go ahead and run it right there he just takes a quick peek you got to be able to squeeze it weve seen a couple drops today where the receiver takes his eye off the ball and you anxious to look behind them down from the 35 a half minute remaining half the packet gets it away the first time to some a diving catch by walkers and now the titans use their final timeout where they love those crossing routes theyre going to run a ton of them today against all the mantoman coverage theyre going to see from this raiders secondary fantasy five losses their last six games they started the season at 3 and 1 they lost two straight at home to jacksonville and indianapolis preceded by a winner at st louis and it s just the first of three straight games on the road is a tough schedule today here if the raiders and indianapolis and at denver not an easy stretch we get a first down here at a football field here theyve got it inbound theyve got to be able to pocket get him to a facility pull hitter struck another opportunity for <person player="kenny britt" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kenny britt</person> that s the third drop pass by the titans second by blood and this guy has not planned a lot of conference bini employed what a waste of town on me a big strong receiver just cant squeeze it and again as long as you see the inconsistency for a moment if you drop the ball and youll lose your job he was the starter beginning of season and then he was moved back to the third receiver now he s back at the fourth receiver behind the <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> and <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall wright</person> <person player="nate washington" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate washington</person> the god has ruled in all his confidence firstround pick 2009 45 catches the first law let s see who can put the football well <person player="george wilson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">george wilson</person> apparently was able to cover off but they lose it on downs well they had a low slow snap and then it looked like <person player="jeremy stewart" race="UNK" position="RB">jeremy stewart</person> got in there and got a hand on it huge block only 11 seconds remaining and the half of the raiders have it down at the tennessee 37 yard line <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> in the backfield what are you one timeout remaining for oakland freedom and ill go from calls with time before seconds preventing the half time to get <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian janikowski</person> back on the field a really nice throw by with lloyd the streeter streeters running the quarter lau then he just sits it down in the hole between the safety in the corner and <person player="matt mcgloin" race="white" position="QB">mcgloin</person> calls a time out almost immediately 23 yard game the ball is just inside the 15 <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> will attempt from 32 he s hit from 50 to 48 and 24 buhbuhbuh it is waived off no good ravens thought they had it is an overlooking the lawyer good snap in a good hold and <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> just bushes in wool left and that s not i mean this guy has been so good for miss die forty see the frustration from back on foot line so that is the end of the first half graders nine titans six back of the horizon halftime after this and a word from your local station welcome back to the open policy you turtle day in the bay area and the raiders the benign six leave on the titans let s take a look at the first half performance presented by intel well it was early second quarter exact route of tennessee picking off the rookie matt lemoine and their this interception led to the 22 yard field goal by <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> to give tennessee a 6 to 3 lead however <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian janikowski</person> came back for the raiders to kick two field goals and that gave the raiders believe ovo <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> missed on a very close attempt right in the final seconds but it s been a defensive gear game not much offense to this point now ugly offensively really look the titans <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> just 25 rushing yards on 9 carries theyve got to be able to get him going and the raiders have the same issues offensive line either team s been good on third down neither team has been good in the red zone what s your feel from a glowing about first half he had four passes batted down well he s got up youve got to get that corrected and how do you if youre 6 foot 1 how do you get that corrected tomorrow in a game with big men big men in front of big men rushing in front of him you know it s a smaller quarterback i was only 6 3 i had my helmet issues you got to be able to slide around youve got to be able to find hold in the rush youve got to know where your quick answer throws are particularly when youre throwing the crossing route and the route to the flat and that s where most of it balls have been batted you say youre only 6 3 youve been telling us youre 6 5 have you i got those lifters in my shoe now <person player="devon wylie" race="UNK" position="WR">devon</person> why were you able to pick up postimperial situation that went through the legs of my <person player="ryan robinson" race="UNK" position="DE">robinson</person> you know the titans wind usually <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> has something to do with it and you know you look at quarterback comparison to the first half of look long not great numbers from from either quarterback although <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> completing 2/3 of his throat but theyve got to get the ball to first job look at the key to it all johnson is in command here has this first quarter gets underway there for play fake only shoes and it is caught nice catch by kindle right to a stock line you can play she quoted rich we were talking about gentle right with <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> yesterday i said you know right as a safety blanket for being kind of a a stevie johnson type maybe he has exceptional looking ball in his hands and he has a handful for any quarterback keep them up to him to run first round of the 38 car drivers johnson at palomar dish from the right defensive end so johnson picks up five but he has been held in check he s a guy who can explode as we have seen on many an occasion but to this point has not you look at in just 63 yards a game rush and only one game over 100 all things he is dangerous but the raiders have done a good job compared to him and not giving him a freaking fe for johnson and <person player="collin mooney" race="UNK" position="RB">mooney</person> in the backfield stutter step move his hold up to the 45 yard line is kevin burrtec getting the rats on it on johnson picked up to the glory days look from overhead at the coliseum and an oakland affectionately known as the black hole i call it a hostile environment huh it can be and again this is was oh is it self place to play because the crowd is really right on top of you and that black hole book can be really tough if youre the opponent very light out <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin</person> tennessee a single round in branson coming up of the stover touched out of the season well what a great move

position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> get the rest 54yard touchdown play one of seven receivers that <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> has been able to connect with this afternoon as tennessee has taken the lead good job of return of autism toss a sari on line 23 yards returned while aerial coverage of today s game is being provided by metlife marv albert with rich gannon tennessee with a 39 lead on oakland the winner today will go to a record of five and six and that would put them in this week grown into number six five it being a playoff berth but the season is not in to the exerciser nelson to offer play hope asc conferences is really up in the air tomorrow need to talk about those that s succeed and against six four and six teams coming into today s game two five and five teams and it s a a lot of mediocre football teams right now somebody is going to emerge from the pack and it may be one of these two teams the titans

i have of the raiders that i dont date through a good enough job getting him the ball not just in terms of the running game but the pass again you mentioned a probe over a year ago he can do it all from the backfield if the fine it s a priority and im able to point during the week im not saying that rhys would be more of a factor here today passes clear this time for another oakland first down rod streeter secondyear player out of temple goes prefer jeane alquran brother on the stuff well burner gets caught with his back turned look he got the screen i mean it s just way too much separation there they run little comeback route well going gets it out quick so one thing about matt but going that we know is that he makes up his mind quickly he s very accurate not a lot of indecision in his game pretty good velocity on this pass he s now had a fine to 147 yard jenny once you get a short pickup were shot <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> who

the rest of the way theyre really surprised it was fourth defensive back from the <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> texans jason was out jenny wanted to put him down from behind then he anticipate for a bigger bag first down at the tennessee 44th he drop off her first i thought it was very cold floyd likes home she s a bit of a thumbing through our

race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> trying to find food oh right the tractor was that a gamewinning drive against the rate of the pores with the pills early 2011 team down by four late in the fourth of a feeding yard touchdown drive is capped off by that six yard touchdown pass but david nelson and buffalo wanted in a thriller 38 to 45 can he pull it off once again the backfield johnson makes return as the first out as it dies forward it s a buck from philip <person player="phillip adams" race="UNK" position="DB">adams</person> playing for the injured mike champions i think the addition of sean <person player="shonn greene" race="nonwhite" position="RB">greene</person> has helped chris job just watch <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> finished runs and i mean lower that head he saw a great finish from him against the colts on thursday night and that guy right there shot green i think it helps <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> become a more physical runner a much better job at the end of run johnson 18 carries 70 yards first and chanting open booty for stomping on trial you would see gain of two on the play <person player="charles woodson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles woodson</person> still a special player second on the team with 80 tackles he still makes a ton of plays and you have to be careful with him in a pocket you know in the ball around other defenders this guy is the best efficient ripping around once we are drunk super duper takes to handle always push back grants walker was right out of vans walkers moved over to defensive end for the injured jason hunting out of an equal cut realignment i think that right now more this is almost full timeout but your parent is no man s land right here get over here the lasers close out of a sudden i caught my <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> and has a first out and he almost pulled away picked up eight so <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin</person> hunted with his fifth catch four hundred yards including a touchdown and that s who they wanted to go after check one remember now he is in for the injured night <person player="jake locker" race="white" position="QB">jake</person> and theyve done a good job throwing the ball his area he said of downs here for the titans as we come up on two minutes to play in the fourth quarter what we reserved tennessee first out of the oakland hoody three three point lead over agency provider tonight on 60 minutes rightyho through his public enemy number one on the run for 16 years so how did the fbi five and well find out yourself only on 60 minutes all right tennessee three times remote enforcement time the little food with chris bosh s foot goes and he has to stop the clock right at the marker brought out by and silly <person player="usama young" race="nonwhite" position="DB">young</person> boy kindle right has real quickness to him he just catches a little under out no one could kill him on the ground but he has been a real playmaker to the tennessee titan right able to step out to stop the clock and put off the first down at the 23yard on it literally sitting on johnson answer to stop havent taken down by ceo more the strong side linebacker just a yard pickup as <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> continues to take walks along that sideline he may have to come on looking tired i remember now fancy is that three trips down here in the red zone it not be able to come away from touchdowns you want to be able to finish down he dont have settle for a field goal and roll the dice in overtime every way of the drive he swatted at 4:25 a reader 22 jackson puts a move on good tackle at the 20yard line is johnson product phone away phil <person player="phillip adams" race="UNK" position="DB">adams</person> fouryear man from south carolina state who has come on because of several injuries in that secondary i talked about a critical situation again now third and six it is making substitutions bringing more defensive backs on the field to match up bell rock if you got a doubt the best one here hope it has enough time to make a good accurate throw stop the 46 second as tennessee loses its first time out of this second half the both teams have two timeouts with aiden coming up time committing after the game of subway post game during gvj and shannon booboo and coach bill cowher but all the latest nfl schools and highlights coming up on the subways postgame show and as you mentioned earlier the winner of this game today mathematically anthesis week 12 takes over the number six and final playoff berth in the afc with fourteen of the sixteen afc teams still eligible to make the playoffs we go back a good 5 out morale rather than russia free and was a firm support by <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> and appeal critical timeout really maybe they dropped eight and <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> is able to fit this one in to <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> between the safety <person player="charles woodson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">charles woodson</person> an underneath the underneath the fender look how tight that window was there he had it he actually had to throw it behind them so it didnt get deflected the good anticipation there by <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> and tennessee took the time out they have one left so they pick up the first down apple well the raiders had a big stop here last week in the rezo against the against <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> can they do it again seven regulation fires everyone covered equivalent smart play by <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> a couple more shots with 22 seconds left the ball at the open ten second down and goal the louis routing it away 22 seconds left in a timeout you wont necessarily have to throw it in the end zone and throw it underneath unless some will try and run it let s patrick <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> motors are written up closer okay wait antennae put <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> who had it for an issue well this was really close mrs <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> starts scrambling to his left right before he goes down he s able to flick this out would have been a terrific catch for <person player="chris johnson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">chris johnson</person> was trying to keep his feet involved and look like i was the just the runner was open but cant only see that when youre <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> scrambling to us philip <person player="phillip adams" race="UNK" position="DB">adams</person> on the trouble of johnson here we go for it in gold 15 seconds many more regulations with patrick looking he throws a full of a thought touchdown check for white now <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall</person> right just a relative stick rowdy for some reason <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> is way off look at the reaction from mike munchak he knows with a steak look look at dialogue and big time thrived there by the tennessee titan that is huge throw from <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> and only ten seconds remaining they will reveal another part every touchdown is reviewed you talk about the importance of depth to the quarterback position and this gets this case the veteran <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> outplayed the rookie matt mccoy but just a terrific job their question is did he break the plane that s what theyre looking at he s going down or he gets touched i think clearly that balls across the line actually let me correct myself every touchdown every score is reviewed without the coaches challenge look at the reaction from <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> and <person player="justin hunter" race="nonwhite" position="WR">justin hunter</person> he had to do the right thing he had a release outside and make sure that he took philip <person player="phillip adams" race="UNK" position="DB">adams</person> with them little surprised that the veteran <person player="tracy porter" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tracy porter</person> didnt jump that route when he initially saw <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall wright</person> breakout now with 10 seconds left mccoy is going to need some help you can eat a big return you get the ball out around midfield and take a couple shot big return that does not take i dont really it s tough after review the ruling on the field is confirmed touchdown although his knee is down he was not down by contact he went into the end zone therefore it is a touchdown so <person player="kendall wright" race="nonwhite" position="WR">kendall</person> white with six more catches has 65 for the season titans leaving receiver and im a <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">fitzpatrick</person> 8 4 10 6 &amp; 7 yards on the drive about hunter and right stick hope in six gadgets both over a hundred yards remain both had a score guys have come three protecting on hosting point a robust to make a 2319 tonight on cbs 60 minutes followed by the episodes of the amazing race the good fight and the novelist that s all coming up tonight on cbs so 10 seconds remaining and obviously under normal conditions you want strong return but you cannot take too much time well you know if youre the titans you got society of cattle <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">rob bironas</person> just bang this thing out of the back of the endzone if not the navy you squib it you just dont want to allow the raiders you look at robbie april theyre in the middle of that pile the special teams coordinator for the oakland raiders just dont want to give an opportunity to return one go back first think about what could have happened in a game of course these two missed field goals by <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">sebastian</person> jenna calkins today both to the left both well within his range they were costly today the raiders this was from 32 and then from 48 and talking about one of the most accurate longrange kickers he had hit his previous three including a 52yard er and after the two misses he did connect from 42 of tennessee with a 2319 we would see how <person player="rob bironas" race="white" position="K">bironas</person> does play you wouldnt have to give <person player="taiwan jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taiwan</person> <person player="taiwan jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taiwan</person> gel to return that s it on the <person player="zach brown" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brown</person> is covered up immediately at the 30yard line by <person player="jeremy stewart" race="UNK" position="RB">jeremy stewart</person> suggest one second off the clock raiders who have two timeouts remaining if tennessee holds on they go to five and six they move into that number six spot for the playoffs with what was going on earlier today well with nine seconds left and a couple of timeouts youre going to have a chance for two plays youve got to be able to complete the ball in the middle of the field here or to the boundary try and get it up around the 50 yard line and then you can take a shot there the end zone but youve got to be able to pick up 820 right here our mark intended only only greater insight nick kissin a pack of tiny now that now theyve got one shot theyve got to throw a ball up and hopefully someone can get up get up and make a tip and somebody can get behind the defender but you can look how deep theyre going to be in this tennessee secondary probably russ three and drop eight and coverage look how deep they are off the screen just four seconds left and it s a short range tomorrow ball is loose at will laugh at tennessee in fact comes up put the football and a disappointed crowd here in oakland is darrell casey who ends up on on top of the ball and <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> from a terrific performance as we take a look at the bizarre scenario and the afc tennessee now in the number six spot at the moment this is only we 12 they go to five and six they had dropped five of their previous six they now have won 12 of the last 13 here in oakland raiders drop to four and seven not mathematically output would need a miracle finish so the titans come from a high they won a 2319 tonight on cbs 60 headed by new episodes of the amazing race too good wife and the minimus so for rich gannon part of is saying so long from oakland california
