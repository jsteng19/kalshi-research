today with erin andrews jo after their shutout to indianapolis <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus</person> warren s came out and said well we were feeling pretty good about ourselves due to that winning streak but now it s time to get back to basics and that s what they did this week as a defense their coordinator rod marinelli saying in that game he didnt feel they were as physical as they needed to be missed quite a few tackles but he said the biggest thing he told them the same group of guys that had that win streak but now it s time to wake up well let s see how they do against the buccaneers first play after a 37 yard kick return is a pass that s complete the <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> and then he gets popped a gain of five <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> one of those two very good young linebackers there to make the stop for dallas and it s second down and five there s <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> 14 touchdowns that s the good he s making his eighth start 13 interceptions that s the bat second and five rick for all humphreys has a first down a couple of catches by number 10 layton van dhiresh out there after an eight yard game to make the stop and it looks like <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> is down on his back and he will get attention when we come back well dig deeper into this tampa bay offense as they check on <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> early fox do they give a sponsored by the ford f150 it doesnt just raise the bard who leaves the bar well the second play from scrimmage and <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> is being put on that backboard and is going to be carted off the field there he is at right defensive end it was kind of hard to tell from from that exactly what happened but obviously theyve been paying a lot of tension to him theyve brought the card out now here s a better look if you see <person player="ryan jensen" race="white" position="OT">ryan jensen</person> go into him with that helmet slash left part of his shoulder pad and so it was a hit up to the head or neck area for <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> and you can see the concern on the faces of his teammates both sides just standing watching hoping and im sure many praying that is okay take another break as they continue to be careful with <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> sapp today s dealer sponsored by metro by tmobile get unlimited highspeed data all month long alma mattie mobile network when steamed dr drew dossett or the dallas cowboys checking the strength in the hands of <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> the the really good sign was that <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">crawford</person> has been obviously there squeezing the right hand of drew able to move his arms but obviously anytime you have a hit up in the head neck area and the player is in that much distress theyre going to use the utmost caution to make sure that they stabilize him immobilize him and get him off the field and get him looked at and you see the concern faces with his dallas cowboy teammates made such <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> saw the look on the face a moment ago by <person player="ryan jensen" race="white" position="OT">ryan jensen</person> who was the one that came down and blocked him the fifth year and i felt pro center for the tampa bay buccaneers and a little wave to the crowd and any update we get on the condition of <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> we will certainly pass along and a thumbs up on his way out and play continues after that sobering moment first down for tampa bay at their own 49 third play from scrimmage <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> looking for admins what a throw in a catch and <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> makes the grab and a big play on the third play for the buccaneers <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> in coverage in a completion of 38 yards three straight completions to start this game he s got <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> and he s working against <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> the pro bowl corner and just flatout runs behind now there was a little bit of a push off it looked like right there by evans which created a little bit of that separation but he s he s one of the big play threats along with <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> and this is a quarterback in <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> who will take his shots from the 13 <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> flag is thrown the pass is thrown away and it looked like a whole holding offense number 77 at the 10yard penalty replay first down a couple of notes about that completion of <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> evans comes into this game 95 yards shy of a new buccaneers singleseason record for receiving yards he s already number one and tampa bay franchise history he s only in his fifth year the seventh overall pick in 2014 not a pro bowler this year many consider it a snub number two this season and receiving yards and over 1300 come in and off his <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> well aware of games and what it takes to beat the cowboys after his time in philadelphia and washington leighton van der ash on the stop after a four yard gain and you see the numbers where they rank in the important categories and here s an offensive line that s been really healthy all season long for the most part yeah they really have the only guy who s missed the start is their right tackle damore <person player="demar dotson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">dotson</person> and that s unusual weve seen a lot of these teams around the league and you dont find many that have been as healthy as theyve been second down and 16 camryn great thatll bring up third down and sixteen and we saw all that went on with <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> aaron were you able to get any information yeah dallas telling us right away that obviously he has been transported to a local hospital theyre calling it an xtreme and that obviously he s out with the thumbs up a good sign and now a third down in 16 the big play on this drive to 38 yarder to <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> working against first time pro bowl corner <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> on third down pass is over the middle broken up <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> is there in front of <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">adam humphries</person> and that will bring up 4th down and bring on the field goal unit for the bucks the job there by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> he sits down right at the first down line and his <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> unable then to work back through to the ball you know questionable whether or not there was contact at the top of the route but <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> everyone has talked about the year that he has had i thought he struggled as he came into the year early but boy he has really improved as a year has gone along made a lot of place for this defense here s kyra <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> from 37 yards anything but a given for tampa bay and he knocks it through buccaneers take the opening kickoff big play the 38 yarder to <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> the defense holds on a big third down three nothing tampa bay so coverage brought to you by state farm after the dallas cowboys for just the third time this year allow an opponent to score on their opening drive that s now 24 total points so far allowed in the first quarter by the dallas defense that s how dominant theyve been that s by far the lowest total in the nfl as <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> who was just activated from the practice squad takes a knee in the end zone out to the 25 and here s <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> who a didnt run the ball one time at indianapolis last week and b is being criticized for holding the ball too long a big reason why he has suffered 51 sacks he s coming off a game that was one of his least productive in the at least productive days offensively for the cowboys but there was a lot of opportunity in that game they just failed to take advantage of the passing game were going to see a lot of this <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> right up the gut for 11 and the tampa bay defense that allowed 240 to <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> yards last week at baltimore is going to be tested by this run game fourth ranked in the nfl for the dallas cowboys well it sure helps that they got their allpro right guard <person player="zack martin" race="white" position="OT">zack martin</person> back in the lineup this week he missed his first game of his career last week and that loss to indianapolis he was missed and then xavier will feel oh he comes back in at left guard setting up the screen for elliot and that s well played and that is the terrific linebacker levante david the numbers are sensational for number 54 a secondround pick out of nebraska coming off a big two sack game against the ravens a week ago they had this set up pretty good you guys got two blockers out there to take on levante david he he splits the two and is able to make the play on zeke elliott diggs been very involved here the last three weeks in the passing game a lot of those this replay there s big was right into the gut of a darius <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> wow know where that was headed but might have been headed back the other way as you look at the nfl ranks for this bucks defense 28th overall and they are not good against the run and for the most part not that good against the pass either know that it s not very good okay good summary but a darius <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> i mean that ball hit him right in the stomach and i dont know if your deck and youre trying to throw that ball on the slant route how you dont see that one guys <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> protected throw better catch he got both feet down and a first down a completion of 31 right foot and left foot inbounds what a play a really good play and actually good throw there in a too deep coverage here and that s the one area where you can beat the safety with the ball he just got to get his feet down the left foot was one that was close but youre right you see green to the stripe there s that almost interception by a darius <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> it s easy <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> it s easy to say that ball was thrown hard right into his back but still an odd throw by <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> prior to that big one to <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> gallagher as our former partner cris collinsworth loosening the traction defense number 94 massive for a three five yards yes please i cant wait together you know what im going to say said that that ball had a little humming baby on it this is the earliest youve ever thrown a college were not even five minutes into the first quarter first down in five 31yard completion on third down and 12 facemask there is no flag that helmet was turned but evidently it was up top betta fea was the one that got that big right hand on the helmet no facemask a gain of five in a first down for dallas i might have looked even like <person player="joe looney" race="nonwhite" position="OG">joe looney</person> may have even gotten away with a little bit of a hold on <person player="vita vea" race="nonwhite" position="DT">vita</person> baya who obviously their 12th overall pick in the first round and this this year s draft missed some time early in the season missed preseason but he is coming off his best game of the season last sunday against the raiders his way through this defense and flag flies as you can see out of the secondary see who this is against this is a cowboys team that has had a lot of penalties especially here in the last three weeks it s a big reason why they havent been able to score more points illegal block in the back offense number 17 to 10yard penalty replay first down it s <person player="allen hurns" race="nonwhite" position="WR">allen hurns</person> number 17 that s who they got for the block in the back joe going and looking at these penalties on the cowboys in the last three weeks theyve had 28 penalties for 264 yards and you know they get these drives going much like this one here and theyve just not been in offense that s been capable of overcoming these long down situations and here they are now with first and 20 wipes away a 7 yard run here s what underneath too has to get it that is steam going and <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> 225 the offensive numbers for the tampa bay buccaneers are terrific and we see their scrimmage touchdowns at the bottom and compare that however to the defensive numbers and the touchdowns that they have surrendered the most across the league and dirt cutter in his third season and a lot of chatter out there that he could be winding down his time the head coach of the tampa bay buccaneers second down in 10 getsome as a first down <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">adams</person> with the tackle a gain of 10 and in two plays they overcome that first in 20 after the block in the back well this is wellexecuted you got <person player="blake jarwin" race="white" position="TE">blake</person> jar went along with tyrants smith you see the blocking and then cooper just able to help out those blocks and get back to the inside so yeah first and 20 they picked up 10 with <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> come right back to cooper and now theyve got a new set it down wescott take another sack and that s fááá and a flag comes in at the end of it this is they looked they may have gotten sue a filo on a hold im not certain what the flag is well get a call but about a face mask on faith wow they get the they get the face mask on him which youre right based on where that flag came in at personal foul face mask and defends hundred fifty that penalty shot the dishes for the both in the previous five first down see be innovative right here and there looks like you might have been able to get a hold on sua vila but they get him with the face mask and and that s that s just an area even though they now are moving the ball closer there s marked under the defensive coordinator took over midseason but the face mask eliminates what would have been a sack but this has been pretty repetitive over the weeks with that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> down here holding the ball too long and really affecting them not being able to score here s <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> keeping for the touchdown he didnt run last week in india we didnt waste any time today at home against tampa bay rushing touchdown number six on the year four number four <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael gallup</person> he s the one who s going to get the big block you can see him come in from the right of the screen right there on the safety andrews or <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> which springs <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> this game is going to come down to who s able to come away with touchdowns down there the buck sets up the cowboys get seven and that s a change for dallas how about the 31 yard completion on third and 12 to help set it up to <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael gallup</person> dont forget about that and then <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> takes it in dallas with the early lead trying to win the division here today your tickets today dallas cowboys coming off their first shutout in 15 years they want to put that indianapolis colts game behind him as fast as they can he wanted the design runs a little keeper by <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> and he s got six rushing touchdowns on the year and an e in the end zone out to the 25 so well look at this dallas cowboys defense that will check into this game fifth overall theyre good against the run theyre top ten in both categories against the run and the pass <person player="tyrone crawford" race="nonwhite" position="DE">tyrone crawford</person> is out <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> is in there for him and those two good young linebackers complement each other well vander ashton <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> and a very underrated secondary for the pro bowler <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> at corner now <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> out of the backfield it s payton barbour now to the 31 a gain of six this attempt they often sits had their problems running the football and so youre going to see cowboys play a lot of coverage and try to disrupt that man right there <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> off the line of scrimmage we saw them one time they went man the man on the outside against <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> on that first drive he had the big play down the left sideline we try to limit that as best they can first effort as a flag flies in its payton <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> a gain of three but i came in late to did it did all the way from the secondary offense number sixty six to ten your penalty replay second down no who s out there for the dallas cowboys right now as the hold is against <person player="ryan jensen" race="white" position="OT">ryan jensen</person> that is his fifth holding call of the year his 11th penalty with <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charlton</person> missed three games with a bad shoulder then was benched for two games they feel like the message has been delivered i dont know what message needs to be delivered but a guy that was drafted in the first round a year ago is getting another shot so well keep an eye on 97 down here at the bottom it s the fourth buccaneer penalty of this first quarter <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> steps up and hits rogers out of the backfield to the 31 van dhiresh there to trip them up a gain of seven so a third down coming up this tampa bay offense that comes in number two in the league and converting on third down the league s best the indianapolis colts its third and four the tampa bay team has been good on third down like you said not good on sunday against the ravens and then lost where they were just three of 10 a lot of drop passes on a wet day in baltimore gregor he came across early and he s there for the sack but well see if the penalties against him and it will be and this will be a first down by penalty offside defense number 94 that fiveyard penalty results in a first down they <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> he s not opposed to having a few penalties called against him ego and he s working against <person player="donovan smith" race="UNK" position="OT">donovan smith</person> who has been starting every game in you know he s a big man he s six six and 340 pounds is what theyve got him listed at he s probably even a little bigger than that and you can beat those type guys with speed that s certainly the strength of <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> just came off the ball a little too early <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> passes complete over middle and very near first down yardage is <person player="chris godwin" race="UNK" position="WR">chris godwin</person> a game of ten and theyre going to give him a first down here s charissa thompson with a game break thanks joe so the eagle charlie the seventh seed in the nfc still alive for the nfc east title as well nick bulls passes to darren sproles for this 37yard touchdown texans without a field goal eagles up seven joe toye down all right karissa so not only do they have been close at quarterback but another darren sproles is a difference maker the backfield it gets that touchdown as <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">peyton barber</person> carries for five over the left side the division is still not out of the grasp of the philadelphia eagles but they would have to win out today and next week and dallas would have to lose today and next week washington lost to tennessee yesterday <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> bangs end pass is caught by evans who kind of lunges and launches himself into that pass for 10 theyre mixing things up on the defensive side of the ball and when <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> sees oneonone id do the same thing id go right to <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> and we could have thrown them a little bit easier ball to handle but evans is able to come back and make a play on that i like what dirk cutter and this offense is doing of course their offensive coordinators todd monken who s been calling the plays this year first time their cutter has given up those responsibilities but a good start for them here s a hand out to <person player="parker ehinger" race="UNK" position="OG">parker</person> he goes backward in the end <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> is there to force him out that there was a wall of dallas defenders waiting for him in a loss of for <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> has started this game troy s seven of nine he s due just under 21 million dollars next year in the fifth year of that first contract with the only guarantee is against injury and so youve got a head coach that s coaching to stick around and maybe a quarterback that s trying to play to stick around and maybe even a general manager there s a lot of uncertainty surrounding this organization second and 14 blitz coming pass is caught that s godwin and after a couple of down weeks <person player="chris godwin" race="UNK" position="WR">chris godwin</person> with a couple of catches this one for nine to bring up third down and five godwin did not have a catch in baltimore and only one catch on ten targets at home against new orleans two weeks ago had a few drops in that and then lost to new orleans and he s gotten more work with <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> down the previous three weeks and that s a that s a good sign for tampa bay i know theyre expecting him to show some improvement like he did last year as they move through at the end of this season third down and five and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> slides through pressure gets hit falls out <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> on the return down the sideline nobody there from tampa bay touchdown dallas cowboys it was knocked out by <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> defensive score for the dallas cowboys let s take another look <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> does an excellent job of navigating this <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> and as he steps through you can see that he just gets lackadaisical and not anticipating you know any other pursuit coming in from behind him had he have just taken off at that point he had some room out in front of them to run but does not feel <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> coming in from behind him gets the good bounce jalen smith and he shows off his speed yeah for a guy who went through a torn acl and lcl and the fiesta bowl in 2016 didnt play that year when he was a secondround pick of the cowboys he showed some speed <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> down the sideline and nobody really got close 69 yard returned for the touchdown and it s 14 to 3 dallas <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> knocked it out makes a big play he s been hot well be right back after this from progressive in the bombers and speed zero marino so this is covered right yes maam take care of a boy right now yeah hi this is jamie we need some help right to the oxygen mask for <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> is he s gonna have to go right back to work and there s <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> who coming into this year it played only two games over the previous two years because of various drug suspensions as you said weve done a lot of cowboys games this year he has had some crushing penalties at times but he comes into this game into this game five sacks over his last six games and now he makes that play so he s got six sacks he s chasing <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> down who leads this team with eight and a half wilson on the return fills his shiftiness and forced out at the 29 a lot of turnovers for <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> if you go back to 2015 when he was the number one pick he is right behind <person player="blake jarwin" race="white" position="TE">blake</person> bortles who s been benched in jacksonville and right in front of eli manning who is trying to hang on to that starting job not just here in 2018 but maybe going forward in the next season well you look at <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> s record is the starter he s 21 and 31 career record coming into this game and that s a big reason why when you turn the ball over like that youre not going to win a lot of football games and and they have it here in tampa bay here s a big update <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> is ill on the side and their big receiver was six five 231 as long sideline at the moment as this drive starts the twenty nine and a carrying four yards by payton barbour you talked about how good this offense has been for much of the year however in the last two games both being losses against the saints and the ravens they they may struggle they have not put up many points they have not put up many ours barbour again well see where then mark him up at and 35 got to ross with the tackles so third down and four coming up evans with the helmet on he feels better under a minute to go in this opening quarter well already here in this first quarter down 14 to 3 this this becomes a pretty important third down for tampa bay talk about how good they have been on third down oh for to here in this one <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">adam humphries</person> started that play in the backfield and well see if this is against ross if it is it s enough for another first down by an offside it looked like it was going to be neutral in fractured defense number 93 that fiveyard penalty results in a first down there s <person player="daniel ross" race="nonwhite" position="DE">daniel ross</person> as he goes now to the sidelines but a lot of confusion it looked like defensively for dallas a lot of conversation with layton vander rash and how much of that got to ross but not cute in on the wall you see <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett talked into him and tried to encourage him but now another first down on a penalty you good you feel good after one here look great yeah early start for you get your rest oh yeah i know these home games are tough 14 to 3 after one back after this from your local fox station up on new year s eve the red box bowl kicks off between oregon and michigan state at 2:30 eastern on fox then flip over to fs1 number 17 utah tanks on number 22 northwestern in the san diego county credit union holiday bowl but at 6:30 eastern or catch it all on the fox sports app stop cackling its first down for the 40 since those games are on our network im not going to comment on what i think decision first down <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> throws pass caught flag down godwin made the catch here s the call holding offense number 69 10yard penalty replay first down another have now been 11 penalties called against ryan jansen and that s the 11th of the year called against demark thompson like you said they came in as the most penalized players on the team their center of the right tackle and ryan gents in the center he had one earlier and <person player="demar dotson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">demar dotson</person> is not going to be outdone so he says hey i got to match them and now they both have 11 and dirk cutter keeps saying hey my offensive line is my offensive line it is what it is that s the translation pass is caught on a screen by barbara faye not much and big antoine woods out there to make the stop by the way in that first quarter leighton van dhiresh led the way with six tackles not a pro bowler but a guy who wasnt a starter at the beginning of the year took over after <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">sean lee</person> pulled his hamstring <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">lee</person> is inactive as you can see there for the ninth time this year and vander esch is the top tackler on this dallas defense well i think the fact that leighton vander has just played as well as he has is it s really the reason why sean tinley is inactive he only got seven snaps last week against the peg guess who made that play yeah let me guess leighton vandura yeah so you know obviously he is really played while he s had a heck of a rookie season and the thought was that shawn <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">lee</person> probably wouldnt get many more snaps than the seven he had last week so why activate him where they could activate somebody else and so theyre going to give him a little bit more time obviously shawn <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">lee</person> is a terrific player he s had a great career when he has been healthy but their ability to arrest him is is or the statement on how great layton band rest has been third down pass is caught for the first down <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">adam humphries</person> who is a really good player undrafted out of clemson he s been active already in this game he has a careerhigh in catches and he is a free agent to be and hell get a lot of attention well i sure will and and what was it our heads fetus said that you almost anticipate seeing him playing for the patriots catching a hundred balls a year and that s our great sage in the midst at man its feely said he s just that he s the prototypical future new england patriot and like a hundred catch a year ago well i will tell you that tom brady would love him <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> loves him and anyone else that throws him footballs because all he does was get open and catch the football here s barbour dancin <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">jeff</person> he need to stop another flag on the play so theyre going to call defensive holding as is the signal holding defense number 93 that fiveyard penalty will be added to the end of the run automatic first down so guilty of an offside a moment ago now a defensive hold and it s <person player="daniel ross" race="nonwhite" position="DE">daniel ross</person> grabbing a hold yeah that s a good call that s a technique you could probably catch on every play they usually hide it a little bit better than that they hold up a guy they got latent banarasi shooting the gap and the offensive lineman who s responsible for picking him up was being held by ross that s the third cowboy defensive penalty that s given tampa bay an automatic first down wilson the kick returner and bobo makes catch number two on the year a gain of just three as damian wilson is out there to make it stop theyre trying to get the ball out quick we weve seen a couple of shots by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> but for the most part he s been working the underneath coverages and then get it get the ball out like he did there try to avoid this pass <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> stay ahead of the change as long as they dont have the penalties one on one right now across the board bass is to evans he was open he was working against the wounds ei the pass incomplete is <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> missed him and here s curt menefee with a game break and here s jadeveon clowney doing it for the houston texans getting the sack stripped and fumble recovery of nick foles of the eagles one play later deshaun <person player="justin watson" race="white" position="WR">watson</person> takes it in houston with a 107 lead over philly if they win they wrap up the afc south if the eagles lose is going to be almost impossible for them to make the playoff think about how houston started theyre the number two seed in the afc playoff picture third down and seven here mass is caught for the first down <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> again a gain of nine on third down and <person player="xavier woods" race="nonwhite" position="DB">xavier woods</person> was out there <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> what a first half he s happy and this is a good throw by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> the cowboys they bring the blitz you see the route by <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> which creates the separation but then <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> has to hang in there no one that there s going to be a free rusher and put it on the money and and he s able to do that he wasnt able to do it on second down on the throat of <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> a lot of that had to do with antoine woods who got pressure right up the middle against the right guard <person player="caleb benenoch" race="UNK" position="OT">caleb</person> benton knock who s had a tough season but that was a big third down conversion for tampa bay to the shotgun on first down this one floated short of wilson <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> he is he s been a little off and there is a little bit of pressure in the pocket but it s it s starting to get to him <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> was the one who was kind of around his legs but he he had a man open and and that s a couple times now where he s had guys and just hasnt made an accurate throw he s been sacked once it was a big one ball came out 69 yard returned by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> for a touchdown and made it 14 to 3 which is what it is now ten and a half to go in there here s barbara makes a man miss that was <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus</person> warrants flag again as <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> forces barbour outofbounds at first i thought <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> had the ball and had he have had the block a whole lot of room to run sean hockley will give us the call and not only is adam humphreys been busy so his sean hockley yeah every referee across this league has been busy this year illegal block in the back offense number three the 10yard penalty replay second down most of the time when a play breaks down like this the quarterback is trying to make it look good but he gets called there for that block in the back maybe a block to the side i didnt see a whole lot there my point is at least <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> was trying to make a play happen in spring payton <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> for a bigger play and he gets flagged for blocking the back yeah so that takes it all the way back to the 35 brings up second and 18 this one for the end zone it s not there godwin the target <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> and coverage and that was launched out of the end zone third and 18 well we talked about <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> making his first vocal selection this year and i think it was well deserved but what s interesting about him being selected was that here s a guy who doesnt even have an interception on the year and that s unusual when guys go in and both win coaches and teams vote they usually look pretty heavily on the stat sheet so the fact that he doesnt have an interception he made in his first pro bowl really speaks volumes to how highly he s regarded this year blame quarter see if <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> looks for <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> instead its rogers breaks one tackle but will be brought down well short of first down yardage i think that was i think that was smart by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> youre looking at third and long and just try to complete something underneath and give yourself a little bit of a better opportunity here on this field goal which would be of fortyfive yards during kara <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> out who is 1 for five over the last two years from 40plus theyve had their problems from this distance not here drilled by <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> the former kansas city chief from chicago bear and it s a 14 to 6 game 913 one more stat hey siri who leads the league in passing yards well a couple of promising starts two drives for the tampa bay buccaneers a defensive touchdown mixed in by the dallas cowboys the field goals put through by <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> in it s an eightpoint game with dallas back there is jackson takes a knee wall will come out to the 25 that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> is 30 and 16 as a starter in the nfl among active quarterbacks that is the fourth best win percentage in for his head coach <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> trying to deliver his second division title over the last three years and for dallas their third over the last five thirteen and three two years ago and up here is to elliott hesitation at the line in <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> games for brought down by van well it s interesting is this is just the cowboys second offensive possession that was just a nice play of the game that theyve run you know here almost halfway through the the second quarter after the return touchdown by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> there scott linehan and of course we saw jack <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> run it in for the touchdown on the opening possession and a lot of people anticipated that we might see some more call drugs for <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> after you said like last week he didnt have any he has a throw to jar win as <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> just did get it away and jar ones forward progress stopped at the 30 so third down coming up a gain of just two well they bring the pressure then off the edge immediately in the prescotts face and force him to get the ball out and i really think that the way that the colts played the cowboys last week is how you have to play them and they were very aggressive they played a lot of man coverage a lot of single high safeties but they gave looks they disguised the looks and then they came with pressure off of the edge and they slanted the defensive front and you give up some big plays by doing that at times which also were able to create some negative plays mascot protected pass is caught work to do and he s short good play levante david was out there and he wasnt alone is the safety <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> combined with david for the stop and it s fourth down yeah that s a that s an excellent job by this tampa bay defense to force a three and out in being able to get off the field then on third down once <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel</person> had the ball he made david miss initially in but they rallied and were able to keep him short of the first down <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> waiting for the <person player="chris jones" race="white" position="P">chris jones</person> punt and this is the first punt of the half for either side and it is a high hanger and a good bounce theyre gonna mark it outofbounds at the 21 and a 48 yard punt nothing on the returns buccaneers get it right back as they trail by eight fourth possession for tampa bay and the first three have all produced points not all for the buccaneers fumble on the sack the returned by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> the touchdown for dallas a couple of field goals for tampa bay handoff to <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> ends up picking up six and <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> there for the stop that was a nice game there but overall for this game you know they is expected have had a hard time running the football and that s another part that has made things awfully tough on <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> his rookie season they were 5th in the league in rushing of course that that season they had doug martin as their running back he was a 1400 yard rusher that year and they have not had a thousand yard rusher since wrapped up in the backfield <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> wasnt the first one there <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> was so he makes a play for rod marinelli and a loss of one there s no movement upfront at all <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> he s able to beat <person player="donovan smith" race="UNK" position="OT">donovan smith</person> make a nice play then on <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> bringing up another third down there down in five <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> has looked for humphreys did twice on third downs the last time they had it with success he s in the slot <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> back peddling as he fools and incomplete <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> who does not have a catch yet was the target but there was some pressure and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> was going the wrong way when he let it go little pressure and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> decides to take the shot in hati of work humphreys again he gets the first down because humphreys is able to make a nice nice move on the route he was working back out towards the sideline and had some separation so a good job defensively by dallas answering and they forced a three and out of their own <person player="bryan anger" race="white" position="P">anger</person> punts it means <person player="sean lee" race="UNK" position="LB">lee</person> calls for the fair catch and hops out near the 30 so the cowboys get it right back after a three and out by the buccaneers dallas leading by eight some of those owner alone and trek you order under six to go first half here in arlington cowboys with wall in an eightpoint lead thanks in large part to a defensive score by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> elliott carries turn what could have been a loss or no gain into a threeyard pickup second and seven how many times you see that too i mean you get him bottled up it looks like there s nowhere for him to run and he s just got such amazing balance and quickness and power it s rare to see the the combination of his speed and power at that position he s pretty remarkable has got great patience start out the year a little bit slow but it seems to be the norm for him and then he just takes off darius <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> couldnt bring him down passes cooper to the in season trade at the deadline from oakland to gain of eight and a first down that was pretty easy there the corner yeah he comes off the ball and the way that he s running as he comes off the corner meal he s threatened and so he had all kinds of room underneath he really is a terrific route runner i marvel at a few of these guys around the league those two in minnesota are awfully good the rams have a couple outstanding guys that can run rounds and <person player="brandon reilly" race="UNK" position="WR">brandon</person> cooks and robin hood s but marc cook was right there with anybody and he runs right through jv and elliott a gain of four you see what <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> did with oakland maybe not a fair comparison but he has taken off with the dallas cowboys and in turn the dallas cowboys have taken off since they got <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> who said a couple of huge games including one against philly a couple of weeks ago here s elliot elliot on second and six gets three in here s karissa with a game break thanks joe eagles trailing nine seven against the texans when nick foles finds zach ertz for this 1 yard score that 70 season two point conversion no good so eagles up well there s a lot of interest in that game certainly here with the dallas cowboys in philadelphia losses this week or next doesnt matter what the cowboys do they win the east the dallas wins here today they have the division philly still alive for a wild card though even without the nfc east the pass is incomplete on third down and three with <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gallup</person> the target and itll be fourth down you know i i know youre working the short side of the field youve got one on one and i like <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael gallup</person> he s ahe s a young player who s really come along but <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> is to the wide side of the field one on one and i really have not ive not seen anybody cover this guy on anything short to intermediate yet because of the way he s able to run routes and if i was i was <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> or if i was coaching <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> south look for number 19 every time it s oneonone fair catch near the 15 by adam humphreys so the buccaneers get it right back down by 8 and well be back after this from state farm and the orville sorry aaron i know this thing s but defense wins championships and were defending her truck now so state farm you can pack those khakis and go i was protecting my house should i unpack my khakis no you keep those khakis backed jordan how much time id say six minutes and were a baked potatoes dont do this take a message back to your people welcome to the galaxy me or bill premieres in one week on fox buccaneers are eliminated from playoff contention theyre trying to avoid finishing last in their division for the seventh time over the last eight years through four different head coaches the last time they made the playoffs was oh seven their last postseason win super bowl 37 in the o2 season <person player="jacquizz rodgers" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jacquizz rodgers</person> back to the line of scrimmage that s it tampa bay might be able to make another trade for jon gruden in oakland they havent won a playoff game since he was here just when they last when they won that and they won that super bowl but it has been tough you know when dirk cutter came in and his first season they but were 9 and 7 that year and but the the last couple of seasons have been been pretty futile second down and 10 two and a half to go broken up <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> is there to knock it away from <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">adam humphries</person> third down and ten coming up and these are two young linebackers who always seem to be around the football yeah they play with great energy and and theyre extremely fast so youre not going to get to the outside very often on them and and then once you catch the ball in the middle of the field youre gonna youre going to take the blow right now a big third down here for tampa bay knowing that there s two and a half minutes left in this half and the cowboys get the ball to start the second half if the cowboys make a stop here they leave plenty of time on the clock to do something and then get the ball right back to start the third the way a game call delay of game offense fiveyard penalty they didnt even look really all that close to being ready to snap the ball and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> s asking why didnt they reset the play clock that is seven penalties five against the tampa bay offense and the blocks come in that the 4th most penalties called against him in the nfl well davis <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> has to know what the play clock is showing and that can happen fourman <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> on third down and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> is set back near the 2 and the play is made by malik collins 2nd cowboys sack of this game and a lamar pet he s their best offensive lineman at malik collins he s able to get around him and you see theyre trying to pick him up then with <person player="donovan smith" race="UNK" position="OT">donovan smith</person> the left tackle but that s a good move this defensive front coming off arguably their worst game of the year and that loss to the colts and then theyve been challenged theyve been challenged by rod marinelli and of course chris rashard who run this defense and theyve answered the bell theyve done a nice job up front that s backtoback three and outs of the dallas defense has forced the cowboys took their first timeout under two and a half to go short set up track and hits a good one just outside the 40 a little now and to the tampa bay 45 and with 209 remaining in the first half we will welcome you back inside the broadcast booth im joe block along with a hall of famer troy aikman a little back and forth back and forth the defensive score for the dallas cowboys but offensively they really have not been able to sustain much themselves no theyre not and i think that tampa bay defensively has to feel pretty good about that i mean theyve been able to hold up theyve only given up the 1 touchdown and and yet tampa bay like we talked about coming in offensively for them to win this game their offense was going to have to carry them you know as that s been a strength of this team throughout the season but theyve just not been able to get it going it seems like when they are able to put a few plays together they invariably have a penalty that kills them best starting field position of the passes behind jawan absolutely wide open and <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> missed and through behind him and john wooden could not adjust yeah this is tough he s got he s got some pressure in his face but jar went is so open they just lay that anywhere near him and he s able to make a play on the ball and you know that s some of the things that jimmy <person player="isaiah johnson" race="nonwhite" position="DB">johnson</person> and i were talking about on the pregame show that some of that is is just going to come with that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> but there are some things that will improve as he continues to grow <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> keeps and that didnt fool anybody nasa made the play a loss and so that best starting field position is we are at a minute 59 left in the half isnt doing much for dallas as they lead by eight third and long coming for the cowboys when we return all theyve been waiting the intent yeah good get they get the rudolph head down and they had their moment then the mass gets lifted as we come back third down and 13 or so was here from the 40 <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> short of it and now well see what <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett wants to do it s going to be fourth down a gain of eight <person player="jordan whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jordan whitehead</person> made the stop and <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> comes out we saw <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">brett maher</person> hit from 62 here against philadelphia this would be from 49 if indeed they do attempt the field goal timeout taken by tampa bay and here s what s coming up at the half here s curt coming up on the vesa halftime the eagles cling to their playoff hopes is they hoho host the texans the copes must snow the giants to stay alive and the dolphins tried to keep their slim playoff hopes from freezing over as they take on the jaguars hey were just getting warmed up the pisa halftime is next some of the best work ever by jim brusca back in the studio 59yard try here by <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> good hold the kick popup <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> 62 for a franchiserecord against the eagles and now 59 with under two minutes to go and a half against tampa bay and that made it it looked like by quite a bit it sure looked that way and they say that you know maybe not a couple yards about it but they say that from 65 you know they feel pretty good about him that he s able to hit those in practice it s just matter of getting the opportunity like you said hed already nailed a 62 yarder so they knew that it was within his within his range and that s a that s a nice job a guy who last week on his first field goal attempt was blocked and you know i feel that had that ball had not been blocked and had to have made it i think it s an entirely different ball game against the colts it was just straight downhill from that point on but it s been a bit of an upanddown here for that young man missed his first try after dan <person player="sergio bailey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bailey</person> was let go <person player="sergio bailey" race="nonwhite" position="WR">bailey</person> s now with the vikings <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> had been in the canadian football league but certainly more ups than downs for <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> to gamewinning kicks one against detroit one against it and his kick off what is now an 11point game and here s charissa thompson thanks jose the vikings get a 16 with a win and an eagles lost it helps their cousins fun stefon diggs for an 8yard score if i could still trailing 9 goes without saying but we say the things that go without saying because it s what we do broadcasters cant sign kirk cousins to that deal need a win to secure a playoff spot and go into detroit and lose that game and theyre trailing theyre about to brian s fine good coverage by lussier on <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> has he knocked it away that was a good throw from <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> it was a good throw and it was great coverage there s a lussier you see the hip turn there that the ball comes out you thought of woozy i got a handle yeah i sure did i was going to say initially after the replay i thought maybe it hit him in the chest but he s able to get a hand on it but you know typically when youre playing against a guy with that kind of speed and you have your hips and your chest facing in towards the field to be able to traverse and play the outside braking route it s not easy to do but he played it beautifully second and ten <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> gets hit passes caught by jackson and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> got hit and they threw the flag after the hit as <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> pleads his case and jackson limps away without his shoe defense number 94 that 15yard penalty will be added to the end of the play first down you see <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> and i dont know im hoping that the league gets together at the end of this season and is able to address some of these rules and the officiating that s taking place but i just dont know what a guy is supposed to do they get them theyre going to say that they drove them into the ground and landed on them and i understand but i dont see enough there to warrant a penalty so it tacks on 15 takes it to this 36 <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> throws underneath in the pass is caught by humphreys on first down a gain of five under a minute tend to go with two timeouts for tampa bay down by 11 <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> throws pass is caught that s evans and with forward progress to the 20 a was ea with a tackle a gain of 11 another first down pretty interesting route there by <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> at the top of that you see he kind of slow plays it a little bit as he comes off the line didnt look like he was running at full speed but then get from a big target this one to the end zone and incomplete a lussier s looking for a push off on <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> who has been called for for offensive pass interference calls and most in the league and the was ea didnt like that little shove but it s incomplete on the last no i see the shove there clearly was a shove and there probably was on the first play that he had when he had the catch early in the game on the 38 yarder in dirt cutter told us yeah theyre going to be complaining about evans pushing off evans is going to make complaining about them pushing off and sure enough evans after that he was trying to get the officials attention saying was he that interfered with them second down and 10 passes caught for the hit on <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> i saw him make a catch he hope he s okay he made a catch just about like that against the new orleans saints a couple weeks ago and this guy hangs on to the ball i talked about earlier when he goes talk <person player="xavier woods" race="nonwhite" position="DB">xavier woods</person> delivered the hit really on the field is a completed pass to see where the hair flows unnecessary roughness to a defenseless it s a bangbang play so i you know you kind of understand the officials throwing the flag but he came in with the shoulder hit contact was with the shoulder to the shoulder i didnt see any helmettohelmet there at all joke no me either i mean with the head action of <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> which was like whiplash i think it makes you think there s the attack to the helmet but there wasnt yeah we have obviously the benefit of slow motion and they dont these officials dont but the the way the hit took place yeah i would have guessed that it was it was an illegal hit as well but accident really cleaned clay coupla penalties now costly penalties that ive disagreed with on this drive sets up first and goal from the six <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> in trouble takes it to the two maybe the one and a half at a timeout taken by the buccaneers they have one left itll be second down and goal this is a big drive right here for this tampa team <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> does a good job of navigating this <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> in being able to find his way through there she s able to get band rich go on and get it pick up a few more yards but this is a great answer for them to get down here if theyre able to come away with with a touchdown before the half completely changed the momentum after <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> kicked the 59 yarder rogers carries he trying to stop him and jack was roger s gets in that s his first touchdown of the year and a big one here with 20 seconds left and well see what dirt cutter wants to do mean what is right now a fivepoint game good effort by rogers really good effort by him not a not a real tall guy just five six but he packs a big punch at 205 pounds and you know the contact made there by <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">jeff heath</person> but rogers just continues to drive and it s a great job of finishing there on second down kick the extra point trying to make it a four point game personal foul penalties on that drive against the dallas defense extra point is good <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> now 14 of 14 in that category and this is a four point game here are the penalties and you know what will come out after this with regard to this one by <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> theyll say well this is not what we want as a league with a defender landing with his body weight on the quarterback and you get that obviously you know why it s all for player safety same here but then the question becomes what s <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> s supposed to do i mean where is he supposed to go and this season started with those calls clay mathews became kind of the poster boy for that in green bay and <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> s over there that s a live shot of him trying to explain to rod marinelli what he did and i think <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> got a good case call one against him and then one against woods yeah it looked to me like with <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> that he was trying to pull up there at the burien and that s what he was trying to explain to defensive coordinator rod marinelli then once he had him in the grasp and was go to the ground he was trying to pull off doesnt always mean there shouldnt be a penalty im not suggesting that but i just i didnt see enough there to warrant but a costly penalty of course and then the one on woods help set up that touchdown for tampa here s the story for the dallas cowboys though they have to go in at halftime and figure out offensively what s going on theyre coming off a shutout at indianapolis the bucs have dominated this first half except on the scoreboard a twotoone advantage in plays yards time of possession dallas hasnt been able to do anything well the magic number for dallas this year is 20 points and if they get to 20 theyre seven and oh on the year when they only sports 17 theyre one in six the one win being against the saints when they won 13 to 10 elliot with that one and they do the cowboys are going to take a timeout and maybe is weve seen the abilities of <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> they take a couple of cracks with one timeout and get a shot at a late field goal here in the half yeah absolutely not a good job there defensively by tampa bay giving up those kinds of yards when the cowboys were running the football and now you go from a run to what will likely be a throw which setup max s charlaine and now theyre toying with 10 seconds left in the timeout they only need a handful more yards to give <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> a realistic shot at a late field goal here at the end of this half the 62 yarder by <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> means getting the ball to the opponents 44 yard line nine yards away from that time lescott suffers a sack and its feet of vega and that will be the end of the first half and another example of <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> holding on to it too long there s too many times he s had opportunities to maybe give them a shot at coming away with some points only to take a sack the play of the first half is presented by directv more for your thing that s our thing he hits the sack by <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> the force bumble picked up by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> and return 69 yards to at the time make it 14 to 3 it s now 1713 dallas here at the half and here s the sack to in essence in that first half veta veía gets it and the rookie makes a play a four point game at the half dallas trying to win the division today here s the feast of halftime starting right now any other news of this broadcast or any pictures descriptions or accounts of the game without the consent of nfl productions is prohibited that was today s game flow brought to you by progressive 4point game at the half dallas will receive this opening kickoff here to start this second half and well see what adjustments are made here by the dallas cowboys you see the numbers and it s as i said earlier about twotoone across the board in favor of tampa bay except that defensive score by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> on a fumble force by <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> is the difference who s <person player="darius jackson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darius jackson</person> gonna give it a try not a good decision and that s bobo wilson who made the tackle and he is slow to get up after a 19yard return and theyre gonna call the athletic training staff out to talk to and check on wilson and we will talk to and check on aaron andrews spoke to <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett coming out of the half and he said to start the game he felt like they got some good drives going but then obviously tampa bay kept their offense off the field he just said third downs have been our biggest problem he was definitely preaching that weve been running the ball well but he said we just got to make a play and get <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> going and as you can imagine guys coming back from the half a lot of conversation about those calls at that as they ended that first half yeah and im sure there will be in the week ahead on those two calls against the dallas defense well here s the hit and those are big collisions and you know he was kind of grabbing as his wrists let s say he took a shot to the to the head as well but you had to go back to aaron s report if you look at dallas offensively you know <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> completed 9 of 12 you gotta zekiel eliot he s rushing for over 6 yards of carry youd say okay well what s the problem well like <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett said theyre 1 for 4 on third down so doesnt matter how well you run the ball you have to convert on third downs and to do that youve got to be efficient throw on the football and they have not been here in this first half theyve missed opportunities you want to get him eric cooper go and start throwing the football he s got single cover is the big receiver <person player="noah brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">noah brown</person> forward progress theyre gonna give him 6 yards that s just his fourth catch of the year no and he s he s a big guys almost like another tight end when he s in the game because he s used a lot as a blocker and so defense is when they see him come into the game they immediately think okay well theyre gonna run the ball and they generally do but when ive seen him run routes and he doesnt do it a lot he s at the top of the screen but what he does run rockies he s pretty good laurie cooper on the sideline flawless out and well see who comes away with a ball and theyre already signaling it s dallas s ball look like <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">dalton schultz</person> may have come in and it was the rookie tight end who recovered it carleton davis is the one that knocked it out of the arms of <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> and <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">schultz</person> yeah it looked like nassif carl nassif it looked like had a chance right there 94 to maybe make a play on it he s not able to <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">schultz</person> is able to but this tampa defense has not gotten a lot of takeaways this year but in the last four games they they have done a great job with ten takeaways there s a missed opportunity third down and five and now drop by elliott and i dont know that that play was going anywhere anyway and this has been a almost a total misfire by the cowboys offense except for that early possession when <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> ended up carrying the ball in but they cannot convert on third down there 1 for 5 youre gonna see the tight end come into the middle and these are some of the throws that i talked about with <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak</person> that is this you see that hole right there in the middle and theyre just missed opportunities when you anticipate open field open middle of the field you got a receiver take in the middle of the field do you anticipate that that s the guy and i just dont see a lot of that within this passing game tap it down after the punt by the lefty <person player="chris jones" race="white" position="P">chris jones</person> it s a three and out and a near turnover buccaneers have it bound for there s eve at 2:30 eastern on fox and the fox sports app today ziva sponsored by progressive insurance handing off big savings to you well good starting field position while at the 36 yard line of tampa bay as they trail by four <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> keeps throws over the middle nice throw and catch <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> takes it into dallas territory to the 47 aaron give us the tampa bay report well <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> first of all guys is getting worked on on the sidelines we saw him in that first half he got stepped on by leighton bandura she s questionable with a foot injury to return i did speak with dirk cutter going into halftime he said loved what this team did in the first half want to try to run the ball have to help out the tackles because dallas is <person player="cooper rush" race="white" position="QB">rush</person> is ferocious and off here to payton barbour and a gain of just one deshawn jackson who is troy said earlier and here he comes missed three straight games with a thumb injury to get him back today and he comes in with a little limp on second down and nine he s still a guy at 33 years old you know arguably the fastest player in football even at that age and hell strike a little fear and a defensive back but he s at the top of the screen and theyre locked up right now on him 101 that s a lussier across from impacts is caught that is it first down and more spinning down to the 26 is <person player="chris godwin" race="UNK" position="WR">chris godwin</person> and the offense for the buccaneers big chunks now a gain of 20 well good job of working back through the ball and godwin he s had some issues with fumbles after he s had these receptions he s got four fumbles on the year which is a ton for anyone who s not a quarterback heapd he hit he had the ball in both arms as he was running up the sideline in a blank the ball sitting at the dallas 26 next anisette met near the 34 by <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> who didnt have one for three straight games and now he breaks through up to nine and a half on the year well he s in the middlee they tried to give help we heard erin andrews talk about dirt cutter saying we need to help those tackles well they they do they make they slide the right guard then a knock to try to help out with des mark <person player="demar dotson" race="nonwhite" position="OT">dotson</person> but <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> he s able to split that and get <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> on the ground loss of eight third sack for dallas in this game <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> floats it for evans pass broken up and that good match up with <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> to bring up third and 18 there s another look at <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> and then the job that he does in in getting low on that last play that fell incomplete talked about it a little bit earlier <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy</person> gray <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">curry</person> s been the guy who s been able to get home here in recent weeks work this <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> was in a bit of a dry spell until then third down in 18 when stan throws short that ball skipped in incomplete it s fourth down as godwin got it on the bounce the field goal unit comes on for the tampa bay buccaneers they started the year with <person player="chandler catanzaro" race="white" position="K">chandler catanzaro</person> he missed four field goals for extra points and this is the fifth game for kara <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> on this roster with tampa bay and hell try a 52yard er yeah that wasnt very good by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> he had a couple guys wide open that could have made this a lot easier for <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> this is only two yards short of his career long if he hits he doesnt two for three on the dais centos a missed field goal gives the ball back to the cowboys leading by four aerial coverage brought to you by state farm as we welcome you back inside in arlington texas a missed field goal by kyra <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> and good starting field position for dallas as a result the way lunch for elliot gets one let s go back to that third and 18 play you can see by presnap alignment how much space is here you got <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">adam humphries</person> who s gonna run this the in route and just get him the ball you know he s got a guy open here on the outside as well with godwin that s an errant throw but if you just drop the ball underneath to <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> you pick up at least 10 yards who knows if you make someone miss he might even get the first down it was third in and really long but should have made that pitiful attempt a heck of a lot easier for one of the few big plays of the game he has the other by the way the rookie <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael gallup</person> for 18 yards and after that oneyard carry on first down <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> limped off the field well keep eyes on that as we replay the 18 yarder to gallop that looked like something mike <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> gallop coming off that wall he runs a good route against crimes and here s rocksmith he goes backward when it s <person player="rod smith" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rod smith</person> and not <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> because after that oneyard carry hed get that ooh that hit right to the left leg that didnt look good at all the knee the ankle but after limping off he s back in there well that was a helmet right on that left knee the fact that that s im a little surprised to be honest he s able to come back after just one play on the sidelines and get back in the game stick it down at sixteen pesce wide open left abound short of the first down but on second and sixteen both <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> with a nice pickup of 13 yards i had two guys then that ran with <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> and that s the outside corner you see <person player="carlton davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carlton davis</person> he he runs inside with with cooper and the slot defender he s fallen underneath and he s helping out jv and elliott he s helping out underneath on cooper and it left <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">cole beasley</person> wide open for the gain up that left sideline that was converted there first third down try both of for cents and theyve had some third and pretty manageable 33 started wars with kingsley first down a nice conversion as they are hanging on to this 4point lead the darius <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> on the stop need to go in quarter number three and their best sustained drive for the dallas cowboys since that first touchdown after first time they had it this guy with protection passes hi the talk nice grab by <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> why it opened but <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> makes a great catch the ball just sails on on deck and when he misses he usually does miss high especially over the middle but that s a that s a really good catch by <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">cole beasley</person> itll go up and in with strong hands pull that one in youll see now the talk coming into this game was how bad tampa bay has been in the red zone last in the league the struggles the cowboys have had offensive ly second to last in the leg zone offensively or the cowboys and some say just keep handing it to 21 on first down he gets six brought down by <person player="jordan whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jordan whitehead</person> i think usually whenever youre struggling in any area if youve got 21 back there he just handed to 21 he he usually makes good things happen good game there on first down picking up six yards there s mark tupper who took over in midoctober for mike smith its defensive coordinator it has been an improved group since he started calling the shots defensively mark him out of bounds looks like a first and goal <person player="adarius taylor" race="UNK" position="LB">taylor</person> out there to force them out and it will be first and goal this dallas cowboys offenses last in the league in goal to go offense and converting those opportunities into touchdowns and conversely the buccaneers defense is last in stopping goal to goal efforts teams are 11 for 11 punching it into the end zone in this situation to the line of scrimmage second and goal well something s got to give here yeah it was a nice job on first down anyway by tampa bay see i i dont know i like <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> there s scott linehan he s the one who has to make the call not me but i think i just give it to him two more times in three more if that s what a tough here s a toss to cooper that didnt work in a great play made by <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> he was there he brings down cooper back to the ten it goes down as a run and a loss of seven well they completely turned jpp loosed <person player="dalton schultz" race="white" position="TE">schultz</person> the tight end i dont know if he was anticipating that pierre <person player="joe thomas" race="nonwhite" position="LB">thomas</person> excuse me <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> puffier was going to appear paul <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> was going to try to widen that but they completely turn him loose it s not the right guy to turn free when the action is coming right at him so now third and goal back quick throw <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> reaches and didnt get it theyre going to mark him out at the two as <person player="jordan whitehead" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jordan whitehead</person> made the stop and <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett immediately sends the field goal team out there to try to make this a sevenpoint game well ill tell you <person player="andrew adams" race="nonwhite" position="DB">andrew adams</person> number 26 he shoots the gap and he s the one who forces <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> to get it out quickly and he plays it great <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> does he gets the ball out and it s uh well there you have it you said 11 for 11 inside the five first and goal to go first and gold go and tampa bay makes a stop first time theyve done that this year the 20yard chip shot im from 59 it makes it a sevenpoint game 3:41 left third quarter take a break and the kickoff on the other side okay try the new $6 king box only at burger king well the drive ends up lease for dallas and what would be considered disappointment just a 20yard field goal by <person player="brett maher" race="white" position="K">maher</person> they make it a seven point game but had visions of a touchdown couldnt punch it in goal to go and the red zone issues continue for the dallas 341 left now third quarter who was injured covering a kick earlier is back in there and who takes a knee next sunday the crew of the starship orville is back from creator seth macfarlane comes a brand new season of thrilling missions and epic adventures the orville season 2 premieres next sunday after football on fox as really everybody waits to see how week number 16 shakes out to see where the important games are in the final week next sunday around the nfl from the 25 nice start to this drive as he gets eight down by <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> sorry joy you know you look at this game in tampa bay defensively theyve got to feel really good theyve given up only thirteen points the other seven points of course coming off the the fumble by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> and it s a defense that had been giving up 28 points again and you just feel like after the disappointing loss by the cowboys against the colts that the longer this game goes on as we move through the end of this third quarter into the fourth the pressure begins to mount this is a cowboys team i dont think anticipated this cant be in this close at this stage of the game with the first down and still going missed tackles and more but a flag is down back near the line of scrimmage and now barbour is down inside the 35 but it s coming back second down against <person player="anthony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">anthony</person> on claire their best blocking tight end and he got ahold of <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> yeah he did he got his arms extended and then right where <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> in that hole where he was going then in that that is a good hook give them their due that is the fourth offensive holding call against dirt cutters tampa bay offense their cutter is you would expect that they have been heavy throwing the ball but they they have tried to mix in the run and maintain some balance like he talked about coming out start this half here s a ball on the ground <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> kicks it now has it inside the five another turnover by the tampa bay offense bobo wilson put it on the ground and sits up first in gold as <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">gregory</person> gets the recovery eventually he just didnt see the ball as it was coming into his pocket falls a little bit high but <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> was coming off the edge i dont know if he just took his eyes off it didnt secure the hand off because he was worried about trying to navigate bravery coming up the field shouldnt have been that hard second turnover by tampa bay the other one led directly to points on the return by <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> and now this one sets up first and goal from before <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> incomplete for <person player="noah brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">noah brown</person> the <person player="carlton davis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">carlton davis</person> and coverage second and goal this is always an adventure when dallas gets down here in this situation let s see well see what theyre able to do you got a chance to make this a 14point game they had first and goal from the 3 on the last drive ended up going backward and kicking the field goal it lacks a quarterback draw here with the empty backfield <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> throws down a touchdown for the rookie his second of the year a little breathing room here for the cowboys late third quarter that was pretty easy im not sure what <person player="brent grimes" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brent grimes</person> is doing he just completely loses sight of where <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">gallup</person> was going for a veteran corner in his 12th year you wouldnt expect that but the great job good throw by <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">dak prescott</person> theyre finally able to capitalize touchdown throw number 18 on the year for that scott and it is a 14point game in this game touchdowns off both tampa bay turnovers by dallas and a 14point lead for the cowboys 2:23 left third quarter sponsored by directv well for your thing that s our thing unforced error bom the part of bobo wilson that led to the ball being on the ground <person player="randy gregory" race="UNK" position="LB">randy gregory</person> was there for the recovery took it down inside the five and the cowboys able to capitalize this time on the touchdown throw to the rookie <person player="michael gallup" race="nonwhite" position="WR">michael</person> gallo 14point game is mom who is hit from 59 yards in this game forces a touch back and so welcome back inside the broadcast booth joe buck troy aikman and a little better that time i mean theyve had first and goal from the three the previous possession couldnt punch it in but that a nice little flip throw from that <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> to gallop for the touchdown i mean you look at the cowboys they really havent done much on offense it s been because of the defense with the takeaways you know that have set them up to get the touchdown jalen smith of course they get the turnover there to get that touchdown also and like i said earlier for tampa bay defensively hey shoot i think theyve looked really good of course theyve been planted on offense in dallas that has had their problems coming into this game but the offense has not carried their low on first down a leap at the end gets three <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">taco charlton</person> who s been a bit more active is there to make the stop for the cowboys were so talked about it there in that first half the the magic number for dallas being 20 points that they have yet to lose a game when they score at least 20 there s seven and oh see whether or not tampa is able to do something to climb back into this game instead is busy early not so much of late he s got a first down and weve got a game break coming from charissa thompson thanks joe eagle sex inside at 16 nick foles steps up delivers this one to nelson aguilar 83 yards eagles 17 the nfc 50 wins that game after winning at the rams another interesting day on top radio thatd be something meant to go third quarter first down tampa bay this one for evans might have been a little jersey tug by alou za got away with it and evans was missed right there yeah there was a grab was on that other side where you see the official was running up that boundary and not able to catch it theyve given them enough looks we weve seen <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> hit a couple of them but havent really been able to take advantage of some of these one looks for an offense that for the year has been really good it taken advantage of those opportunities handoff here too right into the chest of latent vander esch a gain of six pander echelon made of tim playing eightman football 8 on 8 on a regular size field that s why he can run he was a skinny kid put on weight drafted in the first round after really being a fulltime starter at boise state for one year what a pick has 11 tackles in this game theyre down in four humphry starts in the back field he is the target play is made by jordan <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> sits fourth down and the quarter will end dirt cutter with his team sitting at five and nine we decide what he wants to do during the break on fourth and two but well be going the other way back after this from your local fox station download from the app store today well you kind of feel like if the buccaneers want a chance to make this a game again theyve got to convert first play in the fourth quarter fourth down and to the ball at their own 45 down by 14 theyre 8 for 11 on fourth down this year cowboys opponents are 3 for 9 detection runs out passes underneath in a nice pickup by rogers for the first down out to midfield <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> was down here one on one with a woozy a and i thought this is where <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> was going to go he had a step on him and he s coming off the field now but what a good job by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> when he elected not to take that shot fourth and short and navigate in the pocket picking it up good protection pass is caught by barbara layton vandura puts an end to that play a gain of four they had a chance for until exactly who it was but he had time in the pocket and had someone was coming into the middle of the field for what would have been a really big play a nice design offensively looks like this shawn jackson still isnt right got stepped on earlier in this game and has been jogging around with a limp ever since second in six there s <person player="jaylon smith" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jaylon smith</person> third down coming up and if they went for it on fourth and at their own 45 theyre gonna have two downs if they need it to pick up the next five yards it s been pretty tough sledding for payton barbour running the football his longest run on the day just eight yards and jalen smet he filled that hole the way you draw it up third down past to the sideline and caught quiet evans enough for a first down it s a great job by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> there theyre locked up mantoman and good coverage is good tight coverage by <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> and and he just turns it loose say he he sees what he has out there and there was no hesitation whatsoever on <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> s part he threw a rope out to evans on that boundary now mike is closing in on the singleseason receiving yards record for the buccaneers franchise he s 11 yards short mark carriers 1422 that he put up in 89 <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> breaks a tackle and has another first down buccaneers now in a position where they can make this a game again a gain of 13 <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> missed a tackle they this time to sean jackson he s talking to the coaches over on the sidelines he s got one on one this time with a lussier he runs by him and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> initially looked like he was going to get it to him but he decides to work elsewhere there s there s been opportunities to at least take some shots first guy there was quran read and jackson checks back in this is the 17th game for <person player="desean jackson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">desean jackson</person> against the dallas cowboys and over the first 16 over 1,100 receiving yards between his time with the eagles and the redskins he has one catch for 24 yards in this one he s working against <person player="byron jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">byron jones</person> this time at the top right devon s at the bottom brush your tongue and the pass is caught to the 20 by cameron great and so just avoiding the sack was <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> he turned it into a completion it looks like they took a yard off and they market it to 21 third down and six sean jackson comes hobbling off the field again <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> steps through trouble will run and depends on where they market i think he s going to be a little bit short joe that s a that s a heck of a job by leighton vander rash in the open field and give <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> some credit to knowing where he had to get to to try to pick it up and he didnt shy away from the contact at all and it is fourth down and inches and going for it again second fourth down try their one for one on this drive and this is the 14th play of this drive wow they just committed a delay of game the play clock was at zero the flag flew you could see the play clock but now a conference and maybe there s something else that happened and <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett doesnt look pleased you know the players or not there s really not much indication about what s happening on the field what might the call be there was some movement on the line with the play clock was definitely a double zeros for a beat but well see if there was any movement there s the play clock and then there s lumen down at the bottom either way it should be five yards you would think against tampa bay let s get it before the delay of game by the offense occurred delay of game defense number 90 making abrupt movements which caused the offense to starve it s a fiveyard penalty and a first down so they called the marcus <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> for a delay of game and that s because of that little one arm movement that he made watch him on the right and all it did was eliminate the delay a game which was about to be called against the tampa bay buccaneers is <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> again lost track of the play clock well he raised he raised his arm after the movement was was made by <person player="anthony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">anthony</person> hawk claire it looks to me like they they got that wrong from just outside the 10 dropped off to rogers toward the end zone down near the 2 and hopefully we will be able to check in with mike pereira on that call i know youre watching back in los angeles mike can you guide us through this play yeah to me this is not delay of game defense you know this is not the old neal smith flinch it s stemming to get to another gap and you get the reaction by the offense to me i really believe it s false start all the way it s either false start delay a game offense and the cowboys got another call against him first down by pennell <person player="peyton barber" race="nonwhite" position="RB">barber</person> is swallowed up by columns to bring up third down where the more you look at that replay it looked like <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">lawrence</person> was just pointing and really not doing anything well he got a force a false start yeah he is my prayer said he stemmed down to move into another gap and when he raised his left arm it was just to try to indicate to the official that there was movement which we showed on the side angle from <person player="anthony brown" race="nonwhite" position="DB">anthony</person> <person player="antony auclair" race="white" position="TE">auclair</person> he so anyway i it should have been called third down and one <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> throws it out of the back of the end zone fourth down godwin was the target and there was pressure on <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> it s fourth down in one the cowboys they brought slot pressure and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> just didnt have anywhere to go with the football at all rather than try to continue to move to his right just just unloaded it and said hey well live for fourth down see what happens here fourth down and one they can get a first down without getting a touchdown they got evans here in the swat jordan <person player="jourdan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> across from me and the play clock at zero again delay of game often that s the second delay a game call against <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> and that s going to move the ball back outside the five now it s the second call and it s the it should have been the third time that it was called and then there s no excuse for i mean <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> has no idea you see <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett down here at the top he s trying to let alert <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> has no idea where the play clock is now back at the seven fourth and six <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> in trouble and well kenneth cowboys will take over as antoine woods made the stop half a yard short and that opportunity not managed well at all by <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> cowboys defense makes a play <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> gave it a go on that fourth down play ended up about a half yard short but there have been two could have been three delay of game calls against <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> just unaware of the play kline really cost the buccaneers a big guy go moves false start offense number 77 half the distance to the goal first down from siren that is his ninth penalty of the year let s go back to that fourth down play yeah initially theyre just trying to get a stick sir out there into the end zone and theyve got a corner route here at the top and but just really good coverage across the board there by dallas not really anywhere for <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> to go with the football and then pressure in the pocket he did all that he could but you know not much of a chance after they got that delay of game penalty here s eliot getting a little breathing room on first down and 11 as bowl allen makes the stop this is an effort as ive talked about throughout this game by tampa bay defensively where theyve theyve done a nice job though the one thing that that theyve not been able to do that they had done in the four previous games was create a takeaway theyve had at least two takeaways in each of the last four games which is really help theyre two and two in those games they dont have any here this afternoon dallas for all their struggles theyve at least protected the football three tight ends in there and elliott gets nothing caryl massive and there to make the stop for the buccaneers a loss of one so now third down and 10 and massive who has had a career year former third round pick of the browns picked up off waivers a star of hbo s hard knocks leading into the season he s had a great year took over as the starter after the sixth game of any <person player="vinny curry" race="nonwhite" position="DE">curry</person> a lot of money was spent to beef up that defensive front nasa came late but he s done a nice job rick said ive been throwing a big first down for dallas to colt <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">beasley</person> 13 yards on third down in town weve talked about out of <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> and what he s been able to do for tampa bay and <person player="cole beasley" race="UNK" position="WR">cole beasley</person> he s another one of those guys one on one that s a tough matchup for <person player="brent grimes" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brent grimes</person> does a heck of a job and he s made some nice catches in this game as well when he s had to go up and make a play injured his foot late against the new orleans saints hasnt missed any time under six to go gets to the edge another first down for dallas forced out by atoms a run of 12 well that s the speed that i just dont think you can anticipate when you watch this guy on film <person player="brent grimes" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brent grimes</person> he s got the contain and he s in a position right there you know theyve got the defense called in order to be able to handle that outside perimeter but yet he just takes a poor angle and underestimates how fast elliott is and elliott beats them look to the edge the guy that tampa bay s kept in check is <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> second slowly here s elly another fly back at the purdy holding offense number 77 that s a 10yard penalty replay first down <person player="tyron smith" race="UNK" position="OT">tyron smith</person> came in with six holding calls against him he s a pro bowler for the sixth time there is with <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason pierrepaul</person> he had a hold of him and that is now seven times the tyrant smith has been flagged for offensive holding yeah coming in joe he had six like you said and four of them had come in the last two games so now he s had five holding calls in the last three games and youre right he did get voted to his sixth football but i dont think it s been a very good year for <person player="tyron smith" race="UNK" position="OT">tyron smith</person> missed two games with a stinger you see that knee brace that s acting like an elbow brace for him certainly not all the way healthy here s a hand dr axe smith on first and 17 on say david makes the stop and we go to curt menefee with a game break dont count out the eagles just yet zach ertz 11 cats is 90 yards two touchdowns he s got one other 12 catches on the year most ever for it tight in nick foles four touchdown passes today 400 yards theyve got a 13point lead in the fourth quarter of the game they need to win to stay alive in the playoff race joe and troy wow so the super bowl 50 to mvp nick foles has a four touchdown day against the houston texans staying alive they want dallas if they hang on here they clinch the division but philadelphia is alive in the wildcard chase yeah that s pretty interesting you talked you talked about if they go on to win this game and nick foles and what he was able to do last year and winning the superbowl and that still a lot of football left to be played writes peter will see makes things really interesting there in the city of brotherly love second down an 18 here get back in there they call the timeout they have two left third down coming up timeout again taken by tampa bay i was just gonna say i think we might get the touchdown brothers to weigh in on that this week is that what you think one timeout left fourth third down and 14 here for dallas leading by 14 and knocking on the door of the nfc east division title they get it with a win here today it would be the second for <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> the third for <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett his head coach is <person player="amari cooper" race="UNK" position="WR">amari cooper</person> takes it up to the 30 <person player="gerald mccoy" race="nonwhite" position="DT">gerald mccoy</person> downfield makes the stop and the buccaneers use their final timeout with four and a half to go mauri cooper s had those two huge games here against divisional opponents eight for 180 and two touchdowns against washington on thanksgiving against philly a couple of weeks ago 217 receiving yards three touchdowns the receiving yards a careerhigh but just four catches for 32 last week at indy and four catches for twenty yards here today against tampa bay the punt coming from <person player="chris jones" race="white" position="P">chris jones</person> theyre attached by <person player="adam humphries" race="white" position="WR">humphries</person> well take a break under four and a half to go and a lot of work to be done for this tampa bay offense buccaneers trailing by 14 points take over four and a half to go in the ball sitting at their own 29 <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> with all day flag flies as great makes the catch van dhiresh louis combined on the tackle holding defense number 90 before the pass was thrown that fiveyard penalty will be enforced from the previous spot automatic first down they get <person player="demarcus lawrence" race="UNK" position="DE">demarcus lawrence</person> while this game plays out you know weve touched on it it s been written about over and over again locally in tampa florida and the surrounding areas about the future of dirk cutter their general manager <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> light and <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> has not had his contract extended i mentioned earlier that his 20 point nine million dollar deal is guaranteed only with an injury that s the deal in the number for him next year as <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> hangs in the pocket and unloads for jackson by <person player="jeff heath" race="white" position="DB">heath</person> but just an interesting sidenote and something to keep in mind if theyre worried i think they want to keep all options open or at least that s something that you have to kind of think about <person player="ryan griffin" race="white" position="QB">ryan griffin</person> the third string quarterback was active today <person player="ryan fitzpatrick" race="white" position="QB">ryan fitzpatrick</person> who at times was brilliant this season was not active and the word was well they just want to see what <person player="ryan griffin" race="white" position="QB">ryan griffin</person> could do he s been around since they got him from the saints in 2015 you wonder if they want to keep all options open going into week 17 they have a home game against atlanta cut off here s rogers and trying to make sure that nothing happens where that salary would be guaranteed going into next year who knows but it s just something to keep in mind and there s just so much unknown troy going forward for this organization a lot of decisions to be made by the glazer family i think because of that if dirk conner does lose his job and not sure how attractive the job look here s humphreys for a first down you know with the uncertainty the general manager what s going to happen at quarterback and it s going to be the tough decision that they have to make you got to have one to win in this league and youve got to evaluate <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> can you depend on him kenny stop turning the ball over can he know what the play clock is showing another first down view if you evaluate him and say yeah these things can improve then i think the guy s got a lot of ability and he certainly shows that from time to time and he has again here today is my first opportunity to watch him live but there s a lot of things he s got to clean up if he s going to be the quarterback the tampa bay thought they were getting when they drafted him back in 2015 under three minutes to go second down and two dirk cutter is a really smart good offensive line offensive coordinator to head coach here s great for a first down and so let s say this if those guys arent around in tampa bay next year if you havent looked there are a lot of really great quarterbacks that are available <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">jameis winston</person> would be somewhere and it could very well be in a tampa bay buccaneers uniform and maybe takes that next step and if their cutters not around in tampa bay thered be a lot of teams calling to get his mind on their side to try to turn around or further develop an offer first down for the buccaneers <person player="jameis winston" race="nonwhite" position="QB">winston</person> throws has a man over the middle that s bobo wilson to set up first down inside the 10 and this game s not over although tampa bay is out of timeouts it s not over he s got to get these guys to the line you want to try to get this score before the twominute warning take a shot into the end zone of course your line on the onside kick tako <person player="taco charlton" race="nonwhite" position="DE">charlton</person> cant get the passes into the endzone for the touchdown evans and a quick strike and a score and that s got the entire cowboy sideline looking up at the scoreboard to see the time situation and what it might take a seven yard touchdown throw to evans his sixth touchdown of the year look it looked like maybe a total bust in coverage when you allow <person player="mike evans" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike evans</person> to come off the ball and sit down in the end zone and nobody you ca1 ca2 react late whether that was his man or him trying to cover up for someone else and so now with 205 remaining this is a sevenpoint game and there is nobody comfortable on that sideline is <person player="jason pierrepaul" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jason</person> garrett is calling for the hands team coming in to week 16 there have been four successful onside kick attempts in 47 attempts well if theyve made it harder on these onside kicks to overload aside and just go knock people out and then get the ball and theyre trying to avoid some of these big collisions that they have and so it s made it a lot harder for team that s always been hard but it s even harder now than ever we have to have five guys on either side of the kicker and <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> is over six and you dont get that running start so with those two changes is they try to add to the safety of the game it s made this particular exercise hard to execute and it s van dhiresh there to scoop it up this guy said a 15 tackle game a careerhigh and now with those good hands he played quarterback he played safety he played all over the place an eightman football returned kicks you name it he did it is there for that high hop and got his hands on it before it took that last bounce well because of the twominute warning there even though the buccaneers do not have a timeout they essentially get the stoppage with the twominute warning if theyre able to make a stop they they could get one more shot one more crack at it under 30 seconds to go in case youre wondering as we hit the twominute warning <person player="ezekiel elliott" race="nonwhite" position="RB">ezekiel elliott</person> has put the ball on the ground in this game six fumbles on the year but he and the cowboys trying to wrap up the game and the nfc east two minutes left the fox today s gave a sponsored by bud light reminding you to not drink and ride yours two minutes left second down and eight for dallas leading by seven why that first down is the end of this one and jerry jones knows that his team is going to win the nfc east in 2018 he s huggin paxton anderson right there up in the booth paxson s a junior at highland park high school they won their third consecutive state title yesterday and his other grandson john stephen jones was the quarterback for the previous tube now playing in arkansas so a big weekend for the jones family i think they will come out of this game and it s worth bringing up troy in this last minute what weve seen here the last couple of weeks or maybe specifically today against the 28th ranked defense right now 233 total yards not a ton of plays run but there were some mistakes missed wide receivers wide open receivers not a really great game offensively for dallas no it was not and so youve got to be a little bit concerned you know here s a team that will now have won six of their last seven games and yet they kind of feel like theyre limping in a little bit next week at new york theyre probably going to be resting some guys this may have been their last opportunity to really put it together going into the wildcard round so i dont know right now anyway i know there s reason to be happy about the fact you just wanted a vision title but i dont know how good anyone should truly feel based on the way they played the last two weeks offensively defensively this can be a really special team and you can ask drew brees and the new orleans saints about that after what we saw here a few thursday s ago and that went over new orleans dallas wins the nfc east bonus coverage coming up well be back on the other side of the break is <person player="dak prescott" race="nonwhite" position="QB">prescott</person> in the cowboys celebrate smell that
