matchup you have the two oldest coaches in the league beat carroll is 65 bill belichick a few months younger still 64 so it is the battle of the wise men among other things tonight in foxborough and there is <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">malcom</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> he will live in well in legendary thought soon when you think about new england and it s great sports history with the red sox from the celtics and the bruins and the patriots i mean he s right up there with with anybody for that one moment <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> is back to receive seattle won the toss and they have deferred bill belichick always defers he likes to have that possibility for the double picking it at the end the first half in the beginning the second but he wont have that chance tonight <person player="steven terrell" race="UNK" position="DB">steven</person> house jump ready to kick off for seattle by oryx going off temperature is about 56 degrees on a beautiful night in foxborough massachusetts windless at the moment the wind and away we go under these perfect conditions sunday night football and taking a knee in the endzone is <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> let s take a look at the new england starters <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> michigan <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> perry florida <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> penn state <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> penn state lacrosse <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> arizona marty the imagination agency <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate

position="C">mason</person> georgia tech <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">marcus cannon</person> texas christian universe and that offensive line has stayed very healthy quite in contrast to last season for the patriots <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> starts in the backfield he catches a lot of passes and right off the bat he catches the first pass of the game for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and that s a first down so <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> is their main back but they bring <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> in not only on third down but very often on first and second as they do here <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has just been spectacular in four games he s thrown 12 touchdown passes no interceptions in fact the patriots this season and were halfway through their season eight games they have not thrown one interception all year for gain of 13 from the 38 yard line keats therefore blunt and he works his way up to the 43 as we take a look at that seattle d <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> michigan a table <person player="ahtyba rubin" race="nonwhite"

position="LB">coyle</person> university of montana <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> stanford cam s hasturs virginia tech boro thomas dbu takes it s desean shed portland state nothing exotic if you watch the seahawks you know they just line up and play boom belichick might sacred they just do their job second and five playaction <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> they look for somebody to get open and the pass is incomplete as <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> was the intended receiver he was covered downfield itll be third down in five shed on the coverage how about the protection to start things off here this is one of the best pass rush teams in the national football league and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> s just going to bounce around out there luckily for them on defense the shawn shed just never was shed on that play going against <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> perfect coverage for an extended period of time itll mend their leading receiver in terms of numbers of caches of 41 and it s third down and five that s caught and there is grot <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> having a spectacular season and a first down so they convert here <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is averaging 22 yards per reception and that was good for 22 now one of the things you want to do with <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> is keep him going across the middle of the field the thing that the seahawks love to do defensively is to trade off in there they have what s called sort of a star or a lurking player right in the middle of the field but <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> that time got across the face of that across the formation and there wasnt as much defense on that side the safety slow to react so <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> couldnt wait to tackle the ball at the 35 yard line outside and cuts it back and turns what looked like maybe a oneyard gain into a gain of about six or seven damn <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> back and healthy after the groin injury and he s going to come shooting up but the fullback james devlin is gonna give him one big shot he tried to just sort of roll out of it there are some big men that would be running into each other tonight in this ball game both these teams so prideful they want to just physically take it to the other second four on the ground again thatll be a first down as <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> takes the ball to the 23 yard line <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> comes into the game averaging just 38 but he has a 600 yards and he s on his way to a 1200 yard season i always love the opening drives of the new england patriots they do everything a youve seen every formation that you could possibly see so far in this first drive and all theyre doing is testing the waters all right what does seattle gonna do when we go to tight ends what are they gonna do when we put a fullback in theyve gotten a lot of answers already on this draft but they do now is they split <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> all the way wide to the left <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> will go the other way throws it to <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> and <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> has he first now that we stopped about a yard shy and then he was able to take <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> with him for the extra two so <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> another one of those guys i mean he s he s he s like berean he s like shane vereen remember he was here for a <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> time he caught 11 passes in the super bowl rainey was talking about <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> the other day says he s like the kid who does everything perfectly he said you cant even get mad when he makes a mistake because he s so mad at himself he s such a humble kid you could tell <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> really loved him now <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> comes back in the game and operating he s handing it to him with his left hand taking it to the ten yard line for a gain of two itll be second to nate for the patriots now all the way around the edge here <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> welcome back here s a guy that has such a great understanding of this defense and as bill belichick put it to us it doesnt matter how many bloggers you put up there theyre gonna put one extra defender they are going to be intent on stopping the run first and youre gonna have to make plays in the passing game ninth play of the drive perfect balance four runs four passes <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> goes empty rolls to the back home of the endzone and there s the flag <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> the intended receiver he had <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> and the only issue would be was a catchable or not clear interference and that s going to make it first and goal defense number 31 foul occurred in the end zone first and goal number 71 <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> s as his back turned and <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and complete control here just was able to draw that foul not sure he would have been able to catch up to that ball or not but clearly a foul agreed what and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> no signal yet here s to be stopped just shy of the goal line the lead now it s a touchdown so there s the delayed call as the official comes in sees where the ball winds up then <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> is into the end zone so the cap off this drive and it takes system 441 ready for his closeup and the winglet takes the lead joe tunney nate s older great job getting this one into the end zone there certainly didnt look like anything were gonna be able to overturn it with theyre just too many bodies ill let you call that one out well all scoring pleas are reviewed nominally you call this one that was just a big pile i dont think they could even overturn it if they wanted to what an impressive drive though for an opening drive and just workman like against one of the best defenses in the nfl for blunt that is his tenth rushing touchdown <person player="stephen gostkowski" race="nonwhite" position="K">stephen gostkowski</person> for the extra point so seattle deferred and no11 says well take it well take a 75 yards in nine plays seven nothing sunday night football being brought to you by verizon joined a better network is better matters by walmart celebrate the holidays with walmart find gifts groceries and fast checkouts by ge we imagine a better world then make it real and by mercedesbenz the best or nothing some images from the world 49 their fourth championship darrell bevell the offensive coordinator of the seattle seahawks who whose resume is pretty darn good all things considered but i guess if there s one play obviously youd like the hat back it s the end of the super bowl i think ive said enough about that let it down 18 million different ways and that kick is going to go out of bounds off the foot of gustav ski and that s going to give them the ball to the 40yard line is june starett or checks it out with the head linesman mike <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> be placed at the 30yard line first down seattle territory said 2:30 he met the 40 when you can when you when you kick it out of bounds well the officials standing right there and that went just to his right are left as we look at it so you he had the best view of it that s a big play you know you start offensively a lot of times against the england youre lucky to get it out to the 40 that s worth fifteen yards otherwise that would limit up to 25 so <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> the back is <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> our rookie from notre dame in the first play is incomplete intended for <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> he s been hurt this year isnt 100% but he hasnt missed a game the numbers are pretty good the rating is very good 7 touchdowns toothpicks not running nearly as much because he had an ankle injury i mean in the opener hurt his knee in game 3 but has played in every game and has let the stag do a 52 and one more second down and 10 or playaction goes deep downfield and lays it in perfectly the <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler lockett</person> he himself battling injuries but he s now completely healthy in a big game here of 35 yards beat <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin coleman</person> the quarterback and he does a nice thing he starts to go outside but then ducks quickly back inside and works his way to the outside so he sort of had body position on <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">coleman</person> right from the start and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> how many times have we seen it just lay it in there perfectly <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> will take the ball to the 18 yard line used to see a lot of action tonight you know that marshawn lynch retired they have thomas ross has been hurt they may get him back by next week certainly the week after and they had kristen michael who would be their number one running back but he s been bothered by a hamstring in fact he was on the injury report last week but he s active tonight but <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> figures to see as he has in the past couple of weeks a quick field of action here he is spread out he played receiver at notre dame and safety and running back so they love his versatility theyre excited about precise seahawks going five wide and the pass is caught first man <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> lose the sticks as we take a look at the seattle offense <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> im a whole pack of bad <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> notre dame <person player="doug

to cookies starting their fight in contrast to new england <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> and he s able to move the wall inside the tenyard line picked up their of six yards second and four well this has been an offensive line that has taken some heat but watch the left guard here part lewinsky get a little help there and then get up on <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> and right now theyre making at least a few yards running the football right at the new england patriots and that is going to be big if that can continue second and four the outside goes <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> and coming up to make the tackle as <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">flowers</person> tre flower secondyear defensive lineman of the university of alabama sitting of a third down matt patricia is the defensive coordinator of the patriots of course no chandler jones on this team they trade <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> to cleveland so this time a year ago two of his best players are

player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> glancing up at the play clock down to three and a third and four not bought incomplete <person player="jermaine kearse"

enjoyed watching with <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> now he is not the swiftest of athletes would you agree agreed and but he has an ability to dance around in that pocket and a lot of times youll see him drop back to 10 yards hesitate for a moment basically saying come get me guys and then hell step up forcing those defensive ends of run around give it

position="DE">flowers</person> coming around the edge as well major issues with this offensive line they didnt pay a whole lot for it and sometimes it shows second at 17 at the 14 and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> fires and it s about the 26 by <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> let s take a look at the new england defense <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">chris long</person> virginia <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">branch</person> university of michigan peplum <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">brown</person> texas jabal sheer hit rob minkoff itch purdue landeros the university he s got a hotel the university of alabama <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">malcom</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> west alabama universe <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick chung</person> the ducks <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> rockets will go ryan rockers and that defense right now facing an f p said here 5y for <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> on third down lofts it and it s broken up at the 50yard line a flag is down however <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin coleman</person> who was beaten before by <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">lockett</person> the son was able to swat it away but the teams are moving toward midfield indicating against new england pass interference defense number 22 theyre working on mr <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">coleman</person> tonight <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin coleman</person> had his back turned and really sort of swatted and hit this ball but there is a little grab there and just before the ball came down it was a forearm to the face i thought that was the right call at the time and the replay confirms it so that s good for 26 yards remember he gave up the 35 yarder to lock it that moves the ball into patriots territory at the 47 yard line and theyre going to just change the spot theyre gonna move it back to the 47 of seattle s is that the wrong 47 right easy to do so it s a 20 yard penalty they serenade him from above so back to the 47 of their own quick toss he s saying about the bounds of the 49 of england so what happened here he had the two injuries the ankle and the knee in weeks two through seven there was the the wrapping around the feet and ankles of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> and those are off so he still has the brace as you can see around the left leg but clearly more mobile than he s been in a while now how about his rehab they woke him up every hour and a half at home for about two weeks for his own therapist up from la to live there and the pass is incomplete intended for <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> thatll make a third down in six you know we talked a little bit about <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> being traded to cleveland there s his replacement there landon robertson landon <person player="elandon roberts" race="nonwhite" position="LB">roberts</person> is a big hitter but he s not that big he s about six feet tall and 235 pounds <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> 63 and 250 and these new england patriots linebackers play hard downhill theyre expected to come flying in there and blow things up itll be interesting to see the difference with <person player="elandon roberts" race="nonwhite" position="LB">roberts</person> in there as the season goes along the naive got four receivers bunch to the left side and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> goes that way under they get the first down as <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> makes the catch it goes all the way to the 30yard line and as the word of doron armand first down it s nice having a former wide receiver on the outside and he knows how to run routes youll see this one just a little in and out route he s wide open that for man but you can imagine how complicated it is trying to figure out who s covering whom at this point jimmy collins or dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> that time were gonna take it out and take it on here play action and attack pass along the sideline is hauled in by <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> for a 10 yard gain and the first down it s it s the premier matchup tonight receiver against db it s <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> and <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> two of the best players in this game and neither of them were drafted by the national football league a little out and up that is the marquee matchup on the outside in this one both those guys buried chippy players very proud both of bates huge plays for their respective teams serious 46 taxes for this season three minutes to go in the quarter that s a short game clock there by <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> covering curse this time <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> started the game ii 7 out of 10 now for 91 yards and you could just tell that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is feeling better well you saw him a few weeks ago and we didnt see him running and you know he s interesting talking to darrell bevell their offensive coordinator basically saying you know for your first few years everybody s saying when he s not a pocket passer he s not this he s not that now he is he s everything everything inside outside you can run twisting micro art urn yard maybe to hit there by but look and it s going to set up a third and short anything yet from <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> who made two spectacular catches on the monday night this past week both onehanded catches and a guy that is really as much as anybody the vertical threat on this team he has been stretching the field one of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s best friends and his wedding and this is about the spot on the field theyd like to work at the him coming back from a serious knee injury last year took lawanda they get up the pole speed that looked like he was at full speed last monday night <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> now throwing and incomplete intended for curse in the end zone <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan</person> orion was their inhouse good will come out again to try to make it a seven to six game for <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> he was replaced as a starter the last few weeks right there he is by <person player="eric rowe" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric</person> row who s inactive tonight so as you well know bill belichick will shuffle some defensive backs in and out depending on the matchup he likes he chose the right match up there so shuffling in and out i might send you out of town isnt that a few times it s fate shuffled off 31 attempt for houska is just inside the right pump right red zone trips for two field goals 76 thursday night we go to charlotte it s the saints against the panthers and that s the first of six consecutive games on nbc on thursday night from now through middle toward the end of december so youre looking for football on a thursday night nbc can you believe what happened to those two teams oh baby oh man excruciating losses it s kansas city came from behind to beat carolina and then the end of the new orleans game was crazy good stands defensively though for the patriots is seattle was going up and down the field but usually you win football games when you hold the other team the field goals minute and a half to go in the first quarter radian company ready to come back out house good to kick off with the third time <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> rookie from alabama he was there secondround pick they didnt have a first rounder in the spring so he was their top choice in the intro that star for the 25 when we come back on sunday night before christopher chard is the seattle defensive coordinator but he s <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> tonight and that is a huge loss for this seattle defense almost all the new england players and coaches said the same thing if he s not the best defensive player in the league he s close to it so from the 25yard line rady other things as you look at bennet from the super bowl his brother playing on the other side tonight yeah and i think his brothers glad he s not playing out there didnt really want to do that but watch some of these plays from the superbowl clearly <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> was just a huge factor in the game i really thought at seattle won the game he would have been the mvp out there just unblockable and for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> im sure he is not missing him at all so far tonight the bennett boys tell us the patriots right now his blunt get stopped for no game itll be third down and seven i made mention to that to josh mcdaniels and some other people about you know playing without <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> on the other side and he said you know with bennett theyre the best pass rush team that we face he said without bennett theyre the best pass rush team that we face this team is excellent <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> can do fine <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april 9 sacks he s had eight in the last five games so they have been redhot rushing the passer went to let it be injury they hope to have him back in a couple of weeks third and seven honey eight yard line some fresher and he had all kinds of action going on and go flag as <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> was the intended receiver <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> was back there fourth down peep carroll might be the oldest quotient week but he still has a ton of zip there s part of why that they can rush the passer so effectively and i think about 70,000 people in the stadium just said tell me the difference between that play pass interference the patriots got 56 is considerably shorter the title locket gets taken to the ground right where he catches it emperor 37yard booth spotted at the 35 yard line with 2 seconds to go in the quarter and of course the fans wanted interference here and theyre gonna let them play a little bit but it is become such a big factor in these games as in a now you know the pass interference everybody is forced to play oneonone coverage thanks in part to guys like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> because he gets the ball out of his hand so quickly so if you sit back youre never going to be able to make plays so youre in those oneonone situations and so many times now it s up to the officials to decide is that fair is that not fair and often it decides games no question <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> is the running back here only 35 <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">willson</person> flushed out fires on the run caught up at the 45 <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> makes his first catch of the night and that will take us to the end of the first quarter though england 7 seattle 6 and something that football resumes after these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by geico looking down upon that town boston where in foxborough al michaels cris collinsworth and michele tafoya sunday night football both dressing up like matt patricia the bearded one like the rob ryan stuff down in new orleans right yeah it s 1st and 10 from the 46 yard line we begin here with <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> you know you get to the second half of the season you start thinking about number with the playoffs for homefield advantage right now in new england what happened of course of the season ended today when wed be on vacation if the season ended today but new england have homefield advantage seattle there are among a passel of teams fighting for it they are but we have seen seattle over the past several years what happens in the second half of the season this team gets hot and i could see that happening again now that <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is starting to get healthy and theyre starting to figure out this offensive line and the running back situation second down and seven and it s incomplete well you talk about that second half of the season this team the grain at home the greatness second half and it parallels <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> to the team is 20 in 12 over the last four years in the first half of the season and 26 and six in the second half they were the first two months then you go to <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> 29 and six in his fifth year in november december and if this regularseason lapse over into january so third down and seven now from the 49 yard line fires over the middle passes man that s <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> and he gets tackled at the 31 yard line runner on <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> broke away from ryan that s a gain of 20 yards got all the big guns on the right hand side in this bunch formation and it s hard to not think about <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> and <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> and then all of a sudden here comes curse across the formation a big pickup there on third down now this is an offense that has not thrown deep very much this year but when they have incredibly successful 65% on deep throws this year and im 23 attempts and done it twice tonight flag a song plays list of dead before the snap just to give you a little perspective on that 34 percent is the nfl average there s six five percent offense number 15 fiveyard penalty first off curse started early and that moves the ball back to the 36 it was really interesting talking with both these teams and they were kind of saying the same things that the other team is so good you cant do stupid things you cant give it away with turnovers you cant have penalties and as you watch this game it kind of plays out like that it s just so closely matched definitely first down is 15 now final war with <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> give it to her in two weeks we ran right into <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> and knocked the back fetty the rookie guard at a texas a&amp;m leading the way right there and then youre going to see <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">malcom</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> come over here late and i dont think precise ever stop i think he thought he was getting ready to go all ezekiel <person player="deandre elliott" race="UNK" position="DB">elliott</person> just sprint off for his own that that is what <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">malcom</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> can do not only a great guy in coverage but hell come up and pop check it in five again he punch those three receivers to get a to play a look like anyway kristen michael turns it into a first down to the 18 yard line well the patriots are so just split on defense once they see <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> go one way and a running back go the other way they figured that something was wrong and yet it still exploded out of their watch this thing there s no doubt <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> or kristen michael went the wrong way did it come up with an explosive play seattle moving the ball it s 150 yards already there in the red zone again but theyve settled for two field goals toss it s michael taking it for a game close to nine now this is a very interesting development here that were starting to see more and more that theyre able to just run the football here but i think that was will to quaff you on the outside and just go toss sweep but there arent many teams that can just line up and make these kinds of plays remember though that there s <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> cable the offensive line coach trying to mold this unit into something but they are 15th in yards allowed the patriots are but second and scoring and weve seen that tonight nice and the big thing right now for seattle running the walls you say chris they were 30th in the league in rushing coming in they couldnt get anything going but tonight so far so good theyve gained 47 yards on the ground with nine carries and it s definitely unexpected i mean you look at a guy like george fans he was a basketball player almost no football experience whatsoever in college and here he is lining up at left tackle for a team like the seattle seahawks first and goal listen the play fake and the pass is not caught <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul richardson</person> diving for that position on the outside cant hold it in ryan is their second and goal yeah it was <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> who was looking back at the quarterback and this is one you really need to hit just a little bit of a cautious throw i think that time by <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> wanting it to feed his guy or to nobody and maybe a little too cautious and he knows it makes the catch he beats <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> for the touchdown so that marquee matchup puts a move on him spins around makes the grab into the endzone somebody analyzed the lead sorry out so many people love this little delay slant move and so this is a move off of that moves a little delay and then fake the slant and then just sort of back shoulder that thing but ill tell you <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> they just live inside each other s minds that was an incredible drive and it was more than <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> and these receivers and <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> it was the offensive line that took over on that drive ball when sir touchdown reception the season but hed gone five games with that s good for the point after and the kick is no good to his tip what get five extra points missed earlier today making a hand dozen it s called the seven 12 to 7 stephen houska has now had 3 extra points missed this season all have been blocked including this one by shane mcclellan not allowed to line up on the center but you can line up on those guards and then both come down knock down <person player="nolan frese" race="UNK" position="LS">nolan</person> fries and able to get through to get the block by shane mcclellan that is the alternative version i guess out of the jump over you know weve seen it all and that s the great thing about these two teams is that they they just dont give you a playoff no matter what it is you can think you have some advantage in some little detail and they are going to play every detail of every game 12 straight unanswered points i got to say i love the fact that they move the extra point back i mean all of a sudden something that had no drama now has a ton of drama just that s the new orleans saints how about that theyre going down they score what it looked like maybe the gamewinning touchdown lineup for the extra point to go up one point it gets blocked goes back the other way for two points they lose the game i mean this is drama on every extra point even though 95% are made but they said 5% it s crazy i agree best touch back here go to <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> in <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> going back to last season theyre the highest rated combo 15 tv s nine interceptions what second <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to gronk that s really no surprise 14 touchdowns one interception when <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> it s targeted from number 12 and you know really <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> you sorta started playing together <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> only had one catch through the first four games <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> comes back now he s averaging 22 yards a catch most for any tight end one thing about new england they were able to hold the fort rating i suspended <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> wasnt ready they had traded chandler jones and they were three and one by the time <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> came back in some strange way do you think it was the best way it could have ended you know cuz otherwise it s like oh wow we didnt need <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> but now they lose the game and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> comes back and just goes on this great run i mean this team is is a very tight team and sometimes when they get a little bigger cause the fight for or off it tough to handle and further burn issues bellatrix resume that s what the ball is that <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> theyre gonna rule it a completion now the officials are going to come in she gotta watch it to be rule d as a completed pass and a fumble recovered by seattle oh there you go it s gonna be looked at again all turnovers will be reviewed does he have possession is the question well watch he s gonna roll over <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> so i dont think he s ever down that forearm could have been the forearm is he still in control there i think he is and i think theyre going to say that he s down right there before the fumble if the hand doesnt matter but the forearm does previous play will be reviewed timeout and that s going to be the question and the crowd is shaded in theyre sensing that it may be overturned well find out we go back were back were pretty sure theyre gonna overturn this and new england s gonna keep the ball here comes territories <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> s forearm was down after review the ruling on the field is changed we see the dust complete the cats is left at the 34yard line on the house walk nearest new england s beds that will be third in one new england from the 34 yard line the clock will start on the ready for play there s your for army as control and that negates what would have been <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> s first fumble since 2012 about three tenths of a second difference there i just played by <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> to get his hand in there and get that football out so that sets up a third and one after neat your game tonight <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> picks up a ton of first downs with sneaks but this is gonna be really close and it s gonna be a first down so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> of course he he does that a lot from the oneyard line the one and a half and when it needs a first down very often this is how he gets it im not sure he even set a snap count here one of the great advantages the quarterback in the center have is that you can basically move your hands up and the center knows youre ready for the football but when there s no snap count a lot of times the defense is a second slow to react and you can pick up that first down and he s done a ton through the years and also the coverage is terrific by seattle <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s gonna launch malloy downfield into double coverage and havent picked up at the 21 yard line the shawn shed and that s the first interception thrown by the patriots this season so brainy extends the plane moving around and goes for the bomb and gets picked you know did a great job moving around the pocket but i dont know if this ball slipped because it got nowhere close to where he was trying to throw this football <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> maybe at age 29 gets it there with no problem but you could see this ball just had absolutely nothing on it by the time he reset his feet it just floated that was an easy one and so far shawn sheds having a big game here fitz first interception of the season <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s first interception since last season and so after they almost turned that over hadnt reversed they do turn it over for a gain of seven second and three i tell you i am so impressed with what im seeing out of this offensive line now of seattle that time it was <person player="justin britt" race="white" position="OT">justin britt</person> getting down on the inside linebacker and knocking him off his feet they may have finally sort of put this thing together it looked like it was just never going to be able to work the right way and they didnt spend much money on it but so far they are doing a great job in so <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> second three nice you know you talked about the new england offensive line and one of the reasons that the seattle and i said trouble up front if you take a look at the salary cap and you take a look at the what think what these guys are undrafted a fourth rounder a secondround her afet he s the first rounder buddy s a rookie and <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilliam</person> undrafted you know it s almost like they went to filene s basement for the offensive line speaking of boston boys are here they they theyve got money to spend on superstars elsewhere they didnt spend a lot there but so far those guys are delivering in the backfield contact and it s broken up <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> breaking it up intended for <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> you know <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan ryan</person> s one of those guys he probably runs a four or five and there s a thousand different reasons you dont want him to be your starting quarterback on the outside and all he does is make plays like this and he does it consistently and he makes big tackles and he does a lot of things really well and you could tell they took a shot they made a trade for <person player="eric rowe" race="nonwhite" position="DB">eric</person> gro they started him the last couple of games and then you just put this guy back in and he keeps making plays 7:48 should go in the half second down and ten <person player="alex collins" race="UNK" position="RB">alex</person> times the learning a garlic wall came out a bunch of phivolcs were gonna get there s collins now colin yeah fifth round rookie arkansas rolling in seattle ball third out okay he was down his bright nice were too buckled and may have gone straight to the ground fast enough before this ball came out watch his right knee just sort of go it s out balls out at paulette who got it did they have a clear recovery if they have a clear recovery then new england can challenge it well that s the question i mean clearly it s a fumble well the patriots came out of there with the ball just a matter if you can see it on the replay yeah that would be hard when belichick im sure getting advice from upstairs and decides that they will not win so they pass on the challenge when the intended receiver but you have a flag as well offside defense number 95 fiveyard penalty replay third go <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">chris long</person> so that makes it third down and three yeah going against <person player="george fant" race="nonwhite" position="TE">george fant</person>in of course he got the off size but watch pant recover and come back around because with <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> one guy very rarely gets him on the ground by himself so here comes the spinout move now with the all sides of free play and <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> just couldnt hang on to it 33 transpo s ice back into the backfield listen and he cant escape this time mink kovitch been doing that for a lot of years for the patriots 11th season gets the sack fourth down rob ning kovitch theyre playing them and leaving them back outside watch them get a jam here and then come in at just one over <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> that s going to be the question with precise candy hold up in protection but ning kovitch has not played well since coming back from that suspension that was a big play there it s the first four games of the season his first sack of the year the 15 by <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> and the special teams coverage he s good six minutes to go in the half 12 to 7 parks one thing you do not do is try to throw deep against <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> we have seen this over the years here s a guy with 29 interceptions since 2011 that s the most in the national football league and yet people continue to try and challenge him deep you can beat him occasionally on other place but <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was telling us listen i have learned the hard way over the years there s just no reason the first time i saw that guy i was like who is this i even know who he was tried a couple deep throws no more there s at the end of the game when <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> said man growing venice and theyll get written out of bounds by jay right close to a first down you back to 2012 there it is it s the last time these two teams faced each other and at the end of the super bowl it was a <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> who was the one the victor and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> went over to congratulate him yeah if you <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> side of the story is that <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was the one talking trash in that game and so he brought it back at the end of day i think that s what 87 times 95 were such where he picks up a price actually the second down play but on third and fourth and one he s a close to 90% watch out casually he s standing there at the line of scrimmage he doesnt look like so you just sort of loll the defense to sleep here it s pointing doesnt even and you know looks around like and boom it just does it and that s the difference with him he s able to sort of pull the defense on that the patriots went 75 yards on their first drive would they picked up only 22 yards since they keep trying to run those trap plays that time bringing <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">marcus cannon</person> across the formation but i think after the first drive seattle has reacted a little bit better to that second and seven ap <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> in the backfield <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> is split and <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian</person> goes into this slide is caught by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> and and a flag he s got taken down by the head <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> said hey no i got him by the shoulder and the officials doesnt work im right here ill tell you after last week on that field goal or he put his i tend to believe <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> when he s hell tweeted out afterwards and prove he s right for the proof is in the pudding facemask defense in the 25 15yard penalty first hour we told you dont throw deep but you can take a guy like <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> and with <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> in the slot make some things happen that is not the strength of <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> and it is the strength of <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> and is their face basket was the shoulder originally what i think so too rainey in completing in broadcasting gets john <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> is there and thomas that is not a sandwich you want want to wind up in perfect play defensively watch <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> right here he s going to knock this ball and then old thomas is going to make <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> pay you cannot draw it up any better than that make that big guy pay a price for coming over the middle no shot to the head perfectly done by both those guys that s the reason this defense has been so good for so <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> second down and ten ron kowski a little woozy and of course under these circumstances today youre gonna be walked off the field nothing illegal nothing dirty about that play just good hard football and for <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> now theyre gonna have to go over and ask him a few questions it s the first thing theyll do with him bring him over to the bench check them out one more look with the great coverage or old thomas with the big head that sends a message that s where you think you can attack these guys because so often theyre a single safety in the middle of the field so people always want to attack those seams against them but as a safety you want to say that s not a great idea and right into the middle of the leaves in the boom the back shoulder and it s perfectly placed and <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> thomas bennett makes the catch and picks up a first down well this is one of the things they did in the superbowl they started flanking their big tight ends out and sure is nice to have when you have <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> on the bench a guy like <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> on the outside with that back shoulder throw against the shawn shed then theyre coming over and the offseason the trade with chicago alert it before all about the 29yard line and before to play back takes it down to 21 yard line end of eight second down <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> right here he has been playing some of the best football of his career here that was a nice job though on the offensive line coming up and getting a little bit of push but between <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> and the number of tackles he s had the last couple of weeks and <person player="kj wright" race="nonwhite" position="LB">kj</person> right these guys have tremendous skills at the linebacker position second and three dance move to pick up the first down <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> with the coverage as we first intend with the clock now at three minutes to the half now when we talked about dont challenge this defense vertically but there are some opportunities sort of playing horizontally out if you remember back into super bowl there were a lot of those kinds of plays to <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> just sort of like in basketball where youre just attacking a part of the zone and maybe pick this guy and work the inside edge and all those sorts of things i think now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> s starting to come back to that and 11 passes to shane vereen most of those five he sets up a first down and goal at the three yard line beautifully designed play executed to perfection let s go and that s what happens when you get the when you end up getting the running game going now the linebackers have to try and fly over there and make a play and youre susceptible to that ball coming back across right to the line of scrimmage now tenth play of the drive and that takes us to the twominute warning that much time left in a good first half seattle 12 new england 7 on sunday night football <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> obviously answered the questions to the satisfaction of the medics on the sidelines so he is back in they line them up tight glunk is the running back it s a first and goal got two minutes to go im still trying to search for words <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> is in there on the tackle itll be second down in gold you know to me it s never enough to just be a onedimensional guy watch <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> come off the edge here i think he is one of the purest tacklers for a cornerback that there is and they do a great job in seattle training everybody to tackle they go in and then they start to the twisting motion they work on it but he is a topnotch cover guy that is willing to go in and make those kinds of blows 11th play of the drive rady flexo averell saying it s not a penalty official says no and that s gonna make it first and goal from the one a little bit of a gimmick defense there and the part of chris rashard youre gonna drop your tickets pressure holding defense number 56 half the distance to the goal automatic first down yeah this is this is not exactly who you draw up to cover <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> s plenty aesthetic enough but it s almost like youre rolling the dice youre gonna play and go attack them and go attack the run then when it s a pass you just scramble it hold his way for the call and they hurt this touchdown just keeps on turning those legs this may be the farthest ive ever seen anybody on the goal line at contact go sideways and not score a touchdown he must have gotten pushed <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> s gonna push him the hurt comes the rest of him and he s still gonna find its way through what a play i mean that s the entire defense tava rubens there and he just would not give up <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> the perfectly named running back well and and perfectly named in terms of what he can do after her contact since 2010 when he came into the league he leads the league in yards after contact averaging about 25 holding at that time was one viscosity for the extra point 65 seconds left in the first half patriots back on top 1412 the nascar championship coming away on nbc can shimmy johnson who win his recordtying seventh title that s next sunday earlier today <person player="joey hunt" race="white" position="C">joey</person> logano a spot in the championship for joining johnson carl edwards and kyle busch well see it next week next weekend sunday here on nbc and she had a little start from the 25 after the touchback sunday night football being brought to you by bmw we only make one thing the ultimate driving machine by subway try the reuben stack with corned beef limited time only by usaa official military appreciation sponsor of the nfl and buy a bud light they break : trick responsibly stay weekend rebranding boyer served as a keynote speaker the ceremony at boston s seaport district thanks to you all channel all of its time acts 25 no were his <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">coleman</person> was right there to take care of <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> steps out of bounds for seconds off the clock 101 left no we saw him in the super bowl about 31 seconds go straight down the field before the half so who knows you certainly dont want to turn around here and give it back to <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> either though so you really have to play both ways in this one little element of danger on that pass it s going to change up horizontally 2nd down and 9 from the 26 only a twoman rush youve got nine guys in coverage and the pass is incomplete locking the intended receiver third and nine seattle doesnt do a lot of exotic stuff but these guys scrutiny to matt patricia only these two everybody else is going back and that s what maybe new england does better than anybody else with a lot of times with seattle they play one or two coverage is great with new england it is as multiple as you can possibly imagine you have nine guys covering five receivers third and nine with the 40 so <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> big first down here as they make sure that no england s not gonna get the ball back with enough time for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> 47 seconds time icf to the halftime what a game dallas and pittsburgh but dallas pulling off at the end after those titans they win they beat green bay mario 2 throws for mike tirico looking ahead to the saints and the panthers which will see on nbc on thursday night all come up at halftime two timeouts for seattle now you got 48 seconds in the first half from the 40 yard line those linebackers up again theyve been dropping out from there you drop out again and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> stop to the timeout at the 46yard line itll be second down and four quarterback comparison the numbers right there <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> has been sacked twice <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> throwing his first interception of the season twopoint game second down and four from the seattle 46 <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> out wide you have to keep an eye on him five receivers only a twoman rush now with the send amanda and open at the 34yard line and making the catch is <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler lockett</person> seattle is going to use its final timeout right here with 31 seconds al that s a great job by <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> right there if theyre gonna rush too you have to take your time because in zone defenses they get spread why the longer you hold the football <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> learned from the first mistake he ended up throwing this exact route short this time a twoman rush he just stood there great protection on those two guys then comes back now theyre already in field goal range only god knows what field goal ranges in the nfl these days weve been there before now it s good and that overtime game missed one in arizona so did catanzaro the game wound up in a tie 31 seconds 1st down and the 30 yard line what you think <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> is looking like <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> now i mean those two throws to the left and moving around he s not running for big yards but he s starting to play like <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> again next one tonight and tonight for sure and washing fires <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> it s gonna get into the nineteen they dont know time asked they wanting it up there and get to the line of scrimmage you spiked it here precious seconds ticking off the clock 14 seconds now wasnt dancing around he s done <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> he gets free for the touchdown very very much like the super bowl at the end of the first half speaking of <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> playing like <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> how about that play im thinking if he makes some shore completion theyre not going to get a fuel go off and he still has time to survey the field if hed had taken a sack complete control and throws that touchdown what a play well <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chung</person> was there at the end but there was ryan covering him and you can see him looking like who s got him who s got him nobody has him touchdown it s just what we talked about the more time that a quarterback moves around the more zone defenses break down and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> broke that one down oscar for the extra point and with six seconds to play in the half seattle has the lead so back and forth we have gone on the scoreboard

there at the blunts just keeps on turning those legs better be careful here at barry and the catch is <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row a back and forth first half here seattle on top 1914 high above downtown boston theyre back to foxborough now <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> there are his numbers 197 yards and two touchdowns both to <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> got off to a hot start through his first interception of the season then 11 of 16 walter those four catches hadnt scored in five games but he s been into the end zone twice tonight and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> two rushing touchdowns now has 11 this season you know how we talk all the time about you know the patriots being the team that doubles up now sit weve got seattle with a chance to double up after that touchdown the end the half they deferred at the outset then new england marched down the field but as they did in that super bowl two years ago seattle s scoring at the end of the first and and now they get the ball to start the third quarter stassi s kicked in zone 3 annal to the the 5yard line well here it is the last drive and obviously the strategy was let s make <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> fetus from the pocket they did not bring pressure throughout that drive and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> start to show some of the mobility and he took his time he made him pay and he stretched those zones and as he moved around big things started happening for this seattle offense i wonder if were gonna see a little change in strategy here and half number two that strategy worked in the super bowl but that was kind of so two years ago <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> s figured out how to throw from the pocket now manchus forthcoming you start here bake the <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> on the outside by jimmy s grin that s a gain of three <person player="devin mccourty" race="nonwhite" position="DB">devin mccourty</person> making the tackle second down you know <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> for all the things that he s done on the football field maybe just getting back in the lineup after that devastating injury that he had and i think even he doubted whether or not he was ever going to come back couldnt even jog until june and now here he is playing at a very high level patella tendon occurred in the middle of the season too next year as he came over that big trade with the saints and now up to the 32 yard line goes <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> tackled by brain should we go to michelle well hell it was week 12 of last year when <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> turia s patellar tendon and he told us when he first looked down his kneecap was up in his quadriceps now the patellar tendon connects the kneecap to the shin bone and because the tendon and kneecap are both connected to the four muscles of the quadriceps regaining quad strength is really difficult and the injury has the worst returntoplay rate of all the injuries in the nfl hurts just to think about it third down and three at the 32 yard line the ocean im doing its job here and then he almost has an intercepted by a <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> trying to get it over him to <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> and his lucky that wasnt picked fourth down do not underestimate the athleticism of dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> here he is right here gonna drop out and almost went skyhigh to go get this he is a tremendous athlete one of the best blitzing linebackers that there is in the national football league to john ryan second punt first one is 51 yards the 14 jones with a flag down with more than likely the gate most of that run back picks it back to the 35 every genes starett or during the return personal foul clipping receiving to you number 22 half the distance to the goal first down to england timeout that is <person player="justin coleman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">justin coleman</person> moving then further back patriot head coaches robert kraft bought the team in mind before he inherited bill parcells from the previous regime then pete carroll came in three years here pretty good record two playoff appearances and then of course he hired bill belichick after belichick turned down the jets job so the steelers have been only two coaches cour and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> when the ravens have had three and craft hiring carroll and belichick so when carol comes you remember carol had actually coached the jets for one year in 1994 took over for lou holtz and parcells you know came and bill had a lot of control and that led to the rupture between craft and ourselves because bill wanted control over the players and you remember that story about hey you want me to cook the meal i got to buy the groceries so carol never got to control it there s light to the 17th and then when belichick came and he gave him control and well we know the rest yeah pete was gonna go to work and set up a football network he and pat kerwin had a big plan of what they were gonna do and he said yeah i didnt go so well and i didnt like retirement so and somebody came up with that i enact the idea actually did it a little later i was like yeah nfl network and so that was the year 2000 he said that time it wasnt for me and then she went off to great success at usc it s johnson as he throws as a flag down though at the 10yard line <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> on a safety blitz <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> needs a little extra and while mike <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> went pretty low at <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> and i think that may have been defense number 31 lowe hit on the quarterback 15yard penalty automatic first down it s always so tough to tell <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">marcus cannon</person> kind of got a piece of <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> coming around here did he knock him to the ground or the <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> just go to the ground and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> immediately pointed dangerous play we have seen a lot of quarterbacks hurt in that exact situation and im not feeling too good that might stir the pot in this game even more yep 54 so mike hasnt been sacked three knockdowns including that one and now for the 32 yard line one for a gain of seven <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> now has carried the ball 13 times for 39 yards i dont think there s any question nate s older probably the best of these offensive linemen here he comes right there not only get a table a reuben but then get up on the linebacker <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> as well and <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> all you have to do is turn it into an arm tackle and he s not going down second and three they bring the fullback devlin in just about the line of scrimmage every third and short you know how this team probably does as well as any team as far as if they can make sure they have the edge on the outside think about who they have flying up on the inside they have <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> and <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> and <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">bobby wagner</person> i mean these guys get there so quickly even plays you think are there they really arent third down and four lot of shuffling among the defensive personnel prior to the plate rainey over the middle <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> gets free still on his feet and finally slugged it down to the 45 yard line by the shawn shed inna 17 once again that bunch formation and youre going to have to try with all this motion going this way to fight your way through these pick plays and they just put and get to <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> shed couldnt and one of the things they were really concerned about was <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> and his ability to break tackles he s not a big guy but just a hard guy to tackle a little bit like duck <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> on the other side then time of the night three catches 28 yards the ball at the seahawk 45 the action then grady s going to get sacked again the secondary did its work and reid is able to come in or icky out of alabama the number two draft choice to get the sack all you have to do is make <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> hold the ball these can only have time to look at one or two guys here s <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> with <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> out there but that was really some play by jaren <person player="jarran reed" race="nonwhite" position="DT">reed</person> just to completely blow right through shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> and the reason he could look at that <person player="jarran reed" race="nonwhite" position="DT">reed</person> just pushes shaq <person player="shaquille mason" race="UNK" position="C">mason</person> right back past <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> and made the sack second sack for <person player="jarran reed" race="nonwhite" position="DT">reed</person> the season making the catch and picking up a lot of that necessary yardage is bennett so he turns a second and 17 into a third and about two the two best tight ends and football yards per catch and you can see why there s just so much you can do even if youre running with them remember they hit a lot of deep passes to those tight ends so you have to play the front shoulder and all of a sudden theyre throwing that back shoulder and linebackers even talented ones and safeties have a tough time with <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> thirty to play clock at one finds his man finds <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">danny amendola</person> his first catch of the night to the 25 tackled by thomas first down to england theyre playing so much attention now to <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> underneath watch he s going to be right in here and the linebacker is going to suck up to try and take him away and then <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> just throws it right in behind him see <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> there and then here comes <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> but there s nobody then back deep to make that play good play by quarterback <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s completed 15 passes tonight only four to wide receivers to the races close to the first down they bring that fullback in devlin he really does a great job when he s in the game you can almost be guaranteed that 29 is gonna get the ball you know <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">rob gronkowski</person> does such a great job catching the ball we all know that but what makes him a great allpro is that he does this here out on <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock coyle</person> and just going to open up that edge kick him out on the other side youve got bennett and he is going to almost take <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> a roll to the ground having that combination and having the ability to split him out wide as well almost unstoppable devlin ran <person player="bobby wagner" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wagner</person> over three touchdowns he leads the league in touchdowns with 12 and mr devlin with the assists again well let s start with <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> right out here watch this block that s the first one you need to get to the edge perfectly done and then al as you said fullback james devlin he comes around he gets to sean shed and here we go you dont see teams very often get the edge against seattle new england successful on that drive doing it so for the third time tonight the england has the lead and keselowski in for the extra point and it was 752 to go in the third in the marquee matchup here in foxborough 2119 new england <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> wahlberg is here tonight he s the executive producer of a new thriller conspiracy series shooter starring ryan philip ii is a marine veteran on the run trying to clear his name it premieres this tuesday at 10:00 9:00 central on the usa network there s a tshirt on a 51 degree night here in new england good ballgame 21 to think patriots on top results in a touchback so it s the suit ramon if the mood is closer to the earth the manga that has been in 60 years we wouldnt lie to you monday s number one who drama timeless travels to 1972 for the biggest presidential scandal in history timeless to see it tomorrow right here on in the sea seahawks have the ball for the second time in the second half down by two masha s caught over the middle that is the <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">baldwin</person> who has two touchdowns that i tackled my buckler dean of six second down and four there s your leading sacker if you are a patriots fan he played 12 snaps in the first half three and a half sacks on the year if there is a fatal flaw on this patriots team i believe it s their inability to get pressure and obviously bill belichick wanted to take a look tonight at <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey flowers</person> whose have come up with a couple of sacks here in the last few games those things are going to get tshirt we won next week never mind second and four <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> throws and that s why that is taught by col <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> and he goes on when the 30yard line over the middle <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> gets dead free and over the middle for a gain of 39 there you go the hard playaction and then you come in you have on the other side the receiver clearing out deep and there s that big void if you can force those linebackers this case dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> just to step up far enough to get that pass in over the top of them <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">richardson</person> is caught two tonight for 52 yards at the 30 now six and a half for a gain of three through the middle goes <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> well take a seattle offensively tonight that s 303 yards in two and a half quarters watch the move by <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> here looked like he was going to be dead to rights in the hole is land and robert stepped up george pant got just enough of him to knock him off but you can see now why everybody in seattle was so excited about the possibilities with <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> so you could patricia you got bevel going at each other second down and seven turn around get a flag here nothing but blue shirt she had gram going down the scene now dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> just gave a shove to <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> at about eight or nine yards and that was pretty easy just look at her now was it pass interference or an illegal contact defense number 54 it s caught in the file automatic first down c <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> right there there s the shot it was hard to tell if the ball was in the air or not pretty close but you know it is interesting no matter what you think of <person player="jamie collins" race="nonwhite" position="LB">jamie collins</person> and all the other stuff there is sort of a connection between starting inside linebackers so you end up now sort of starting over again with a land and <person player="elandon roberts" race="nonwhite" position="LB">roberts</person> and those two guys just working together patriots coming to the game middle of the pack in total defense when it comes to giving up points the second best in the league coming the weekend to the vikings give a lot of yardage with having to giving up a lot of points from the corner <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> again 17 to me the most shocking development of this game is how well this seattle offensive line is playing and theyre doing it in a multiple ways theyre pulling their young offensive lineman out of the front theyre playing a little power on the outside with their rookie <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine</person> betty <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilliam</person> who s not always known as an overpowering guy nice double team with <person player="brandon williams" race="nonwhite" position="TE">brandon williams</person> the young tight in out there are really good things <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> cable has done a job with this bus for 2077 rushing yards for seattle which about equal is their season average and theyve done that and west when the outside is caught by <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> hell take the ball through the 7 yard line and seattle have a first down and goal i think dante <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> here was a little confused he was coming off the edge and i think it had to be his coverage guy coming right there in <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> because nobody went with him maybe <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> just thought that nobody was blocking and let me go get the quarterback but you could tell by the way he was just sort of half speed going in there there s a little confused on that one coulomb comes over to the right side <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> goes with him now they swing it to <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> and <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> is there to stop them at about the 5yard line along with <person player="nick vannett" race="white" position="TE">nick</person> ovitch second down a goal remember what i was saying about <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> being a great cover guy and making tackles same thing goes for <person player="malcom brown" race="nonwhite" position="DT">malcom</person> <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> it really does he is unafraid those two guys you want to be a really good player go the probowl fine that s fine you can do that as a coverage guy you want to be something more than that being allpro go to the hall of fame one day make plays in the super bowl to win it and they like that second and ole miss not <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">butler</person> goes with first who sets up on the right side and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> is going to get spun down and sacked at the 15 by <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey flowers</person> that s his second second year guy out of arkansas victim the fourth round last year and as chris mentioned was sheared not seeing much action tonight has been trade <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> lewinsky is gonna miss this time and <person player="trey flowers" race="nonwhite" position="DE">trey flowers</person> i remember him so well playing in college he was an allout effort guy i dont think he s one of those stunningly athletic huge pass rushes he just was relentless and i really thought that he might turn into a pro and apparently bill belichick believes the same thing he s put his leading sacker on the bench tonight third and goal from the 13 <person player="luke willson" race="white" position="TE">willson</person> the pressure again but he escapes keeps his eyes downfield and he cant escape this sign he gets out of the pocket there s no flag for grounding even though he was going to the ground you know receiver in the area now a flag comes in so it may be delayed cool yeah i mean there was somebody up there but it was an offensive lineman yep bellatrix is moving back he s still gonna be in field goal range <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">chris long</person> with the initial contact just couldnt quite hold on well he got to the surrounding 10yard penalty from the previous spot locks it down fourth doubt that makes it fourth down and theyre gonna spot the ball get in the second around the 26 yard line so outside the tock tackle box but not back to the line of scrimmage and no receiver in the area that s a bad combination and bring out the field goal kicker making the 23 where they spot it so youve got a 41yard field goal he had gotten down to the five yard line house cook to try to give seattle the lead down and house cos kick is good 252 left in the third 22:21 seahawks said that i football being brought to you by southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that is transparency by toyota let s go places by navy federal credit union proudly serving the armed forces and their families and by tmobile switch to the network built for unlimited data friday night that s severe ian defeating vichy a fourth straight division once south tightly everett in a massachusetts state championship political bitch love high school football a couple boys poached it

third straight year robert kraft and nike have joined together selling the custommade air force ones that the bob kraft always wears a lot of other folks as well raising a ton of money for the boys and girls club of boston they hope to raise five hundred thousand dollars this year brainy escapes moves in the pocket throws let s go sell on speed has been all the way into seattle territory he has been a stud tonight as bennett takes that one for a huge game what do you do with these guys if you put defensive backs in to cover one of these tight ends they just shrink them down and then run the football there s <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> you talked about earlier some of those movements within the pocket look like he was about to take a sack stepped right up and hit a big play 36 yards on that play so bennett scored six tonight from 94 stopped running again three touchdowns already for him tonight he gets to the 30yard line second and one so with gronk they thrown to him three times he s got two but two six four six four bennett so his brother looking on he didnt make the trip michael back in seattle and at least the bros having some night really topend players i tell you about playing well tonight <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> three rushing touchdowns already tonight now leads the league with a careerhigh 12 then it s two of our favorite guys that have the league s interesting and funny to say second one pick up the first down get into the 27yard line then a half to go in the quarter i tell you the other thing that we really need to talk about is dante s carnegie and the difference he s made with this new england offensive line they were in a bit of disarray a season ago a lot of injuries moving people in and out shuffling around this year theyve been able to stick pretty much with the same lineup and that guy never asks anybody s opinion he tells him exactly what he wants to do and you can see the uptick in their performance this season retire for the last two years the pass is dropped <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> over the middle might have hurt <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> coming in on little cat feet i think a table a reuben may have tipped this ball let s take a look number 77 yeah like he turned it into from a punt into a kick off a little tumbling over the top there s a good play by <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> because that could have been a 15yarder im sure he would have loved her taking that shot screams <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> now in the back he only hasnt carried or as he takes it here and he s got the two pieces of laundry down on the field now <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> actually has more receptions than he does rushes on the season that s unusual for running back was his second area of the night offense number 62 10yard penalty replay second down for rookie joe tunney who was picked in the third round out of north carolina state which <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> right here on this spin move come around to knee and he kind of hooked that right arm around him im not so sure it was to knee that pulled him out of there as much as it was just the momentum from that spin second and 20 patriots 5 wide maybe a false start to make it a second 25 number 87 fiveyard penalty second out and youre back in your way right out of field goal range now so now as much as you want to go play for the touchdown you first have to ensure youre going to be in a spot you can kick this field goal we havent heard anything from <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> tonight number 15 he s been their big play deep threat on the other side of <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> second and 25 it s like you spelled it out even though shed was right with him there is <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">hogan</person> spent the last few years with buffalo so they brought him in i mean you look at their receivers of course what they love to do is go with that double tight end set they got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> and they got bennet and then <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">hogan</person> comes and he s been a nice addition to go with <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> <person player="danny amendola" race="white" position="WR">amendola</person> now commit early rookie out of georgia when <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> came back he didnt know really that much about <person player="chris hogan" race="white" position="WR">chris hogan</person> he had thrown to him so they spent a lot of time after practice before practice trying to get used to them but you could tell just no timing on that one third and 25 and grady to catch he had help over the top <person player="earl thomas" race="nonwhite" position="DB">earl thomas</person> came in and <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> was in the area but he makes the catch here and that s going to be the end of the third quarter to a first and goal from a third and law into three 22 21 sunday night football back after these messages first and goal is we start the fourthquarter al michaels with cris collinsworth and michele tafoya sunday night football patriots seven and one coming in seattle 52 and lonely that five lead changes in this game and on the verge of a six deer he loves being in these kinds of games he s tripped up in the backfield <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> <person player="brandon king" race="nonwhite" position="DB">king</person> slicing in to stop him in his tracks itll be second down and goal let s take a look at how subtle the national football league is watch <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> here he gave <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> just a little tap on his hip and that meant here we go were going deep and then it s <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian edelman</person> with just a little subtle shove at the top into that route to make it work so <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> saw it subtle signs subtle push off subtle big game got by desean shed on that play is second down and goal rady flush down rain he s gonna try to take it in and he slides to a stop at the 5yard line third and goal <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person>s better be glad he didnt hit <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> there with that forearm when he came over the top might have started a riot in here playing had an interception against <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> in the super bowl but wound up getting hurt yeah really really hurt acl broken arm it was really kind of turned that game saying play third and goal <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> under crash shirt down he goes at the 13 yard line <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">frank clark</person> there secondleading sacker comes in to knock him down and theyll have to settle for a field goal attempt what a great play by <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">clark</person> here coming off the edge that s gonna power right through <person player="nate solder" race="white" position="OT">nate solder</person> who s their best offensive lineman and watch he s gonna grab him with his one hand and pull him to the ground he couldnt have had more than three fingers on him yanking that jersey and pulled him straight back seven and a half sacks now for a <person player="frank clark" race="nonwhite" position="DE">clark</person> averell leads the team with nine kosowski now for a 30yard field goal and there is your sixth lead change of the night exactly 13 minutes to go in regulation 24 22 go england so your team has always been good at keeping outside distractions on the outside given the nature of this presidential race so did you find it you find it helpful seo and they need to go players talk to you about this seattle s about any locker room rancor as a result of this we have for seattle s i mean how often have have we seen that he is a master at that and of course he didnt get away with all of that he doesnt have to be a pr guy not with that track record and a good run back here takes it all the way out to the 40yard line you talk about a guy who eliminates all distractions right it doesnt matter what you ask him it doesnt matter what s going on it s his ball club and look 17 years what can you say a lot of people think he may be the greatest coach in the history of the national football hurtin in the conversation yeah no question about that and he maintains a personal life and he keeps it private and no matter what anybody wants to say about it he has an opportunity to do things outside of football and he feels no obligation to answer for that he does have a sense of humor no question about that 37 yard line <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> moved up to the office he got changed in the it s grand picking the ball in the 44 yard line so the pressure was put on a little lob pass and a gain of 19 yards here s one of those naked bootlegs and what makes this interesting is they lead the guy on the end of the line of scrimmage unblocked and in that way you can really sell out on the run play and then it allows your quarterback get out flip it over the top big play for catchers tonight 48 yards for <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">graham</person> <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> gets cut mended by <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> it s always exciting to see new young players come in isnt it i mean <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> against <person player="malcolm butler" race="nonwhite" position="DB">malcolm butler</person> and theyre all going all out but i think were seeing a little bit of how precise is going to be used the one time he was asked to pass protect didnt go so well now theyre just getting him out of the backfield and if pressure is going to come from his guy flip him to ball see what he can do carry 12 times 51 yards over four yards per tote and he s caught five for 42 yards and here is his 18th and around the corner he goes before he is shoved out of bounds lowenstein helping to lead the way and now youve got a third down and six now were getting down to it a little bit and i think for most topend coaches the philosophy at this point is not which player youre going to run it s which player are you going to get it to and on this team typically that is <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> or that is <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> so well see spread it out five why <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> he called the timeout did he get it was the question he called for it the ball was snapped and it will be in 30 seconds they did get the time out close yeah but a wasted time out this early and a half well keep an eye on that it certainly is better than what the possibility could have been there with that snap tonight aerial coverage high above gillette stadium in foxborough being brought to you by geico well if youre a fan of football you love seeing <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> back doing his thing now he likes to get away from the line of scrimmage so he can see the field remember he s not the tallest guy in the world but he has this big rocket arm and he has the ability to get it out so quickly very clean motion 032 that s right up there in the top echelon of all quarterbacks we saw him throw that deep ball on monday night he watched that thing <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> third and six from the 40 and <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> go indeed and the catch is made at the 5yard line <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> setting up a first down and goal <person player="elandon roberts" race="nonwhite" position="LB">roberts</person> was back there the line back he had mccord he coming over over the top 38 yards on a third down and six what a great read first of all by <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> to realize that was man coverage secondly to see this former wide receiver from notre dame lined up on a landed <person player="elandon roberts" race="nonwhite" position="LB">roberts</person> a linebacker on the outside with all that field brilliant all the way around pete carroll loves it from the two <person player="garry gilliam" race="nonwhite" position="OT">gilliam</person> is eligible the tackle the oneyard line second and goal and precise not a big guy so this is going to be a challenge for him just like pass protection down here but i dont think theyre going to put kristin michael in because of the injury that he has and <person player="alex collins" race="UNK" position="RB">alex collins</person> got at one time and fumbled the ball so <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> not quite ready maybe well see him but now it s just gonna fall on <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> to win this game bring in a fullback will cool off ooh so he fronts <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> on a second and goal imagine again <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> theyre waiting were waiting line just comes and head linesman come in third down stop them short well then you cant get better than this right here because youre going to get a kick out here by the fullback and youre just going to get met at the goal line and obviously a bigger back a marshawn lynch for sure is going to score here that <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> being smaller got driven back third and goal and i think carol is going to challenge that well you saw it and we saw it is there a clear enough view to show that he got into the endzone if he loses this challenge without a one timeout i dont think pete wants anymore oh that s a touchdown yeah should be i mean they can always say they blew the whistle like yes it s challenging the ruling on the field that the previous runner was short of the goal line timeout well well well more drama still look at it this thing right now we dont think that it s gonna be overturned because the bowl is clearly over the goal line the question now becomes when is his knee down now they can review this play from all of the different angles they can stitch it together but there s no clarity you see exactly when the knee is down as opposed to the ball the ball is clearly over the goal line so you know that the question is what about the knee if the call stands it s going to be third down the goal theyre gonna lose a timeout to be down to one territories still going over things typically in this situation the league has been standing with the call on the field and the call on the field was he didnt get in here comes territor after review the ruling on the field stands at the half yard line seattle is charged with the second timeout of the half in seattle also has one timeout remaining and one challenge remaining in the game if i had to guess kris i would say that somebody upstairs hit the balls over the goal line that brought forth the challenge flag but he still didnt know when we went down you know one yard between these two teams means a lot these games but a few inches oh my goodness you cant help it flash back a little bit third and goal from about the 11inch line <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> is the running back who s this going to be on its going to move it back to the five it s going to be against seattle at least for the moment or what a great call by matt patricia they do a hard shift with their defensive line and it forced the offensive line to jump it s like a hard count coming out on the goal line great job by patricia there you go and now you see why pete carroll challenged that thing were gonna shift down and as soon as they do that and you saw the flash well start offense fiveyard penalty third down everybody s on pins and needles when youre down there in that goal line situation everybody s low and you know youre just thinking i got drive this guy out here now said you see somebody moving and you move it s just it happens a lot but there is nothing that goes unnoticed with these two coaches there never has been carroll working the sidelines the ball comes back to the five and a half and its third down and goal it comes to the left side the cash is too high so they went from a possible touchdown and a first and goal to a field goal attempt which will still give them the lead main curse is going to come down and try and set a pick and not be caught doing it just turns around and they miss the throw that s the second throw weve seen <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> tonight overthrow in that kind of a situation 23 yard attempt for house go this would be his fourth of the night and their gang is your seventh change for the night seven of 25:24 seahawks next sunday night nation s capital green bay and what s going on theyre losing in today the tennessee four and five were the packers redskins the win today beat minnesota washington pretty much in the <person player="joey hunt" race="white" position="C">hunt</person> in the nfc east the record of five three and one football night gets it started at 7:00 eastern time <person player="paul richardson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">paul</person> <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> longtime owner of the seahawks may allah does not enjoy being in the spotlight or limelight just goes about his work it is fortunate microsoft once a heck of a franchise ill tell you that for the two yardline <person player="cyrus jones" race="nonwhite" position="DB">cyrus jones</person> up the middle and down the sideline hey loses the ball and rolling over at the 43 yard line the patriots are gonna wind up with the football nate abner who went to the olympics in rio playing rugby for the us team is able to come up with a ball and save the day now this got very close here at the end so <person player="steven terrell" race="UNK" position="DB">terrell</person> get that ball out of there so there was a collective deep breath this stadium where i tell you when these two teams get together it s just fun to watch yeah they dont meet all that often but they played a onepoint game in seattle in 2012 a classic super bowl and a game tonight weve had seven lead changes apart from that not a lot of drama not a lot going on linebackers in the game now youve got <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock coyle</person> and it looks like he s in coverage against <person player="martellus bennett" race="nonwhite" position="TE">martellus bennett</person> so no coverage guy out there <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> go to the air if he can grady go and complete <person player="logan ryan" race="nonwhite" position="DB">logan</person> looking around wanting a flag <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> was in the coverage itll be second and ten well the first day of two games had seven more league changes i mean that cowboy steeler game was just phenomenal ezekiel <person player="deandre elliott" race="UNK" position="DB">elliott</person> winning it with the run through the middle at the end cowboys made a major rolling one with eight straight wins lead change here pretty soon second down and ten <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> winds up with the ball now the question is was the play alive this is clearly the type of situation with a look at it and belichick obviously can challenge when they take a look first time i agree <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> i think is the one that got it out of there yep you know that s one of the things great defenses do when they get you corralled they dont necessarily want to take you to the ground they want somebody else to come in there and rip that sucker out of there and there s <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> what a shock that is with the fumble recovery well how about i mean seriously seattle comes in here they play a tough monday night game across the country fly in here no excuses they didnt want to hear about it at all right and just keep making big plays dont have <person player="michael bennett" race="nonwhite" position="DE">michael bennett</person> you know as good as they come on the defensive side of the ball and theyre up by one and they have the ball camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> makes a bit of a difference on this defense doesnt he hmm you came mission bought the 48yard line <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> flings that one into the bench itll be second down to ten this is a time that maybe you want to think about bringing a little pressure if you can get seattle s offensive line in oneonone blocking situations and i know they want to keep them in the pocket and do all that stuff but youve got to challenge some guys like george fan and marc lewinsky and <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine</person> yvette ii some of these young guys you got to see if they can hold up one on one second and ten keep it on the ground and to the 42 yard line goes <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> big workload for him tonight 16 carries and six catches because as <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> as glow in ski and company can stay with the run game and not be forced into those oneonone pass protections they can get some blocks like that third and four under eight minutes to go in the fourth moose ice in the slot right there a lot of 5y tonight they do again taken out of bounds after he picks up the first <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> covering and that moves the sticks with seven and a half to go it s just an ordinary pick play once they see its man coverage going to come down a wall off here and precise just by time go pick up the first down great job there by <person player="jermaine kearse" race="nonwhite" position="WR">jermaine kearse</person> as well dont go in there and hit the guy just make him bounce out around you and get the first down from the 35 in tackles and then he goes down remember he was a question <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> coming into the game had been on the injury for with a hamstring he has been the number one back but the one <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> i think has taken over that role yeah i would say so <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">branch</person> got a clean shot that time on kristen michael who just bounced out of there many times at <person player="ryan allen" race="white" position="P">allen</person> <person player="alan branch" race="nonwhite" position="DT">branch</person> kids that cleanest shot of a running back and he doesnt go to the ground which theyre also going to get <person player="thomas rawls" race="nonwhite" position="RB">thomas rawls</person> back in a week or two and thatll be big the things coming together right now for the seahawks second down and nine merson throws on the run part of the 22 <person player="tyler lockett" race="nonwhite" position="WR">tyler lockett</person> great catch ryan covering in the place stays inbounds first down i mean this is just classic <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> he s going to see the gap to his left sprint through there and then like the second baseman that he is just flip that thing out there it is just a different <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> than what we saw a few weeks ago he is now playing and making the plays that we saw him make at the end of lash out in the second half of last season he was the mvp cam newton was for the whole year second half it was <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> unbelievable if the knights game starts the second half that play is mike lee takes the ball to the 20yard line dean of a couple second down eight you know now were starting to see these linebackers attacking downhill donte <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> now is starting to come hard across the line of scrimmage theyre gonna find out can these guys hold up in oneonone type for texans and believe me <person player="donta hightower" race="UNK" position="LB">hightower</person> is the one guy if youre a running back you do not want to see come screaming at you second the knee sighs blake all had to cool off with a full black cutting across horizontally and the <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">prosise</person> comes back to the left yeah he s he has a pretty natural feel doesnt he it s almost amazing for a guy he started as a safety at notre dame he went on to wide receiver weve seen some of those skills but were also seeing a very patient professional looking running back in here and pete carroll knows just how to use them and he s going to get your breath big guy weve got a lot of work to do seventh time seattle has been in the red zone tonight two touchdowns four field goals big matchup now <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick</person> chong it s turned into a and a big third down 33 four and a half to go <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">wilson</person> throwing in his cart for the touchdown and that s the trick scored in five games and that has three touchdowns night <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> got everybody s attention including doron <person player="duron harmon" race="nonwhite" position="DB">harmon</person> the safety look how far he s leaning over here because <person player="jimmy graham" race="white" position="TE">jimmy graham</person> which leaves the gap right up the middle to throw the touchdown on the other side <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> got the oneonone and they took advantage man have you ever heard 70,000 people quieter than this on this building to the fumble recovery they cash in on the turnover and now interested yeah with a sevenpoint lead in the goals for two whatever i get it i understand this i think it s a pretty good call well see in a minute that s not a good pool <person player="doug baldwin" race="nonwhite" position="WR">doug baldwin</person> so you know what carol is doing here he figures like odin i got a i gave a twopossession lead if i go for one like force bellatrix and there s the fumble <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> recovers seattle leads by 7 another lead change there s an item you will see this one on nbc thursday night football new orleans against carolina from charlotte coverage at 7:30 eastern game at 8:15 thursday night beginning of six straight weeks of thursday night football see like a trained seal i said there was a lead change there actually wasnt there been so many but that s the first time in the game that the team that s had the lead has scored so you still had seven lead changes it s 31 24 we can tell you that something

this vice titans as they move down the field why bennett now 102 receiving yards on seven catches second and two youre just talking about him the rookie out of georgia fourth round pick he gets it out to the 46 yard line and the next snap comes with under four minutes to play you know how the one guy we have not talked about much tonight is <person player="cliff avril" race="nonwhite" position="DE">cliff</person> april who came in as the leading sack or nine sacks three forced fumbles eight sacks in the last five games we have done a pretty nice job on him and maybe a little tip of the cat <person player="marcus cannon" race="nonwhite" position="OG">marcus cannon</person> a guy who i think s playing his best football this season and we kind of mentioned april s name is when he was called for holding yeah on <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> in the end zone five yard line as the catches me there for a short gain <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> makes the catch and <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock</person> coil covers yeah and as for right now theyre happy to sit back in their zone defenses and now they finally sub out after they get only three yards on first down they bring out <person player="brock coyle" race="white" position="LB">brock coyle</person> and they bring in <person player="jeremy lane" race="nonwhite" position="DB">jeremy lane</person> the nickel second and seven little <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">white</person> to the 48 he goes big big play coming right now third and most of five there comes the train right here <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> comes flying down it there oh and then there s no hole now they quickly come up to the line third well finally got a whistle here oh <person player="malcolm mitchell" race="UNK" position="WR">malcolm mitchell</person> jeff oh man you play young guy hey son there he goes im a nineteen 5yard penalty mmmhmm and as soon as that happen he just walked towards the bench hmm there he is out here did the fake motion like a break it s like having your dad mad at you linda call for third and 10 he makes the catch and spins down to the 24 yard line another big huge third down catch by <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">julian</person> a chick on the outside as you saw <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> come down and just hit is that <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> in there and just no chance no call on that play well they have a third and 25 and converted that s a third and ten two minutes set up for another fantastic finish on sunday night football there s the menu for the volkswagen postgame report michelle on the field the stars of the game to be determined mike <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> and mike breaking it down look around the league as well and look ahead to saints panthers thursday packers redskins sunday two minutes in the first and ten through and taking him down for a lost where for would be mcdaniels we go back to the <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> catch on a third and ten biggest non called a game <person player="james white" race="nonwhite" position="RB">james white</person> s going to come down and he s going to pick <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">richard sherman</person> but if he s within one yard of the line of scrimmage which <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> is it is not a foul pick right there i think <person player="richard sherman" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sherman</person> still had his feet within that 1 yard limitation no foul second four they got it right now <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> going makes the catch next to impossible governed by the shan shed first and go stop it watch this play and this is on a corner now what a great throw he works inside and then uses that big body to squeeze shed back out to give himself some room to make this catch up oh my goodness what a play in the biggest moments bill belichick is going to get the football to his best players did appear first taking as much time off the crockers again <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> s gonna try to burrow his way in the england has all of its timeouts he s shy right theyre hand fighting going on with april and a couple of the patriots will be second down and goal and the patriots will take we assume a timeout here the clock stopping starett organ to tell us he has a little conference going on are these two teams just always going to end up on the oneyard line at the end of their game what a game third charge timeout seattle will be a 30second timeout please reset the game clock to 37 seconds 37 on the game clock please that century or so pete took his last timeout here because he with 37 seconds now figures if new england scores he wants to leave at least a little time for them to get the ball back here we go one more time <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> on the outside against the shawn shed works back inside squeezes over the top perfectly thrown and you knew her <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was going even against the corner didnt even matter wasnt a linebacker wasnt a safety put your top cover guys out there im going right after him and i just wonder and i this may sound ridiculous because youre down a touchdown did he do that quarterback sneak there so they had to burn the timeout and milk a little clock and make it a little easier if they do score defensively vince <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> the other way possible see you are second down and goal is nothing yaks are the officials you come in let s see where the ball is and <person player="mark glowinski" race="white" position="OG">mark</person> it outside the goal line you have to decide on your time outs at this point they have all of them yeah and belichick takes it here first charge timeout he s milked enough time so seattle s gonna have next to nothing left if new england gets into the end zone if he didnt get in that was <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam chancellor</person> once again making this play coming around the edge and just grabbing the legs and not letting him cross i think it s a good call watch him watch <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kam</person> chants are coming around the corner and just grabbing those legs and it looked like youre gonna get blunt just flying over the top certainly there was a big enough hole but it was <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> who saved the day good and right we saw in that game against arizona boys seattle just because you get to the goal line doesnt mean youre gonna get it in well they missed <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> while he was done you can see the difference he makes it s third down and goal he got <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> who lined up as the fullback now they split him locked is the running back as brainy sneaking he tries to he loses the ball so he doesnt get any number one it s and recovered the game is in effect over but it looks like <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> winds up with the ball now theyll take a time and that comes down to a fourth down and go 14 seconds one four on the game but one more second back on the clock and watch how soon <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> moves here he s actually on the move and i think it threw off the timing of the snap youve got your center down there trying to survive and snap the ball and get low and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> you could see him move even before the snap started and i just think it through all the timing off of that snap <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is almost automatic or has been through his career in that situation sneaking it in so here we go with a 4th and goal for new england this is your two point play whatever your best two point play is for this game youre gonna see it right now and now he s flag 12 then yep that was the initial indication 12 men defense dont work out to the oneyard line now let s see if the play call changes i know <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> looked like he was going to fly over that mile <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> got him but here they come theyre going to make the shift to the pigs here bring in the fullback james devlin bringing an extra offensive lineman <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">cameron fleming</person> and you probably put everything on <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">legarrette blount</person> here watch out for camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> off the edge <person player="cameron fleming" race="nonwhite" position="OT">fleming</person> is eligible <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> lines up as the fullback becomes devlin now gronk splits out thank you <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> here kinds of action in the end zone they look for a flag they see none change them with a coverage and seattle s gonna win it what a finish there was a lot of contact and no call and youre not going to change any minds at this point let s take a look <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> he knows it s coming gronk knows it s coming i think they got it right yeah there s a who initiated who s pushing who s tackling who s grabbing they both were yeah and i dont think you could you differentiate that one going in on the officials have taken so much grief especially recently they got the pic play right they got the no touchdown right you didnt get in and i think when they got that one right so this game down to the oneyard line goes to seattle assuming rick fumble aim the ball lines up in the end zone you know you can make a case here out just throwing the ball up in the air twice out of bounds not even dealing with this because this is a tight to the goal line hard count for sure here it s tight and also new england has a timeout and we can use its final timeout and see animals going to have to run one more play the only problem with the safety is then you got to turn around and kick it to those guys right but your dad oh you know almost no time on the clock i guess the thought is even if here we go one more time with that i think the thought is what the heck if we do quarterback sneak and they end up getting a safety on us then all right that strategy is okay too second and ten and that s going to make it official so they play a monday night game they have the ball only 20 minutes that defense was out there for 40 so it s a short week come across the country seattle of boston about as far as you can go in the national football league itd be a fun ride home though to get back around five over six in the morning embrace between belichick and carroll they go back a <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> way and how much do you think this game means to pete carroll super bowl one thing yep he was fired by the new england patriots he will never admit it hell never say it but i guarantee it this one feels good first time he s been back in foxboro since nineteen nine <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> to <person player="rob gronkowski" race="UNK" position="TE">gronkowski</person> no flag no touchdown seahawks winning coming up the

here hey you know your coach said coming into this game that in so many ways these teams matched up so well you know what did this one require it was a challenge obviously coming to foxborough a tough tough place to play you know it s not easy to win here they there s ive been in many losses here for four opponents for them but you know it was a battle we played one play at a time the defense stepped up when we needed to right there made some great plays you know the offense we we may make great plays when we really needed to win and we were clutch on third down so when we needed to we battle guys make phenomenal catches how about my guys <person player="cj prosise" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj prosise</person> making plays all the field so many guys made place and im from the

prosise</person> so let s bring him into this conversation congratulations <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell</person> cj your first start and you had to carry quite a low tonight how were you able to step into that role and produce the way you did i mean you know it comes with the position you know it s expectation and a half of me you know they got big expectations for me so you know i want to come in here at a gave me an opportunity i want to make the plays for the offensive line at times seem to take over this game what did they do for you i mean theyre clearing lanes for me you know weve been able in a hard time getting the run game going this week we finally got the lanes open and i was running just hitting the holes and you know it was easy to maim it easy for me yeah pete carroll who used to coach here said this is a great place to play and it s a fun place to win what does this win mean to you guys i mean it s awesome win you know just coming on the road getting a big win you know we had a big hyped up game you know hyped up all week and you know just sunday night it s a big big primetime game for us so we excited to get back to back to centurylink next weekend plenum eagles congratulations cj thank you mike okay michele thank you a lot to talk about this one let s bring in the hall of famer coach <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> dungy very different conversation <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> from one we saw seattle the tie game with arizona just three weeks ago what does this mean for pete carroll s team on the short week cross country and beating the patriots here at foxborough well this really says a lot about their team and how they compete but i think it sends a message to the rest of the nfc seattle is is back they were struggling <person player="russell wilson" race="nonwhite" position="QB">russell wilson</person> looked a lot better today a lot healthier their offensive line which had struggled to open holes in the run game and protect for him they played outstanding today camp <person player="kam chancellor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chancellor</person> coming back so you take those three elements in seattle is a different team right now going into new england and winning this ballgame i think they really message coach we can have a <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> conversation still about the play calling 21 months ago at the end of super bowl xlix the conversation after this one wont last as <person player="chris long" race="white" position="DE">long</person> but certainly can be called into question what do you think of new england s play calling at the end of this game well they may have outsmarted themselves just like seattle outsmarted themselves on the oneyard line at the super bowl but this is really what new england does <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> has been great at the sneak game here you know losing the ball the garrett <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> very close i thought they should have continued to pound with with <person player="legarrette blount" race="nonwhite" position="RB">blount</person> and then on the fourth down play you cant question this this is what they do gronk is their their guy they went to him it didnt work out but you have to give seattle credit for just the way that defense competes theyre on the goal line the impressive stuff <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> thanks so oakland kansas city in new england all the best record in the afc now at 7 and 2 dallas has the best record in the nfl at 8 and 1 and we bring in mike florio from pro football tocom mike not all that surprising but after the game today the great dallas win over pittsburgh jerry jones said dak prescott the starter is there more to the story well there definitely is mike i spoke to stephen jones the ceo and executive vp of the cowboys earlier in the week and he made it clear that once <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> romo is healthy and part of the active roster coach jason garrett an offensive coordinator scott linehan will have the ability to switch to <person player="tony mcdaniel" race="nonwhite" position="DT">tony</person> romo in a given game if they believe that in that given set of circumstances they need the boost that would come from using romo so right now prescott looks great but once were almost healthy and on the active roster prescott may be the starter romo could be the finisher it s going to be up not to jerry jones but jason garrett to make that call every time it seems like there s a referendum on dak prescott it s a resounding yes he can still do it impressive again today thanks mike you can catch mike tomorrow morning on pro football talk live from 7 tonight eastern tampa tight end camera break is the guest that s followed by the dan <person player="patrick chung" race="nonwhite" position="DB">patrick</person> show from 9:00 final score seattle by 7 chris now back to wrap it up in a moment welcome back to the volkswagen golf all track postgame report here now al michaels and cris collinsworth some statistics come with an exclamation point there would be one you go back to 2001 in home games when the patriots have had a lead of any size in the fourth quarter at any time 102 and 2 the 2 is tonight the only other loss of the giants in 2011 wow so we started the night saying this could be a super bowl preview our friends over at fox sports would be dancing in the streets if this was a super bowl preview no question about it and what we saw tonight was professional football i thought on both sides of the ball special teams even the officiating tonight was pretty much dead on this was just one of those games that you can start to see great teams at the end of the year starting to put it together and i think both these teams are starting to find their way philly goes to seattle next weekend the patriots go to san francisco so weve got a couple of games coming your way this week first of all thursday night youve got the panthers in the saints each of those teams had a chance to win each suffered a very disheartening loss and the only good news in that division would be atlanta loss today as well yeah drew brees takes them right down the field and then they get the extra point blocked and here we go the other way to end up losing the game so you know it were at that point in the year as you head towards thanksgiving there are some teams you know both these teams have two game leads and theyre division now all looks good ok were all happy there are other teams like were gonna see on thursday night that are now fighting for their lives right and theyve got to come up with a whimp panthers had a 17 nothing leading loss to casey 22:17 sunday night is green bay at washington washington hot right now theyre rolling a little bit beat minnesota today green bay you tell me you know and i know theyre missing some key people out there but anytime aaron rodgers is on the field you always think youre gonna win football games and i cannot wait to go put on the tape and figure out what s going on with this football thing youll be doing that later tonight wont ya all right week 11 starts on thurs i had lots of action for you on nbc but what again here tonight in foxborough massachusetts as the seattle seahawks come across the country knock up new england 3124 michael s pascale s written so deploy a crooked le jewish stop our
