the 17 yard line the steelers are running football team and the chargers probably half the best office in the entire national football league thus far in the season they also have the weakest defense rated of course by yardage given up a very young team the sargent football team has had 60 players this year as they have struggled and struggled mostly on defense they have great talent on offense defensively that is not the case third down and four second down and four ready economies behind the line of scrimmage windham king in there quickly well i know frank still is going to try to run the

have enough players on the office that guys are looking towards individual accomplishments this year theyre near the top in some statistics defensively they got a young football team so theyre gonna gambling im gonna go all out i would hate to have to play us to like just trying to make it to the playoffs the first down apparently again pinko turn it up around a 7yard line yes he gets into the end zone im spencer hip first near the line of scrimmage broke a tackle carried a couple of steelers all the way into the end zone and the former usfl allstars running from the fullback position he gets hit early well there s nothing fancy about this it looks like what we would call a five drive a straight ahead run and spitzer he just wants it he he s running as if theyre trying to make the play off he ran right through <person player="donnie shell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">donnie shell</person> and <person player="eric williams" race="UNK" position="DB">eric williams</person> for the touchdown san diego with a black punt and now a good effort by spencer takes the early lead but a gap right these two pittsburgh steelers in a game that is so important to these steelers they need seven to nothing and well be back in san diego and customi and that is so important to the steelers we already have a couple of errors in the early going on the opening kickoff <person player="bob thomas" race="white" position="K">bob thomas</person> hit it was mishandled a short kick by in its win today boy let s couldnt find the handle of mine looking at the settle for the football down

jenko handling the kickoff chores for the san diego chargers tonight were holding once again the steelers are having all kinds of problems in the early going let s take a look at the scores around the league the jets thing right there with new england of miami and new england winning of course over detroit and miami and <person player="mike green" race="UNK" position="LB">green</person> bay three

position="WR">louis</person> over new orleans kansas city over atlanta holding against read <person player="fred small" race="UNK" position="LB">small</person> of the pittsburgh steelers first down 10 the steelers at the 21 yard line and well have son these games earlier today the mexico but let me get the screen off and it goes to college well set up screen and caller gets out over the 35 yard line up close to the 40 yard line before he s taken out of bounds by <person player="mike green" race="UNK" position="LB">mike green</person> well set up stream grape na the left offensive tag which is a heck of a job of throwing a block out there the screen set up beautifully you wonder why it works pittsburgh hasnt been successful passing yet why would even happen but san diego s defenseless isnt one of the best in my 35 nice block by pinay up to the 39yard a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> opening over the right side and pounds his way up close on the 45 yard line any of five on that itll be sucking down at five up into their bios woody low san diego defense 28th of last thus far in the season after 13 games 17th against to rush 28th against the past but they have a lot of youngsters playing out of position a lot of footballs through their roster this season 63 to be exactly down to five hollers what the she does like to do they like to control the game they like to move the ball on the ground with the big backs <person player="frank pollard" race="UNK" position="RB">pollard</person> in <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> just short at the first out well when you play against san diego there s two schools of thought one is to run the ball control the ball and keep their highpowered offense off the field and the other one is to try to outscore them consider theyve lost two games this year they sports 35 points in i would think you would have to try to outscore that deal and one and hell have the first down slipping through the left side gets inside here the 29 yard line for the first down and don coryell and i mentioned earlier came here in 78 to finish out the season the first three years that he s in here the chargers won the western division of the afc since then however prepared so well we have not wanted to raise they have two losing seasons and this is the third year that they have not made it to the playoffs about that first and 10 what and <person player="bennie cunningham" race="UNK" position="TE">cunningham</person> down to the 37 yard line the tight ends coming in to tonight more than tips burak sealers had five receptions in 13 games <person player="bennie cunningham" race="UNK" position="TE">cunningham</person> that was in reception i mean i cant help but believe that the emotional side of this game as i usually have the favorite pitcher there in the hunt for the playoffs san diego yeah you know theyre playing loose you know they had a lack of concentration hector playing out this schedule i got to give an edge the picture turn it up peel outstanding linebacker here for the san diego chargers for a decade down into the nightfort sacrament outside position three interceptions he s always around the football he s the kind of player that you hear the cliche all the time he makes things happen that he does so you know i thought a disagree in one sense is that san diego youre looking at a team with so many great individuals guys like joyner and west <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> and of course <person player="lionel james" race="UNK" position="RB">lionel james</person> these guys statistically theyre at the top of the list and they want they want to be at the top well maybe that s the problem it is a football team it s a team game second down to nine <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">woodley</person> dont put off the collar and often <person player="frank pollard" race="UNK" position="RB">pollard</person> slips as he tries to turn up field at the 35 yard line squeezes out a couple itll be third down and seven for david whitley unfortunately for the charges tweener final <person player="lionel james" race="UNK" position="RB">james</person> taylor cannot play defense now expand us the new owner as of last year august 1st 1984 has openly said that he will value when the season is over forget it third down and seven <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">woodley</person> john hindi weve tried to cover john to the 40yard line playing with a very sore calf he had to leave last week s game against denver great year they had last year but he now has sixty four receptions were going to look at it from the reverse angle and youre going to see what we couldnt see with the camera on the other side of the field making a good clean sliding catch and giving the steelers a first down 20yard line of san diego cromby break one tackle just lunges down close to the 15yard line thatll gain of five and itll bring up a second down and five the last couple of years multiple injuries they dont do too well with him out of the lineup dont that s the second time the steelers that pulls their card a mule fluorophores and he just blocked lyndon king placed now in the nest that man can he go already beautiful trap lock over the past couple years all of it playaction wideopen is that the problem the blitz was on somebody should have probably pulled out of it i picked up <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> quite an ingenious play dan <person player="terry lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis</person> lips in motion as if <person player="terry lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis</person> lipless was going to run a reverse big de safeties follows <person player="terry lewis" race="UNK" position="DB">lewis</person> lipsey saw him go across the screen left to right consequently walter is all by himself and woody <person player="woodrow lowe" race="UNK" position="LB">lowe</person> was taking a <person player="terry long" race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> look into that back field he was the line back on that side most certainly would have had the underneath coverage on avatar midi wasnt there the steelers come back there s six on the scoreboard and <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> tides it up balram a firstround pick an 82 a lot of injuries though for the first couple of years theyve been a productive back those past couple years that was his 17th reception of the season his first touchdown the reception is 700 yards rushing <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> to kickoff theyre trying to do something about it there they 27yard to return san diego at the 21yard one were down on the field eric eibar who field of that ball for mary so san diego died put the steelers in the early going well have the first and 10 at the 22 yard line saturday abc s wide world of sports returns for the exciting boxing as american fighters go toetotoe the us amateur boxing championship this event will get seen live except on the west coast at 4:30 eastern at specific 3:30 several time on abc s wide world of sports there you go starting this ride ill uphold on the right side this defensive unit of the steelers 13 games rate at number one in the afc not going to get to raj they were first against the past they are much more conservative defense than they were a year ago this has prompted a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> grumbling in the field city the students that lost their last two games was read over stadium to do that why dont for the corner and joyner getting a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> <person player="terry long" race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> in the tooth bill was able to make the good move get the first down but football out close to the 47 yard line this is the perfect example why the steelers havent been blitzing <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">rick woods</person> the cornerback is playing well he s playing quarters normally a free safety no killers have had to play zone defenses to joyner found a huge hole in the left side of that zone defense of the right side defense inside was wide open again boss im leading receiver more impressive whiners played in a hundred and seventy eight consecutive foot games seventeenth year for <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> first time the <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> train <person player="lionel james" race="UNK" position="RB">lionel james</person> into spoiler territory near the 47 on the gain of five itll be second down and five hit there by brian <person player="bryan hinkle" race="UNK" position="LB">hinkle</person> wood for the students they get frank you know <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">rick woods</person> is normally a free safety <person player="harvey clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">harvey</person> cleat started every game there this season but he has a bad ankle couldnt start last week so the steelers have got to protect <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">rick woods</person> and they do it with his own defense <person player="harvey clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">clayton</person> tried to go <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">rick woods</person> who has worked for safety than he has at corner is in there right corner back out with a finger sucking down a five taken there by one of the fine linebackers all football <person player="mike merriweather" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mike merriweather</person> and hell short of the first sound by about two yards down and two you might wonder what the big problem is with it that still is you say they have some weaknesses in their secondary jill but theyre number one in the afc and defense well when you play conservative deepest you dont come up with the big defensive plays last year a guy like mike meriwether when they blitzed a lot at 15 sec s he only has four sacks this year s takes those big deep into plays that smells victory of course down inside for the 39yard line hit the air by donny shale or it s down san diego and just to elaborate a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> further on what you mentioned oh jay the steelers have not had a flat curious general at home and theyre off to <person player="sam washington" race="UNK" position="DB">washington</person> at all charter that s a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> aggravating 235 steeler fans they like their rough tough football play that way the <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> noll decided to go the conservative group to avoid giving up the big light on first down as dispenser pressure picks up <person player="gary dunn" race="UNK" position="DT">gary dunn</person> will be at the bottom of that be second down spencer was the third leading rusher in the usfl over the past few years 3100 yards you played with me gago arizona and memphis does the charges of the ground draft pick in 83 we already signed with chicago receiver even on the outside like the dojima valley wide open he got behind and <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">woods</person> was going at donny shale as if he thought shale should have been back there covering for him but in any event <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> was wide open he run right by number 22 top words and would started yelling johnny <person player="donnie shell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shell</person> after the playdoh expected shells of free safety to be there to cover for him easy won a gift if you will for the chargers what <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> so the season his a touchdown tonight we could have a lot of points on the scoreboard put the conversion the charges have the lead once again

get a couple of losses from the cleveland browns please been lost today to seattle and they need one loss by cincinnati a team that beat the steelers twice on person 10 would leave back down to <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> if that was the completion and the charges could get the ball back yes they ruled out a completion to have a combi jump in at the bottom of the pile <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> had the football he was pounded topped it up and san diego gets another big turnover watching from the reverse angle youll see it a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> better if we use the tamper from across the field again willie chased out of the

pittsburgh has always been one of your better trapping encounter teams over the years theyve done it from that fullback position with franco doing that counter step in their trap probably more than

<person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> knowledge skids me that it would be 21 14 but theyre playing against a team that is rated last verses the pass and all of football theyre down by 14 points i think i think about throwing the ball a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> more since 1971 the <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> noland had a team at this point in the season under 500 with the sealer third and seven quickly trying to get deep to tweenie who had a big game against denver and a

player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> bit anytime a punted while was the ball hasnt caught him up and defenders are allowed to run into him chargers have it back and that means trouble for the steeler defense but as far as the playoff picture is concerned but they are a very entertaining football team to watch particularly because of this man and his eight starts fans

position="DT">chuck</person> know about that today and if that could possibly defeat a reason for pittsburgh low passing cosette if he didnt think so and he likes his quarterbacks calling the plays they smile also unsaid he does not have a lot of flexibility low enough i believe he was underneath in that very unusual formations yes it is let me put it on the numbers lever touchdown reception for this remarkable young football player from southern mississippi yes 53rd reception of the season he s averaging just under 20 yards gained just returned man number one draft pick of a year ago he got

placed better the balls are perfectly thrown past you see on a slant pattern like this the ball has to get there quickly if it s out in front higher low receiver has a tough time catching it because it s all hands he put it right on the numbers i know jay made a good point that receiver knows he s going to get hit too in that area so putting it on two numbers is the right spot to throw the football when were seeing more and more this almost pick action you saw the john followers provide us the shade of a pick there open him up first down san diego theyre at their own 17 yard line taken

making more mental there s a lack of concentration but it looks like distillers are making the mental errors tonight and there s no question that that had to be his own coverage on the part at least john wayne johnny <person player="donnie shell" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shell</person> was just very slow getting there that had to be some kind of zone coverage either that or <person player="john swain" race="nonwhite" position="DB">swain</person> is really on the wrong chapter not for <person player="terry long" race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> pace with jaylin <person

out of the playoffs the steelers in a desperate battle to stay in the playoffs look at the zone coverage now is shaping up his own coverage otherwise you would have john wayne right up there tight on

getting to the outside and the top of your screen and it s all over <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> with blazing speed but donny shale does not have much speed didnt have it when he arrived on the scene many years ago he s made the most out of a the ability that he has been at the pro bowl many times that he did no chance with jam i agree duck though they have a walter weapon well gingka will kick off for san diego as the charge of receivers get together on the sidelines joyner appears to be okay they have been looking at him a few moments ago spencer s back in the wheel itll go back steelers short kick byebye jenko 27 yard line he had to be superman nassif three or four weeks ago the chargers defeated the raiders and overtime and it looked like they had everything in front of them with the denver lost in overtime and it s been kind of downhill ever since then there s <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite"

looked for <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> life comes in late a lot of times chipped off when jailer was not open and theyre between er turning on tv the offensive coordinator really has provided a buried attack for the target mr <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> go downfield and hell simply run an end pattern <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">david little</person> the line back is the man that falls down in the middle years he cant quite get to the pass his cover theyre working in the middle you saw the face map looked as though <person player="rick woods" race="UNK" position="DB">rick woods</person> got the hand in there there s a first down goal to go we will not get to play off the clock was started and were at the twominute warning san diego leading 28 to 17 over the pittsburgh school back in san diego the chargers put some more points on the scoreboard they have a first down and goal to go is a three yard line and dr al has already watched his league leading offense roll up 246 yards the first half is not over pittsburgh of course ended tonight was the number one defense in the afc this is <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> prince to the outside touchdown san diego beauford <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> in his second year out of mississippi eleventh round draft pick and again good blocking out in front somebody was supposed to come up building you look even your cornerback or your outside linebackers job is to come up field and force the runner to run inside and no one got there <person player="jim leonard" race="white" position="C">jim leonard</person> got there as a pulling right guard for san diego he made a good block on the force man turned him inside and <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> took it outside now it s for the conversion okay this handle there the putter mizenko is also the holder snapper devi s put night there is logic oh now the conversion attempt is no good the chargers lead to stevens 3417 know many of you fans today were watching the raiders in the broncos the freighters one once again and overtime but themselves a great shape in the afc western division of look at again the ball was snapped well by <person player="dennis mcknight" race="white" position="OG">mcknight</person> pochenko just bobbling getting it down <person player="bob thomas" race="white" position="K">thomas</person> it a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> twostep there knowing you could kick it to <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> place down not a snowball in sight either abby why did he drop it san diego chargers make shambles thus far the steelers defense in the league conference leading defense coming into the night they have blown obviously blown a couple of key coverages on touchdown passes a couple of cells where the quarterback and even though they have had to go tonight without <person player="harvey clayton" race="UNK" position="DB">harvey</person> plate have been glaring errors declaring airs with the blowing coverages they had to fumble down here a good defensive play by the linebacker from san diego in the kicking game and government they feel they have to win louie let s just handles out of the end zone although i think you could have stayed in there is any event picked out yes ill bring the touch back in the ball out to the 20yard line steelers have three timeouts well you wouldnt say so a year ago they were just about the same positions and they went on as i mentioned earlier too when the division agp timber in the playoff and all over they lost to miami in the afc championship game after nine and seven record the next few games i thought they would be this for the 21 yard line again one second tick on local here at jack murphy stadium and we have the hurryup offense the twominute off it whatever you want to call it no huddle that they play called in the huddle with me move my shower down the sidelines and get that about popping the clock with 127 hours we cannot found by jeff taylor key out of lsu at the 40yard line and that will give <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> noll and his quarterback david would be a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> breathing room john s having a good year not a great year he has over 60 receptions his average per catch is a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> more than it has been in the past this year he s down around 12 yards he s running a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> buttonhook there and being the competitor that he is they didnt go down he got as much as he could and got out of bounds first down steelers their own 40yard line quickly fastest hours and he s upended at the 46yard line theyre still doing the use of their time out and they have three of them theyve all the two plays are not ticking away here in the first half like the points on the floorboard before they go in let me holy the other tight end cut down by the field going to work against san diego that s lag but it goes down to that position usually indicates holding illegal use of hands from the part of san diego here is geoffrey <person player="jerry doerger" race="UNK" position="C">jerry</person> stephen kelly we use a hand to the faith number 63 he family declined her sam that could not be because he is an offensive guard somebody with the three it could be <person player="earl wilson" race="UNK" position="DE">earl wilson</person> that penalty sometimes is reminiscent of bill head slap used to be the defensive lineman were allowed to slap the offensive lineman in the head but said another first down for the sailor and they have 56 seconds remaining in the first half tried to get at the <person player="calvin sweeney" race="UNK" position="WR">calvin</person> sweetie and it s incomplete patty <person player="danny walters" race="UNK" position="DB">walters</person> allows an insertion back there covering for san diego but <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">woodley</person> certainly put the ball on the money that time kelvin just lost his footing quite get a handle on the ball again lots of highlights coming your way theyll be going to new york at halftime joining jim lampley raiders big winners today the denver he s about to tenha for the left of the seidenberg dadda let the win over cleveland today went to eight and six right here the steelers tried to win and stay alive crashing to the 25yard line they will market near the 24 this time <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">david woodley</person> will use a timeout bringing the steelers down to two and there is <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> noll in his 17th year and around these just about everything i mentioned earlier this is the latest in the season since 1971 the <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> noll has been coaching a team that s been under 500 that goes back to his first year first year after coaching right here in san diego starting his career under 50 oldman played for paul <person player="chris brown" race="UNK" position="DB">brown</person> athelas weight under don shula all the basics when he came to the steelers in 1969 he was one and 13 that s it and even all super bowls a year like this side of here doesnt like the glare of publicity he likes to teach turn over to personnel via that he has had a lot of opportunity to teach asked him in the meeting today wise coaching the office to helping coach the office is the busy these offense undies to work when we have no gas lynden kings came from the outside line back in position no one touch the billy ray smith also came they were right in woody s face fourth down well see <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> who is 16 consecutive field goals now he is 27 to 35 having a great year those consecutive field goals in nfl history is 23 second best is barayev premium yep 20 that are perfect once again try a 42yard 41yard field goal by <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> though the steelers get something out of it they trail by two touchdowns however the chargers have exploded off physically tonight you know trailing by two touchdowns after the way theyve been playing this half isnt all that bad theyre still in this game they just have to cut out the mental mistake but you get im surprised that theyre making it s either do or die for the steelers tonight you should really be going after this team concentrate on the job that s allowing up a lot well they wouldnt actually be totally dead if they with the six and eight after tonight but they would be an awful lot of help from an awful lot of people mathematically 11 i think fascinating that here we are was exceptional this game this whatsoever there s only one team who 14 weeks to play that is motivation that supports the chicago bears they quit a <person player="terry long" race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> time ago about the middle of a season or would seem that way but all the other divisions are still open thirtysix seconds remaining in the first half and i dont think you think onside kick against the san diego chargers and left their office to get it back on the field again one shot they could put seven four points up there along the ground i think of <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> the other <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> on the bill this covers it at the 20yard line the second time <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> kicked the ball like that i think he s aiming at those frontline guys and he s trying to kick line drives and hope that they wont bounce off one of those guys sort of a modified onside kick san diego first and 10 31 seconds remaining here in the first half they have a commanding lead 34 20 dodgers have three timeout don coryell in want to do with their remaining seconds here in the first half oh after the 28 yard line and now the charges well take a timeout unusual to run the ball on first down and then call a timeout i dont know why they do that personally i think it want to be throwing the football down field at this porous defense at the pittsburgh very exhibiting tonight they have time to get some more points on the board he had three timeouts now he has two and theyre not noted for their rushing offense jack murphy stadium san diego chargers the pittsburgh steelers the chargers out of it for the third consecutive year out of the playoffs under head coach don coryell he s under fire here by owner alex panos who i would say under fire because malice is that nothing other than he is going to evaluate the coryell situation after the season is over but miss berg steelers definitely what this football game tonight they could move into a tie with cincinnati cleveland at the afc central division and they would be right in it two more games remaining to be played but they have played sloppy football here in the first half that they are clearly 34 to 20 normally you have teams spar in the first half and score points in the second half and these teams have already scored 54 points second down and three no taken out of bounds is west ambler they are calling it good i was ending he marked his foot on the 40yard line and then gave us the wave off it would indicate that it was caught out

the playoffs so far today only new orleans and houston have been eliminated although at the moment of course it looks pretty tough for pittsburgh quickly let s take a look at what happened in the afc where the league s tightest divisional race exists in the afc east the new york jets played in lonely rich stadium in buffalo and <person player="ken dallafior" race="UNK" position="OG">ken</person> obrien had another brilliant day as the jets bounced back from the thanksgiving day loss to detroit to move to ten and four on the season obrien with three touchdown passes this was the first one for 20 yards to mickey schuler with the jets on top seven nothing in the second quarter and then the bomb in the second quarter still obrien wesley walker for a 96yard touchdown pass the longest such path in new york jet history it was 14 nothing at that point the bremen mcneil returned to action carried the ball 27 times but this was johnny hector who scored late in the second quarter from 12 yards out to make it 21 nothing jets and they moved to tanning for staying in the threeway tie atop the division along with the miami dolphins who traveled to <person player="mike green" race="UNK" position="LB">green</person> bay played in twenty five degree weather werent bothered by it at first as they charged to a twenty to three lead but then the pack came back the dolphins leading 20 to 10

tony eason gave the patriots a 7 nothing first school to lead with this 16 yard touchdown run the patriot defense dominated lions who did not allow a touchdown in the game in the second quarter

recovered the fumble for la on the denver nine and tom flores took no chances as on the next play barr kicked the gamewinner from 26 yards out that puts the raiders in the driver s seat in the afc west here is the afc playoff picture something has to give among the three eastern division teams at the top of the list the raiders are the most security in the division cincinnati and cleveland both at 77 but cincinnati has a better record in the division and for the moment denver and seattle are outsiders with playoff shots remain it s already thrown three touchdown passes against the pittsburgh

difficult thing the steelers have to do right now that s defend against the back is on the right it s over there well theyre right im talking about the deep end well with the problems that theyre having on their offensive line joe i think that s one of the reasons he made me run it over robyn coalesce in their coal has been pressuring bouts all night with the blitz that time he got it and that is the steelers first sack in three games and their 31st of the season they did it with a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> gu right up the middle offensive

remaining in the football game we are tied at 41 you gotta love this cry because they keep chanting defense defense to the worst defense in the nfl p 13 games as you look at john wayne second down and six all weve got for david witness a placemark alone after the eighth game as they partially dislocated pick towel they the most out of a great block by juice silken and he takes it down to the 37 yard line for steeler first down never see the stream pass a quick screen defense so poorly first reception frank at six weeks today here well he has seven tonight as the first pass he s caught

this guy but he s a hard runner he gives it everything he has and he did on that plate gets up hell in a hurry be glad to get outside hit by woody low gets three out of it itll be second down and seven for the steelers there are big packs techno playing possession football this year the only thing that s not terribly predictable about the steelers season has been exceptional play of 1lu inept great physical skill second check bobby good heart running and he s close to another first down down near the 27 yard line guilford there defensively were san diego tell you when you play against this stiller team your linebackers and defensive ends they have to go in the whirlpool when the game is over because i dont think any team has ever run so many traps they all they do is tap all day <person player="terry long" race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> and it s a physical game when you play the steelers offensively turnover the interception by <person player="john swain" race="nonwhite" position="DB">swain</person> was the fifth turnover this football game and all for the previous turnovers have resulted in touchdown there for the yard would be over the top of the sneak and he has the first down pittsburgh s putting together a terrific drive here not only are they moving the ball but theyre keeping the fall away from the san diego offense whether he s one of the better game he s ever had last week against denver he was back for 283 yards the exact number that he has up there right now content almost back into the hands of widney itll be sucking down to ten with a big <person player="lee williams" race="nonwhite" position="DE">lee williams</person> sick sick that s the big hands up their battle to the way we want to remind you immediately after this game at sea west by one game that the 49ers very position charged with her own faith ram struggling second in ten victor spencer for another steeler first down at the 15 yard line before he s dropped by john hindi did a good job he found a hole but he made a real nice move of getting the feel right away shaken up have to get off the field but he s a kid that they thought was gonna be the heir apparent for that tailback position at usc after marcus left and move people pull back the tailback he had a decent year but brought in a new coaching tried to change the offense a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> bit get the size throwing the ball a <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> more than running the ball and poor <person player="todd spencer" race="UNK" position="RB">todd</person> didnt get to play too much first down again trying to get us to the fix item <person player="bennie cunningham" race="UNK" position="TE">cunningham</person> would attracted a crowd enzo three chargers whitley picked out the right receiver obviously they were sticking all over <person player="bennie cunningham" race="UNK" position="TE">cunningham</person> i couldnt believe he threw that fast he s gonna have three in the fourth defender on the way ten against the wow did i draw a crowd second down and ten that gravity that rushing specialist comes in for number 90 for your screen in here lana out of miami afford he s a good pass button knocking again dokin avatar korra my <person player="mike green" race="UNK" position="LB">green</person> was out there he got help from <person player="danny walters" race="UNK" position="DB">danny walters</person> and <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> will lose the yard itll be blurred down at 11:00 here s offense tonight i think much of it predicated with their passing to <person player="walter abercrombie" race="UNK" position="RB">abercrombie</person> has hollered on the fact that unable to so tonight is rich ehrenburg he s totally out of action night after going through the past three weeks or so with a pulled hamstring he s unable to play tonight and stop too quickly we are seeing a lot of pasty dab economy well they got squeegee <person player="weegie thompson" race="UNK" position="WR">thompson</person> lined up to the left at the top just feet of course yz6 it he s the only man three receivers on the other side which he dont feel you flag is down a zip is inside the ten whenever a canary diamond that s a tough one options will be spelled out to the defensive captain nobody wants to be captain the hug sir it s too confusing this hey i dont want to talk to you talk to one of the smart guys an offensive player belly race nipple listen to it maybe well look over to don coryell well get on the headset hell phone the governor well get it worked out we got of the chicken the sidelines now what do i do coach should i take it a that first of all that first of all pass interference number 86 offense penalty declined horse down giltia path in ferrets and i think san diego just wanted to force them to take the field goal other than have an opportunity in a third 15 it would have been served down at 21 not too strange the brain all i think chipchop door henderson now is 18 great he has get 18 consecutive hell go 29 of 37 having a marvelous year the lead for the first time tonight they trailed by as much as 14 points early in the game liv struggled a month together they pulled it together in the third quarter theyve been a different football team have not made the mistakes they made in the first half here in the second half but they lead 44 41 we have 637 remaining to be played from san diego <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> to kick off the charge <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> of the 40 and <person player="lionel james" race="UNK" position="RB">lionel james</person> number 26 and the <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> one out to the 45 yard line will be first again for diego arian what a marvelous year this sixty live points in his last five game ive already told you is 18 of 18 the nfl record for consecutive field goals held by martinez via 23 second best ever with gary a premium he had 20 pretty funny oh britain s in san diego tonight i realized have to hurry that for all kinds of pressure as the steelers brought <person player="bryan hinkle" race="UNK" position="LB">hinkle</person> they brought meriwether and bowser slow getting up now as 47 300 yard games of nfl i included in those 47 300yard game six with 300 yard game six for into the arcade second down again then wenzhou it s maybe four out of that before he s taken from behind by <person player="darrell nelson" race="UNK" position="TE">darrell</person> dennehy firstround draft pick out of wisconsin in spire the comeback of <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> but i think before we really see the <person player="kellen winslow" race="nonwhite" position="TE">kellen winslow</person> we knew a year ago when he went down in october and has that reconstruction job on his knee i think it s going to be probably sometime next year admiring for being out there there s a tough year to pull it all back together again then he finds <person player="lionel james" race="UNK" position="RB">lionel james</person> he dipped by donny shale but he has pushed down the already got believe i dont believe that bar and then i mark it up over the 35 yard line and itll be first down san diego a huge oina slake this game is seesaw back and forth there was a point in the first half with the steelers were down by 14 they made a lot of mistakes in the early going it correct is all about a half time they wore it back out but they still holding on to preparing a threepoint lead griner this man is amazing the 29yard line he s in his 17th year he s running around out there like a kid and this is 178 consecutive game he played started out of houston he went to cincinnati and he s done most with the damage right here in san diego and on the cliffs was given time to get it off areas wide open look for the block then it gets it down the sidelines and they knew just how far to go how far to stretch it before he steps out of bounds and he picked up the first town up a 29 yard line of the steelers six receptive for <person player="charlie joiner" race="nonwhite" position="WR">joiner</person> tonight another 100 yard game for me captivity not only is the alltime leading receiver but he s only 250 yards behind regarding for flitz the pair of defenders he picks up seven one thing you got it like about <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> when he sees that there s very <person player="david little" race="UNK" position="LB">little</person> chance of him getting away he will accelerate and get as much out of it as in the back ive ever seen ive been on a play like that he ended up picking up three yards that most beck s would have tried to a lead one of the defenders and the jackals not going forward desert with a move to oj characteristic of the play of mark and oliver tony garcetti gets down very low and right samer cameras inside the 10 to the 8 yard line it will be first down goal to go what a beautiful catch a beautiful pass the beautiful pattern channa is going to run a slant pattern now hell break to his left and reverse pivot and go back to the sidelines beautiful pattern or wealth or ball or as we looked out you saw the master shot it is so typical of san diego every receiver under offensive coordinator ernie zambezi s office is a live receiver and dampe plays those receivers like a piano you never see one more friend ever im gonna kick off soon <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> he s to the 5yard line we suck it down goal to go <person player="trumaine johnson" race="UNK" position="WR">johnson</person> we have to play with the face by john wayne where you wonder if they would be questionable for them to score early the ball back over to the sealer now yeah when they come out i would hate to have to play defense against this ad they go to you dont know who to concentrate on what cooper <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> he s full of very first hurt <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> these brawls down close to the three yard line let s a play that <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mcgee</person> ward on earlier goc gary aniston trailing behind him honestly i assume he as he acted the pitch far keep the ball for the pittsburgh steelers is the seconds ticking away they could be looking at the second be mathematically dead if they live but they will be a deep problem dan found running out of time he only had four seconds on his 30second clock so he did not once the fiveyard penalty he uses a timeout well be back 40 miners before first place in the nfc west drive at 9:00 eastern tomorrow at 49 our defense has been playing great it s going to be quite a test for the rams tomorrow night well be bringing you all the action from san francisco in a while weve got a lot of it right here neely is leading the charge of 44 41 we have 238 remaining in the game a third down goal to go for the chargers theyre inside the three yard line oh it was the jeans <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">anderson</person> touchdown and the seals go back out on top can come back and put a touchdown on floorboard we will have exceeded both points that have ever been scored on monday night football let s watch it again it s been effective already tonight for a touchdown it has worked in previous games for two touchdown that s the old option play instead of the quarterback handling the ball this <person player="buford mcgee" race="nonwhite" position="RB">buford mcgee</person> for the conversion trying to miss another conversion mojiko the ball he had a problem flag is down however they had a fat snap earlier actually was the fat snap as a bad hole by mischenko and they missed an extra point that was haunting him throughout the game here s referee <person player="jerry doerger" race="UNK" position="C">jerry</person> cena holding number 80 family declined rizzoli that sets up the possibility of a tying field goal by the steelers and they have as we have said all night the hottest field goal kicker in football today <person player="gary anderson" race="white" position="RB">gary anderson</person> who is the alltime leader and percentage of active players that s twice the gecko has slowness the snap was good no question about that denis makai doesnt enter ridiculous just didnt get it down i could be overtime watch the raiders in denver play a super overtime game today im told that s the first time two teams have played two overtime games against one another why stay plague plague been on overtime hey what i want to know is why but twas pacheco the holder why wouldnt they have the backup quarterback mark hermit holds the football obviously he had better hands anyway dont do it next week esp is only gonna swap holders next week i cant understand why they would not have theyll be able to hold hard hereford holds the football in that last cage but he did fumble and he got up to run leave herman had he done it had a chance to throw the ball the king goes good he passed the ball he tripped and fell but shaco the kickoff fitzer headless time you see the other kicker other than the butter as the holder because they have an opportunity to work during the practice session out of the 22 the 23 yard line it is a perceived unikom breaching onto the field headed by senator <person player="mike webster" race="white"

race="UNK" position="OG">long</person> way to a lot of crime is picked off by jeff gail oh so record for point three years ago why she can breathe ninetyseven that night san diego defense with an abandoned van and always come back with the turnover with the big play monday night football records the monday night football record for boycott at hannover ninetyseven point piper game <person player="bob thomas" race="white" position="K">thomas</person> swift the upright right airport two minutes and nine seconds remaining where all the 40 thrones though poorly thrown the coverage was there id just get trying to get too much too soon for out so david taught his receiver would do something that he didnt do maybe fetty was going to break underneath the poorly thrown ball football record with me by the to cut down most points scored by a key goke the record of 15 barbies now at 54 up there have to lose a game in his coal 44 is it oh boy especially pittsburgh look at san diego theyve been asking gave lectures but pittsburgh for over a year i wonder what mean joe greene and elsa greenwood and mel clutton the fellas that think it s today look it up there jack lambert arent even giving up 54 number one team in the am tigers are all to drop inside the 15 gary nelson upgrade down there for the target and the twominute warning is sounded ill put them on their feet they played wrong you just got around to joining us that adidas but tonight he s been a wild football game and to the steelers even though they are not mathematically eliminated from the race to me afc simple division me not even thinking in terms of wildcard as they in all probability are going to go six and eight even though the waiting to happen tonight we could see some or stealer points on the scoreboard but it has been wild plus <person player="wes chandler" race="nonwhite" position="WR">chandler</person> five receptions of his 54 yards two touchdowns the band mouse most points up has ever been poured against the steelers by the <person player="mike green" race="UNK" position="LB">green</person> bay packers back in 1941 let it remain to be play keeler s from the 15yard line bauer s incomplete charges really fired up they have been so malign sickly their defensive unit totally the defensive unit there s no question about their office number one in the nfl as it has been for the past three or four years but the defensive unit the bottom of the league into the night yep <person player="jeffery dale" race="UNK" position="DB">dale</person> the interception of <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">woodley</person> and the return 2:44 looking down at him back off again a violent collision this is done hindi he takes it back inside the 10 and saw worth is very slow and very rocky getting up follow this back down two interceptions a week ago one he returned 75 yards for touchdown against buffalo just give them back through the 9 yard line the concern now at the john sawers he got to his feet you seem to collapse this is what s really tough on a defender on a receiver to the defender wasnt even going for the fall he s just intended to separate john from the fall had to fall gotten there but it never did well that s an awful lick for john to have to take we really did take a shot <person player="david woodley" race="white" position="QB">woodley</person> rifles it in there way over the offsets arm our getting the hit i believe in the jeff <person player="jeffery dale" race="UNK" position="DB">dale</person> evade the conduct a good return by john hindi sour appears to be alright walking off unassisted then diego has it back first down goal to go powers in the 12 years alltime leading receiver for this deal over 450 receptions leader in yardley i wonder how san diego s gonna play that s not do you think that dare trying to throw the football at all right they cant do much uhoh they could run if they have to try just run a 10point lead right now ill pitch wicked do is call a coupla timeout one timeout is what they have left i hope they dont throw the football brina to the one maybe they better throw up hey when you can run that good keep it on the ground more often don coryell he s been under fire the owner alex he will review the situation after the season is over for <person player="chuck ehin" race="UNK" position="DT">chuck</person> no it s a very bitter defeat this game will go to six and eight all again itll be third to have a goal to go if i was san diego i think id petition the commissioner trying to get into the central division two years in a row they could beat everybody except the teams in their in their conference thatd be good san diego in the central division that s better than baltimore colts at one time he nfl were in the western individual of the nfl cleveland <person player="chris brown" race="UNK" position="DB">brown</person> john gorgan sighs easily shut sound off the jim spencer <person player="tim spencer" race="UNK" position="RB">tim</person> fitzer appears to be held out of the end zone and the charges can left the final seconds tick off now there

the other four men on the roster that they took off this year sixteen seconds remaining in the game this would be if this team to see if he falls on the ball but they try to sleep now to give it to
