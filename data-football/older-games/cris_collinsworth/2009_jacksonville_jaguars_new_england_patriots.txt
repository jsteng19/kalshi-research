drive in the game for the new england patriots <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> will be low and here you take a look at big tournaments in the two times the first down it s to stop that is a gain of nine dan conley the draw at left side was leading the way they go at heavy personnel and watch the block to kick out on quick and close and that s where the field is and of course you get an alley where theyre able to extend for the first down expect the pages to come out throwing the football i know we have bad weather this isnt bad weather when it comes to throwing the ball for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> back to five of the secondary it is first and this is <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> folk there s a nice block by the wide receiver <person player="sam aiken" race="nonwhite" position="WR">aiken</person> a 47 yard line he was run down on the play by enemies with an 18 yard run after a time here at first down run by <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> you have to be able to make the unblocked defender myth and this is exactly what happened to the rookie cox 21 he was unblocked should have made the tackle on <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> falls but falk has been doing this for a number of years look at him make the unblocked defender myth that s where extra yards are to be gained at the second level of the defense poor in the secondary and its first intent baroni is back in wide receivers out there i did the motion that is big yes jen one of the officials after a six yard pickup 41 yard line they wanted crisp they wanted to dictate the tempo for tune in on his first possession and theyre doing it with a good mix of running past so far five plays on this drive three of them have been run played that s a surprise to me i know it s a suprise to jack del rio to take a look at bill belichick going to against maybe what the opponent is thinking that theyre going to see jackie o reals that we expect them to come into this game spread us out and throw the ball with calm breeze every week you and i talk about an office capturing that rhythm in their temple early in the game absolutely i think it needed for the quarterback to get going 111 im down by cox the rookie quarterback 15 yard pickup so on this drive nine yard run by <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> <person player="junior seau" race="nonwhite" position="LB">junior</person> run by vulcan 15 right there to waive the linebacker see how theyre close to the line of scrimmage the play fake causes them to step up to the line of scrimmage creating room on the second level for <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> see those linebackers have to get deeper in their coverage to try to help underneath <person player="derek cox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">derek cox</person> the corner was matched up in mantoman coverage <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> will eat you alive over the middle of the field if you dont get help from your line back here each defense as well of us oh absolutely southern play the drive it started back at the 17 yard line this is <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> palmer was leading in bring him down another 9yard run alexander brings him down to the bottom yeah 17 years lost number 21 <person player="gary guyton" race="nonwhite" position="LB">gary</person> coxe he he the unblocked defender they expect their corners to be able to make these kinds of tackles and when you missed saw the result almost always into a first down for the other team or at least a huge gain an eightyard run on that plane you can see ringlets moving the ball downfield distant run and have secreted <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> connelly was in the backfield this is <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> on second down and one connelly plays guard is down to the 15yard line picking up two on the play and then a host on there including a <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">henderson</person> and <person player="terrance knighton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">terrance knighton</person> so running the ball better and you know they talk to the papers this week in the profit area about how the tight ends have gotten in there in terms of run blocking for this patriot office <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">benjamin watson</person> <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">chris baker</person> our big guys and should not only cast the ball down the field i think theyre versatile players and that s what bill belichick want not just tied in to catch it but you got to be able to run in terms of your ability to run the football none of those tight end walks into motion right now with this versed in denver pit the peroneus and he s down to the oneyard line nice catch and run by ben <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> 26th reception of his season 14 yard pick up first and goal for the delinquent patriot bin laden we told you the run blocking but now he gets to catch the ball you do the dirty work and now you get to have fun and if he elevates the big guy might go in for a touchdown so he does the dirty work versatile players are the guys who catches the eye of bill belichick he s always had versatile players so handsome absolutely got to be able to do more than just one thing and nowadays knocking on the door of the goal line let s see when most teams expect the run they usually go to play space to decide it before is in as a tackle eligible on the west side to go to first in goa mrs maloney and no signal yet from the official did he get in nope thank the jaguars think the ball was loosened and there goes the linebackers smith who s going to go all the way was a fumble on the one yard line by moroni now he is bundled four times this season he has lost all four including that one right there that is a huge turnover for bill belichick patron as a running game had been working for this game here s the announcement that s what were going to get into your fist and now theyre going to say it jaguar ball there s no dispute at this point take a look at it <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> how s it right in there of course the math about there is the ball down there on the ground you did come out and hit the ground while he was still on his feet well no one has more red zone takeaways and no one has more first drive takeaways than the jacksonville defense six of them this year <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> fumbles on the one jaguars with a huge break early and while we were away bill belichick dropped the red flag to challenge the call that it was a fumble and maybe even hit the goal line which would mean a touchdown so were going to see if we can see anything at all or you cant see the ball come out it s going to fall at the feet of the many defenders huddled around that goal line area the ball drops right on the goal line if the ball comes right out and hits the goal line you got to ask yourself as we saw it right there okay you got to ask yourself is that a touchdown hey did he break see there was a ball dale you got to say well he did break the plane of the goal line but right now theyre just reviewing as to whether or not it was a foam that s a tough one it was inconclusive as to where he was but your point is very well taken it was dropped straight down ball came state straight down and landed on the goal line which mean he did break the plane of the goal line you have to wonder if they might rule it a touchdown with the ball coming out in that position nonetheless it was a very impressive first drive by the new england patriots they a couple of 9 yard runs by <person player="laurence maroney" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maroney</person> and 18 yard run by <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">faulk</person> a 15 yard catch by <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> and a 14 yard catch and run by the tight end <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> was four of four on that drive he looked very crisp and he said earlier on that he felt that he had you talked to him last night on the phone he felt that he had about his good week of practice as he is in office and he started this game going for four for throwing the ball as we showed you the play again see the ball hit right there now we know it did come out i want to be able to show you right where the ball drops right on the goal line which i got to believe that he broke the plane of the goal line but the officials their view they cant see them yes and see and i think unless it s indisputable theyre going to keep it as jacksonville s ball that would be my guess theyve made the ruling theyve seen it here s the call after reviews ruling on the field stands it was in conclusion of 14 and have one solid remain it but i think zeller if you got dockable this officiating crew in a room they would say circumstantial evidence would say that it dropped but we could not see the body nor the ball and if it did cross up higher in the place you couldnt see him penetrate the goal line with the ball in his possession they just saw the ball come out and so it would call the fumbled on the field for they i felt old appalled on the field they had no evidence conclusive enough to overturn so moroni with his fourth bumble and look where quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard is marooned at his one if jones drew in the backfield quarterback heating quarterbacks in the nfl strong as you can see him follow the block he s brought down by <person player="ron brace" race="nonwhite" position="DT">ron brace</person> after a gain of four and he s up to the five yard line quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage solomon has been hit more than any other quarterback this season in the national football league he s a big guy he can take it but today more than anything he s got to put up a lot of points i think the that s the presumption you know youre going to get some <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> couple rookie tackles including evan <person player="eben britton" race="white" position="OT">britton</person> who has been the better of the two and <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> is the third leading rusher coming into today in the national football league it is second down and six from the body <person player="jordan black" race="white" position="OT">jordan</person> blank is an extra offensive lineman on the right side he just goes right to the pile chile s <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> is right there and limiting him to a gain of four it s up to about the eight yard line on the play defensive lineman mike right through the praise from coach bill belichick this past week for his work in the buffalo win he replaces the injured timeworn who will play but wont start rod <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> just made that tackle he s made a lot of them he leads the patriots and tackles this year as he did a season ago and <person player="shawn springs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shawn springs</person> was inactive for five games started last week against buffalo starts again today here s a third down into jump through when to the point the foot gentleman takes it inside mayor once again was in there he s up to about the 12 yard line picks up two on the play and hell be close to a first down so hard to grab on to he s 5 7 and they had some areas a first down right there they had some extra cackling practice this week in the new england practice half bill belichick said we did take some extra tackling drills simply because <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> such a difficult i the tackle he doesnt give you a usual body doesnt give you a large space to wrap up and anything strong and powerful in the lair body they even create lancome is coming as a fullback memento said on our first item 10 to the 12 jones crew is terrific lot going with the block and see the pile and gaytan was among the other life looked like the bomb amp in charts li but i think he held on it was a gain of 14 yards he moved gaytan at the bottom of the pile and theyre going to spot in at the 20 foot how to be move a pile being that small the problem is now watch the defender theyre all trying to rake the ball out see theyre trying to get the ball out instead of making the tackle so while youre clawing and raking for the ball he s still churning his legs we talked about the powerful lower body and so that s what you have to wrap up it s like being in the rodeo if you can get him on the ground he got a little bit rydym gobble they got right now at the nose tackle where is cut out the left in for straight runs it is a first down <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> and align leading the way and right was over there with a couple of panic just tripped really over his own blocking in a gain of a yard out to the 27 yard line and jack del rio knows that they have to run the ball they have to continue to feed it to <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> the more that you can run it you can eat time off the clock and keep <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> standing on the sidelines next to bill belichick the way to stop this offense here in new england is to not give them the ball ranks things is the no 10 second down and nine your running back to whoopi <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashad</person> james on a living you huh tori hope are the best in the business and it is ever playing on to the 33yard line it s a gain of 7 on the play and hell be out now to go along with the 34 it s just a quick throw but watch 97 <person player="jarvis green" race="nonwhite" position="DE">jarvis green</person> he puts the hit in the lick on <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard before the ball gets to hope the court makes that slant catch and then the ball is close to the first down marker and tori haute is the guy back he s going to catch a lot of ball tough guys it s going to going the middle s bit going it for 11 straight season 50 passes the more just incredible often even 23rd miss short to see the allotment of receivers including a rookie tight end out there and a whistle and a timeout the first by jacksonville 535 in the first the jaguars on the move the nfl on cbs is sponsored by southwest airlines go to southwestcom grab your bag it s on sirius xm here how satellite radio is changing the way you listen and by bud <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> with the just right taste that s not too heavy not too <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> the difference is drinkability jacksonville just took a timeout in a company in fumble it 21 they move down to the 35 second service road on this drive go down him on turns to an event field thomas on the move and the end around chased by panza came here when they all want to creep stick and he gets the first down no gain on the play looks like jacksonville will after booted away let s see what they stopped that ball shy of the first down we go to the deepest getting better by the day he plates together that s the unit very well warming from that secondary level and he had a bead onto the ball carrier <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike thomas</person> stopping them before he could hit the first half you liked the call i love the call you have to do something they had run it consecutively right at the line of scrimmage not gil real bill belichick resulted on fourth down no one does it more than these two teams especially had to go forth in one jones through hittite enters grill back to the 35 oh im down and look at where jacksonville gives it up gambling early and losing the role that i know a little bit event <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> has been a big story with his great communication in the second during the last couple weeks they forced him to go silent before the first down block all for the new england patriots theyd like to win today when the division get that third spot as they battle cincinnati for so absolutely win today they get another division title as you see it so it s an important game and they dont get tired of division titles around here do you think that it s just a whole hum experience but these these people and of course the players on the team and everyone in the community of a chalk it up with every single win take the question the decision is dont put up fourth down there my tack go about that second here for the 35 yard line first in 10 this is a semi more go get broke on the play from here is it by cognizant runt down in the secondary after dazzling run on 21 yards down to the 14 yard line first in june this is why you dont do it look they lit him right there and then why she find the alley hell cut it back away from the safety to get to the second level and if you give the patriots often great field position theyll take advantage of it i thought that it <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> t to r is could have taken the crowd out of it and you really knock <person player="tom brady" race="white"

what <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> ross stays alive make the tackle even when they tried to block them i think that s an incredible defensive play by <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david garrard</person> even though it was a fourth roll over the middle tinea <person player="montavious stanley" race="UNK" position="DL">stanley</person> has come on the defensive line the chancellor jaguars first and 10 from the 27 yard line and this around his ankles in a gang of er down to the 26 yard line that

miss libby thugs seven there s no path roger on <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> break so they can allow the defenders to get down the field now watch the protection here a very clean pocket life through his left throw the ball down the field can trip breakers always been more than just a run blocker he s an athletic side in that can make catches in traffic and he rewards its quarterback by making the play there seven years with the jets originally a third round pick by new york a 26 yard throw by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> with his second touchdown passes over 4,000 yards for the year kuskowski swings his leg through trading with this 26th touchdown pass 14 nothing new england some of the complaints about this patriot offense was searching for an identity trying to find some consistency they come ahead in the beginning of this game today yeah we told you i think at the top they needed

had bought season tickets and he would go to these games eventually he buys the team back in 1994 if they win three championships he builds this beautiful stadium the complex around it and he has been such a great citizen for new england in particular for the national football and he s a visionary and he has made i think not only this the better team but he s made a league back them terms of some of the things that he has done to support the field is dependent i invented that nose technical the basics first out in tank <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite"

to history to have a <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> throwing touchdown passes he s been at three times today loss for two of them we began the broadcast talking about how his effort had been debated by experts coast to coast that was pretty good today and look what <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> did on that drive a at 55 to 59 yards and <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> under a lot of criticism not giving the effort and game against miami and carolina sent home after coming to work late i think hell fella texas done a good job was really helping them go understand you got rededicated and committed to place display the difficulty lack numbers of want individuals their sizes a 24yard return well they have so much respect for belichick especially what he has done in the month of december to take a look at jack del rio s in a transitional year himself with his team and he wanted to prepare his very young team to come out here and play the pages that he spent all week selling them on the fact that hey this is not the 2005 or 2007 patriot team that went 16 and no he said he wanted to strip the mystique away from the teams those things come out of relaxed well down 28 nothing at halftime so i tell you right now they must think theyre playing against the world jet his game and i believe they are the patients are battling to hit a world championship every single year such defense events to the 26 burst down in 10 walk by the titan even think that sam

for a first down with a 36 yard line and timeout or jacksonville let s see him go burn their second walk number 59 i thought guide to $50 in here after hit through here the service is a transitional season all right let s take a look at 32 new players from last year 16 of them are rookies and tear those players are playing significant roles with this team especially your offensive line guys like <person player="eugene monroe" race="nonwhite" position="OT">eugene</person> moreau evan brittany you talked about those are the cook in that are supposed to protect your quarterback and so youve got young corners like <person player="derek cox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">derek cox</person> and <person player="terrance knighton" race="nonwhite" position="DT">terrance knighton</person> at the nose tackle position i think jack del rio is not a fabulous job coaching this team this year they didnt expect to be contending for a playoff spot so late in the year playing with such a young football that s a good point an uncertain season to begin with having meeting at the very end he said he s had the most fun coaching this year more than any other year not half the whole lot fun right now first intended for <person player="jonathan wilhite" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilhite</person> is there and works his way to the 43 yard line that s a pickup of seven on the play young players like this <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike thomas</person> he s a rookie out of arizona he is the alltime pac10 leading receiver so if they get them involved it s it s going to make this team stronger than this is a teaching moment for this football team you talked about the young player the new players come down swilly aint nothing why not spread it out why not get the pass game going see what you got in your quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard see what you have in your young receivers mike sims walter and <person player="mike thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike thomas</person> and now these young players even though jones high tends to get going i think youve got to be able to do things different there s been other teams have been able to make place throwing the ball against the patriots defense i think you got to allow your office to open it up and give them a chance being aggressive get the ball down six defensive ends cyber purchase all riders at 8 the rose record item 3 this was over the head of <person player="troy williamson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">troy</person> <person player="torry holt" race="nonwhite" position="WR">holt</person> coverage of the play by lee but take a look at the comparison of our 240 banks today <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> who s done the three touchdown passes in gerard and the one interception from <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard has been costly because the patriots have turned it into points why he s completed 10 of 13 passes look at the quarterback rating for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> 145 point three three touchdown passes on the day only two incompletions all day for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> remembered he completed his first seven passes of the game third down in three jacksonville is out of time just before halftime here in foxborough with the patriots are seven and oh this season defense <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> last week is there once again pink events was their loss of the yard it is a sack it will be bent to the 43 yard line so they talked about the teams they get a lot of pressure on the quarterback and theyve done that the last couple weeks is there a tree of defense in third quarter of the office coordinator for jack bill wanted to spread them out they want to throw the ball down the field they want to challenge that pages deepest but the protection has to be able to hold up remember johnson field playing with two would be often times bill belichick knows it so you bring in a veteran pass rusher like derek <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> and he comes right around the corner and beats the right tackle evan britain to put pressure on <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gurrah so in the england has called a timeout and ten seconds to play look at jack del rio who said to us earlier this week that he has studied a lot of what belichick has done he studied a lot of the ways he manages the game he conducts training campy he is one of his idols yeah and he goes for it on fourth down as much as bill belichick does yes he knows the percentages and knows oz weve seen him do it earlier in this ballgame even though i wouldnt have done it a pompous godless real punt it really set the tone for the game that baby wont fall he s in the time running out there halftime here in foxborough well three touchdown passes by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> pop two of them <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">baker</person> the tight end caught one and <person player="sammy morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> at a oneyard touchdown run at the end of the first half take a break then come back to cbs nr halftime from newark it is clearing here in foxborough and the playoff picture is clearing in the afc as the patriots round top 28 not that reminder this game is brought to you in high definition here on cbs with salman wilcox <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> ireland an impressive first half for these patriots seven and oh at home getting closer to winning another as the east division title is because of the play of <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> coming out in the first half how about this for touchdown caprese balkan firsthalf possession the first one going over to <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> going up top to the tight end <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">chris baker</person> theyve used the running game it s very that me more come out big time running the ball in the first half another touchdown two balls in the back of the end zone seeing this office go to another level capri dude they had not lost their confidence and theyve come out and look 150 yards but then equally so 141 yards on the ground so great balance even though they had the one turnover on that first possession and boy the jacksonville jaguars not nearly as productive on seven first downs in the first half compared to 16 for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> in the new england patriots <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> has been terrific and seemingly now finding more continuity and identity with that offense as the season goes on it couldnt happen at a better time and again new england and cincinnati that s very important mainly fighting for that third spot both are nine and five coming into today s same conference record at six and four same common opponent record of two and two but the strength of schedule the strength of schedule for the new england patriots might be the key get down to that fourth tiebreaker and new england has a slim edge in that category given what it bill belichick call this a hat and tshirt game it is a hazard easter day because if they win it theyre going to pass out hats and tshirts theyre going to find another division title and it s not something that they take lightly around and you think that all the winnings theyve done around is a no big deal yeah we win another division so it s something to point to and it s something to work for for bill belichick it theyre proud of the accomplishments theyve made around here can tell you right now the banners hanging in gillette stadium signify i think a dynasty one of the most successful teams in any decade employee if they won a lot over a hundred win in this decade that s part of that mystique youre talking about with the new england patriots earlier and that belichick is trying to link one great era to another this is certainly a transitional season for the new england patriots losing big names like bruce ki and seymour and free ball and i mean <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> on to harrison runnin down the line and then to have this young team in to build week by week in the game plan the way he does has been very it is good a coaching job some people say that he s had to come out and win a division title in a year where youre supposed to be greedy tells you how good theyre coaching up this football good point on it and so my parents will bring it these swarms his way with <person player="nick kaczur" race="white" position="OG">nick</person> eviction kidding my first things being simple today of the 26 yard line returning it for 28 or the first half possession for the jacksonville jaguars four consecutive punch took him to halftime yeah and you could see that theyre very anemic just not able to sustain drag that first possession eight plays were the longest of their possessions in the first half and i think theyve got to be able to sustain it you have to go back to the running game you cant totally get away from but reese tells drew but really this game is now in the hands of their quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> were all but then have to defensive line as that <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> will be down so they got right at the nose guard and <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> outside first things in for quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gurgaon expert i am in a rookie out of nebraska omaha <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> gain of eight on the play and he s up to about the 34 yard line and he was a college quarterback theyve converted him to a tight end you know we say the game is going to be in the hands that <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard throwing the football down 28 nothing at halftime again that means the game is also in the hands of this two offensive tackles in rotary <person player="eugene monroe" race="nonwhite" position="OT">eugene monroe</person> and evan britain because if they cant protect the quarterback no way jacksonville is going to be able to get back into the game five defensive backs including <person player="jonathan wilhite" race="nonwhite" position="DB">wilhite</person> suckin down into miss jones drew stuffed by fans occasionally precinct dean last against buffalo that s a gain of about a yard hell be near the 35 yard line right now you should see the improve that i think up front only basket k is a guy that had three sacks one week ago against buffalo and they had six packed in that game filter prior to that they really was struggling get to the quarterback he leave the team with eight and a half back this year he had left his team via free agency and now come back this year really been one of their best players in the front seven say hours in for defensive backs third down and one brendan s got an interception already today and to the thirtyfive theyll stop him there and to get the first down to the 36 and he s shy you think theyre going to go for it on fourth down we said jack del rio and bill belichick love to go for it on fourth down and jack who studied all the percentages he feels like it s something that they can convert they failed and their first 4th down to hit theyre going to go for it here early in the second half prior is coming up and i was guard here fourth down and one the second best rushing quarterback in the national football league a stout hard guy to bring down picks up two plows for the first down to the 37 yard line had one of the things that build on had talked about was the running ability not necessarily on display right there but overall the running ability of <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> carr there s no doubt any time you have a porter cracking throws balls accurately is davis arise that throw a lot of interceptions even though he has one in this game today but when he can break down your defense by running the football it just really makes it i think a difficult challenge to stop quarterback to creating first day where it is on site right inside first attempt by the secondary through july 40 yard line that s a pickup of four on the blood <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> is locked up in coverage c51 over to the right side lots of pink covers against maurice jones ooh okay if youre a live back and say he s quicker and faster than i am oh yeah he s going to make the catch but what you cant give up his yards after the catch and mail did what he does best make tackles which is why he leave the football team in that category still the nickel on second and six wilfred the tied in with the block jones theyre going to run him all day long he is a pocket hercules and he takes it down to the 42 yard line on the new england patriots and brought down on the play by kite what you love about maurice jones who first guy doesnt get the tackle watch will hai come up try to make this tackle look make him this second guy misses and now he said the third left olivia fifa s <person player="jerod mayo" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mayo</person> ask the getting from behind in order to get him down 17 yard catch and run jaguars affront only one play in patriots territory deepest penetration right here the 42 <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> in the bank deal with the first and tenth he throws <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> who became a hit and transferred the liberty goes blank into the defense of brandon terry weather and climbs into his defense for 13 picks up the first out of the 29 you might say okay now why are they able to move the ball and they were able to move the ball before i think for one they werent spreading out his defense number two the protection the <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard was not holding up both things are happening now at a level in the second habit we didnt see happening in the first half and <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> garage getting the ball out of his name were just on the wing fire in the middle right is up first and 10 this is punch ends again digs and hit by stander s the ball was jarred fries are going to make him that <person player="mark levoir" race="white" position="OT">mark</person> him down at about the 24 yard line jungle the ball incomplete tense incomplete pass it complete pass but watch garage he s not going to get caught holding the ball the pressures there the pockets collapsing he takes a lick but only after he s gotten rid of it and <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> not able to hold on to it that ball was never caught or secure i was curious to see if the loss of their great blocking fullback ray jones would affect this team a little bit sure it does on the field of practice the locker room and sometimes in the running and a lead yeah blocker for <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> he s a guy that contains the lightest rated taking out the linebackers to clear a path for him jd9 play of the drive second when his <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jonesdrew</person> and dumping them is prior he was a fouryear starter at kentucky in a sixthround pick he s a rookie it s a gain of two to the 27th but now were going to be faced with that third long opportunity that and talked about that doesnt intimidate the jacksonville jaguars if you havent seen mike simms walker get involved in the office sorry hope theyve gone to him a couple of times and observe jackieo real knows how important this first possession here in the second half year for his football player think of itches <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> will be the only towering up lineman look at all the linemen her down and eight did a lot of this last week in buffalo a sideon job that was fought by mike sims longer just talking about his era whether is right there the former number one pick out of miami it s a nineyard gain ville spotted at the 18 <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard hold on to this fall to the very last second when look he knows if he s got to get a hit but see just he sort of lobbed it up there and allowed mike s and walkers under it there s the head we have he taken a lot of these during the course of this team exact a lot to talk about this battle off the field with crohn s disease which is something that he is one in his maintaining and managing right now but that was debilitating earlier in his career this content from the 18th green thomas ridgewell durante cana for argument the 14 yard line the male former defensive rookie of the year in the national football league he s a very good football player hi football iq this is a complex defense they run with the new england pages and boy does he get it and everybody talked about why he s not making the same number of play we did last year he s got a lot more on his plate with a lot of those veterans that we talked about and played with him last year you could just run around and make plays now he s got to do the thinking man are the brains of the defense as well as going out from big to play four linebackers one down linemen on the far side that s <person player="derrick burgess" race="nonwhite" position="DE">burgess</person> on the near side kaito second down and six will you decide to run a little gain of five right there he some standards at the bottom of that pile and the stop on <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> they talked about him this week and how his verbally how his communication in the secondary has been a big improvement for the defensive coverage for doing think about it someone had to step up in the absence of rocky harrison need a guide like <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">james sanders</person> to step up it makes the play if we looked at the ride so far ive run pepa pass plays ball is in the handle <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gordon one jacksonville struggled in the run zone this year he scored on man my try to adjust kent in you can see that the avalanche of offenders coming through and making a stop including <person player="junior seau" race="nonwhite" position="LB">junior seau</person> that s a gain of two juniors sale it is 20th year the national football league it still plays with the enthusiasm of a guy who s been in the league two years i dont know how he does it i thought the body keep going remember he came out of usc after his sophomore season you know he was a young guy when he came into the league he s gotten everything out of it forty years of age they phases brett farr but he s alive back about four to five inches first in 57 and here at the side of gerard oh what a 33 tie just a finger wide took it on the face and dodge to the 5 where he was brought down by <person player="myron pryor" race="nonwhite" position="DT">myron</person> prior on a gain of 2 a deceptive move and sails audio death really struck gold i think it s a yeah just coming right up again did not have the ball to clear the bases because if things were correct he had to tackle one guy he didnt know that gerard was going to keep it he decided to tackle running back and allow the quarterback to go first that was the charge and against the bruin usc against ucla second okapi have eight minutes ryan to begin the second half on the 5 joan threw up one this time <person player="james sanders" race="nonwhite" position="DB">sanders</person> was there and they were going for the rookie tight end <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">zach miller</person> across the middle the problem is <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard cannot step up in the pocket the pocket is disintegrating so quickly and give the basics where theyre not going to allow him to grow comfortable in the pocket so theyre going to pressure every gap to bring a pressure off the edges militants bringing pressure up the middle into the face of <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard remember you have to containing because he s a mobile quarterback within you have to apply pressure and it s safe also force them to throw the ball off his back foot this is the 16 play of the drive version go on to find the defensive backs back there five of them intercepted i10 this is picked off by the room <person player="shawn springs" race="nonwhite" position="DB">shawn springs</person> first interception of the season he s played for the seahawks he s played for the rick skiers and now he is a patriot gerard picked off the ninth prince own turnover an nfl high for jacksonville two interceptions today thrown by <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard that one in the red zone yeah nine red zone giveaways most in the nfl is just squandering opportunities to put points on the board and now if hillary ballmer was moving false start false start off number 76 five yard penalty remains first down that is the first penalty against the new england patriots today and here is an interesting score from down in south florida battle over seven and seven houston now leading miami 2073 a loss with virtually knock miami out it would virtually but not completely and i think that s the main thing and so jacksonville was one of six afc teams inter the week here with a seven and seven record its first and 15 this is <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> and <person player="justin durant" race="nonwhite" position="LB">durant</person> lassos him at the 13 yard line that s a pickup of nine <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> has been sensational today nine receptions 102 yards and it s the pittsburgh steelers on top of baltimore by 10 there early in the third if pittsburgh also enter the week seven and seven now with a tenpoint lead in that ballgame that s a very important game baltimore ravens losing that game that would open the door for a number of teams to pass them up for that wildcard spot balkan the backfield <person player="stephen neal" race="nonwhite" position="OL">neal</person> s still playing that right guard second down and six lensing connelly at that right guard a bit today <person player="sammy morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">sammy morris</person> and brought down by ferpa is a gain of two and theyll put him solomon at the 16 yard line so this new england offense which has been looking for an identity has been very inconsistent looking for the right mix if you will and <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> puts himself right at the core of that issue has seemingly found some of these things over the last couple especially today against james oh there s no doubt about it and he did it starts with a week of practice that he had not been able to practice leading up to the last few games because whether it s a finger injury or the shoulder injury he s battled some nagging body parts and the fact that he could get on the practice er he said very important important third down and four to five bring a first down pastor welcome how about there that was amazing what hilton dustin 7yard gain the first out of the 24 he s gone three now you got to get decide if you come for you got to get to the quarterback a groan he just whipped on the play and if you are laughter the national football league but only 14 sec s coming into this game when you get your hands on the quarterback youve got to grab and hold on to make sure you get them on the ground there s a first down numbers in the backfield with greek drone three touchdown passes today to talk to the tiny babies over the pacific with the sample and about the 44 yard line good strike 20 yard game <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> through the air has been terrific 79 for 187 right he just booked this one up for malt there s a lot of trouble to just throw this one up knowing that <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> going to come down with it working against the rookie he did a double move on derek on but it s just a jump ball situation for boston rewards <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> by going up at the highest point for the ball coming down with it he s been facing a lot of double and tripleteamed toughest still yet another thousand yards deep roars the vet bill burst in ten where it is at his last 10 revealed little bamboo for the quarterback in college who sneaks up the side goes into regulation here it was fun today after ineffective play manning took advantage of him last week as did the gold 11yard gain right there to the 45 and watch 81 <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> out in front see this block here i just think that s phenomenal but kids <person player="derek cox" race="nonwhite" position="DB">derek cox</person> and that s what they want from <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> all the time but boy theyre getting his best play at the right time of year i think he s one of the best wide receivers to ever play the game bounce for kimmy oh i think the numbers would suggest that the numbers do it thanks a ton for is interesting <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is really on a roll morrison knocked down there by smith uses interesting a couple minutes ago and that gain is to the 45yard line theyll stay right there about reps and how <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> felt in this week and is getting his reps if you take a look at some of the numbers associated with today s game manning is a big rep guy i dont know any great athlete that has not been a rep guy particularly at the quarterback position if youre going to function at a very high level you have to have the reps during the week you have to gain that rhythm the chemistry and then the trust whether when you get into a game now youre not thinking it s almost as if the body takes over it s on auto time you can operate with any level of fitness when youve had the worked in track second contender the block behind maybe a fistfight <person player="sean considine" race="white" position="DB">considine</person> rather well the ex eagle it is the loss of three not to the 47 yard line <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> is catching the ball every single time they throw it to him and boy and they done so a lot today getting it over the middle dominated taking many licks core strong 53 he could dominate the hash area and they get outside at the number 1lt monsters got the two touchdowns look <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> so far 12 catches in the game today over a hundred yards receipt hitting receiver in the national football league third down and 12 rejection over they tell you about volkema back deal here comes rose and burning foods up <person player="nick

couple on a 28 yard gain make the stop <person player="julian edelman" race="white" position="WR">edelman</person> a seventh round pick out of kansas state was a college football quarterback and now youve just heard you steve review were asking here earlier <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> and look at and test the ball over the middle almost <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> life a facility to run those options to dominate over the middle of the field and when you can have this many weapons weve seen both tied in late two plays gentlemen <person player="benjamin watson" race="nonwhite" position="TE">watson</person> <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">chris baker</person> and then

has been right on the screws today here s an end off on first and the boys weve got a 1 yard touchdown run already tackled by <person player="gerald alexander" race="UNK" position="DB">gerald alexander</person> the x lion in the backfield it s a sevenyard pickup down to the 12 yard line and that may be the final play of the quarter it is <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> is going to walk off were going to count it down from 24 itll be second 3 when we come back in <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> today three touchdown passes <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> has caught two of them and two turnovers by jacksonville and it would look like weve got a champion in

here in foxborough it has been a beautiful afternoon especially in the second half go to the fourth with the new england patriots leading 28 nothing over jacksonville big gain for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> 20 of 22 224 yards he has gone over 4000 yards for the season he s thrown three touchdown passes and now as if putting the icing on the cake <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> is in for the first time the ex jacksonville jaguar who was let go in february after playing 11 seasons there and really became the face and the player that was representing that franchise in that community is in the game for the first time he made a lot of comments this week about the jacksonville jaguars and about how much they prepare in new england he said he didnt mean anything negative about the team it he didnt mean to really put the city you know under the microscope in terms of the amount of games blacked out and here talked about you know they may end up moving to la he said he wants this team to remain in jacksonville and he is really has rooted for them ever since a week 3 at the beginning of the season it s sunken down in three and they blow that dead as you see a false start it s going to go on the new england patriots full sorry office number 76 fiveyard penalty remains second now <person player="sebastian vollmer" race="white" position="OT">sebastian</person> the second round pick out of houston picking that up here s what <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> has done is here is an inactive wish nine straight weeks because he had some torn ligaments in his ankle he had surgery so he has been out he s had one 100yard game this season it was earlier in the year it was against atlanta if they can get him going down the stretch that they go into the postseason that s a good long a lot of trouble rivera poe very good point second down and eight vacant area to go inside at the touchdown for <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> his third today bagon de france tailor what everyone calls from france tailor to the left stop freddy yeah let s leave ready boss oneonone against the rookie quarterback it mall to be able to stretch that ball just across the goal line before he hits the ground for third touchdown of the day we told you they awakened a sleeping giant him by being a highly critical a rarity balls and boy of the answer this is the sheen s event tennessee game it was fifty nine to nothing in the snow here earlier in the year and in a game that had playoff implications both ways and for the jacksonville jaguars who it s been like a playoff game for a while now for them just a point and stay alive now as a challenge by jack del rio he s going to see if maybe the knee of <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> was down at the one before he got that ball across the line look at the numbers for <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> event in completions after attempting 23 throws doctor he really on the field on the suspect rebel take a look at it and so jack del rio and 1454 to go here in the fourth is going to look at that play time on the nfl on cbs is sponsored by southwest airlines go to southwest calm grab your bag it s on <person player="zach miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> lite triple hops brewed for that great pilsner taste taste greatness and by burger king who remind you to have it your way jacksonville coach jack del rio has just challenged a touchdown lunge by <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> gonna catch it about the 2 and a 1/2 the buffalo wanted to get it over in time and that s not a very distinctive picture right there tough to see the ball have broken the plane of the goal line but cant tell if his knee was down through and theyre going to need something conclusive there s evidence to overturn the call on the field remember the call on the field was ruled a touchdown for <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> in to think solomon that early in the game the patriots fumbled at the one this could be a worse score than it is right now he s come in <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy</person> montes after his years ruling on the field stands im convinced they couldnt help it but the pictures just ignited it was inconclusive inconclusive three touchdowns on the day for <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> answering the critics really putting out and jack theyre real knew that this is a guy that could really <person player="matt light" race="white" position="OT">light</person> you up it came into today s game with ten touchdowns three on the day gives in thirteen for the year might resent at the top of the show you spent the week at nfl films watching a lot of tape of boss for your weekly show on the nfl network and and you were trying to digest all the defeat by the experts around the country if his his effort was there you think it was and it certainly has been today and he is flossing four touchdown passes by <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> three two <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> and all that criticism was being shot at <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> was the one that really stuck up for him on his team he really did he supported <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy</person> and even if coach supported him maybe he tells the definitely what they expect him to do and i think quietly there s no doubt they wanted more effort but i think that college you get teased over the hump and that s how youre able to weather the storm of adversity to support from the quarterback <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> he supports his number one weapon remember how many years he had lobby for the coastal guard they go get me some playmaker and in the same year and oh seven season they bring in both west <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">welker</person> and <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy</person> basketboy if they paid off picked on there s thomas with the five aaron dibble bring him down river house relic assigned even for more money but he wanted to make sure there was something left the till for guys like boss in the future both of them thousand yard seasons three consecutive years at our own the nfl on cbs is sponsored by fedex we understand your business could use a dick butkus pep talk and by geico were 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance and amaz is caught three touchdown passes today from <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> who is thrown four overall will come the jacksonville jaguars 77015 today only 30 times early in the course the vent feeling gerard is under sentence six defensive backs for new england employee into the secondary and finally brought down by merryweather as an interception today that s a 22yard explosion to the 48 yard line up the wing powers are <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> look at that finding the seam right here look at him just continuing to press the hole a couple of directions we way that he could have gone if he was running very hard through the hole going to the blanc here find time for devon revises rookie receiver thomas at about the 29 yard line <person player="brandon meriweather" race="nonwhite" position="DB">meriweather</person> there to make the stop 19 yard pickup there <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard got this offense moving they moved the ball at times but it has been the turnovers that s been costly for <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard and that s a real office <person player="rashad jennings" race="nonwhite" position="RB">jennings</person> remains in the back feet first intent at the 10 yard line as a great catch made downfield by <person player="nate hughes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">nate hughes</person> who makes the grab right there <person player="nate hughes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hughes</person> with the ball good cat and what about the throw over the defender <person player="brandon meriweather" race="nonwhite" position="DB">brandon meriweather</person> thought he had a pick who has high and <person player="nate hughes" race="nonwhite" position="WR">hughes</person> went up and got it so good throw by goose <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard and then even better cats by hugh levon was defending a man who stops with ins through the air 22 19 and 20 yards first and goal of the night and trying to preserve that shutout which is important everybody from militant all the way right down there s no doubt about it is a source of pride jones drew in the backfield is thomas it was real high did he get over here oh i thought maybe he got over but no at the 2 yard line i thought he got over while i saw my challenge ny official was deepika is no touchdown while the other one said no they looked at each other they had to be on the same pace see if he got the ball across the pylon before going on that s a cutter see he would signal a touchdown i think it s a touchdown rebound let s see if that deal shortly from the fire second goal for two and three the quarterback <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard his third of the season two yard touchdown run and the shutout the strong the mobility in terms of what bill belichick feared the most he can break you down by moving look at that making defenders miss one two three it did just drag the rest of the guys right into the end zone really good play by <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> gerard to put dr view on the board i think he was certain that he was trying to come back out and the coaching sense to get back out there and he did and of course he takes it in for the six and now here is <person player="josh scobee" race="white" position="K">josh scobee</person> to try to tack on one more the hole that was a good one offensive through punish the punter was holding and theyre looking at the right leg of gerard who was dazzling on this one weaving his way in on a two yard touchdown run they were looking at gerard his right leg you can see he s a tough guy to begin with he is one of three injuries theyve had an offense hold us out with a finger mercedes <person player="marcedes lewis" race="nonwhite" position="TE">lewis</person> had a head injury early in the game <person player="luke mccown" race="white" position="QB">luke mccown</person> is warming up he s only thrown three passes today and he did not have the benefit of a pretty campaign here s the plate we think gerard got hurt on the yes see here s a kid apply some pressure you can see goes down and there he is holding his leg he was ready to come out of course victim to stay in it for good reason oh theyre expecting the end side kick and this one s going to flutter into the end zone will be a touchback as well curtis lets it go so there being a first in 10 to 20 gerard still a little bit shaken up he did just run that one and no from two for the touchdown i dont know how <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> doesnt have a perfect quarterback rating he s 21 and 23 241 yards east on four touchdowns done a single pick and looked virtually perfect and everyone completed his first seven passes of the game didnt have two incompletions one which was a throwaway he s now completed his last 15 passes <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> in the back booth which is a person s in of a touch back at the 20yard line to go to the nearside if they go to the far side looking for <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> giant the ball seconds in heaven as we come to the end of a decade they can look at the great teams the 1970 dallas cowboys had 105 wins in the 74 them 1990 113 we instead a new record for most in any decade by the niners and now how about this the patriot 111 wins and 115 for the indianapolis colts i ask you who is the team of the decade it is a team with the most range of the fascias or the 115 in this decade five for colt that was the three yard run by first a low and second down and 10 and the colts as you can see in terms of wins but i look at those sb rings down there at the end yeah three championship rings by the new england patriots in this decade but the 115 wins in this decades the most ever in any decade by any different team so i think this super bowl to be played in miami right here on cbs might decide the article will be on the sidelines for that game out third down and eight were <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">faulk</person> in the backfield maybe back to pro tackle made by chiron <person player="tyron brackenridge" race="UNK" position="DB">brackenridge</person> picks up 19 yards on the play well for 13th catch of the day how about this <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> still firing away west and koch are still catching anything that s thrown to them this is still follows able to make the defenders miss and look how they open it up and create a seam in there behind sam akin he draws most of the covers to lord helmet <person player="wes welker" race="white" position="WR">wes welker</person> makes good use of very small spaces all in the cat s <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> in the backfield and the first content for the 41 and then tackle down the play try to e weve got a handout of them also herring s athena being on the plane look at that scores they start the fourth quarter in pittsburgh pittsburgh had a tenpoint lead now baltimore s comes storming back and they drop support quarterly i think theyve won like five leads in the fourth quarter this one would be the most devastating as a loss there with knocked them out of the play second down and two intimate will be the third lincoln is out there and tear remains for them <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> and runs down the play by jeremy navarro rookie out of maryland it s a gang of four he s down to the 47 yard line and once again a look at the playoff picture in the afc though baltimore look at it at eight and six a win over the pittsburgh steelers would move them to nine and six and boy would that be huge for them and the pittsburgh steelers look at them flinging and talking about being in the hunt clinging on for a wildcard spot it is evidence of it is <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom</person> fitton it s amin to capture that same emotion that may have possessed you the year before when you want a super bowl absolutely no hangover perhaps for the steelers and a lot of injuries to by now polamalu is effective here s a first down intent that s against buffalo bill driven out of bounds by knox 40yard line and a victim of seven on the plate just to extend them that wisdom of solomon future we just saw if you go back to the 60s green bay yeah go back to the 50s the cleveland browns back to the 40 s prominent tape and probably green bay in chicago another case in third and none of them ever won 115 games in one decade that s a new nfl record set by the indianapolis colts and bill belichick is / there s just four games behind the coat second degree and this is a run by <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> who picks up two on the play and brought down on the line by there s a great book by belichick it s been out on jeff belichick readily by <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> the late <person player="david garrard" race="nonwhite" position="QB">david</person> halberstam out a couple years ago it s a great read that son of a coach which is this dad of course was it navy duff 38 years and bill was there as a kid watching tape watching film at that time and he just absorbed everything he saw from his dad it was a wonderful relationship and youll always remember the picture of son and father on the sidelines one of those super bowl wins but that book is worth reading if youre just a football fan because it s so detail on it here s a third and one and a gain of a couple on the play <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> if you love football like bill belichick does and you read that book i think it sort of chronicles just how he was raised in the game he s um posed like a prodigy terms of understanding this game at a very early age being able to look at film in dissect all fences as well as defense that s what i dont think he gets enough credit for what a great coach he is on both sides of the ball not just on one side i know everyone gives him credit for putting together real dominant defenses but he can coach on the offensive side in at every single position on the football nine play of the drive and briony we was there to make the stop it s a gain of four down to the 32 yard line and here is a team a patriot team which is let s see they began the season five and two they hit the bye week then they went four and three in that span they won two in overall a day they lost two in a row and they were trying to really find their way it seems like today maybe they have hit their stride and what a great time of the year to peak what a great time to hit your stride and when you talk to the players that s what they came here looking for today more than just another division title they were looking for a complete game one that saw them plays very well all feel quarters employ of they found it the guard family was in the backfield leading the way for <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> loss of a yard <person player="jeremy navarre" race="white" position="DE">navarre</person> jumps on the pylon that second and five as we take you to new york and james brown <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> we knows 50 is were going to try to nail down the division but kansas city making it tough on them look at matt cassel great catch concentration holds on to the ball that being ted castile about 20 yards strike it is all not at 10 in cincinnati back to <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> and solomon can you believe the bengals are so much at stake we just play around with the team like kansas city at home at home and that would open the doors let s say for team like baltimore because the bengals have yet to clinch at the division title its third down and six <person player="paul mcquistan" race="white" position="OT">paul</person> <person player="logan mankins" race="nonwhite" position="OG">logan</person> man get with the blocks and ease down after a gain of five yards on the play with the tackle made by quintin <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">groves</person> the second round pick two years ago out of auburn <person player="kevin faulk" race="nonwhite" position="RB">kevin</person> funk is it a nice career and allpurpose yards leader and history of this franchise and a beautiful day it s turned out to be a beautiful day after a ton of rain the last couple days in the new england air what a beautiful facility look at the replica of the lighthouse the other wonderful shops and malls a theater and boy what a pallet robert kraft is guilty wits for them one breathing again for the second time taking that good paper inside the plows from yards it against the first down a gain of two to the 25yard line on the play and speaking of that weve got you know one of the nice features of this entire complex is a hall of fame that theyve got right on the grounds theyre over 36,000 square feet it contains interactive multimedia exhibits and artifacts pertaining to the patriots in the history of football in new england the pants three lombardi trophies are theyre the two best i think in the in the league and these are two very progressive franchises green bay s hall of fame and the hall of famer that the football exhibit that robert kraft and family have constructed here for the fans and it s always about giving back to the fan and a great educational tour ive taken the tour and tossed about the history of the new england area and the football team but kids can come here on field trips and receive a tremendous education learn more about the league but they learn a lot about the area in which they live and play dumb about giving back i dont know if anyone s given back more than robert kraft in the fans here but more proud of this football team and it really is i think the thing that that finds everyone together and pull them all together they come from everywhere just a flock here to gillette stadium on sundays to watch their team play maybe the drive gets front divide <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> today who s thrown the four touchdown passes is 23 of 26 years a second down and five <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> at five in the previous play it s blocked from huntley and then smith s the linebacker brings them down at about the 19 yard line this is of course the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the old american football league in the patriots one of those franchise one of the original eight and so in going back to those days and honoring those players and those great mavericks of that time led by lamar hunt in kansas city you know it s been that kind of exhibit and that kind of feel from these original eight teams which has been so fun to watch in this season and you can go through that museum by robert kraft and youll see the oh boston patriots geno cappelletti and some of the great players there were a lot of fraud the wine third they searched for the tribe began back at the 20yard line on a touchback first <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taylor</person> once again they canyon cloaking his way alexander among the company to make the stop is pushed to it first down of the here the 15yard line and im sure for <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> this has got to be some sweet revenge playing on a team that s going to be significant at the end of his season going into the playoffs and and now that he is healthy he like you said earlier he could have a significant role he s one of those guys is happy to get that hat and tshirt again nine years since he played on the division winner and he talked about it with aziz is proud as anyone to be a member of the new england patriots in to be a part of a winning season late in your career you cherish these moments more than one <person player="john henderson" race="nonwhite" position="DT">john</person> lee on the backfield to guard hell lead the way for <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> got the first down hunch was right there with a stop and a dignitary and down to the 13 yard line before the game we saw this on the field about two hours before kickoff today <person player="fred taylor" race="nonwhite" position="RB">fred taylor</person> who has a great affection for a lot of his teammates and former coaches and he was a leader in that locker room but he did say some things earlier this week that kind of hit people maybe the wrong way but that guy right there number 32 <person player="maurice jonesdrew" race="nonwhite" position="RB">maurice jonesdrew</person> swears when he said when i came in the league i needed a mentor i needed guidance and he provided that for me as a guy who was a veteran in the nfl showed maurice shows through how to work how to take care of body hub out of you leader for other players and particularly at difficult times and out of state of course it helped your coaching staff and around the 17th play the drive and he stuck right there by sniffing about the 9 yard line and a gain of 3 yards block now approaching the twominute warning that s what well take you to so the new england patriots who have gone seven and oh at home this year will finish this season a perfect undefeated 80 know at home in <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> will have won his 23rd consecutive home games as a starting quarterback for the new england patient i think it s incredible and you know the team s grow through adversity i think this patriots team in 2009 has grown see some adversities of the sea <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">tom brady</person> a commanding performance today in this home game in these thon four touchdown passes 32 <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy moss</person> one to his tight end <person player="chris baker" race="nonwhite" position="TE">chris baker</person> <person player="sammy morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">sammy morris</person> with the oneyard touchdown run and those numbers how that cant be 156 point three to not know amazing cant get much better than it s a perfect performance e second down and seven right now here at the twominute warning and my guess is they will run this down even though timeouts remaining multiples for both teams look at <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">moss</person> a great day for <person player="randy moss" race="nonwhite" position="WR">randy</person> and as you said i think youre accurately before maybe the giant has been awakened here a little bit as they head into the most important part of the season i think he s the proud football player and anytime you start to be critical of a guy theyre going to prove you wrong sandy boyce on second down and seven <person player="quentin groves" race="nonwhite" position="DE">groves</person> and mandolin players navarro making the stop after a gain of a yard block will continue to tick so the new england patriots are going to go to ten and five jacksonville will drop to eight and seven and virtually there goes <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> he s going to leave a nice standing ovation for him ryan <person player="brian hoyer" race="nonwhite" position="QB">hoyer</person> or lucky out of michigan state will check in <person player="tom brady" race="white" position="QB">brady</person> with a spectacular game you know the relationship between the head coach at a quarterback is probably the most the single most important relationship on a team and those guys are buddies as tight as youre going to find in the league head coaching porter i believe it s very important because who s going to go to the quarterback and say here s what we need you to do and you see is if the codes want to take the quarterback out of the game i think it s okay fortified if you do with the coach thousand visits right no matter where youre playing in a four by <person player="sammy morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">sammy morris</person> big drive right here and look at that score with nine and a half to play and again the significance of that coming into today the patriots at nine and five the bengals at nine and five fighting for that third spot in the afc playoffs both teams coming in with the same record conference records the same six and four coming into today against common opponents to into strength of schedule was the fourth tiebreaker and when you got to that level new england had a slight edge now your wing glenn is going to go to ten and five and cincinnati is fighting just that just to go by a free and then whatever kansas city ballclub on a handoff here on fourth and two it goes to <person player="sammy morris" race="nonwhite" position="RB">morris</person> and then he has stood up by the middle linebacker <person player="gerald alexander" race="UNK" position="DB">gerald</person> levin and i think look at this the the patriots the favors you talked about this of course the patriots could solidify that number three see all right were going to have a change the possession with 29 seconds to play and the patriots recording their tenth win the nfl on cbs is sponsored by four right and wireless america s largest 3g network carscom where confidence comes standard and by td ameritrade a chilly day in foxborough which began with a lot of rain a lot of rain
