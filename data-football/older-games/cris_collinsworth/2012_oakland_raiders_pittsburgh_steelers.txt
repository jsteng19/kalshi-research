they said he must be aware to not overreact to the first lift that the steelers give him at the line of scrimmage the students will change their looks often under defensive coordinator dick lebeau important he said to just react and play he s played against the steelers a lot this is his 14th game against this miss steelers obviously those appearances came as a member of the cincinnati bengals where he was falling inside including a playoff loss on first down slings it seavers falls down and it s intercepted picked off by <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan

player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> and that down the middle was <person player="denarius moore" race="UNK" position="WR">denarius</person> more from the right side of the screen youll see him come in you can see the faeces of <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> and he just slips and falls he saw <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> he was not going to continue deep on his route i think the baseball dirt might have got then there is more there there is no doubt about it lost his footing right where the grass meets the dirt this is also the home of the oakland a s the only stadium that house is both an nfl team and a major league baseball team steelers opening up a first in ten at the oakland 36 yard line <person player="denarius moore" race="UNK" position="WR">moore</person> the intended receiver went down and <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> had it picked off by <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">clark</person> <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> the motion man first play from scrimmage for pittsburgh no store <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> plenty of time throws it a heavy traffic incomplete <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> the intended receiver and mike <person player="miles burris" race="UNK" position="LB">burris</person> the rookie out of san diego state getting a piece of it <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> what a job he did last week distributing the ball in that victory over the new york jets is up to a good start here in 2012 four touchdowns one pick but had his worst game ever here against the raiders six seasons ago four picks in that one but he did talked about the infield dirt yesterday something that he and the steelers have to adjust it may be <person player="denarius moore" race="UNK" position="WR">denarius</person> more has to adjust to it as well steelers first trip to oakland since that game that you meant 22:13 raiders win <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the four picks to four touchdowns <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> what a grab by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> terrific hand when it s ruled incomplete he trapped it itll be third and ten for pittsburgh yeah heck of a attempt by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> as a ball thrown low he hits the ground and right on top of them is <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> im not sure where he lost control of that well check it from this angle and that appears to be a good catch from that angle but maybe this want to be different a little bit of movement there it came out a little bit but i never hit the ground and the town s flag is out by mike tom and i think that s a good call by tomlin we saw the ball come out of his grass but it never hit the ground <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> experienced its challenges railing on the field of an incomplete pass da referee david white boy on the initial look it appeared like he cradled it perfectly textbook as he was going down to the ground he s off to such a great start to this season with a couple of touchdown catches this would be his 12th catch of the season if it s overturned here and that s legal there as the ball goes down to the ground but you can see as he reaches with his left hand keeps the ball off the ground this is going to be an interesting decision for our replay official david white well the nose of the ball definitely hits the ground but the question is does he have control is it considered a cradle for millar <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> telling us that he cant imagine life without <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> he blocks like an offensive lineman he catches the football i can receive her he believes in terms of twoway tight ends that he s the best out there in the nfl with both responsibilities and the judgment here is whether as the nose of the ball hit the ground if he maintained possession while he rolled over we saw that the ball never hit the ground after he willed over but the decision will come and it s going to be very difficult to overturn this i think because the pictures are just inconclusive regardless of all the good looks we have on this because you just cant tell if he has possession throughout the entire play and that s a big part of the equation here because if that s called a clean catch and it s challenged the other way it may have been considered inconclusive and it would have been a completion but the fact of matter as it was incomplete on the field and how the officials would have to look at that video and determine that it was indeed a clean catch a long look under the <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> to remember the replay officials upstairs are the regular replay officials and that is carl matson david white is on a headset with matson is up in the booth and that s an obviously giving white a lot of help on this one this is a very difficult call no matter how you look at it no matter which side of the field you stand up well i tend to think that the longer it takes the better it is for pittsburg who s there trying to determine where theyre going to place the football there it s a normal period that there s nothing normal about these games with the replacement of business so they lose a time out of the process the challenge from mike tomlin itll be third and ten now for the pittsburgh steelers and a four receiver set with wall around <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> and contrary just underway here in the first quarter <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> intercepted by <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> steelers trying to take advantage of that with excellent field position shotguns for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> pocket holds up <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> finds the open man luxury and it comes up short of the first down as he crossed the 30yard line not really looking at the spot and go down as a nine yard gain for the steelers great effort by patchy that try to do everything in his power to pick up this first down zone coverage by the raiders that time you can see when he hit the ground his game up about a yard shy now theyre gonna go forward on fourth and one empty backfield makes you think quarterback sneak with that big guy either that or tried to draw him outsides and kick the field goal blackhawk is down to four <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> a touchback cannon fire lois lois accelerates not across the 10 so they took their time the patience pays off it s 19 yards that s an illegal pick on the outside that the steelers get away with <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> is down he had two coverage that time on <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> and the inside receiver just went out and blocked <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> this is what the problem with the replay efficient replacement officials theyre not used to calling pick plays and a very smart call by todd haley here to pick up the first down this is an oakland offense it is really banged up in the secondary no shawn tei <person player="shawntae spencer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">spencer</person> no wrong bartel <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">huff</person> starting at corner i mean you just dont get that open wide open unless there is something illegal happening here it is right here watch the pick and then <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> comes underneath this is just as blatant as you could possibly get it looked like a shot to the leg of puff who was able to get up on its own and make his way to the raider sideline and how big is an injury to <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> for this raider secondary wording it without shantae <person player="shawntae spencer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">spencer</person> today ron bartel the other starter started this season broke his shoulder he s out for the year <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">huff</person> volunteers to go to the outside the clay corner and on the third play of the game who s injured illegal on an illegal play first and goal from the seven yard one who had been in the backfield with <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> and it will be redmond up the middle yo <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> mike tomlin expects <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> to be back after the bye week which is next week for the steelers and earn a host philadelphia october 7th to yargh a llamar <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> with a stop for oakland will be second and goal from the five ya rettenmund a big thumper along with <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">jonathan dwyer</person> both go about 2:30 we just havent been able to get this running game going the studio has come in as the 30th ranked rushing team in the nfl and oakland comes in 31st pulse is back out there good sign for oakland fourman front working out of the gun <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> steelers look at a strike first it s a handoff to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> he gets stacked up the really develops a <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> on the perimeter antifog <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> came firing through to make the stop there s nothing wrong with the safeties of the raiders <person player="taiwan jones" race="nonwhite" position="RB">taiwan</person> <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> <person player="matt giordano" race="white" position="DB">matt giordano</person> taking the spot of <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> but <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> does a super job to stringing this one out that helped also from the corner on that side with say leo hansen and <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> had nowhere to go seven play the drive third and goal just inside the five <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> throws jerry s got the angle touchdown steelers blossoms burger put it exactly where it had to be for his tight end and pittsburgh is on the board first on the road in oakland and it s just not supposed to be that easy to complete a pass from the fiveyard line to get the guy into the end zone but confusion in the secondary <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">tyvon branch</person> and <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> on that side both took the inside receiver and all set up by the <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> tick on the first play of the game swe s him on for the extra point a 7 play 36 yard drive the touchdown <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> pittsburgh with a 7 to nothing lead on oakland <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> talked about how important it would be to get <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> to the pro bowl watch the safeties here watch <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> come out into the flat theyre both looking for the slant there and wheelers got no chance to stay with <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> so <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> over 27thousand career passing yards he is inching closer to the team record held by terry bradshaw that <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the leading passer in the nfl on third down what was that a third and goal for pittsburgh and that dynamic between <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and todd haley we spoke to <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> about it yesterday he said look change isnt necessarily good or bad it s just different with todd haley it s been really good so far a strong giveandtake theyre both opinionated about passionate are there gonna be some moments over the course of the season that could explode yes i thought it s interesting with tomlin ruth talking about that situation potentially since when i kind of like fiery guy he did say that he likes that about todd and i think he likes the fact that there s a lot of true honesttogoodness passion in that quarter backroom and dialogue swings im kicking off to <person player="mike goodson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike goodson</person> hell take a knee and the oakland raiders will have it at the 20yard line steelers with a 7 anything you need on the raiders 11 33 to play in this first quarter took a look at the starting offense from oakland no khalid <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> <person player="khalif barnes" race="nonwhite" position="OT">barnes</person> is out with a groin injury so <person player="willie smith" race="UNK" position="OT">willie smith</person> in his second year from east carolina former washington redskin picked up off of waivers starter right tackle backs and receivers and it s no secret <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> and the raiders running game pass to get going that has been a huge issue the first two weeks mcfadden has been volved in the passing game but the running game has been nonexistent it s not good one year so mac is your leading receiver as mcfadden is with 15 out of bounds incomplete <person player="denarius moore" race="UNK" position="WR">denarius</person> more the intended receiver <person player="chris carter" race="UNK" position="LB">chris carter</person> the one over there getting a piece for pittsburgh defensively for the steelers the 3/4 set siggy <person player="evander hood" race="nonwhite" position="DT">hood</person> is one of these young steelers that has emerged the 25 year old now in his fourth year linebackers know <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">james harrison</person> once again <person player="chris carter" race="UNK" position="LB">chris carter</person> gets to start there <person player="james harrison" race="nonwhite" position="LB">harrison</person> out with a knee injury and no <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> so <person player="ryan mundy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan mundy</person> is in at safety paul amato missing his second straight game <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> bust right to brandon meyers the tight end <person player="brandon myers" race="white" position="TE">myers</person> has become one of the big targets for <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> here early in the season that covers 16 yards and a new set of downs to work with fer oakland yeah he is their second leading receiver that s his close of the season now the raiders looking to up tempo of this game trying to get into some type of rhythm go right to the line of scrimmage mcfadden sets up as a receiver now he shifts to the backfield the clock is down to four palma made a change of the line of scrimmage mcfadden takes it the distance 64 yards theyve been waiting for it there s own block for 54 yards in the previous two games but this was a classic songwriting play off the right side behind <person player="willie smith" race="UNK" position="OT">willie smith</person> mike brazell and the center was no ski and near the speed of mcfadden we gotta hold your breath when he has the ball he can go the distance at any time and he outran this second area of the steelers <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> changing the play they shift to a running play as <person player="sebastian janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> adds the extra point and just like that the oakland raiders got tie this one up we have packed a lot in to a short period of time in this opening quarter so far nikita may this blocking is the watch the back side here by <person player="cooper carlisle" race="white" position="OG">cooper</person> carlyle as mcfadden very patiently waits for the hole to open up the block right there seals the nose tapped on the linebacker and then a poor angle by ryan monday when the fadden out runs <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> to the pylon but it s so important this is the fifth different combination that the raiders have had up front as an offensive line because of injury in throughout the preseason and the first governor games of the regular season gregg knapp their offensive coordinator talks about they need patience pavin rissalah we got a great deal 64yard beauty buy his first carry of the game <person player="darren mcfadden" race="nonwhite" position="RB">darren mcfadden</person> 11 carries for 22 yards last week in the loss to miami as we mentioned earlier he has been heavily involved in the passing game at 15 message 405 yards through the first two weeks but the topic of conversation the last couple of days here at oakland has been his mcfadden a good fit for this own blocking scheme we asked <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> s thermic fans a good fit for any running style or skate be just that good <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> the return man he slips down just short of the 20yard line so the pittsburgh steelers offense back on the field and let s take a look at their starters up front last week it was marquise bouncies twin brother mike who went against the oakland raiders defense as a member of the miami dolphins county one of the best in the business twotime pro bowler backs and receivers for pittsburgh <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> actually was banged up this week rib injury was able to plow through it during practice and make the trip out here and all a huge factor <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> here in oakland said it s a hostile environment but i have a lot of respect for these fans i know how passionate they are jumpoff catch made by <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> and the <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> is hit just across the 20 by <person player="rolando mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">rolando mcclain</person> brants came out of there with a football and then diked the former steeler it should say injury for the raiders <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben roethlisberger</person> taken a hit at the end of this play no flag was thrown that was one more <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> <person player="isaac redman" race="UNK" position="RB">redman</person> of the backfield on a second and six play fake point bends sells it perfectly almost intercepted <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">philip wheeler</person> the former indianapolis colt got his hands on it that s what the raiders will try to do today is give <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">ben</person> a lot of different looks at the line of scrimmage and then bail out and play zone this is a very successful ploy by dennis allen last season as defensive coordinator with the broncos and see the fans know what happened in that game nine plays for pittsburgh seven passes to running and now a third and six for the steelers 937 to play in this actionpacked first quarter around the motion man to pittsburgh working from the gun pump walker s burger low throw <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> there and a clean catch for <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> covers 16 yards theyll move the chains that s what <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> does better than anybody else in the game buy that extra one or two seconds in the pocket to find his receiver over the middle <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">wallace</person> does a super job of going down low and about where the second baseman would play and scooping that ball up 16 yards on the game kind of quiets a crowd too well the crowd has been into it from the very story three receivers set on first down for pittsburgh <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> tried the quick hitter to send as we talked about the fact that dennis allen did a terrific job last year as defensive coordinator for the denver broncos defending <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> that is our fox focus here now the key is to get big been given different looks the blitz look here makes him think about throwing the deep against the mantoman once the ball is snapped the broncos drop into a zone they rushed only four they stayed in their lanes and contained <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> five cents and a pittsburgh loss was a result were seeing a lot so far today by the radar secondary on second down for the stairs my clock down to two didnt go down on first contact he s going to be short of the first down as <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> was the one chasing him from behind mar <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> s a big guy 6foot 3 300 <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is 6 5 241 and he went down hard on both his knees after <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> tripped him up from behind great effort to try to get to the first down but sets up a an optional type of claw here a lot of options for <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> and todd haley im claritin short dennis allen turned 14 yesterday head coach of the raiders young this is a third and manageable two yards <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> set it up to the outside center has got the catch and the first down and reading into oakland territory for a pickup of eight on the play defensively for the oakland raiders <person player="matt shaughnessy" race="UNK" position="DE">matt shaughnessy</person> 26th birthday today had a sack last week in that loss to miami linebackers lana <person player="rolando mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> suffered a concussion in that game there s a question mark this week but passed all the tests and he s been in there for the raiders so far and in that secondary we told you help banged up they are no <person player="shawntae spencer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">spencer</person> today so <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">huff</person> shifting over to corner and <person player="matt giordano" race="white" position="DB">matt giordano</person> getting the start at safety clay block was perfect it s got a deep wall rustle down but he does get enough for the first down to the 35 11 new york mclain the first man there and the swarm of raiders defenders following and the steelers gave the raiders a heavy run look with three tight ends <person player="leonard pope" race="UNK" position="TE">leonard</person> poked <person player="david paulson" race="UNK" position="TE">david paulson</person> joined <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> the playaction been looking to go deep again but the raiders again more zone here not allowing the deep pass but not allowing the deep pass gave up the first down pass to the outside on the previous play when my club was playing about ten yards off the receiver not a whole lot of pressure on <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> so far he 7 of 11 71 yards on the touchdown the <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> all tied up steelers and raiders down the sideline <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> a lot of people around the league were surprised when he got that extensions five years forty two million dollars but you talked to mike tomlin and what does he focus in on his preparation the way that he conducts himself and obviously the attitude the steelers believe it now i thought was interesting when he s talking about brown who s on the practice squad how running routes against <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> every day made <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> the cornerback for the steelers a better player he is right now just schooling <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">huff</person> playing off now he decides to come up and play bat mantoman bump and run which is a good idea that was a lot of scout team for brown when he first came into the league out of central michigan handoff it s <person player="jonathan dwyer" race="UNK" position="RB">dwyer</person> dwyre pushed backward for the forward progress well get him three yards <person player="lamarr houston" race="nonwhite" position="DT">houston</person> <person player="rolando mcclain" race="nonwhite" position="LB">mcclain</person> <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> ball in there for oakland and in talking to <person player="michael huff" race="nonwhite" position="DB">michael huff</person> yesterday about the switch to corner he said hed rather play bump and run because he s a big physical type of guy and so far i think that playing off has hurt the raiders and made it difficult to stop <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> that s berg in the red zone once again second and seven now for the steelers without a 524 to go in this fastpaced first ward take

<person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> right here and then just release to the inside nobody home because of the playaction fake which to me is kind of interesting because the steelers arent running the ball worth the darn and yet the linebackers for the raiders still have to respect the run when theyre opening up huge holes in the secondary for time and <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> s career he s had two touchdowns in a game i dont know if he s ever had them quite this quickly 349 to play in this first quarter

<person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> is that even in practice if he drops the ball the players it s so unusual everybody will laugh and hell take responsibility you know i cant do that im sorry baba and even if he s wide open in the game wholl never say he was wide open to that which is very unusual for receiver the pens just singing the praises of keith <person

live at 3 oclock eastern college football today right here on cbs ill be interesting to see what answers the raiders have for the steeler offense with great field position to start this drive raiders desperately need to hold the steelers they could not afford to have things continued this way steelers have done whatever they wanted to in this first quarter offensively injury for oakland mike <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> knee injury his return as probable play fake <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white"

position="QB">roethlisberger</person> wisely threw it away about the nohuddle it s something you talked about a great length with russel berger who really likes it and feels like the offense can thrive in it yeah i mean most corner tracks whod like to call their own plays and in the no huddle that s not the situation normally is mike he s a too often he believes it loses some of its effectiveness flat comes down and this play never happens and part of that losing an effectiveness rijkaard <person player="doug legursky" race="white" position="C">doug</person> will wont <person player="ramon foster" race="nonwhite" position="OT">foster</person> and the quarterback has to call plays in the line of scrimmage so some of your key words may be intercepted by the defense team scout not only a tape of the report but to audio tapes as well so they can hear the cadence they can hear the key words and then match them up to the place so too much of the no huddle could be a bad thing tomlin said he likes it when the offense needs a shot in the arm obviously they do not need a shot anywhere on there now the way that they played in this first quarter on offense talk play and big bottle buffy and the 42yard line but a penalty marker on the plate throwing back at the pittsburgh 45 a 7 yard game and definitely holding against the steelers and it s willie cologne who was formerly at right tackle for the steelers now starting at left guard he was on injured reserve last year with a tricep injury here he is right here and it s a drop play to redmond and he just reaches

<person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> s run is to the right side here good call by our officials and serves right fit was clearly out of bounds but it s more concerning for the raiders is how wide open <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> was on that sideline safety late coming over not enough contact

pastime you wont find anyplace else it s inside the nfl and it s wednesday on showtime now the steelers defense just hasnt been on the field very often the raiders have only run seven plays so if youre a trips berg defensive player on the bench you can get into some deep conversations seven plays six passes one run the one round one 464 yards so maybe you should run the ball more if youre the raiders 117 total yards for pittsburgh 74 oakland most of it coming on the this is a third in 25 after the timeout raucous burger set up the screen <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK"

everybody involved and that s something like tomlin said maybe people around the nfl dont necessarily look at pittsburgh as one of the deepest offenses in the league but you start looking at their roster i got a lot of pieces that can do a lot of damage right and when you talk to opposing coaches especially the defensive side the first thing they talked about obviously is <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> extending plays and then the ability to find these speedy wide receivers steelers are unique in the fact that they only employ four wide receivers for each game <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> jerico khatri <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike

position="QB">roethlisberger</person> to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> we talked about the pittsburgh side of things for oakland there s no doubt that there s some uneasiness in the bay area when you get a new regime new general manager reggie mckenzie comes over from green bay the director of player personnel with the packers philemon raider played a large packers spot for oakland back in the 80s so he takes over he makes his big hire dennis allen the former defensive coordinator in denver now this is a team that showed flashes last year and they were seven and fourth and a one game lead in the afc west people thought maybe this team was ready to turn the corner and it did not end well for oakland last season denver emerges in that division they end up getting the playoff win over pittsburgh and oakland s still looking for its first win of the dennis allen era shotguns okay gets a little bit incomplete took a shot from <person player="larry foote" race="nonwhite" position="LB">larry</person> foot get you up to speed on where we are at <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> to <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> that s the touchdown that got hits burg on the board then mcfadden raiders fans have been waiting for this pitch that knee gets the crease and turns it into seven eight but then waffles berger orchestrates another impressive drive for pittsburgh and it s <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> again for his second touchdown of the day and really that run by mcfadden is all the raiders can show for their offense so far another pot for molecular <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> waiting for high flat down 12 that a jute mills takes it to the outside another penalty marker 73 yards for pittsburgh and a touchdown two different flags on the play yeah one flag thrown where the gunner was trying to get down the field may have been held by the steelers both these calls may go against pittsburgh nullifying a fabulous punt return by <person player="antonio brown" race="nonwhite" position="WR">antonio brown</person> the second flag you can almost predict where it was thrown and when it was thrown that it s going to be an illegal block against the steelers brown went to the pro bowl last year as a return man electrifying skills such a big play threat when he gets the ball in his hands he s so smooth he s so fast and his desire you can see the work ethic in his return how he s always looking to get down the field get extra yards it s over here from david white this one s coming back daler 10 that was illegal block in the back under 13 thank you those holding on return team sang the kid tried to return that penalty will be enforced from the end of the kick first man so that wasnt the initial flag that came down theyll take the whole day well take a break early second quarter now in the circle is seven where the holding will caught to happen <person player="robert golden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">robert</person> gol <person player="robert golden" race="nonwhite" position="DB">golden</person> number 30 and also cortes out in the couple of youngsters holding on mike <person player="michael mitchell" race="UNK" position="DB">mitchell</person> here that gets the first flag so steelers get it back touchdown is nullified from brown on the return first down for pittsburgh and back up the middle theyre looking for something here in the running game if it s not redmond wire batch <person player="chris rainey" race="UNK" position="RB">chris rainey</person> s been in there again no <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">rashard mendenhall</person> recovering from that torn acl that he suffered on january the first in the regular season finale but mike tomlin feels very confident after watching <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> in practice this week that the bye week comes next week and the following game he expects to have <person player="rashard mendenhall" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mendenhall</person> back in there he got some good work in practice they dumped him a little bit in practice and he responded well second and eight after the 2 yard pickup <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> and koch the tight ends <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> sets up as a receiver rakesh berger locks in on <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> catch made out across the 25 a sevenyard pickup the linebacker <person player="phillip adams" race="UNK" position="DB">phillip</person> <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wheeler</person> bringing them down that s a mismatch regardless of who s out there on the outside a linebacker here in <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">wheeler</person> against <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">heath miller</person> this is no contest though you could do that all day long third and short for pittsburgh a lot of confusion on that raider defense says theyre all trying to communicate pointing around look at this <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> is waiting for them to settle down zig call the play play talk down the water barreling through for a first down she needed a yard picked up three this drive will continue for the steelers oakland s banged up there s certainly been an issue in the secondary with bartel placed on ir he is actually eligible to come off they designated him as a player that could come back from that shoulder injury <person player="shawntae spencer" race="nonwhite" position="DB">spencer</person> s out with a foot injury bhosale johansson signed with the team from philadelphia and pat <person player="patrick lee" race="UNK" position="DB">lee</person> signed from green bay former secondround pick back in 2008 out of auburn first down it s batch getting another chance up the middle second year throw on it texas tech on a torn acl last year and they limit batch to a two yard game because of those injuries in the secondary obviously that steelers are more interested in throwing the ball today theyve run 26 plays 18 of them have been cast placed losses per they have time to throw is completed 12 of those 18 for 124 yards already the twoyard gain on first down pittsburgh is last in the afc and yards per play on first down so far this young season just three point three seven yards on first down poised but weve seen them pass me off and on first out and but the time he s got slings it over to johnson <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> theyre very high on him comparing him to oakland s <person player="marcel reece" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marcel reece</person> the fact that he s so versatile a fullback out of west virginia but they didnt really play in traditional fullback at west virginia so he had to learn a lot of different skills well and you can see the skills that he has with that diving catch very difficult catch over the middle but johnson made it look easy that s his third catch of the season great versatile player there other h back david johnson no relation went on ir with a knee injury and it s <person player="will johnson" race="UNK" position="RB">will johnson</person> who s got an opportunity and he s made the most of it third and four for pittsburgh you lay a game so back it up for the sealers that s just losing focus there by <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> the clocks are a very evident the play clock is staring in the face and for him not to see that instead of a third down play selection here where you can run or pass move it back now and it s obvious passing situation for penalties called against pittsburgh boston the steelers 30 yards the raiders are yet to have a penalty called against them weve got 10:35 to go on his first half pittsburgh with a 147 lead third and nine <person player="ben roethlisberger" race="white" position="QB">roethlisberger</person> shotgun slopes line launched it at the end im gonna say he was down before the ball came out this might be challenged by the raiders steelers know that theyre trying to get to the line of scrimmage is going to play off before their goes to challenge flight by dennis allen this challenge by allen because the receiver has to be able to control the ball throughout the completion of the play and i dont think <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> did that great effort by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> oakland is challenging the really on the field of a complete path <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> in the matchup with <person player="philip wheeler" race="nonwhite" position="LB">philip wheeler</person> who was scraping at the football boy that looks like a clean catch and down by contact well find out so the question here does he complete the catch and the answer is no because the ball will come out the rule is you must complete the catch all the way and you can see the ball comes out of those he does go to the ground that s what the official saw it first the ball was kind of shielded from the official that made the call by <person player="heath miller" race="white" position="TE">miller</person> s body challenged by the raiders this should be overturned this was a long review after review the sabre did not mean controlling the ball through contact 340 yards so dennis allen okay david well do that dennis allen s instincts were correct and foul his instincts were correct and the raiders making a case for themselves right away time on <person player="tyvon branch" race="white" position="DB">branch</person> the officials after taking a look agree and assistant al saunders up in the box that s his job is to take a look at the replays former head coach of the san diego chargers he advised alan to throw that challenge flag and steelers kind of gave it away then tie was incomplete away they hustled the line of scrimmage and alan had to throw it quickly because when they tried to sneak a play in <person player="drew butler" race="white" position="P">butler</person> comes off the side of his foot the rookie did not get all of that one pittsburgh with a 14 to 7 lead over oakland now fitting that we would be doing the raiders and the steelers when talking about steve sabol pioneer and a true giant sable woke the autumn wind is a pirate blustering in

position="QB">roethlisberger</person> he s got such great feel for the pocket escape ability and then when you get to him it s tough to bring him down he s 250 pounds or so then this allen says were trying to get to his right arm because if we just try to tackle him he s strong enough to spin away and get the ball off similar to what he did that time to find redmond over the middle danni wins

s getting back and getting rid of the ball quickly the receivers are getting into their routes and making the catch on the other end <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> came into this week leading the afc in passing yards but he s been held 258 here this afternoon 3rd and 1 for oakland seven play of the drive schmidt in front of mcfadden now they crowd the line handoff mcfadden mcfadden sticks the helmet down keeps on going first down raiders just inside the 5yard line under eight minutes to go now on the third tenpoint lead for pittsburgh but mcfadden kinda was laying on top of <person player="brett keisel" race="white" position="DE">brett keisel</person> right here watch this play in the awareness by mcfadden to realize his knee never touched down so he put his right hand down on the ground and got the extra yardage down to the five headsup play by mcfadden realizing he was never down no whistle first down raiders hayward they back in head off mcfadden spins so let the individual effort by mcfadden for the score you know his 64yard it was something but i like this one even better because this is all about effort and desire as he just would not be denied in atlantis the line of scrimmage spins off then extends just enough to get it to the goal line this one will be reviewed because it is a scoring play but you got to love that effort as me was not down that s a touchdown great effort on backtoback plays by mcfadden <person player="ryan mundy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mundy</person> and <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> had an opportunity to bring him down before the goal line and mcfadden just kept on coming there s a hit by <person player="keenan lewis" race="nonwhite" position="DB">lewis</person> that s a touchdown that s his knee hit the ground that ball was touching the goal line were taking a look at it 24:20 right now pittsburgh matter upon further review this is not a touchdown knees are up but the elbow is down ball is short of the goal line will be raider ball inches away at the review the runners not the obamas down short of the goal line the ball will be placed second and goal at the 1 foot line great effort by mcfadden you can see the left elbow clearly down in the ball just inches shy our camera is right on the goal line it s a good use of the replay by our officials and that s why each scoring play is reviewed so itll be second and goal for oakland inside the one mcfadden had the 64 yard touchdown run in the first quarter came inches away from his second touchdown of the day three tight ends in this formation second and goal for on again mcfadden runs into a brick mill and a loss on the play i just dont understand that call youre literally two inches from the goal line your quarterback is six five 235 how about the good old quarterback sneak here you take the ball back away from the line of scrimmage penetration and now weve got a steeler hurt at the bottom of that pile but i just dont understand that call at all when youre so close to the goal line injury on the play <person player="will allen"

janikowski" race="white" position="K">janikowski</person> onside ricochets outofbounds penalty marker thrown kickoff at it bans is a penalty but the steelers can take this ball where it goes out of bounds theyll have great field position regardless trying to catch the steelers offguard on special teams and it backfires the officials huddle up steelers offense is on the field the raiders defense on the field look like <person player="mike goodson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">mike goodson</person> had a real good shot at this ball but couldnt come up with it and then the ball took a crazy bounce and went out of bounds but perfectly executed by janakowski steelers were totally fooled now it s a free kick out of back on the kicking team ball will be placed where the ball went out of bounds first down now that s a gamble by the rookie head coach that doesnt pay off but not because of just poor execution watch <person player="mike goodson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">goodson</person> there has the ball go right through his hands before france seeds can come over and keep it in bounds so pittsburgh has it at the oakland 48 yard line dennis allen former defensive coordinator with denver was with new orleans atlanta at the university of tulsa texas a&amp;m where he played safety for the aggies a twoyear starter his dad grady played a linebacker for atlanta in the nfl from 68 to 72 and then the first defensive oriented head coach for the raiders since john madden and that goes way back madden of course was an offensive lineman in his playing days so he wasnt totally on the defensive side although he did coach on both sides of the ball early in his career so again this is an extended scenario for the officials and look who s here is the great coach the halloffamer really the standard for all of us analysts that we try to emulate nobody did it better than john madden nice to refer to him as the babe ruth football analyst i think that s fair is he waving to catch her attention okay i think it s a flight coming in the black hole of oakland but raiders fans young and old on hand for this pittsburgh oakland battle 24 21 steelers in

was contact with <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ike taylor</person> and the raiders fans looking for a flag let s check it out on the side here that s the illegal contact down the field there i mean how can you not call that youre standing right there as an official who cannot touch the receiver past five yards <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> gets away with that one before that incomplete <person player="ike taylor" race="nonwhite" position="DB">taylor</person> <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> it completed eight in a row paul on the other side when we talked to <person player="mike wallace" race="nonwhite" position="WR">mike wallace</person> about what he has thought with the officials he said look defensive players are definitely pushing the envelope but you just have to go out and play football you cant worry about third and nine power here today watch streeter the rookie and he got his bell rung at the end of the play but he secured the football for a first down mama took a pretty good shot in the pocket is he hung in there waiting for streeter to get down the field 17 yards on the play and a big first down for oakland street are getting himself to his feet as the medical staff takes a look youre watching the nfl on cbs home of super bowl xlvii double rookie s battling here streeter is going to beat <person player="cortez allen" race="UNK" position="DB">cortez allen</person> and then luis comes in inadvertently hits streeter in the face with his left hand and that s why streeter went to the sidelines <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> takes his shot here as <person player="lamarr woodley" race="nonwhite" position="DE">woodley</person> drives <person player="willie smith" race="UNK" position="OT">willie smith</person> back into his quarterback do center for oakland hook it up hey word bae a collision ryan monday just laid him out ball was just a little bit late hayward base still down in the back of the end zone because it hit by monday ball thrown a little bit sooner by <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">palmer</person> would have been a touchdown as hayward bay got inside luis fans booing cuz theyre seeing the replay as monday make contact with his helmet to the facemask of heyward pay darius heyward bae theyre checking him out in the endzone beautiful spot at oakland lake merritt steelers leading the raiders 31 to 21 early stages fourth quarter and concern right now for darius heyward bae he took a big hit from <person player="ryan mundy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan mundy</person> who launched at payard bay and they have brought the card out in the nfl they take every precaution in situations like this yeah his helmet definitely hit hayward bay in the facemask in the helmet and looked like hayward bay may have been knocked out before even hit the ground and he did hit the ground hard so this is a compounding type of injury that which surprises me is that the officials again missed that call he could not hit a defenseless receiver like that and not draw a penalty but look we know there s been a lot of talk this week about the replacement officials after what happened monday night in my only concern now doing all these preseason games regularseason a bunch of games television and radio you dont want this situation for these replacement officials to be something that theyre checking off their bucket list that theyre hey im happy to be here and great to be a part of it you still got to go out and make calls youre a part of the game it s a difficult situation any labor issues always going to be difficult to figure out i mean it comes down to dollars and cents but in this case to me it doesnt quite make sense lundi having a chat with <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> and concern on both sides steelers and raiders as they tend to darius hayward bay now he went down in a heap almost like a boxer getting one right on the kisser when he s unconscious before he hits the canvas so a stoppage here 1431 mark of the fourth quarter with the steelers in front 31 to 21 darius heyward bae the fourthyear receiver last year we really saw his ability to stretch the field became more of an impact player <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> among those kneeling and focusing on hayward bay and making every moment count here the medical staff just to make sure it s handled correctly this is something that leaguewide weve seen over the last 12 13 years the improvement and the uniformity in every stadium handling injuries and you know i as a player this could happen at any time to any player sure and that you have that understanding going into each and every game you hate to see it obviously but it s a part of the game it will always be a part of the game it s a violent game played by big athletic fast players and it just happens ryan monday the 4th year pro who has seen the extended action because of injuries to <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> <person player="ryan clark" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ryan clark</person> missing week 1 in denver

player="ryan mundy" race="nonwhite" position="DB">mundy</person> gets the start that was a hard hit i think both you and i agree there should have been a flag on the play but all the concern right now is just for the wellbeing of darius hayward bay <person player="troy polamalu" race="nonwhite" position="DB">troy polamalu</person> sitting out his second consecutive game with a calf injury he s dennis allen on the right side of the picture very concerned obviously players and fans reacting these moments you just want to see a positive sign of some sort now <person player="carson palmer" race="white" position="QB">carson palmer</person> is making his way over there along with <person player="marcel reece" race="nonwhite" position="WR">marcel reece</person> tereus hayward bay now

third down and short steelers at 75 yards rushing week 1 against denver 66 yards rushing last week against the jets they have 48 yards on the ground here today and the other thing i added if they dont
