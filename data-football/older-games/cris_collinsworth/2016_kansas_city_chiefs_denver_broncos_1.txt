kicking team can yard therapy could be fourth down that s a big one to take away that terrific punter wellcovered capri bibs in the running back was the man guilty of the hold that baby again yeah right at the tail end of this thing really unnecessarily bibs is gonna pull his guy to the ground here looked like he was in good position and then just right there you can see yanking him to the ground no way they were gonna come around the edge and block that kick what a big change of field position that could possibly be because that was a great punt <person player="riley dixon"

second here by his toenails i was looking at the rest of it and there was no way the punter was gonna pull him down <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">dixon</person> that was a touchdown saver right there by <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> hill has been a player who has changed the scope of his chiefs team really giving them a lot of a dynamic look here the <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">dixon</person> on that first pump had the pin back to the floor but because of that penalty the retake the chiefs

position="P">dustin colquitt</person> remember his brother britton used to kick here in denver now kicking with the browns the job fielding that snap he s able to get it away bori aint on the kick was

you by bmw we only make one thing the ultimate driving machine by ge we imagine a better world then make it real on blue cash every day card from american express by rogue one a star wars story in theaters december 60 downtown denver omelet up from union station which has had a great transformation to city hall as last night but our friday nights is a grand elimination see only three games that blue subtract what day of the week it is let s see on the clock look what youve done to me each team three and out to start drive two for the broncos clubs with 13 yards on that carry for devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> chris we talk about good defense it s a pass rush against covering this guy s been one of the best corners in the league in his first two years in the league you know it s just amazing how many times he gets his hands on the football five interceptions three fumble recoveries a couple of big moments already but probably takes as many chances in coverage as any quarterback i have ever watched so you will see greatness out of them youll see him give up some big plays but it s a very exciting watch for <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> back to the ground back to <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> to the left yards theyre the 18th yard line you saw the <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> has five interceptions it was tied for the league lead to start this week <person player="casey kreiter" race="UNK" position="C">casey</person> heyward from san diego had one today so he has six as marcus will need to grab one to get back on top of that list well he has a quarterback rating against him of just 64 which is eighth best in the league but he s also given up over 500 yards receiving which is the 12th most so youre getting a gift with him bob something the defensive coordinator really can do different things when you have <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> and getting him back off that game he missed with the hip injury so important for <person player="casey kreiter" race="UNK" position="C">casey</person> third fork city of is pressure he s pulled down by <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> speaking of getting guys back in the lineup and it makes a difference in your defense well <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> we talked about him early on and this is going to be a long night for the denver broncos if they dont get better play out of the right tackle position theyve been playing <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson there he went to the bench hi sam brillo comes in sam brillo has struggled this season trying to get past protection so for <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> he could end up having a big night tonight and he has already started that way last week for his game bag injuries kept him out this time reilly <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">dixon</person> does not hit as good a punt is a big directional kicking night that midfield that will bounce out of bounds so they very good field position for kansas city but the bowling 35 yards and put number 50 back of the lineup for the chiefs it s a big difference <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> with the sack wherever you are dont miss a moment of tonight s game the npc sports app you can watch the game anywhere live on your laptop tablet they can connect to tvs the directional kick was not kicked far enough that his <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> of the chiefs and what should be a lowscoring game a great advantage field position starting at midfield they complete to <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> the tight end who couldnt hang on let s meet this very good denver defense their full cincinnati <person player="sylvester williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">sylvester williams</person> north carolina jerry creek nebraska paul <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> takes is a no <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon marshall</person> laverne ty davis sacramento state <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> troy i cant leave kansas <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> morgan <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darian stewart</person> south carolina <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> jr casas james horner rankings are so good with pro football focus numbers and theyre really good safety plays with solid you can see why those teams carried by defenses tyreke hill using his speed to get a halfdozen on the past smith it sets up 34 well there s no doubt youre going to see a lot of these short quick passes tonight out of <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> he does it anyway but when youre playing against this denver broncos defense it s always a good idea to get the ball out of your hand so theyre trying to go with some of that misdirection stuff early on now a little better situation here third and four and this is the time now that <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> becomes such a big part of this offense he is the goto guy to leave at the top of your screen remember he missed the prior three games lower backings really see if they test him at some point tonight smith will test to lead with hill and to lead is ready blanketed the receiver penalty marker down low in the secondary maya scrimmage the 45 flag is down at the 35 to lead passed the test holding number 25 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down other corner <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> chris hair is clearly one of the best slot cornerbacks in the game right now and theyre going to get called for a hold on that one and to leave at the top of your screen running with a guy that runs a four to five and stride for stride so i would say he s healthy maybe gas hits coming back hell take a break punch to the top of the screen to the 41 to the left to <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were close to the 35yard line it s a good gain of about four yards there on first down now <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where s a guy that was a high school quarterback and a good one and went to lsu to do the same kind of became a running back and i said well what did you have to learn when youre to play running baggies that i had to learn to be a whole lot tougher was they had to crank it up a little bit playing running back excellent receiver coming out of the backfield 641 yards because the chiefs without jamal <person player="jamaal charles" race="nonwhite" position="RB">charles</person> reserve with his knee problem so where has become the main back and he has a kansas city first down around the 28 yard line i always thought one of the best players on kansas city s team was their fullback <person player="anthony sherman" race="white" position="RB">anthony sherman</person> he just has a knack for being able to find his way into the gap and you can tell right now that <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were just totally trust him get right behind him get as close as you can and then make that cut and that s when you get that great confidence thing going as a running back when you dont have to think so much just trust that fullback he s a guy who never carries the ball you work through the passing game of it one purpose in the one game and he does it well and to the backfield for smith from the 28 yard line has to get away from the shack <person player="shaquil barrett" race="UNK" position="LB">barrett</person> brush rows it away incomplete one of the interesting matchups tonight is going to be <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> right here this time working against shaq <person player="shaquil barrett" race="UNK" position="LB">barrett</person> <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> when he s playing for cleveland is one of the few guys that ever had a good day against <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> and i think it had a lot to do <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> dont you with the fact that he s here they said they went back and really studied that tape and <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> had his best day or one of his best days against the grapevine <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> they said well we just got a secret twice a year let s bring him on in they did it was a major moneymaking day for <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">schwartz</person> that was never missed a snap as he s gone through the first now five years of his nfl career you better put the pressure on there and its second attempt getting lucky track down his hill gets from the 15yard line so a guilty <person player="billy turner" race="nonwhite" position="OT">turner</person> i looked from <person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert</person> wilts in the receiver number 12 for kansas city wondering if he was involved maybe in pass interference pass interference number 12 offense 10yard penalty remains second down youre good making contact within one yard but once <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> backed up and then he stayed on it if that contact had been made within one yard of the line of scrimmage youre allowed to sort of follow through with that block but it was clearly a couple yards beyond that very close tough call but that s one of the techniques i think you just would have to know about harris s he s going to back out of there just a bit is that what you love about football all right so all these receivers are blocking okay fine were going to use it against you now <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> counterpunch that s right nile davis member he was traded to <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> bay we may got rid of him wave to me back with the chief said he s in the backfield on second and 20 smith threw for kelsey incomplete and meaning at the quarterback the pressure came on from <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> and <person player="todd davis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">todd davis</person> the inside backer when the pressure came from the linebacker position that meant <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> had to block down and that meant nobody black <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> and guess who paid the price for that <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> anytime you get a holding call or a tackle for loss and you end up i dont think theyre even remotely thinking about the first down theyre gonna try and get ten yards and get the deal go great report 13:20 place going nuts smith times the crusher incomplete for wilson blanketed by <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> jr from here a field goal to be 56 yards for kara <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> just the great defensive stand there you get the short putt it looks like kansas city s got a little something going and then they get the hold and move them right back out of field goal range youre going to punt it the career long 54 we didnt mention the wind a bit of a factor tonight although not as much as it was pregame but this a game it s a lot about field position <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">dustin colquitt</person> would try to do his part for the chiefs so itd be a net of 18 so kansas city got the ball midfield had a little bit go until they said a bat remember how great the chiefs were the end of last year they won their last ten so take you with this year s ten games there s seventeen and three the last 20 best in the nfl and theyve got a formula they know who they are 16 points per game best in the league they take it away from you most in the league over that 20 game stretch and they take care of the ball so the turnover margin is in their favor so much is about how do you sell how do you market know who you are you and the chiefs know exactly who they are an ad read when it s best everybody buys into what our style of football is first down for simeon his passing complete was intended for emanuel <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> away in the flag thrown with phillip gains in coverage molding number 23 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down they ask a lot of these quarterbacks this time <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">phillip gaines</person> gonna go oneonone against one of the quickest wide receivers you will ever see and just a little grab on the top end of that route and that was enough of the flag there and chris that s such an important part of what youre talking about with both of these teams they the offenses are okay because they understand were playing to the strength of our team the defense and dont you think what denver did winning the super bowl last year confirmed for <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> im good playing thisll absolutely the three bibs is the back its first in ten out and it s a second first out of the game one for denver and won by the pass to <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> working on games youll see <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">phillip gaines</person> set way outside and look in at the quarterback he s as much looking at the quarterback is he is the wide receiver in that position unfortunately by taking that position youre also leaving open to slant the advantage <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> a team of the mixes hurt was pushing and shoving behind the play not related to the hit on bids who is still down and the denver athletic training staff out to see the second year running back from colorado state <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> came up with a big lick the capri bibs took a really tough hit from <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> just set up i have 30 seconds ago and then they walked him off to the sideline here s the hit you could see he got tripped up first byram ich wilson and then <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">berry</person> was coming up to make the hit and i think he was as surprised as anybody that <person player="kapri bibbs" race="UNK" position="RB">bibbs</person> ended up being that low to the ground and they both has collided to the unaffiliated neurological consulted on the sidelines assisting me athletic training staff the broncos as they assess bibs we have a flag down here before second and 35 yards farther back and pips false start number ten offense fiveyard penalty still second down just gonna say bibs is was going to get a lot more action here tonight they had done some self scouting during the bye week and devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> they sat her called him into the room and said hey we need you to break some more tackles look at this you tell me could you do more and bibs was gonna pick up some of that load but now it may end up landing on <person player="juwan thompson" race="UNK" position="RB">juwan thompson</person> who s active for the game tonight so on second and eight after the penalty simeon throws theyre working <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> over on that left side of the offense <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth acker</person> in there on coverage and itll be a yarder so short of the first down again all the technology to make sure the players get the best medical care the opportunity to look at the head just to assess what happened to bibs on the play so they can go into the diagnosis phase and everything else medically with a lot more information available to them it s good stuff they really advance that cause a long way from the days when i was playing i am just touching the old three fingers thing you got within five you got back in 32 the gun with bunker and kansas city is there to stop it ricky nina s brooch s comes up with the tackle his play has been improving for this chase defense that will send the punt unit on for denver des roches just basically blew this i almost ran right by the ball carrier he got so much penetration able to come out the last minute in <person player="max garcia" race="UNK" position="C">max garcia</person> his strength really is his run blocking and what a play by nunez roach s <person player="max garcia" race="UNK" position="C">garcia</person> right back that s the second time the broncos have been stopped on third and one <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley dixon</person> to try to pin the hill back there catch the 12 yard love much of 42 as forecast defenses dominated let s see what jimmy has all new this week balance to the local jj abrams and stone natalie portman chelsea handler icet and john legend it s a great week tonight show starring jimmy fallon all new all week here on nbc geez take over at their own 13 scoreless with three minutes left in the first in <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were with a very good first down run it s the one thing that s been troubling about this denver defense they be giving up more run yards than last year whereas this whole group is put together by the oneofakind wade <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> age 69 almost four decades in the nfl is 25th years the defensive coordinator and any time you talk to wade <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> you come away learning about a little defense and you come away smile he s one of the great guys in the league i usually come away laughs if he can tell some stories in the day 93 94 ian s the broncos head coach ill be <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> first <person player="adam gotsis" race="UNK" position="DT">adam</person> or <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> and he kelsey him this thing theyve abandoned lee love going up against one another but the tackles meet after the first down at the 35 yard line the gain of 15 it is pretty incredible to watch <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> get back on a play like this and make a play in the open field against one of the guys that i think is one of the best route runners at the tight end position that ive seen in a long time of course kansas city fans will say there s at least one other one i can think of it s pretty good but he really is very talented even against quarterbacks he makes big plays and gets open the quarterback d<person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert wilson</person> the gain of almost schoolyards as <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> takes him to the sideline yet tony gonzales right a good pattern or two in his day he wasnt too bad but you know were seeing the formula at kansas city chiefs are using the formula that several other teams have used you dont want to face those pass rushers so theyre putting in full backs theyre putting in an extra tight in theyre putting in two extra tight ends theyre putting in an extra offensive lineman and trying to play big boy football against them once again here they go with the <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon marshall</person> the line back if the broncos trying to get them organized those shifts in the formations where it comes back in the backfield and spence aware takes the carry hell be a couple of yards short of the first down you know this is a defense though with denver that s giving up an extra 40 yards per game on the ground over what they were a season ago and <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> reed fully understood how patient gary kubiak was going to be with his running game in his offense he said i have to match that patient i have to stay with my running game even if we have a bad series or two thirtytwo and they will run for it and get the first down with where as he gets across the 45 yard line so that run game has been affected that we have seen teams find a way to move the ball effectively on the ground against denver wade <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> said you know when you have a legendary defense youd like to keep them all and there were some guys who left and for the moment they find some spots to run against this denver dude yeah im malik jackson being one of them in there danny trevathan a tremendous linebacker im sure you would have liked to have had them all but big money comes after you win a super bowl welcome to 2016 in the nfl after one here in denver kansas city nothing denver nothing and sunday night football continues at the bees messages tonight s aerial coverage from denver brought to you by geico <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> tirico and for al michaels along with chris collinsworth michele tafoya you get your partner back on thursday al s colleague gave it to this guy john elway along the way so many decisions that had to be made around this broncos team everyone talked about the quarterback issue all year but the players who you keep as christmas talking about when you win a championship and others want the pieces that made you a champion quarterback issues not over yet either were still gonna be plenty of conversation on that one but on the radio it says you think it s a three and seventeen not a seven and three team before off someone s gonna be the quarterback smith with a roll looking to take a deep shot it was covered dangerous pass and incomplete for where with a flag down dangerous because <person player="shane ray" race="UNK" position="DE">shane ray</person> was over there got a hand on it the chiefs line might have gotten downfield a bit too far pete morelli coming over to gary kubiak to give him the options on that first and 10 play ineligible man downfield number 75 offense fiveyard penalty still first step big play here was made by <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon marshall</person> right there he s looking at the tight end coming across the formation here and then he falls back on <person player="demetrius harris" race="UNK" position="TE">demetrius harris</person>on really saved the day they that was their homerun play they bootlegged away from that you saw <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> take a look it wasnt there and then <person player="shane ray" race="UNK" position="DE">shane ray</person> got a finger on the ball to the accepted penalty takes it back to first and 15 those down to the game in that first quarter for for the chiefs two for the broncos chelsey the third time in and <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> gets out there to make the play on the second year chiefs receiver ill bet you the kansas city chiefs think there s three of them out there i mean bob <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> s 20 yards down the field and you think oh boy this is fantastic youve got <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> way out here he s not going to rush her passer and then he just wrecks your quick screen on the outside it s amazing how many times <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> that we see him doing something other than rushing the quarterback and yet he gets the number of sacks that he does and he s willing to do it to chris there are a lot of guys to get those sack numbers but dont you keep you over here he s more than willing to get out there and do it run with he will you lose a yard here as <person player="todd davis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">todd davis</person> joint <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darian stewart</person> weve just got a four year contract extension on that tackle well and what s happening now is the denver broncos are starting to get it too theyre starting to understand that the kansas city chiefs arent going to take a lot of chances on the offensive side so theyre starting to get closer and closer to the line of scrimmage and wait <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> is going to start firing a few shots especially right here need to get to the denver 44 yarder in front of <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> so i cant see wasnt even thinking about trying to get downfield to get the first down just get something maybe make make a man miss his denver defense good right now yeah i hope people out there can appreciate this game you know i mean this is fantastic defensive football i know people love when they score lots of points but these two teams have so much respect for the other teams defense third 14 that was a give up absolutely here we go into flat let s punt it let our defense go win it for a while special teams at flavor to a breaker should be the difference in this game the lefty <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">dustin colquitt</person> kicks it jordan or we find space together this d anthony thomas is crowding up the long field for the broncos to start the second quarter score talk about a defensive minded game if you have one of these cornerstones they can change your defense into the same draft in 2011 <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> and <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> both have come and both have made a huge impact to see where their sack numbers right jj watts the player with most sexes 2011 but they have been right up there remember the great <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> 22 sacks season and <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> top ten in the league five of the last six seasons and these are guys who get chipped they get double they get backs and they get everything to stop them and they still change the game doing that so far the broncos cause team tolya two first downs in 38 yards on their first three drives looks like <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> was early defense in quotes for number 95 fiveyard penalty now for quarterbacks they call that selfpreservation you need that hard count every once in a while those pass rushers come after you all night long but you know dont forget <person player="dee ford" race="UNK" position="DE">dee ford</person> is was at least leading to leave coming into today with 10 sacks and he is not even playing in this one if <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> gets right look out this is first and <person player="tyler bray" race="white" position="QB">tyler</person> to the left with the devante hooker well be sure the first downs talk a little bit more about <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> s sort of taken over at least in the first half it was an early third down stop that he came up with that bought the punter out then got the pass rush go and watch the hands how he s gonna work his hands and rip up underneath do you know where we saw that pregame warmup he got that mask on it cuts the oxygen down a little bit people wondered they were hoping actually here at denver that the altitude would slow him down not so much it s them the first down so that penalty put dead bird first and five and allows them to get a little breathing room around to the 32 yard line yeah that s the kind of run theyre looking for out of devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> it was really interesting during the bye week they essentially called him into a room and put on some of his own tape and said you tell me you tell me are you breaking them enough tackles out there are you giving us enough and now here he comes out and makes a nice run there he from utah tries to get to the edge and he is held on to by <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> middle game the other guy that you have in the game right now is <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> number 83 the tight in and they feel like maybe theyve got a guy at <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> that can begin to stretch that field a little bit with the passing game <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">virgil green</person> an excellent blocking tight in they really need that sort of middle of the field threat and theyre hoping it s <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> came up with a couple of big third down conversions for him a couple of weeks ago he also came in as <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> came on by the training staff to thomas it s incomplete with <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth</person> actor though severe in coverage so the nichols even nelson is out to the down a corner a little more time for <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">acker</person> the third year man out of smu tonight now a knacker has gotten a little playing time here lately he took over the start for <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> a week ago who is out with that hip injury but cant play it much better than that and that s one thing that is really kind of new to the league i dont remember guys playing corner on slants coming underneath you you think oh man how risky is that because youre gonna give up a big play but time after time those guys make that play just think about that big body of thomas at six for three how often he s been shielding people you see bibs is back in the game after that big hit capri bibs was lying next to <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon as denver takes the timeout we check in with michelle well you guys have been talking about <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> and it s been about ten months since he had surgery on his left knee he told us it was a complete repair of his acl along with a tuneup of the ace lcl now the acl is the most important ligament in the knee as it keeps the shin bone directly under the thigh bone and the lcl is the ligament which keeps the outside of the knee stable when changing directions and he began the season on it physically unable to perform list and as you mentioned <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> only recently back at michelle he was telling all of us know a little rusty in that first game out but if you look at the snap count that he had for that game 55 play against tampa started knock that rough stock pretty quickly it looks good tonight 39 for simeon weve got the spuds and it s complete the <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> for the first down of manual <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> with the grab onto the chiefs side at the kansas city 47 yard line gary kubiak is gonna light now on <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon one of the things that they were worried about since he hurt his shoulder in week four was that he wasnt moving around the same way he was he wasnt picking up key first downs running the football there you see him very comfortably making that move i went to with <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> coming down at me but that was the kind of play we saw him make the first four weeks he really didnt make in the last three or four thirtynine they picked up 20 to be the first down he s trying to get back to flags down as the pressure was coming adjusted you said kill and boom later number 74 offense 10yard penalty still first down and right tackle sombrero yeah and sam <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley</person> i was about to go to the bench because he just simply cant handle <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> he is a guy that tends to catch instead of shooting those arms out into the chest of <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> using his strength but youve got to believe now it s just a matter of time until <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson it s another shot now stevenson s been struggling too clearly that right tackle position has been the one that they just dont seem to be able to come up with an answer for it chiefs fans know <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">stephenson</person> he was with kansas city s first four years <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> right around him again and for city to step up into the rush and a sack for <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">kendall</person> race these chargers started the season with washington <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">reyes</person> gets a sack here we go right around the edge one more time for <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> and then what does that do it forces simeon to step up into the pocket and <person player="max garcia" race="UNK" position="C">max garcia</person> whose strength is run blocking not pass blocking just gets a handful of <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">kendall reyes</person> and when were seeing this going both directions you cant lock in oneonone you got to give him some help at this point well they have been trying theyve been chipping on both edges but so far not enough really us <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell</person> okay has had a few problems pass protection too with bits in there goes the 47 yard line gain of eight for capri bibs and <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> the 12year veteran made the stop way <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> will flow sideline to silent both these guysre amica wilson is also a guy that can move very well and watch <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> right here and when he gets to the point of the tackle a lot of times he takes this low path he s going to go in there at your knees you had better have your head on a swivel and know where he is and sort of fighting off an achilles injury limping around a little bit but fighting through it 30:16 the broncos in this first half <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> watch them dry low not extend his arms at all he just catches <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> there s no extension there s no punch there s no stopping <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> coming around the edge you either have to chip or take sam <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley</person> out at this point i mean it s just obvious unless you can start coaching them over on the sidelines flag comes down as <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley dixon</person> gets rid of that trying to keep it away from the hill it s a pretty good kick gonna pin him back inside the 10yard line right at the 10 but let s see what the flag is all about holding number 45 kicking team 10yard penalty remains fourth down that s on the long snapper thomas garrett just signed it i differ what a game we have for you thursday night on full rest cuz they both play about thanksgiving but dallas cowboys at 10 and 1 taking on the minnesota vikings 7:30 eastern on nbc nfl network and streaming live on twitter best record in the nfl won 10 in a row mafic youll see the next two cowboy games here on nbc that one on thursday in minneapolis and then against the giants couple weeks from tonight it is stunning what theyve done isnt it what rod marinelli is done with that defense i i cant believe it it s stunning enough to see two rookies play like that and i think maybe but more stunning is what theyre doing on the defensive side a ball they dont have the people i proceed to this game tonight again a penalty is gonna cost em two field position it s a good tackle in the open field by benny <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> the backup receivers instead of being back for ten chiefs are gonna get it around the 33 yard line you love defense you come to the right place on this sunday night great institution kansas in lawrence kansas itll turn out a lot of nfl players without for one year they had both <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person>on to keep to leave and they are in denver now remember to leap drafted by the buccaneers is in the leak before harris harris undrafted turns out theyve got as good a pair of corners as anybody in the league part of the dental defensive story to the championship last year the seven and three start this year expected the chiefs to go to the 34 was deflected as he was trying to get it to terry hill <person player="sylvester williams" race="nonwhite" position="DT">sylvester williams</person> got his hand on now and one thing that i think is interesting is that <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> is one of the great receiving tight ends everybody knows that he s not a real drive blocker in the run game and i think that s fair enough to say and so when he now lines up and tight it s almost as more of sort of a chip let s hope <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> over there let s give him one more thing to think about then get out in the pasture out but when you throw incomplete on first down youve got issues now against this defense while davis is the back they give it to him going left and he gets a yard jarrod creek got rid of the offensive lineman shed him to make the tackle they all think of <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> is one of those pass rushers ill draw a skinny circle in there but he is a guy that takes great pride in stopping the run and sometimes just as knowledge you see those veteran guys out there and theyll actually call out where the play is coming and it s kind of funny we have some interviews this year with quarterbacks ago we caught out a third of our plays out there you know what are we gonna do about third and eight broncos are coming smith is running for his life and this bench it just got rid of it enough for the pass rush without tj warty you mentioned earlier is so good coming in from the secondary as well yeah they leave <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> in the ball game and as their single defensive lineman i think that s him right there but then they bring in three of those outside linebackers as pass rushers and you can just see that <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> has no interest in hanging in that pocket whatsoever i mean that thing broke down from the start once again that incomplete pass on first down basically the drive was over justin <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">colquitt</person> to kick it nuts it catches it in a whole mess of trouble and be taken down at the five yard line it s entirely possible that s how this games gonna be water loss some kind of play like that danfa d thomas and <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> were all the way down but the mistake was made when <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">norwood</person> busted it pins the broncos of the five isis down the hometown of the abs we remind you that weve got wednesday night rivalry penguins are looking good city cross very terrific run pittsburgh will take on the island is followed by the sharks of the kings in their california battle youll get wednesday night rivalry coverage starting at 7:00 eastern on nbc sn well you saw the problems some dry low had to tackle <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson the former chief is in it right tackle man on first down devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> runs left for denver and games three theyre trying to get some of those stretch run plays going and one of the key guys for that is their center <person player="matt paradis" race="white" position="C">matt paradis</person> i think probably along with maybe a couple other guys the best center in football it s so quick off the line of scrimmage he basically doesnt practice during the week he has two bad hips he got a couple of practices in this week because of the bye week and then shows up and just plays lightsout week after week after week 58% of their run yardage right around him pass incomplete blanket coverage <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> didnt give him annual <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> any space him well that s the best flock weve seen all night here s <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson right there taking a shot at <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> at least he got in his way that s pretty rocksolid and youve got to think that stevenson who lost his job who was a former kansas city chief he s going to be loaded for bear coming out here tonight and just he just has to load up against that bull rush youve got to make <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> use some moves use something other than im just gonna run over and there s justin over here now on the defensive right side next to tom aha way maybe they got some game going on here on 37 cons you see paul is out it will be a safety and today s and it is recovered finally held on to by <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell</person> okuni so the safety there and chris you scented that muffed punt in the bad field position <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> gets what looks like his third sack and puts kansas city on the board to chiefs sitting in this game that <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> and the defense score first last week was his first game in 44 weeks because of the knee injury ill say the rust has been knocked off first player with three straight multiple sack games and chiefs broncos rivalry the three sacks the forced fumble there of course it s since 1982 because that s the time the sack became an official stat it doesnt matter official on official this guy s having a whale of a first day im sure somebody over there is going yeah you got fresh legs nobody is gonna love you forever on the bench so after the safety broncos was the free kick and <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley dixon</person> the punter will do any kicks in 65 yards and tyriq ill get room to rock defense special teams kansas city for the big stretch to take the lead it was just a matter of time he was so close on two others and you just have to wonder why anybody kicks the football to this guy because once he gets in the open field it is just over these guys are fairly well positioned but you just cant practice from 4:00 to 5:00 speed he has already had two touchdowns called back this year that s the emmys one of the leading punt returners despite that it has just been almost every single game that ive watched that either tyreke hill is scoring a touchdown or coming very very close to it what an amazing player he s been an 86 yard return of the free kick by hill and kiro <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> on for the extra point dozen seconds it goes from scoreless t9 nothing kansas city with your offense never coming on the field exactly yeah whatd you forget better in there very good let s go back to what started it all <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> sack now watch this youre gonna see him go into the tackle <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell</person> oh coon right here to set up this stunt but as he does he gets to the inside edge which allows them a straight path to the quarterback that s called a picked up my man how he long taught me that back in the day when i was sitting around the studios with him but that is how you end up once you get to that inside edge and get that shoulder there s nothing that tackle can do because once you angle out and then that ball really was on the ground for a little while oh coon was on it then it squirted free as the two defenders knocked him up and chris on this return <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley dixon</person> you want to kick it numbers and to the sideline and he did and so theyve kind of setting up that way but you talked about hill it s just one guy who gets to the wrong angle and he s got he got no shot at catching up with i mean what s really amazing is that kansas city s offense has done next to nothing can we say that no doubt you know before first downs yeah next to nothing and theyre theyre leading 9 enough so kara <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> will kick this one off and pick it all the way out of the back of the end zone nothing here and here s michelle well <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> tyreke hill was a controversial pick for the chiefs because in 2015 he pleaded guilty to domestic views of abuse of his pregnant girlfriend while at oklahoma state now chiefs gm john dorsey said after the pick quote weve done our due diligence to fully vetting our draft class we would never put anybody in this community in harm s way hell receive the deferred 3year sentence <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> yeah dorsey made those comments michelle usually waits until after the entire draft monday they have a press conference but he knew there was an immediate reaction a negative way in that community and he wanted to come out addressing those issues and concerns to watch a hooker with the carry for about four yards you know firsthand the chiefs more than any team had the experience of domestic violence right in the parking lot of arrowhead remembered javon belcher the linebacker in september of 2012 shot and killed his girlfriend before committing suicide so this is something that s been around this franchise there s a sensitivity around the league but certainly there whether it was right or not that s their call their decision but they sure it was tough for the family of cassandra perkins as an organization they obviously put them through every program that you can possibly imagine and he s still ongoing and you know it always gets into those fine lines of second chances versus maybe you dont deserve a second chance sometimes but they took a chance and eread said i was impressed with him i felt like that he was truly sorry and we gave the chance to medical staff looking at <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> s he runs by <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> sets up third and one the 40yard line to the ball come out <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> was holding that ball and theyre gonna save down carl <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> needs to be the vicepresident of officiating for the league is that one fulltime official the league has he s back on the field is alive judge in the last four years he was right there and said it was down by contact at first down that ball is out and because he fell back over the leg i dont think a knee or anything ever went down do you see a clear recovery though that would be the question maybe reach stay right by the efficiency supports that fleck does not throw it they dont challenge level so it s going to be a gain of 29:14 on the play and 15 on the hit from barry presumably personal foul unnecessary roughness in our defensive player 15yard penalty automatic first down because that happens just in <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> hits the locker room for the chiefs boy any time as a receiver getting held up by one guy and take his shot to the other you could see eric barry i dont think it was helmet the helmet contact came up the whole wagging finger there no it definitely helmets a helmet now that s exactly what it was wow 229 with the penalty with <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> out front sambo is the other edge rusher with tomahawk way he will gain eight yards on that one it s amazing how the game has changed now that <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> is out at least have time and that s the thing about the kansas city secondary theyre gonna play man coverage theyre gonna take a lot of chances you think boy we can get some double moves on these guys they try and jump routes <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> does problem is you dont have time to do all that stuff there is <person player="frank zombo" race="UNK" position="LB">zombo</person> the former kansas starter for <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> bay back to the school year with kane since 20 yard line on the carrots right the first down mark and theyll move the chains here with 316 before halftime it s been pretty impressive really what kansas city has been able to do without some of their key guys in there just in march lillard <person player="allen bailey" race="UNK" position="DE">allen bailey</person> jay <person player="jaye howard" race="UNK" position="DT">howard</person> d ford none of those guys that were effectively their starters on this defense are out there playing in this game tonight and yet we see bob sutton time after time come out and put on a great show on the defensive side and he <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> and <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">virgil green</person> at the top and <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">green</person> the tight end comes into this tight spot simian on the booth being perceived by chris james go away the chapter fat <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> very close to another first down just shy of that first down at the 10th <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simians best play of the night right there because <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> was all over him <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> did not go for that fake down the line of scrimmage and he just simply was outrun by simeon ordinarily dont throw back across your body but when it works looks good and i tell you for <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> he had a fantastic game against the saints two weeks ago couple of onehanded catches and you get the feeling really over the past two or three weeks and he s really starting to find his rhythm he targeted him 11 times these guys had peyton manning throwing him the ball and trying to find the rhythm with a young quarterback twominute warning best possession of the broncos knight on going coming up mama toyota halftime a water performance by <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> cara doing cam newton raiders atop this division the bucks defense siamese siamese the seahawks bob costas will be here to look ahead to the cowboys vikings game on thursday night paul coming up toyota halftime just outside the 10 second and one for <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon and the play killed with the flag false start number 83 offense fiveyard penalty remains second down on the tight end <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> here s michelle well we saw <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> go back to the locker room he has just come out back onto the sidelines probable with a shoulder injury but at don terry po to the list of injuries on the lists all week on the injury report with a back injury he is questionable not in there at this time guys okay me show him and go back to that back surgery that he had in 2015 it was a concern with po penalty makes it second and six be careful with this team come up games over there especially this part of the field right in the red zone seven turnovers for the kansas city chiefs and this is the ultimate sort of bin but dont break defense and they are again it s it s just uncanny how many times this season you know you think oh boy theyre just running over this defense and theyre marching up and down between the 20s and then they get down in that red zone and they make a play third and six gary kubiak steam kept off the board in field goal range wed love to get a touchdown get a little bit of momentum going to halftime simian has deflected and it s incomplete barry through his hands upon his head defensive front no those hands up there <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">kendall reyes</person> who had the sack earlier might have been the one to get a hand on it there or a helmet i couldnt tell this one bounce off is your tittle <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">reyes</person> just gave a header they kept it out of the goal <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">brandon mcmanus</person> will come on for the field goal 33 yards remember the snapper change this

that safety he personally delivered thanksgiving dinners to families in need in kansas city kick all the way through touch back canton will take over after 25 they get the ball to start the second half as well chris we saw what the raiders did with their car you can see those highlights again at halftime that only adds to the import of what s going to happen the rest of this half of the secondary no question about it i know it s been a bit of a defensive slugfest out here but that s what these two teams are about and you think oh boy or either one of them good enough to go to the super bowl well the denver broncos won the super bowl with this exact formula a season ago so you wonder here will kansas city even take much of a chance or be perfectly happy trying to go into the half with a lead theyve won the toss and deferred see denver s defense has a big play in them to the ground as <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> came screaming around the edge for the set watch the way he works his hands coming around so much for the shutout for <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> it s amazing how low that guy gets who was it gave us the description that <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> could run full speed under a table i think that s about right as he turns that corner these big tackles just dont have much of an opportunity to stop him this matthew stafford last year when you guys had been her playing detroit right <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> with the sack that s tended to have sacks on the season at for the moment he has to leave second at 15 let s put the run there with two timeouts denver will slam one here with 61 seconds till halftime chris said it so well kansas city took the 9 nothing lead their offense never touched the field safety and then the return of the free kick by 86 yards by tyreke hill the offense has been four possessions four months the denver optics fieldgoal drive was the first time in optics led a scoring drive in this game tonight third and 13 sniff stepped up into pressure stepped up into the arms of <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> he gets two sacks on this drive timeout denver will get the ball back without timeouts so the denver defense does the job and get the ball back to the offense without timeouts remember <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan norwood</person> left the last punt gave denver poor field position led to the safety he s back to this dusty cold quick care 254 yards from the 28 here comes <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">norwood</person> seven

harris" race="UNK" position="TE">demetrius</person> here so youre gonna give a little chip and then <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> goes right down broadway to get <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> and that s just one sack here s the other one going right around and turning the corner like some kind of a speed skater or something to get the first of those two sacks shuffle those shoulders a little bit man you said it right at the top we who are the stars in this game the defensive stars with <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> s giving us three sacks of the safety <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> to there no timeouts 44 seconds left for city to <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> who took the big hit at the back end of the play barry has just been laying people out as three big hits there at barry here tonight you know and this is really an opportunity for <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon there s <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> im sure the <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon knows all about that as well but <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> and thomas have had exactly one 100yard game each this year and that is certainly something theyre not used to seeing out of this offense after that do it there there <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> was waiting for devon take <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> 34 seconds left im gonna tell you what this is a violent game here tonight we have seen some unbelievable hits it s almost like these two defenses are playing against each other you can just see the pride on each side of the ball and it s which offense is going to blink of course the kansas city defense and special teams came up with nine points and they are just determined to win the game by themselves i could just hear them on the sidelines going guys forget about it weve got nine points we dont need any help from our offense let s win it from here third and ten lasers have in there it stopped by a jade <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> the china ended was with the patriots got traded here he s a yard short of the first down this is one of those <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> s gonna take a timeout with 22 seconds left before fourth and to see if hell force kubiak to punt the ball nfl fans you can order your holiday gifts from nfl shop comm do it today get up to 25% off at the official store of the nfl nfl shoppingcom now what are the odds that youre thinking if theyre gonna pluck this ball to tyree kill but i think theyve learned their lesson dont you i think below zero is there such a thing then you have odds below zero im not the odds guy youre asking the wrong guy bars are up here electrifying one earlier so let me ask what people are saying at home is it bad offense or these defenses really this good it s not believable defense i mean you didnt you couldnt watch this step were deeply watch this and good this isnt just unbelievable and what the kansas city chiefs have done so far arent you believing it better <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley dixon</person> set to kick it away this is get away somewhere toward the sideline dont let him get his hands on it you would think with 13 seconds left in getting the ball to start the second half kansas city let s take a knee and take this to the locker room do i want tyree killed to have it or the kansas city offense cant city offense while youre up six and you have 50 yards of total offense you dont see those stats very often the one big play was the 86 yarder that hill took back off the free kick denver is one drive coming when <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> was out of the game so this one forecast as expected that was all about tyree hill and nandi offense just in case you want to make a mistake well gladly help you out at the break here in denver kansas city with the lead and the defending super bowl champs have to come back to the second half or they fall two games behind the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> lead with five to go toyota halftime is coming up but first these messages from your local nbc station tonight s first half highlights are brought to you by chevrolet <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> he could end up mounting a big night tonight he is breaking the broncos in this first half ball is out and it will be a safety fitting in this game that <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> and the defense score first helens going to take this all the way once he gets in the open field it is just over chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row back in the altitude and the beauty of the home of the super bowl champion broncos back in denver kansas city leads nine three <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> uses work there as weve started this second half three sacks the forced fumble leading to that safety the only credited <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> with half a sack on the second one he got on that last drives is a sack and a half 11 leads the league and when hill took that back 86 yards on the return to the free kick it s the first time seeing a sport on that free kick after a safety since the texans did it seven years ago kansas city chiefs scored nine points of the second quarter they had no first downs and four for the game but they have the lead and as chris said right at the beginning this is a game about defense and a game about knowing who you are <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> to kick to start this second half randy kitson d anthony thomas watches it go over his head well these game wreckers on the outside append to it exactly that verse <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> just making his way right and bruised nice and bright low and to switch and then of course these ends up he s partially responsible for it all so bob <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> said if youve got that ive got this coming around the edge then and then coming right down broadway there i guess they may have <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> happened that but they do is mostly <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> there so kansas city will start from a tone 25 theyre back to <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where they will to trs flag down where eight runs 29 yards as long as carey was seven the longest run in the game has been a 10 yard run by denver s devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> pete morelli tell us they were going that away illegal shift offense fiveyard penalty remains first down to the sideline michele tafoya well the chiefs just 49 yards of offense in the first half i asked <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> about that he said weve got to stay out of third along and we gotta just keep swinging as for gary kubiak he said theyve tried everything in the book to block <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> but he said we got to do better but there s a fine line between using guys to help protect and letting those same guys go make plays 43 degree night down there wind just picked up a little bit s back at 10 miles per hour hill gets it from smith no good read there and he got hit hard by <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> didnt catch him send <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> after him not on my watch that s not bob <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> one or two this is <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> 3 he s the one responsible for the plan down here he only got one of the greatest athletes in the world he makes a oneonone tackle with no problem just you know whatever i you know i would pay him a lot of money i guess they did i his paid defensive player in the league super bowl mvp second at 14 smith thinks about it twice and is taken down on the run by <person player="jared crick" race="UNK" position="DE">jared crick</person> was that an active game a couple of yards for <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> chris last year this was so much of kansas city s game smith was fourth in the league among quarterbacks and rushing yards not so much this year yeah you know he had the concussion and or whatever it was they ended up describing it as and you just wonder if it s in his head a little bit we talked to him about that and the fact that he said when i run from now on im not sliding he got his head banged on the turf two times in that ball game he said from now on all headfirst slides for me gonna be a football player look at that the impact when he s six yards a game was it up the first downs of game he would get last year in those first down scrambles play clock running down third i need one denison s going nowhere intended for the metreon harris denver at everything on lockdown and it s a three announce open the half for kansas city i mean they are sitting there at third and 11 and the defenders for the denver broncos are sitting down at about seven yards they dont think theyre gonna throw any pass any farther down the field than that because of the way their defense is playing right now i mean even those passes on third down really arent intended to try and get first down so you might as well run <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">dustin</person> cole quick picks again <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan norwood</person> sit down a lucky man winds up to catch 42yard orleans got it thank god laster that s the third special team set for <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> on this night denver will take over at the 37 down six all these guys involved in it you know the story from the off season peyton manning retires osweiler goes to <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> so john elway has to make the decision with gary kubiak where they go with quarterback use of mark sanchez no they end up with <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon and now citians got the opportunity of a lifetime he s sitting on six weeks here five and a half games he has the <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> for this first down carry of three yards what a chance chris you can ride a great defense if the rest of the offense comes along to the playoffs and make a playoff run this opportunity in your career if everybody can get going in true chief is <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> well i dont know if i were <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon and i heard the guys saying you this is a great opportunity for you that were all cheering for you that we have important six games in the playoffs to see about your career id be like wait a minute now im seven and two as a starter here does that not count for anything and yet we know that john elway is not shy about pulling the trigger yet tim tebow playoff game that he won and he came back with peyton manning the next year and said that wasnt enough for me so john elway is playing for one thing and one thing only and that s a world championship and if he thinks <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon can get it done hell be the guy if he doesnt john will not be shy about pulling the trigger on that one <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> helped to the sidelines <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> s been big on special teams that s looking run of the night either way first down for the broncos out to the chiefs side of the field well there we are again going right up behind <person player="matt paradis" race="white" position="C">matt paradis</person> the center so many times so many of their yards go right in the a gap right on either side of the center and here we go again once your center can control that nose you have a chance and we mentioned 57 <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">alexander</person> was in the game for johnston for <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> gotten held for the fullback jagger s couldnt make the play the 47 first and broke the city that s <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> again but ladies and gentlemen defensive player of the week batman well he s on tackle number two at this point in the game now <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson is gonna get this inside move here my guys from pro football focus just text me this guy got a 55 grade in the first half there are guys that dont get that great in three years of their career that s like off the charts it s ridiculous so is he cooking through one arm tackle and he s finally stopped tompa holly is over there guys been to the pro bowl five times who really was very instrumental in <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> s development when he came in holly s been in the league eleven years now yeah and theyve really been kind of taking it easy on tom bali this year and i think you know you just keep seeing that if this strategy could work you know d4 comes back from that hamstring injury <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> continues to play like this and tom poly is fresh for the end of the season in the playoffs this could be an unbelievably dynamic gas rushing force on this defensive team as well as important plays you feel position is decent it s 35 here come the chiefs thomas for the first down just inside the 20 yard line with <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth</person> burt there in coverage this time <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> right over the center gonna try and come right there and theyre gonna bring <person player="ron parker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ron parker</person> i believe it was right there so it left oneonone coverage on the outside if you want to know why teams do not is because these two receivers on the outside are simply too good and remember that steve nelson <person player="steven nelson" race="UNK" position="DB">steven nelson</person> is not in the game he s their ordinary nickel guy so that put a corrine in that situation 24 sent me through it the only place he could gracious game for caprese goodness gracious dont even need to say with us if this were chess you just take your <person player="david king" race="UNK" position="DE">king</person> and lay it over it s like i can see it im done ive had enough of this stuff <person player="virgil green" race="nonwhite" position="TE">virgil green</person> takes his shot watch him try to come out and there s <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> again just going through the fullback and a tight in and do not do die what a night i think he s feeling pretty good yeah so much for the rust acl at lcl surgery on the knee that michelle told you about the first man this is <person player="cj anderson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj</person> <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">alexander</person> on the other side a lot of scrimmage the second year man out of oregon state with the big hit bibs this time youre gonna see the center <person player="matt paradis" race="white" position="C">matt paradis</person> almost getting surprised going to help here and try to get there but it was too late we got <person player="dj alexander" race="UNK" position="LB">dj alexander</person> just going to shoot that get back mips has taken some shots and i there have been some huge hits in this game and you know weve had a penalty or two but for the most part theyre all legal shots this has just been an amazing defensive game oldschool feels oldschool done but like the bears and the packers or something the snow this is the deficient way that was put it up in the air and put up a bunch of points timeout temper next weekend premier league on nbc and nbcsn three of the top four team to the table chelsea in man city their first and third narcis fourth arsenal will take on <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> handless london rivals at it youll see it on nbc and nbcsn barber street moto lower downtown denver third and 13 here for the broncos for simeon is <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> in the tight end just like he was in the second quarters about a yard and a half shy of the first down <person player="ron parker" race="nonwhite" position="DB">ron parker</person> made the tackle you would think take the point since the game is so close the rumbling of the crowd tells you there s no kicker coming out and for the moment kubiak screw gonna go for it yeah it s just so hard to get down here your quarterback just makes a big play <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> makes a big play to get it close and now youre thinking who do i over what and steve pensive wine and im sure not running it to the right im running left if im writing anywhere their accounts in mississippi tries to keep it and get there he gets tagged at the end of the play by barry let s see where the fuller progress will be marked and then it was late that simian came popping out marking speakers then their eyeball in it did he get it there i think that s the ultimate forward progress because after that his knee would hit the ground so let s see in our own minds if we could mark this thing looks like just sure does he ever get to that give him the first down they do mark the ball at the front end of the eight yard line i think youve heard plenty of conversations about marking the ball this weekend if you watch the ohio state michigan game and where do you get a spots suction in exact science but it was pretty clear there that you could see that eight yard line i personally didnt think he got into that eight yard line hagan has to be so clear that he was shy of it for replay to turn it over and read dont swaggin management the 41 keeper by simeon and devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> hits ensue and markham to the six so here we go here s the 8 yard line right here let s see if he gets there remember the ball not his helmet not anything else does the ball get there i dont think so i didnt think it didnt either and then is not directly down the line that s pretty close to down the line you see where the ball was almost just under his left shoulder which had gotten turned the other way second and goal play by philip <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">gaines</person> again same thing that slacker out right absolutely here he is back underneath there we go just goes right underneath the route and that is multiple times good throw by simeon just a better plate defensively and i tell you it <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">gaines</person> is not far away from reaching over there with two hands and rapid one that was he was in that position remember this defense seven turnovers down here in the red zone be careful <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> third and goal chased by <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> retraces his steps simeon s got room will he run it or throw that a throat endzone touchdown <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> they like me now says <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> had a bead on him he doubles back across the way and then it s <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> look at that move in the back of the end zone he faked like he was going to the back edge and then came back both feet down clean catch and <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon with a trademark play for his curly career <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> but he had to maybe a little tug there by at the end of that thing by stevenson got away with it as big extra point it s not through and denver takes the lead <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> s the receiver the peyton manning keep the nickname sunshine s remember the titans to the long hair he was helped paint in the rehab process last year this year he s helped with the broncos he s given them a onepoint lead i hope you can watch a very special episode it s tv s number one news show now nominated for three people s choice awards including best drama definite scene this is us you need to check it out tuesday night eastern and pacific 8:00 central right here on nbc ill be studying dallas at minnesota you can binge watch that show and you will love it when you get chance to catch your breath touch back here what a play this was on both ends id like to binge watch this one for a little while that s <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon escape here and let s give a little credit to <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson for staying with justin you stood over there but then it was sunshine coming out of that late break almost ten seconds that play took then quite approached the donovan mcnabb play in dallas of over 14 seconds but look at that little move and that was the key thing gave him just enough space on the outside to come back and make that play he got his first touchdown of his career and new orleans comes right back with a huge one here take over at their own twentyfive at <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> aware with the run that s about four yards so we were talking about <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> and sunshine from remember the titans it it s such a cool story he was working like triple days where his own practice staying late but he was getting there early as peyton manning was rehabbing from the foot injury and peyton would say hey grab <person player="jeff heuerman" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff heuerman</person> who s a tight end to his on injured reserve with a foot injury <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> who wasnt seeing much action died from the equipment staff anybody so you can go through those workouts trying to get ready and he did remember manning bought the seats for <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> going to the super bowl and jordan got his own seat but one of the reasons he s on this roster is cuz a gary kubiak son klein kubiak who was with him in college and said dad we gotta keep an eye on the sky clyde s part of this football operations staff and they got <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> and he s given employment cant see that item to the chiefs across the 40 parted into 45 but first had to pick up a 15 every play ends with a big hit and here comes kelsey across the formation and for once nobody ends up picking him up you see him coming all the way across the formation and that match zone just got fouled up a little bit then there s the newest millionaire right there <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">darian stewart</person> came up with a new contract you see why he had three turnovers in the game against the saints in new orleans was spectacular in that game where s first down since the first quarter for kansas city 650 now in the third as where carries in to yours you know i tell you who else has been big in this game so far and his return is <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> you know that was the one defensive element at that inside pressure the malik jackson kind of roll the guy that gets some push up the middle so those outside pass rushers but also against the run theyre rotating him in more and more in this game you see the big elbow brace on him sort of looking like jj watt over there but he s had a nice game so far with the 49 <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> kelcey was followed by <person player="todd davis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">todd davis</person> the inside linebacker to be third down coming up now and for <person player="todd davis" race="nonwhite" position="LB">todd davis</person> sort of taken over for danny trevathan in that role we talked so much about <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> and his ability to rush well check you out what else he can do he just drops back in coverage you remember the super bowl that was maybe one of the biggest plays in the game having coverage down the boundary the for the chief skirt down begin tonight but you bought those tj nosing around eric he s got the first down terrific play all the way around will parts the safety the rookie had to make the tackle it s a great job that time by <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> forcing denver to show this blitz they started moving he knew exactly the offensive line could figure it out they pick it up and then they get their main man <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> out there on the rookie <person player="william parks" race="UNK" position="DB">parks</person> and bull park should not feel badly about that i havent seen anybody look at that move by <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> just electric from the tight end position eight completions on the night to smith three of them to kelsey nothing down to you where to keep his ballot to get to the 25 an 18yard first down game that was an amazing move at the tail end of that thing looked like he was going down <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> is one of the best tacklers in the league just had a direct beat on him and somehow ware was able to do that and let that bullet fly by him almost like that hand he was using to not go to the ground give me a chance to pivot in the direction and weve seen everything else tonight he said before is a former quarterback whose high school days great athlete again five inside the redzone we take it under four minutes third quarter denver ten kansas city nine two very similar teams playing their type of football here here s that inside zone play now and watch <person player="mitch morse" race="UNK" position="OG">mitch morse</person> the center here make the block this is so key because this play is going to fold back behind and then you just sort of move that guy out of there billy win mitch force a very quick guy very athletic inside as well nile davis never letting go quick throat s a hill try to get the speedster on the edge he <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> not gonna let you get there keep to leave gonna make sure that his partner has helped i take <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> is just simply one of the best football players in this league he s a little guy everybody goes yeah big deal he was a slot quarter nobody paid much attention to him and then he got about a fifty million dollar contract slot quarterback slot receivers people that can make plays like that their difference makers in this league third and sixth place going nuts under me to leave terrific pursuit couple yard shy of the first down kansas city will attempt to go at field goal there we go let s watch this right here <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> on the outside oh my goodness i mean now expense we talked about him getting the ball out of his hands quickly he has to and then it was to leave first and then <person player="bradley roby" race="UNK" position="DB">bradley roby</person> with the cleanup hit smith 35 yarder for <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">cairo santos</person> thirdyear kicker out of tulane believed to be the first brazilianborn player in the league he was born in sao paulo execution all the way around by the snapper <person player="james winchester" race="UNK" position="LS">winchester</person> the holder cold whipping and kansas city takes 812 so the fieldgoal was kicked and then after we went to break a flag was thrown in gary kubiak skating the explanation from pete morelli illegal formation on the broncos because in 2013 they put in a rule you could only have six guys on one side of the formation for player safety cant overload denver has seven so the kick went through but the official in the back was counting the players on that side of the snapper said there were seven after they had a consultation you saw the two officials going to talk to each other theyre very clogged did not seven men on the line of scrimmage fiveyard penalty resulted penalties the first down because it was fourth and two at the 17 yard line so obviously kansas city takes the points off the board so instead of being 1210 chiefs it s kansas city first intent at the denver 12 yard line and i think what kubiak was saying was that the the play clock expired so it should have been a fiveyard penalty on down and then smith hops out <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were gonna take a wild cats nap here and he s a former quarterback he s going to keep it here and run inside good push from the old line to get down to the seven yard line on first down and this wildcat formation has become some of their red zone and short yardage formation of choice because you have a guy that has experience running that read option play have reported and also your running back obviously running straight through the hole where he probably would have anyway so now they bring in john reed the extra offensive lineman to try and just overpower denver at this point best looking drive of the night for the chiefs again it is were gonna run to that side and just gain a couple of yards itll be third down coming up we have a chance tell you something that football is brought to you by southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that s transparency by sprint visit sprint calm by mercedesbenz the best or nothing and by amazon echo information music news and gore just ask you ask for snow snow mass nearby aspen colorado delivered got some today s his the season in the rockies <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> who mentioned that elbow injury that he came back from being walked off by the athletic training staff chris i just want to go back to that penalty if you wonder why they make that rule change for players safety three years ago simply put the defensive teams were rushing through the gaps created by the overload when they looked at tape they said too many injuries caused by that formation we know the chiefs back to the second time of this drive with a wildcat who gives to tyranny kill speed on the edge brother corki cut wilson to score the touchdown <person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert</person> wilts in the big block freeze tyree kill for his second touchdown and the penalty ends up allowing the chiefs to score cheating boy id say it takes some nerve to run wide on that one and essentially i think that s <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> unblocked he this play is gonna leave <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> unblocked theyre gonna read him they thought <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> was going to come down and it was tyreke hell able to get on the edge great blocks on the outside there by wilson and by <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> boy how many times do you design a play that you leave vaughn mill or unblocked and it worked it s that whole zone read isaac youre often leaving the best rushed afraid it doesnt fit with anything except when it works if you cant block an adult tell your quarterback hill two touchdowns kansas city back on top 1610 a quid wood here in the rockies tonight aerial coverage is brought to you by geico turning into a good one here in denver like jerry cohen for al michaels with cris collinsworth michele tafoya half minute left in the third and the chiefs respond to the denver touchdown with one of their own 1610 kansas city summers could hang time in depth no return breeze bits in the front goes well weve been talking about these big hits all night long and here we go well start off with five <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> early eric berries had a there <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> comes up with that here at the end but it has been like this all night long ive been getting messages from some of my defensive friends around the league a little fired up watching some defensive football out here watered sack he s loving it sameen back to work with 30 seconds left first down play action i throw intended for <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> who was open but simeon couldnt find the target they see clark hunt back there the chiefs family the hud family has owned the chiefs for 57 years go back through the houses and the bidwells and the rooneys of course clark hunter over the year his dad so influential lamar hunt in the start of the afl which the route to the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> and all these teams papa was a good guy insurgents up ditto cut by thomas in game seven and that should spin us down to the end of the third quarter theyll make it six itll be third and four bobby osa take your take a deep breath here man this is this is gonna be fun and the stakes are high yes they are cause if you dont win youre to back in the <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> with five to go after three kansas city 16 ten for ten sunday night football continues after these messages who the story oakland s right there behind at nine and two we were there a few weeks ago to watch the game against denver at places alive greater passion his bag of it and one of those great performances by <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> carr the pinky injury comes back they end up beating carolina so they are nine and two somebody wins if we dont end up in a tie the winner here will be won back the loser to back you saw those division records keeping my oakland has to go play the last three division games on the road here down the stretch so there is hope maybe the freshman city steps up in the middle of courtney normal equipment boring it in incomplete itll set up fourth down at some play on the outside by <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth acker</person> who s been filling in here tonight they got one against them but when you come up with one like that on third down straight mantoman coverage that s what it s all about just next man up here he is 27 <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">acker</person> that s a good move right there by jordan or would but <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">acker</person> was all over <person player="riley dixon" race="white" position="P">riley</person> dixit kicks to keep it away from him towards the sideline gets good bounce could be 55 yards an all net and the denver is gonna have it back inside their own 15 yard line kansas city s gonna have it i should say this is everything we thought it would be but this is a big pressure quarter going both ways here the fourth yeah and the thing that s been so impressive about this so far zero turnovers right the offenses are doing their jobs as well and their job was to come out here not lose the game of course they had the you know the sack in the end zone and the whole thing out there and that led to nine points out of it but for the most part <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> and i know everybody wants him to throw it deep and they want him to make big plays but he s given his defense given his special teams a chance to vindicate the dirty word in the quarterback industry game manager they hate it but he s been terrific at it it fits what they do i wonder if <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> age not on the check phone <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were with the calorie of the game before you think about <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> and you know he had that carousel in san francisco it s a week different guys and then tim hora ball came in there i really stabilized so hard ball comes in 2011 and since then <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> has turned around look please done the last five years and they had pretty good defense over there in san francisco as well and they come over here and build the same thing and you know for <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> he was always a <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> coast guy he didnt always have a <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> coast quarterback so i think this is kind of the essence of who he is and that s a big reason why they won 17 out of 20 regularseason games second in nine the dip of his shoulder trying to get her on the edge whose <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> and the sack comes from the other side the other terrific player <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> and smith went down hard as where took him to the ground they shot by <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">schwartz</person> here on the outside his <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> comes in <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">schwartz</person> gonna push him by but as <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> stepped up the old highlow here comes to marcus where s going to go underneath eric fischer there and that s how those guys work they actually have signals that says are you go high ill go low then the next time a ill go high you go low because that s what you want to do you want to just force him to step up into the other guy steve a monopolist a long time that web trainer for the broncos is looking at where even though he s the one who smith down so hard the state here take it <person player="shane ray" race="UNK" position="DE">shane ray</person> will get credit for it the guy in place of <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> forces the three it out for the denver defense here s what youre going to see just zone defenses everybody in a zone just the threeman pass rush and they still flush him out of the pocket but <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> youre exactly right <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> the game manager we just talked about said listen guys were alright weve got the lead there s nothing wrong with putting the football here we dont want to make a big mistake he made the right play just to cope with the jordan norway like out moves me by the chiefs yeah the broncos had a block on they had to play and it made him flinch both start of the 14 offense five yard penalty remains it s the rookie receiver <person player="demarcus robinson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demarcus robinson</person> youll see both these guys on the outside they were coming in for a block and another guy come up from the outside and they were had a play on and it just made him flinch okay sup benny <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> 16 also dove in from the left side the bottom of your screen packed all the way up it s rid of it quick not the distance on this one nor what s got to run the long snapper <person player="james winchester" race="UNK" position="LS">winchester</person> down there for kansas city fighting with <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> and everybody s in the pile and it s chiefs paul d anthony thomas was down there and <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">norwood</person> who earlier had the month that gave the poor field position went to the safety this time cant catch that one and the long snapper <person player="james winchester" race="UNK" position="LS">winchester</person> comes up with it yeah <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">norwood</person> wanted to go without the fair catch but because thomas was right there in his face and nicely played by thomas to not get there too soon but for <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">jordan norwood</person> it s been a long night already a couple of those and we talked about it from the very beginning right this is a game that may end up being lost instead of one and what a huge flip of field position there thomas was there on coverage to the right will be a couple of yards long snappers it often are 76 offense 10yard penalty main first down penalty on duvernay tardies the garden theyre often not in the news unless there s a bad snap or a mistaken <person player="james winchester" race="UNK" position="LS">winchester</person> second year out of oklahoma maybe you heard the story his that <person player="michael schofield" race="UNK" position="OT">michael</person> worked at the oklahoma city airport who shot and killed two weeks ago by disgruntled former airport employee he didnt practice that week he came and snapped for the chiefs last week against tampa and the special teams unit the whole team just couldnt believe what a great job he did so you know how heavy his heart is is it right around thanksgiving in the holiday time a moment to feel great about his accomplishment since he s down with so much difficulty and his family is well over the last bounty mixer first in 20 switch away that s a buck i convinced some 45yard love for normandy knows that he gave them a chance but now is when you have to hope in this great defense and it is a great defense can stand up the hardest thing in the world is to make a stop go the pinch start drinking gator and go what what and then as i get your helm you got to run back out on the field now can they make a stand right here in the middle of field and get the ball back a second time second and six all the big people on the left over there nile davis the back education is covered and hello somebody s waiting my name is <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> tonya this is something move on <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">mitchell schwartz</person> here this is like one of those judo guys it looks like it s going to be nothing and then watch the hand movement here just get those hands off <person player="mitchell schwartz" race="UNK" position="OT">schwartz</person> was probably thinking it s going to be a quick screen get out of there go the other way <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">von miller</person> just too quick this was two and a half sacks isnt they were looking for it on three tight ends on that other side too were blocking kelsey was waiting <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> change the timing of all ladies outs time out <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> from the sidelines maybe we got the timeout first up where two oclock running out time out kansas city first team timeout 30 second time you know that s an interesting time out there your third and 13 anyway your odds of converting that first down probably pretty slim and who knows what that timeout may mean towards the end of the game took it theyll take a shot no probably hit a touchdown 62 yards each team has a couple of timeouts left we mentioned earlier if youre with us that there were some issues with the kickers in warmups because the wind was blowing and it was difficult you mentioned the wing out of wind game a few weeks ago for the toughest things for returners to catch a ball in the wind especially the way these guys are kicking it dropping the nose norwoods had a really tough time with a couple of pics and what happened on that it comes down be almost like back towards the punter and you feel like youre never going to catch it you just keep chasing 1313 like <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person>on s name is indeed played on the jersey in his hand as he pulled him down itll be fourth down in norwoods going back again now it s a stroke of confidence he s been so good at this so i think of his <person player="jordan norwood" race="UNK" position="WR">norwood</person> in the super bowl that had that 60 year something yarder right that made a big difference in the game longest punt return in super bowl history the 61 yarder that he had not many other punt return options used thus far this year by denver rustico quit trying to pin a beat with fair catch could breathe but if it wasnt your little sarcastic cheer from the whole crowd as well sunday night football is brought to you by verizon it s always a great gift on verizon by navy federal credit union proudly serving the armed forces and their families by bose get closer and by toyota let s go places denver botanic gardens and blossoms of light their display will sound reactive led light animations many ways to enjoy the holiday season can often furnish hope you had a great thanksgiving good day the wrapup point good one here in denver she s five six carries for the rookie out of utah devon take <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> and justin hughes has been everywhere is there again no game well i think these two guys are pretty good players justin you see i did a lot of homework this week i think i could just learn two names and been alright calling this game it s unbelievable how theyve just dominated from beginning to end on either side of the ball such good defense is that you could take a lot of the afc pro bowl team just from these two defenses no doubt theyre about to a of seeing in tennessee the privilege the 13 sin in taking a shot down field and it is cut by <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> inside the 30th flag on the back end well take them into the let joan 64 on the pass of the catch what a route that was im telling you what a route that was let s see if this flag did not sure which way this might go i just assumed it was gonna be on denver on the take down at the end here it s wait a minute couple the broncos players of the sidelines looked unhappy with what they were hearing the call might be like sports malloy conduct an official choleric collided with the member of the coaching staff the result of the plays are first down after the 15yard penalty it will be first and ten again theyll give you a sideline warrant sometimes but if you run into the bench personnel though here s gary kubiak and here s the official that entire area right there belongs to the official and the minute he bumps into anybody he may not have even known it was gary kubiak that s it look at this route though by <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> coming down he was so close to the line of scrimmage gave that hard inside move and made that huge play it was everybody s booing here but it was absolutely the right call by the officials great throw there by simeon and one around by <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> it s in the way it barely made contact make sure the fans saw that the bunt a hooker the carry for three yards but like you say that s one of those clear bright line in the rulebook if that happens yeah because you have to give the officials and really defensive gary kubiak he s sitting there all the way at the other end of the field and here comes the ball and he just doesnt see the official either and usually the head coach is the one that is the farthest forward on that line and those are often the guys that have to watch out as <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> tomlin will tell you as well the train from thanksgiving night is both with pittsburgh game with a signature so dominic quarter for the broncos simeon going up top <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> got it put a touchdown we beat <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">phillip gaines</person> twice on that drive let s check the flag the illegal contact number 38 details the fine the last thing <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> said when he left practice shelby some love in this game william here comes a little love i tell you that s the fastest ive seen two guys then two plays go all the way down the field and there s stevenson on the outside who really has made a difference it hasnt been perfect but it s been better and just enough on that plan for <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> about those plays backtoback <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> makes the extra point denver on top 35 yards take carrier head coach 11 of 15 yards let s take it back a little bit farther <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> gets a touch down at the six games without and back on top dallas one on thanksgiving minnesota lost in detroit full week arrest what a scene itll be the cowboys at what ten in a row well have it for you thursday night football on nbc nfl network streamed live on twitter see the next two games of the 1001 cowboys where the nbc two weeks of tonight against the giants the only team to beat them what happened on the touchdown chris well youve got <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> playing center field and i think as youll see phillip gains when he crosses the goal line is going to turn around and he s looking at <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> who worked his way to the opposite side of the field but generally when you see somebody coming all the way across the formation and your guys in trouble youre hoping for help youre just never assured of getting it that time <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">eric berry</person> worked yet no who s hagen who there may be kubiak should be hunted him well because the 15yard penalty it meant was too long plays he had 99 yards receiving on that drive at that beat <person player="jeff heuerman" race="UNK" position="TE">jeff</person> janis remember that to play on c at 101 on that pumpkin hail mary and all the thing creep a arizona divisional playoff game you guys had that classic last year well a desiree play marques where offsides hasbro s at its but by space 9 yard game you are first and five were second and one that probably takes second of one five yards is not a shock side number 94 defense penalty is declined second out i tell you what i dont know how many different ways i could get the ball to tyree kill but id sure be trying and you know this is a guy that strapped together pretty good too we were talking to <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> reed about said you know and he could play running back he s not a small guy so you dont have to worry about wearing about for the fake to get the first down of the run with <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where to the 37 yard line as we approach seven minutes left we meant to the great night with <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> van <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> as well <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> was given a half sack on one we werent sure about theyve credited him with a full sack from the one at the end of the first half so he now has three sexes on the night there you go i tell you what though put that one in your mind that fake reverse he because had they handed it off it would have been open they had a lead blocker in front trust me the guys that are sitting up in the coaching booth have that one with a little star next to it now davis the right guy smith at davis to the left gotta get to town see the middle pass incomplete intended for <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> good crowd theyre working against cory nelson inside and a great throw by <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> even protecting his guy just couldnt come up with it game like this you have to make all those kinds of plays you know those are the ones cuz now youre second and ten and weve seen it all night second and ten third long and the 37degree a full packet no run davis up the middle hell only pain maybe two yards third and along seven coming up he s starting to look at that clock spinning down fast and they only get the ball if youre lucky one more time here on the kansas city some kind of wish this when youre go to overtime im doing the math here how a teen 68 watch this but all night football booties three first downs an accomplishment now on the move smith rules and cruiser cant seem to complete coverage underneath <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> at work he is seeing more and more time in the defensive secondary of denver there he goes there sevens right there and he is a big long lean guy and you exactly right he is the one more and more and he was the guy at the combine i remember him they have like seven different events and he was in the top five and five of those so he s one of those freakish kind of athletes and we saw it when he jumped over bought that extra point for the gamewinner in new orleans two weeks ago brock goes off there by six hated us to kick it away under six minutes secures it at the seven knees down mark about the 11 good kick 53 to give them space only a four yard return that s all dependent on the flat yeah looked like <person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kayvon webster</person> where the whole theyre gonna be back during the kick holding number 36 the receiving team after this for the goal of first down timeout will happen at their own six they have a onepoint lead 537 remaining in regulation and fc represented the last three super bowls by other seattle or carolina theyll go head to head theyve had a couple of burgers a playoff games the last two years seahawks atop the division desperation for the panthers get the great northwest football night in america started 7th eastern for seattle time here on nbc the nagi takes denver back to the 4 to start this drive and the tunis loss of a yard for devante hooker to start the drug you have to be careful here remember holding in the end zone is a safety could another safety in this situation be the difference in this game and there s tomba alley down he made the tackle and requires medical attention here for what a dynamic leader of this organization that guy has met you talk to anybody in kansas city s organization they all say the same thing just follow whatever tom hollie does such a great player for so long take the other guy you better keep your eye on in this situation he s been a bit of a nightmare as <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> number 95 he has been disruptive many and still need about two or three yards just to have a legitimate cut opportunity here i just cant imagine though theyre going to give <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon too many shots that throw from the end zone because of that possibility of folding in the end zone they could flip this score but restarts after hollies off the field so this will take us inside of five minutes with this snap the fullback <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy janovich</person> in there in front of <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> there s no place to go absolutely no place where keane nunez roaches <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> all stacked it up here comes third down lutz <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> just slither in here and make this tackle eight men in the box up there basically just daring denver to throw the ball youll have man coverage take your shot ill tell you the other guy we havent mentioned much tonight after that opening little story about a <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> apparently he s been pitching a shutout out there he loves to take gamble s get to mary s thomas up here i really want to be throwing that way third and a level they throw it at all they empty the backfield so here it goes simeon flood for the first down by a jkirby the titanic huge edition they feel like he could be to bolster that position and that s a massive first out for denver look what <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> samia did he drifts away from <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> what a good idea that was and then there he is the guy that they got for that specific reason anytime youre trading with the new england patriots youre always a little worried are you doing the right thing or not but for this franchise they needed that middle of the field receiver and they got one in <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> what a huge conversion that was 335 kansas city a couple of timeouts the twominute warning get the ball back nope it needs a field goal again who knows roaches having an outstanding game stops devante <person player="devontae booker" race="UNK" position="RB">booker</person> at a time out for kansas city at 3:27 to go attention time <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simian in the for home games he had played it only throwing two touchdowns chrissie has thrown two here in this second half we talked about the opportunity ahead for him boys been very good in this hat has really been grated he has that last drive what he just did there clutch line movement there im gonna see what they got <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> in the slot to flinch false start number 10 offense fiveyard penalty second out it s all explained whenever you hear 75,000 people at the same time go like my dad when i ran a red if fiveyard penalty is you dont think much in this game as weve seen with field positions so huge quick count simeon escaping running forward much garbage as he could it begins to the 23 yard line three yards shy but its third and manageable now timeout kansas city he just gotta love it when a young kid knows he s playing for his career it s a five man rush so there s not really room to step up and he just sort of slithers between here but watch him here john elway like were not sitting down or not sliding in the game s on the line with one more first down let s go get it you think to marius thomas play basketball in his time thomas downfield was throw a little pick there nice job on the outside by <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson has it been perfect no has it been better yes shadows are massive here if you play that position it s elway its manning osweiler was supposed to be here and he leaves heck when people bring up around here in the last week or so maybe tony romo if he s not with dallas next year this poor kid is everywhere he turns he s hears it but he s performing so well in a big spot right now i havent heard gary kubiak laughed that hard in a while when i brought that up uhhuh so denver s out of timeouts there s 3:12 left this is a kansas city s out of timeouts i should say this is a huge stop for them they bring pressure sent me in up top it s caught touchdown echoes there s a flag if it stands at 76 yards flag is at the 33yard line in the den for been cherry almost the similar spot to where the bump happens kubiak before looks like there s no foul play there s no foul so they just drop their flag so it s a 76yard touchdown to make it 23 16 i mean what <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon just did they set that house after him and he pulled a john elway totally under control and wanna throw mattis extra point now cant you see the touchdown a twopoint conversion to tie the game with no timeouts and three minutes left you cant block it when they send everybody this is called a zero blitz and <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">gaines</person> has him oneonone no help anywhere but it was <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon who saw the coverage do exactly what it was just floated high over the top everybody s blitzen what a play you have to be happy for that just have to be happy for him but the one thing it does do <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> is it gives kansas city the ball back and theyre just down one score and a twopoint conversion benny <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> had a touchdown against the chargers he s the guy who can forever say i caught peyton manning s last pass it wasnt an official pass attempt that <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> caught it was a twopoint conversion in the super bowl but that s benny <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> s one line of infamy that s a big one here one that matters a lot as simeon goes over 300 yards 325 which is not what you thought would happen when he watched the first half of this one only in a game like this you see grown men playing pattycake the rost of emotions all the way back and out of the back of the end zone hell frustrated pk s hands on it well you cant do it better than this <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon here in the second half he starts out with a manual saying once <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">sanders</person> twice third down and 11 got to get out of your own endzone or you have to put it back and then this the floater over the top zero blends they brought the house after the kid and they have the answer to leave he knows who he wants his quarterback to pay after philip sun he s paying the price here go the chiefs down it down to get a touchdown smith homeless lost the ball somehow kept it alive as he s brought down insect <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek wolfe</person> with that bandaged harness right elbow got in there one more time you get the outside rusher and then you get the inside rusher and then you get a second you cant just sitting without timeouts two and a half to go chris coghlan convert quiet bitch to farm on <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> jr got the sack yardage back his denver team s been uncanny in the fourth quarter this year hot tub or the ice tank or whatever is going to be full with these women they have laid it all because you have the 14o here to the rest of the season theyve outscored their opponents by 90 points in the fourth quarter this season 30:10 got two gowns to get it out of timeouts the only chances on this drive smith rose kelsey hangs on where will the forward progress be will it be enough just kept walking forward there the floating spot puts it on the line 35 because it was a touch back touching the line is a first down no need to measure were gonna get to the twominute warning do they get a plan before that they do just before 13 yards with tom lee so kansas city get that first first down at a twominute drive it always builds momentum and here we go inside it too and the chiefs go down again a touchdown in a tube and get chris s wish more broncos capes folks maggot postgame report coming up the shell will talk to the stars of the game bob will speak with tony dungy a to the cowboys and vikings on thursday and the panthers seahawks on sunday on nbc final two minutes chiefs out of timeouts at 1st and 10 at <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> is the back next ill expect it puts it up towards kent c in completing the flag down a lot <person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">webster</person> says nothing not me molding number 36 defense fiveyard penalty automatic first down <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> basically just runs right into <person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kayvon webster</person> and gonna kind of drive him back right here and then maybe a grab at the top of this route technically chain <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> out <person player="shane ray" race="UNK" position="DE">shane ray</person> rushing off the edge 151 sighs unabated to the quarterback so they killed the play bot side number 58 he fence fiveyard penalty still first down watch the center s head <person player="mitch morse" race="UNK" position="OG">mitch morse</person> and see if he gives a little snap here yeah he s got us gave it a little snap of the head and i think mine <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> thought he had a key in the hours that d line coaches and d lineman spam looking for just that one edge one little tip at the 42yard line we killed man goes down at the 33 got the first down most like you felt you couldnt get any more so let me save some time save something 90 seconds to go but the 34 with work in the middle kelsey can hang on became acquainted <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="LB">marshall</person> the linebacker id say im so impressed with <person player="brandon marshall" race="nonwhite" position="LB">brandon marshall</person> on the job he s done he s had such a tough job he had to take over for danny trevathan and that straightup mantoman coverage rolling and getting great tight ins you end up getting great running backs coming out and he has just been true to form all season long there s your leader of that defense out there makes all the signal calls well there s the leader but the other guy makes the calls he s out to kill <person player="shaquil barrett" race="UNK" position="LB">barrett</person> in the game rotating these x rushes down the stretch <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> back in go and kelsey afghani hangs on ward makes the tackle yard shy of the first down spitting clock to bucking teeth to go well you can just about count on it anytime you get kelsey one on one with anybody it s no insult anybody on anybody that s where <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> months ago third and one now calmly but it makes the catch the 19 you got the first down again no time outs of kansas city theyve struggled mightily in the red zone second worst team in the league in the red zone now they got to punch it in to have a chance for a tying two point conversion down to 40 seconds left time shot to the end zone is it back to lead a keith to leave goes hide a tip and await it for connolly there s a penalty marker down the back end it s in the secondary the middle of the field illegal contact number 43 defense fiveyard penalty <person player="tj ward" race="nonwhite" position="DB">tj ward</person> the safety watch to leave he s got the underneath coverage and because nobody came into flat and allowed him to drop back think that was <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> who almost got there but im not sure that connelly wouldnt have had that ball otherwise and it would have counted 35 seconds left chiefs at the broncos 14 they learned were both in the game and ellen motion smith go on the other side look it end zone again bound for alberta wilson wrote me just got a road of all the way that sidewalk defensively you have the advantage now they dont have all day if they complete something in the middle of the field you make the tackle and now it s scrambled drill time to try and get the next one off same thing happens if you get a sack obviously that puts a great deal of pressure in this situation once again kelsey to the right smith swings to back this way it s a canned request cant bring it in it was chipped and incomplete third and ten with 25 seconds left <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> had to put one more thing on the resume at night a tip pass there s still time to complete one in the middle of the field get up to the line of scrimmage third down here so if you do that and you dont pick up the first down you cant run up and spike it so you have to have two plays here just in case that happens she backed me into the floor to get that first down finally wont receive her bottom screen smith look at middle looking into him completely harris was there in coverage quilts in the intended receiver and were not a fourth down i dont know how many games ive done or <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> was involve in so many times tonight he is covered has just been blanket we almost ended it right keeps going let s play clock fourth down five smith gets rid of it it is caught and it s a first down out of bounce with hill with 15 seconds left they needed ten he got eleven and a couple of cracks at the end zone now and then <person player="bradley roby" race="UNK" position="DB">roby</person> looked like he had a shot to hit him and all you had to do was stop him short of the line right there let s see if he because he was not at the first down marker hill had to turn up here and if <person player="bradley roby" race="UNK" position="DB">roby</person> could have made that hit oh my goodness won the game this is fitting it will come down to this first and goal from the three no timeouts for kansas city crashers smith against the blitz its sudden is he s just shot that clark is running kansas said he s got to get up and get the bomb and ray thought was a touchdown the officials stopped it with one second theyre going to look at it upstairs we will review the previous play oh goodness i thought he got in and i first saw it they werent going to get a snap off two oclock it knee goes down when you see there we go where is the knee down down there is it down what does he have some phone get chris see he doesnt get possession of the ball till the very end which would work in his favor yes he s so good if this is not possession it actually works in his favor because if he controls it there you have the touchdown oh my goodness there are so many things at work and is it clear and obvious in this situation because the call on the field is short it has to be a hundred percent sure for the replay center to overturn it and remember now because there s one second kansas city is going to have to be ready yes and im sure the officials will let them know being that they market there theyre going to wind the clock and you have to have that play ready and it s going to be on the whatever sixinch line at worst is there control i would argue it when he got control he was over there line or at least on that line which is the same thing as over them again when do you have control of the ball and at that moment where is the ball and because of the bobble catching it in his body seems like he s secured it after the contact of the defender and we could be looking at 24 22 in a twopoint conversion coming up yeah and <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> reed may have to have two plays ready one if he has to get a touchdown and one if he has to get the twopoint conversion as one thing sometimes they stay with the call on the field because there s not enough evidence youve got all the evidence there i think that s what they were hearing to play when the receiver had complete control of the ball he was in the end zone it is a touchdown constructor game they put it back at 12 because that s when it happens give me a little more time on the clock but of course we have the twopoint conversion e which is the most important play coming up and im gonna guess theyre gonna put tyree killed in a very important position here so youll see the bobble just not under control and then when it was on the line kansas city has gone for two once this year it has been healthy and they converted one thing we have not seen tonight is that jet sweep that they like do to tyree kill where basically he lines up comes in short motion and they turn around and hand him the ball for the two for the time smith will roll it hell throw it and it is popular to buy dimitri s harris a lot of people to meet reason harris who didnt play football in college was a basketball player in wisconsin milwaukee hasnt caught a ball in three games anytime times the game they didnt even have basketball or football at the school here we go what s he gonna do he s gonna play basketball let s go get some rebound position right here box out <person player="chris harris" race="nonwhite" position="DB">chris harris</person> and there you go can you believe six seven 230 using every bit of that space and harris couldnt even get around him guy three catches two years ago seven catches have touchdown last year he s got ten balls this year but they dont target a munchin in the big spots it ties the game at 24 only has ten catches on the year and let s give a little credit one way to <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> at this point right he had to answer that entire drive that went the other way all the momentum going away the denver broncos and here he comes right back to tie it up there was no game managing that was game winning yeah what he s like hey what do you want me to do you want me to play the lead you want me be safe i can be saved you let me go get a win go get a twopoint conversion you got it know what i like about you you will flip also much youve seen a lot of football the last few weeks and you said i want overtime and youre gonna get your wish you dont likelihood it s good by me im checking the rest of the food everybody okay with that absolutely all good you know every once in while you see a game were just two teams fight their guts out you know and that s what s happened out here tonight you just asked for anything more in a big game never does empty timeouts 12 seconds left at the ball the 25yard line course youre at altitudes have no chance for the long field goal here but reasonably with the two timeouts youd have to get there somewhere near the 35 yard line to get a crack at it maybe the 40 yard line to try a 58 yard field goal with <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> so youre looking at have to cover about 35 yards at 12 seconds with two timeouts and what this game means one more time especially with that oakland victory or lose this would be too bad the denver is neither going to think about using this timeout to take it a shot to take this to overtime youre at home that s probably the right choice that s all you need to do throw it down to eric barry let him run it back for a touchdown already did that to carolina right remember that s how that s how the first matchup between these teams last year ended in that thursday night game you thought the thing was over and then pulling the defensive score change the game was that boom in honor of john man sure was of course it wasnt everyone s a bit bitter saga a tremendous night for these two stud pass rushers off the edge although <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> was held in check a bit chris in that second half and allow denver to get rhythm and success on the offensive end yeah you just have to wonder how healthy is you know he went out for a time maybe the shoulders hurting a little bit but this guy for him to come back this soon the suddendeath overtime period eats him each team will have the opportunity to possess the football unless the first team that possesses the ball scores a touchdown defensive score there will be two timeouts each by each team and all replays will be done from the replay booth this is heads this is tails youre the visitor what he gonna call heads heads is the call tails it is youve won the toss you want to receive mercy denver won the toss elected to receive at this end so we go again to overtime on a sunday night and well be right back after these messages from your local nbc station overtime here in denver all even at 20 for the broncos well get at first <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> sybian over 300 yards most passing yards of his brief nfl career terrific second half and to city response capri dibs is back deep to receive the kick twice over time has ended with a kickoff return for touchdown in nfl history jairo <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> with the kickoff itll come out to the 25 starla game from kansas city has been tyree kill we discussed him earlier in the broadcast scoring and score in different ways the first rookie with a rushing receiving and return touchdown in the game since 1965 and the great gale sayers and this was the one in the final seconds not getting possession there until he was at the goal line and that s why the fans were booing pete morelli is it s anybody who represented that call they were unhappy thinking that it should have been dad in front of the goal seven yards before philip <person player="phillip gaines" race="white" position="DB">gaines</person> made the tackle <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> they came out with two deep safeties that time because of the fact theyve been getting burned in that man coverage so what do they turn around do here we go were just gonna run the football then in that situation so this city willing to stay with that remember it has been full of gains that theyve been getting after for the big plays debra touchdown wins the game possess fear of overtime try that run again to the left and if he s going to get credit for the tackle but the penetration of her cave nunez roaches the second round pick out a southern miss a factor there there s no doubt about it and it s been so impressive to see the kansas city chiefs basically with backups and draft picks playing along that defensive line looking as good as they ever have i mean this is a prideful bunch but these are a bunch of guys that maybe two months ago you would have said theyre definitely not playing for the kansas city chiefs jeromy s <person player="jarvis jenkins" race="nonwhite" position="DT">jenkins</person> is in there here s with the jets for most of the first half of this season but throw on 31 with simeon the 45 <person player="eric berry" race="UNK" position="DB">berry</person> there along with <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> they work on <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> in a big spot and thomas comes through yeah well you better hang on to the football because that s the really the first time that weve seen <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">marcus peters</person> giving up a play and it was the carolina game where he basically stole it at the end of the game on a catch very similar to that and turned that game around kelvin benjamin reception late in that game is one of the chiefs comeback victories that theyve had this year the 45 play action simeon can play a lot of cheats hands werent very close to that one intended for <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">jordan taylor</person> boy that was her meet wilson there s her look at him on the outside here comes <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> going against games watch the linebacker it goes right over his hands i thought remy quill sen was gonna catch that one youll see it right down the throwing lane here and just couldnt quite get up high enough to get that just on the federative by game s tug on the back of <person player="jordan taylor" race="white" position="WR">taylor</person> s jersey get in front of them ready to give away the pass as well taking the chat thing vince only two yards third and eight coming up <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">kendall reyes</person> joining tava holly on the tackle in the <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">reyes</person> working on <person player="max garcia" race="UNK" position="C">max garcia</person> and just shuts the block and makes the plate going right there watch this one stand them up extend your arms throw them aside make the play beautiful rocko s have always been successful over time fi they have the most overtime regularseason wins in league history three last year including the sunday night o right on this time of the year against the patriots at <person player="cj anderson" race="nonwhite" position="RB">cj anderson</person> run of 48yarder third name here this to the 30 23 yards so many times it s when you get your backs on a linebacker as it happened here youve got <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> bouncing out there and then you devante parker who was an excellent receiver coming out of college making a huge play there <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="juwan thompson" race="UNK" position="RB">thompson</person> you could tell what that achilles still limping around basically 22 on the reception range with the touchdown and sigma3 bits served up in the backfield he loses two yards on that one it s quarterback got him like <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon tripped him because as soon as he tapped that left foot well let s take a look here makes the cut it s hard enough right four minutes gone in overtime on second twelve simian get up top flag is down and the passing complaint <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> was trying to get open <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth</person> anger when it wasnt coverage maybe against the chiefs passionate parents number 27 deep end automatic push down any time to get the oneonones on the outside and here s young <person player="kenneth acker" race="UNK" position="DB">kenneth</person> thacker watch how much physical presence there is is a huge <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> just kept forcing his way to the outside to get that jump ball thrown and there you go and so now this kansas city defense that gives up a lot of yards but it just been so good and so dynamic in the red zone gotten so many turnovers down here all season long and they do it one more time exhausted first tennis 20 cooker no gain actor who was flagged on the last play makes this one in the run game it s amazing when you played at that level of intensity for four quarters and you say im just gonna give it everything i have and then here comes this fifth quarter and you can just see it on their faces out there theyre all going for oxygen theyre all trying to catch their breath theyre all still find their guts out doing it at altitude little edge of the broncos a little deeper right now because of injuries and also coming off a bye week second intensity escaping the cow from behind <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> kitson itll be a run gain of a yard as <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> finally ended up making the play yeah they had it set up they were basically going here s <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> on the outside and they had a double move going to <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> at the top of the screen and it just didnt work out nicely covered that time by <person player="marcus peters" race="nonwhite" position="DB">peters</person> who is always a little susceptible to those plays that answered the bell on that one to play clowns who couldnt find anything first downs was sooo tough to come by in the first quarter that figured things out as theyve gone along protections just a well coached well played game third and nine we push his offensive tackle trying to block him right into simeon and comes up with the sack he rode <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell</person> oh whoo and right back to the quarterback when <person player="russell okung" race="nonwhite" position="OT">russell</person> kuhn kicks that back left leg back youll see him set it behind him here and at that point the bull rush you have no chance whatsoever once that foot gets back like that it is just a straight bull rush right back into the quarterback and that takes care of that <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">brandon mcmanus</person> from 44 if you werent with us earlier thomas cafard the snapper just got here a few days ago perfect big managedcare is good yeah i had it all the way brother to the cheese touch downwind over time goes on they dont score the continues in a minute <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> what a terrific drive at the end of the game <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon was fabulous in the second half in a quarterback town where he had not had those good home games simeon has been really good against an outstanding kansas city defense considering how many times he s guys been sacked and hit and jostled and taken off the spot he stepped up good performances tonight and his offensive tyree kill has been a big part of the kansas city story it s gonna be brought out by d anthony thomas he hesitated to sign sabrina and thomas comes down the sideline across the 30 against the 34 yard line <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> the kicker had to hickam out of hit him out of bounds well we found a new star in this league tyree kill starts off with a little 86 yard return of a free kick after his safety and he hit the jets and you could forget about catching him at that point that wasnt enough here we go were gonna hand it to him on a little jet sweep around the outside some good blocks will scored that way and then with one second on the clock controversy maybe but touchdown yes and there we more drive so used to seek touchbacks here in denver flags down at the bay too many men out there defensively before the spire can snap prior to stab we had 12 men on the field defense fiveyard penalty phil first down so instead of getting the drive to start at the 25yard line you get the kick return which was rare here to the 35 and now the five on this so you gotta start the 40yard line for kansas city and i think it was <person player="kayvon webster" race="nonwhite" position="DB">kayvon webster</person> who is trying to call for a timeout as he was running off the field but because they dont want you using that as a delay tactic at the ends of games that came up in the super bowl right and as we he forget about if they have 12 on the field ill take the penalty and run the clock all those things that s why it was put in so it s pushed in five special away maybe 1/2 yard not much again she s touchdown to the wind tie to extend the game they dont score they lose kansas city goes three tight ends to creek hill in the game as they spread the feel of denver and for smith underneath for the first down by hill at the 46 yard line you know <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> it was a great strategy there they put three tight ends in the game to make it look like it was going to be a power run kind of formation and then what did they do they spread the whole field and you could see denver scrambling around trying to figure out which one of those linebackers was going to have to go out and coverage and make a play pick up the first down nicely done that time by <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> the couple offensive cortez maggie with young quarterback coach he shares the job with brad childress the former vikings head coach really good offensive minds back seat to him does distract with m4 defenses sharked hazard <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> s stop gain of a couple grand marshal and <person player="demarcus ware" race="nonwhite" position="DE">demarcus ware</person> the stop i know weve about worn you out on five <person player="von miller" race="UNK" position="LB">miller</person> but the things that he does is really kind of remarkable he was three yards up the field that time stopped circled back and got in on this play this is watch this back underneath and still the kids out on the play if the viewers been worn out what do you think kansas city feels at this ground and their thing and we got a play this is the three tight end look again were off the edge does it get there the stickers pop by kelsey <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> in the 31 yard line pickup of 21 yards of the first down they just do that double n cut here bring the guy inside look at those moves i love the moves by the tight end oh my goodness he had better moves than i did this has a little wiggle at the top of his routes theyre so clever for a big guy they just are just slipping away yeah let s keep it going man this blend score a touchdown get out of here seven catches tonight joey the offensive line away from the whoopie tackle by <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stewart</person> it turns what would have been a loss of yardage into a game to the 25yard line it is a good thing that chain rake and run because there was nobody else left out there watch this jump cut first of all set it up and now it s just the footrace with <person player="shane ray" race="UNK" position="DE">shane ray</person> on the outside because there was one safety in the middle of field and that was about it nice runs by where when the better looking run to the night for kansas city theyve been doing the same look all night <person player="travis kelce" race="UNK" position="TE">travis kelce</person> one way three receivers the other way youre six minutes left at over top less to the left first down florida <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">charcandrick west</person> at the 20yard line of this gray over there again on the stop also watch the clock here at overtime we got a five and a half left so if kansas city scores a field goal is not going to be a ton of time left to break the tie okay i dont want to times you know <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> what theyre doing though theyre starting to at least show that jets we now theyre using tyreke hill almost as a diversion coming across well see if sooner or later they give it to it s nile davis as the running back now davis it sucks <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stewart</person> doesnt as that it depends <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stewart</person> comes down tags him after a gain of a yard inside of five minutes left in ot i mean the play is so good darren <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stewart</person> came from ten yards deep to make that play basically at the line of scrimmage it s just first class defensive play that weve seen all night long books formation three receivers and <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> were heads over there so they have floor to that side kelsey to the top smith trying to throw it underneath have we heard a whistle yet ready complete pass be third down fun hilary it would be more exquisite the arm was going for and right now wade <person player="john phillips" race="white" position="TE">phillips</person> is adjusted as well they are taking kelsey to that one receiver side up there and they are brain safety help over the top so they shifted him down here to the three receiver side demetrios harris on the other side she s taking time out here before third and not time out kansas city first team timeout 30second timeout one of the two they have in overtime we look at those hits chris so often the first thing were worried about did the ball come out we forget about this gotta hurt well there s no question when your elbow is flexed like that you can see you know you can imagine the torque on that elbow when youre throwing a football or a baseball or whatever and all of a sudden somebody hits that arm im sure it s sore and im also sure <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> s not coming out of the game unless it just doesnt work anymore he s going to throw a couple of balls on the side it was a good time out that s a great plan since it s such a veteran coach <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> he so it million got the two timeouts at overtime but he cant afford to not be completely ready for this play and if your decision maker and guy s going to throw it for you isnt right make sure <person player="spencer ware" race="UNK" position="RB">spencer</person> where will be the battle three kills right on that 39 slot here the spring pressure it s for kelsey couldnt get his head turned around in time his contact there s no flag is justin sentences again in coverage and here comes <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">cairo santos</person> to continue the game there s definitely some contact on the tail end of this let s just take a look up no foul really nicely done by the officials sometimes those calls are so tough and really well played that time by <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> the young player there s pressure numbers this from 37 to continue the game if he misses the broncos way and the game goes on with only 419 left here in overtown 27 apiece next score wins and what has been a terrific one tonight each team to long drives yielding field goals so the next score wins this game and the prospect perhaps of a third time in the nfl this season perhaps an unintended consequence or a result of the change in the overtime rules where that first possession field goal doesnt win it the other team gets a chance to match it and as weve seen the more ties than we had in the past but there s still a lot of time between now and then 419 left in this extra period <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> kicks capri bibs 27 all think players have had a good game on the offensive end chris this guy <person player="emmanuel sanders" race="nonwhite" position="WR">emmanuel sanders</person> he s something else he really is not only is he the deep threat he s also that quick guy underneath they can create some space and pick up some easy first downs and i think that just his second 100yard game of the year and im sure <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simians got to be thinking what do i have to do to win this game we keep going down and taking the lead and were still not winning devante <person player="victor ochi" race="UNK" position="LB">victor</person> the running back as the second ot possession begins city drifting a space to run probably down after a gain of eight get out of bounds of for ten months will be second to two it s exactly what they were looking for out of <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon we havent seen him run much but since he hurt that shoulder he just wasnt running at all and for gary kubiak he thought that so many of their key first downs in the first month of the season came from his legs and coming out and making plays and boys second and short sets up some big opportunities you want to take a shot down the field this is always a good time for that put their ups on the first down to the 38yard love the g <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> with me catch earlier help clear the path <person player="derek wolfe" race="white" position="DE">derek</person> <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">johnson</person> slow to get off of the broncos running back got a good block down and then it was <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> coming across lock it down right here and then a kickout coming right across here from <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> and <person player="michael schofield" race="UNK" position="OT">schofield</person> genève a good preseason <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> did with new england youre not gonna get a lot of time with gronk and martellus bennett up there but he s factoring in here for the broncos throughout capri fits the back blitz coming semi gets rid of it he completely extended for <person player="demaryius thomas" race="nonwhite" position="WR">demaryius thomas</person> with phillip games close by and i knew it wasnt gonna be long bob sutton it s not the type to sit back and go okay let s just let him go down and kick a field goal here brought both inside linebackers that time and now they have something to work with here comes the dime defense on the field and this is their favorite look this is what they like <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> directing the pass rush traffic hell start from the inside again snow with bitsy dives forward to be three yards shy of the first down with 320 left it over top that was some effort that time by <person player="kendall reyes" race="UNK" position="DT">kendall reyes</person> because that one had a chance of breaking out of there came from the back side and made a diving stop denver has two timeouts there is a twominute warning in overtime i think this is exactly why they came up with <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> it wouldnt surprise me at all here if he s the receiving threat he s 83 s on the three and third and three we have a wizard at the timeout taken by broncos denver first team timeout 30second timeout so each team with one timeout left youre almost kind of in that old overtime mentality right now get it down in field goal range here go another 20 23 yards or so give <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> is shot at it it would be a gamewinner what do you think the raiders are cheering for here at i probably right then they still have game and a half on everyone every but that point exactly so their cheer for the clock it s those plans and you got cheese fans and you got clocked fans at the end of this thing and and the point with the raiders that will reiterate again with these teams down the stretch they have to go on the road to play all these teams and through all of this and were talking about the three in the afc <person player="charcandrick west" race="UNK" position="RB">west</person> somehow someway philip rivers in san diego gonna be right in the mix deciding what happens he wants to play there nobody oh chris it s <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> who keeps this drive go it s all you want you just want the oneonone matchup that time against the safety <person player="daniel sorensen" race="UNK" position="DB">daniel sorensen</person> right here here comes <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">derby</person> little pushoff baby croc taught him that when he was in new england but those are the kind of conversions that just make huge differences in an offense and especially for a young quarterback who needs that threat in the middle the one spot that <person player="trevor siemian" race="white" position="QB">trevor</person> simeon has really struggled this year is between the numbers between zero and ten yards he s made big mistakes in there and you can just see that comfort now starting to develop with <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> so we have hit the overtime twominute warning there at the 44 from here a field goal of 62 yards they eat another first down or so to get a realistic shot at a gamewinning field goal your five delete for <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">donald</person> stevenson first fourth kansas city chris he lost his starting job but came back in this game has had a huge impact yeah he has at least he s not the bleeding a little bit on the outside and <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">justin houston</person> has to be completely exhausted just playing his second game and for <person player="donald stephenson" race="nonwhite" position="OG">stephenson</person> it s not always pretty he just punching and staying in front doing whatever he can but his block there in time for <person player="aj derby" race="UNK" position="TE">aj derby</person> to get open and knowing <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> being a chief you wonder if that knowledge has helped him in this case here needing about six seven yards finishing a full range vince is the back end he is going to be right about the line of scrimmage is not behind <person player="derrick johnson" race="nonwhite" position="LB">derrick johnson</person> the tackle kansas city only has one timeout with 1:45 left so it looks like <person player="alex smith" race="white" position="QB">alex smith</person> might not get his hands back on the ball let s denver misses a field goal well and plus you want to run this clock down all you can because if you happen to miss that thing you dont want to leave it there right but you know you got to get the first i have get more yardage here at the 44 now 62 yard field goal attempt it would be <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> long 57 course we are at altitude got oneonone coverage on the outside if you want to throw one deep second he tends to be look in that way pass is deflected and knocked down incomplete will have third and ten coming up there s <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> one more time getting that hand up and one of the things they talked about with <person player="chris jones" race="nonwhite" position="DT">chris jones</person> is he s a rare guy bob sutton was saying this that can push the pocket and then still be athletic enough to jump he said a lot of times those guys who are just sit at the line of scrimmage to get no pressure whatsoever theyre the ones that block the passes this guy gets pressure and blocks passes this is a pressure play a lot of decisions to be made if you dont get anything there s ten the chiefs are bringing pressure simeon puts it on top it is complete fourth power benny <person player="bennie fowler" race="UNK" position="WR">fowler</person> with phillip gage has been beaten a lot here tonight now in his fourth and tenth the 44 yard line do you try a 62 third field book is like you said it gives kansas city great field position be a minute here jody kamil s the special teams coach is there i dont know if you can take that kind of chance kenya as long in his career is 57 almost have to punt this football and again it is cold you know the temperature here is in the low 40s upper 30s michelle well i talked to <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">brandon mcmanus</person> before the game now he told me he could convert 60 yards in either direction going in this direction in the pregame he converted a 55 yard or but again he said he could convert from 60 and the wind has really died down here not much of a factor at all <person player="mike person" race="white" position="OT">mike</person> it has michelle and it would be 62 from here with the ball at the 44 so kubiak takes a timeout this is what one of those because if you attempt the field goal from that spot you would give kansas city the ball to denver 48 yard line i just cant imagine you can do that so then what do you do to your punchy do you go for it punt it right i think you got a permit because the putt then the scenario is overtime our tires should say yeah well here comes <person player="brandon mcmanus" race="white" position="K">mcmanus</person> trotting out the longest overtime field goal in nfl history sebastian janikowski 57 yards alright let me just say this if you have some sort of trick play to try and draw them off sides here maybe when you want to go with this because at that point you lose nothing you still punt the football at least go out there see if theyll jump you know i think kansas they just talked about that because tyreke hill had come on the field thinking the missed short field goal could be returned by a player then hill went back and they put more of a defensive mode out there to just protect lana s field on nfl history was made here <person player="matt paradis" race="white" position="C">matt</person> prater 64 yards in jason elam 63 this is 62 would be the longest overtime gamewinning field on lady history no good and now kansas city will get the ball at the 48 yard line of the broncos and theyre only a first down or so away from winning this game with no timeouts in a minute three left this decision is so interesting this kick just put too hard he may have had a shot at it had it been nailed straight but now youre giving them the ball on your side of the 50 gutsy move the kairo <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> hopes now that his team can get a first down <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> as long as 54 yards that was made at <person player="justin houston" race="UNK" position="LB">houston</person> so that would mean get a first down to get in that field goal range and again altitude you add a little bit all right so here we go up to the denver defense 63 seconds rainey in the overtime period is the back swag down playful smith if he can get rid of these scrambles you can talk input yes the 42yard line youre right oh manny had somebody running wide open down the boundary and he just didnt see it over 94 defense fiveyard penalty still first down were jumped us it was a free plug i couldnt tell if he were he was over the line of scrimmage or not but there was somebody just streaking down the boundary by themselves it would have been a walk in touchdown all the way on the outside to the left you see him coming to background i think if there s nobody at all is <person player="albert wilson" race="nonwhite" position="WR">albert wilson</person> repel they still makes it first in five 55 seconds left bottom of the screen again 47 seconds left from here field goals 50 yards we go spiking so wilson there on the end making sure he was on the line of scrimmage there was not a penalty in the last minute with the clock running that would have cost them yards and now the game is completely under the control of <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> and the kansas city chiefs because of the fact that they attempted that field goal now you run the clock down youre gonna try it with maybe five seconds to go you have a timeout left complete control now whatever <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> chooses to do you may want to take a couple of runs see if you can gain a few more yards and then take the shot to win it and thank you they do have one timeout left my mistake denver s out of timeouts second and 10 25 first after the 20 to the 16 yard line the blitz looked like it came off sides with tj warren no flag down but a much more makeable field goal now for kansas city and a rare miss tackle marion <person player="darian stewart" race="nonwhite" position="DB">stewart</person> that time just unable to get kelsey on the ground so good with that run after the catch and now <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> <person player="jah reid" race="UNK" position="OT">reid</person> is but he does leave himself just enough time if in fact this thing were to be bobbled or whatever the first down bad snap you can retry the kick if it s thrown away by the holder now just remember this though what happened in that saints game it was <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> who jumped over the center and it was will <person player="william parks" race="UNK" position="DB">parks</person> who returned it weve seen it multiple times this year i would imagine <person player="andy janovich" race="UNK" position="RB">andy</person> reed has an answer for that one as well but take a little running jump just remember what happened in the overtime game of cincinnati in london against washington look like hopkins had a very short makeable gamewinning field goal he missed it and the game ended up time other guys that keep to leave coming off the edge these kicks as well <person player="justin simmons" race="UNK" position="DB">justin simmons</person> right over the ball <person player="james winchester" race="UNK" position="LS">james winchester</person> snaps dust in <person player="dustin colquitt" race="white" position="P">colquitt</person> holds pyro sasha 34yard attempt believable gamewinner kansas city youve gotta be kidding me oh the only way this game can end holy smokes i didnt know what had happened oh i couldnt tell you to go through or not that thing hit that jan i was hard how did it go through oh it just caught the inside of the uprise and the fans back there thought oh this goes now it is good kairos <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> you see in passing on this side of the post the kids of city chiefs with an incredible comeback down the stretch this guy s defense started it some nights it s your night this guy had a great night deserved a better fate but the decision to go for the long field goal by kubiak left the short field <person player="cairo santos" race="white" position="K">santos</person> off the upright the chiefs win and the volkswagen postgame report is coming up but first these messages from your local nbc station
