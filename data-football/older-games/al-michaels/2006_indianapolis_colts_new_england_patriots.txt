============================================================

Adam Vinatieri is the Colts kicker of course he is a legend in New England froze years with the Patriots in all his game winning at Super Bowl winning kicks and now he will get to play against his former team after being let slip away by Patriots management and out of Gillette Stadium Al Michaels and John Madden with a collie opening kickoff Sunday Night Football Colts and the Patriots take a look at the New England offense Tom Brady Michigan Corey Dillon Seattle Washington Troy brown Marshall rosette called the reverse to the floor Benjamin Watson University of Georgia David Thomas University of Texas at like Purdue University loving Mankins Fresno State dan Kelvin from Boston College Billy Yates Texas A&amp;M Nick Qasr University of Toledo I'm providing great protection for Brady opening the hole he has tackled for a loss of a couple Jason David coming up from the corner let's meet the Colt defense problem Ã«this alabama A&amp;M Anthony mcFarland hello Shu Brian brought to Dwight Freeney Syracuse University yokel Gardner Purdue Gary bracket Rutgers kettle Jun Michigan they call from Fort Valley State Bob Sanders I am Antoine Bethea of power the universe Jason David Washington State University but they a starter was a sixth month pants of the game is a little low and there's a flag as well we shake old wealth the intended receiver the coverage on the plane Nick Harper the past bounced to him in the first flag of the game Ron winter is the referee tonight to give us the call pass interference offense number 87 drinks of half the distance to the goal repeat second down its Bodwell rachet Caldwell's a guy that caught the ball then you say well how did he get open and then you see that this is how he gets open right there he just pushes and then runs a hook now what you try and do is really try and push that defensive back up the field and then come back but you can't literally put your hands on let's say Tom Brady feels a lot more comfortable with his wives receiving tonight than he did the last time we were here has been boy does he Dylan who came over a couple of years ago after sparkling start to his career as a Cincinnati Bengal he takes it up to the 19 yard line it will be third down and 11 and I think having Bob Sanders back for this cold defense is such a big thing because that front seven is a very big room and if you just run right at them you can get the yards in there and that's how people do it but if that safety can come up and be that eight died like Bob Sanders that's the extra guy against the run that one defense very vulnerable teams are averaging five 24 yards per carry against the Colts and that pass is poured for a first down so Benjamin Watson makes it because of the penalty Brady was backedup second and long no problem Watson with a big night the other night on Monday in Minnesota takes us the first year yeah I think one of the underrated groups on this plate for a team is their offensive line I mean Tom Brady does outstanding things but the outstanding pass protection on that allowed him to get the ball to Ben Watson for the first down and he was covered there by Mathis the defensive end who went back into coverage Brady legs to spread it around he had ten different guys against the Lakers six nights ago the pass is caught on a slant and this is sad Jackson a goodlooking rookie out of the University of Florida drafted in the second round he is tackled air by Jason David and it will be a little bit short of a first down doesn't Tom Brady just look like mr. cool I mean I used to say that about Joel Montana that he does the same thing that every other quarterback in the NFL does but he makes it look so much easy especially of late before touchdown before over the ypu second i'm and one year formation and they give it to their looking Mulroney and Mulroney for a first defeat to the Indianapolis 45 yard line that's a gain of 12 from Brody is something special Tony Dungy was talking about him last night he says he really worries it because you know he's strong and then he has the speed to go 80 yards I mean now that's good block in there I mean it you know a little poor tackle watch the left tackle here that light he just takes masters right to the outside and that allows Maroney to get through the whole winter throwing the flag before the snap false start on offense number 74 five yard penalty remains first down at that last play was it was a wham and they the Patriots have been doing this where they bring the tight end in and the tight end comes in and lambs or traps the nosedive we're in one territory James basically it's a 39yard who's the running they say averaging giving up five point four yards per carry and when your run defense has that figure thrown up against them that's terrible I was just talking about that plan wham play and they come back with the same thing right here you'll see here's been watching me here now he's gonna come in and Wham or track the nose time where the heck just wait right there and comes in and tries honey good the straightarm with Memphis takes it inside the 42 the 38 yard line there's no question the Colts and it'll be determined as we all know in January in post season because they've been so good during the regular season but there they are one of two teams starting with the 700 mark and giving up a hundred or more rushing yards in each game that that's sort of a start tonight for than John I was just going to say you should see they're not very big three power right out of a can over like the Patriots are doing right now Dylan that's the first down he takes it to the 34 yard line and already the Patriots have 37 yards on the ground against Indianapolis again we're gonna see we talked about this Wham now watch what they're doing they're using their tight end like an extra lime instead of having five linemen they have the tight end coming in and blocking the interior the defensive lineman Sooey wonder where in the been watching they show the move goes deep and it's intercepted in the end zone it's picked off by the and the workers gonna run with it now he's looking the latter jeez is no doubt in his but he takes it back up to the 31 yard line so but they in a situation where you almost never see the defensive back come out of the endzone that deep in the end zone but he does and he gives into the ball at the 31 yard line when we come back Alvin but Antoine Bethea it gifts the Colts the ball throw 32 vector Michels to the air and Nana's guys down by Rodney Harrison that a hand in front Peyton Manning and if you watch Indianapolis you know that this is par for the course they run the know not necessarily the hurry up depending on the situation the Manning makes all the calls when they get to the line he gets free prize from fob more and then the play from that in the patriot defense tries to counter move them on their side as well it bunched up in the middleman and then second down and ten in the pocket goes to the outside and that fasters incomplete intended for Reggie Wayne we came up with three touchdown receptions last week at Denver here we saw the the Indianapolis no huddle now you watch the Colts on defense and they also have to go with a no huddle position they also been they get the play they have to communicate if the corners stay the safeties time to stay line backers diva communicating with the defensive lineman and the secondary bhai 13:10 the Colts are 50% on 30 10 or more which is phenomenal these the league average is about 18% and now it's going to be more than that B is Tariq Len the left tackle was moving and that should make it third and 15 assuming it is the false start moonstone manning's numbers on third down are simply phenomenal this season a hundred and thirty three rate 12 touchdowns no kicks and as we say they converted on because they're not afraid to throw the ball for the check down these guys will go vertical to the sideline Yancy's Wendy pinky there are two guys there it's torte and Harrison both and Harrison makes the catch and Rodney Harrison is slow to get up so you had two guys both in the same area after Manning had bought time escaped the sack came to the left sideline throws against the grain and Harrison is still down and Roosevelt calls and really hit Peyton Manning just after he threw the ball I mean that's that's Peyton Manning yo you always think to him that he's gonna be in the pocket he's gonna do this but watch his throw and this hit 44 yards knee surgery that was a 44yard of the season and it's a first down for Indianapolis now at the sad Scot normally plays a corner comes in to play Harrison spot and a four star here before the play develops it'll be first in 15 we'll go back to the catch by Harrison you're gonna see see Marvin Harrison his outside Dallas Clark his inside to make a scramble here he thinks it's going to him Harrison makes the same move Harrison catches the ball right in front of Clark and then Tijeras watch 37 Rodney Harrison as he comes down right on his right shoulder the first is 15 after the penalty with an interception and those it's 30 for the Pope's this year they let Edgerrin James go and right now he's dwelling in anonymity with the Arizona Cardinals so roads who had been there for a number of years number one on the depth chart but they also have a goodlooking rookie by the name of Joseph Addai in there he is and we will see a lot of him tonight as he sees more and more actually carefully and he's doing a good job in the passing game possessor Edgerrin James is so good we always think of him as a runner but he was also a good past protective I'm just gonna say additionally gives you if you can't if you can't pass the time stays in there to be his job detection of the pass is caught by Marvin Harrison and when you think about Manning and Harrison they've combined from more catches and more touchdown receptions more for a combination than any two in the history of the National Football League and they just work at it calmly I mean Marvin Harrison is always born from the right side he's done a slaw he's not the website that they work there all the time gone in here and here's Joseph Addai the taking it to the 14 yard line where jr. say how trips him up they loved the Colts did Laurence Moroney in the draft but he was not available so they had other runners they were looking at a dive was one of them they needed somebody to come in and take the place of Edgerrin James and so far so good for a guy who spent most of his career flying from Nick Saban in Baton Rouge Dallas Clark in the slot that's a second insects protection is great and a tornado's Paris injustice in the middle and get free to pick up the first down so Marvin Harrison has already caught three passes on this drive for 61 total yards in its first down and goal yeah we talked earlier about the protection al that Tom Brady had watch the protection of Peyton Manning gets here and when he can stand back there and look left and look right and come back to the middle like this he's going to kill you nobody even got close to him when they're protecting the crown jewel also seeing two of the best centers in football in this game Jeff's added layer always protects the middle but cuts it back in and is tackled at the fiveyard line about ten minutes into the period it'll be second down and goal you know and this is this is where the Colts have been so good I mean it you know that when they get down here in the red area or the red zone they usually get the ball into the end zone is dived again back at the 32 yard line after the Fayette intersection second down and goal Harrison goes in motion and goes back the other way a die as the running back take to your dad the pass to the end zone touchdown so last Sunday it was Reggie Wayne's day and Harrison was the guy who caught a few balls for not much yardage and Wayne was the store but Marvin Harrison tonight spills this crowd and I mean it a silent right now for catches on that drive for 66 yards they go 68 yards total for the touchdown watch Marvin Harrison here he started out right I said he doesn't come in motion but he comes in motion goes back out comes back in Ellis he wasn't even close and then Bennett Airy now in the enemy uniform boots the extra boy born Han to play in the opening period first blood drawn by the Colts seven to nothing Indianapolis the huts outoftheway hall at the NFC champion they were a year ago well Marvin Harrison's added another touchdown reception to his total and the Colts are leading the Patriots seven of them let's get back to Gillette Stadium that they reduced and in Minnesota whoopee back out to the city to yard New England goes to work from that spotless 422 remaining in the opening period Manning in the coats of five seven due to play in the first quarter the Colts turn an interception into a touchdown let's get back out to Al Michaels caught by Troy Brown before the night is done will eclipse the record for most receptions by a patriot that just has tied Stanley Morgan's mark but we have a flag on the play so let's see if it counts ROM winter with the call here this could take a while unsportsmanlike conduct taunting number 80 offense 15 sitting down Braun is deliberate but Browns can be penalized the tax was made along the sideline but then the taunting fall and let's see if we can pick it up on the replay 14year vets what Troy Brown is usually don't taunt I think that's what he's saying where is that talent the only thing that I can think of is Gilbert Gardner was standing there you see them right there 51 that's made by Moroni out in the flat he's tackled there by Robert Malthus but Roy brown isn't the kind of guy that taunts I mean he's not one of the wide receivers Parker type guys in this lake here you see it right here and he's okay there yeah well he's trying to throw it to the official I don't know about that because the official you thought he was there's a guide through the flyer and then a shine caught by gun Gabriel was crated here and Brady didn't even know Gabriel until they got here so these two guys have only known each other for a couple of months have all of a sudden become a very potent there boy and that when that safety comes over and makes that play if we could just stop it right here you'll see the window there's the corner and the safety Bob Sanders is a safety he gets over there a little too late and it's a window on that cover to between the rotated corner and the safety that's coming over story doin takes it to the 30yard line they think to take entrap because that's what they're doin Logan Rankin Z left guard made a good trap block on that play Corey Dillon now in his tenth year and that's getting the horse for a running back but the great thing now is that they can spell him with Maroney and they had Maroney come they're almost interchangeable in a way milady to pick up the first day here Jason David yeah Dylan is the starter but I think Maroney is quickly becoming the guy mmhmm I think if you know and you talk to defenses you know what they have to do with their run defense and they worry about Laurence Moroney I think that you know Dylan starts and they rotate they do all those things but if baronies not the guy right now he's going to be the guy shortly two per day the season and then he was taken down up from the corner one of the problems that the Colts have with that run defenses they have two smaller ends and Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis and and and they both have good quickness and and they both get up the field now when they get up the field and you begin to tackle there you kind of have a hole inside of it and that's you usually work for people run when they when they're deep get up to feel offensive end to the play the pass is incomplete and there is no flag as look for the harpist indeed you're not going to get a flag it was great coverage kind of Tom Brady he feels comfortable these receivers down vishay caldwell is one of the guys he feels comfortable with he hit him here to catch that ball I don't think that's pass interference I thought that was a pretty good throw that he let get too close to his body he should have caught that receivers missing his two top guys and Westar third band and taken off the shoe tops by kevin faulk but he has stopped at the 19 yard line and they will have to settle for a field goal attempt but you never know a gonna trip well I think when you're playing the Colts and you're playing Peyton Manning and Bill Belichick he has done it before that you have to score point you need touchdowns and when you get in this area on fourth down you go for it now if it were a normal game mother normal team I would say to kick the field goal here I think playing the Patriots you know you have three what this play would be vote for it on fourth you don't see this very often and we lady rolling gang got it for inside the ten first and goal as the seconds tick down to the end of the quarter so on 4th and three Belichick Melanie's going to need a lot of points tonight picks up the first down and that's the way the second quarter will begin first and goal for the New England Patriots 7 to nothing Indianapolis after one Sunday Night Football back after these messages spirited rapid first quarter we start the second quarter al Michael is John Madden Andrew Kramer and Foxborough Indianapolis leading 7 to nothing they've had the ball once in three the respect they show for Mannion so not a bad defense to try to go and convert on a fork employee sorry Dylan taking it to the one and it will be second down and goal Wardy had in the first quarter alone a total of 217 yards of total offense between these two teams my cradle the linebacker they play them less salient angles his way into the enzone so if you were done and they start this drive at their own 32 yards and as did the Colts they go 68 yards on this Drive they converted a third and 20 and a fourth and three you're going to see the rookie Ryan O'Callahan in here now at right tackle Ben Watson get good blocks on that on that right side right there you see they get a good seal they take two guys and they give Dylan that soft corner just asking the who takes the spot vacated when military left for Indianapolis tax are the extra five ticks into the second quarter we're tied at seven in Foxborough get hard at the 18yard line poor emaze who was just activated off the practice squad tonight makes his presence though 20 left in the first half 7/7 big 39yard completion to Gabriel before a oneyear touchdown run by Corey Dillon let's get back out to Foxborough Reggie Wayne the first time here and Andrea what's the update on Harrison well he's got a right arm injury and that Patriots called his return probable but they took him to the locker room he has not yet emerged out there was the injury he was tackling Marvin Harrison came down on the arm so he's back in the locker room and that means Chad Scott who can play or safety he'll take Harrison Scott you got Hobbs and Samuel on the outside there's contain the ball is at the 36 yard here's a down of scrimmage were Junior Seau who had retired earlier this season and then Hinata retirement after about a threeday absence to sign with New England makes the stop yeah this run didn't have a chance you're gonna see Mike Vrabel here he was blitzing on that play and and he got penetration to the side to kind of courtesy see he blows the whole thing up about four yards into the backfield a man whose head as he grows gets it away makes the catch at the 48 yard line so manning under pressure didn't get everything he wanted on it but got enough at Wayne could see the pressure that manning was getting came back to make the catch and that's a 16 yard game I don't say junior say how could believe that he gets rid of that ball like let's say he's right there as he goes to throw it and he's going after his arm and not only doesn't paint many get rid of all three completes a pass Saturday that's what they feel they have to do seven he's tackled air by the outside linebacker Colvin and that's the Colt stretch play where they run the ball to the numbers and then cut it up I always say if you don't get the nose tackle you can't run this time if they don't get the nose tackle but when you're going in a stretch you can run away from what's will go fork goes here he gets to hit Frazier in that backfield and you better to get to the other side a big arm around him and it'll be third down and two you know again that's that's a nose tackle I think you can run the spreads play but as I said Vince Wilfork is a real load in there and and and he takes everything on right in the middle and if you don't get movement on that nose tackle you can't run to the inside that play they didn't get any movement past play at base three four disguising third and three analyst after I've labeled and for breaking me a junior say our tackle for the moment of first and but Ron winter's crew per usual pretty active tonight we get the call illegal contact defense number 30 pillage decline the play results in a first down Chad Scott with the penalty you know that's one of the things that the Patriots of Bill Belichick always believed that they could do against this team is be physical and they want to hit their receivers they want to jam Dallas Clark inside they want to hit Marvin Harrison outside Reggie Wayne outside Campbell by the in those first five yards key to success over the to the oneyard line Wayne got inside position on a santhi Samuel and Manning put it right on the numbers isn't that something way he puts it right I mean watching these two quarterbacks is everything we thought it would be you know it Watchers Reggie Wayne he's outside there and he he has an in from Dallas Park that he runs opposed and as you say Peyton Manning put it right on his mouth where's Damon inside ten minutes and here's a diamond for the and the last time the Patriots allowed touchdowns to an opponent on the opponent's first two drives a year ago against the Colts here 21:18 Manning goes down and then the Brady comes in and Trump's him and then man he comes back and drops him who will see a die here he gets he gets deep but that's good block in there I mean they just they just get on and he just get a push on that cold no one really touches the Boeing is Ravenna Terry they feel these a bit of a traitor leaving for the better contract comes back in the white and blue tanks on the extra point 956 repeating the opening inde with the lead again Tiki Barber sushi 30 yards or brings it out to the 35 yard line 948 remaining in the first half in Foxborough Indianapolis 14 New England's seven each and every year they're the team on top they're the team to beat the office of all machine it's tough to stop those within defense but everytime you could it's always that much sweeter talking about the India fanciest it seemed to be has more offer than that of course in this decade been the New England Patriots refers to a suitable time oh yeah to the 46 yard line and John we go back to Deon branch had become the goto guy but he had a contract dispute eventually winds up traded to Seattle they let David Givens go they've never had a Randy loss or Terrell Owens or a guy like that but all of a sudden here's Brady you can throw anybody out there and he finds them well you know like Bill Belichick was saying the other night someone said different breaks a tackle initially stopped at the line of scrimmage by Jason David turns that into a seven yard game maroney's going to be something special than this league because he has a combination of quickness and moves and vision and and feel and all those things and then 80 yards after that I mean he has the speed and those guys are very very difficult like it's took this time coming up in the secondary that's Bob Sanders no game earlier in the year Brady it just took a while to really get into sync and we were here on that Sunday night when they lost to Denver they're only lost but as you can see through the weeks getting more and more familiar with the receivers getting more on the same page at a great performance on Monday at Minnesota but getting better by the week over the last six games because thirtytwo that comes in at the end of the play he picks up the first and the umpire throws the flag yeah that was that women I mean that's that's something that you know Tony Dungy was saying last night that Bill Belichick always has a wrinkle on offense and a wrinkle on defense you don't know what it is WAM blocking that tight end coming in and blocking the defensive tackle that's the wrinkle for their offense tonight Elega use the hands to the face defense 11:59 kaito June you're gonna see from from from Skycam you see the the WAM is right there but watch that block by Billy Yates the right guard watch him come out right here number 74 get on this guy and he gives Bob Sanders five yards deep that's that's that's the answer the Colts answer just optimal one you know you get the feeling at this point two guys who will not need showers at the end of this game are the punters right because neither defense is going to stop the other offense and you just feel that you know when when the Patriots get well they're just going to go on down and score and then and then when Peyton Manning in the Colts good but they're gonna go on down this floor the Patriot the neighbors will animate the scene tonight second down and six moroni goes to the 20yard line honey as you look at Tony Dungy six years at Tampa now in his fifth year at Indianapolis and of course his pedigree is defense and this is a phenomenal job at Tampa and here at Indianapolis he inherits us and enhances a phenomenal offense and it's it's the defense that they're just trying to get way the defense of wine or the or the great defensive line back he had boozy friends from Tampa first time and a brand new record for Troy Brown who has not caught more passes than any Patriot in history eclipsing the mark held by stainle steamers Stanley Morgan 535 catches for Troy Brown has been a patch since 1993 saluted by Bob Kraft and his family and for Brad you think about all these done through the years running back kicks a receiver and he can also play defensive back right they'll take you to the 7 yard line and you look at the Patriots me here's Brown the veneral Brown he's in there all these receivers you're bringing Gabriel from Oakland you could bring in Cola from San Diego you're bringing the rookie Maroney you have Dylan then you throw a fall into the game it's like it is it's a neverending stream well you know they use they use six core guys and that would be the and he's gonna get wrestled to the turf setting up third and short Rahim brach number 79 with the tackle this is something you get Tony Dungy on one side of defensive coach Bill Belichick on the other side a defensive coach the defense's let him down it seems like every week but they both have the best quarterback in football yeah unless a shootout of sorts he's gonna sneak himself and pick up the first down so Brady's first rush of the night sets up a first down and gold I think that's something that he just calls on his own anytime the quarterback gets up there and he doesn't see anyone in this gap if there's no linebacker standing right there he can just bump the center right there just take the ball and go and pick up the first down pretty contrived there you know he's working with weights and he says one of the things he's really trying to strengthen is his legs I'm not just the quarterback state in for the touchdown 66 yards 11 plays he just does get in we could just cut that he makes here he sees everything on that right side where he can't go and then he just comes back to the left side the plane before the new one Memphis Steve and viscosity will tie the game so Mandan goes down the field Brady says I have an answer for you and we've got a great ballgame for 14 left in the half 14 all Sunday night would fall on NBC that's the Meadowlands it's Sunday night the week from tonight Snoopy's get him at about the 30yard line white runs him down so it gives you a pinnacle they brought him back in preseason this year with a big run back I've got those who's going to be good coverage too because the ball stayed in the air so long did you see it was a wet wipe returned Wilkins the wedge scarf through the right Wilkins guy right in broke through the wedge and then he was right up to sideline you see the wedge right there and then he gets into the wedge when he comes out to the wedge the only thing left there is the kicker and then like right here is six Florence we're only down the short field that is you flag is thrown he threw it into a lot of coverage but when you see Marvin Harrison go down you're normally going to see a flag chance Scott is the guy I think they're gonna flag for this writer when you see Peyton Manning walking like that downpour 10yard line you know that's number 30 penalize at the spot of the foul and a first down you're gonna see I mean see see how quick Marvin Harrison is off that line of wants to be physical with him and can't even function on the phone and then he gets up to that thereby junior sales through sows seventeenth year of course made his mark as a San Diego charger went to Miami announced his retirement and got a call from Rodney Harrison among others here in New England who said get up here and they signed him he's played inside he's played outside there he's taking his shoulder and he's his leverage to take the shoulder second down and goal especially as it who and braving so they hit the heat painting second for the first time tonight you know and that's a Bill Belichick thing when you get down here we have to put the pressure on him when you see jr. sale coming straight up the middle brave will come up from the outside he gets by the guard keeps going outside has the quickness to get back with Peyton Manning saw that 55 coming in this way he just said I've had enough of that place I want to live to play another one he went down time the entire season that he has been sacked once the game and Manning is going to take a timeout prior the third and day at the 17 yard line 14:48 to the half every day your home and contents insurance cost you money most of the time insurance companies just take you money and give you nothing better defensive foul so instead a third and goal from 217 first down after the 12 SEC Asante Samuel is way back there now I don't know if the ball was in the air that should have been pass interference before the ball was thrown that's a fiveyard penalty but that looked like the ball was in the air I thought so too that's what I thought it was going to be interference first down and goal at the 12 yard line and Dungey is probably arguing that right now and because the official did throw the flag and all he has to know was the ball in the air or not when you threw that flag so now they will reconvene all the officials and especially flavors there is no challenge and it can't be reviewed but there's the hole then there's a ball in the air that should have been passed interfering yeah well that's Dungey wanting them to come over under the guise of can I review this if nothing else but to give them grief where's Belichick sees it a completely different way because the Santa Samuel intercepted the ball you know Oh check that there is at the 14yard that should be apparently those lame mates the taxilane is written about at the 6 yard line why us not they Samuel excuse me Albert Bill Belichick still down there yeah I'm he's down there on the under 12 yard line now they're the official finally gave over to him said hey get back he wants to get his word and that that shouldn't have been a penalty that that should have been an interception when a game the past Abby's that they wanted to they could a flag Belichick santÃ© Samuel grabbed dinner was just did he grab twominute warning second and five of the seven when we come back NFL news he gets you ready for week 10 coming up next week right now a week 9 edition of Sunday night football 14 apiece at the twominute warning in the first half out at Foxborough the Peyton Manning and Tom Brady duel continuing here on ESPN let's head back out to our Michael second and three at the file two Chinese the back of the end zone and that is infant Asante Samuel right there hovering on the play he played that one well because that's that's where he do exactly where the ball is going to go because where you want to throw this is to that second pile on the back pile on there Peyton Manning does it Ascenta samuel knows that he's going there and he defends not only Reggie Wayne at that back pylon to the left personal most long time that down a spark in the swamp as the running back sliding and that's incomplete so the secondary does its job Wayne the intended receiver and they're able to keep them out of the end zone he was trying to go to Marvin Harrison underneath and I think the bike brave will got there and did a good job he was trying to go to the right side he was trying to go over here you see Harrison come right in there that's where he was trying to go to see Freight we'll hit him and then he had to take his eyes off him and then then by the time he came back he just had to throw the ball away but Mike Vrabel made that defensive play for the faithful military getting a Johnny demon type 23 yard field goal attempt by the expatriate and a lot of people around here think he is an expatriate in another way 1714 Indianapolis it's kind of like for that overhyping it's sort of like van Gogh and Mikkel Angelo and Abby thought yeah and you hate to be the defense because you're trying to react to those types of things and I know the Colts are in defense they trying get Bob Sanders up there to help with the running and Tom Brady just goes play pass and he has oneonone on the outside and he eats that up and then paint men and they say we want to pressure and we want to rush and we want it you know blitz them up the middle then to do that you have to leave your corners hanging out in those wide receivers so these great quarterbacks he takes it out yardline the other thing Jonathan that's that's great about something like this is so often in sports something gets gets hyped and you can't wait and a lot of times it fizzles but you know then there are things like Hagler horns and there are it's Brady against Manning you wait for it and the first half has lived at all expectation yeah because they're legitimate I mean there's nothing there that you you have to say there's type of geez I hope the way he played that wasn't picked off Benjamin Watson was the initial intended receiver it'll be second down and 10 it looks like the play left over from Charlie Weis doesn't it yes Charlie was there they the patrons probably read more screen passes and anyone in football and then they had faked the screen to one side throw it to the other side all those types of things just like Tom Brady just raelynne on that last play but with this pole defense to be honest they leave that kind of 18 to the 43 New England has all of its timeouts won't meet them yet minute and a half 20 a time and this is when Tom Brady's coolness shows and and we know that the you know that the Colts or no huddle now the Patriots of the first down by Nick Harper and now a timeout will be taken here by the New England Patriots what does Belichick do on a fourth and one from midfield the flecks of Italian football this is a very big gamble he took one before earlier on a fourth and three when they knew he needed a touchdown us into a field goal but if you don't make it here you're gonna get Manning the ball on a 47yard field with a minute to play you play here we himself and it doesn't work comes in and says he's across the line the coaches screaming can you do that you don't even measure what's going on oh that was a big play if they get it first down here because I agreed with you that they probably should have punted here but how about winter coming in on a play where you can't even see where the ball winds up doesn't even bring the change in here it is again he has to look for that official spot at it where he put his foot oh man I don't know because again it's where the ball is the official has to come in and put his foot down right where Brady has the ball here he doesn't have it there it's not close to it yet no I don't see where he picked it up no that yellow line is not official but of course that would be the first down I don't think he has it no and it's not challengeable where in there where in the last two minutes they the guys upstairs may stop the action here we're being told they are yeah it's alright what they're finally announces it because this is inside progress for a first down inside two minutes but take out what the guys upstairs are going to see what you just saw and determine from that those angles where it is both review back in the second winters gonna look at it under the hood the guys upstairs well look at it you have to get to the 48 yard line now I know there are optical illusions and all of that stuff it's very close but where do you put the ball there's the yellow line again that's not official but he has to get to the 48 yard line well you know the last time we saw him in that picture he didn't have it no he doesn't have it now he doesn't have it now he doesn't have it down twisting around I don't know where he picks it up it would have to be after that and at that point his progress had been stopped this is the one angle where it looks as if he might have a chance I just don't see it now the question becomes does winter see enough when he reviews this to say he didn't pick up the first half if he he puts the ball shy of the first and they've already moved the chains among other things I can't believe that I mean I found I found it astonishing that winter came in on a play that close and that critical and signaled first down and you can see after the fact here of course that it was close to nothing at least you had to put the ball down before you move the chains and measure it in the yellow line is right on the 48 yard line and that's the yard line that he had to get to so again you can say that that's like the play and he asked the ball has to break that plane Cato Julian was the man right there to stop him so again if winter rules it's not a first down you're gonna get Manning the ball on the 48 yard line with one timeout and 56 seconds which is an eternity for Peyton yeah that was a tough decision for Bill Belichick again because of the respect to Peyton Manning say we want to go for sound a first down the physically was channel by replay the lingams timeout is restored therefore there is no charge timeout from New England so they restore the time at which is the way you have to do you know may you tell me among other things if winter comes back and he puts the ball down they've already moved the chains so where do you start with the change how do you cannot measure again yeah you don't I mean that's why there was there was nothing that he could look at that would make him change that call so it's including to change being moved already easier to let the place stand no change to measure look at that point first down 48 yard line the oldtimers stephannie traffic rat almost intercepted Benjamin Watson the intended receiver no play here no run back incomplete pass I'll tell you it's an incomplete pass but that was a great throw by Tom radium and it was one of those that 99% of the quarterbacks in the NFL wouldn't throw you know when you have that much confidence that's the definition of open I mean there was a guy behind them a guy on each side of Ben Watson but he still threw it in there to him and got the ball on me Ben Watson should have caught that ball second and ten out of the shotgun we give it to Kevin Faulk he's across the 50 to the 48 yard line and the Patriots will spend a timeout here prior to a third down and six joining us a little bit late also the game right here I'm Brady very efficient and effective eight Manning as well two touchdowns and a field goal Rodney Harrison left the game of the right arm and dream Marvin Harrison four balls including a touchdown pass on the first drive place election 22 Russia's both touchdowns coming on the ground its third down in six now from the 48 yard line after the New England time and I think if I were the Patriots right now I would do like they did against the Minnesota Vikings have Tom Brady get the shotgun spreader mouth you have good spacing with your receivers just hit the open guy one timeout remaining what to say New England has one timeout remaining at the 48yard line third down and six really good sack Brown Dwight Freeney came in and freely couldn't second Dwight who does not have a full sack all season just a half sack last week couldn't get him to the ground and a timeout is taken here an injury with Troy Brown you know and Tom Brady can't run he can do he can do enough to make a play to help his team win I mean I mean watch him here he's trying to throw the ball there he brings it back gets control of it comes up here he's running away from a rush and throws that ball to Troy brown that's your quarterback staying alive but the Patriots do down here is a run crossing pattern it's hard because the Colts play all that cover to with the corners up the safeties often it's hard to get that deep one in the window all the time but you can run the time out of back economy it's intercepted bad sailors and the pass intended for walks and Bob Sanders who was a gametime decision as to whether he'd play or not coming back from his arthroscopic knee surgery with the pic here was 17 seconds remaining in the half yeah we're talking about covered to where the corners are up and the safeties are often and that's a cover to beat or where you plant get your your tight end in the middle and that's what they're doing with Ben Watson back here you see bracket the middle linebacker runs with him he pushes off him a little and here comes Sanders who was a deep safety playing off he comes around there and picks it off I'll tell you who did a a real good job as his Gary Bracken the middle linebacker 58 they're running with Watson all the way like Watson had to push off him a little that he let Bob Sanders get a roll again the ball is intercepted then the player was doubt by contact at the 3 yard line well that won't matter much because they can run out the clock but that's the first time this season that Brady has from two picks in a game like I said I don't think he expected the middle linebacker and that's that that's what in that Tampa to that middle linebacker doesn't sometimes instead of the public you know the country that has the safety there go inland without a timeout so they can't stop the clock and Manning simply with a kneel down but a good first half little ragged finish to the Hat but Manning and Brady both doing their numbers tonight 1714 at the have now time for the Toyota halftime show Bob Costas in New York take it away or wrapping Roberto Foxborough earlier today in Week nine though Dallas and Washington doing battle though it got Monday Night Football we'll get to those and just the volunteer Raiders and Seahawks now they will be doing some battle tomorrow on Monday Night Football you'll see it right here on ESPN Raiders have been short a little life lately maybe they're about to turn their season around Seahawks would like to turn theirs around as well injuries to Hasselbeck and Alexander have derailed them hoping to get those guys back fairly soon the Bears Giants meanwhile one week from tonight on Southern I football here on ESPN Tiki Barber having a great season isn't his last he said so he's still leading the Giants to victory week in and week out they'll be hosting the Bears on Sunday Night Football to the best teams in the NFC going a headtohead one week from tonight to the very best teams in all of football are our featured matchup tonight the Colts seven and all bring their undefeated record in the New England to take on the Patriots Patriots trail by three at the half it's a 1714 Colts lead on the road satire let's go back to first quarter action Tom Brady that's the Pats move in here he's looking to go for it all but Antoine Bethea makes it great leaping catch to the end zone instead of downing and getting on the 20 he decides to bring it out the rookie brought it out to the 32 yard line Peyton Manning and company gonna capitalize on that little playaction for Peyton finds Marvin Harrison 5 yards for the score 7 up and Colts last 15 seconds the first quarter fourth and three Patriots are going fourth they get it to Kevin Barr who gets it to a first and goal crime continued to the second quarter Brady gives it to Corey Dillon oneyard plunge pass tie the game at 7 land paint Manning looking for more with time goes deep to Reggie Wayne down to the oneyard line maybe the two that set up a Joseph Addai 2 yard touchdown run the Colts are back on top 14 to 7 then the Pats moving again first and goal Brady gives to Corey Dillon banging his way across ties the game at 14 then a final two minutes the first half Manning couldn't lead another Drive touchdown that is an invented Harry in the field goal 23 yards in his return and face his former team where he started for so long let's keep comparing those quarterbacks shall we Peyton Manning 9 413 147 yards and a scoring toss Tom Brady pretty sharp 12 for 1730 but two major mistakes two interceptions and both of them were in a red zone area now Peyton Manning's up favorite targets all year long and continuing to beat tonight Harrison and way to combine for eight receptions for a hundred and forty yards and a touchdown and a third quarter under way Foxborough sitting back down Michaels he was trying to force start the second half he's tackled with the 31 we go to Andrea well al I talked to Tony Dungy walking off the field he said that the Patriots are doing more blitzing available than they expected and it was bothering them he said they have to block it better and also get more oneonone matchups on the outside he also said the Patriots know they have to outscore us they're doing uncharacteristic things and Tom Brady is press they sure did they went for it on a fourth and three and that led to a touchdown then they went forth in one and did keyword but at the end of the half that's I've ended in an interception and I think the one that Grady pressed on was marvin harrison will dance out of bounds at the 33 yard line and manning and marvin harrison tonight have combined for five fast reception 832 in their career you know we showed their pregame ritual you know how they come out it you know two hours early and they run through these patterns then the game starts they get good pass protection they just do this thing that they didn't slice about three very simple just like that a 36yard shot the yard may be too close to the 30yard line you watch Peyton Manning and and to me the things that he does are just amazing I mean not only you know his throwing the ball but you know his command of the game plan his what his team is doing what the defenses are doing he's one of the sharpest quarterback what's tonight the twenty yards is going through that goes of the dynastic secondly me that passes incomplete eat coming from his left side Peyton Manning who came into the game with a 100 a serrated this was a thing of beauty right there tomorrow at Harrison Harrison was able to catch the boreholes career touchdown pass actually when I thought and again to the engine a great acrobatic bleep by Ellis Hobbs to save a touchdown and you've got a flag down flag back down at the 18yard line you see Marvin Harris is on that plate old hops good boy hands to the face defense number 15 or maybe he did that was away from the play and it was Mike Vrabel number 50 away from the action with the penalty in an automatic first down if April had a big play in the in the first half when he picked off Marvin Harrison coming across and that's probably what he did on that last place number 54 Abel there that's okay that's legal that's everything he didn't guy that he funked coming across was a guy Joseph Addai to the 23 you think Raven would have been more upset at the end of that play well you know and you know he was he was talking the other day about how you know Peyton Manning prepares and you have to not only match his team physically but you have to match it mentally if you complain about the next play the next my trade if you did it second down to make the taxon loses the bear market sigh to get there we cover before it squirts out of bounds Asante Samuel forced the fumble the ball lying there like a piece of gold ready to be recovered but they couldn't get to it and get possession before it goes out of bounds that's how far off that corner is there and if that corner is off the team they are going to run that comeback all the time there was Park racing in our trail Hawkins we can get there and this possession after Sandra was that last play and these guys run that the corners are 33 say out of blitzes but he gets picked up and the pass is incomplete intended for down historic covered on the play by Chad Scott so the blitz was on Manning got rid of it and at least New England able to limit them to a field goal attempt in the bonus for Bennett Airy as he comes out onto the field and Manning was over there booing Dallas Clark for not running the right pattern but those are the two things that the Patriots trying to do is they want either you know hit the receivers and knocked a rhythm off or knocked the rhythm off fake Manning by getting off his spot which they did on that one military thus far the scene 37yard attempt and that kick is no good so much for what you've done in the past the crowd goes as military missions in the first time they see India still buy food he's gone from strength to strength silencing the critics and earning his stripes the end zone on two occasions two for Corey Dillon wishing that we as they live going into the end zone that would have to be challenged Dylan figuring the play was over Belichick is just waiting to see if he can see something definitive here and the crowd is now viewing the replay as are you now the question is is he down because the officials are late and blowing a flag on a play like that it looks like we're a team Brock as he's tackling them takes the ball away from him on the way down right yeah it's a left hand but it's one of those plays and it's a huge play in the game that Belichick is compelled to challenge New England challenges before number one is it a fumble is he down is Dylan down before the ball comes loose now that's Raheem Brock around him and that's the first thing that can be determined if it is ruled that is a fumble they will also look to see whether Brock was contacted which he clearly is there and so the play would be dead at that spot right and that's what I would say it was I would say the ball comes out before his left knee hit and then Matt light number 72 is on Brock after he gets ball see the balls out there today I mean you can say you know when is it out is it out when it's on the way out or does it have to be all the way out and it's out when it's on the way out and then that light right there number 72 is on top of Raheem Brock so I would say that that the ruling would be that it's see it's a Colts ball right there and not a touchdown and again it would have to be to overturn the ruling on the field was that it was a fumble the play then continued so what winter has to see is enough evidence that it was in the fumble if he doesn't see that then was Brock contacted which is pretty clear I mean Brock was definitely contact your right eye and I don't see any way that he could leave it as a touchdown no so it's going to either you know it's gonna be at that spot and it's either going to be you know the Patriots ball when he says that he was down or it's gonna be the Colts ball right there and that's that's what I think it should be this would be Dylan's first fumble of the season went there taking more than the allotted time here where she could always tell us that he's looking to two things you got a twofer good let's get friends I've got a twofer here I'm working on pair of line of scrimmage would be about the 30yard line is where the ball was recovered it looked like Corey Dillon looks like he thinks he fumbled he had a big fumble in this game and these two teams met about a year ago at the end of the first half after review the ball is findell is then recovered tact at the 31yard line please reset the game clock to 1216 is not charged for the time out and winter is right there you're not charged with the timeout even though you lost the initial reason for the challenge the second part of the challenge also gets factored in so in effect you lose one win one but you're not charged with a timeout but that's three turnovers and now manning has the ball again with a short field at the 31 yard line that was a heck of a play by Raheem Brock defensive linemen are getting so much better at that in this leg of not only tackling the get the ball as they Freeman the fake beer and he couldn't stay inbounds endless Homs with the coverage on the play it doesn't Peyton Manning look like he just came out here tonight to play catch with Marvin Harrison yeah you know the way the Patriots are playing I mean he really has this defense on their heels especially the secondary thirtytwo times they've linked up most in history history second down under pressure gets a second set of the night for New England in off the edge to get the sack when Roosevelt Colvin really came in off the edge I mean he looked like he was shot out of a cannon off the edge watch him he's right down here at this point I mean he comes around far his shoulder and he's right on faith man and fate van Kooten he had no chance to get anything off yard shack third and main before whose words to his yeah so for the first time in the game we will see a point and I think that was the aggressive defense that Bill Belichick has been looking for all night you were you you you get up there you get out of them and you press them and okay we fumble we have their turnover let's go out there defensively and do something don't let them take advantage of that turnover which they did they also had a missed field goal attempt so the Patriots very fortunate that is still a three point game first party game understood so there goes field at the 11 yard line raid in the offense still to work there 11:28 left in the third every day your home and contents insurance cost you money most of the times insurance companies just take your money and give you nothing the winner of this game regardless would be the number to Troy Brown 24 yard line let's go to Andrew well two key defensive players have been are going to update their injuries for the Colts linebacker Gary Brackett has a hamstring injury they took them to the locker room and they're calling his return questionable and as for Rodney Harrison who hurt his right arm in the first quarter he went to the locker room never came out even though they're still calling his return probably Morris enacted and would bracket back in the locker room that is the San Diego State rookie third round draft choice who sees action here yeah and he's an outside linebacker and like you said Gary Brackett gets hurt his backup was Rob Morris and and he's he's not here he's not active so Joe has to come in there and look at his left wrist he has he guess it defense is on there so this is a tough one to have to come in and then be the middle linebacker make the adjustments make the call better have some more Jamie gets taken out of the play at the end and the pass is incomplete you know sometimes you think that the Patriots don't need this you know they don't have to do due reverses and sprays and stuff I mean if they just run right at them they could be successful than just hand the ball to Maroney he'll run you don't have to fake to Maroney fake the end around you'll come back to the screen because that's the one thing that this defense can defend they can defensive it because they're they're small three which today at that point is secure the ball as Cato June tried to get the ball out of Brady's grasp and Thomas stopped short of the first Anna for the first time in the game New England will punt I don't know where they figured out that they needed to trick this defense I think that you know they're they're bigger and stronger and they could they could just run right at it and they're kind of going in a different direction Josh Miller 23 and Lincoln's gets corralled at the 26yard line with nine minutes and 32 seconds remaining in the third quarter of the Indianapolis Colts 17 the New England Patriots 14 you want to see something on Peyton Manning proves you are what you're going to be when your the fake marriage here as an 11 as an 18 year old look at that motion the fate Manning tonight he saved guy had to save motion with the admin he's either doing endorsements it is okay aren't you son you'll see brother Eli next week Sunday night 26 and falling down was the intended receiver a died over the middle he fell down and they'll be second down they recited the middle of this field it was chewed up it was a sand the pit but new sod damage as you can see plenty of divots already tonight yeah this field remember we were here for the Denver game and that was a mess Tom Brady said that's the worst that ever was there was to the Denver and is medicated is better Saturday at 10:00 the night 86 it says picked up those making the cats spinning around Marvin Harrison yeah I mean elegant is the only way to describe him well you know by hot well you know what he does he sees he sees the Blitz or feels the Blitz so he knows when he has a blitz it that he has one on one so when he gets a mantoman he's just going to throw it to Marvin Harrison because he knows that Marvin Harrison will get open all he has to do is look off the free safety and then come right to Marvin Harrison he's going to get the ball for him and then put it in the right spot along a side line or the defender can't get there yeah Ellis Hobbs didn't have a chance on that one for Stinson 45 yardline Manning fresh it's sacked and that's my cradle but the ball comes out then and it's been you take the tight in and that's going to be a reception as he was able to get it away Manning as he's going down and the arms of rebel is able to get it away to the tight end who would have thought that Ben you Tech is gonna catch that it looked like it was going to be one of those things were you know empty hand rule or tuck rule or something he comes and throws it he says everyone's just there the ref you dead gets us a call that pass is incomplete intended for Harrison he's blanketed by Ellis Hobbs setting up a third down and five Marvin Harrison doesn't do an awful lot clock in fact he does very little if any and he was he's been he's been talking quite a bit tonight Dallas HOD flips or something Roy Ellison you know what the heck I was all about repetition after and against the green in Dallas cork takes to catch along the sideline and Clark will be taken out of bounds but not before he gets to the 4 yard line that again think of the crowd is just silent that that will do it here's Dallas Clark he's a he's a slot guy is it tight in but he plays the slot all the time falls down stays alive and again Manning scrambles out to his left and throws that ball only where his guy can get it I mean that is an amazing throw not like I takes it to the 4 yard line and they paid me is he's the whole deal I mean every know a lot about him he's probably at this point maybe the most publicized athlete in the NFL but he he's the real deal you talk to him and they have the chance to do it every time we do one of their games you know the things he answers every question that he's death to diplomatic but he will get to the level of us right but he should be the most popular pull that away as the pressure comes in from Grable now you don't mean to go overboard but there's so many negative stories and negative things on players that when you have something positive and there can be nothing more positive than either one of these quarterbacks so then I have equal respect for both Tom Brady and Peyton the league is built on these guys having Michigan this is a for a football this is what it's all about and these types of games is better a very key defensive stop here for the winter the defense being tested here in the third quarter tested here again and Harrison which they guess he can retain control for the touchdown hain't gonna get a flag for the spike which winds up you know bounding into the face of either one of the Patriots or the official and this is going to be very close it looked like he was juggling it and clearly Belichick it will challenge this if he sees anything where he feels that Harrison doesn't get both feet down can't tell from that angle I would take Marvin Harrison on this play I mean again Peyton Manning puts it were only Marvin Harrison can catch it and only Marvin Harrison can make that catch and keep both feet in it's really close because he doesn't have possession yet there it is left foot graduating number 48 and Bragg's left what penalty well you got it you got a taunting call regardless they will look at it but he got one foot down appeared to drag the other with possession touchdown or not answer when we come back and the extra point is good as the there was no challenge Venna Terry kicks the extra point so Belichick all by the guys upstairs not even worthy of a challenge and it's 24 Forte's he'll be go ahead and hit one week from tonight so far at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough Massachusetts the Patriots trail peyton manning the colts by ten years out the only one back and be taken down at the 39yard line Jason David with the tackle let's go back to the Harrison catch and touchdown well these two guys you talk about being in the same page practicing and that's why you do all that practice and because he knows that all he has to do is throw it away from the defender and then Marvin Harrison is going to make a play on that so he throws it away from the defender to the outside Marvin Harrison Turner's gives his left hand on it that is right hand on it and then she flows feed the nurses its name watch the mix of natural 46 yard line so Indianapolis with the biggest lead of the game ten points was 640 to go in the third you know I think ten points down the the Patriots can still be patient I don't think that they have to force anything I don't think that they have to over react to being down I think they can think it's so run the ball they don't have to give away and they made the salient point before Johnna back in Hawaii trick it up you're going against a run defense in particular that's been a sieve a defense that's vulnerable go back to the basics you run your place you execute you can get them yeah watch Bob Sanders here Alec totally done she was talking about how easy eraser that is on a race replace the linebackers the the front four don't make a play Bob Sanders will come up erase it and make a suit okay contact is made flags to men from every angle ference Marlon Jackson with the coverage on the play and the interference on grace a cold low although draws the flag that was a business defense number 28 on Jackson in the starting lineup there Mike Doss for the season that guy's alive in the crowd up didn't to them and this crowd had gone completely quiet Jackson the safety and Sanders thing and Santa's back new um Indianapolis moving all over the place defensively and the clock runs down and Brady has to take a timeout those are the two things I think the Patriots do best to offensively is is get Tom Brady in a shotgun when you want to throw the ball and spread them out the way they did against Minnesota and then when you're on a run just run were groaning we talk to Tom Brady the other day and one thing he's a real mechanic he's always worried about his mechanics and here left shoulder tight to the body look right down the barrel right bicep here close to the right ear he says you don't want that right bicep out there and then follow through your right hand to your left pocket those are things that he works on all the time those are things that he talks about those reminders he has written down to himself and then those are fundamentals and mechanics you see during the game those content million in every store that's too high before Gabriel where they've kept out of the action tonight he's been limited to one catch early on the 39 yards the former Raider you know when you play against Dwight Freeney and you're a left tackle the thing you have to worry about is his spinning now watch him and that's what he does in you and you practice the spin all the time I was watching the Patriots practice on Friday and they had every defensive lineman an agile offensive lineman working unblocked in the spinner he's painted a every second and that bass is behind and we third down now the the passing game of the Patriots doesn't look as as efficient and proficient as it did the other night it looks more like you know there's still a little out of sync and I thought that you know early in the season they were out of sync and I felt that you know they got in sync but they don't look good like the rules I started out in Sanka English a little bit Malthus put the pressure on that time and it will be fourth down and tandem I think being ten points down I think the Patriots kind of overreact to that I mean there's there's plenty of time I mean it see the third quarter there's you know still five minutes 23 seconds and the third parrot there's still plenty of time plenty of football left to be played you don't have to force anything Stephen just asking the TECO's fourth round draft choice the guy this is going to be Warren has to the seasoned walnuts of his young career obviously and it's good it's big on two counts it makes it a onepossession game at 24 17 and it doesn't give Manning the football at his own 39 with a 10point lead right and they know with with this defense in the way Peyton Manning is playing in the way Marvin Harrison's good you don't want to give him anything good snap good hold good kick inside the right upright with a little bit of a draw he's big in the drawers at Nick Nova kick for Washington today he was just amazing at the end of the game just caught the caught the corner right that old ending of that game was amazing credible you know it just goes to show you from one week to the next I mean ourselves is his gloomy Gus against the Giants that all of a sudden the season gets resurrected last week then you think you got a good chance to win the game today then you lose in that manner this Asti is they're contending New England hazard is also the 37yard line art number 25 created the public the alien comes up with the ball and let's see about the penalty flag at the 37 I bet the penalty flags are probably against the Colts though normally it's against the receiving team you got Hawkins knocking it out very to return and 250 of the return team rocky Wyman our trial Hawkins comes in and just strips the ball out watch Wilkins he doesn't see him he comes in from his right side and his backside he's looking ahead and to his outside and he doesn't feel or see Archer Hawkins Praveena Hawkins not only knocks the ball out but then he recovers the fumble right there they play forced fumble the 46 yard line Corey Dillon he fakes his way yard gain to the 37 yard line you feel like the papers could have done that all the time just run right at him and and and they did that a little early and then they got away from it they tried to do some other things and I think if they just get back to basic fundamental football just go right at this corner animal only one for a first down thirty offences bacon defenses bacon always throwing special teams too but no one really pays that much attention to it but special teams that you know can win games for you and that and that could be the play that turns this thing around for the pay cake you weren't for Hawkins do sports initiations brookey Freddy Keauhou see hopefully with Gary Brackett hurt starting middle linebacker on the shelf at the moment top rate he was having success early with that on on first down when you know when the Colts bring their safety up when they get Bob Sanders have eight men up usually the corners were off second and seven and getting sucked up in the backyard with a flag or we Dylan that was Raheem Brock who came in and knocked them down in the backfield yeah and they were trying to wham him on that one remember we showed that wham blocked earlier decision when Bronco made the tackle but he made it by stripping the ballgame he made the tackle and he was the guy that got way em too and he's a guy that they've been wham in the whole time and again the wham is when it tight in right here comes in and makes a block now Raheem Brock got got a lot of penetration on that he got when he goes down to take on the wham and then then kicks his foot out of the ball carrier that is that is pretty of course dad in ten for the Patriots three minutes to play makes appendage we're taken to my gardener at the 16 yard line you play the Colt defense and most of the times you know on passing downs are going to play that Tampa and they really take away your outside receivers they have to work the middle you have to work the middle to the backs to the tight end like Grady's doing right the more that they issue the whistle had blown Bob Sanders made the tackle he knows dad by the Fosters is something I've been totally dungy said he was an eraser they didn't know if he was going to be able to play they worked him out before the game and had said that he was okay but when he comes he really come I mean if you want to play safety is indeed differencemaker now that that is big few weeks ago tipped away that time it is Antoine Bethea who made an interception in the first half about seven yards into the endzone the rookie from Howard University in a pass intended for David Thomas reasoned David Thomas is in there you see they have him in this slot they're playing with two tight ends two wide receivers and that was just good coverage I mean Brady thought he had him and he would have had him had he medical and after remakes of 49 he doesn't come close on a 36 yarder he looked like he did a flop like yeah he went up there to kick that thing and just flop listen how quiet describe how many how many people is this one hole this is close to 70 70 thousand people how can 70 thousand people be this quiet air came out of it Bob Kraft looking up for the replay along with his son Jonathan and the main something to do with the new sod in the middle of the field that's probably what Bob Kraft is thinkin I don't know about that that's just a bad kick I mean you can't you can't make any excuses for that one you just did a flop after it bags a thief your game Domonique roads tackled by Mike Vrabel as we approach the final minute of the third quarter the Colts trying to stay undefeated Indy would be eight no New England if they win would be seven and one would own the number one seed at the moment by virtue of a win over the folks third quarter just opportunity second down and seven Asante Samuel with the coverage a if she's best as the season comes up to the halfway mark in the undefeated then there's New England they'll either be six and two or seven and one of them you have Denver Baltimore and San Diego cold six since many San Diego put the measure with Slippery other than the pass is incomplete intended for way coverage here by Samuel 22 seconds it'll be second down and 10 I was saying earlier I think one of the most underrated areas of both of these teams and we talk about two quarterbacks and the wide receivers but but these offensive lineman and mr. Colcord because seven shirts his way four to the 43 and that will take us to the fourth quarter end of the third quarter in Foxborough as they work on Malthus the Indianapolis Colts 24 the New England Patriots 17 NBC's Sunday Night Football back after these messages from your local station ESPN brings you additionally airplane corner ready to begin in Foxborough mass L Michaels with and look at the numbers for the 272 57 seven point game it is third down and seven clearly Portugal 40 the first player for Theodore the intended receiver Samuel with the coverage flag at the 48 yard line of the Patriots and the indication is against the Patriots you see who was out there playing defense Troy Brown is that there is yep you know that they'll go as many as seven and eight defensive backs don't leave you use the hands to the face defense number 80 that's who it was that yard penalty and it first down that we know is that there for sure right there's you know on offense I always play him in his flat so when he plays defense they put him on the slide guy figuring it you know one knows one and then he just grabbed him right off the bat he's okay there the coverage really isn't bad that you could jam you can't grout he hooks up with bamboo tech the number to tighten and that will be a first down and that's Howard mud the assistant coach longtime X 49 or years ago Howard gets up and said I can take anything he's a good guy and he's a he's a good like cord I was talking about you know how this offensive line is been their coach for a long time and they had the constant of Peyton Manning his prowess says the number one draft choice the rookie out of LSU and that's a 15yard gain for Joseph Addai yeah Joseph Addai shows two things here one that that he could pick a hole I mean he goes here he bounces variety bounces left and the other thing right here at the end he can finish off the rock that is the way to finish off the run the tacklers are joined backwards pressure and then he is sent coming in from behind Roosevelt Coleman and again Peyton Manning all season long had been sacked just seven times or once a game and tonight that is the third time he's gone down rosey Colvin has really provided a lot of speed from this end I mean here he is right here the outside guy and he has that quickness I mean that was that was just a speed rush right around Dallas market usually when he has his speed was inside shoulder 17 that's intercepted by Chad Stan pays to 25 and finally taken down by that Allah spark of the 45yard line so Chad Scott in the lineup came in after the injury my Rodney Harrison out of the game with a big pick the Patriots got back to their aggressive right back to the interception it's November on animal thunders two interceptions Manning just even in the session that's only a third interception of the season against and the pressure parameter sweetie sweetie talking about the play is this is this he was pleading one of the rare times a season he's been able to come in almost unimpeded and nearly got the sack yeah he did come unimpeded yeah you'd think that they'd know where white Freeney was no one blocked him on that play you see Matt light is going out it's gonna be a screen pass to his side and he should bump him before he goes out he said it's gonna be they fake to the right and they're gonna come back and this is a type of stuff that again I don't think they need against his defense that I think they could just go on they were great disgusting that that is and then ooh with fictional Peter his tango to the 44 yard line it may have been Robert Mathis the defensive end getting a hand on it but the interception by June the assist we believe goes to Mathis and that's the third pick against lady tonight the Colts are doing a lot better a job of that now is is is not only getting pressure on Brady but getting their hands up last week I watched the Colts oh they never got their hands up on their pass rush but they are now and that's what Robert Mathis does you come in you get that inside on that tackle and then you just get your right hand up in that lane that he's trying to throw in front of the first after too much all offense until the wing moments of it and now the defense is beginning your circumcised I was just going to say filled with both things yes so we're here the 46yard no gain they're Patriots tonight making a lot of uncharacteristic mistakes four times they've turned it over missed field goal and seven penalties as well yeah that's what that's what kills good teams too and that's what brings them down to average you look at the Chicago Bears they were 22 so hey Ellis Hobbs as usual with the coverage on the play it's been a pretty good battle I mean yo Marvin Harrison is going to win a big percentage of those battle Ellis Hobbs is giving them a battle because if they want to put they're going to say she's decent do you say and discussion they attack and paint Manning as he loves to do gets up on those toes just moving around on the toes throws over the top hits you tech quiets the crowd on a huge turd doctor version you know what he does he says that he he he moves his eyes and his feet at the same time much I just keeps his eyes downfield he's what have looked at looking and then he has a clock in his hand and he okay I looked I looked I looked enough things that you would think that peyton manning would have had back to back to back 300 yard games at some point in his career as a flag comes in two flags at the end of the play but this is the first time he's thrown for 300 or more in three consecutive games and they hit bun roosevelt cold and coming up here as saying you wonder why is throwing to bend you tech they they use a lot of two tight ends in the year Dallas park and the 59 defense after the play was over fifteen yard penalty first off and we we felt that the defenses were covered on that they were getting more aggressive and doing that but watch cold and come in there and feet right in front of the official I think he's trying to get back at someone I think he saw something happened first and he was the second guy in when he did that to do something like that you probably should do it we've done something deduce the complete whatever Casey has created against doing that's eight penalties for 81 yards you know and this is this is a big drive here I know that you know most of the time you go and you say you know we have to get a touchdown here I think now a field goal would be a big play not that you play for a field goal but I mean the worst thing would be a turnover of course gear touchdown that the next a field goal and took us ten points second down and eight and that the Nintendo for Reggie Wayne and I think that this is a shot here now will you get third long that you you take a shot at the end zone and you do one of those things where either your guy gets it or no one gets it and then you kick the field goal Manning tonight on third down five for stoners the quarterback's is wonderful the phrases go vertical with the ball once he came trotting down the sidelines to take a timeout prior to the third and eighth it's on tap i7 under pressure if the fingertips of Reggie Wayne the heat was put on that time Jarvis green was the first guy to get to them and they'll have to settle for a field goal attempt and that's where I think the Colts had to do it was third down and you just go and you take one shot and then and then you get you feel go was brain here he's he's the right hand he's just taking a heart inside steps out he just worked it against the guard he gets on his outside shoulder 31yard attempted in doing military actions to start of the game Smith picks it down and the kick is good so it becomes a two possession game with 1017 remaining in the fourth quarter set up on the interception operating Bennett arey taxes in for the trade 27:17 to celebrate the launch of the all new innova barbecue some beam is giving you a chance to be a far BQ hero this summer simply SMS your name and the name of your favorite beer to 197th the only ones that kick back yardline and 11 May mating in the fourth quarter Gabriel but his college ball at Central Florida came over in a trade with the Raiders but they've really pretty much taken him out of the game tonight that's only his second catch of the evening yeah I still think that the the Patriots could run the ball and I don't think that they have to abandon the run I mean they're down by 10 but I think the the wrong way thank you for Shannon take it across the 50yard line into Indianapolis territory to the 45 yard line I think they're in a position here with with over nine minutes and needing to scores they still have plenty of time and they don't have to press they could still have balance in their offense they don't have to become onedimensional and against his Colt defense they want to be onedimensional first and ten at the FIFA yard line nine minutes no one is going to get the first down and a 17yard for Moroni whoso signals first down finally tackled by Kato Jun this is the thing that we were talking about you know a wrinkle and watch this blam again it's it's it's the thing that the Patriots have been doing all night you let that that inside tackle go and then you bring the tight end across and you block them it's kind of a rough type thing of fact June and Gardner to make the tackle six will be second down and four this is where offenses kind of earned the title of champion I think quarterbacks earned the right to be called football and Hill when you get in these situations and you can make plays anyone the topper the 22 and the catch is made by Roxon Watson his trail by Malthus and Malthus will go down and needs to come out for at least a play Malthus remember when he was the the past recession listed he made so many big plays as a first down defensive lineman that then they made him a star there he plays every now but you know he could rush or drop there let alone dog and that's what he was doing on that play he just vanished first and ten fifteen intended for is incomplete and a flag is down Fredy Keauhou the rookie line bastards defense number 54 paralyzed at the spot of the and a first down and that was key aho who was signal for the penalty you're gonna see Freddy Keauhou is right here you see him hitting there and again the hit was okay because it was in the first five yards it was a whole to the eight yard line when you when you have Falk in there you don't have to have to run a draw because if you're really gonna run the ball you know Dylan the Maroney of the two runners and then then they put kevin faulk in as he has the pass or the third down guy so he's run the ball his players are draw plays lastly to the corner lesson completed so it'll be third down and goal now from the eight yard line I think this is where you have a problem not having a favorite receiver or a goto guy that you know that maybe you want to spread it around maybe you want to throw it to ten receivers during the game you know and that's fine but I think once you get in this red area with red is the baby passes to baby steps away in the pass is incomplete for 4/4 started to look up field before he looked at in at the three yard line and its fourth down well you needed two scores clearly they would have preferred to get the touchdown and be down by three but at least here field goal will make it a one possession game right you hate to get this close and then not get the touchdown but as you say you need a seven and three so take your three now and then the next time you're gonna have to give yourself for a 26yard and the kick splits the uprights so we're back to a onepossession game 601 left in the fourth nd trying to stay undefeated by 7:00 good run up to the 39 yard line Sunday Night Football being brought to you by the new 2007 lincoln MKZ lights falling where to next lincoln retired by Miller Lite the great aces motivate the light always a good call Warner Brothers new motion picture we are marshal theatres Friday December the 22nd and by Samsung the official HD TV of the NFL that's tremendous silly Sunday night first container your game Joseph Addai Indy tonight just 48 yards on the ground New England a hundred 48 yards on the ground you know knowing Peyton Manning and Tom Moore the offensive coordinator I don't think that they're gonna feel satisfied with whether sevenpoint lead and just run the ball run the ball take some time off the clock and punt it I think I think I think they're going to go for another secondly seven they're also wondering as he goes through his main man mr. Marvin Harrison across the 50 to the 48 yard line in Marvin Harrison tonight has caught 8 passes for 145 yards there when you talk about the great wide receivers of top wide receivers in the NFL where do you put Marvin Harrison if you put him right near the top I think you can put him right on the top I mean he just he just does it all the time and it's not only you know catching deep passes and touchdowns when it's doing plays like that I died turning the corner turning would might have been a small loss into a little bit of a gain gain of about two and staying in bounds as well which is important looking ahead New England has two timeouts as does Indianapolis I think they want to they want to save those I mean if they could they could get out of the field here you know I think you know they could stop the Colts not in field goal range wouldn't be a field big series for Indianapolis that they can get the first down the lowest compelling women who use their time acts on defense second and eight and Anika is a liar and coming back to make the catch so a little bit of a duck may have been deflected man and going down and you tech comes back and it's a 13yard gain and a plot milking first down yeah we were talking about you tech earlier and and you can see the Tedy Bruschi there's on he gives him a little move to the inside then he goes outside Peyton Manning knows that and he gets getting just as he throws it that's why it looked like a duck but that duck did get there big first down huge he's down force between and look over toward Belichick when do you want to use him I was talking about bet you tech and of course he's been in there the whole time because he's the real tight end and then the other tight in Dallas Clark has been a slot all night so they it looks like three wide receivers but the Colts have been playing all night really with two tight ends and after about five seconds of hesitation a little consultation with the guys upstairs Belichick decides to use the first of his two remaining timeouts here so he has one the clock will also stop at the twominute warning but the game is now in Manning's hands if he can keep moving at down and moving the chains they'll take it right down to the end of the game tonight Tom Brady there are his numbers those three interceptions Lora Manning tonight 326 yards two touchdowns Marvin Harrison two TV grabs 99 now from Manning in his career and the Patriots would not only four turnovers but eight penalties for 81 yards you know it's something when you're playing against the Colts well you know that you know the Patriots are down by 10 coz theta 3 get to 7 next time with the coach offensive second down and seven military we'll use its final time out here and I like about it died is he finished his office run I mean he's a he's a he's a tough runner and Peyton Manning is really impressed with him he said he's a good blocker and and he really you know enjoys that part of it and Bates said he used to point he said he used to you know he was worrying about pass protection he would point like this you know for that he'd point that's the guy you blocked you have him and finally had I said hey you don't have to point to me anymore I know I know who to block and baton said because of the teacher every time he would point you would be past protection and and I said everyone knows it's a pass when you do that so you don't have to do that for me anymore have you ever met a guy who really understood the game in all facets in all offenses as much as Peyton Manning while he was playing now I I was with Peyton Manning a year ago out of at an event I talked to him for over an hour and after I was finished art whether my foot about like you know I started to play or faith managed and have to find a here's your ball game from the wigglin they give up the first down Mitaka yes they can so at least they're going to stay in the game though infinitary can now kick what will amount to about a 45 yard field goal it's going to be a twopossession game and the wigglin is going to have no timeouts but this will take us to the twominute warning then they'll bring in venatori and then what New England's going to need are two scores either a three and a seven or a seven and the three with an onside kick somewhere in between how about about they they blocked the field goal oh that's another another possibility that's what they have to do they could block the field goal or baby vegetarian missed another one their fans are thinking right now let us pray twominute warning to celebrate the launch of the all new innova barbecue some Dame is giving you a chance to be a father cute hero this summer simply SMS your name and the name of your favorite beer 197 vessel bourbon banged up a little bit I send you back out to Foxborough where the Colts looking to add to their lead over the Patriots history for one will be a 46yard attempt to make it a twopossession game if he misses the at its own 36 yard line with a little less than two minutes to play no timeouts once for dispense a big thing I think that but the Patriots advocate is much pressure and his field goal block Silvana carry you here there's so many it puts it down and militaries can't ease good would have figured and infinitary having a perfect year would come back to New England and miss two attempts that's why you play this game Bob graphs and EAC I told you we didn't need to sign them you know we have to go get seven points down and that he made that we'd need to scores now we just need one score and that flavor pea Tom Brady all that money that's what this kid has and the catch is made by the watching watson inside the 40 they'll spot the ball at the 39 yard line no timeouts 25 yard game 136 and ticking down that's a telephone it was intercepted by Kato June so again Falk who dropped a pass earlier in a gold agos situation and they had to settle for a field goal can't hold on here Brady is just on his fourth interception of the game and that ties a careerhigh for Brady in that department and Peyton Manning and company can run out the clock and go to the halfway Pole undefeated you know and Kevin Faulk is such a reliable guy and that ball was right there they just went right through his hand gate Oh June was right there waiting for him what does Brady makes a good read has a guy in the middle pull right to his name and without a timeout Manning with a couple of kneel downs can end it and think about these Colts eight and though last week they go to Denver Denver had the number one ranked defense in the league it allowed only two touchdowns all season they come in here against the very tough New England defense they run up 27 points so they're in the middle of a tough stretch and no team in the history of the league have won backtoback games both on the road against teams with at least five wins and no more than one loss but that is exactly what the Colts are gonna do you only saw that that graphic there where the Patriots had five turnovers that again no matter how good you are how bad the other team is there's no way you could win with five turnovers and so the Colts are a to know and now people will begin to think as they did last year can they run the table they're the only undefeated team they go home duty calls to take on the Buffalo Bills next week then at Dallas and then Philadelphia at Indy in three weeks as they hit down the strip right now they have a tubing lead over everybody else in the division wins over New England and Denver a final
