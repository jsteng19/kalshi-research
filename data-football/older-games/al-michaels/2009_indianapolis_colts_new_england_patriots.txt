============================================================

this is like the bus before a heavyweight championship fight it's all of a sudden this is the greatest rivalry time most makes it work though and so it is 24 14 at the half Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth and Andrea Kramer from Indianapolis as you take a look at the numbers put up by the two quarterbacks tonight 237 yards two touchdowns for Brady two TDs for Manning and let's check in with Andrea well of course the big number al for the Patriots is Randy Moss four catches for hundred yards I asked Jim Caldwell about him he said we have to keep the ball in front of us the safeties have to play the ball we have to make sure that Moss just doesn't get behind us now injury wise for the Colts the two running backs as questionable and that's a big blow that means Donald Brown to do all of the work in the back field and he's coming off a shoulder injury and a couple of weeks in that back to kick off and back to receive and gets underway the Colts trying to stay unbeaten the Patriots for the record of 62 back inside the 20yard line and brings it back up to the 28 big play in the first man crush that touchdown pass to boss superstars at work here Tom Brady's gonna buy a little time here watch it blowed up on this throw that travels about 63 yards in the air and Randy Moss we clocked him must be time for the Olympics around here we clock him here and he runs thirty three and a half yards and three point three seconds which translates to about a three six fortyfive status good luck cover in that we lay to 27 yard line he was able to make something out of nothing and knock him out coming into the game Colts number one in fewest points allowed the most points that allowed in any game this season total game was 23 against Miami in that Monday night a week two already 24 and a half tonight's well but you get intimidated when Randy Moss goes over the top of your defense now you have no choice but the back way up and it creates a lot of head second and four that's loss as if he was going to go deep downfield and then turns it out short rap has enough for the first down well the big story this first half has been the play of sebastian Bulmer has he gotten some help yeah absolutely here but a lot of times it's been this and I haven't seen anybody all season long that's done the job that Ballmer is done on Dwight Freeney I think they have a budding star on your hands remember he came to this country didn't even speak English they handed in the playbook and he had to go get his vocabulary book first six eight 3:15 maybe one of the great things about growing up in Germany and not speaking very much very good English is the fact you don't know what it means to have somebody tell you you're gonna protect Tom Brady's blindside surgery yeah you know I mean Matt lights one of the guys on the hall halfcentury team for the Patriots a great player for them for a long time and he is seeing somebody come in and do a job in his stead tonight second return for heaven's sake stop that the Colt 47 yard line 15 yards to the guy's been doing it for 11 seasons yeah we're also seeing a pretty good run block in here as well what's the Bastian boomer here set that edge there you go kevin faulk has some fun in a lot of mileage out of this each side gives had Watson lined up in the backfield as well first down out two minutes into the curry at the 47 yard line nice going you have West Wilker calling a timeout New England mr. French are so Walker's sense the offense of confusion he said let's not fool retired at the outset of the season rugby Harrison wrote our there's Bill O'Brien he's the play caller Nick Tom Brady said if you're going to get me a new play caller get me a guy with a cleft in his chin Plus josh mcdaniels was the offensive coordinator now of course the head coach at dead room season in the yards after the catch showing exactly what he does right there Dean of 14 talked to Wes Welker he calls these screen passes Drive starters here you got three wideouts out there if they don't present a third guy on the outside that time but they late getting there Brady just raises up and hits Welker and that is his game dynamic let's say ow my favorite part about watching this guy play is watching him block second only to Hines Ward in my book San Diego had a man in the center from I am here for a couple of weeks and five the city detective better than it should have he's committed himself but he almost got knocked down at about the goal line Randee lost the passion tendon firm and Bethea with a very big thick boy Tom Brady thought he made a great read here and so did I when I first saw this thing you're gonna see this safety goes this way but but they is going to come back across this way and make the interception I don't think Tom Brady ever saw it he saw the safety on the left jump this thing says I've got reading but they comes all the way across to make the place beautifully done his third interception of the season Joseph Addai has now come back in the game we've seen him since a story to touchdown messed up thingies keep together a person tent for me yardline Gary diketon makes the tackle second six I like to move by the Colts here we have seen throughout the course of this game the Patriots have been playing too deep safeties in the NFL you have to be able to run against that formation so the Colts have come out here in the second half with two tight ends now they're going to try and establish something running the football second trick my car saw a third down and six for the Colts that was a Halley's Comet right there that was one you'd only see about once every 75 years that Peyton Manning throws one right in the dirt wasn't even close what happened to the release of his ball butt one's a Scrooge again the savings I believe you to his left and of course to see let's sign line he goes and makes the catch with Darius buttons the rookie with a coverage 20 yard gain first down where you pick on our rookie we're gonna pick on yours here we're going to put Reggie Wayne and coverage that was a brilliant throwing chair bad throw by Payton was Biden with perfect position and the pickoff and then a flag down and to the play flags after the play at the 25yard line that was a duck I've never seen two balls come out of the hands of Peyton Manning like that and we're talking about two of the last three after the play unsportsmanlike on the intercepting team fifty half the distance to the goal first down and that's why you saw that look on Bellatrix face ten and a half left in the third each guy is gonna pick them in a second man Bob Kraft bought this team in the in the nineties there's his wife Myra son Jonathan and was now they're regarded as a model franchise went to a Super Bowl in the Parcells two three championships appearances in this decade two years ago laughter the intercepts in the passes noted for up to the 25yard line and he picks up a first down on the gain of 13 fraidy checked and then Gary Brackett checked right back and Tom Brady knew what he was doing look at him here he's going to check to cover to fall underneath and Brady knows there's going to be a hole right over the ball because Brackett has to go back and cover that middle zone remember the one earlier in the game that Randy Moss hit him with it right down the middle nobody there we can go no we're on his seventh carry of the night you see Clint session come flying in there on that one that young man has come so far in the last couple of years who says if I'm gonna run all the way the football I'm arriving angry he had 14 tackles in the game he's really developed went from the strong side to the heat side and it fits him perfectly with his speed being a starter last picking those seven out of University of Pittsburgh second down and doubleteam on Sweeney to keep him out of the play at the 31yard line setting up a third down and three boy vulnera scott had on that time he ended up with a little help from his friend watch boma on the outside preen he's going to get him with that spin move that logan bank and saves him at the last minute and 45 left when a third that's my can defense the homeland and Welker has a first down up at the 39yard line coverage on the play by the rookie out of Auburn Gerard powers for West Walker that is five catches tonight for 60 yards you know al it's interesting because now they're helping on Malthus on the other side watch what happens over here now they get the back over there to help him because they're starting to develop some confidence and Vollmer on the other side leaving him single and now trying to help kasher on the right side which recursion we put that way where's Ben Tenn from the 38yard the inside of the 44 year online math has put the heat on brady on that play where we talked about the release point of peyton manning and how you struggled that last drive watch this MV sequence ear of tom brady he's talking about a classic delivery this was on the long ball to Randy Moss look at that release point left shoulder tucked underneath releasing at the highest point of that pass and that ball traveled nearly 65 yards was the thing of beauty people have never talked enough for my satisfaction about Brady's arm strength one of the strongest on blaster case on that place territory at the 45yard line and the Patriots tonight have accumulated 370 yards in this two and a half quarters I tell you what these guys inside Steve and Neil Dan cope and Logan Mankins they're as good as there is in the National Football League Stephen Neal he didn't even play college football the right guard number 61 he was a kind wrestler ended up the world champion and actually beat Brock Lesnar the MMA champion in the championship match of the NCAA rustlings Theismann and hits loss as he escapes the pressure and then Dimas is able to haul it in and that's another gain of 12 yards and a first down for the Patriots anybody says Randy Moss won't go over the middle watch this one I always thought this should count as two catches you know as a former receiver if you catch it once and then let it go and you catch it again a lot of double your stats he is to put on some show tonight as from the 32yard line over 300 yards this is one thing about Grady through his career that's different than a lot of other quarterbacks is when he throws for 300 yards he almost always wins we've run it out years ago as we have an injured Colt that is Melvin bullet who needs the attention and when we come back it'll be second down and one so blow it off the field its first down of 10 so becomes safety spot from the 22 yard line talk about gravy before the break in the history of the NFL when a guy throws for 300 yards they win only about 53% of the time the reason of course is that when you're behind and you're throwing a lot of guys will throw for 300 but when Brady who's now thrown for 300 or more in his last four games when he throws for 300 yards he's 25 in school he doesn't know he's very much period does he work up a dozen 200 ITA's wins tonight 303 with the back in second and seven and inside the 15yard line Lawrence maroney's come in here and run well but the guy that really is made the difference I think tonight is Kevin Faulk Kevin Faulk has had a monster game thus far and he checks back in here in this short yardage situation you expect to play him as a receiver coming out rushing as a matter of fact he has the most yards for any running back that's never had a hundred yard day this might be the day you saw Maroney being asked as well so staredown under Florida play big stop here for the coach Chris Baker mixed up in the offseason free agent from the Jets tackled by Silva and that will set up a first and goal from the eight I've got to start with the pass protection and we've talked about Vollmer all night long but look at it on both sides cash or with a great block as well and he's they're creating throwing lanes now for Tom Brady he's able to step into these throws he's able to see his receivers working down the field I've got five game balls waiting for this offensive line so far who gets tackled by Clint section covering on the play it'll be second down and goal well we sing the praises of Tom Brady in so many different ways but he delivered that football and took a shot right to the chops by Raheem Brock this is when you really start to admire quarterbacks when they stand there get thrilled and still throw with that accurately rady to 315 the boys Quarry crosses the goalline bracket taijuan Hagler is on injured reserve and the guy who's filling his role is Phillip wheeler 50 and he forces the fumble which is recovered by bracket Phillip wheeler really did not play very well in the game last week made a lot of mistakes but me may have just saved the day for the pole simple was beginning to look like going over twice in the quarter that's a dime right there and oddly enough new Indian coming into the game fewest fumbles in the leave that's only their sixth of the season and the third one they've lost now I think it's the first bumble by a running back this year too covered by lead Baden third down and five well we talk about turnovers all the time but in this particular rivalry turnover advantage is absolutely huge regularseason game six at one and those things in Toledo with 29 time and move the sticks pressure everywhere on the outside against these Colts receivers and it has been effective against these guys they are up in their face Dallas Clark has seen it all night after catching one early very effective Thomas Davis Thomas no 96 who makes the tackle Thomas was inactive for a game earlier this year and he couldn't believe it that's why I said before I was wondering if he was in the doghouse or you know the puppy house or whatever what they said is just other guys fit that plan better that's the way the Patriots do it second and 11 just a moment pass caught by Robinson and that's going to set up a another third down with under a minute to play it'll be third and five Leoben so far in this game has been from men 9 times completing just one and has an interception and if pierre garcon and Austin Collie were supposed to be the answer if they tried to take away Reggie Wayne Dallas Clark worked out so well because of action on this set the gadget died Terron Mayo is a young man that is a star in the league already not only does he have the ability to play the run but you're talking about mantoman coverage now clearly a die had a chance for that one but they have never had a linebacker here in the short term that can run and do the complete run sideline the sideline the way the drug act of the averaging 50 yards of kick height seven months along a pastor 40 down to Santa Fe bad kick big run back and that's the way the third quarter ends a scoreless third quarter because of the 14 New England Sunday night football back after these messages in Indianapolis now Michaels purse Collinsworth injury Kramer is look at West Walker who's just one they punt back for 69 yards setting up a first down and goal for New England so they were inside the five before on there resulted in the touchback at the 7yard line first down and goal to the five and we go back to the punt I told you I like Pat Chung watch him working on the outside here on the gunner Anthony Madison think so and it's not three times he goes Fraser there you go four times that's working on specialty that is when the Patriots came to play in the endzone touchdown Moss is turning this one into no moss this is simple this you've seen this one in this game before just go down the endzone and throw one up in the air the Randy Moss good luck try now jump him at six foot five it has been a show by the stars of the Patriots tonight all the way across the board these guys have played great football well boss and brainy begun to take their toll on that indeed defense especially the secondary the Colson allowed only ten passing touchdown tonight Brady three and it's a 17point you bet the Redskins either who came up with a big win 17 comes back in to run the kick back to the 21 yard line there's down catchy away your best player he must consider Dallas Claire because it has been a not by just one safety has been taken away and manning to go back to a point that Tony Dungy made has really stopped looking at him you know I eat his eye thrown to him three times he's just a son that he won't be gotta go back to him and they do here for a first down of the 40 covered by McGowan that's a gain of 19 well they always did listen to Tony Dungy so covered by Baden mouths but not until he picks up a first down so quickly they get to the Petri of 49 yard line we remarkable really when Peyton Manning sees a soft spot in the cartridge he finds it almost every time Oh nicely yards tackled by geitman you know this is what the Colts are going to have to do for the rest of this year you know they had gotten away from this running game and I think that you have to acknowledge that to be the Superbowl champion you have to have a little balance and you can see what it does when they the first quarter and he takes it to the 29 one would you end up with only and just go right at them here goes so who's had a real good half season but a spotty game tonight with a big big catch and a 29 yard touchdown remember earlier in the game I told you leave botton jump that slant I said you will see a double move eventually that one's called a Sluggo slant and go and Peyton Manning put it in the memory bank and came back and cashed it in this gothic knee surgery stomer bangs it through and a big Indianapolis four seconds to go 79 yards and make it a game again 31 21 in a circle Indianapolis or about six blocks from there right victus fielded by Matthews in the back of the end zone back to the touchdown we go Peyton Manning with a great job reading this right here Pat Chung is going to come and coverage right there he sees the single hi on the outside is there that you'll see the pump holds the backside say quarterback playing that time by Peyton Manning really as the Patriots Tarkus John and the play fake welfare tacos quintessential play right there Chris about a 2yard pass and ten yards after the catch to tell you what Tom Brady doesn't miss much either they came on a slot blitz that time Brady saw it all the way and he's just gonna raise up and hit Wes Welker right here not even two years ago to the line of scrimmage from the 30 tool no gain second and ten well you talk to Larry courrier about Gary Brackett and he says this is the guy you're out playing on the playground your first choice no matter what the sport is this is the guy he's the brains of the defense he's he might refer to bracket second down and ten that same play again that just and Welker gets twisted back as he crosses the 35yard line it's going to set up a third and five nice play by Rahim Rock he's sort of the the Joker if you will and at the this is it this is for a first pass and he goes to Moss loss covered by Tim Jennings Oh indeed he was five and wass is able to get it warm winds up picking up eight first out of their own 45 as soon as they flank Kevin walk out and you saw the linebacker walk out there with him Tom Brady knew right now that it was man coverage he took advantage came right to his playmaker naturally broke out of a tackle would be tackle of Jerrod powers so Moss great years in Minnesota two year interlude at Oakland and now the 11th player with at least 900 cashes in NFL history Wes Welker missed a couple of games earlier this year but when those two guys impossible to stop this off second down and releases the bill the ball is alive Malthus creates what for the moment would have been a fumble but New England recovers it anyway as köppen winds up on top of the football at the 45 yard line Robert Mathis has just had a monster game on the outside working against Nick kasher watch the athleticism to jump for the ball got it out before the Robert Mathis with that he go at the speed one time then you come back with the bulrush a 245 pounds going to jam this big 300pound tackle right back into Tom Brady hook his arm and Robert Mathis has just taken over here in the fourth quarter what a series of downs by him Haggar gives up 70 pounds Atlantis Jane rushing this'll be Hanson's six yards total I cook made at the 18yard line by Russian so here comes Manning about the fourth quarter 31 Indianapolis look at that van and remember that game girl was a Monday night the Tampa Bay banning off the fake intercepted by 46 yard line and we'll his back to the 30yard line and Peyton Manning throwing a duck intended for Reggie Wayne and having it picked off Reggie Wayne just did not anticipate whatever Peyton Manning saw I think Peyton thought he was going to get a safety blitz and that Reggie Wayne was going to take his guy deep when he broke it off inside he had no idea where that ball ended up right out here is where it's going to happen but you could see that Peyton was checking he saw the safety come down in the slot thought he was just going to get a single man coverage on the outside threw it up and Reggie Wayne didn't see the same thing we don't see those two guys get confused too often uhhuh and in to pitch to start to think about taking some time off the clock seven and a half to go in regulation now the significance of holding the Patriots to just a field goal here you can keep it a to score game at that point still obviously plenty of time when you have quarterbacks like this on the field and see how aggressive the Patriots are going to be here secondly my I'm taking the play clock down to five that class is caught by Isiah and back he's tackled three yards shy of the first down with less than seven minutes to play well they end up rotating over the top here to mosses sides they just come back to the single receiver side noisiest and back has definitely contributed in this ballgame tonight they've used him to chip on some of these pass rushers but he's also caught the ball well one who was able to pick up the first down to the 20yard line what they hoped would be events Vantage in the playoffs there's at the 20 yard game Bill Belichick said it very simply last night the significance of this game he told his team hey look if we don't win we have no chance to catch them if we win we're right on their flank well it is fill in the blank yeah it is a you know this game is always a swing game isn't it I mean when they get together and all the championships that have been won between these two teams usually somewhere along the way one team has to beat the other to get there to that championship game second down and six and this is you know when you look at this Chris homefield advantage we can make too much of it but I think it would be tougher for Indianapolis the way they're constructed to go outdoors in January New England and play maybe in the snow or whatever it's gonna be is supposed to New England coming here and no question I think the major the goats don't run the football very well you know perfect conditions is what they really need to compete against some of these upperlevel teams third and eight this is a big conversion in terms of so it's for that and they do limit them to a field goal attempt with 417 to play in Indianapolis looking ahead with all of their timeouts the twominute warning well it's just been a sloppy game tonight for this Colts offense we've seen Peyton miss some throws we've seen miscommunication you're seeing drop passes and you can't play a team of this caliber like that and win the football game there's still time there's still a chance for them to come back but they've just made too many mistakes to this point mr. Smith packed on three more and make it a 13point lead thirtyfour 21 in jeopardy tonight because they're down by 13 to be skipped we'll bring it back to the 21 yard left in the fourth quarter 13point p38 leads there's your quarterback comparison right now in a 13point game England on top again Indianapolis with all of its timeouts and the coup in his hand our line tackle there by Jerrod Mayo those little short passes over the middle Austin Collie tackled by Darius Butler as we took down the three and a half minutes to play and readjust and getting at the 45yard line one of the reasons it was underthrown as thomas planting manning as he throws where Austin Collie with a nice route that time and he's going to get the flag you've got Darius but near the keyonna Connecticut who was there made contact and draws the flag a great play by Austin Collie right there that's a veteran football play the ball a little under two irons defense number 28 balls a little under thrown so colleague jumps back into the defender here Darius Butler and is going to get the call by jumping back into him that's what drew the call it wasn't the butler did all that much but it was collie who made that black and that penalty is worth thirty nine yards in less than a minute I had to close and move the boy from the curtain yardline second and one Butler makes the tackle ma shakin his head 243 to go they're gonna single up on Dallas Clark stay with him he is big enough to beat these corners just with body positioning on second and the coverage that time is good by Wilhite on Wayne stopping the clock at 227 and it will be third down and one but despite the incompletion Peyton keeps them at the line of scrimmage to keep the Patriots from substitute the scene touchdown Colts laughing just to use a single timeout so there's still 223 on the clock and they can stop the clock three times plus the twominute warning the dyes second touchdown of the night one rushing one receiving and Matt Stover makes it a six point game spread them out all over the field and then big Vince Wilfork right here in the middle just enough trust me it takes two guys to make this block lost he couldn't see over the top for the doubleteam and just couldn't find a dye to make the play but what a drive by the Colts she'll block right back in see the streak in I don't think you're on sidekick it's one of the options but with three clock stoppages and the twominute warning I think he's just kind of you have to think your defense or at least put it in their hands as opposed to an on side cook that's what I was doing I agree with that because remember a field goal here would end up putting it at nine points you're out of the game and then you're out of the game so you're better off letting your defense play that's a defense that's going to have to stop an offense that has Dean's 459 yards tonight if you can prop it in deep and not like that you don't want that in hands yeah Welker up there standing on about the 25 you dropped that in the corner come up inside the tan baby if you can for sure one day Russia won't go in 200 for a special series this is the time and again he has to take the time out well that's a very uncharacteristic time out and that's their second they used one earlier and you know you wonder if that's something that comes back and burns you later because of Indy gets the ball and they get a touchdown now you're down to only one time on it that's weird I mean to start a drive with a timeout between these two teams I mean every time you see them take the field and 34 the offensive touchdowns sprinting up and down the field it's just one of the great series that as we said at the beginning most of these games have lived up to the height the less Jason's coming from only time of course seven six point eight false we'll take a timeout second down and ten and that's the smart thing to do you take your time outs on defense you take them on this side of the 200 first of the two guys man gets his ball back second and ten any moss and you'll find me outside welcome comes to the right side in this slot you got swatted 27 yard line and now a timeout again taken by Indianapolis with a gigantic third and two coming up well that time when Wes Welker went in motion across the formation Tom Brady saw he all he needed to see nobody walked out there with him you've got Clint session basically trying to cover one of the best slot receivers in the game forget that one of the best the best long receiver in the game and Brady goes right to this combination of Randy Moss and Wes Welker back to lost with the most much downs during the course of the time that he's been in New England and West welcomed with the most catches in the league during so here is a huge play and cue when Jarvis green Ellison lady comes up in the shotgun horsedick the Pope's gold blitz about this kid drive almost had the gamewinner away with this thing and he might have scored powers at least lining up as if they're gonna go for it I can't believe that though they're gonna take a timeout they're gonna take a timeout New England is before a fourth down and two two powers with the coverage pressure was put on that time to force Brady's pass with 208 and almost an interception bill belichick with nothing else time sunshine the catch is made so instead of getting reacts they're going to measure it anyway but they're going to be sure now this happens on the front side of the two warning so if Belichick wants to challenge this he can not to the booth review yet but his purse said the key thing here when do you have possession of it Hitler and that's where Scott green marks it doesn't have it doesn't have it has it and he goes down this is the two in a twominute warning but again Belichick fantastic we're back Belichick cannot challenge that remember he took two timeouts on this drive one before they started the first outweigh the other one they determine what they're going to do on fourth down so there's no challenge it's juggled it's juggled it's spotted it would have been extremely close there's no way they can challenge it and since it happened on the front side of twominute warning is no food for you at 14 wagon huddle up here any time for time that's exactly what they're doing yep going back in the huddle here this clock to run this is all or nothing obviously at this point if they needed Indianapolis has long time out of timeouts you can do a few things to talk about back to the touchdown play the doubleteam powerful guys in the league when we talked about the lack of depth these guys are wearing down now for a New England second and goal under enhancement it both still have that one timeout you need to pick it up please 29 yards and now to give the Colts the lead Stover situation Belichick a great coach but through the years so many times their clock management is very good so many right decisions and this was just stunning Level II to go for it on fourth down as the place is replayed right here but to waste I'm out on the front side and leave yourself the month fourth down and then kind of puts a fade speaking of co2 that's Kody Glenn to plant some of nine seconds postgame shows coming up on here with Tony's got to say about this to tell the story of this one bill belichick didn't trust them in that situation is unprecedent dances quick is against balance as mine the coach in New Orleans the only lady by 13 childish Connecticut two touchdowns who's up the other side of the break
