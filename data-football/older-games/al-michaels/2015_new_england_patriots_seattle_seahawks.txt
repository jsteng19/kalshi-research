============================================================

&gt;&gt; ARIZONA IS THE GRAND CANYON STATE. BEAUTIFUL LOOK AT GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK. COUPLE OF HOURS' DRIVE NORTH OF THE GREATER PHOENIX AREA. JUST A SPECTACULAR SUNDAY AFTERNOON. AND NOW A LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX STADIUM, WHICH OPENED IN 2006 AND IS THE HOME OF THE ARIZONA CARDINALS. BILL BELICHICK WEARING HIS FAVORITE HOODIE. THAT NO. 2 PENCIL WILL GO INTO HIS EAR SHORTLY. STEVEN HAUSCHKA WILL BE KICKING OFF FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. AND NEW ENGLAND WILL START ON OFFENSE, AS BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK IS DANNY AMENDOLA. THE GAME IS A TOSSUP. BOTH TEAMS ARE TERRIFIC. PETE CARROLL ALWAYS ENJOYING THE MOMENT. MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHAT KIND OF A DAY WILL HE HAVE? BUT HE'S GONNA START WITH SKITTLES. SO NOTHING ELSE IS NEW. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; MIGHT AS WELL JUST BE A PRESEASON GAME IN AUGUST FOR HIM. RICHARD SHERMAN READY TO GO TO WORK. INJURED HIS ELBOW. EARL THOMAS, THE DISLOCATED SHOULDER, BUT BOTH WILL PLAY TODAY, AS HAUSCHKA GETS READY TO KICK OFF. SUPER BOWL XLIX UNDER WAY IN GLENDALE, ARIZONA. WE'LL START WITH A RUNBACK BY AMENDOLA FROM 5 YARDS DEEP. AND TO THE 18YARD LINE HE COMES, AND THAT'S WHERE NEW ENGLAND WILL SET UP SHOP. TOM BRADY. HE SAID TO US YESTERDAY, AFTER WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, HE SAID, "THERE WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE." &gt;&gt; NO SHORTAGE OF RED MEAT IN FRONT OF TOM BRADY FOR THIS ONE, IS THERE? &gt;&gt; HE HAS SHANE VEREEN AS HIS RUNNING BACK. MEANWHILE, NOW YOU'VE GOT GRONKOWSKI FLANKED WAY OUT TO THE RIGHT, NEAR THE SIDELINE. SHERMAN ON HIM. BRADY STARTS FROM THE SHOTGUN. THAT'S EDELMAN IN SHORT MOTION. AND THE FIRST PLAY IS A PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. IT'S CAUGHT NEAR THE SIDELINE, BUT ONLY A MINIMAL GAIN NOW FOR GRONKOWSKI. BRUCE IRVIN MAKING THE TACKLE. SECOND AND LONG. BRADY, SIXTH SUPER BOWL START. HE'S THROWN 197 PASSES IN THOSE GAMES. 1,277 THROUGH THE AIR. ALL SUPER BOWL RECORDS. THREE WINS, TWO LOSSES. AND ONE OF THOSE LOSSES CAME HERE AFTER THE '07 SEASON, TO SPOIL THE PERFECT SEASON, AS THE NEW YORK GIANTS DID THEM IN. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT IS NOW IN THE BACKFIELD. SECOND DOWN AND 8. THIS IS AMENDOLA COMING IN MOTION. SHORT DROP. PASS CAUGHT ON THE OUTSIDE. BREAKING A TACKLE AND COMING UP ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN IS AMENDOLA, AS HE GETS AWAY FROM RICHARD SHERMAN. AND THAT WILL SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND 2 FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; WELL, CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS, HOW CAN YOU HANDLE THESE PASS RUSHERS? THAT'S ONE WAY. GET THEM ON THE GROUND WITH SOME QUICK THROWS. AND THEN IT'S RICHARD SHERMAN ON THE OUTSIDE. WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT ELBOW. WILL HE BE ABLE TO TACKLE? WILL HE BE ABLE TO JAM THE RECEIVERS THE WAY THAT HE TYPICALLY CAN? &gt;&gt; IN THAT GREEN BAY GAME, IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PLAYING WITH AN INVISIBLE SLING. THIRD AND 2. BRADY. GOOD, CLEAN POCKET THROWS. AND THAT'LL BE THE GAME'S FIRST FIRST DOWN, AS VEREEN SHANE VEREEN MAKES THE CATCH, AND HE'S TACKLED THERE BY THE OUTSIDE LINEBACKER, K.J. WRIGHT. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST THE PATRIOTS IF YOU CLEAR ZONES, YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THE LIKES OF JULIAN EDELMAN AND SHANE VEREEN WITH INSIDE LINEBACKERS. THEIR QUICKNESS VERY TOUGH TO DEAL WITH. &gt;&gt; NEW ENGLAND CAN BEAT YOU EITHER WAY. IN THE DIVISIONAL GAME AGAINST BALTIMORE, 53 PASSES, AND THEN 40 RUNS AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. THIS IS BLOUNT. THE SEAHAWKS EXPECT THEM TO BE MORE BALANCED THE PATRIOTS TODAY. SO HERE IS BLOUNT. HE WAS A PATRIOT LAST YEAR. HE SCORED FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN A PLAYOFF GAME AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. THEN HE SIGNS WITH PITTSBURGH. DOESN'T LIKE HIS ROLE THERE BECAUSE Le'VEON BELL WAS CLEARLY THE NUMBERONE BACK. WALKS OFF THE FIELD BEFORE THE END OF A GAME IN NOVEMBER, AND THEN WINDS UP SIGNING, AFTER HE CLEARED WAIVERS, WITH NEW ENGLAND. SO HE RETURNS HOME, AND HE IS THEIR STUD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE JONAS GRAY, THEIR OTHER RUNNING BACK, IS INACTIVE TONIGHT. SECOND DOWN AND 8. AND HERE'S BLOUNT. AND BLOUNT GETS IT UP TO THE 35YARD LINE. WRIGHT MAKES THE DEFENSE. THE SEATTLE DEFENSE BECOMING LEGENDARY RIGHT NOW. THEIR RANKS THIS YEAR FEWEST POINTS ALLOWED, FEWEST YARDS ALLOWED, THIRD AGAINST THE RUSH, TOPS AGAINST THE PASS. AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST THREE SEASONS. THIRD AND 6. DAN QUINN, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WHO IN THE NEXT 36 HOURS OR SO WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS THE HEAD COACH OF THE ATLANTA FALCONS. BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST FOR HIM HERE, AS NEW ENGLAND COMES UP SPREAD OUT. FIVE RECEIVERS. PLAY CLOCK IS DOWN TO :02. THIRD AND 6. BRADY ABLE TO SURVEY. THROWS LOW AND INCOMPLETE. SO THEY GOT ONE FIRST DOWN, AND NOW THEY'LL HAVE TO PUNT. BYRON MAXWELL COVERING VEREEN. AND SEATTLE WILL GET THE BALL. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE PATRIOTS IN THIS GAME IS TO FORCE THESE DEFENSIVE ENDS TO RUN THE LOOP. GO ALL THE WAY AROUND TOM BRADY AND THEN TRY AND SECURE IT UP FRONT TO MAKE SURE THAT TOM BRADY CAN STEP UP. THAT TIME, A LITTLE ANTSY IN THE POCKET. GOT RID OF IT QUICKLY. MISSED THE THROW. &gt;&gt; RYAN ALLEN. THE LEFTFOOTED PUNTER. GOOD, HIGH, DEEP PUNT. FLAG IS DOWN AS IT'S TAKEN AT THE 15YARD LINE. JERON JOHNSON CAME IN AND MAY HAVE RUN INTO THE KICKER. IF HE RAN INTO THE KICKER, IF IT'S THE 5YARD VARIETY, IT'S STILL NOT GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN. BILL VINOVICH WILL MAKE THE CALL. IF THAT'S A 5YARD PENALTY, IT WOULD BE FOURTH DOWN AND 1. ROUGHING THE KICKER IS A FIRST DOWN. BIG CALL HERE. &gt;&gt; I THINK HE GOT HIS PLANT FOOT. &gt;&gt; RUNNING INTO THE KICKER. KICKING TEAM, NUMBER 23. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S THE GARDEN VARIETY, AS IT WERE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE WILL NOW BE THE 40YARD LINE. AND ANOTHER LOOK HERE. &gt;&gt; THE RULE IS, IF YOU HIT THE PLANT LEG THIS LEG THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 15 YARDS. I DON'T SEE RUNNING INTO THE KICKER RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN. TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; WELL, JERON JOHNSON, HE CAN SMILE RIGHT NOW, BUT HE GOT AWAY WITH ONE. HAD IT BEEN ROUGHING THE KICKER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 15YARD PENALTY AND A FIRST DOWN. HERE IT IS AGAIN, CRIS. &gt;&gt; SO THE NONKICKING LEG WHEN YOU HIT THAT LEG, THAT'S 15 YARDS AND AN AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. WITHOUT QUESTION. BILL VINOVICH'S CALL, AND HE MISSED IT. &gt;&gt; SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOURTH AND 1. NEW ENGLAND DECLINES THE PENALTY. THEY'LL TAKE THE PLAY. THAT WAS A 49YARD PUNT. THE BALL IS AT THE 16YARD LINE. AND LYNCH CARRIES. "BEAST MODE" UP TO THE 20YARD LINE BEFORE HE'S TACKLED BY HALF OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. RUSSELL WILSON. WHEN HE FACES SUPER BOWLWINNING QUARTERBACKS HIS CAREER NOW THREE YEARS OLD HE'S 100, INCLUDING A WIN AGAINST TOM BRADY WHEN THESE TWO TEAMS LAST MET IN SEATTLE, EARLY IN THE SEASON IN 2012. SEATTLE WON THE GAME, COMING FROM BEHIND, AND WILSON SAID, "THAT REALLY GOT US GOING." HE HAD A GOOD YEAR IN '12. OF COURSE THEY WON THE SUPER BOWL LAST YEAR, AND THIS YEAR NFC CHAMPS AGAIN. SECOND AND 7. STACK THREE RECEIVERS TO THE LEFT. WILSON HAD TO REACH DOWN FOR THE SNAP. AND THAT'S MARSHAWN LYNCH PICKING UP A COUPLE. ABOUT 2 YARDS SHY OF THE FIRST. THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS SOMETIMES WHEN MAX UNGER, THE CENTER, IS MOVING TO HIS LEFT, THE SNAPS GO TO THE RIGHT. THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH THAT IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME, AND HERE WE GO WITH THE EARLY SNAP WITH THE SAME ISSUE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OF PARTICULAR IMPORT THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN THE READ OPTION. CAN THROW ALL THE TIMING OFF. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2. THEY GO FOUR WIDE HERE. AND LYNCH IS GOING TO GET STACKED UP AND STOPPED. SO AFTER SEATTLE GETS THAT BREAK AND GETS THE BALL AFTER WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGHING, IT'S A THREEANDOUT AND THEY'LL GET THE BALL BACK. &gt;&gt; BIG VINCE WILFORK RIGHT HERE. YOU NEED YOUR SUPERSTARS TO PLAY HUGE IN THE SUPER BOWL. THERE YOU GO. HE STANDS HIM UP. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S BENCHPRESSING JUSTIN BRITT OFF OF HIM. HE MAKES CONTACT THOSE HUGE ARMS, HE EXTENDS THEM OUT, GAINS CONTROL, AND MAKES A BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; JON RYAN TO PUNT. IT WAS RYAN WHO WAS HOLDING ON A FAKE FIELD GOAL THAT TURNED INTO A TOUCHDOWN WHEN THEY WERE DOWN 160 TO GREEN BAY. THAT WAS A HUMONGOUS PLAY IN THAT GAME. NOSE DOWN WITH A LOT OF BACKSPIN. FAIRLY SHORT KICK. FAIR CATCH CALLED FOR AND MADE BY EDELMAN. BILL BELICHICK, NO. 2 PENCIL AT THE READY. AT LEAST HE'S NOT WEARING THE FLIPFLOPS THAT HE WORE ALL WEEK LONG. HE'S GOT HIS SNEAKERS ON TODAY. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] FORMAL WEAR. &gt;&gt; QUITE A SCENE AT MEDIA DAY. BRADY TO WORK. STARTS FROM THE GUN. FROM THE 32. PRESSURE PUT ON. VEREEN, WITH SOME HELP OUT IN FRONT. TAKES IT OUT TO THE 35YARD LINE. THAT'S A SHORT GAIN. KEEP AN EYE, CRIS, OBVIOUSLY ON KAM CHANCELLOR, WHO GOT BANGED UP IN PRACTICE THE OTHER DAY. HURT HIS KNEE AND WEARING A BRACE. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT A SPEED PLAYER ANYWAY. HE'S ESSENTIALLY, AS BILL BELICHICK CALLS HIM, A LINEBACKER, HE'S SO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. BUT HE IS THE HAMMER ON THE BACK END, THE GUY THAT DELIVERS THOSE BIG HITS. AND YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER NOW, IF HE DOES GET IN MANCOVERAGE SITUATIONS, WILL HE BE THE SAME? &gt;&gt; CHANCELLOR PLAYS DOWN LOW. EARL THOMAS PLAYS DEEP. THEY'VE GOT DEVELIN IN AT FULLBACK. THE FAKE TO BLOUNT, AND BRADY FLIPS IT TO THE SIDE FOR A FIRST DOWN. JULIAN EDELMAN TAKEN OUT THERE BY BYRON MAXWELL. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF GAME THAT THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS AND TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY HERE. YOU HAVE TO GET THE BALL OUT OF YOUR HANDS QUICKLY WHENEVER YOU PLAY AGAINST SEATTLE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SEATTLE IN PRACTICE THIS WEEK, AT 2.3 SECONDS, THE COACHES BLEW THE WHISTLE. THEY SAID, "YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME THAN THAT TO GET TO TOM BRADY." &gt;&gt; 8:12 LEFT IN THE OPENING QUARTER. PATRIOTS LINE UP CAMERON FLEMING AT TACKLE AS ELIGIBLE. THEY DID THAT 28 TIMES IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. AND A NICE LITTLE HOLE HERE EXPLOITED BY BLOUNT, TAKING IT ACROSS THE 50 TO THE 49YARD LINE. AND THAT WILL MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 5 FOR THE PATS. &gt;&gt; RYAN WENDELL, ONE OF THEIR BEST RUN BLOCKERS, IS GONNA LEAD THE WAY ON THE POWER PLAY HERE. AND THIS IS WHAT THE PATRIOTS ARE HOPING TO DO. THE BUZZ WORD FOR THEM THIS WEEK WAS "CONTROL." "WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE GAME." THEY'RE HOPING FOR 30, 35 RUNS IN THIS GAME WITH LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. &gt;&gt; AND BLOUNT IN AGAIN. NOW YOU'VE GOT DEVELIN AS THE FULLBACK. HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. BLOUNT SAYS SOMETHING TO DEVELIN AT THE END, AS THE SNAP FROM BRADY TO BLOUNT. AND HE GETS GANGTACKLED AS HE REACHES THE 48YARD LINE. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. TONY McDANIEL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE FOR THE TACKLE. JOSH McDANIELS IS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE HAD BEEN IN NEW ENGLAND. REMEMBER, WENT TO DENVER, THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. WENT TO ST. LOUIS FOR A LITTLE WHILE. NOW BACK AS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. WE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE MUCH IN DEMAND WITH THE COACHING VACANCIES, AND HE WAS, BUT HE HAS CHOSEN TO STAY IN NEW ENGLAND, AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIRD AND 3. BRADY, A QUICK TOSS. INSIDE SLANT. CAN GRONKOWSKI GET THE FIRST DOWN? HE CAN. CHANCELLOR IS THERE TO MAKE THE TACKLE. NEEDED 3, GOT 4. FIRST DOWN, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; JULIAN EDELMAN ON THE INSIDE, JUST GONNA RUN OUT HERE. AND THERE IS A COLLISION AND A FIRST DOWN. TOM BRADY NEVER EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO FIND THE LACES ON THAT ONE. HE DIDN'T CARE. HE FOUND THE BIG GUY, NUMBER 87. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNEW WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CHALLENGE NATE SOLDER WITH THAT SPIN MOVE INSIDE. TWO YEARS AGO, 2012, THEY PLAYED, CHRIS CLEMONS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST NATE SOLDER WITH THAT MOVE. &gt;&gt; EDELMAN IN MOTION TO THE OUTSIDE. BRADY IDENTIFYING THE "MIKE," OR MIDDLE LINEBACKER. BRADY FLIPS IT AGAIN TO THE OUTSIDE. VEREEN. SHANE VEREEN TO THE 40. BOY, IT'S BEEN A MERRYGOROUND AT RUNNING BACK FOR THE PATRIOTS THIS YEAR. THEY STARTED WITH STEVAN RIDLEY. HE GOT HURT. THEN VEREEN. THEN JONAS GRAY CAME ON AND WAS SPECTACULAR FOR A WHILE. MISSED A MEETING, AND THEN THEY BENCHED HIM AND PUT IN BLOUNT. &gt;&gt; THERE GOES VEREEN OUT. BUT WATCH AFTER HE CATCHES THIS BALL, HOW EVERYBODY COMES DOWN THREE GUYS RIGHT THERE TO MAKE THE TACKLE. ONE OF THE BIG POINTS OF EMPHASIS IN THIS GAME IS NO YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. IF THEY CAN TACKLE LIKE THAT ALL DAY, THEY'LL BE FINE HERE. &gt;&gt; GRONKOWSKI SETS UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR LEVERAGE. AND BLOUNT FIGHTING HIS WAY, TRYING TO PICK UP THOSE EXTRA 2 YARDS TO GET THE FIRST. HE'S ABOUT A HALF YARD SHY, AS HE TAKES IT INSIDE THE 35YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD AND 1. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE QUESTION IN THIS GAME WHICH OF THESE BIG BACKS COULD CONTROL THE GAME? MARSHAWN LYNCH, LeGARRETTE BLOUNT? THE PATRIOTS SAY, "WE'RE A LONGDRIVE TEAM. WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO STRING THESE TOGETHER LIKE THIS." AND SO FAR IN THIS ONE, THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; OFTTIMES BRADY LIKES TO SNEAK, BUT NORMALLY IT'S WHEN THEY GET TO THE LINE EARLIER THAN THIS. THIRD AND 1. HANDS IT TO BLOUNT. SWINGS TO THE OUTSIDE. TURNS THE CORNER. PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT TAKES IT TO THE 25YARD LINE. EARL THOMAS WITH THAT DISLOCATED SHOULDER HE TOLD US HE COULDN'T HAVE PLAYED IF THIS GAME HAD BEEN LAST WEEK MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; BOUNCE OUT ALL THE WAY. THEY'RE GOING TO COME WITH THE FULLBACK, DEVELIN, HERE, WHO'S GONNA GET THAT OUTSIDE EDGE. IT LOOKED LIKE AN INSIDE RUN, BUT THE WHOLE WAY THAT WAS INTENDED TO GO OUT ON THE EDGE. AND THERE WAS BYRON MAXWELL, JUMPED INSIDE, AND PICKED UP A BIG FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; PATRIOTS, FOUR FIRST DOWNS IN THE GAME. SEATTLE, NONE. THEY HAD A THREEANDOUT. SIMPLE PLAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE. NOT MUCH THERE. TAKING IT TO THE 24YARD LINE THROUGH THE MIDDLE IS BLOUNT. IN POSTSEASON PLAY, THE SEATTLE DEFENSE, WHICH IS SPECTACULAR, BUT IN THE REGULAR SEASON, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIRD IN THE LEAGUE, BUT IN THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES, AND THOSE WOULD BE THE GAMES AGAINST CAROLINA AND AGAINST GREEN BAY, AND EDDIE LACY HAD A BIG FIRST THREE QUARTERS 133 1/2. SECOND DOWN AND 8. FROM THE 24. THE FAKE TO BLOUNT. THE PASS TO AMENDOLA. AND HE HAS A FIRST DOWN. DANNY AMENDOLA MAKES HIS SECOND CATCH. &gt;&gt; SO FAR THEY'RE COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZING THE RUSH OF SEATTLE. HERE WE GO. JUST RIGHT OUT IN THE FLAT. LOOKED LIKE BRADY GAVE A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE. JEREMY LANE BIT ON THAT. AND SO FAR, THIS DRIVE COULD NOT BE GOING ANY BETTER FOR JOSH McDANIELS, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR. EXACTLY WHAT HE HOPED FOR BE ABLE TO POUND IT, QUICK PASSES. &gt;&gt; BRADY HAS MISSED ONLY ONE PASS 8 OF HIS FIRST 9. THE BALL IS AT THE 14. TOM AGAIN PROTECTED WELL. THROWS TO THE OUTSIDE, TO THE 10YARD LINE. THAT WILL BE ABOUT A 4YARD GAIN AS HOOMANAWANUI MAKES THE CATCH. IN THE RED ZONE, THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, THEY'VE BEEN INSIDE THE 20YARD LINE ON 10 OCCASIONS, HAVE SCORED 9 TOUCHDOWNS. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BRADY, CRIS LOOK, MOST QUARTERBACKS, OBVIOUSLY, WOULD BE BETTER IN A CLEAN POCKET, BUT TOM, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM IN A CLEAN POCKET AND GETTING CONTACTED IS ENORMOUS. &gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'S EASY TO HAVE A CLEAN POCKET WHEN YOU'RE THROWING IT AFTER ABOUT A SECOND AND A HALF. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. PART OF THE GAME PLAN. SECOND AND 6. AND STUFFED IN THE BACKFIELD. LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. THAT'S MICHAEL BENNETT, NUMBER 72, A GUY WHO, IN WHAT IS PRETTY MUCH A STANDARD TYPE OF DEFENSE THAT LETS THE GUYS JUST DO THEIR JOBS, HE'S THE ONE GUY WHO MOVES AROUND ON THE LINE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE. WILL PLAY ALL FIVE DEFENSIVE LINE POSITIONS. AND IT'S HIS QUICKNESS THAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR BILL BELICHICK AND THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. HE IS A GUY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND DOUBLETEAM AND HIT ON A SECONDARY SHOT FROM THE CENTER OR SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE HIS QUICKNESS CREATES REAL PROBLEMS. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE HAD THE BALL 7 1/2 MINUTES. HALF THE QUARTER. THIRD AND 6. BRADY DANCING. AND IT IS PICKED AT THE 5YARD LINE. JEREMY LANE! STILL ON THE RUN. TRIPPED UP. PETE CARROLL RIGHT THERE TO SALUTE HIM. SO THE DRIVE ENDS ON A THIRD AND 6 AS LANE PICKS IT OFF. AND HE'S DOWN. THEY'VE WRAPPED UP HIS LEFT ARM. THAT'S THE FIRST INTERCEPTION, REGULAR SEASON OR POSTSEASON, IN HIS THREE YEARS, BUT HE PAYS THE PRICE, AS HE GETS CARTED BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. BRADY UNDER SOME PRESSURE THAT TIME. THAT WAS A 13PLAY, 58YARD DRIVE. IT TOOK 7:41. ENDS WITH A PICK. &gt;&gt; HARD TO BELIEVE THAT TOM BRADY JUST MADE THAT MISTAKE. UNDER PRESSURE, YES, BUT REALLY JUST THREW THAT ONE UP. &gt;&gt; NEW ENGLAND'S RUN 19 PLAYS, SEATTLE'S RUN 3. ALL OF THEM RUNS BY LYNCH. THIS TIME IT IS WILSON LOOKING DOWNFIELD. TAKES CARE OF NINKOVICH WITH A GOOD FAKE. AND THERE HE GOES. SLIDING TO A STOP AT THE 21YARD LINE. AND THAT'S WHERE RUSSELL WILSON CAN REALLY KILL YOU, NOT ONLY WITH HIS ARM, BUT WITH HIS LEGS. AND BACK WE GO TO THE INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; HERE COMES BENNETT. SCHOFIELD'S GONNA GO DOWN INSIDE. WATCH HOW LONG BENNETT WAITS. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. HERE HE COMES. AND NOW ATTACKS TOM BRADY. AS SOON AS BRADY SEES HIM, HE BASICALLY TRIED TO JUST LEAN BACK A LITTLE BIT, AND THREW IT RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF JEREMY LANE. HUGE MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 3. WILSON YET TO THROW A PASS. HERE'S LYNCH. AND LOOK AT LYNCH. SO TYPICAL OF LYNCH. TURNS HIS SHOULDERS. THEY CALL HIM A SPLITLEGGED RUNNER. YOU SEE HOW HE'S BUILT. POWERFUL. KNOCKS OVER PEOPLE. HAS HAD SOME OF THE GREATEST RUNS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. FIRST DOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, NO ONE HAS MORE RUSHING YARDS, 100YARD GAMES, OR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS THAN THIS GUY. THEY CALL HIM BEAST MODE, AND YOU SEE WHY. THESE ARE LARGE HUMAN BEINGS, AND THEY SIMPLY CANNOT GET HIM ON THE GROUND. YOU SEE IT GAME AFTER GAME THAT WE DO. &gt;&gt; NOW WILSON. WITH FIVE RECEIVERS. JUST A THREEMAN RUSH FROM NEW ENGLAND. AND A SPY ON WILSON. HAS TIME. CAN'T GET ANY PRESSURE ON HIM. THERE HE GOES. AGAIN. LOOKING FOR THE FIRST DOWN, BUT COMING UP TO MAKE THE TACKLE IS DARRELLE REVIS. AND THAT IS A VERY FAST FIRST QUARTER THAT HAS JUST COME TO AN END. BACK TO GLENDALE. AL MICHAELS, CRIS COLLINSWORTH, MICHELE TAFOYA. THERE ARE YOUR NUMBERS THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER. NEW ENGLAND HAD THAT LONG DRIVE, AND THAT WAS ENDED WHEN LANE PICKED OFF THE PASS. THAT'S THE ONE TURNOVER. YOU KNOW, WE TALKED TO PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT, LET'S GO TO MICHELE FOR AN INJURY UPDATE. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED JEREMY LANE. IT WAS A COSTLY INTERCEPTION, AL. HE IS DOUBTFUL WITH A LEFTWRIST INJURY. HE HAS GONE BACK FOR XRAYS. YOU SAW HIM CARTED BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM. BUT THAT MAY BE THE ONLY PLAY HE MAKES TONIGHT, AL. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MICHELE. HIT BY JULIAN EDELMAN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND 12. HERE'S LYNCH. YOU KNOW, CRIS, WE TALKED TO PETE CARROLL YESTERDAY. I SAID, "YOU THINK THIS STARTS LIKE THE HAGLERHEARNS FIGHT WHERE THE GUYS COME OUT AND JUST TRY TO KILL EACH OTHER AT THE OUTSET, OR IS THIS MORE LIKE YOU'RE PARRYING, YOU'RE TRYING TO FEEL YOUR WAY THROUGH?" THAT'S THE WAY IT'S STARTED. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THESE TWO GREAT COACHES, THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO DO. AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN SUPER BOWLS BEFORE. SOMEHOW BILL BELICHICK HAS A WAY OF PLAYING IT A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO THE VEST. BUT THAT'S A HUGE MISS RIGHT THERE. WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST A DEFENSE LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T TURN IT OVER WHEN POINTS ARE SITTING THERE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 9, WITH FIVE RECEIVERS OUT THERE. WILSON IS UNDER SOME PRESSURE. BUT THERE HE IS ESCAPING AND SURVEYING. NOW HE'LL GO BACK THE OTHER WAY. HE GETS A NICE BLOCK. AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. DOWNFIELD, INTENDED FOR BRYAN WALTERS. SO NOBODY COULD GET OPEN. PRESSURE WAS PUT ON. FOURTH AND 9. &gt;&gt; WELL, HERE'S THE KEY THE PATRIOTS ARE GOING ALL MANTOMAN COVERAGE. LOOK, ACROSS THE BOARD. THERE'S REVIS RIGHT THERE ON DOUG BALDWIN. THAT'S GOING TO BE HIS MATCH THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DAY. THE RECEIVERS ARE SCRAMBLING AROUND, TRYING TO MAKE A PLAY. THERE JUST WAS ABSOLUTELY NOBODY OPEN ANYWHERE. AND FOR RUSSELL WILSON, HE REALLY NEEDS TO FIND A LITTLE RHYTHM THROWING THE BALL, BUT SO FAR THIS COVERAGE TOO MUCH. &gt;&gt; 0 FOR 1 IS WILSON. THE OTHER PLAY WAS A SACK. REVIS GOT CREDIT FOR A SACK ON THE PLAY THAT ENDED THE FIRST QUARTER. NOW THE KICK HERE BY JON RYAN. JULIAN EDELMAN. SHORT KICK. FIELDS AT THE 34. DOES A LITTLE DANCING TO THE OUTSIDE. TACKLED, AFTER A RUNBACK OF 2, BY BROCK COYLE. LATE AFTERNOON HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX STADIUM. DARRELL BEVELL GOING OVER THINGS WITH RUSSELL WILSON. AND BRADY STARTS THIS DRIVE FROM THE 35YARD LINE. BLOUNT IS THE BACK. AN ERRANT SNAP, BUT HE COLLECTS IT AND THEN HITS AMENDOLA, WHO'S NOW CAUGHT THREE. AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN BEFORE EARL THOMAS RUNS HIM INTO THE PATRIOT BENCH. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE'VE SEEN MICHAEL BENNETT HAVE AN EARLY IMPACT ON THIS GAME FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES. DAN CONNOLLY UNABLE TO GET HIS HANDS ON HIM. THEN IN THE RUN GAME, RYAN WENDELL, WHO CAN'T BLOCK HIM. AND THEN THE STUNT, WHERE HE'S GOING TO COME ALL THE WAY AROUND. AND THIS PRESSURE LEADS TO THE BIG INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GAIN OF 17 ON THE LAST PLAY. GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD PLAY ACTION, BUT GOOD COVERAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE INCOMPLETE. THAROLD SIMON MAKES A NICE PLAY. BRANDON LaFELL, THE INTENDED RECEIVER. AND SIMON IS IN FOR LANE, WHO IS MOST LIKELY DONE FOR THE DAY, SO THERE IS YOUR NEW NICKEL. AND, BOY, THAT LEGION OF BOOM RIGHT NOW LANE, WHO IS KIND OF A SUPPORTING ACTOR, IS OUT. YOU'VE GOT THE ELBOW FOR SHERMAN. YOU GOT CHANCELLOR'S KNEE. AND YOU HAVE THOMAS' SHOULDER. &gt;&gt; AND SIMON'S GOT A BRACE THERE. IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR, AL. YOU JUST HAVE TO STRAP IT ON AND GO PLAY. &gt;&gt; VEREEN IS THE BACK IN THIS SET. THERE GOES EDELMAN OUT OF THE SLOT. BRADY, QUICK FLIP OVER THE MIDDLE. CAUGHT. THAT'S BRANDON LaFELL. HAD A NICE YEAR. CAME OVER FROM CAROLINA. PLAYED FOUR YEARS THERE, WAS AN UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENT. THAT WILL MAKE IT THIRD DOWN AND 3. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE CHANGEUP RIGHT HERE. NOW YOU SEE WHAT'S CALLED A BULL RUSH. THEY SET HIM UP WITH THE SPIN MOVE INSIDE, NATE SOLDER. THEY'VE BEEN OUTSIDE. AND THAT TIME, THEY TRY TO GO RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. SO FAR, NATE SOLDER'S HOLDING UP WELL. &gt;&gt; SOLDER, THE ONLY FIRSTROUND DRAFT CHOICE STARTING FOR THE PATRIOT OFFENSE. THIRD AND 3. BRADY OUT OF THE POCKET. AND HE CONNECTS HERE. THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. VEREEN TO THE OUTSIDE. AND BOBBY WAGNER SAID, "UGH!" CLAPPING HIS HANDS. SHOULD HAVE STOPPED HIM, COULDN'T FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING, AL. THEY ARE JUST BASICALLY YOU KNOW, IN BASKETBALL, YOU CLEAR A ZONE, YOU LET A MICHAEL JORDAN OR SOMEBODY GO ONEONONE? IT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING THAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SHANE VEREEN, THEY'RE CLEARING OUT A ZONE, LETTING HIM GET INTO A ZONE WITH ONE OF THOSE LINEBACKERS, AND JUST TRY AND MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS, GET HIM THE BALL AND ALLOW HIM TO BREAK A TACKLE AND PICK UP A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; SURGICAL. SHERMAN ON THE OUTSIDE, LINED UP AT THE BOTTOM AGAINST LaFELL. BRADY, GOOD PLAY FAKE, GOOD TIME. DEEPEST PASS OF THE DAY FOR HIM. AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. GRONKOWSKI WITH SOME CONTACT AT THE END OF THE PLAY, BUT THERE IS NO FLAG. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 10. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR SEAHAWK FANS BECAUSE HERE'S KAM CHANCELLOR'S FIRST SHOT RUNNING DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST GRONKOWSKI. ALMOST CAME BACK UNDERNEATH AND MADE THE PLAY. BUT SO MANY TIMES WE SEE THIS NEW ENGLAND OFFENSE REALLY GET A JUMP START WHEN GRONKOWSKI STARTS TO GET INTO THE GAME, AND SO FAR, NOT A FACTOR. &gt;&gt; IN ALL OF BRADY'S SUPER BOWLS THREE WINS, TWO LOSSES ON PASSES THAT HE'S THROWN MORE THAN 20 YARDS FROM THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, HE'S 1 FOR 22. SO HE'S BEEN GREAT ON THE SHORT STUFF. HERE HE HANDS THE BALL OFF ON SECOND DOWN. IT GOES TO SHANE VEREEN. TO THE 35YARD LINE. GAIN OF 1. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, SOME OF THE QUICKNESS NOW STARTING TO SHOW UP. AND FOR PETE CARROLL, HE HAS TO BE SO PROUD OF HIS DEFENSE. YOU THINK OF WHAT THEY DID IN THAT CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY, SURVIVING ALL THOSE TURNOVERS. AND HERE COMES BENNETT AGAIN, INSIDE, FLYING THROUGH THERE. EVEN WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BACK SIDE, YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR THAT QUICKNESS. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 9. THIS WILL BE THE 26th PLAY RUN BY NEW ENGLAND. SEATTLE HAS RUN 8. BRADY PROTECTED AGAIN. THROWS CAUGHT ON THE RUN BY EDELMAN. HE'LL TAKE THE BALL TO ABOUT THE 10YARD LINE. JULIAN EDELMAN GETS FREE OVER THE MIDDLE. ON A THIRDAND9 PLAY, THAT'S 23 YARDS. &gt;&gt; SO THE INJURY SHOWING UP ALREADY HERE NOW. JEREMY LANE WOULD BE IN THAT POSITION. NOW IT'S THAROLD SIMON. AND JULIAN EDELMAN TOO QUICK. SO YOU WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD ATTACK DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST THE RICHARD SHERMANS. CLEARLY, THEY HAVE NOT TRIED TO DO ANY OF THAT. BUT THESE INSIDE ROUTES, THE QUICKNESS OF THOSE TWO GUYS SHANE VEREEN, JULIAN EDELMAN NOW SHOWING UP. &gt;&gt; SO THE SECOND DEEP SURGE BY NEW ENGLAND. THE FIRST ENDED WITH THE INTERCEPTION. AND THIS IS BLOUNT GOING NOWHERE. GAIN OF 1 TO THE 11YARD LINE. IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN AND 9. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST LITTLE TACKLEELIGIBLE PLAY HERE. OF COURSE, THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION EARLIER. SO YOU GET CAMERON FLEMING IN THERE. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE. THAT ONE'S JUST SORT OF A BLUFF. WILL THEY COME BACK AND HAVE SOME SORT OF A PLAY WHERE HE'S ELIGIBLE, RECEIVER'S INELIGIBLE? WE'VE SEEN THEM ALL FROM JOSH McDANIELS. &gt;&gt; YES, WE HAVE. FLEMING OVER TWO DOZEN TIMES REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS. SECOND AND 9. BRADY THROWS CAUGHT! LaFELL, TOUCHDOWN! BRANDON LaFELL, FROM CAROLINA TO NEW ENGLAND AS A FREE AGENT, MAKES THE CATCH, AND NEW ENGLAND STRIKES FIRST. &gt;&gt; GOING RIGHT AFTER THAROLD SIMON. YOU KNEW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. HARD SLANT INSIDE, AND THEN WATCH THE TAIL END OF THIS PLAY. IT IS EARL THOMAS THAT COMES OVER, AND SIMON ENDS UP HOLDING HIS ARM OR SHOULDER AFTER TAKING THE BRUNT OF THAT HIT. THEY DON'T HAVE MANY CORNERS LEFT TO PLAY, SO THEY NEED ALL THESE GUYS TO STAY HEALTHY. &gt;&gt; GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. SO BRADY PUTS SIMON IN THE CROSSHAIRS. IT'S THE GRAND CANYON STATE. ONE OF THE YOUNGER STATES, OBVIOUSLY. THE 48th STATE. ONLY HAWAII AND ALASKA HAVE BEEN IN THE UNION A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. RUSSELL WILSON READY TO COME BACK OUT. NINE FIRST DOWNS FOR NEW ENGLAND, ONE FOR SEATTLE. TOTAL PLAYS, 288. GOSTKOWSKI TO KICK OFF. AND DOUG BALDWIN WILL MOVE TO HIS RIGHT AND JUST LET IT FLOP OUT OF THE END ZONE. 9:47 LEFT IN THE HALF. WILSON READY TO TAKE OVER. RAISED THE LOMBARDI TROPHY LAST YEAR AND TOLD US WHEN HE PUT IT DOWN, ALL HE COULD THINK ABOUT WAS DOING IT AGAIN NEXT YEAR. WELL, HERE IS NEXT YEAR, AND HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME AT THE 18YARD LINE. CHANDLER JONES COMES IN TO TAKE HIM DOWN TO MAKE IT SECOND DOWN AND 12. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE, BUT RUSSELL OKUNG IS GONNA PULL OUT, AND CHANDLER JONES IS GOING TO END UP ON THE GUARD, JAMES CARPENTER. MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN HE WAS COMING OUT FOR THE ROUTE, KIND OF KNOCKED CARPENTER OFF. SO, SO FAR HERE, RUSSELL WILSON HAS GOTTEN NOTHING GOING AT ALL. SORT OF LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY. 0 FOR 4 IN THAT ONE, FOUR INTERCEPTIONS UNTIL FOUR MINUTES TO GO IN THE GAME, A QUARTERBACK RATING OF 7. &gt;&gt; WILSON HASN'T COMPLETED A PASS. BRADY'S COMPLETED 14. TO THE 21YARD LINE GOES LYNCH. TACKLED THERE BY JAMIE COLLINS. SETTING UP A THIRD DOWN AND LONG. MAKE IT THIRD AND 8. &gt;&gt; ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING MOVES HERE, THEY'RE BRINGING JAMIE COLLINS HERE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO GO SIDELINE TO SIDELINE WITH HIM. THE FEELING WAS THAT NOT ONLY COULD HE END UP SNIFFING OUT THE RUNS OF MARSHAWN LYNCH, BUT IF RUSSELL WILSON STARTS TO GET LOOSE ON THE EDGE, HE COULD RUN HIM DOWN, AS WELL. A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THIS GAME, JAMIE COLLINS. &gt;&gt; 8 1/2 LEFT IN THE HALF. THIRD AND 8. WILSON. GOING DEEP DOWN THE SIDELINE. AND BROKEN UP. LOGAN RYAN, THE NICKEL, KNOCKED IT AWAY FROM JERMAINE KEARSE. AND IT'S ANOTHER QUICK THREEANDOUT FOR THE SEAHAWKS. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA ASK ME WHAT THE STORY LINE OF THIS GAME HAS BEEN SO FAR? I WILL TELL YOU THE UTTER DOMINATION IN MAN COVERAGE OF THE PATRIOTS' COVERAGE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE'S BEEN NOWHERE TO THROW THIS FOOTBALL. I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT ON ALMOST EVERY PLAY. THERE JUST IS NOTHING THERE. THEY'RE SPYING, THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF RUSSELL WILSON IN CASE HE WANTS TO RUN, AND THE COVERAGE PEOPLE DOWN THE FIELD ARE WINNING. &gt;&gt; GAME IS ALMOST 22 MINUTES OLD, AND WILSON HAS NOT COMPLETED A PASS. JON RYAN. GOOD, DEEP. BEAUTIFUL KICK. FIELDED AT THE 17 BY EDELMAN. RUNS INTO HIS OWN MAN. AND THEN RUNS OUT OF ROOM, AND HE'S TAKEN OUT OF BOUNDS AT ABOUT THE 27YARD LINE. IT'S THE OLD ADAGE, DEFENSE WINS SUPER BOWLS. THERE'S A LIST OF THE TEAMS THAT LED THE LEAGUE IN FEWEST POINTS AND YARDS ALLOWED. AND ONLY THE CHIEFS IN THE LAST SUPER BOWL BEFORE THE AFLNFL MERGER WOULD HAVE LOST, BUT THEY LOST TO THE NFL's NUMBERONE DEFENSE, AS THE VIKINGS WERE NUMBER ONE. THEY WERE THE TEAM THAT LOST TO THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS BACK IN SUPER BOWL IV, AND THEN THE MERGER TOOK PLACE THE NEXT YEAR. &gt;&gt; DEFENSE CAN'T WIN ANYTHING, THOUGH, IF YOUR OFFENSE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING ON THEIR SIDE. 14022, THE TOTAL YARDS. &gt;&gt; CRAZY. &gt;&gt; GOODNESS GRACIOUS. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GOT GRONKOWSKI OUTSIDE. LaFELL IS ON THE SLOT TO THE LEFT. WILL THEY START TO PICK ON SIMON AGAIN? EDELMAN NOW SETS UP ON THE LEFT SIDE. HE'S GOT THREE GUYS COMING OUT OF THE LEFT SIDE. LOOKS THAT WAY, AND HAS IT BATTED DOWN AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. IT'S TONY McDANIEL, 6'7", 305, OUT OF TENNESSEE, BATTING IT. SECOND AND 10. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY BECAUSE NOW BRADY HAS GOT THEM SO FRUSTRATED WITH THESE QUICK THROWS, YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE PASS RUSHERS OF SEATTLE EVEN MAKING MOVES. THEY'RE BASICALLY HAVING TO JUST GO PUSH INTO THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN AND THEN TRY TO GET THEIR HANDS UP BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA GET THERE. &gt;&gt; THREE RECEIVERS ARE SET ON THE LEFT SIDE AGAIN. BRADY. CHECKING THE MIDDLE. THROWS. CUTTING OVER THE MIDDLE IS JULIAN EDELMAN. THEY TACKLE HIM. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. BOBBY WAGNER, THE MIDDLE LINEBACKER WHO WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS TEAM WHEN HE GOT HEALTHY, MAKES THE STOP. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, HERE'S BOBBY WAGNER RIGHT HERE. AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE RUNNING SHANE VEREEN OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. THEN THEY'RE RUNNING THE TIGHT END OR SLOT ON THAT SIDE UP THE SEAM. SO ALL THEY'RE DOING IS CLEARING OUT AN ENTIRE ZONE AND LEAVING EDELMAN ONEONONE WITH BOBBY WAGNER, AND THEY ARE WINNING THE GAME WITH THAT STRATEGY. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 3. VEREEN. MOTION TO THE INSIDE. BRADY. ESCAPING. TURNS THE SHOULDERS, AND THE PASS IS DEFLECTED AND INCOMPLETE. SO IT'S FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE TOM BRADY WAS LOOKING DOWN THE FIELD, AND HIS RECEIVER GOT KNOCKED DOWN, SO HE BASICALLY JUST TRIED TO HOLD ON TO IT. HE SAW HIS RECEIVER ON THE GROUND. COULDN'T TELL WHO THAT WAS. MAYBE EDELMAN. EVERY RECEIVER'S ON THE GROUND. GRONKOWSKI AND EDELMAN KIND OF RAN INTO EACH OTHER. BRADY SAID, "I BETTER NOT THROW THIS ONE." &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST THREEANDOUT. RYAN ALLEN TO PUNT. BRYAN WALTERS SET TO RUN IT BACK. AND IT BOUNCES AT THE 29YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WHO'S HERE? WELL, JOHN TRAVOLTA. THERE HE IS. KEVIN HART. SITTING NEXT TO WILL FERRELL. A FEW JOKES IN THAT LUXURY SUITE. MARK WAHLBERG LOVES HIS NEW ENGLAND TEAMS. KENNY CHESNEY LOOKING ON. STEVEN TYLER IS ALSO A HUGE PATRIOT FAN. AND WE HAVE ROYALTY, AS WELL. FROM LIVERPOOL. PAUL McCARTNEY. NOW, FROM THE 30. THEY START THIS DRIVE, DO THE SEAHAWKS, WITH LYNCH. AND LYNCH WITH SOME TOUGH RUNNING. ALWAYS TOUGH RUNNING FROM MARSHAWN. UP TO THE 35YARD LINE. GAIN OF 5. MATT PATRICIA IS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB. AND ONE OF THESE GUYS ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO MAYBE NEXT YEAR WILL BE IN LINE TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR A HEADCOACHING SPOT. &gt;&gt; SO MANY OF THESE RUNS OF MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHEN THEY START LEFT, THEY GO BACK RIGHT. AND THE PATRIOTS ARE KIND OF CRASHING IN FROM THAT SIDE AND TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THAT CUTBACK LANE, AND IT'S BEEN WORKING PRETTY WELL SO FAR. &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. THIS TIME, STRAIGHT AHEAD. BUT JUST BACKS HIS WAY FOR AN EXTRA YARD, YARD AND A HALF TO SET UP A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. &gt;&gt; DONT'A HIGHTOWER, RIGHT HERE, THE BIG GUY IN THE MIDDLE. JUST GOING TO TRY TO COME IN THERE, AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO OCCUPY EVERY SINGLE LANE THAT THERE IS. JUST DON'T ALLOW THAT BIG GUY TO GET STARTED, BECAUSE WHEN HE STARTS WITH THOSE JUMP CUTS, HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS, NONE OF THEM ARE GONNA GET HIM. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN, A YARD AND A HALF. AND A WHISTLE HERE. WE'VE HAD A PENALTYFREE GAME. WE HAD ONE PENALTY, AND IT WAS DECLINED. BILL VINOVICH WILL FINALLY TAKE THE MIKE. &gt;&gt; FALSE START. OFFENSE, NUMBER 82. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO A THIRD AND 1 BECOMES A THIRD AND 6. THAT'S LUKE WILLSON, 82, THE TIGHT END. THAT'S THE SECONDLONGEST INTO A GAME WITHOUT A COMPLETION. NEW ENGLAND IN SUPER BOWL XX, GOING ALL THE WAY BACK. THAT WAS AGAINST THE '85 BEARS. THEY GOT THEIR FIRST COMPLETION WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO IN THE HALF. WE HAVE 5:44 HERE, BUT A THIRD DOWN AND 6 NOW. FROM THE 34YARD LINE. TO THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT. CAN HE GET THE FIRST DOWN? WELL, WE'LL SEE WHERE THEY SPOT IT. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM A PRETTY GOOD SPOT HERE, AS BROWNER IS ABLE TO TACKLE KEARSE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO SPOT IT RIGHT AT THE 40, AND THAT WILL BE A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND DESPERATELY NEEDED. HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, GOING AGAINST BRANDON BROWNER OF COURSE, FORMER MEMBER OF THE LEGION OF BOOM. DOES HE GET THAT THING TURNED OVER? I THINK HE DOES. PRETTY GOOD SPOT THERE. AND THAT WAS A BIG ONE. YOU GET THE PENALTY, YOU GET KNOCKED BACK FROM A THIRD AND 1, AND FINALLY RUSSELL WILSON STEPS UP AND MAKES A PLAY. &gt;&gt; SO KEARSE CATCHES WILSON'S FIRST COMPLETION. AND NOW LYNCH TO THE 45. YOU LOOK AT THESE SEATTLE RECEIVERS, CRIS, IT'S A FUNNY GROUP. THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF HEADLINES. NONE OF THEM WERE DRAFTED. NONE. REMEMBER LAST YEAR, THEY HAD GOLDEN TATE. HE WENT TO DETROIT. THEY HAD PERCY HARVIN. THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A STAR THIS YEAR FOR THEM, AND THEN HE RAN HIS WAY OUT OF SEATTLE, AND THEY TRADED HIM TO THE NEW YORK JETS. PAUL RICHARDSON, A ROOKIE, GOT HURT. SO ALL FIVE OF THE GUYS WHO ARE RECEIVERS ARE FREE AGENTS. &gt;&gt; AND THEY GET UPSET WHEN ANYBODY SAYS NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT THEM. BUT HERE'S THEIR MOMENT. THIS IS WHEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WIN THE GAME. AND LUKE WILLSON NEEDS TO HELP, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; THE FAKE. WILSON, WHO HAS GOT A GREAT ARM. DOWNFIELD, TURNING AND MAKING THE CATCH! TWISTING AND TURNING IS CHRIS MATTHEWS. ANOTHER OF THOSE FREE AGENTS. A GUY WHO HAS PLAYED VERY LITTLE OFFENSE THIS YEAR, BUT THE GUY WHO RECOVERED THAT ONSIDE KICK THAT WAS SO HUGE IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S A BIG GUY, AL. REMEMBER WATCHING IN PRACTICE THE OTHER DAY, HOW GREAT RUSSELL WILSON WAS AT THROWING THE DEEP BALL? FINALLY NOW HE GETS ONE COMPLETION, THEY TAKE A SHOT AND NOW THE SUBSTITUTION IS HAPPENING AND THE REFEREES ARE HOLDING UP PLAY SO THEY CAN'T GET THAT QUICK SNAP. &gt;&gt; THEY RACE TO THE LINE. HERE'S LYNCH. AND LYNCH TAKES THE BALL TO THE 7 AS THE CROWD CHANTS "BEAST" AT LEAST THE SEATTLE PORTION. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE CATCH BY CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DID NOT CATCH A PASS THIS SEASON. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. HOW ABOUT THAT ONE? ARRINGTON ALL OVER HIM, IN PERFECT COVERAGE. BUT THE ONE THING I LOVE WATCHING WITH RUSSELL WILSON NOT ONLY DOES HE THROW THE DEEP BALL WELL, BUT HE THROWS THEM HIGH. HE HAS ENOUGH STRENGTH IN HIS ARM TO GET IT UP HIGH SO A BIG, TALL RECEIVER LIKE MATTHEWS CAN GO UP AND GET IT. &gt;&gt; TUKUAFU IS NOW IN THE GAME AT FULLBACK TO PROVIDE LEVERAGE FOR LYNCH. HERE GOES LYNCH TO THE LEFT SIDE. HE GETS IT DOWN TO THE 2YARD LINE. CHANDLER JONES MAKES THE TACKLE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND A LONG YARD. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, CHANDLER JONES JUST TOOK THE HELMET RIGHT OFF OF JAMES CARPENTER ON THAT ONE. THERE IS SOME FIGHTS GOING ON INSIDE IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME. THIS IS JUST MAN ON MAN. HERE WE GO RIGHT HERE. I MEAN, THIS IS UP AND DOWN THE LINE. YOU CAN ALMOST PICK OUT ANY BATTLE YOU WANT TO SEE. HIGHTOWER, JAMIE COLLINS, CHANDLER JONES. IT'S LIKE THAT ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THIS LINE. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 2 FROM THE 3. WILSON. TO LYNCH. TOUCHDOWN! MARSHAWN LYNCH, WHO LED THE LEAGUE IN TOUCHDOWNS THIS SEASON WITH 17. 13 ON THE GROUND. IT'S ALL SET UP BY THE PASS TO MATTHEWS. AND WE'RE AN EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM A TIE GAME. &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU GET VINCE WILFORK CONTAINED THEY GET THE DOUBLETEAM ON HIM, AND THEN WE'VE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES MARSHAWN LYNCH, YOU GIVE HIM A LITTLE SPACE. THEY HIT THE BIG PASS, AND NOW THE RUNNING GAME FINALLY OPENS UP. AND SEATTLE, AFTER DOING NOTHING, ANSWERS IN A BIG WAY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A LITTLE BRAWL. HELMETS FLYING OFF ON JUST ABOUT EVERY PLAY. &gt;&gt; WE GOT A SUPER BOWL GOING NOW. &gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; AND JUST LIKE GREEN BAY, YOU WONDER, DOES IT COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM IN SOME WAY, NOT BEING ABLE TO CONVERT EARLY IN THIS GAME? &gt;&gt; MMHMM. MEANWHILE, DONT'A HIGHTOWER GOT HURT, AND HE'S BEING ASSISTED OFF THE FIELD. THERE'S THE LINEBACKER, RIGHT THERE. BACK TO THE BENCH HE GOES. 2:16 LEFT IN A VERY, VERY FAST FIRST HALF. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT WE'VE HAD ONLY ONE ACCEPTED PENALTY. AND ONE DECLINED PENALTY. &gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU'RE A PATRIOTS FAN, DONT'A HIGHTOWER COULD NOT BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME BECAUSE OF MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; HIGHTOWER BATTLING A SHOULDER INJURY FOR MUCH OF THE SEASON. THAT WAS A 70YARD, 8PLAY DRIVE. SIX RUSHES, TWO PASSES. EXTRA POINT BY HAUSCHKA IS GOOD. LOOKING DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROOF, THE RETRACTABLE ROOF. THEY GROW THE GRASS OUTSIDE AND THEN WHEEL IT IN. THE GRASS IS GROWN IN ALABAMA. BUNCH OF TRUCKS BROUGHT IT IN. &gt;&gt; HOME OF? &gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO HOME OF KEN STABLER. FOLEY, ALABAMA. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; DOWN BY THE GULF. SO, SO MUCH MADE ABOUT THE FOOTBALLS AND WHERE THEY'D BE AND UNDER LOCK AND KEY. AND THEY'VE BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THERE THEY ARE. ALL OF THEM 12.5 TO 13.5 POUNDS. CRIS, I WAS THINKING, YOU KNEW NEIL ARMSTRONG NOT SINCE ARMSTRONG STEPPED ON THE MOON HAVE MORE ASTROPHYSICISTS BEEN INTERVIEWED ON TELEVISION THAN THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; I THINK WE KNOW ALL WE EVER NEED TO KNOW ABOUT POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, THAT WAS AN INTERESTING DAY WITH THE PATRIOTS THIS WEEK, THOUGH, WASN'T IT? &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. &gt;&gt; I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE DIRECT WITH MY QUESTIONING OF BILL BELICHICK, TOM BRADY, ROBERT KRAFT. THEY ALL ABSOLUTELY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE, ANY INVOLVEMENT, ANY POSSIBILITY, ANYTHING THEY SAID COULD HAVE LED TO INTENTIONALLY DEFLATING THOSE BALLS. &gt;&gt; YOU SAW ROBERT AND JONATHAN KRAFT. INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. BOB KRAFT PUT ALL OF HIS CHIPS ON THE TABLE WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED AN APOLOGY FROM THE LEAGUE WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. MEANWHILE, AMENDOLA, BEFORE HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS, PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AT THE 31YARD LINE. SO IT ALL STARTED YOU ALL KNOW IT. I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WERE, I DON'T KNOW, SOMEPLACE, SOME OTHER PLANET, BUT THE DEFLATED FOOTBALLS WHICH THEY DISCOVERED AT HALFTIME IN THE INDIANAPOLIS GAME, AND ALL OF THE WACKINESS AND CRAZINESS THAT LED UP TO TONIGHT. QUARTERBACK COMPARISON. WEIRD NUMBERS. BRADY WITH A LOT OF SHORT STUFF. AND THEN THE ONE PASS TO LaFELL GOT THEM INTO THE END ZONE. AND THEN WILSON DID NOT COMPLETE A PASS UNTIL THAT LAST DRIVE. HAD THE 6YARDER TO KEARSE AND THEN THE 44YARDER TO MATTHEWS. JUST TWO COMPLETIONS, BUT THAT SET UP LYNCH TO GET INTO THE END ZONE. THUS AT THE 2MINUTE WARNING, WE ARE KNOTTED AT 7. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN THE PATRIOTS ARE AT THEIR BEST. THEY LED THE NFL WITH 66 POINTS IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE FIRST HALF. LET'S SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO HERE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. STARTING THE DRIVE FROM THE 31YARD LINE. BEGIN ON THE GROUND. BLOUNT. AVOIDING TACKLERS. FIGHTING HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN. GETS TO THE 41YARD LINE. SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT, THOUGH. THEY'RE GOING TO MARK IT A LITTLE BIT SHORT. INCHES SHORT. SECOND AND INCHES. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE BEEN STARTING A LOT OF THESE DRIVES WITH CAMERON FLEMING IN AT TIGHT END. THAT TIME THEY RAN RIGHT BEHIND HIM. GREAT DRIVE START. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND INCHES. BRADY FLIPS IT QUICKLY. THAT CONVERTS. VEREEN GETS TAKEN DOWN. BOBBY WAGNER, THE LINEBACKER, COVERING HIM ON THE OUTSIDE. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING. THEY'VE BEEN TAKING VEREEN RIGHT OUT OF THE BACKFIELD AND THEN WORKING HIM WIDE AND CREATING SOME SPACE INSIDE, SO THAT TIME THEY FINALLY THROW IT TO HIM. &gt;&gt; TICKING DOWN TO A MINUTE. BRADY. GOOD PROTECTION. DEEP ON THE OUTSIDE. AND OVER THE HEAD AND INCOMPLETE OF DANNY AMENDOLA. BYRON MAXWELL COVERING. SECOND AND 10 FOR THE PATRIOTS. PATRIOTS, 66 POINTS IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; AL, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY GRONKOWSKI HASN'T BEEN MUCH OF A FACTOR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE LURK COVERAGES WHERE KAM CHANCELLOR NOW IS WALKING DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD WITH REALLY NO RESPONSIBILITY NUMBER 31. AND SO IF GRONKOWSKI COMES ON ONE OF THOSE CROSSING ROUTES, HE'S RIGHT THERE TO PICK IT UP. &gt;&gt; THE DEFENSE CROWDING THE LINE, AS SHERMAN'S GOING TO GO TO THE OUTSIDE, MIRRORING EDELMAN, WHO GETS IT, AND THEN HE'S JUST TRIPPED UP AFTER A SHORT GAIN. YOU HAD EDELMAN GOING ACROSS THE FORMATION AND SHERMAN FOLLOWING HIM. &gt;&gt; THE OLD JET SWEEP, RIGHT? YOU JUST TURN AROUND, AND IT'S RIGHT THERE. AND THEN BRUCE IRVIN, AS ATHLETIC AS HE IS, HE JUST CAN'T REACT TO IT THAT QUICKLY. NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE A JULIAN EDELMAN ON YOUR TEAM THAT CAN DO SO MANY THINGS. OF COURSE, ONE OF THE BIG PLAYS OF THIS PLAYOFF RUN WAS HIS TOUCHDOWN PASS ON THAT DOUBLE PASS TO DANNY AMENDOLA. &gt;&gt; IN THE GAME AGAINST BALTIMORE, WHERE THEY ERASED TWO 14POINT DEFICITS. THIRD AND 3. OH! AND JUMPING ACROSS AND THEY WHISTLE IT DEAD BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE GONE UNABATED TO THE QUARTERBACK WAS CLIFF AVRIL. SO HE'S OFFSIDE. AND THAT IS A FREE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; NEUTRALZONE INFRACTION, DEFENSE, NUMBER 56. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT JUST DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN A THIRD AND LESS THAN 5, EVERYBODY ON THAT DEFENSIVE LINE SHOULD BE YELLING, "DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP!" AND THEN IT'S THE VETERAN, CLIFF AVRIL, WHO WAS SO BIG, I THOUGHT, IN THE GAME AGAINST PEYTON MANNING LAST YEAR BUT REALLY HAS BEEN A NONFACTOR SO FAR HERE. &gt;&gt; SEAHAWKS WERE THE MOST PENALIZED TEAM IN THE LEAGUE THIS SEASON. AND THEIR OPPONENTS DREW FEWER PENALTIES. IT WAS LIKE A 2TO1 RATIO FOR THE SEAHAWKS THIS YEAR, THEIR PENALTIES AGAINST THE OPPOSITION. COSTLY ONE THERE. THE BALL AT THE 44. FIRST DOWN. BRADY. LOW THROW, BUT CAUGHT. OFF THE SHOE TOPS OF SHANE VEREEN, WHO GETS THE BALL TO THE 26YARD LINE. NEW ENGLAND WITH ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS, AND THEY WILL ELECT TO USE THEIR FIRST RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; THERE WE GO, OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. AGAIN, CLEAR THE SPACE, CLEAR THE ZONE. ONEONONE ROUTE. JUST LET THEM GO TO WORK. THEY'RE DROPPING DOWN EARL THOMAS THAT TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD, BUT HE JUST COULDN'T QUITE GET THERE. YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THAT BATTLE AGAINST A LINEBACKER LIKE BOBBY WAGNER, BUT EARL THOMAS KIND OF GOT PICKED OFF AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE. &gt;&gt; COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA HALFTIME REPORT, THE GUYS WILL BREAK DOWN THE FIRST HALF, TELL YOU WHAT EACH TEAM NEEDS TO DO IN THE SECOND HALF. TWO COACHES WHO CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. COMING UP ON THE TOYOTA HALFTIME. BILL BELICHICK. HE'S WON MORE POSTSEASON GAMES THAN ANY COACH IN HISTORY. 21. 20 OF THOSE WITH THE PATRIOTS. YOU FORGET HE WON ONE OF THOSE WITH THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. COACHED THERE FOR FIVE YEARS AND WENT TO NEW ENGLAND IN 2000. YOU GOT GRONKOWSKI MATCHED UP WITH SHERMAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. AND THE PASS IS FLIPPED TO THE OUTSIDE FOR A SHORT GAIN. VEREEN GETS SHOVED OUT OF BOUNDS. AND IT WILL BE SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS, IF THEY KEEP GOING TO THESE QUICK PLAYS, YOU HAVE THE OPTION, IF YOU'RE SEATTLE, TO MAYBE BRING IN SOME EXTRA CORNERS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, REALLY, IT'S THAROLD SIMON THEY'RE ALL OUT THERE ON THE FIELD ALREADY. SO OPTIONS LIMITED. SO RIGHT NOW THE PATRIOTS SAYING, "WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THIS SPREADOUT LOOK AND ALL THESE RECEIVERS BECAUSE WE LIKE THE DEFENSIVE BACKS ON THE FIELD RIGHT NOW THAT THEY HAVE." &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE SHERMAN YOU CAN SEE HIM. HE'S IN THE SLOT. AND BRADY'S GOING TO THROW DEEP DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE FOR GRONKOWSKI. AND A TOUCHDOWN! AND THE EARTHQUAKE SPIKE. SEE, YOU'VE GOT THE LINEBACKER COVERING HIM. AND GRONKOWSKI IS ABLE TO HAUL IT IN. K.J. WRIGHT COULDN'T HANG WITH HIM. 22 YARDS FOR THE SCORE. &gt;&gt; AL, IT'S AMAZING, IS THAT THE PATRIOTS KNEW COMING INTO THIS GAME THAT IF K.J. WRIGHT WALKED OUT, HE WAS GONNA BE ABOUT 8 YARDS OFF AND WAY INSIDE, AND THAT SIGNALED MAN COVERAGE. IT ALWAYS SIGNALS MAN COVERAGE WHEN THEY'RE IN THERE. THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT THE SNAP OF THE BALL WHERE THAT ONE WAS GOING. GRONKOWSKI AGAINST K.J. WRIGHT, A MISMATCH. CHANCELLOR, MAYBE. THAT ONE WON'T WORK. &gt;&gt; 1:45 THEY WENT 80 YARDS IN EIGHT PLAYS. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. WELL, THAT WOULD FIGURE. MOST CAREER T.D. PASSES IN A SUPER BOWL JOE MONTANA AND TOM BRADY EACH WITH 11. TWO TONIGHT FOR TOM. &gt;&gt; HAD THE ONE MISTAKE EARLY, AND SINCE THEN HAS BEEN RAZOR SHARP, HASN'T HE? &gt;&gt; MMHMM. 20 OF 27, 177. A LOT OF SHORT STUFF, BUT TWICE HE'S GONE LONG AND IT'S PAID OFF FOR HIM. LaFELL AND GRONKOWSKI. &gt;&gt; AMAZING THAT THE BIG INTERCEPTION BY JEREMY LANE COULD HAVE ACTUALLY TURNED THE GAME IN FAVOR OF THE PATRIOTS. HE GOES OUT, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE QUITE THE COVERAGE TEAM. &gt;&gt; GREAT POINT. LOSE A GUY LIKE THAT. TRY TO WORK AROUND IT. AND NOW THIS WILL BE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE END ZONE. SO WITH 31 SECONDS, THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS NOT THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET THEM IN WITH 31 SECONDS, BUT LET'S SEE IF WILSON CAN GET THEM INTO FIELDGOAL RANGE. &gt;&gt; NATE SOLDER RIGHT THERE. HANDLED THE SPIN MOVE PRETTY MUCH. AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, SEBASTIAN VOLLMER GOING AGAINST MICHAEL BENNETT. BUT THE BALL IS OUT OF THERE SO QUICKLY, HE KNEW PRESNAP ALL HE WAS GOING TO DO WAS LOOK OFF THE SAFETY. IT WAS SO EASY TO READ THE COVERAGE. AND THE ONE THING ABOUT THE SEAHAWKS IS, THEY DON'T CHANGE. THEY NEVER CHANGE. YOU KNOW WHICH COVERAGE THEY'RE IN, AND I DON'T THINK THEY CARE. &gt;&gt; ROBERT TURBIN NOW IN THE GAME. WILSON. HE'S GONNA GIVE IT TO TURBIN. AND TURBIN'S GONNA GET FREE AND TAKE IT OUT TO THE 39. IT'S A 19YARD GAIN. SEATTLE WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE. MEANWHILE, BACK TO THE LAST DRIVE, CRIS, HOW BIG WAS THE JUMPING OFFSIDE OF CLIFF AVRIL? THAT WAS A THIRD DOWN AND 3 AT THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP ANYWAY? POSSIBLY. BUT ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS MAKE ANYTHING TOO EASY ON TOM BRADY. &gt;&gt; SO, TOM BRADY, 20 OF 27 AFTER THE WACKIEST TWO WEEKS OF HIS CAREER. 37. WE ALL KNOW THE STORY. DRAFTED IN THE SIXTH ROUND. HE WAS THE 199th PICK. GOT A CHANCE TO START IN 2001 WHEN DREW BLEDSOE GOT HURT IN A GAME AGAINST THE JETS. THAT WAS BELICHICK'S SECOND YEAR. AND THE REST IS HISTORY. AND HE'S WRITTEN MOST OF IT. 24 SECONDS. FROM THE 39 NOW. WILSON. GETTING AWAY. AND WILSON IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 45YARD LINE. SO NOW YOU HAVE 17 SECONDS. HAUSCHKA IS THEIR FIELDGOAL KICKER. GOOD RANGE, BUT HAUSCHKA DID MISS THREE FIELD GOALS IN THIS STADIUM AGAINST ARIZONA IN DECEMBER. &gt;&gt; JAMIE COLLINS, ONE OF THE MOST ATHLETIC DEFENDERS THE PATRIOTS HAVE, COULD NOT GET A HAND ON RUSSELL WILSON. AND THE SAD PART ABOUT IT IS, ALL THE PATRIOTS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WEEK, IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF THE HALF OR THE GAME, OR IN BIG MOMENTS, BELIEVE ME, RUSSELL WILSON'S GONNA PULL THE BALL DOWN AND RUN WITH IT, AND THEY STILL LET HIM GET OUT. &gt;&gt; 17 SECONDS. THEY NEED ABOUT 10 YARDS OR SO AND EITHER A TIMEOUT OR OUT OF BOUNDS. WILSON. ROLLING AWAY. AND THEN HE HAS TO THROW IT AWAY. SO NOW YOU GET DOWN TO THE MATH. YOU GOT 11 SECONDS. YOU CAN STILL USE ALL OF THE FIELD BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TIMEOUTS. HAUSCHKA'S HAD A GOOD YEAR, BUT HAUSCHKA, AS I SAID WE DID A SUNDAYNIGHT GAME HERE IN DECEMBER, AND HE MISSED THREE FIELD GOALS. &gt;&gt; AND ONLY MISSED SIX ALL YEAR. YOU JUST WONDER GOLF, RIGHT? THERE'S A FEW HOLES, YOU STAND THERE ON THE TEE, AND YOU GO, "I'M NOT FEELING TOO GOOD ABOUT THIS ONE." WONDER IF IT HAPPENS TO FIELDGOAL KICKERS, TOO. &gt;&gt; HAPPENED RIGHT HERE TO TIGER WOODS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, DIDN'T IT? &gt;&gt; SURE DID. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 NOW. WILSON. THROWING. AND THAT WILL BE CAUGHT. AND THAT WILL SET THEM UP FOR A FIELD GOAL. BUT A FLAG HERE. RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKES THE CATCH. BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A FLAG IN THE SECONDARY. IF IT'S HOLDING AGAINST THE DEFENSE, THEY'LL DECLINE THAT, PUT THEM INTO FIELDGOAL RANGE. 6 SECONDS. YOU HAD &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL, FACE MASK. DEFENSE, NUMBER 25. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ADDED ONTO THE END OF THE RUN, HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S AT THE END OF THE RUN. IT GETS TACKED ON. SO, IF YOU'RE THE SEAHAWKS, DO YOU DARE? I MEAN, YOU HAVE 6 SECONDS. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN AFFORD IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, PARTNER? TO GO FOR IT? &gt;&gt; I THINK YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THESE 3 POINTS OUT OF HERE. BUT IT'S INTERESTING, AL, THAT YOU'VE GOT WE TALKED ABOUT THESE RECEIVERS. IT HAS BEEN BASICALLY THE BACKUPS, RICARDO LOCKETTE AND CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO HAVE MADE THE PLAYS HERE IN THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; SO THE FIELDGOAL UNIT CAME OUT. NOW THE OFFENSE COMES OUT. NOW THEY CALL A TIMEOUT. SO, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT TO RUN A PLAY IN 6 SECONDS? AND THEN YOU RUN THE RISK OF NOTHING LEFT ON THE CLOCK. AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE BALL SEATTLE WILL TO START THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; WELL, AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, AS WELL THE PATRIOTS AREN'T A BUNCH OF DUMMIES. SO YOU'RE OVER THERE WITH 6 SECONDS. THEY KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO. YOU EITHER GOT TO THROW A SLANT YOU GOT TO THROW SOMETHING WHERE YOU CATCH IT AND THROW IT. SO NOW DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE AGAINST BILL BELICHICK AND MATT PATRICIA'S DEFENSE, OF SORT OF TIPPING YOUR HAND AS TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THIS SITUATION? THEY'RE GONNA TRY IT. &gt;&gt; VERY RISKY. VERY FASCINATING. &gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN'T TAKE A SACK. CAN'T SCRAMBLE AROUND. IT'S GOT TO BE A CATCH AND THROW, AND I'M GONNA GUESS RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN TOLD, "UNLESS IT IS PERFECT, THROW IT AWAY." &gt;&gt; THIS IS LIKE THE NBA CATCHANDSHOOT TIME. GET IT, AND GET RID OF IT. SO PETE CARROLL GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. 6 SECONDS. THAT'S THE KEY HERE. WILSON. LINING UP IN THE SHOTGUN. AND NOW NEW ENGLAND IS GOING TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; SO THEY TOOK A LOOK AT THAT SET. AND NOW WILSON WILL COME OVER AND DISCUSS THINGS WITH THE GUYS ON THE SIDELINE. LITTLE RECAP OF THE GAME. JEREMY LANE WITH THAT BIG INTERCEPTION TO STYMIE THE DRIVE, BUT THEN HE GOT HURT. CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO DIDN'T CATCH A PASS ALL SEASON, A 44YARD RECEPTION, SETTING UP A LYNCH SCORE. THEN GRONKOWSKI BEATS K.J. WRIGHT, HAULS IT IN FROM BRADY. AND WE GET TO 147 IN THAT MANNER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE A SHOT HERE, YOU WOULD THINK MAYBE CHRIS MATTHEWS. HERE'S A GUY THAT'S 6'5", 218 POUNDS, REDZONE THREAT. THROW IT UP, GIVE HIM A CHANCE GOING AGAINST ONE OF THESE SMALLER CORNERS. &gt;&gt; WE'LL SEE. YOU GOT LOCKETTE AND KEARSE GOING TO THE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S MATTHEWS AT THE BOTTOM. &gt;&gt; MATTHEWS OUTSIDE. BALDWIN IN THE SLOT. HE'S GOT TO GET RID OF IT IN A HURRY. AND HE DOES. AND IT'S CAUGHT! TOUCHDOWN! CHRIS MATTHEWS. HOW CRAZY. ANOTHER ONE OF THE SEATTLE FREE AGENTS. YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE RECOVERS THE ONSIDE KICK AGAINST GREEN BAY. TONIGHT, A 44YARD RECEPTION, AND HERE A TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION. WHAT A GUTSY CALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND YOU GO, OKAY, CHRIS MATTHEWS IS THE FOURTH RECEIVER, AND LOGAN RYAN IS YOUR FOURTH CORNER. BUT THE SIZE DIFFERENTIAL ALONE AT THAT MOMENT SAID MAYBE CHRIS MATTHEWS SHOULD BE THE NUMBERONE GUY THAT WE COVER HERE. WHAT A GREAT CALL THERE BY PETE CARROLL. &gt;&gt; EXTRA POINT IS GOOD. SO INSTEAD OF IT BEING 1410, OR 147, EACH TEAM WITH A TOUCHDOWN IN THE FINAL 2:14. AND WE'RE KNOTTED AT 14. &gt;&gt; ALL RUSSELL WILSON HAD TIME TO DO WAS CATCH IT AND THROW IT. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT IF HE HAD TRIED TO THROW A FADE INTO THE BACK OF THE END ZONE THAT THE CLOCK WOULDN'T HAVE EXPIRED. INSTEAD, WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY THROW A BULLET, BACKSHOULDER PLAY, AS LOGAN RYAN BACKED INTO THE END ZONE. AND TOM BRADY, THE WRY SMILE. WELL, IT IS WHAT WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE. ONE OF THESE KIND OF GAMES. TWO GREAT COACHES, GUTSY CALLS. WOW. &gt;&gt; BOTH OF THESE TEAMS, THEY HAVE THEIR SUPERSTARS, BUT THEY JUST ADD THESE GUYS. THEY COME OUT OF NOWHERE. YOU DON'T HEAR VERY MUCH ABOUT THEM. NEW ENGLAND'S DONE THIS FOR YEARS, AND SEATTLE WITH PETE CARROLL AND THEIR GREAT G.M., JOHN SCHNEIDER, PEOPLE SAY, "HOW CAN YOU DRAFT RUSSELL WILSON IN THE THIRD ROUND?" WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED OUT. PICKS UP GUYS LIKE CHRIS MATTHEWS. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC ROLES, RIGHT? CHRIS MATTHEWS, ONE OF THOSE GUYS, A BIG RECEIVER. "I BET YOU HE'D BE GOOD DOWN IN THE RED ZONE. LET'S SEE IF HE CAN MAKE A PLAY." LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; AND A BOUNCING BALL WILL BE FIELDED AT THE 31YARD LINE. AND THAT'S DEVELIN WHO TAKES A KNEE. AND THAT WILL TAKE US TO HALFTIME, WITH A LOT COMING UP AT THE HALF. SEATTLE'S GOING TO GET THE SECONDHALF KICKOFF. WHAT A DRIVE THERE. 80 YARDS, FIVE PLAYS. THEY RAN IT TWICE, THREW IT THREE TIMES. IT TOOK 29 SECONDS FOR THE SEAHAWKS. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE TOUCHDOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; JUST A BULLET THROW, BACK SHOULDER. KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH IT GET IT UP HIGH TO THE 6'5" CHRIS MATTHEWS. NO CHANCE FOR LOGAN RYAN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT, SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. &gt;&gt; THERE HE WAS. GREAT FIRST HALF, THOUGH. &gt;&gt; GOSTKOWSKI'S KICKOFF GOES THROUGH THE END ZONE. SEATTLE WILL TAKE OVER AT THE 20. AND WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; I JUST SPOKE WITH PETE CARROLL, WHO SAID, AFTER THE INJURY TO JEREMY LANE, THEY WILL NOT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THAT SECONDARY. HE'S HAPPY WITH THE PLAYERS THEY'VE GOT. HE JUST SAID, "WE GOT TO GO BEAT THE...OUT OF SOME OTHER PLAYERS AND DO WHAT WE CAME HERE TO DO." AS FOR BILL BELICHICK, HE SAID, "THIS GAME IS NO MYSTERY. IT'S A PLAYERS' GAME. WHICHEVER PLAYERS PLAY BEST IN THE SECOND HALF WILL BE CHAMPIONS, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE." &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MICHELE. GREAT CHESS MATCH. TWO GUYS WHO HAVE ONLY FACED EACH OTHER TWICE BEFORE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THESE TWO GUYS FACED EACH OTHER IN 1994. BELICHICK, THE HEAD COACH OF CLEVELAND. PETE CARROLL IN HIS ONE YEAR WITH THE NEW YORK JETS. AND OFF WE GO IN THE SECOND HALF. STARTING WITH LYNCH. THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB BOTTLING HIM UP TONIGHT. HE GOES TO THE 23YARD LINE. HIS 13th CARRY BUT ONLY FOR 48 YARDS. THE BUZZ BRADY, HIS NUMBERS. 11 CAREER SUPER BOWL T.D. PASSES, INCLUDING TWO IN THE FIRST HALF. RUSSELL WILSON. TOOK HIM A LONG TIME TO GET STARTED. DIDN'T HAVE A COMPLETION UNTIL THERE WERE ABOUT 5 1/2 MINUTES LEFT IN THE HALF. THREW THAT T.D. PASS AT THE END. CHRIS MATTHEWS DIDN'T MAKE A SINGLE CATCH THIS YEAR OR IN HIS CAREER. FOURTH PLAYER TO MAKE HIS FIRST CATCH EVER IN THE SUPER BOWL. THIRD SUPER BOWL GAME OF THE 49 TIED AT THE HALF. LYNCH IN THE BACKFIELD. GIVE IT TO HIM. MARSHAWN LYNCH OFF AND RUNNING. HIS BIGGEST CARRY OF THE NIGHT. HIS BIGGEST GAIN. OUT TO THE 38YARD LINE FOR A FIRST DOWN. CARROLL HAPPY ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL. YOU'RE TRYING TO STEP UP HERE AND COME AROUND HERE, AND YOU JUST CREATE A LANE. IF YOU GET THE FIRST LINEBACKER BLOCKED, WHICH J.R. SWEEZY DOES, NOW YOU GET THAT BIG GUY IN THE SECONDARY, AND LOOK OUT. THE PATRIOTS KNEW THAT TO START THIS SECOND HALF, THE SEAHAWKS ARE A TEAM THAT WANT TO COME OUT AND POUND THE FOOTBALL. SO FAR THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; AS THEY DID AGAINST GREEN BAY. NOW THEY RUN PLAYACTION. WILSON GOING DEEP. AND IT'S CAUGHT AGAIN! CHRIS MATTHEWS! CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON? THIS IS A GUY WORKING IN A FOOT LOCKER STORE WHEN THE SEAHAWKS CALLED HIM, SAID, "COME ON AND TRY OUT." HE HAD TO TELL HIS BOSS, "LET ME GET OUT OF WORK EARLY. I HAVE TO FLY UP TO SEATTLE." &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY ONE THING FOR CHRIS MATTHEWS HE KNOWS HOW TO SUBTLY WORK IT. A LITTLE NUDGE IN THE BACK RIGHT THERE AGAINST KYLE ARRINGTON, BUT ENOUGH FOR HIM JUST A LITTLE GOT ARRINGTON GOING FORWARD. AND HIS SIZE IS THE DIFFERENCE. LOOK AT THE HEIGHT THAT RUSSELL WILSON PUTS ON THAT BALL. PERFECT. WE SAW HIM MAKE SO MANY THROWS LIKE THAT IN PRACTICE. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 17. NOW IT'S LYNCH. TYPICAL LYNCH RIGHT HERE. MOVING THE PILE FORWARD. TAKING IT TO THE 10YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AL, THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SEATTLE'S OFFENSIVE LINE. THEY LOVE MARSHAWN LYNCH. AND AT THE END OF PLAYS, SO MANY TIMES YOU'LL SEE THE OFFENSIVE LINEMEN COME DOWN THE FIELD AND SORT OF GET ON HIS BACK AND START TO PUSH HIM, ALMOST LIKE A RUGBY SCRUM OF SOME KIND, AND JUST PUSH HIM RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. BUT IF THAT GUY GETS GOING, EVERYTHING STARTS TO WORK THE READ OPTION, THE BOOTLEG GAME, ALL THAT STARTS TO WORK FOR THIS OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; LYNCH OUT, TURBIN IN. BALDWIN IN MOTION. FAKE IT TO HIM. GIVE IT TO TURBIN. AND HE'LL GET WRESTLED DOWN A YARD SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. SPOT THE BALL AT THE 8YARD LINE. THIRD AND 1. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S HAVING A REALLY NICE GAME SO FAR IS J.R. SWEEZY. WE HAVE SEEN HIM RIGHT ON SOME BIG BLOCKS. HE'S HAD TO TAKE ON VINCE WILFORK MOST OF THE NIGHT. A VERY SOLID RUN BLOCKER ALL SEASON LONG. AND THIS FORMER DEFENSIVE LINEMAN IS COMING OUT HERE A LITTLE ANGRY TO START THIS SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; GOT A STACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, INCLUDING MATTHEWS THERE. YOU GOT LYNCH BACK IN THE GAME. IT'S THIRD DOWN AND 1. AND LYNCH IS GONNA GET STOPPED. AND THAT IS ROB NINKOVICH. HE COULDN'T GET BY NINKOVICH THERE. AND THAT'S GONNA SET UP FOURTH DOWN, AND HERE COMES THE FIELDGOAL GROUP. &gt;&gt; RIGHT OFF THE EDGE. NOBODY BLOCKED HIM. COME RIGHT DOWN THE LINE HERE, AND THAT'S JUST A VETERAN PLAYER UNDERSTANDING THE SITUATION. GONNA GIVE THE BALL TO MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE JUST BEATS THEM TO THE PUNCH. &gt;&gt; THAT SETS UP A 27YARD FIELDGOAL ATTEMPT FOR STEVEN HAUSCHKA. 2 FOR 2 AT THE MEADOWLANDS LAST YEAR. AND THAT GIVES THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS THEIR FIRST LEAD OF THE NIGHT. BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT. ROOF OPEN. GOOD GAME. 1714. BELICHICK WORKING WITH HIS DEFENSE ON THE SIDELINE, AND TOM BRADY READY TO GET THE BALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; THINK YOU ONLY HAVE TO SAY ONE THING "SOMEBODY GO COVER CHRIS MATTHEWS." &gt;&gt; AMAZING. HAUSCHKA'S KICK. RESULTS IN A TOUCHBACK. DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER. BILL BELICHICK TOOK OVER IN 2000. BRADY TOOK OVER AS THE STARTER IN '01. MOST NFL TITLE GAMES, HEAD COACH/QUARTERBACK DUO GO BACK TO OTTO GRAHAM AND PAUL BROWN. VINCE LOMBARDI, OF COURSE, AND BART STARR FOUR NFL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AND SUPER BOWLS I AND II. AND BRADY AND BELICHICK. PLAYING IN THEIR SIXTH SUPER BOWL. ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY CLOSE. THE PREVIOUS FIVE HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY 4 POINTS OR FEWER. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A 3POINT GAME. EARLY THIRD QUARTER. BRADY. QUICKLY TO THE OUTSIDE. AND TAKEN DOWN IS EDELMAN AFTER A GAIN OF A COUPLE. KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT THERE. SECOND DOWN AND 8. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. KAM CHANCELLOR RIGHT OVER HERE, WHO HAS BEEN SORT OF THE UNDERNEATH COVERAGE GUY, AND THEY'RE TRYING TO JUST ISOLATE THOSE BIG GUYS. EDELMAN HAS BEEN THE QUICKNESS. SHANE VEREEN HAS BEEN THE QUICKNESS. AND SO FAR EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE, AND YET THEY LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD AND IT'S 1714, SEATTLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GRONKOWSKI. SETS UP ON THE LEFT SIDE. PROVIDING LEVERAGE HERE. BLOUNT. CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. McDANIEL IS THERE TO STOP HIM. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 6 FOR NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND NOW COMES THE SITUATION. IT'S BIG IF YOU CAN GET THEM BACK THIRD AND 6 AND KEEP THEM OUT OF THOSE THIRD AND 2s AND 3s, BECAUSE NOW YOUR PASS RUSH HAS A CHANCE. BUT SO FAR, IT HAS BEEN TOM BRADY'S ABILITY TO GET RID OF THE FOOTBALL BEFORE THAT PASS RUSH CAN GET THERE THAT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO MOVE THE BALL UP AND DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THREE RECEIVERS SET TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND ONE LaFELL UP ON THE LEFT SIDE ON THIRD AND 6. SHOWING BLITZ. HERE THEY COME. BRADY GETS KNOCKED DOWN BUT GETS THE PASS AWAY. AND GRONKOWSKI HAS THE FIRST DOWN. SO BRADY GETS TAKEN TO THE GRASS BUT GETS IT AWAY AND CONVERTS. &gt;&gt; IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. MICHAEL BENNETT COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO TOM BRADY ANY FASTER THAN THIS. RIGHT AROUND, RIGHT IN ON HIM. AND HE STILL DOESN'T GET THE PRESSURE THAT HE NEEDS. GRONKOWSKI ON THE OUTSIDE. WE'VE SEEN IT ALREADY. IF THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY MAN COVERAGE, SEATTLE'S GOING TO LOSE THOSE BATTLES KAM CHANCELLOR, K.J. WRIGHT. THIS GUY IS JUST TOO GOOD. UNANIMOUS ALLPRO. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER SET HERE WITH THE GUY LINED UP ON THE END AT THE RIGHT CAMERON FLEMING IS ELIGIBLE. THEY RUN IN THAT DIRECTION, WITH THE UNBALANCED LINE, AND BLOUNT PICKS UP A YARD. CHANCELLOR COMING UP TO STUFF HIM. SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; AL, DON'T YOU GET THE FEELING THAT THE PATRIOTS HAVE TO BE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED? I THINK THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A BETTER DAY RUNNING THE FOOTBALL. THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING THAT EXTRA OFFENSIVE LINEMAN/TIGHT END IN, IN CAMERON FLEMING, AND THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH IT. SO IT'S ALL TOM BRADY. &gt;&gt; DEFINITELY. HAD THAT ONE DRIVE STYMIED ON THE INTERCEPTION, AND THEN TO GET BEAT BY A GUY NAMED CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S NOT CAUGHT A PASS? AND THEN TO GIVE UP THE 5PLAY, 29YARD OR 29SECOND DRIVE AT THE END OF THE FIRST HALF. BRANDON BOLDEN IS NOW THE RUNNING BACK. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. FAKE TO HIM. AND THEN THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. BRADY TOSSING IT OVER THE MIDDLE, PRESSURE PUT ON BY BENNETT. WAS ANYBODY IN THE AREA? &gt;&gt; HE WAS DEFINITELY UNDER PRESSURE AGAIN. MICHAEL BENNETT. HERE WE GO. RIGHT DOWN INSIDE. AND HE'S GOING TO GET THERE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; COULD THIS BE GROUNDING? LOOK AT THIS HERE. OKAY, PRESSURE. WHO IS HE THROWING IT TO? &gt;&gt; WELL, I... THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; HELLO? THIRD DOWN AND 9. PLAY CLOCK AT :01. BRADY. OVER THE MIDDLE. AND IT'S PICKED OFF AT THE 42YARD LINE BY BOBBY WAGNER! SECOND INTERCEPTION. BOBBY WAGNER, OVER THE MIDDLE. THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY. THE FLAG IS UP TO THE 41YARD LINE. AVRIL IS DOWN. LANE HAD THE EARLY INTERCEPTION, AND HE GOT HURT AND IS OUT FOR THE GAME. YOU'VE GOT AVRIL DOWN. YOU GOT A PENALTY FLAG DOWNFIELD. AND VINOVICH WILL LET US KNOW. IN THE MEANTIME, BRADY'S ALREADY WALKING OFF THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. WATCH WAGNER. AS THIS COMES ACROSS, HE GOES THAT WAY AND COMES BACK. BRADY THOUGHT THAT HE HAD CLEARED WAGNER WHEN GRONKOWSKI SETTLED DOWN. WAGNER, ATHLETIC ENOUGH TO JUMP BACK UNDERNEATH IT FOR THE HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; AND THE PENALTY IS AFTER &gt;&gt; AFTER THE INTERCEPTION, DURING THE RETURN, ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK. INTERCEPTING TEAM, NUMBER 25. 10YARD PENALTY FROM THE SPOT OF THE FOUL. SEATTLE KEEPS THE BALL. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PICK. THE PENALTY IS ON RICHARD SHERMAN FOR THE ILLEGAL BLOCK IN THE BACK. SO THAT MOVES THE BALL BACK TO THE MIDFIELD STRIPE. RIGHT ON THE 50YARD LINE. WITH 8:07 LEFT IN THE THIRD. AND THERE'S SHERMAN AND WAGNER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, AL? SOMETIMES, EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T GET THE SACKS, IF YOU GET THE HITS, IT ACCELERATES THE PROCESS IN THE QUARTERBACK'S MIND. AND I THINK THAT THEY HURRIED THE CLOCK OF TOM BRADY ON THAT THROW. BOBBY WAGNER, WHAT A DIFFERENCE WHEN HE CAME BACK IN THE LINEUP, RIGHT? UNDER 10 POINTS A GAME. &gt;&gt; MISSED FIVE GAMES TURF TOE. PICKED IN THAT SAME DRAFT, JUST AHEAD OF RUSSELL WILSON IN 2012. NOW WILSON SLINGS ONE TO THE LEFT SIDE. MATTHEWS AGAIN. THIS IS JUST AMAZING. 41YARD LINE. HE PLAYED IN THE CFL FOR TWO YEARS. WAS THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN THE CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE BACK IN 2012. &gt;&gt; BRANDON BROWNER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST, BADDEST CORNERS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. AND MATTHEWS THAT TIME JUST THREW HIM OFF. I MEAN, THESE ARE TWO HUGE MEN GOING AT IT ON THE OUTSIDE. I THINK THEY MAKE THE SWITCH BECAUSE BROWNER HAS MORE SIZE. HE CAN JUMP UP AND HANDLE THOSE JUMP BALLS. BUT NOW CAN HE HANDLE HIS QUICKNESS? &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 1 FROM THE 41. AND LYNCH... TO MOVE THE STICKS. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT CHRIS MATTHEWS. DARRELL BEVELL, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR NICKNAMED HIM "HARDBALL" FOR CHRIS MATTHEWS OF MSNBC, WHO IS HERE AT THE GAME TODAY. AND THIS CHRIS MATTHEWS THE SEAHAWKS' CHRIS MATTHEWS SAID, "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. EVERY TIME I WIKIPEDIA MYSELF, IT KEEPS COMING UP THE OTHER GUY." TOMORROW HE MAY SUPPLANT MSNBC's CHRIS MATTHEWS IN THE NUMBERONE SPOT. &gt;&gt; JUST JUMP RIGHT OVER. HE MAY BE THERE RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING. YOU AND I ARE SO HIP. BUT I WOULD SAY HE'S TRENDING RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION. FROM THE 38YARD LINE. OFF THE PISTOL FORMATION. WILSON HAS TIME. LOOK HOW ELUSIVE HE IS. THERE'S A FLAG DOWN, HOWEVER. THERE IT IS. YOU SAW IT AT THE 31YARD LINE. AND WILSON WILL SLIDE TO A STOP AT THE 21, AND WE'LL GET THE CALL FROM VINOVICH. &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT GET A HAND ON RUSSELL WILSON. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. DEFENSE, NUMBER 39. 5YARD PENALTY FROM THE END OF THE RUN. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BRANDON BROWNER. THAT'S NOTHING NEW, BECAUSE HE DRAWS A TON OF PENALTIES. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HILARIOUS. CHANDLER JONES LOOK AT THIS. DEAD TO RIGHTS, RIGHT? CAN'T EVEN GET A FINGER ON RUSSELL WILSON. WILSON SAW IT COMING THE WHOLE TIME. HE JUST VERY CASUALLY LOOKED LIKE HE WAS LOOKING DOWNFIELD, BUT SAW HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. THEN THAT LITTLE MOVE OF HIS, AND TAKES OFF. THIS GUY IS SOMETHING SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; BROWNER, 39. THERE'S THE PENALTY. HOLDING ON TO KEARSE. AND SHOVING HIM. SETTING UP A FIRST DOWN AT THE 18YARD LINE. LYNCH. STILL GOING. TO THE 4. HE'S JUST A RUNAWAY TRUCK. TACKLED BY NINKOVICH. &gt;&gt; WATCH THE MOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOLE. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS RUN I THINK THAT'S JAMIE COLLINS THAT CAME DOWN THERE HE IS AL, YOU DESCRIBED HIM EARLIER AS A SPLITFOOTED RUNNER. HE RUNS WITH HIS FEET SO FAR APART, IT ALLOWS HIM TO MAKE THESE LATERAL CUTS, AND PEOPLE REALLY GOOD TACKLERS CAN'T GET THEIR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND HIM. &gt;&gt; TUKUAFU'S THE FULLBACK. FROM THE 4. GIVE IT TO MARSHAWN. TO THE 3YARD LINE HE GOES. GAIN OF 1. SECOND AND GOAL. THE HAWKS' LAST FOUR DRIVES HAVE BEEN TOUCHDOWN, FIELD GOAL, TOUCHDOWN, AND IN PROGRESS RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S WHERE YOU REALLY FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KIND OF GOT TO JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER, RIGHT? OKAY, YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE TO START THE FIRST HALF, YOU MAKE A BIG MISTAKE HERE IN THE SECOND HALF. BUT THESE TWO TEAMS HAVE PLAYED FROM BEHIND DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THESE PLAYOFFS. NO BIG DEAL. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND GOAL. PLAY FAKE. LITTLE LOB. WIDE OPEN! TOUCHDOWN, DOUG BALDWIN! AFTER THE WAGNER INTERCEPTION, SIX PLAYS, 50 YARDS. FLAG WENT DOWN. THERE WILL BE A CELEBRATION PENALTY, WHICH WILL BE ASSESSED ON THE KICKOFF. &gt;&gt; PLAYACTION TO GET THE RUN GAME GOING. BUT LET'S GIVE CREDIT TO DOUG BALDWIN. A VETERAN PLAYER. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN, UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. OFFENSE, NUMBER 89. 15YARD PENALTY ON THE KICKOFF. TOUCHDOWN IS GOOD. &gt;&gt; VETERAN RECEIVER KNOWS HOW TO USE THE UMPIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIELD TO PICK OFF THE MAN COVERAGE. HE DID IT PERFECTLY. BRILLIANT PLAY BY DOUG BALDWIN. &gt;&gt; DOUG BALDWIN. HIS FIRST CATCH. PLAYED AT STANFORD. THERE'S A GUY WHO HIT THE MOTHER LODE. HOW ABOUT CATCHING PASSES FROM ANDREW LUCK IN COLLEGE AND RUSSELL WILSON AS A PRO? HAUSCHKA FOR THE EXTRA POINT. CASH IN TOUCHDOWN AFTER THE TURNOVER. &gt;&gt; WE SAW RICHARD SHERMAN GOING, "24, 24." HERE'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING. WHO IS THE BEST CORNERBACK IN ALL OF FOOTBALL? WELL, PART OF THE DEBATE, DARRELLE REVIS, 24, JUST GOT BEAT. "24. THAT MAKES ME NUMBER ONE." [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE'S BETTER THAN HALF THE LOUNGE ACTS IN VEGAS. HE'S TAKEN INTERVIEW SESSIONS TO PERFORMANCE ART. WHAT A CHARACTER. AND ONE HECK OF A PLAYER, BY THE WAY. AFTER THE PENALTY, THE KICKOFF FROM 15 YARDS FARTHER BACK. AND DANNY AMENDOLA RUNS IT BACK OUT TO THE 37. PETE CARROLL TOOK OVER IN 2010. HEAD COACH FACING HIS SUCCESSOR AND FORMER TEAM GO BACK TO SUPER BOWL III, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GAMES IN THE HISTORY OF THE NFL. WEEB EWBANK BEAT DON SHULA. THAT'S THE JOE NAMATH GAME. YOU GO BACK TO 2002 JON GRUDEN HAD LEFT OAKLAND FOR SOME DRAFT CHOICES, BILL CALLAHAN TOOK OVER, AND GRUDEN WON A SUPER BOWL WITH THE TEAM THAT TONY DUNGY HAD LEFT AT THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; AND PETE CARROLL ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE GUYS IN ALL OF FOOTBALL. WHEN WE ASKED HIM ABOUT IT, HE SAID, "WHEN I GOT FIRED, I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZED WHAT THEY WERE LOSING." MAY PROVE PROPHETIC HERE IF THIS SCORE HOLDS. &gt;&gt; THREE YEARS THERE, THEN ON TO S.C. AND FIVE YEARS NOW THERE. AND BRADY THROWS. AND THAT PASS IS CAUGHT. EDELMAN. FLAG IS DOWN. COULD BE A HOLD. AT THE 48YARD LINE. VINOVICH WILL MAKE THE CALL RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. OFFENSE, NUMBER 66. &gt;&gt; COMING BACK. &gt;&gt; 10YARD PENALTY. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; BRYAN STORK. THAT'S THE CENTER. &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN'T BLOCK THIS GUY. MICHAEL BENNETT IS SIMPLY TAKING OVER THE FOOTBALL GAME. BRYAN STORK, A ROOKIE IN THERE, VOTED THE RIMINGTON AWARD, BEST CENTER IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. NOBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO BLOCK MICHAEL BENNETT ALL NIGHT. &gt;&gt; TALKING TO PETE CARROLL THE OTHER DAY, FIRED BY THE JETS, FIRED BY THE PATRIOTS. SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE DICEY BRINGING IT UP, BUT HE SAID, "MY THERAPIST TELLS ME TO TALK ABOUT IT." [ BOTH LAUGH ] FIRST AND 20 FROM THE 25YARD LINE. BRADY GOING DEEP DOWN THE LEFT SIDELINE. AND THROWS THAT ONE ON THE CHALK. INTENDED FOR LaFELL. WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; SEATTLE STARTING DEFENSIVE END CLIFF AVRIL TOOK A HEAVY HIT. HE HAS GONE TO THE LOCKER ROOM FOR A CONCUSSION EVALUATION. QUESTIONABLE WITH A HEAD INJURY. HE WAS ESCORTED OFF THE FIELD AND TO THE LOCKER ROOM BY THE TEAM INTERNIST AS WELL AS THE LEAGUE'S UNAFFILIATED NEUROTRAUMA CONSULTANT, SO ON HIS WAY TO THAT CONCUSSION PROTOCOL, AL. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, MICHELE. THAT MEANS O'BRIEN SCHOFIELD, WHO WEARS NUMBER 93, COMES IN TO TAKE OVER THAT SPOT. THERE HE IS. FIFTHYEAR GUY OUT OF WISCONSIN. PLAYED HERE WITH THE CARDINALS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. SECOND DOWN AND 20. AND BRADY WILL DUMP IT OFF UNDERNEATH. EDELMAN LOOKING FOR ROOM. PICKS UP ABOUT 6 EXTRA YARDS AFTER HE WAS INITIALLY STOPPED. GETS THE BALL OUT TO THE 36YARD LINE. IT WILL BE THIRD DOWN AND 9 FOR THE PATS. &gt;&gt; WELL, HERE WE GO. DOWN THE FIELD. BRANDON LaFELL AND RICHARD SHERMAN. OBVIOUSLY LaFELL NOT EVEN REALLY LOOKING FOR A PASS. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE UNDERPLAYS WHERE HE KNOWS ALL ALONG HIS JOB IS TO BLOCK. &gt;&gt; KEY THIRD AND 9. AMENDOLA COMES THIS WAY AND THAT WAY. AND BRADY WILL FIRE. AND IT IS AMENDOLA WHO CAN'T MAKE THE CATCH. AMENDOLA WITH WAGNER RIGHT THERE. AND FOURTH AND 9, AND IN COMES THE PUNTING GROUP. &gt;&gt; AMENDOLA RIGHT HERE. AND THEN I THINK HE GETS A GLANCE AT BOBBY WAGNER COMING RIGHT FOR HIS CHIN STRAP. BUT THAT'S A MISS BY BRADY. JUST HAD A CHANCE THERE. LOOKED LIKE IT HIT HIM PRETTY GOOD, BUT MAYBE A LITTLE FLINCH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE WAGNER ALREADY WITH 11 TACKLES AND AN INTERCEPTION. AND THE PUNT... CANNOT BE SAVED. &gt;&gt; STRATEGY PRETTY CLEAR FOR THE PATRIOTS ON DEFENSE. WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO IS PLAY THE FOUR BIG DEFENSIVE LINEMEN UP FRONT, PUT JAMIE COLLINS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEFENSE AND LET HIM RUN SIDELINE TO SIDELINE AND MAKE PLAYS. HE'S MADE SOME PRETTY NICE PLAYS INSIDE, TRACKING DOWN MARSHAWN LYNCH. BUT IT WAS THE PLAY RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF THAT REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE. HE DID NOT GET THE PROPER LEVERAGE ON RUSSELL WILSON. WILSON'S QUICKNESS HAS BEEN A FACTOR ALL NIGHT. AND THAT ONE RIGHT THERE SET UP THAT TOUCHDOWN RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF. BIG, BIG, BIG MISTAKE. &gt;&gt; LYNCH HAS CARRIED FOR 88 YARDS. WILSON ONLY 3 CARRIES, BUT FOR 39. LOOK AT THE TIME HE HAS. AND THEN CAUGHT UP AT THE 45YARD LINE. RICARDO LOCKETTE MAKING THE GRAB. THAT'S A GAIN OF 25 YARDS. &gt;&gt; RICARDO LOCKETTE KIND OF MAKES ME LAUGH. THEY GO THE BOOTLEG PLAY OUT OF HERE. AND WATCH RUSSELL WILSON. THEY SAY HE DOESN'T READ DEFENSES? MY FOOT. HE MUST HAVE LOOKED AT FOUR DIFFERENT RECEIVERS ON THAT PLAY UNTIL HE FINALLY COMES ALL THE WAY ACROSS BACK TO THE BACK SIDE. RUSSELL WILSON IS GETTING VERY COMFORTABLE. THREE TOUCHDOWNS AND A FIELD GOAL, THE LAST FOUR DRIVES. &gt;&gt; AFTER NO YARDS, NO COMPLETIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND MOST OF THE SECOND PERIOD. LYNCH. 2 TOUGH YARDS. 2 1/2 MINUTES REMAINING IN THE THIRD. &gt;&gt; YOU WATCH A PLAYER LIKE CHANDLER JONES HAVE A FREE SHOT LIKE HE HAD ON THAT PLAY AGAINST MARSHAWN LYNCH, AND HE BARELY SLOWED HIM DOWN. YOU KNOW? AND AS YOU GET INTO THE SECOND HALF, DEFENSES AND DEFENDERS, ESPECIALLY THE BIG GUYS, GET TIRED. AND MARSHAWN LYNCH, IF YOU'RE TIRED HE'S HARD ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE FRESH. YOU'RE TIRED, IT GETS REALLY DIFFICULT. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THEY'LL KEEP HIM, WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD HIM. THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT THEY'RE READY TO MAKE A BIG LONGTERM DEAL WITH HIM GOING FORWARD. CATCH MADE ON THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S JERMAINE KEARSE. MALCOLM BUTLER MAKES THE TACKLE. KEARSE, THE BIG HERO AT THE END OF THE GAME AGAINST GREEN BAY WITH THE OVERTIME CATCH. HIS ONLY CATCH OF THAT GAME, AFTER HE'D BEEN TARGETED SIX TIMES. ALL FOUR WILSON INTERCEPTIONS WERE ON PASSES INTENDED FOR HIM. THE OTHER ONE WAS INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT A GUY THAT HAD THE GAMEWINNING TOUCHDOWN IN BACKTOBACK CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES? &gt;&gt; AMAZING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES AGAINST SAN FRANCISCO ON THAT FOURTHDOWN PLAY THE YEAR BEFORE. COMES RIGHT BACK WITH ANOTHER ONE. &gt;&gt; AND HOW ABOUT A QUARTERBACK WHO KEEPS GOING TO A GUY WHO KEEPS GETTING INTERCEPTED EVERY TIME HE'S TARGETED? THIRD AND 3. WILSON SURVEYS. AND IT IS BOBBLED AND DROPPED. THAT TIME IT'S KEARSE AGAIN. MALCOLM BUTLER, ONE OF THE EXTRA DEFENSIVE BACKS, COMES IN TO HELP BREAK IT UP. IT'LL BE FOURTH DOWN AND 3. &gt;&gt; GONNA GO HERE AND BACK AROUND. JUST A LITTLE RUB ROUTE, AND THEY GOT IT. THEY HAD THE ROOKIE, MALCOLM BUTLER. AND THAT TIME KEARSE JUST COULD NOT HOLD ON TO IT. HUGE PLAY. THAT IS IN SCORING POSITION, OR YOUR PUNTER COMES ON THE FIELD. AND HERE COMES JON RYAN. &gt;&gt; JULIAN EDELMAN SETS UP INSIDE HIS OWN 10YARD LINE. OOH, LOW SNAP. PICKS IT UP AND GETS IT AWAY. EDELMAN SAYS STAY AWAY FROM IT. AND IT BOUNDS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 11YARD LINE. 2414. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THE PATH THAT EACH OF THESE TEAMS TOOK. 22 WAS NEW ENGLAND GOING INTO WEEK 5. THEY LOST IN KANSAS CITY ON THAT MONDAY NIGHT. THE SKY'S FALLING. SEATTLE WAS 33, THEN THEY WERE 64. HAD THAT BIG MEETING THAT BEGAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AND GO FIGURE. HERE'S A TEAM DOWN 160 AGAINST THE GREEN BAY PACKERS, BUT THEIR DEFENSE HUNG IN THERE SO WELL ALL THOSE TURNOVERS IN THE FIRST HALF TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO GET TO THIS GAME. AND NOW THEIR DEFENSE AGAIN DELIVERING. AND RUSSELL WILSON, MARSHAWN LYNCH, PUTTING ON A SHOW, AS WELL. &gt;&gt; AND NEW ENGLAND KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COME FROM BEHIND. THEY WERE DOWN TWICE BY 14 IN THE DIVISIONAL ROUND TO THE RAVENS. THEY START THIS DRIVE WITH VEREEN TAKING THE BALL UP TO THE 17YARD LINE FOR A SHORT GAIN. CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE. THAT KNEE SEEMS TO BE FINE. PLAYING WITH THE BRACE TODAY. &gt;&gt; INTERESTING HERE, AL, THAT NOW WE'RE GETTING SHANE VEREEN IN THE BACKFIELD. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO POUND IT IN THERE WITH LeGARRETTE BLOUNT, AND HERE HE COMES BACK IN THE GAME NOW, BUT YOU WONDER NOW, AS A PLAY CALLER, IS JOSH McDANIELS GETTING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED? SOMETIMES VEREEN I'VE SEEN HIM COME IN AT THE END OF OTHER GAMES AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE BURST. MAYBE HE'S THINKING IT MAY BE TIME. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT BLOUNT. THEY ALSO PUT THE FULLBACK IN THERE, DEVELIN. AND BRADY, OFF PLAYACTION, THROWS. CAUGHT. IT WILL BE A GAIN CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. DEVELIN MAKES THE CATCH. HE SCORED A TOUCHDOWN IN THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. THAT'S GONNA TAKE US TO THE FOURTH QUARTER. SEAHAWKS OWNER PAUL ALLEN, G.M. JOHN SCHNEIDER. PAUL ALLEN BOUGHT THE TEAM IN '97. STARTED MICROSOFT WITH BILL GATES. LEFT THERE IN '83. MADE A TON OF MONEY, BUT HE'S BEEN A PHENOMENAL PHILANTHROPIST. MICROSOFT ALL OVER THE PLACE HERE RIGHT NOW. HE'S GIVEN AWAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, I THINK EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT DISEASES, MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITIES, AND ALL OF THE REST. BUT KIND OF AN UNDERTHERADAR GUY WHO'S NOW WATCHED HIS TEAM GET TO THREE SUPER BOWLS IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. THIRD AND 1. AL MICHAELS, CRIS COLLINSWORTH, MICHELE TAFOYA. 15 MINUTES TO GO IN REGULATION. THIRD AND 1. FROM THE 23YARD LINE. IN A 10POINT GAME. BLOUNT. GOT HIM BY THE SHIRTTAIL. CAN'T GET AWAY. TONY McDANIEL WAS ABLE TO BRING HIM BACK. AND THEY HAVE TO PUNT ON A FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM MUCH, BUT TONY McDANIEL, KEVIN WILLIAMS, RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE, THE BIG GUYS. WHEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STOP IN A THIRDAND1 SITUATION, YOU HAVE TO GET IN THE BACKFIELD TO BE ABLE TO SLOW DOWN A LeGARRETTE BLOUNT. THEY GOT THE JOB DONE THERE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE TEARAWAY JERSEYS? &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] &gt;&gt; LOW LINEDRIVE KICK. COMING UP TO FIELD IT IS WALTERS AT THE 31. AND HE GETS TACKLED AT THE 35YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; HERE WE GO. A LITTLE HARDBALL WITH CHRIS MATTHEWS. DOWN THE FIELD. THIS IS THE ONE. THIS OFFENSE WAS STUCK IN THE MUD UNTIL MATTHEWS MADE THAT PLAY. RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF, 6 SECONDS TO GO, WHO DO YOU THROW IT TO? OF COURSE, THE GUY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CATCH ALL YEAR. AND THEN DOWN THE FIELD AGAINST ARRINGTON. OH, MAYBE A LITTLE PUSHOFF. GETS AWAY WITH IT. HE HAS BEEN THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GAME. FINALLY JUMPSTARTING THAT PASSING GAME. &gt;&gt; ROD SMITH OF THE BRONCOS, MOST YARDS BY AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. MATTHEWS PLAYED THOSE TWO YEARS IN CANADA. WAS THE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR IN THE CFL. WAS WORKING IN A SPORTINGGOODS STORE, SELLING SHOES, WHEN SEATTLE CALLED AND SAID, "GET UP HERE FOR A TRYOUT." &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS UP. FROM THE 36YARD LINE. THAT'S WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT SPORTS. GAIN OF 3 FOR MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; NOW I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME RUN BLITZES HERE OUT OF THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. HERE COMES JAMIE COLLINS. THIS IS NOT EXPECTING A PASS. THAT IS SO THEY CAN CLOG UP THE MIDDLE AGAINST MARSHAWN LYNCH AND CREATE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OTHER LINEBACKER THERE, DONT'A HIGHTOWER, TO COME OVER AND HELP MAKE THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 8. LITTLE OVER A MINUTE INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER. LYNCH. OH, HE GETS POPPED. BRANCH IS RIGHT THERE, FORMER SEAHAWK, TO MAKE SURE HE GOES NOWHERE. THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; BIG OLD VINCE WILFORK. YOU RUN IN THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK. JUST GONNA MAKE A PLAY. LOOK AT TRYING TO BLOCK THAT GUY. J.R. SWEEZY'S HAD A NICE GAME, BUT ANYTIME YOU SEE VINCE WILFORK CONTACT, ARMS FULLY EXTENDED. THAT MEANS HE'S TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL IN THERE. THEN JUST STYMIED MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; WILFORK AND BRADY, THE TWO REMAINING GUYS FROM THEIR LAST SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM IN 2004. THIRD AND 7. WILSON WITH A TON OF TIME. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE THROUGH THE MIDDLE COMES ROB NINKOVICH. FOUND THE CREASE, GETS IN THERE. BIG SACK. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO NINKOVICH. HE'S 31 TODAY. &gt;&gt; COVERAGE SACK HERE. DARRELLE REVIS ON THE INSIDE ON DOUG BALDWIN. MAYBE A CHANCE THERE, BUT THAT PRESSURE REALLY TOOK A LONG TIME TO MATERIALIZE. YOU JUST WONDER IF RUSSELL WILSON WAS PROBABLY LOOKING ON THE OUTSIDE THERE. THEN NINKOVICH, THE OLD VETERAN. EIGHT SACKS ON THE YEAR FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR, AND NOW THE PATRIOTS HAVE GOT TO GET SOMETHING GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE SIDE. &gt;&gt; THREE SACKS FOR THE PATS. RYAN'S KICK. COLLECTED AT THE 18. EDELMAN. GOOD RUNBACK OUT TO THE 33YARD LINE. THE TWO T.D.s, TYING HIM WITH MONTANA ALL TIME WITH 11. TWO INTERCEPTIONS. AND WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO SERIOUS CRUNCH TIME. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND FOR TOM BRADY, IT HAS BEEN A WEEK OF DISTRACTIONS. HE'S HAD GOOD MOMENTS IN THIS GAME. HE'S MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES. I'M SURE IT'S BEEN TOUGH TO FOCUS THIS WEEK. &gt;&gt; TWO FULL WEEKS. HE STARTS FROM THE 32. AND HE'S GOING TO GET SACKED. EVERYBODY COVERED. AND BRUCE IRVIN COMES IN TO KNOCK HIM DOWN. &gt;&gt; COVERAGE ALL OVER THE FIELD. RICHARD SHERMAN, WHO GAVE UP THE FIRST PASS OF THE GAME, AND THAT HAS BEEN IT. GRONKOWSKI, WHEN HE ENDED UP IN ONEONONE COVERAGE AGAINST K.J. WRIGHT, HAD A PLAY. BUT JUST NOWHERE TO THROW THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; 8YARD SACK. THAT'S SEATTLE'S FIRST SACK OF THE GAME. PATRIOTS HAVE THREE. SECOND AND 18. SLINGS IT TO THE OUTSIDE TO BRANDON LaFELL. NOT A LOT OF ROOM. SHERMAN THERE. FOR TOM BRADY, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT STARTED OUT CHRONOLOGICALLY. HE COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE DEAL WAS THE DAY AFTER THE INDIANAPOLIS GAME. THEN HE PLAYED A LOT OF DEFENSE THE FIRST WEEK. THEN THEY GET HERE, HE DID THAT INTERVIEW WITH BOB ON TUESDAY. &gt;&gt; WHICH LOOKED A LITTLE UNCERTAIN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. BUT THEN HE TOLD YOU AS YOU LOOK AT ROGER GOODELL HE TOLD YOU ON WEDNESDAY TO YOUR FACE. &gt;&gt; I SAID, "TOM, LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME YOU COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY SAID ANYTHING TO A BALL BOY, AN ASSISTANT COACH, SOMEBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD LEAD THEM TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WANTED AIR LET OUT OF THAT FOOTBALL." AND HE SAID, "ABSOLUTELY NOT." HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EMPHATIC. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 14. AND BRADY'S GOING TO STEP UP, FIRE OVER THE MIDDLE &gt;&gt; OH! &gt;&gt; AND IT IS TAKEN BY EDELMAN. AND EDELMAN WAS NOT DOWN, EVEN THOUGH HIT BY CHANCELLOR. THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THAT HIS KNEE TOUCHED, BUT THE OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO SPOT THE BALL INSIDE THE 40YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT PLAY HERE BY EDELMAN. CHANCELLOR HIT HIM HARD. AND THEN THE FOREARM LOOKS TO BE DOWN, SO I THINK THEY'RE GONNA BRING THAT ONE BACK. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE KNEE WAS DOWN, TOO. &gt;&gt; FOREARM, ELBOW, KNEE. WE'RE GONNA GET IT ALL. &gt;&gt; NAME IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; AND NOW ONE OFFICIAL COMES IN AND SAYS, "NO, NO, HE'S DOWN." SO THEY'LL SPOT IT AT THE 49, BUT THAT'S STILL A FIRST DOWN. A GAIN OF 21 ON A THIRD AND 14. SO, VERY BIG PLAY FOR THE PATRIOTS, OBVIOUSLY. CLOCK TICKING DOWN TO THE 10MINUTE MARK. FIRST DOWN AT THE 49. &gt;&gt; TELL YOU, YOU RUN A ROUTE ACROSS THE MIDDLE AGAINST THIS DEFENSE, YOU DO SO AGAINST YOUR OWN RISK WITH KAM CHANCELLOR IN THERE. &gt;&gt; BRADY HAS TO DUMP IT TO VEREEN. HE SWINGS TO THE OUTSIDE. SKIRTS THE SIDELINE. CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN BEFORE HE'S THRUST OUT. LATE HIT, FLAG ON THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. DEFENSE, NUMBER 29. LATE HIT OUT OF BOUNDS. 15YARD PENALTY ON THE END OF THE RUN. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; EARL THOMAS. &gt;&gt; HEADY PLAY BY NATE SOLDER HERE. WATCH HIM SET OUTSIDE TO INVITE AVRIL INSIDE, WHICH REALLY SETS THE SPACE FOR THE SCREEN PLAY ON THE OUTSIDE TO SHANE VEREEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S THOMAS KNOCKING HIM DOWN. HE HAD HELP, AS WELL. EARL, NUMBER 29. CALL WENT ON HIM. PATS HAVE IT AT THE 27. FAKE TO VEREEN. BRADY GOING FOR 6. KNOCKED AWAY. BRANDON LaFELL THE INTENDED RECEIVER, AND THAROLD SIMON, WHO CAME IN FOR THE INJURED JEREMY LANE EARLY AND A GUY THEY WERE PICKING ON, WITH THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; FANTASTIC PLAY BY THAROLD SIMON. UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE IN THIS GAME, HAVING TO COME IN, HAVING TO DELIVER. GETS HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE BALL JUST ENOUGH TO FEEL THE RECEIVER ON THE OUTSIDE. GREAT, GREAT PLAY. SOMETIMES, AL, IN THESE BIG GAMES, IT'S THE GUYS YOU LEAST EXPECT, RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING THAT GAME ALL WEEK. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE SURPRISE MVP? &gt;&gt; OH, CHRIS MATTHEWS. WE ALL KNEW THAT, DIDN'T WE? &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10. VEREEN. CUTS IT BACK, TAKES IT TO THE 25. WE GO TO MICHELE. &gt;&gt; YOU MENTIONED HOW JEREMY LANE IS OUT OF THIS GAME AND NOW DEFENSIVE END CLIFF AVRIL IS OUT WITH A CONCUSSION. AND REMEMBER, UNDER THE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL, THE MADDEN RULE PREVENTS ANYONE DIAGNOSED WITH A CONCUSSION FROM COMING BACK OUT OF THE LOCKER ROOM. AND EVEN IF THEY WIN THIS GAME, AL, CLIFF AVRIL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE MEDIA. &gt;&gt; MM. THANK YOU, MICHELE. THERE HE IS. YOU SAW THE PLAY ON WHICH HE WAS HURT. BALL AT THE 25. CLEARLY THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELDGOAL RANGE. THEY SPREAD IT OUT HERE. SO, AT WORST, THEY SHOULD, EVEN WITH AN INCOMPLETION, BE ABLE TO MAKE IT A ONEPOSSESSION GAME. BRADY LOOKING FOR MORE. STEPPING UP. THIRD AND 8. THROWS FIRST DOWN AND MORE. EDELMAN TAKES THE BALL TO THE 3YARD LINE TO SET UP A FIRST DOWN AND GOAL. AND EDELMAN, BOTHERED BY A HIP EARLY IN THE GAME AGAINST INDIANAPOLIS, A LITTLE SLOW IN GETTING UP. &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS DEMARCUS DOBBS, DROPS BACK IN COVERAGE, AND BRADY BRILLIANTLY JUST WAITS FOR HIM TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. EDELMAN, NICE READ. GETS RIGHT ACROSS THE BACK SIDE THERE OF DOBBS. HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; BALL JUST INSIDE THE 5YARD LINE. 8:20 REMAINING IN REGULATION. EDELMAN HAS NOW CAUGHT 24 PASSES IN THE THREE POSTSEASON GAMES. VEREEN IS THE BACK. THE FAKE TO HIM. BRADY FIRES. AND INCOMPLETE. EDELMAN WAS BACKING UP. SIMON COVERING ON THE PLAY. INCOMPLETE, SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; OH, MY GOODNESS. WHAT A MOVE BY JULIAN EDELMAN HERE. WATCH THIS ONE. IN, STOP ON A DIME, BACK OUT. COULD NOT BE MORE WIDE OPEN, AND BRADY MISSED THE THROW. THAT'S AS OPEN AS YOU WILL EVER GET DOWN ON THE GOAL LINE. NO REASON TO HURRY THAT ONE. THAT WAS GAME, SET, AND MATCH. THAT WAS TOTAL VICTORY FOR A WIDE RECEIVER ON THE GOAL LINE. &gt;&gt; BLOUNT IS BACK IN. THE FAKE TO HIM. BRADY DANCES, THROWS. AND IT WILL BE CAUGHT. AMENDOLA FOR THE TOUCHDOWN! SO NEW ENGLAND GOES FROM A SECOND AND 18 AFTER THE FIRST PLAY ON THIS DRIVE TO GO 68 YARDS IN NINE PLAYS AND AN EXTRA POINT AWAY FROM MAKING IT A 3POINT GAME. &gt;&gt; DANNY AMENDOLA. AS POOR AS THE LAST THROW WAS FROM BRADY, THIS ONE IS THAT GOOD. HE JUST HAS TO WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF EARL THOMAS. HE SEES IT. THROW IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER. NO WAY THOMAS CAN GET THERE. WHEW! THIS GAME IS TURNING INTO SOMETHING HERE. &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. &gt;&gt; SO DID THE ODDSMAKERS, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; TOSSUP, JUST ABOUT. FIVE CATCHES FOR AMENDOLA FOR 48 YARDS. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. &gt;&gt; WE COULD BE PLAYING FOOTBALL ALL NIGHT TONIGHT. EVEN IN OVERTIME, THEY PLAY UNTIL SOMEBODY WINS. &gt;&gt; TOM, WITH HIS THREE T.D.s TONIGHT HAS NOW PASSED MONTANA. ALL ALONE AS THE GUY THROWING THE MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS GAME. A DOZEN. GOSTKOWSKI'S KICK. WILL NOT BE RUN BACK. GLENDALE, ARIZONA. FOURTHQUARTER DEFENSE FOR THESE TWO TEAMS. SEATTLE'S LAST EIGHT GAMES, COUNTING THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES, THEY'VE ALLOWED ONE TOUCHDOWN, 13 POINTS, THEN WENT THE LAST SIX REGULARSEASON GAMES WITHOUT ALLOWING A POINT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. AND THEN THE PATRIOTS, VERY SIMILAR, HAVE NOT ALLOWED A TOUCHDOWN IN THEIR LAST EIGHT GAMES, COUNTING THE TWO POSTSEASON GAMES. JUST FOUR FIELD GOALS. NOW, TONIGHT, NEW ENGLAND HAS SCORED HERE IN THE FOURTH, AND WE'LL SEE WHAT SEATTLE CAN MUSTER UP AS THEY START THIS DRIVE FROM THE 20YARD LINE. WILSON OFF PLAYACTION. SURVEYING. TON OF TIME. AND THEN THE RECEIVER FALLS DOWN. LOCKETTE LOOKS AROUND. HE SAYS, "WHERE'S THE FLAG? I GOT KNOCKED DOWN." THERE IS NO FLAG. SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE BUTLER TRIPS HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TRIP OVER EACH OTHER'S FEET. AND THEN HE REACHES OUT AND BASICALLY TRIPS THE RECEIVER. THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF INTERFERENCE. THAT WAS DEFINITELY AN INTENTIONAL ACT. GOT AWAY WITH IT. &gt;&gt; HE DID. SECOND DOWN AND 10. TRIPS LEFT. THREE RECEIVERS THERE. LYNCH. FIGHTING. HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING. TO THE 25YARD LINE. GAIN OF 5. THIRD AND 5. &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES RUSSELL WILSON GREAT? ONE, HIS ESCAPABILITY. EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU COMPLETELY HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL, YOU DON'T HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL. YOU'VE GOT HIM DEAD IN YOUR SIGHTS, YOU CAN'T GET A HAND ON HIM. AND THEN THE DEEP BALLS. HIGH, ARCING THROWS, GIVING HIS RECEIVERS A CHANCE. THOSE TWO COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN THE DIFFERENCE HERE FOR THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS SO FAR. AND AS YOU GET TO THIS POINT IN THE GAME, RUSSELL WILSON RUNNING THE BALL ALWAYS BECOMES A BIG THREAT. &gt;&gt; ON THIRD AND 5. WILSON SLIDING RIGHT. AND THEN THROWS THAT ONE OUT OF BOUNDS. LYNCH GOING DOWN THE SIDELINE, AND INCOMPLETE. SO IT'S A VERY FAST THREEANDOUT. EXACTLY WHAT NEW ENGLAND WAS LOOKING FOR. &gt;&gt; LYNCH IS GOING TO DO A LITTLE OUT AND THEN UP. REALLY, HE WAS WIDE OPEN. JAMIE COLLINS CAME UNDERNEATH THAT LITTLE PICK, BUT IT LOOKED LIKE MARSHAWN LYNCH JUST SORT OF HESITATED AND STOPPED. DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE HE WAS GOING TO THROW IT TO HIM, I GUESS. &gt;&gt; JON RYAN, WHO HAS AVERAGED 46 YARDS A PUNT. YOU SEE AMENDOLA BACKING UP AS THE SHORT MAN. POINTS BACK TO AMENDOLA. HE'LL CALL FOR A FAIR CATCH AND HAUL IT IN AT THE 36. ROBERT KRAFT BOUGHT THE TEAM IN THE MID'90s, TURNED A MEDIOCRE FRANCHISE INTO A JUGGERNAUT. HIS TEAMS HAVE GONE TO SEVEN SUPER BOWLS, INCLUDING ONE WITH BILL PARCELLS. HE'S ONLY HIRED TWO COACHES. THERE'S ONE OF THEM. THE OTHER IS ON THE OTHER SIDELINE. HE INHERITED PARCELLS. THERE IS BELICHICK WITH HIS DEFENSE. OF COURSE, IT'S GOING TO BE A WILD LAST SEVEN MINUTES FOR THE KRAFT FAMILY AND ALL PATRIOT FANS. AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL HOLD? FIRST THINGS FIRST. FROM THE 36YARD LINE. BRADY STARTS OUT OF THE GUN. VEREEN FLANKS HIM. FOURMAN RUSH. BRADY DUMPS. ONEHANDED GRAB BY VEREEN. GAIN OF 8 YARDS. WRIGHT AND CHANCELLOR ARE THERE. IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2. &gt;&gt; TOM BRADY REALLY WANTED TO GO TO GRONKOWSKI. BASICALLY, THEY CAN PICK A SIDE BECAUSE THESE CORNERS DON'T FLIP. HE LOOKED OUT THERE AND THOUGHT BETTER OF THROWING IT OVER TO RICHARD SHERMAN'S SIDE AND THEN GOT A BRILLIANT CATCH FROM VEREEN. IT IS SHANE VEREEN TIME IN THIS GAME. AND, REALLY, THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE HAVING SUCCESS EARLY WHEN THEY WERE WORKING THAT EDELMANVEREEN COMBINATION OVER THE MIDDLE. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 2. BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR A FIRST DOWN. THERE'S VEREEN. CHANCELLOR MAKES THE TACKLE. THAT MOVES THE STICKS. FIRST DOWN TO THE 48. &gt;&gt; THAT TIME GRONKOWSKI KNEW IT WAS MAN COVERAGE. RAN UP THE FIELD. JUST MADE KAM CHANCELLOR SHUFFLE A LITTLE BIT. AND ATHLETICALLY, YOU LIKE VEREEN ON CHANCELLOR IF YOU GET THAT MATCHUP. SO WE'LL SEE IF THEY COME BACK TO THAT. &gt;&gt; AS WE GO DOWN THE STRETCH, EACH TEAM WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; CHANCELLOR ONEONONE ON GRONKOWSKI. &gt;&gt; EDELMAN OUT OF THE SLOT. SEND IT TO HIM. BREAKS A TACKLE. THEN ANOTHER. TAKES THE BALL CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. JULIAN EDELMAN, QUARTERBACK AT KENT STATE. WHAT A PLAYER. WHAT A FIND THIS GUY WAS. SEVENTHROUND DRAFT CHOICE IN 2009. &gt;&gt; HE'S STRONG, AND HE'S ATHLETIC. BUT THE THING THAT I APPRECIATE MORE THAN ANYTHING ABOUT HIM GUY SHOWS UP AT THE COMPLEX AT 5:00 A.M. EVERY DAY. STUDIES, CATCHES EXTRA BALLS ON THE JUGS MACHINE. HE'S MADE HIMSELF A GREAT PLAYER IN THIS LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; UNDER FIVE MINUTES. SWING IT OUT. VEREEN. FIRST DOWN. FLAG COMES DOWN. VEREEN LOST THE BALL, BUT HE WAS DOWN ALREADY. AND WE'LL SEE ABOUT THE CALL. BILL VINOVICH, REFFING HIS FIRST SUPER BOWL GAME. ONLY EIGHT ACCEPTED PENALTIES IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; PASS INTERFERENCE. OFFENSE, NUMBER 11. BLOCKING DOWNFIELD PRIOR TO THE CATCH. 10YARD PENALTY. REPEAT SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO THE CALL IS ON EDELMAN. IT BACKS MIGHT BE ON AMENDOLA. HE SAID 11, BUT IS THAT AMENDOLA? &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, AL. BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE, BRADY HAD TO LOB THAT PASS UP OVER THE TOP. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DESIGNED PLAYS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO DOWN THE FIELD AND INTENTIONALLY BLOCK, THINKING THAT THIS PASS IS GOING TO COME OUT QUICKLY. BUT BECAUSE HE HAD TO LOB IT UP, THE BLOCKING GOT THERE TOO SOON, SO IT'S PASS INTERFERENCE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, HE JUST CHANGED IT. THEY DID CALL IT ON AMENDOLA. BRUCE IRVIN ALMOST GOT A HAND ON IT. SO INSTEAD OF SECOND AND 1, IT'S SECOND AND 11. WE GOT SHERMAN ON LaFELL. THEY HAVEN'T GONE SHERMAN'S WAY. STAYING AWAY FROM HIM. MUCH AS AARON RODGERS DID ON OPENING NIGHT. BRADY. HIT AS HE THROWS. CAUGHT BY GRONKOWSKI! AND THE BIG BULL TAKES IT TO THE 32YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ROLLING THE DICE HERE. THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR BIG SAFETY, KAM CHANCELLOR, ON GRONKOWSKI. EARLIER THEY GOT BURNED WITH K.J. WRIGHT. YOU WANT TO GO MAN COVERAGE AND I THINK A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE SHANE VEREEN'S BEEN EFFECTIVE COMING OUT OF THE BACKFIELD, THEY'VE HAD TO CHANGE UP THEIR SECONDARY COVERAGE A LITTLE BIT. AND RIGHT NOW JOSH McDANIELS GOT IT GOING WITH THIS PLAY CALLING. &gt;&gt; BRADY HUNG IN UNDER PRESSURE. BALL AT THE 32. ALREADY WITHIN GOSTKOWSKI'S FIELDGOAL RANGE. BRADY WILL SWING IT OUT. VEREEN. AND THERE'S RICHARD SHERMAN, WHOSE GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNANT. SHE'S DUE IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, BUT SHE'S HERE. HE'S READY TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL IN UNIFORM IF NEED BE. &gt;&gt; WELL, AND RICHARD WAS TELLING US THAT SHE SAID, "YOU GO PLAY THE SUPER BOWL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'VE GOT ALL THAT SET UP IF SOMETHING GETS ACCELERATED HERE." &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. THROWN AT ONE TIME. ONCE. RICHARD SAYS, "IT'S EVERYTHING I CAN DO TO KEEP FROM GETTING BORED." &gt;&gt; I GUARANTEE HE'S NOT BORED RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; MNHMNH. SECOND AND 10. LITTLE MORE THAN 4 TO GO. BRADY FIRES. CAUGHT. FIRST DOWN. AND AGAIN THEY GO TO GRONKOWSKI. OUT AT THE 20YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; AL, HERE IT IS AGAIN. THEY'RE JUST TELLING TOM BRADY THIS IS MAN COVERAGE. HE'S OFF. HE'S INSIDE. HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT GRONKOWSKI. EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING THAT KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL KNOWS THAT'S MAN COVERAGE. AND 1,000% OF THE TIME NOW, THEY ARE GONNA THROW IT RIGHT THERE WHEN THEY GET THAT LOOK. &gt;&gt; HALF A DOZEN CATCHES FOR HIM. NOW THROUGH THE MIDDLE. BIG HOLE FOR VEREEN, AND HE TAKES THE BALL TO THE 12YARD LINE. BOBBY WAGNER IS THERE. YOU KNOW, 3:20, YOU BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT USING THE CLOCK. THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELDGOAL RANGE, BUT SEATTLE STILL HAS ALL OF ITS TIMEOUTS. YOU STILL HAVE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE FOUR OPPORTUNITIES TO STOP THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ABOUT SCORING A TOUCHDOWN RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; CORRECT. ANY WAY YOU CAN AT ANY TIME YOU CAN. &gt;&gt; NO CLOCK MANAGEMENT. &gt;&gt; NOT YET. NOT YET. THREE MINUTES TO GO. SECOND AND 3. BRADY TO THE OUTSIDE. CAUGHT AND THAT'S LaFELL BEFORE HE STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS. HE IS OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 6YARD LINE, AND THAT MAKES IT FIRST AND GOAL WITH 2:52 ON THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; THEY FINALLY COME OUT OF THAT MAN COVERAGE AND GO A ZONE. BUT THEY'RE REALLY LUCKY THAT LaFELL ON THAT ONE COULDN'T GET HIMSELF UNDER CONTROL. BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD HAVE SCORED. &gt;&gt; 71 IS REPORTING AS ELIGIBLE. 71 IS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR THE ANNOUNCEMENT. FLEMING COMES IN, THE TACKLE, AS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER 71. EARL THOMAS PLAYING THE MIDDLE. BRADY LOOKING AT THE CLOCK. BRADY SAYS, "I'LL TAKE A TIMEOUT." PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO :02. TOM WILL GO TO THE SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; TOM BRADY TONIGHT HAS PUT IT UP 49 TIMES. THE 36 COMPLETIONS IS A SUPER BOWL RECORD. CRAZY TWO WEEKS. GREAT GAME. WHO KNOWS WHAT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WILL HOLD? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I THINK EVERYBODY WE KNOW THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT TED WELLS' INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS WITH EGG ON THEIR FACE. EITHER THE PATRIOTS, THE LEAGUE OFFICE, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCUSED THE PATRIOTS. ALL THAT STUFF'S IN PLAY. BUT ISN'T IT GLORIOUS JUST FOR THESE THREE OR FOUR HOURS HERE, THAT YOU CAN JUST ENJOY A FOOTBALL GAME? &gt;&gt; WELL, AS THE OLD COACH JOHN MADDEN ALWAYS SAID, "YOU KNOW, A GAME BREAKS OUT." AND IT BROKE OUT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE IT IS GOING TO BE BIG IN THE FOLLOWING MONTH. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, FLEMING AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER, NUMBER 71. FIRST AND GOAL. THE BALL AT THE 6. DEVELIN, THE FULLBACK. BLOUNT IS THE RUNNING BACK. BLOUNT. AND BLOUNT POWERING HIS WAY TO THE 3YARD LINE. STOPPED THERE. GAIN OF 3. SECOND DOWN AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GONNA TRY AND LOAD UP AND GO WITH THE BIG POWER RUNNER, EVEN THOUGH IT'S BASICALLY BEEN VEREEN AND THE MATCHUP PROBLEMS THAT HE HAS CREATED THAT'S GOTTEN THEM DOWN THE FIELD HERE. &gt;&gt; UNDER 2:30. BLOUNT OUT. VEREEN IN. SECOND AND GOAL. BRADY. CAUGHT TOUCHDOWN! JULIAN EDELMAN! &gt;&gt; CAME BACK TO IT, AL. THEY CAME RIGHT BACK TO IT. DOWN, BACK OUT. WORKED BRILLIANTLY BEFORE. BRADY MISSED THE PASS. COME RIGHT BACK TO IT, AND EDELMAN GETS IT DONE. NO PUSHOFF. NO FOUL. NO NOTHING. AND TOM BRADY TAKES THEM RIGHT DOWN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; AND THERE AGAIN, THEY GO TO WORK ON THAROLD SIMON, WHO TOOK THE PLACE OF THE INJURED JEREMY LANE. THEY PICKED ON HIM EARLY. HE GOT HIS FEET UNDER HIM. PLAYED WELL FOR ABOUT A QUARTER AND A HALF. THEY GO BACK THAT WAY AGAIN AND BURN HIM. GOSTKOWSKI FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND THAT MAKES IT A 4POINT LEAD, MEANING SEATTLE'S GONNA NEED A TOUCHDOWN. LAST TWO NEW ENGLAND DRIVES 9 PLAYS FOR 68, 10 PLAYS FOR 64. AND THE KRAFT FAMILY ROBERT AND JONATHAN. THEY'VE SEEN A FEW EXCITING GAMES. AGAIN, YOU'VE GOT A CLOSE GAME. EVERY SUPER BOWL THAT NEW ENGLAND'S PLAYED IN SINCE BELICHICK AND BRADY TOOK OVER HAS BEEN DECIDED BY 4 OR LESS. RUSSELL WILSON'S BEEN HERE BEFORE. HECK, HE WAS DOWN 160 TWO WEEKS AGO. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF WHAT RUSSELL WILSON TOLD US. HE SAID, THE MINUTE I PULLED THAT TROPHY DOWN I HELD IT UP IN THE AIR AND I PULLED IT DOWN, AND I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT ONE. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT SUPER BOWL OPPORTUNITY." HE SAID HE WANTED SIX. HE GREW UP REMEMBERING MICHAEL JORDAN HOLDING UP SIX FINGERS. HE SAID, "I'M LOOKING FOR SIX." THIS SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE ON HIS SHOULDERS WITH TWO MINUTES TO GO. &gt;&gt; SO 2:02. IF THE KICKOFF IS A TOUCHBACK, THEY'RE GOING TO GET A PLAY BEFORE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. OTHERWISE, THE CLOCK'S GOING TO STOP. THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. AND GOSTKOWSKI WILL SEND THAT ONE DEEP INTO THE NIGHT. SO THEY WILL GET ONE PLAY OFF BEFORE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. THAT WILL STOP THE CLOCK, AND THEY'LL PRESERVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS. PATRIOTS OVERCOMING A 10POINT DEFICIT. AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO BRADY TELLING US YESTERDAY, "THERE WOULD NOT BE A GAME I WOULD WANT TO WIN MORE THAN THIS ONE." LYNCH GETS FLANKED OUT. EMPTY BACKFIELD. WILSON. DOWN THE SIDELINE. LYNCH MAKES THE CATCH! AND HE'LL GET TACKLED BY JAMIE COLLINS. BUT THAT'S A BIG GAIN, TAKING US TO THE 2MINUTE WARNING. THEY STILL HAVE THEIR THREE TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT A CALL THAT WAS BY DARRELL BEVELL. RUSSELL WILSON SAW MARSHAWN LYNCH ONEONONE AGAINST THE LINEBACKER, JAMIE COLLINS. SLANT AND GO. TO A RUNNING BACK. THAT IS CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF NOT JUST RUSSELL WILSON, BUT MARSHAWN LYNCH. AND A TRUST WITH THE SEASON ON THE LINE. BRILLIANT CALL. BRILLIANT THROW. AND NOW THEY'RE AT MIDFIELD. COULD THIS GAME BE ANY BETTER? &gt;&gt; MMMMMMM. PLENTY LEFT, TOO. 1:55. THAT WAS LYNCH'S FIRST CATCH OF THE GAME. THEY BLITZ. WILSON FIRES. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR KEARSE. LOOKS AROUND FOR A FLAG. GETS NONE. MALCOLM BUTLER, THE ROOKIE OUT OF WEST ALABAMA, A FREE AGENT, WITH THE DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THIS ROOKIE IS THINKING? AND HE COULD NOT HAVE PLAYED THIS BETTER. PERFECT POSITION. GOING TO COME, JUMP INSIDE, KNOCK IT AWAY. BRILLIANT PLAY. &gt;&gt; MMMMM. FROM THE 49. SECOND AND 10. PLAY CLOCK AT :01. AND NOW WILSON HAS TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. SO THEY HAVE THREE, SO HE TAKES ONE HERE. PLAY CLOCK WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN. &gt;&gt; FIRST CHARGED TIMEOUT, SEATTLE. 30SECOND TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? CHRIS MATTHEWS, WHO'S HAD THE UNBELIEVABLE GAME, BECAUSE TEAMS WORK ON PACKAGES OF PLAYS, AND SO WHEN YOU GET IN THE 2MINUTE OFFENSE, THEY'VE PRACTICED WITH THE GUYS THAT THEY HAVE IN THERE BALDWIN AND LOCKETTE AND KEARSE. AND SO HE HASN'T BEEN A PART OF THIS. AND YET IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE GAME, YOU KNOW HE'S THE ONE THAT SORT OF BROKE IT OPEN. &gt;&gt; SURE. NOW HE'S COMING IN. HE'LL BE A PART OF THIS NEXT PLAY HERE ON SECOND DOWN AND 10. MATTHEWS HAS CAUGHT 4 FOR 109 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN. SECOND AND 10. TWO TIMEOUTS NOW LEFT FOR THE SEAHAWKS. KEY GUYS ON THE FIELD. WILLSON, THE TIGHT END, HAS NOT CAUGHT A PASS IN THIS GAME. DEEP DROP. TON OF TIME. GOING FOR IT ALL. KNOCKED AWAY. BROWNER IS BACK THERE. THERE WAS MATTHEWS. AND BRANDON BROWNER, WHO WAS A SEAHAWK LAST YEAR BUT WAS SUSPENDED AT THE END OF THE SEASON AND HAD TO WATCH THE SUPER BOWL HAS A RING AND THEN LEFT FOR NEW ENGLAND IN FREE AGENCY. &gt;&gt; GONNA GO RIGHT UP THE SEAM HERE. THE PATRIOTS CAME WITH A THREEMAN RUSH. AND THEY MADE THIS SWITCH EARLY. AND I THINK, FOR MATT PATRICIA, IT'S BEEN A GOOD ONE. THE JUMP BALLS, NOW THAT YOU HAVE A 6'4" CORNERBACK, ARE A LITTLE MORE FAIR, LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 10. FLANK LYNCH AGAIN. WILSON. HANGS IN THERE. THROWS. THAT'S CAUGHT. THAT'S GOING TO BE A FIRST DOWN. 38YARD LINE. RICARDO LOCKETTE. AND NOW THEY'LL HUSTLE UP TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE, PRESERVING THE TIMEOUTS. UNDER 1:30 TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN WHEN LOGAN RYAN HAS BEEN IN THE GAME THE PLAY RIGHT BEFORE THE HALF AND NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK TO HIM. LOCKETTE IS A GUY WITH BRILLIANT SPEED, SO RYAN HAS TO BE CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; RUSSELL IN THE POCKET. RUSSELL FOR KEARSE, AND IT'S BROKEN UP AGAIN. AND IS IT BUT SOMEHOW... &gt;&gt; HOLY COW. &gt;&gt; DID HE WIND UP WITH THE FOOTBALL? &gt;&gt; I THINK BUTLER HIT IT AND IT FELL RIGHT BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND. UNBELIEVABLE! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, ISN'T IT? &gt;&gt; WELL, KEARSE GOES FOR IT. IT'S STILL NOT ON THE GROUND. IT'S STILL WHOA, LOOK AT THAT. PHENOMENAL. &gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE HE DIDN'T GET UP AND GET IN THE END ZONE IN TIME. &gt;&gt; AND THEN BUTLER TAKES HIM OUT. SO HE BREAKS UP THE PLAY, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY LOOK AT THAT. DOES A JUGGLING ACT. HAS IT AT THE 5. FIRST AND GOAL. 33 YARDS. AND NOW, BY THE TIME THEY GET DOWN THERE, THE PLAY CLOCK HAS RUN OUT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; AND SEATTLE TAKES A TIMEOUT. CRAZY! &gt;&gt; HOW MANY DIFFERENT PLAYS ARE THE PATRIOTS GOING TO HAVE LIKE THIS? MARIO MANNINGHAM, DAVID TYREE. AND NOW KEARSE. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS WHERE TYREE HAD THE HELMET CATCH. THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE CRIME FOR NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; AND TOM BRADY HAD THAT LOOK ON HIS FACE LIKE, "YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. NOT AGAIN." &gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO BACK TO SUPER BOWL XLII. TYREE MAKES THE CATCH. OUR BUDDY RODNEY HARRISON HAD A BIRD'SEYE VIEW. PLAXICO BURRESS WINDS UP WITH THE TOUCHDOWN TO WIN THE GAME AND END WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT SEASON FOR THE PATRIOTS. THEY WERE 180 COMING IN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AL, YOU PLAY 16 GAMES, COUPLE OF PLAYOFF GAMES, AND IT COMES DOWN TO ONE TIPPED BALL THAT FALLS ON THE GROUND TO SOMEBODY WHO'S LYING ON HIS BACK. [ BOTH LAUGH ] &gt;&gt; PAUL ALLEN HAS SEEN IT ALL, BUT NOT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE NOT IN YET. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S DURON HARMON, WHO COMES OVER THE TOP. HE HAD A CHANCE TO MAYBE KICK IT AWAY. KEARSE COMES UP WITH IT. AMAZING. THE BALL AT THE 5. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE TO STOP MARSHAWN LYNCH. &gt;&gt; HERE HE GOES. BEAST MODE. TO THE HALFYARD LINE. AND NOW NEW ENGLAND HAS TO THINK ABOUT TAKING A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; BOY, THE LAST TIME WE CALLED A SUPER BOWL, AL, REMEMBER? &gt;&gt; AHMAD BRADSHAW. &gt;&gt; DO YOU LET THEM SCORE? DO YOU PUT THE BALL BACK IN THE HANDS OF TOM BRADY? AND I GUARANTEE YOU BILL BELICHICK IS SITTING HERE THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IT'S ON HIS MIND. IT HAS TO BE. DO YOU BLEED THE CLOCK ALL THE WAY DOWN? THEY'RE BLEEDING IT RIGHT DOWN TO HALF A MINUTE. SECOND AND GOAL. BALDWIN SETS UP ON THE LEFT. PLAY CLOCK AT :05. PASS IS INTERCEPTED AT THE GOAL LINE BY MALCOLM BUTLER! UNREAL! MALCOLM BUTLER, WHO ALMOST MADE THE PHENOMENAL PLAY THAT WOUND UP IN KEARSE'S ARMS. THERE ARE FLAGS ON THE FIELD FOR CELEBRATION. AMAZING! BUTLER, A ROOKIE FREE AGENT OUT OF WEST ALABAMA. &gt;&gt; THEY TRIED A PICK PLAY, AL. THEY TRIED TO GO HERE, BUT HE BEATS HIM TO THE PUNCH. AND I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CALL. &gt;&gt; ME NEITHER. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT BELIEVE THE CALL. YOU'VE GOT MARSHAWN LYNCH IN THE BACKFIELD. YOU'VE GOT A GUY THAT'S BEEN BORDERLINE UNSTOPPABLE IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CALL. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S BRADY. AS DEMONSTRATIVE AS EVER. AND RICHARD SHERMAN GOING, "WHAT?" I AGREE WITH YOU. WHY MAKE THAT CALL? YOU'RE DOWN ON THE HALFYARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT AGAINST THE NEW ENGLAND BENCH AFTER THE INTERCEPTION. THE PENALTY WILL BE HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL. NEW ENGLAND KEEPS THE BALL. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S HALF THE DISTANCE TO THE GOAL, WHICH IS NEXT TO NOTHING. AND NOW SEATTLE HAD TO USE TWO TIMEOUTS, SO THEY CAN ONLY STOP THE CLOCK ONCE. AND BARRING COMPLETE INSANITY AND I MEAN COMPLETE... &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; ...IT'S GOING TO BE A WIN FOR THE PATRIOTS. &gt;&gt; I I'M SITTING HERE, AND I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT PLAY CALL. IF I LOSE THE SUPER BOWL BECAUSE MARSHAWN LYNCH CAN'T GET IT IN FROM THE 1YARD LINE, SO BE IT. SO BE IT. BUT THERE IS NO WAY... III DON'T BELIEVE THE CALL. YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT IT, YOU THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. OTHER TEAM PRACTICES, TOO. [ SIGHS ] &gt;&gt; SO, NOW, BARRING A FUMBLED SNAP WELL, LET'S SEE. BRADY'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BALL OUT OF THE END ZONE. OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE 2 POINTS AND THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE A FREE KICK FROM THE 20. THAT'S SEATTLE'S FIRST TURNOVER OF THE GAME. &gt;&gt; SECOND CHARGED TIMEOUT, NEW ENGLAND. &gt;&gt; FIGURE OUT A WAY WELL, BRADY'S SO GOOD AT THE SNEAK. JUST TAKE IT AND START PLOWING FORWARD. JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T WIND UP WITH THE BALL IN THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; SO YOU GOT THE PICK PLAY, ALL RIGHT? YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT, YOU THINK BUT WHY? I YOU KNOW, HOW ABOUT MALCOLM BUTLER? GIVES UP THE FLUKE PLAY DOWN THE FIELD. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE. AND MAKES AN INCREDIBLE PLAY. YOU GOT TO GET IT OUT OF HERE, THOUGH. AND BELICHICK WILL SAY, "MAKE SURE THESE GUYS FIRE OFF." LOOK AT EVERYBODY INSIDE. OH, MY GOODNESS. &gt;&gt; OF ALL THINGS, IF THEY JUMPED OFF AND WEREN'T DRAWN, THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE 6YARD LINE. THE OFFICIALS WILL CONFER. &gt;&gt; MICHAEL BENNETT JUMPS OFFSIDES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. 10 TIMES THIS YEAR. AND IN THIS CRITICAL, LASTCHANCE MOMENT, HE DOES AGAIN. &gt;&gt; UNLESS HE WAS DRAWN. &gt;&gt; ENCROACHMENT. &gt;&gt; AND HE WASN'T. &gt;&gt; DEFENSE, NUMBER 72. 5YARD PENALTY. STILL FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; GIVE BRADY CREDIT. HE JUST DREW HIM. THEY WERE GOING TOTAL SCRUM IN BEHIND. AND BILL BELICHICK KNOWS, AFTER ALL THE HEARTBREAK. WE SAW IT, AL. TYREE, MARIO MANNINGHAM, FLUKY PLAYS. THIS TIME, AFTER ALL THE STUFF OF THESE TWO WEEKS... &gt;&gt; AND THEN A SCRUM, OF COURSE. HERE YOU GO. FLAGS. SO YOU'LL HAVE AN UGLY ENDING TO WHAT WAS A PRETTY TERRIFIC BALL GAME. WELL, A LOT OF FRUSTRATION OUT THERE FOR THE GUYS IN BLUE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, FROM SEATTLE'S STANDPOINT... WHATEVER. FROM NEW ENGLAND'S STANDPOINT, YOU'RE 18 SECONDS AWAY FROM A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP. YOU DON'T THROW A PUNCH AT ANYBODY HERE. GRONKOWSKI TAKES A SHOT FROM BENNETT, WHO I'M SURE IS FRUSTRATED. THEN GRONKOWSKI THROWS ONE BACK, AND HERE WE GO. [ LAUGHS ] EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN THE NFL, YOU THINK YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL. &gt;&gt; NO, YOU HAVEN'T. &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER GET OVER THROWING THE BALL IN THAT SITUATION. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND FINAL TIMEOUT, SEATTLE. &gt;&gt; NEITHER WILL SEAHAWK FANS. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE PLAY, PERSONAL FOUL, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS. INSTIGATOR, NUMBER 51, HAS BEEN EJECTED. 15YARD PENALTY. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT IS BRUCE IRVIN. MEANWHILE, THINK ABOUT BUTLER. THIS KID IS A FREE AGENT. PLAYED AT A SMALLER SCHOOL. HE'S FROM VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI. PLAYED AT WEST ALABAMA. PATS SIGNED HIM LAST MAY. TRANSFERRED FROM HINDS, MISSISSIPPI, COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SUPER BOWL HERO. &gt;&gt; AND, AL, YOU COULD TELL HE HAD DONE HIS HOMEWORK. HE SAW THE PICK PLAY COMING. THE MINUTE HIS RECEIVER CAME INSIDE, HE FIRED. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE ON, HE WASN'T GONNA GET THERE. HE WAS GONNA GIVE UP THE GAMEWINNING TOUCHDOWN. BUT HE DID HIS HOMEWORK AND HE FIRED HIS SHOT AND MADE THE PLAY OF THE YEAR. &gt;&gt; SO THE PATRIOTS ON THE CUSP OF MAKING IT FOUR IN THE 21st CENTURY. BELICHICK'S ALREADY TAKEN THE SHOWER. HIS TEAM DOWN BY 10... IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. BOB KRAFT AND JONATHAN KRAFT ARE ALREADY DOWN THERE. AND ONE KNEELDOWN SHOULD END THE GAME. WHAT A JOURNEY. THE SKY WAS FALLING IN EARLY OCTOBER. THERE'S A LOT OF BRIGHT SUNSHINE RIGHT NOW IN FOXBOROUGH AND ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND. AND AFTER THE WACKIEST LEADUP TO A SUPER BOWL EVER, THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS ARE THE NFL CHAMPIONS. &gt;&gt; GREAT GAME. &gt;&gt; GIVE THEM ROOM, GUYS. GIVE THEM ROOM.
