============================================================

all pro middle linebacker Luke Kuechly remains in the concussion protocol for the second straight week and strong safety Kirk Coleman joined him there this week and then there's Mario Addison al who leads the Panthers with six and a half sacks he is out tonight with a foot injury yes Michelle they are really playing with a short deck on that side of the wall the tradition here the twelves is what they are called Lockette about to be introduced to the crowd he was a wide receiver for the Seahawks between 2011 and 15 and suffered a careerending injury last season so a Ricardo will get to hoist the flag above the Hawks Nest here at CenturyLink Field on a really nice day a lot yesterday blue skies for the most part today and the temperature is 41 degrees who annoys your place in the National Football League there are a few but it's generally regarded as number one here in Seattle when it comes to the decibel meter Seattle to kick off Carolina Joe Webb back to receive he's also their number three quarterback Stephen Houska will put this one in the air and Sunday Night Football is underway it's fielded at the five yard line by Fozzy Whittaker and Whitaker gets taken down before he can reach the 20 yard line by kiko Thorpe let's take a look at the starters for the Panthers Cam Newton our University Jonathan Stewart the University of Oregon jail from Desmond deep Florida State say again jr. the Irish state university Greg Olson the youth at Dixon Oregon Ducks my crummers Oregon State Andrew nor well be allow stay Tyler Larson Utah State christopher Scott Tennessee Trey Turner LSU how about this they start with Derrick Anderson at quarterback he's their number two guy they're going to go rights of the air on playaction and the pass is intercepted it's picked off Mike Morgan will take it to the seven yard line so the Carolina Panthers go to Derek Anderson shocking everybody on the first play of the game it's juggled it's deflected and it's going to be first and goal for Seattle yeah I don't know possibly I'm shocked by Colvard as well a thing just bounced right off of him and Mike Morgan coming back from his sports hernia injury and has one fall right in his lap so the home crowd noisy enough is going to be insane now as Cam Newton stands by and watches and you wonder why he was standing by and watching I know you Ron Rivera well he's riverboat run and let's try to draw to an inside flush Thomas Rath is the running back Wilson Nancy tua Rawls who was their leading ground gainer last season has been hurt for a good part of this season picks up about it's gonna be second down and go for Wilson who is finally healthy it's the first time he hasn't been on the injury report since the first game of the season but still the numbers are good he had an ankle injury and a knee injury in the first three games and part of the reason that he didn't run very much was because of those injuries but last week he ran for 80 yards in the loss at Tampa Bay second down and goal fake the jet sweep Wilson goes and it's caught at the 5 yard line by Doug Baldwin third and goal and we'll take a look at the Seattle offense Russell Wilson the whole pack of bad news so Monroe central mission Doug Baldwin Stanford Jermaine Kearse University of Washington Tyler Lockett Kansas State Jimmy Graham the you George pant WESH 2 Kentucky mark Lawrence Key West Virginia Justin Britt LH s mi z Germaine de fitty giggle Maggie's Bradley cell Ole Miss two rookies on the offensive front Wilson a wall in the backfield and that's almost picked off trade Boston almost had the interception so Wilson looked like he was gonna run had to be careful lapped across the line of scrimmage and then a little shovel pass into the end zone fourth down in comes the field goal unit what APIs are looking play all the actions going to come over from this side as trae Boston dives and really had his hands on that ball that would have been the most bizarre start a game we've seen in a long time but basically Seattle comes out and steals three points that give credit to Carolina's defense for the hole 23yard attempt for acoustic and that is pretty crazy one minute and 37 seconds to gets done tonight football started 3 nothing Seattle said that I football being brought to you by the 2017 Kia Sorento learn worid Kia comm by GE we imagined a better world then they get real by Walmart to find gifts groceries and more this season and by Sprint visits print.com Seahawks and Panthers players given back to the community came to the Thomas Davis sexy reveal Charlotte and Chancellor hosting a holiday toy drive here in Seattle I wish they would have given up a little information about what's going on with their quarterback this is just a bizarre start to this game right you begin to wonder any number of things mean injury sickness suspension for one game but sin oh we for one play series or whatever and we'll try to flush that out as the kick is down to the end zone there by Joep so now here comes Cam Newton just bizarre the only thing I'll say is I've been around some teams they were on the road this entire week stayed over on the west coast perhaps something happened and Rivera said okay you're not starting the game I'm just wild speculation here maybe if they had both quarterbacks in the game you say is some sort of a trick but you're not going to take Cam Newton out of the game the one play unless something happen I would think I just don't know you it has to be something as I said what try to flesh it out as we go along here from 25 yard line to look at Newton's numbers he was last year's regular season MVP in the world the Jonathan Stewart for a long time he's been their number one running back and let's take a look at the defense Michael Bennett 80 Taylor high school a table Rubin Iowa State's on the mag game Tennessee Cliff Avril Boilermaker KJ right Mississippi State Bobby Wagner deeds our state Mike Morgan USC Richard Sherman stamp with Cam chassis Virginia Tech Perot Thomas vbu Texas Sean shed for the state once again that Seattle defense best in the league fewest points allowed 17 for take it it's tackled up at the 29yard line John Perry is the referee tonight we'll hear from him for the first time and you've got a penalty against the defense coming across the line oxide defense number 72 lined up in the neutral zone at the snap fiveyard penalty replay second down well then it comes back first time inside there and the ball is up and here somewhere so he just lined up offsides you know you stay away for a few games too sometimes those angles ankles start looking a little bit different down there he sees he's picked up a few flags oh yeah that the shirt underneath the shoulder fans looking like he's in the NBA right now second and four this is a makeshift offensive line up front they could use a first down or two to get settled in this game on the ground nice run there by Stewart looked like he was stopped once than twice and he's able to pick up the first down after the 37 Chancellor comes up to make the hit well let's start with one of the veterans first of all Andrew Norwell right there is going to come across on this little block against the top of Rubin and just take him right out of there so they do get that initial first down and they're going to stay on the ground here early has been the one steady guy this year everybody else is even a bird or out or whatever goals played every game at left guard the cache is knocked down up at the 42 yard line KJ Wright with the coverage great coverage linebacker and he'll be seeing a lot of Greg Olson tonight I just don't know if you can come up with a much more underrated football player than that guy right there KJ Wright's been doing it for a long time he's second on this team the tackles has three sacks one of the better cover linebackers around doesn't seem to get a lot of credit port surrounded by superstar players but KJ right year after year one of the best and that's why he's you've got in the big names you get Thomas and Chancellor and Bennett Sherman so you don't hear it that much about right second and ten nationally making the catch again but it was all he could do to just come down with it and he's out of bounds after a short game in a one third and nine Carolina Panthers no with the entire from the center out to the right side everybody being shuffled even if they do throw the ball they're either going to have to go hard play action of some kind to try and hold these pass rushers or simply get the ball out now you end up in a third down and long Cam Newton has to know this is a short clock here he can't hold this ball third a 95 receiver set three pressure from the outside in Seattle almost and its second interception and a little bit more than four minutes most teams will do this they'll spy Cam Newton this time the reverse cam cam Chancellor is going to jump up and get this thing he's about a six for safety back there in the middle of the field you take a look at him on the field and you go my goodness is that guy really a safety weighs about 230 pounds and makes plays like that Mike Palardy had to take over for the injured Andy we chose done a nice job averaging 46.7 as well as field lock it trying to get around back shop and with a flag that would figure when you run that far across the field you you know you're going like 40 yards horizontally sooner or later a flag will be dropped 43 yard kick for the moment 23 yard return look like almost every punt return illegal block in the back return team number 33 half the distance to the goal first and 10 timeout Jon Perry took the words out of my mouth then I have to go on the court is we nothing don't miss a moment of tonight's game with the NBC sports app you can watch the game anywhere live on your laptop tablet or connected TV it's about 600 feet high it's the Space Needle here in Seattle on a beautiful night back to the link we come after the penalty Seattle starts this drug from their own 8 yard line second possession is really it's thought 7yard gain by curse let's take a look at the Carolina defense so Johnson University start up the little a University of Utah KY short Purdue West Horton USC Shaq Thompson Washington AJ Klein Iowa State University Thomas Davis Julian James Bradbury Sanford University Michael Griffin Texas straight Boston North Carolina yeah Worley West Virginia those two rookie corners final rocket is off to the races here down the sideline he goes and he finally gets taken down by Davis racing all the way down field to the 45 yard line so rocket the secondyear guy out of Kansas State with a 40 yard reception the ends up coming in short motion down here and they just get confused and then you get the new safety in their trade Boston who's taken over for Kirk Coleman just taking a bad ankle and all of a sudden backed up against your own goal line is now in plus territory at the 46yard line rolls of course one of the guys they're missing is as good a linebacker as there is in the NFL right now there is Luke Kuechly we did the Thursday night game in Carolina against New Orleans when he was Burke didn't know originally what it was needed to do the players and it turned out to be a concussion so he's in the concussion protocol had a nice visit with him on the field before the game he hopes he can get back next week but it's not going to push it and of course it's up to the medical staff to determine when he would be ready to play second in a big hole over the left side and the spin move on roars to get the first down I like this Thomas walls we had a chance to watch him practice last year around this time and Thomas Rawls what you're gonna see Jimmy Graham a nice block down here as well but Thomas Rawls was one of those guys just before he got hurt I remember watching a practice going who is that he was just lightning quick came out a couple of weeks ago did pretty well just wasn't quite himself last week maybe almost that preseason form a little sore a little beat up but watching him practice again this week they think he's razor sharp ready for a big night from the 36 yard line we'll send go on corridor passion and contact but no flag there try to lock it along with Robert MacLean simply an incomplete pass second down you know this is a Carolina defense that's have to reshuffle a lot of very important parts here tonight Kirk Coleman their safety and signal caller is out at the safety position Luke Kuechly the other signal caller at linebacker is also on the sidelines and they're leading sacker Mario Addison is out of this one so a little bit makeshift tonight for the Panthers no got second down and 10 a lot of talk on the field me yes who's able to keep on going the claim hadn't stopped a couple of yards past the line of scrimmage but that didn't stop him and he picks up a first down he saw Thomas Davis he's going crazy out there he thought he saw Thomas Rawls flinch and he did pretty good block there by Rawls like it was all part of some signal and basically Davis kind of threw himself out of position by trying to get the call and then winds up making a tackle when the bullet is now with the 24 the 750 the gallery opening quarter keep it it's around the corner and Russell Wilson's stepping out of bounds at the 22 yard line pushed Brian Delayer out of the way so we talked about the ankle injury the knee injury he wasn't right he gained only 79 yards as you see through the first 10 games 2 yards per carry then last week 80 yards he eclipsed his season total in one game at a Bay though they did lose the game 14 to 5 and the other part of it was he started making some of those unorthodox kind of throws those movies and second the name in the pass over the middle and that's Jimmy Graham setting up a first and goal just that big body over the middle nothing fancy about the round is going to come inside and that heart playaction fake is going to hold those linebackers it's one of those plays that this team just runs so well and when you have the great receiving threat way both these teams have on their respective teams makes it easy let's not Seattle started this Drive at their own eight Mather at the Carolina fee lots of space and room touchdown Seattle they got 92 yards 9 plays 4 runs and 5 passes watch the quickness of this cut over here is exactly what I was talking about with Thomas walls just electric and go way that Shaq Thompson could catch him from there that's the sort of elite quickness that could really make a difference for this Seattle running game and their offensive line as they try and get some of that forward push nice ride so the extra point now from house good John Ryan to hold it and Seahawks off to a flying start under the number two seed in the NFC ten nothing Seahawks well around the league beginning Thursday night through the weekend including tomorrow night my cos my cleats this week the players proudly displaying the charitable causes the champion or they're on their game day cleats and you can discover their personal tributes at NFL comm slash my cause my cleats and a lot of cool ones all day long could be here tonight in Seattle where the Seahawks off to a flying start we tend to nothing this is a kick that will be Fozzy Whittaker back to the 25yard Lani and we go to Michelle well those cleats let's talk about Gregg Olsen's cause it's the artist yard the part of his Foundation which supports families of children being treated for congenital heart disease at Charlotte's Levine Children's Hospital were Olson son TJ who was born with a heart defect receives care and Richard Sherman's is his blanket coverage foundation devoted to helping innercity kids with school supplies also the homeless and needy families during the holidays a good stop oh it is Michelle and it's been very successful I think probably won't see it every year on one weekend for sure in the future the Richard Sherman right there Greg Olson right there begins to strive now from the yard line fake the Stewart and a toss back to take in again works his way up to the 35 that's a gain of six it'll be second down and four our Chancellor makes the tackle a lot of changes on this offensive line Mike Rimmer's the left tackle started at right tackle at the beginning of the year andrew Norwell still the same tyler Larson essentially the fourth strength center now Chris Scott comes in at guard he would have been the third string Center and Trey Turner bumps out the right guard the right tackle me for a first down that's Kelvin Benjamin at a great rookie year could hurt in training camp missed all of last season and this year he's been he's been a little off and on yeah but he's that big receiver that Cam Newton can use down the middle of the field and sometimes get the feeling that maybe they'll try and match him up against the Sean shed over here he is coming off of a hamstring injury the river bill three receivers bunch to the right side Newton's gonna fire to the left side and in a lot of traffic somehow Olsen comes away with it with nothing but blue shirts around him Greg Olson first down he had to basically throw it over the head of Bobby Wagner I think it was who is running right back towards Olson and it whistled make passes he roll right into the arms of Greg Olson talking about a confidence low that was a cop and a throw turnout of course no other in terms of the decimal level Newton gets it off take the dog to the 36 yard line where it'll make it second down and four remember Ryan Khalil is the guy that would be the center and so you run up here behind this fourth string Center Tyler Larsen it's so loud if you've got to communicate it individually and the guy you want to make sure it gets it is the center so you knows when to snap that football and every time you do stuff like this in a crowd like this you're going to get them even more engaged but second down and five now Newton comes up and affecting the pistol turns and hands ability Stewart that didn't fool anybody as Mike Morgan the outside linebacker 6tier out of USC played for Pete Carroll makes the tackle now let's welcome back to the game Michael Bennett one of the alltime greats you heard Michelle talking about some of the coaches around the National Football League saying if this guy isn't the best defensive player in the league he's darn close coming back from injury hand signals here nobody can hear anybody third and five oh man let's do you know what if that's against well I'll start it's a false story boy that's a dangerous thing you you're keeping the ball alive by throwing the backwards I could have been it although we'll sit puffins the 1300 family well then they blew it did but how in the world whistle he may have heard the whistle but that's still not what you want to make there because the referees not gonna very often make that play not very he's thinking you thought it to me yeah yeah and if he calls a for he would have Perry would have said no play instead of Perry's looking as if the play was still going Perry may not have hurt the was right we fire the showing shed knocking it away Benjamin the intended receiver fortune ten welcome back to Sean shed that's nicely done right here these two match up and a little slant and there you go once again we see it all the time as they walk across underneath and that's Earl Thomas welcome back as well from the hamstring injury and they said maybe not I'll bring that in here at Thomas missed his first game of his career last week after six and a half seasons so walk it is back Palardy his second and he does the kicked flag down for the moment the ball would be at the 5yard line and we will get the decision in a moment there's a little action going on after the fact it looked like one of the Carolina players may have taken a shot play personal foul kicking team number 14 15 yard penalty first in town that is Joe Webb so that gives them a lot more breathing space for Seattle when they pull when we go back all right here is what we've learned in terms of that first play mystery we understand that Newton broke a minor team rule and Rivera felt he had to have some disciplinary action too turned out to be missing the first play of the game and that was disastrous for Carolina B's that wound up as an interception and led to three points but that's what we are hearing and the shell will talk to Rivera as he walks off the field at halftime and he'll get confirmation so on the sidelines so they 6 yard game therefore Jermaine Kearse you all let's go back to the personal foul let's took the ball from the 5 up to the 20 on Joe Webb there's Joe Webb number 14 right there little faint of a blow there and then KJ right right after him and Webb leads with the helmet the officials right there and gets him out of a hole now checking down the three with the ball up at the 20 yard line to get stuffed at the xxx setting up a third down and one we want short leading the charge that time third down they want short right here one of the better players in the National Football League went to the Pro Bowl a year ago with 11 sacks just three sacks this year I think due in part anyway to the fact that and they just simply haven't been playing with leads like they were last year not quite the same number but he gets the pass away and already a big night for Lockett who takes it out to the 39 yard line you had Leonard Johnson coming in from the corner forcing Wilson to get it away but Lockett gets free and they move the chains here's some of the plays that they didn't do with Russell Wilson in the early part of the season because he had all these different kinds of lower body injuries and now we're starting to see him take off and run with the football we're seeing the bootleg stuff back we're seeing the scrambles once again the offbalance throws and all of a sudden Darrell Bevell feels good about offensive coordinator sends in a first halfway here from the 39 yard line next quarter that's locked it again not a locket beam of about seven James Bradbury rookie quarter member of the the Panthers Josh Norman they franchised him and then they couldn't come to a longterm agreement with him let him go let him out the door please not for Washington and they had a draft corners one and two in the draft in April and five so they drafted in three corners in the first five picks and those young Porter's are given a lot of room on the outside and I said I think I'll take it that's what one of the reasons Carolina is 29th in pass defense this year Ross fighting his way to the 41 yard line what a run that's going to take us to the end of the quarter rolls 12 yards there has already rushed for 34 and at the end of the quarter it's 10 to nothing Seattle and Sunday Night Football resumed after these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by Geico Space Needle Seattle Washington on this Sunday night now Michaels with Cris Collinsworth in the show to FOIA and to the southern edge of downtown CenturyLink Field 10 to nothing Seattle on the move again at the 41 yard line they out gained as you can see Carolina 133 to 42 and begin to set the corner of the first out of the 41 yard line Reba Kentucky will sit for his first an 497 the outside of the Sun he will get stuck let's take a look at this playoff picture now in the NFC you've got Dallas 11 straight wins they have clinched a playoff for it and obviously in great shape in terms of trying to get that road to the Super Bowl to go through Dallas Seattle seven three and one Detroit wins again so they are eight and for Atlanta loses but they're leading in the South right now the wild cards would be the Giants and Tampa Bay and all of those other teams are still in the hunt and that is George fanti rookie left tackle who is down and we'll be back after this this week to be Fallon welcoming an array of outstanding guests including the Pharrell Williams he'll be there Edward Norton big football San drop spike Tonight Show with Jimmy I'm looking at my window last night about 11 o'clock and who was on that ferriswheel Chris and Holly Collins were Miss Holly decides that we're going on the ferris wheel we're going on the ferris wheel yep it's quite a sight though it really was that's it's terrific City there's Fayette they working on him walks up under his own power he's missed a few plays in the last couple of weeks with the bad shoulder and watch him at the end of this place or to grab that shoulder and obviously uncomfortable and the beat goes on for this offensive line well without down Musso Diablo rookie I left denry Gillian was mainly an active day so the makeshift line on second and ten has called out the plateau picks up about five AJ Kline makes an attack you know we looked at that playoff picture keresh even though the Panthers are four and seven they were three eight in one a couple of years ago made it to the playoffs wanted playoff game if they can win tonight they'd be two back of Atlanta they still have Atlanta in Tampa Bay to come so nd they're gonna rough day for that division today right except for Tampa and everything seems to be going well now all I got to do is come back from a tenpoint deficit here get back in it on the road but last year that came from being on I want a thriller during the regular season and beat the Seahawks in the it's changed the pass is incomplete right through the hands of manner McAvoy would have had the first down instead is fourth down started with a big diamond formation off to the right and so no surprise here that Russell Wilson is going to go that way and really makes a great throw on to run just unable to make the play looks like they're going to go for here at least try a little hard count on fourth down at the 36 yard line so passing up an opportunity for it won't be a 54yard field at least four than evidence work man indeed we'll go for it and Wilson is under pressure and he's going to get sacked back at the 46 yard line Charles Johnson really having a good year and pays the price here to the tenth year man out of Georgia been there since oh seven and having a really terrific season but now Charles Johnson is the injured Panther Charles Johnson got the sack but he comes back to the bench here's what happened Johnson goes right around the newcomer here Reese Odhiambo to come up with a sack kind of hard to tell what happened to him but Pete Carroll was over on the sideline thinking he not yet nice break for the Panthers again it near midfield start from the 46 Stewart was almost tackled in the backfield and then loses the ball of the 50 yard line and the Seahawks are right there to recovery so Stewart almost into the backfield wrestles his way forward gives it up at the 50yard line it's Marsh comes away with the ball second turnover for Carolina Richard Sherman's going to come in and get this net on the ball but it's KJ right from behind just as Stuart was getting going a second time and it looked like Ted Ginn had a chance to make that block and maybe a big play down the field for this Carolina Panthers offense he failed on the block and then everything fell apart so the nose of the ball right at the midfield stripe so an interception and a fumble turnovers midfield he's going to get sat on backtoback offensive plays so Wilson that time with Kony Ealy he of the spectacular Super Bowl performance last February it's the sack now they're getting pressure from both sides now you come over here against there's fam back in the ball game now and then Kony Ealy from the other side but really that was much more of a sack based on coverage down the field it's one of the things that Carolina's trying to do with this defense trying to make Russell Wilson hold it long enough for this one for to take advantage of their banged up offensive line that they think they came 2nd of 16 that's their top receiver and Doug Baldwin gets taken down third and long you're seeing essentially the same kind of style of play calling now from both coaching staffs both of them know they have big issues trying to block the defensive line of the other team so you're seeing some motion you're seeing some misdirection you're seeing some quarterback roll out get the ball out of your hands quickly and this tenpoint lead is starting to look a little bigger all the time third and the team down the gorge farmer in the game Misha keep him in the block picked off at the 45 tre Boston the safe feet to the 48 of Seattle so after the turnover on the fumble by Stuart Carolina gets it back and they'll have the ball on the plus side of the 50 watch Boston as he go up here this safety they call that a lurk coverage for a robber and it's exactly what he did he just came up and robbed one that time from Russell Wilson who never saw him coming into that coverage guarantee a Russell Wilson about five yards after he released that ball knew he had made a big mistake so a bit of comedy of errors here back and forth at the midfield stripe and Cam Newton with another opportunity suspect that Russell Wilson s4 on this season Boston's second interception the 2016 so 10 to nothing 11:58 to the hand Carolina begins this Drive at the 48yard line teachers pass that Stewart collects flag comes into the end of the play Bobby whacker but a linebacker makes the tackle what KJ right almost had about a 50yard touchdown on that one he just barely missed Allen illegal block in the back offense number 74 10yard penalty replay first down left tackle my Kremers JJ right saw this all the way number 50 and just slides right out in front of it and Kim just wide enough to get it around and right at the tail end as Rimmer's with the block in the back makes it first and 20 now who has three and six the 24yard so he the children ship at the 45 Jonathan Stewart these guys came into the league to two quarterbacks a year apart came from one overall pick and of course Russell picked in the third round the disparity right there Wilson the shortest quarterback the listen when the first four meetings between these two teams Dan the end fifteen of course Russell was there to Ho HD Lombardi Trophy at the Meadowlands when they beat Denver in thirteen thirty seconds away from my second rule avoid for wasn't me second down in 17 from the 45 play clock of the one that's almost intercepted Thomas when again we already had at Thomas's hurt we missed last week's game with a hamstring issue and gets up very gingerly here and that is big news because Earl Thomas my ass the patient one of the best safeties in all of football just reading Cam Newton's eyes as he looked back Earl Thomas was off but this is a guy who very much the heart and soul of this defense doesn't say a whole lot but he is the guy that can just fly sideline to sideline and make plays and that is not a good sight you know the Legion of boom all gathering around all the DBS very concerned obviously coming off the injury missing his first game last week back after this well there's Thomas grimacing on the bench is what happened it looked like kam chancellor flying for that ball as well they collide in midair just don't know area is coming off we saw a moment ago on the sidelines try and stand up and just sat back down and shook his head Stephen taro comes in to replace him he spells in last week in the Tampa Bay game now it's third and 17 threeman rush the keep down feel is caught will it touchdown bye dad gear so they go deep downfield Travis out of the game and right off the bat they go after the guy that replaces him and Ted Ginn who had not scored a touchdown until a couple of weeks ago now has his third in the last three games unbelievable this is a Tampa two with a middle linebacker here I'm just going to draw this because ordinarily they would be much closer they expect the middle linebacker in this prevent kind of style to be able to cover basically down the middle of the field so they wide no safeties just a bit and Earl Thomas goes out for a play and they hit a huge one to Ted amazing great job by Cam Newton understanding somebody cold is coming in off the bench and the take advantage was the Indians own it was close and there is a site that nobody in this ball park wants to see right now is Thomas gets the cart ride back to the locker room of course all scoring plays are reviewed and it's confirmed now that it is a touchdown for Ginn Ted Ginn has just been redhot lately had an 88yard touchdown pass last week yep and this one good for 55 on a third and 17 and Graham Cano now for the extra point to turn it into a threepoint game ten and a half remaining in the opening half one thing about can dude you will let it fly 12% of his passes to targets more than 20 yards downfield that's the third highest rate in the league the average beyond the line of scrimmage that a catch is made at almost eight yards and you can make that add one to that right now six pass touchdowns over 30 yards downfield and we've got a like Ted Ginn you got a real good shot every time you launch one and this one right down the middle for a home run well and what I love that Cam Newton did there is he put plenty of air underneath that ball when you throw it that high it just allows the receiver a little bit of time to try and make an adjustment in the air now Stephen Terrill played really well a week ago made plays on deep balls all over the park but give credit to Cam Newton understanding the guys probably over there maybe he chased the kickoff or two but probably not completely loosened up went right after him came up with a big one right and you saw terrible plays on special teams Graham Deneau always a threat and it's Gunawan southwester after a really good run back of 45 yards well there's a reason that Lockett went to the Pro Bowl last year as a return guy and you saw a bit of a flash of it there he's had a few injury problems this year his knee injuries slowed him down but recently he has been more and more involved in the offense and gave his team a spark after that letdown on third down you just don't see a prevent defense give up a bomb like that very often block the sword he caught three passes for 57 yards tonight as the run back here sets him up in the 43 yard rose fights his leg for a first down gain 212 gets about five of those yards after contact broke away from Shaq Thompson first down his inside zone play and we're gonna go right here with Marc Lewinsky just driving down and then you have the kickout block coming across by Nick bayonet the rookie and that's the same play they scored the touchdown on if you see some of the tightness there of Rawls as well side walls inside the 30 inside the 10 stocks down Seattle Thomas Rawls that's 45 yards and into the end zone his second touchdown of the night what's Thomas Davis right in the middle of this thing just knows he's coming right up and so is it a room right around there for the touchdown I mean this is that is a left roll that completely pulled everybody on the defense and that's some of the quickness that we saw in practice a year ago and now here he goes again Marshawn Lynch is missed but this guy was the leading rusher a season ago Lynch was turned around last year Rawls got hurt toward the end of the year the editor of Kristen Michael who played here a lot before they let him go again and Rawls already tonight 91 yards on line carries was a free agent played his college ball at Central Michigan pounced good for the point after him and so that newton bomb gets very quickly answers run back and then it was Rawls to the end zone and it's 17 7 well that's the matchup on Thursday Night Football here on NBC Oakland and Kansas City somebody here's a great rivalry it's been dormant of late but now back in full force Raiders winning again today beating Buffalo coming from behind Kansas City of thrilling 1 against Atlanta Eric Berry returning an interception of what could have been a twopoint conversion and that was the difference in the game winner in the first place in the AFC u.s. the Thursday night open against Kansas City let's go to Michelle well some injury updates Seattle safety Earl Thomas went back to the xray room he's officially questionable with a left lower leg injury and we can tell you he was unable to put any weight on that leg at all on the sidelines as you guys saw and as he went back to the xray room and for the Panthers defensive end Charles Johnson is questionable with a hamstring injury they wrapped up that left leg so we've indicated that it is the left hamstring guys I thank you Michelle Johnson hurt on the play in which he was able to sack Wilson there he is work through it on a sideline as the Panthers come out and start this drive from their own 25yard line fortyfour left in the hand Seahawks up on ten with protection masses then thought war which should be with forward progress a first down by Kelvin Benjamin for the Legion of boom in all three play their five and one allowing fifteen and a half points per game seven six but you've had chance for missing some time Thomas missing some time and when they miss one guy there two two and one and that one was that 6 6 tie on Sunday night football against Arizona when the 36 they toss a cactus Stewart taken down from behind it just about the line of scrimmage chased down by Michael Bennett sucking down you know one thing we haven't mentioned yet is that Richard Sherman sent out a little bit of practice the other day with a wrist injury so I'm sure that he's not quite as willing to be as physical up on the line of scrimmage you can see the brace on that left wrist of his and basically tonight we have seen a lot of DeSean shed going up against Kelvin Benjamin so maybe that has something to do with it yeah don't forget earlier this season can't chance it was out for about a month with they cockatoo Newton s to take the time out they snap it but he called he called the timeout in time so Cam Newton we talked about the beginning of the game word is a minor team rule was broken and Michelle will walk off the field with him as she does it half time to talk to the coaches and get further clarification or elaboration take a look at the two quarterbacks tonight well 55 of those 93 yards for Newton came on that third and 17 play 99 yards through the air for Wilson and 91 yards on the ground for rolls you know it's interesting out that last year at this time and twentyfour scramble plays of the year this year at the same point the season just three so it's been a very different style this year out of kambou and greatly reducing the touchdown rise down yell this crowd second down 10 after the timeout doesn't anybody and tensioner right there at the line of scrimmage safety playing the role a linebacker to knock them down third down there we go kam chancellor back in there if I'm not mistaken that eighth guy down in the box and so many times teams have everybody block and they can't get the hip third and ten blitz coming they picked it up in the pass is too high and incomplete intended for Benjamin Jeremy Lane with the coverage and halfway through the quarter now it's fourth and ten yeah they need to get that one out just a little bit quicker you have to give this offensive line a little credit that protection was very good against the Blitz but you could see the cam just waiting and waiting and waiting and you get that man coverage get to the first down marker and get your head around Palardy comes in this will be his third feel that the 15 locket Pisan runs up to the 25 728 left in the half and a ten point game in Seattle something I football brought to you by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL subway from the Reuben stack with hornbeam limited time only by Toyota let's go places and buy nationwide nationwide is on your side Seattle person big aircraft city area many many years bowing the Museum of Flight us has the aircraft spacecraft and other artifacts since 65 and that's Boeing Field about a 10minute ride just south of the airport another 15 minutes then the rover BC tack International look at this guy go again to the 38yard line and he's already over 100 tonight a stunningly good night tonight for this offensive line George vant the former basketball player now playing tackle for the nice play Marc Lewinsky probably the secondbest offensive lineman up there and there's the best offensive lineman Justin print the center missed last week and it really left the state of confusion and no confusion out top cable taking a right into left for Pete Carroll that's his offensive line coach these that they play better than that they have a Scott Graham with Davis sheds him and then gets tackled at the 50 yard line by Griffin so another first down backtoback first downs gained 13 there's a little history out here between these guys you'll get grant coming across the formation Thomas Davis in coverage after the play there was a little bit extra it dates back to the days when Jimmy Graham was in New Orleans and of course Thomas Davis in Carolina that's we'll just keep an eye on it they see each other twice a season now boys have a shot there the line of scrimmage in this Davison trade Boston converging yeah Thomas Davis that time said I'm gonna wait for you right here in the hole and he bounces right back into and takes a headshot right back everybody on the defense happy to see that guy going backwards for once Thomas Davis he's amazing three major surgeries 12th airplane as well as ever we were kind of thought about this yesterday he's the kind of guy is it is it a Hall of Fame career well you know what he's going to be certainly considered it second down the level and that pass is caught all the way to the 30 yard line by Nick van eck the rookie tight end out of Ohio State and that's a gain of 21 yards and already 222 yards of offense for Seattle what a play by Russell Wilson watch him with the head fake out there and it's going to open up the seam coming right back inside so when the linebackers react trying to go out and get to that quick screen on the outside it opens up the tight end right down the seam Russell Wilson saw it all the way and upfront John Perry will so signal it all start offense number 78 fiveyard penalty first out just to finish the thought on Thomas day we started by the guy in the Hall of Fame 12 years you know there's Luke Kuechly and I think what I said yesterday in the meeting I believe a thousand percent if Thomas Davis was playing in New York right his career he'd definitely be the whole thing well if you take what he's done off the field Walter Payton Man of the Year he probably gets in without a doubt just one of those guys that loves the game of football it's his first camera he gets chased out of bounds is a rookie out of Jacksonville State free agent Thomas Davis for talking about three ACL surgeries he had 11 sacks before he was 30 and then he found the Fountain of Youth 14 cents there's really not a whole lot in the National Football League a lot more fun than watching Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly play side by side they go sideline to sideline about his past as any pair of linebackers I've ever seen poke going for gain of about to Vernon Butler who was their number one pick last year I think I said the two corners were one two there were two three but Butler was the number one pick as they went defense in the draft interesting to see Tremayne hope in the ball game I was asking some of the coaches about him and they called him a rushing sivanna's is that that one of the most natural runners of the football we have never seen we just had to get him in the game find out what he can do of what they've seen for them on the other hand are broadcasting survived the 3rd and 7 and Wilson's going to take off pick up the first down so Russell Wilson not on the injury report for the first time since opening day and he looks like it remember that Arizona game we did that six six game and we just didn't see any of this sort of stuff out of Russell Wilson he had so many injuries he was dealing with and now he just is back to breaking down defenses in these key moments he really runs more to throw then to one he always has his head up and his eyes downfield but when they need a big play and deliver it with his legs now watching the bench is second in the league well it looked like it there that really haven't looked like it very much tonight 103 yards pulp gets taken back here loss of 1 second and 11 now that's really been a bit of the startling part of this game for me I thought that we were going to see a dominant performance out of the defensive line of the Carolina Panthers you talked about it the number one Russian defense coming into this game and yet it's been the rushing so far of Thomas Rawls it's been the protection of this offensive line and the movement of Russell Wilson that's been the difference and that takes us to the twominute warning with Seattle leading Carolina's 17 to 7 coming up two at a halftime Eric Berry returns two interceptions four points Chiefs beat the Falcons Bucs win their fourth straight tied with Atlantic the top spot in the south Mike Tirico looking ahead to the big game that will have for you on Thursday night we can Torche bombers now the back here on second and rub and Wilson chase out of the pocket but still danger the engine intended for Jimmy Graham they're down and how did Russell Wilson escape dad that was just a jailbreak coming from every direction and it looked like he was had they were coming at him three different ways and he escapes out of there and fires one of those offbalance balls that just ended up missing but I think the big thing the big difference tonight out is Russell Wilson's ability to go to some of those playaction passes he is tremendous in playaction second breakin the entire NFL of the 128th quarterback rating and they just haven't been able to use it much because they haven't been running the ball this year until the tonight Thomas Rawls has done a magnificent job and then a stream incomplete farmer who had come in the second year guy out of USC that would be their number three running back coming into the game and his fourth down yeah go figure George farmer who was the number one rated wide receiver coming out of high school recruited by absolutely everybody ahead of Odell Beckham and others comes in and drops that ball so now that means haschke will attempt a 37yard field goal earlier than 23 the middle 1:45 remaining in the opening half inch yet old extended sleeve the 13 well it's called the night to love to hate NBCSN hockey Wednesday night he got Savina Chara and the Bruins Alex Ovechkin and capitals Boston against Washington 7:00 Eastern NBC SN DNA trill and Paul Allen the longtime owner of the Seahawks also owns the Portland Trailblazers of the National Basketball Association shockingly with a computer in front of it it's reflux has made his fortune at Microsoft along with Bill Gates in the early years rather play humble guy I better hit that very good man and always enjoyed speaking with him I mean when you're a billionaire you own a team and you're walking around with a big credential on your neck that's humbled you might be like when John Madden was coaching in the credentials hanging from this was dope Luke there was a fashion statement regarding the Seattle defense you go back to 2012 allowing just the tech under 16 points per game that's 30% below the league average compared to the Bears back 84 through 88 of course of great 46 defense buddy Ryan and the rest they were 32 percent below the league average and it's just amazingly they have a real good chance to wind up for the fifth year in a row allowing the fewest points in the league also hurry up they admit it but it's important to them too so they started out in 225 incomplete we check in with Michelle we told you that Seahawks safety Earl Thomas is questionable with a left lower leg injury that he went back to get xrays he left the xray room on crutches no change to his status of questionable also running back Thomas Rawls just went back to the locker room accompanied by the UNC which means he is in the concussion protocol Allen yeah Michelle we're taking a look at that replay and you can see right there he reached for his head as he took that shot going through the little of the line so two very significant easily second Adam at the 25yard line and under pressure fires incomplete in at Benjamin there the pressure put on by Frank Clark third thing this is a pretty big drive for Carolina Beach didn't leave Seattle the ball back if they don't convert here enough time and then Seattle is going to get the ball to start the second half as well Frank Clarke's having a conversation a long one with Cam Newton that time they put Frank Clark michael bennet down inside at the defensive tackle positions of ran a Ross for this makeshift off Carolina you don't want to see those two guys inside right there good luck third and ten that play clock goes to zero and I'm not sure he got Robbie as I see a flag thrown at the line of scrimmage so loud nobody can hear anything here get the call from John Perry in a second mr. panic of salvation offense number 70 was not on the line scrimmage has been declined fourth down that's Trey Turner and they're gonna kick Trey Turner who ordinarily is a guard having to bump out to tackle said I need a little help if I'm gonna block these guys coming off the edge over here step back behind the line of scrimmage he's got to break the belt line right there and just behind that yep it'd have at least seven up on the line the warning since locked it to the side one man to the 35 you had a penalty all the way back up at the 37 yard line and might have a running into the kicker here during the kick hold ain't no return team number 58 10yard penalty first down oops it was certainly not running in the kickboard shut up he initially had indicated well order your holiday gifts from NFL Shop calm and save 25% off the official story in the film NFL shop.com how was that ferriswheel last night bed ride spectacular I mean it really was it was a lot of fun and wish you have the Space Needle you have all those other things and well know you feel like a kid again you're going up around and circling around taking some pictures you're not a kid anymore now you should have seen me that was social media I look like a kid I'm sending down whatever there's other things why do you do that don't show my kids tell me it's important that's right you know you need a nom de plume is what you need you know that is you went to Florida right yeah okay after halftime okay was at the 15yard line six let's poke so with Rawls back in the concussion protocol and I ain't got to go with Pope and with farmer as the other backs CJ Prosise who done a great job he's Bert he's unavailable caught up at the 30yard line Golemon stays in bounds before getting shut that he's their number one pick he and Wilson really have something special going in half four years and they got a panther who needs extra time and getting up twice mr. dare that was some shot by Jermaine Kearse at the tail end of that plane making Worley leave the game the rookie corner out of West Virginia official came over and said you gotta go to the bench for at least one play mcclain comes any single and one good amount of action tonight coming right off the back end there never saw it coming train curse and he took a look around at the official make sure they weren't gonna throw a flag on that sometimes they can catch you for going back towards your own line of scrimmage get helmet to helmet or around the head she took the end of there 40 gram makes the catch and gets taken down at the 42 yard line by Michael Griffin timeout a 30second timeout back in half a minute well that's quite a sight isn't it CenturyLink Field it opened in 2002 well the way they picked this stadium it's portative they have to Crane to see over the people of fire boys let's mean highpitched sound stays in here fortytwo Wilson running for a first down and a lot more than slides through a stack of the twentythree and says I'll take a timeout right here I'm at sea animal back in 30 seconds so with Rawls the only experience back back in concussion protocol again pulp ten career yards farmer is zero that's what's left in the running artful for see ya fires first and still going picks up the first that gets to the 14 yard line and Seattle takes its final timeout so they have 26 seconds and they're at the 13 yard line and the Seattle Seahawks tonight and have already gained 309 yards can I tell you something sure Russell Wilson has been unbelievable on this Drive he's throwing rockets he's moving around we're seeing the russell wilson who has carried this team to Super Bowls in the past and of course Marshawn Lynch a lot of other people Doug Baldwin get credit this defense and all that but this is the russell wilson that we have seen at his best on display in this drive this drive five plays one rush does his four passes started at the 15 yard line there was the running back three receivers set to the right side he has trouble with his snack and that's incomplete the curse was in the area and now they're down to 21 seconds on a second down even that window I mean you're gonna see immediate pressure from brian de l'air coming off his right side and just ducks out of the way of it and instead of taking the sack and a negative play it ends up being no gain here comes the pressure this way and watch him bobble the ball just sort of gently duck underneath it and throw that thing away sometimes some of the best plays are the ones that go for no yards second and ten away open I'm throwing then the down the middle of the field here at this point especially in a third third down I mean he's got to go to the sidelines or the endzone now you have no time to spike it check out your main he fed he come right back here and once again is the layer comes around and face gonna say not this time not against that quarterback we're going back to the Super Bowl we need to keep him upright and they're doing a pretty good job of that here tonight that's too deep Graham the intended receiver the coverage was very good by Worley and that old mean house go will come in to try to make his third field goal of the game now we've seen Jimmy Graham make this one hander before sort of holding off with one hand and going one hand he should have gone rebounder on this one he should have gone back up through Darryl Worley and made that play he was a college basketball player that's one that take two hands snatch a rebound might have a touchdown 31yard attempt and his kick is good so he is accounted for three field goals two extra points and is twenty three to seven so next Sunday night NFC's classic the way it's turned out Cowboys 11 straight Annabelle's best record head to the Meadowlands to take on the Giants the only team to beat them this year Cowboys Giants next week on Sunday Night Football I don't think we're flexing out of that game what do you think I don't think so we have some great games coming out this week for sure yep there's the night is Oakland KC and then Sunday night the jinks and the boys I just keep thinking about the Kansas City Chiefs and they don't always blow people away but but the way they've got that defense set now you know Eric Berry making news plays Justin Houston Marcus Peters and now that offense perking up just a little bit they have won a lot of football games lately and how about the rule change couple years ago where if you run back a conversion you get two points it costs New Orleans a game against Denver earlier and it costs Atlanta a game against Kansas City today you know that's such a bizarre position to be in when you're up one you basically have to go 42 to try it but boy it sure flipped around on him today and that AFC West is something Raiders with another comeback today after they've fallen well behind the Buffalo Bills and the Denver Broncos back on the running track at Jacksonville looking for something special that it wasn't there and that's gonna take us to halftime the animal is going to get the ball and we start the second habits 23 to 7 home team coming up next turn a halftime after these messages from your local NBC's tonight's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by Chevrolet they started with Derrick Anderson and the paces intercepted this is just a bizarre start to this game deep downfield and touchdown Seattle Chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row bad back we come to Seattle score is twenty three to seven Seahawks at the start of the third quarter Cam Newton 93 yards passing 55 coming on that one play Russell Wilson good first half through the air and on the ground Thomas Rawls 103 rushing yards in the first half most by a Seahawks running backs in Sean Alexander a decade ago and we will get a report very shortly from Michelle on Pearl Thomas who left the game in the second quarter Al Michaels with Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya 237 Carolina's last week trailed Oakland 247 be back to take the lead before the waiter pulled out the win at the end and let's go right to the show well I confirmed with Ron Rivera at halftime the Cam Newton was held out of that first play because of a dress code violation and Rivera told me he has no regrets about letting Derrick Anderson throw the ball which resulted in a pick instead of just handing off now for Earl Thomas we told you in the second quarter he left the game got xrays we saw him on crutches I just confirmed with Pete Carroll that he has a cracked tibia in that left leg that's the shin bone and at halftime Earl Thomas sent out a tweet and we'll give you a look at it and read it to you he said this game has been so good to me no regrets a lot is running through my mind including retirement thanks for all the prayers oh wow that is that is some tweet for a guy who had this happened to him in the second quarter he had a streak of a hundred and six straight games broken when he missed that game last week six my fact he gets hurt here so he is not used to being injured right lock it and he says we think in bounds and if he didn't step out of bank somewhere along the line he has gone all the way to the end zone tidal locking that would be 75 yards skirts the sideline in front of the cat line effect I don't see anybody over there pointing to any chalk or anything because it's a story play so it gets reviewed they're looking at it right now looks like he's in all the way if I were in the NFC right now I'd be thinking uhoh Seattle Seahawks are looking a whole bunch like the Seattle Seahawks these guys are getting healthy lockets getting healthy Russell Wilson's getting healthy and even those two backup tight ends Brandon Williams and Nick Van net made huge blocks there yeah they're getting healthy on the offensive side but it's the defensive side they have to be concerned about especially with the Thomas situation that's like its first TD of the season Luke Kuechly he can only look on Sony concussion protocol as his team right now is going to be down by 2030 after this extra point so that takes 12 seconds to start the third quarter and it's 32 7 and for Charles Johnson right out there remember had that hamstring energy's he tried but that injury just would not let him move at all and so basically you're playing with 10 i'm tyler lockett made up a the Carolina defense I'm talking about in terms of rushing they were second the lead coming into the game is te a lot of frustration right there right now and they have already given up 213 rushing yards tonight and I guarantee you if Luke Kuechly was that mad he was mad about either effort or somebody who shouldn't have been on the field at that time but he was not happy crows Johnson sidelines and welded for the Carolina Panthers we started the night by saying last year was a dream season this one is a bad dream well and we go back to again Kirk Coleman the defensive signal caller Luke Kuechly the defensive signal caller and Mario Addison the leading sacker all out and Luke Kuechly looks like he's ready to grab a helmet right now that is his defense out there all those proud numbers that they put up to watch it get gouge like this is not fun Ron Rivera his pedigree is defense great linebacker his years worked under remember these good head coaches found in the end zone here for a touchback in back would go to the TD checkout Thomas Davis here is see Tyler Lockett fly around the edge Davis thought that maybe you had already had stepped out and he took a hesitation step unlike him tyler lockett can be such a difference maker we've seen him really pick apart this cut team tonight of the Carolina Panthers and now he's doing the same thing on offense and one of those guys he gets his hand on the ball then you can see what what can happen even 175 yards you can run kicks back three receivers set to the left and then they break that Whitaker taking the Tosh and Bobby Wagner lock them down ground after a gain of three second down and seven this is one play by the Carolina Panthers offense on third and a million which Kara Seattle's defense never gives up or this would be really embarrassing for what Carolina's done out here tonight this has not been much of a performance I know they're hurt their offensive lines and mass now their defense and guys but it's just hard to imagine this is a team that went to the Super Bowl on 15 and won 55 of those 118 yards Nutan under pressure enough pains dinner and slide to a stop up at the 39 yard line for a Carolina first down they're working every different way to help this offensive line at Dixon on the outside basically having to block I think that was Frank Clark that time right over here these two and it's one thing if a backs going to help in some way for a tight end but Cam Newton knew that was a mismatch this Frank Clark is really becoming a player for Seattle as well seven half sacks on the year the 49yard line by Greg Olson Greg Olson 10th year in the league started in Chicago then the trade which turned out to be fantastic for these guys before it's all said and done his numbers will be up among the best ever for tight ends he's been a terrific player and great guy in the community as well yeah 790 yards coming in led the National Football League for tied in second Jimmy Graham on the other side juggle and this is silly Brown korie's his given name and he gets dropped behind the line of scrimmage so you're gonna see a little bit of the sort of triple option here and you're gonna have on the outside there's kam chancellor playing against Cam Newton but there are two guys sitting on the pitch outside and Willie Brown pride game oh thanks a lot second and 13 having a diamond formation the play day we've wanted to go long now he's got to spin around that's the settle for short is Greg Olson making the catch taking that a bathroom to feel yeah you know we talked about it going the other way but this makes shift carolina's offensive lines been doing a pretty nice job here as well that's all the protection need they tried to hit Philly brown on a swing route up the sideline but it was Jeremy Lane who was all over that took it away nowhere for cam to go and it was up to to just scramble around and third and 11 is past that's spinning around and trying to get that first down his kin very close and looks as if they will give it to him interesting cuz he kind of did a hook slide out of bounds did the ball get to that first down marker or did his feet get gonna look right here so the ball is in the right hand feet got across the line those are the official sticks right there did the ball ever get across the line I'm not sure it did and of course that's one of these things that could be challenged meanwhile you got Turner taking a knee down there he needs a little bit of attention Cam Newton may need a little bit of attention if he loses another offensive lineman I've never seen anything there are no tackles left in the league how many times we've talked about tackles the ball looks like he was short it was ruled initially a first down on the field and they given her a first down if that could be challenged the spot to be challenged see Carol challenging this course definitely say that a public challenge having a conversation yep meanwhile we we have to address what Michelle was talking about that new key missed the first play of the gate for a wardrobe violation of all the guys in the league have a wardrobe file so what he did not wear a tie on the plane or something I'm glad NBC doesn't have that you and I would miss every opening but I came nude when you see them in the press conferences this guy's got like 18,000 giddy ups to get up so what every corner more sometimes and now from the 41 yard line here is Jonathan Stewart to the 38 yard line second down and seven now there's just what is fashioned for somebody Cam Newton's age and what is fashioned for somebody Ron Rivera's age sometimes two completely different things and hardheaded guys believe that they're right the coach ultimately had to say now if you missed it earlier Newton was benched for the first play of the game he had Derek Anderson started the game and wouldn't you know it he took an interception in Seattle is often wine with a field goal and they've never looked back all over the place and in all over the place and in completing that Sherman is down and for the moment a few hearts stopped in this building with Thomas already out Sherman look through the moment as if he might have a problem it doesn't thirddown Richard Sherman's problem is he didn't get that interception that was a nice play going up this way by Kelvin Benjamin just to knock it away I think at the last second from Richard Sherman or at least distract him as it was coming down nothing Richard Sherman likes better than those freebies like that third and eight here comes the Blitz Newton gets it away as he could contact and intended for Browns incomplete pressure put on by a virile Sherman covers on the play for them you know Richard Sherman this year has had to follow a lot of really top in receivers I remember the battle against Julio Jones Mike Evans some of those guys and it's probably hurt some of his numbers this year because he hasn't just been playing that traditional side that he's always on but by doing that following the top receivers really helped this football team thirty saddle called a 30second timeout back to Sherman here now there were just three games this year in which he tracked a single wide receiver and you can see that those have been the games that he's given up the three touchdowns he does have the two interceptions but over here when he just plays his traditional left side no touchdowns whatsoever and the opposer passing rating of a 59 in sight and I think he's still learning how to do that I think he's still learning how to play in the slot and on the other side and he's still the best option they have focus as lock it makes the fair catch at the 10yard line 1008 left in the third Seattle up 30 December Sunday Night Football being brought to you by Southwest gets to low fares with nothing to hide that's transparency by Amazon Prime get free twoday shipping on millions of items buy the new Volkswagen Golf all track with 4motion allwheel drive and by DIRECTV McCoy some sports man have you got to get DIRECTV understand of the tacoma dong south of here the other night the combine can braise on their first state championship people day is pulled in overtime Seahawks not from the 10yard line they start this Drive will they hand off here walls is back so he past that concussion protocol had a big first half he was up he was up in over a hundred yards but now with a couple losses in his last couple of carries he's back down to 99 that I have I like his eyes good back meat scoop and I like we had a game earlier this year I don't somebody went over a hundred then they went back to nineteen I forget who it was this right Corvettes running for the close we did that game to check in at 13 and that's going on here buddy it's one out of bounds look at the 11yard line be third down I kind of enjoy watching Jimmy Graham on this offense occasionally get down in there and block you know you don't come to Seattle and be a part of this football team if you're not willing to do everything and you're gonna go out there and he's are going to be expected to block he's going to be expected to come out and run routes but this is an offense that is a little bit dependent on that guy not just being a receiver for making some plays blocking as well third and nine we'll see surveys your mind first then that's Tanner McEvoy who was targeted earlier in the game and had it go through his hands and this time he's able to hold it in first down working against Robert McClain the backup nickel guy and Tanner McEvoy is an interesting guy Wisconsin he was a wide receiver quarterback a safety he had stats in all kinds of different directions a big target which they don't really have that much of other than Jimmy Graham so maybe throwing it up high and giving him a chance to use that size this is locking in his son he gets pinned it behind the line of scrimmage by Bradbury we go to Michelle well while Thomas Rawls got cleared from the concussion protocol fullback will tukufu is out with a concussion out mmm Michelle thank you so took the laughs ooh blocking back and also playing the other side of the line from time to time talked about the fact that Prosise is hurt he's out for a while so farmer and pauper the guys been at least think it rolls back out here and Doug Baldwin is out of bounds at about the 30yard line we'll make it 36 the Seattle Seahawks are now over 400 yards of total offense in two and a half quarters now Pete Carroll is a little bit of a different kind of coach he likes free spirits he does not reign a man he believes that you want to speak out over a cause or anything else feel free he wants these guys to be individuals in Claudia is he's anything goes it's you know he's the youngest person to lead 65 and we'll see if it's taken down in the 23 not unusual once in a while down in Southern California in the offseason and you're off Manhattan Beach to CP get out on a surfboard that is a fact and here comes Thomas Davis surfing around the outside here and it's going to get a piece of Russell Wilson along with Wes Horton inside so maybe that's the strategy send a few more bodies after him trying to keep him in that pocket that was the goal trying to keep him inside the pocket but off the spot he's been off the spot now and around and beat them though John Ryan to punt of the night and it's out of bounds up at around the 35 yard line 6:15 left in the third Marx by 23 now Jonathan Stewart there is perhaps the next Van Cliburn you never know splits wide to the right here the ball is at the 35yard line is at Din nineyard gain and we go to Michelle well Jonathan Stewart told me his passion for the piano began when he figured out how to play lean on me on a fisherprice xylophone as a little boy but he made his name playing football at Timberline high school about an hour southwest of Seattle and he still holds the state's high school rushing record Stewart said grown up playing football in Washington you dreamed of either playing for the Seahawks or against them to achieve that is definitely at blood cell yeah well he's the seventh time in five seasons that he's played against them he's that easily in the same division and new who goes down that's Ruben who comes in and pressures him to force him to sling it away third one Ron Rivera will be talking to him yesterday and not that he hasn't given up on the season but he's already beginning to think about what they're gonna need to do I mean he's that one eye on the future here just wonder how much the whole Josh Norman take the scale on so I'm with you on that one and this is Stewart and not just curse it's not just the fact they gave up a great defensive back and all that but you wonder about the dynamic you come off a season where you're 15 and 1 you go to the the Super Bowl and everybody was pretty shocked I mean the players were shocked and you know getting rid of Norman for whatever reason the money or whatever or something behind the scenes that you don't know about but that does send shockwaves through a team is no doubt nobody was more shocked than Josh Norman right the minute he got the news he pulled off on the side of the road called Dave gentlemen Paul the owner called everybody like the owner called everybody like ignite I thought I was franchisee I didn't think I could go anywhere he didn't want to go anywhere from the 40 gets it picked off flag is thrown though Terrell with the interception it will see if it stands and the run back as well he's got some blocking he gets knocked down finally at the 30 aren't leavin knew who was in on the play at the end and there's another flag down at the end of the play there's all kinds of stuff on now and one of them was Ted Ginn about did a backflip when somebody hit him KJ Wright was the guy who got in first of all let's see about the flag at the inception of the play during the interception and this one at the very end referee is John Perry officials trying to catch their breath after that when they had to run hundred yards each way all right judge there's two fouls in the play pass interference defense after the change of possession illegal low block quarterback number one by rule will replay the down after all that so you get past interference Seattle and then Newton is the guy who gets the penalty yeah well Cam Newton probably trying to avoid the block there is probably the interference there against Morgan and then Cam Newton on the other end simply did not want to get hit and wasn't like he was going low and there's Ted Ginn getting taken out by KJ right there were bodies flying all over the place on this play and you can see Cam Newton I guess sort of going for the tackle in there and but you're not allowed to go low against the blocker on any sort of turnover play whether you're on offense or defense that's when you get involved he's trying to get out of there while off the 48 back at a person 10 they've been fun to see the six for second year Guyana Michigan his first catch of the game that's what you can do those hard play actions here going against the Shawn shed and punches is a guy that has a lot of ability has some of the same size is Kelvin Benjamin and you kind of hit their best thing one of those teams that look so impressive getting off the bus they can play above the rim but I think out of it without that running game is good this year some of that play off the hands of addiction the number to tighten cannot hold it second down that Dixon doesn't get to run a lot of routes only 34% of his plays actually around he plays this beautifully he just let it sort of fall in over the back shoulder cam Chancellor had no chance Cam Newton with a perfect throw and he just short on to the pick one of those you just Sarris career the Ravens they were Joe Flacco with several seasons second down to ten let's go let's go himself strong the offensive backfield is gonna be against Carolina holding offense number 74 in their penalty replay second down and it's my Kremers let's take a look at this one is fascist Marsh comes around the corner here clearly Marsh goes down was in a holder I guess it looked like you did get inside that shoulder pad just a little bit sometimes you see those where it looks like the guy slips and they still get the holding call because it's such a jerky kind of action but thought he did get him there I don't like for Michael Bennett tonight though has their own I'm sure just working his way back in there lined up offside once second and 20 from the 42 dropping to the ground after making the country's tip Ginn so the third down and long we go right there you'll see been it with a little spin move inside and at his best the guy is a nightmare inside against those guards and different positions I'll never forget the performance he put on in the Super Bowl chasing around Tom Brady their density let's juggle bubble and fold in for a first time by Devin Funchess who had not quote of Nass until this Dr Frank Clark got to Newton as he delivered they come right up there and Hal Cam Newton got this ball and taken the shot that he talked I still don't know perfectly between the 1 and the 7 just the brave throw ball bobbled up in the air floating around and the long arms of Devin Funchess reeled it in his Cam Newton was taken out on the other side for Frank Gore at the 14 in pink we trying to go to the Asian zone that's on Kelvin Benjamin covered oneonone bond to Shan shed second down and I don't think the Shan shed has gotten quite enough credit this season for the job that he's doing remember Richard Sherman's on the other side so everybody is going after you an imposing quarterback rating of 82 very solid play on that side and Richard Sherman able to do his thing against a lot of these numberone receivers because he's gotten that sort of support on the other side second down on the 14 yard line and thus I lose that he's not going to be able to get by Keiji right will envelops him behind the line of scrimmage setting up a third down JJ Wright's just such a smart football player he really is he's going to see this pulling action and he'll just follow in behind it oh that's where you're going okay and here comes Cam Newton sometimes the smartest of the linebackers in the league don't even watch the action going on in the backfield they're watching what those linemen do and then exploding up in the hole to make a play those two are awfully good together and complete before town pontius was the intended receiver with a minute and a half to play in the quarter and you would think down by 23 we'll go for it the touch senators in here to possession remember as a field goal leaves it the origination completed the the flag is strong intended for Benjamin he got Sherman right there and you might have offensive pass interference and that appears to be the case because the Seattle offense is coming out onto the field he had a little fun why not his team is up by 23 a 16 and a half minutes I'm try not to miss the one night only musical event a holiday season featuring an allstar cast it is hairspray and live and you see right here Wednesday night see seattle begins this drive from the sixteen that's Nick Manette making the catch how about this guy former basketball player at Western Kentucky and a good one but watch how he guards he's got his hands out flat right any kind of plays tackle that same way with his hands out like a guy garden and basketball something like that so but it's a difference now he's playing football he has very little experience this is a little closer maybe my Kremers here on the outside watch how he's always fighting to keep those hands inside on the chest plate so you get the feeling that George man he's plenty good enough athlete he's just learning a position broken treason offense number 78 fiveyard penalty second down Brook he did a pretty good job didn't quite play as well in last couple of games but having his moments tonight yep they say everything that George Fant does is the first time in his life attacks you know it just is he faced the great speed rusher and Noah Spence and it you know first have you look terrible and he sort of settles in and but here's the wording urban the athleticism one is good enough to play left that'll offensive line rookie slugging his way with a flag thrown his cursed McLane covering facemask defense number 27 15yard penalty automatic first down and that is mcclain Marshawn Lynch is in the house there is retired after so many good seasons in Seattle making his presence known messing with him a little bit having some fun that I made fun did a little kidney shot there where he is some player that wasn't in holy smokes 32 7 end of three Sunday Night Football resume and to these messages tonight's aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico Elliott Bay funding Seattle spaced it on the background now Michaels with dollar in the show to Koya with 13 Sunday Night Football what a week next week coming up Oakland Kansas City Thursday and Cowboys first down as we start the fourth and this is walls and we go to Michelle you were talking about left tackle George fan you know he told me he was a basketball player through and through he never even considered football until several people inside the Western Kentucky football program convinced him he could become an NFL tight end so fan used his fifth year of eligibility to play football but now he played just 28 stamps in two games none of them on the offensive line Michelle it's amazing and it's also a credit to somebody like John Schneider who's the GM here in Seattle a big go out they can find something like that second down and six Thomas Royal stopped for no gain Tom cable over there to coach him up just a little bit as well so you know there it's what the leak is right now I mean there are guys around the National Football League playing left tackle that probably growing up would have never had any idea but they're looking for big long athletes you can see is a quality basketball player but to step in in the National Football League on a team that has a legitimate shot at going to the Super Bowl and playlist with the little experience he has in this game that's really remarkable third and six that'll be a first I'm Doug Baldwin Baldwin tonight he hasn't made much noise but a few short passes but over the years these two guys are some combo platter I just don't think there's really any body better is a slot receiver inside that Baldwin is and he has some of that Steve Smith stuff to him you know that chip on his shoulder I was never good enough you guys didn't want me the organization actually had to send him a letter that basically told him how much they really did want him and how far it could be too not open spooky game one mr. Halen so after we've caught six for 36 this one deep downfield and he first down on a gain of 34 he'll do a little block inside and then trail mcclain looks at him Robert mcclain and thinking that here's a guy that is just blockings takes a step up and then Baldwin gets right behind them all the little things when you help your team you help them block somehow you always get rewarded but that is one intense competitor on a team that is loaded with a Pete Carroll goes out and he talks about it I just look for guys that want to compete more they want to win more than anybody else out there you can find them on the basketball courts all over New York City I'm not Seahawks Premier League Sunday coming to NBCSN he got the Chelsea West Brom match at 6:30 a.m. Eastern setting it off Sunday you know I'm looking at that guy on the thing and that's when Bill Parcells and say that's why you do all them situps I don't think that's what is he goes it was looking for that cropped off shirt no fireman ed and fat man Fred we got them all out there man all right on a 40degree night meanwhile you've got Kyle love defensive tackle who needs the attention how about that guy how about Michael Bennett hey everything he says to me it's funny he talks about playing against Cam Newton and he said you know there's about 15 guys and the everybody's for the most poor kind of normal then there's like 15 guys that are mutants that cans of mutant if you're playing Madden and you had 99 ratings on everything a football player could do that would be Cam Newton knows of this you can't ask him a question and just get some kind of straight answer Allen got you talk to him about rushing the passer and who's the weak link on the offensive line he said hey I don't go in looking for ducks that's not my job I got to treat them all like they're ducks it goes you can't you go out looking for a duck you're not gonna find a duck you just got to treat them all like dockside and I just not like it makes how much fun was that how so drilling up more fellas all my bras it's almost intercepted and the intended receiver Graham has the one to plan in effect defensive back on James Bradbury now they go right back to the playaction one more time but Bradbury not fooled on this one as Jimmy Graham gets out to the backside just couldn't get quite enough on it it's just still so strange for me to see number 24 James Bradbury instead of Josh Norman out there I find myself having to catch myself all the time he's a good young player physical guys somebody they have third and eight and they hold him out but it's going to be a first down in gold as he drops the mic all those offensive linemen this is their favorite moment it almost happened Jimmy Graham is going to catch it he's fighting for it and these offensive linemen are going to come screaming trying to push him and inside here wow they just couldn't quite get there both of them on the ground but that is what the seattle seahawks just love him Greg Olson seen enough of this show Seahawks a good shot bring it up at least 500 yards of total offense and they take another timeout with eleven twelve to go in the fourth Arrowhead Stadium on a Thursday I would have seen that's going to be NBC will have it for you we'll be there for the Raiders and the Chiefs AFC West coming your way on Thursday Night Football right here National Broadcasting Company so its first and goal walls has two touchdowns tonight on two it's grand for the touchdown it's time which should be gram sic caches and the touchdown michael griffin not really being used to being in this kind of situation he's more the down in the box kind of guy now having to cover one of the great pass receiving tight ends of all time jimmy graham who gives you the reverse spike dunk whatever you want to call that sort of in your face his fifth touchdown catch of the year touchdown pass seventyfive basket bangs it through and with 11 here in Seattle it's the Seahawks 37 the Panther chef Sunday Night Football all being brought to you by Verizon it's always a great gift on Verizon by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance by Chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row and by Samsung pay turn your phone into a wabun it's the wild whites their golden wooden Lyndon Park soon as holiday season for the NBC logo the old one anyway pashka to kickoff 37 to seven as seahawks tonight 472 yards of offense and the Panthers getting 25 and we come back to CenturyLink Field don't want to miss that one a week from tonight we go to MetLife Stadium the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants Cowboys will try to win their 12th in a row the Giants losing to Pittsburgh today trying to pick up their ninth win and stay very much in convention for at least eight wildcard berth that is next Sunday night on Sunday Night Football tell you about the following after this first play the drum Stuart they're flexing in 2d the following week which is the 18th night of December we're back with the Cowboys again as they will take on the redhot Tampa Bay Buccaneers who one foreigner owners tied now for the top spot with Atlanta in the NFC South so that'll be Sunday night two weeks from tonight at Dallas it's always exciting when a new hot team comes flexing into Sunday night football we get it so watch it and they are not called San Diego on and there's a big hole here exploited by Jonathan Stewart all the way to the Seattle 46 yard line being a 29 you've got what is typically a guard coming across here and going to have a trap coming across the formation on the top of Ruben they're sort of an interesting design the guy who typically plays right guard and does all that pulling is uh what the heck of a tackle we're just going to do it from there to work so 47 yards 29 on that one the two yards of Terry prior to that we started to stumble and then just things that one out about second and ten let's talk about this guy Frank Clark because I really do think that this is a guy that has a chance to be a star in this league he still is pretty raw but watch this little loop back inside of a sophisticated blocker and Trey Turner not used to playing tackle as we talked about there Frank Clark seven and a half sacks on the year an outstanding run player and now they mix him in with Cliff April who has ten sacks on the year we all know what my pretty formidable passrush right now we've seen a lot of spin news that was a pretty good one yeah Pendleton couldn't handle it make it third down in ten it's one of the things we haven't seen out of Ted kid here lately is that this guy has figured out a way to become a wide receiver he is making catches and running routes that he didn't used to do much on look at that quickness on the outside that ball supplies in just a bit but he has always been a big playmaker with some of those kick returns but a touchdown was at 55 yarder on the third and 17 in the second quarter behind for lunch this little make it forward down talking about that Seattle schedule the rest of the way at the top talked about the fact they we're not going to meet a team that at the moment has a winning record next week they go to Green Bay they're at 500 Rams come in on a Thursday night we'll have that one on NBC in the 15 Arizona comes in here and then at San Francisco the Rams there was some crazy reason they had Seattle's number beat him earlier this year Pete of all kinds last year like Seattle's chances for I do bound into the end zone yeah I do like the transition a week from Thursday I'm taking it away tonight will be well there's Luke Kuechly for him it has to be so tough you're on the sidelines this is when Lockett ran the 75 yards down the sideline for a touchdown talking to the field judge maybe about throwing a flag or whatever but you know it's got to be very frustrating for that guy and we saw him sustain that concussion against Boykin will come in working out of TCU free agents and he's the guy who backs up Lawson and he will get some working and let's go to Michelle well ah the emotions emanating from Luke Kuechly after that concussion provided one of the most profound moments of this NFL season he told me he has watched replays of the incident and cannot explain why he was crying the way he was he said it's been suggested to him that some brain injuries can cause uncontrollable laughter or tears and he said I hope that's what it was otherwise I just can't explain him yeah it was shocking the show and that's caught by tyler lockett we all thought even the players so we took of a couple of them prior to the game about what they thought had happened and we thought it was a lower body injury at first and it turned out obviously to be the concussion we saw that emotional scene he's in the protocol right now and talked to him before the game and you know he wants the plays a football player and he's hoping to get back next week but but who knows it's up to the people in charge of clearing him and go back and get on the active roster and I thought it was scary to see him in tears like that I thought something happened that he considered to be sort of careerending could quite figure out exactly what it was that kind of football player reduced the tears in that way it was a startling frightening kind of moment for one of Cincinnati's finest that is a guy that on and off the field about as good as they come pulp just picked up the first net Michaux you went away in a little bit more well yeah he said that you know he just he took the hit and couldn't make heads or tails of what happened next as far as coming back just like you said that he loves football I asked if his family is pushing back on that decision at all he said they just want me to be smart yeah and he got walls and his big night keeps on going I'm sorry it was they said the numbers backwards and that's 502 yards his poke picks up they first down on the gain of 18 what's remaining Fetty inside now this guy is still learning a lot he sort of started out he was going to be the tackle and any move them inside the guards are like what they did with Justin Britt but this Jermaine he fed he is a powerful Walker he is a guy if he can do figure out are they coming from the right or to the left sometimes that guard position can be confusing with all his loops stunts and he doesn't have much experience one at emporia I was thinking about you know Keithley if your Keatley and the team is four and eight which they will be and you had a concussion last year and that costs them three games and I have that thing I don't know what do you do it wouldn't even be close in my mind now I understand that you've got an obligation and he's gonna want to play I you know so many times now after having a couple of boys that played football as a parent I look at things much differently maybe than I did as a player or a coach or even a broadcaster look at the whole big but this is a superstar player with another good eight to ten years in front of him with his career and what do you gain this year you know you let him go he'll completely and I'm sure they will anyway and the doctors will check him out but just don't know if it's worth than you know decision to come down the lines we say though he's he has not been clear protocol I will say that Thomas Davis will be asked about it is what was depressed with what the league was doing from the concussion standpoint and thought that all the protocols for actually making a difference the sideline is Jermaine Kearse oh my goodness curse I think got away their pressure was put on a Westcourt birthing ball roughing the passer defense in the 96 15yard penalty and that was Horton he'll put the heat on and Boyd was able to hang in there and still get it down the sideline for 31 yards let's take a look sometimes these guys are so good at these little subtle push off see if he got one here just enough you know and it doesn't look like much but it sort of propels you forward and the other guy back just the notch and then you can make the play nice throw though up there by four five Boykin who really tore it up at TCU he threw for over ten thousand yards there an 86 touchdown passes and going right in and getting it done here didn't get drafted who's a free agent and they have found some gems of course been a Wilson picked in the third rounds started sis first and goal they keep pulling out of farmer and I'll make it second and go over under five minutes now to play Doug Baldwin went undrafted you know you're talking about some of the best players on this team Richard Sherman up in the is that the fifth round that Richard Sherman went in and yep so I mean there's all kinds of guys that needed that goes back to Pete Carroll and what he talks about he doesn't care whether you're drafted he doesn't care what your pedigree is he goes out to practice every day and whoever's defeating the hardest and winning the battles they play stuff from the backfield is poke you know you think about there's a 53 man roster 25 guys on the Seahawks were undrafted latif that's half the roster they have only two first rounders well and about ten of them are making all the money right and the rest of them are all these hyper competitive kind of guys that are out there and just fighting for their job and then they have the superstar group that is out there supposed to win the football games know where George pant they're starting the left tackle I still can't get over his story to get three left tackle in this league Boyka now Pass is incomplete you know you look at Boykins six feet short for a quarterback Wilson is 510 and in 5a so what they did is they went out and they got a backup quarterback that could sort of run the same sort of offense that Wilson runs yeah you know he ran a four seven three and there were some people that thought that Boykin might end up playing wide receiver in this league but you're right he comes in here and can have some of the same sort of skill sets that they get from Russell Wilson now obviously not to that level but you never know know how it's good and it's good well this one was already over before that fortytwo 7cm general manager John Schneider executive vp in the GM and we talked about him and he and Pete Carroll make some combination teams been to two of the last three Super Bowls last year got to the playoffs won a game against Minnesota before they got defeated by Carolina right now in a position to be the number two seed in the NFC and that's huge of course because you forgot another playoff thing those you're one or two you don't play a wild card game you go right into the next round and you have a home game that'll be the one to eat and get the conference championship deep in your ballpark so we get there the yard into the end zone sin to his old man and gets taken down up at the 30yard line 3 20 remaining Seahawks on their way to win three well for Cam Newton the last two games he's been under 50% and tonight he's probably not going to get there either stays in the game at 41.9% so be the first time he's been below 50 in three straight games and the night started with him not playing on the first play because of a discipline every situation so Derrick gainer sin had one pass tonight and he said he's really thrilled that he got to throw that one was a good pass deflected on intercepted yeah one rowdy get his euro coins Europe mass rating you got it it's front needle and this is Stewart taking up three so let's take a look right now at the playoff scenario update it we're gonna get moving to give Seattle the win for the moment so Dallas on top they pledged the playoff spot they go on a postseason Seattle right there Detroit a half gain back of Seattle and then Atlanta leads the south if the season ended tonight the Giants and Tampa Bay who would be your wildcard teams how about Detroit ever since Jim Bob cooter took over as that play caller this team the Matthew Stafford ways to win every week sometimes of the most him who gets the carry mike koval was the guy who was gonna be the recipient of the first pass of the game and couldn't handle it leading to the pick and it will be third down third and five with the relatively good chance is going to take us to the twominute warning damn doesn't look too anxious for a quick one here so nope yes you're right see it's good day trading right there twominute warning 42 7 Seahawks Oh and that's what you're gonna see next Sunday night Cowboys Giants Michelle on the field on the Volkswagen postgame report stars at the game Mike Tirico Tony Dungy Mike Florio weigh in and we will preview that Raiders Chiefs game coming up Thursday night on NBC and Sunday night game so we'll back up George Hill Malibu Kelly Hayes ad Freeland Melissa Horton old gang pack him up and hit the Kansas City we're supposed to be very toasty on the third look at the forecast the high of 22 third and five person makes the catch Carrie Underwood on Sunday night and the pentatonix on Thursday night of all their swords maybe game on Tuesday we should do the NBA my bobbing Wagner do you know what my good buddy Doc Rivers who I worked with years ago huge football fan keeps calling me what am I gonna do with my bears I said doc I don't know you notes there one today though I don't play the Niners everywhere cool right dock with that big a hook in his they slip that big hook the cards that sucker out over the sewage a drivethrough Fair was over second and ten fortytwo two days well Pete Carroll he loves the second half of the season get into December you look at that since 2011 that counts the night Freddie I take does 19 at 4:00 marijuana and we'll go to 18:5 Patriots of course what else is new travail in bedroom while those teams drew almost always in the playoffs my job Pete Carroll's done here though this fantastic it's like he gets younger every they're right and that will wrap it up little collegiality to end this one in Seattle another victory and the Volkswagen postgame report comes up on the other side of the bridge
