============================================================

and look at that at Safeco Field next door anniversary to us and in the Mariner organization in the folks responsible we thank you that's a great sight that's pretty cool isn't it very and right next door we come now to Westfield you never know the team is coming off its worst performance of the year they lost the Buffalo last week 38 9 the proudest Stoke the Seahawks kickoff Josh Brown pushing in the air and Terrence copper will take it back from the 10 yard he's made a mark on special teams ball came out for the moment but he recovers it himself at the 22 yard line let's take a look at the damaged offense Vinny Testaverde University of man Julius Jones state Jason Wade Tennessee Michigan State Larry Allen L Johnson so the Cowboys and Vinny Testaverde who did not start on Thanksgiving Day hurt his back in the game against Baltimore to attention got the starch played a half and and then he came on in the second half to guide them to the win and the right off the bat over genius Jones who breaks the first tackle and then picks up two to the 24 yard line here is the Seattle starting defense she goalkeeper Perdue said reporter Texas long Marcus tough tick grant Wistrom University of Nebraska I say it has of SP the Harvard University Orlando ha Fresno State Solomon Bates Arizona State Marcus Trufant Washington State Riviera University of Georgia can't hammer Fraser hospital Oh miss that defense missing its top four linebackers second down and eight and Julius Jones running the linebackers will be important for Seattle tonight with all of the injuries top door fight Chad brown as they try to work defensively of course against this guy and no question Johnny's going to see a heavy dose with those 63 carries in his first two games and I think you may not come until the third or fourth quarter when he has success because one thing I know rain Rhodes is going to do the defensive coordinator of the Seattle Seahawks he's going to put eight guys up there and make very difficult for Julius Jones for rum that ate up on that second play and a one blitz on first down that third and five and on this passing down they swing the ball juggled and then so Jones had it and then dropped it Solomon Bates the linebacker with a coverage in Dallas is three and hours another thing the other thing you know about this saddle defense are going to be heavy blitz of then he Testaverde on his first pass is trying to get there get back get it out of there quickly to Julius Jones and he just couldn't find the handle on that one Matt McBride his first year grew up in Australia actually was in the Sea Hawks training camp for a while last summer Blake's one down this is Maurice Morris and Morris is able to break free things down the sideline good return into Dallas territory tackle at the 44 yard line after a 25yard run back and here is the Seattle office Jerry Sean Alexander the University of Alabama back strong Jordan Jerry Rice miss Davis balanced 8pj water game due to Amelie but yeah elementary Walter Jones fraud State Steve Hutchinson commissioners Rob Tobin wazoo Chris gray Auburn University Chris Terry Georgia I knew sooner or later we'd get down to grade school I knew it had to happen while EA elementary that's the next step next step is pre skiing this is the guy who calls himself now Jackson who gains nine yards to the 37 let's take a look at the cowboy defense videos Neil Carlson Marvin Roy Glover sends a hose to fill of housing with Temple University can't win as a.m. text to Coakley Appalachian State State when Scott Northwestern Oklahoma State Road Way I'm gonna measure out what I'm playing spray West Virginia University Lance Fraser figures to have his hands full tonight over corner and on second and one they give the ball to the fullback max strong foot blocker carries once in a while Mike home goose team has a first down Mike now in his sixth season as the head coach at Seattle boy that time really flies when you think of it in those terms it's not that long ago that Mike's patrolling the sidelines and of course Bill Parcells after retiring came back in his second year now with Dallas ten and six last year and this year trying to hang on and they still hanging on because somebody had winds up eight made figures can make the playoffs in the the short of the first down pulled in by Bobby Engram now it's interesting the Seattle Seahawks on me and the last two first and have come out on in three wide receivers and I'm second down they would go to a normal tight end and run the ball back they're doing the same thing on this series and this is a Mike Hoggard taken thing you know here's the ears receiver here's a receiver here's a receiver and you have this thing you can kind of spread them out get that D French sped back and then throw the ball it's also not a bad running formation three wide receivers in this note on second achieved the ground Russians coming into this weekend alexander tackled by Carsten where Sean Alexander he's a guy who's done very well over the past four years but because Seattle has only been to the playoffs once because a lot of the lead considers this a geographical outpost you don't know that much about him but there his numbers right now he's fourth currently even remember most of the other guys who played one more game on him that game being yesterday a lot of his players aren't having their best year but one is having a better year than even Mike Holmgren expected as Shaun Alexander third down and one in a throat Hasselbeck has some time has to roll out and then flows into the end zone with a flag for the moment it's a touchdown but Dallas is going to contend that Jerry Rice pushed off so in a moment you've got a rice in for when he thinks he's six but let's see about the call there was clearly contact Nathan Jones is the defensive back he is a rookie out of Rutgers against the 20year old timer against the rookie Jerry Rice on Monday night he was open early one you see him right here he's the inside receiver very good coming off he say he was right open all the way Hasselbeck had to scramble out to his right and that gave Jerry Rice a little time to see that he was scrambling and then worked back to the inside yet Jerry Rice on his flow down a little bit he stood late getting away from the press Josh Brown point after 207 touchdowns now in his career 196 through the air it's Monday night it's Jerry Rice what else is new seven nothing under night football brought to you by Bud Light fresh smooth real it's all here nice on everything we touch we shift and everything we shift we try to make better and the new tmobile Sidekick to with IM email web browsing and more everybody needs a sidekick tmobile Space Needle symbol of Seattle soaring into the night sky 45 degrees and dry after a very rainy weekend put up some moisture before this one is done 7 to nothing Hawks on top Rashard Lee will run it back and they get taken down at the 24 yard line by Curtis Randle we referred to him as mr. Monday night in the opening tees tonight take a look at some of the things he has done on this series through the years 45 games it's almost three full seasons worth of games almost 4,000 yards 36 touchdowns on Monday night alone you know when you pointed him in his place you say what is it it's the best wide receiver that's ever played the game and I don't know who's second would be way behind whoever it is Gerry started the season as most of you know with Oakland and in the to become an effective number three guy and now he starts and this is Jones and Jones showing what he can do inside the 40 and finally chase down behind through the block and finally Kim Hamlin is able to run him down so rice does his thing and here comes the rookie to do his 53 yards close al Adams the left tackle makes them a nice block he's going to block down and then watch Larry Allen pull out here big 73 right there when he gets that block he just knocks Cavs defense key to the outside Julius Jones just wait runs right off a Larry Alan's block and then takes it up the field when you have a left side like that that's where you want to now at the Seattle 23 Testaverde the play fake to buy time good protection going for the end zone and Keyshawn Johnson team come down with it good coverage by Marcus Trufant and so instead of Washington state had positioned the ball hung a little bit and it's second down in ten Keisha is gonna run a corner here you see him you started up and then back to the corner Trufant is playing off him he's playing in his own so he comes into Trufant zone he just goes back and back and he out jumps him like that that ball maybe was thrown a little deeper Keyshawn mink may have had a better chance at but that ball was thrown to the back tie line it could have been a touchdown second down and 10 Jones 121 gets taken down by another can Lucas Jones and Michelle talked about it with a broken scapula then he comes back he has 30 carries against the Ravens and then four days later 33 against the Bears only Emmitt Smith would be in that category he did it on corresponding weeks during the 91 season Mike Anderson will Damien columns from the others who share in that Marv but this is a guy who earlier in that week against the Ravens was listed as out then he became doubtful then he carries 30 times he'll probably do it tonight though third down and eight then he over the middle of this crossover little the 18 yard line is a crisis throw it into Julius Jones so Jones is run puts them in position to get into the end zone or at least to the red zone and now they're forced to try an intermediate depth field goal you know and that's where they miss ritchi Anderson they you know Julius Jones would've been in there on that third down passing down that ball would have been thrown to Ritchie Anderson and so far Julius Jones has two drops ourselves barking a Jones as he came off till they conduct now this will be a 39yard attempt to Henson and kundus kick is just good just inside the left upright so Dallas is able to answer with three 849 remaining in the period and the Seahawks are on top seven to three on Monday Night Football aerial coverage tonight being provided by Budweiser Rushfield Seattle Washington more than 65,000 looking on early out here early dinner now boys to kickoff Morris and they push foreigners to the side and he goes out of bounds at about the 21 yard line Matt Hasselbeck coming in his brother Tim number three quarterback where Joe Gibbs at Washington he had a good year last year went to the Pro Bowl in fact father played tight in for the Patriots years ago knows Bill Parcells from way back with one of the ball boys when Bill was in New England went to Boston College remember Hasselbeck started at Green Bay when holmgren was there he was the backup to Favre and then came to Seattle to get reunited with Mike and right now the question is how healthy is he how effective can he be so far so good tonight and that's incomplete and John he suffered a severe what they call charley horse die bruised ribs as well on the cost of a start against Miami recently right then it was on his right knee and his right ribs and his whole right side but he says that he feels pretty good tonight watch Greg Alice here he's going to make a good move on this looks like he's going to go to the outside you start up to the outside lump clubbed him right to the inside and then go right around him and when he put a move on Fishburne he plugged in about left arm and just not good about three yards I was having a four volt I'm season as Alexander doesn't find much moon off the left side setting up third down and long getting back to Hasselbeck I think that you know they've lost a little confidence to him and he had a great year last year like you said he was in the pro ball and then that whole Ram thing you know when they lost to the Rams and rams came back and you know beat him there at the end of the game I think the whole team lost a little confidence then his receiver started dropping balls on though he finds say the right things that do the right things big spot Carrie rice reaching up makes the catch Jerry Rice at the Asia there's no covered well down the sideline pants a little bit in front of them is able to fingertip it and Beach Lance Frazier and Roy Williams on the play Jerry Rice out here you're going to see that hole right there in the cover between the short corner and the safety and he hit him perfectly in that hole I was watching practice the other day and they were throwing this pass laughing once you get by the corner before you get to the safety you have about a five Alexander pushed back right off the bat by Leonardo Carson so there is Jerry Rice already full of chalk and sweat but he has a touchdown he has two catches and 44 yards receiving tonight you know it's you know there's a lot of things great about Jerry Rice and you can you know say all the accolades but the thing that always impressed me about him is his work ethic you know you say that you know he made this great catch he's caught this many balls and then the oneness many games but you know what he probably works harder than any wide receivers ever worked in history second down and 11 as they empty the backfield here build enough practice to be a free play for Seattle back to death away from the sack and in the FreePlay turns out to be an interception that won't mean a thing in the way nosey Greg Ellis put the pressure that time on the quarterback but it was a free play Greg Ellis should have been the guy to put the pressure on because he was the guy that jumped offsides and Matt Hasselbeck were smart here if you have a free play like this then go deep I mean just don't throw some dumpoff thing and you see Greg Ellis got caught in a neutral zone Hasselbeck knew as you said he had a free one and if I have a free one let's go for a big one Roy Williams intercepts and like you say even knew he knew that one wasn't gonna count right off the bat 61 passing yards for Siena 60 rushing woods and nothing in the air there's fall for those San Diego State playing very well iron mantle one that defensive front gets in there for the sack yeah we saw Greg Ellis do it to Kris Terry and here you're going to see little Roy Glover but do it to Chris gray he's right here you see here he is right here here's Chris gray and what they're doing is they're just getting off on the ball and clubbing him you see start start with one move right into him and then just take one arm and just pull them off with that arm 90 second straight story for the Ironman most there any defensively inferred that inquired now Jim Crow first that into Dallas territory the Coulomb melee the tightass and subsequently BYU Fame 18 yards first out you know and that's the type of thing that's what you always look for in a zone you're going to see Neely just come here get by the linebackers and in front of the secondary and it was his own defense and that's an area that the quarterback will usually look to when he reads zone defense nealy still the starter they drafted Jeremy Stephens a year ago number one but Neely is fending him off and fended him off relief to this boy two minutes gone Alexander unable to get on track those far is their basic running back their big back is now carry the ball a total of four times for only three yards well that's one of the the things that the Cowboys are taken away and remember Bill Parcells said last night he said I expect him to tend to spread us out and then try and run it that's what they did on that last play they had four wide receivers tried to spread the cowboy defense out and run in the middle the cowboy defense just didn't spread out second down and eight here's a draw down and this time he's given a little bit of running is Greg Elvis makes the tackle but this will come up a little bit short of the first down yeah we're talking about it running back after be patient all the time watch Sean Alexander here this is going to be a run blitz you're going to see the Blitz here now he asked the left stuff developed because he has a little trap there so he waited for that trap to go made a little move to the right that a little move to the left and just the patient picked up about five yards that's tough when you want to play right into a run blitz and make five yards that's pretty good running third an eighteeninch the full amount of fun here and a fourman run and a Ford Escort by Darrell Jackson and Jackson is inside the 10 and quest so Darryl Jackson turns a short gain into a he started over on the left side and he comes across the formation you're going to see him here he starts on the left side comes all the way across runs a shower cross catching the ball there makes a real good move there gets to the outside and turns on the afterburner yeah that's that's that's a big play in this West Coast offenses at shallow broth we see Jacksonville fire over the years pounding better than Jerry Rice 35yard play fake clothes Jackson touchdown the Seahawks converting third downs along the way they've converted four in the game to this point and on top 13 three Wade look like Darryl Jackson right here he just turns Terrence moving around Newman sees him to the inside then he thinks he's going outside and Newman falls down and quite as Hasselbeck drill that thing in there the minute that he sees that move I'm Terrence Newman he kids catching the ball Josh Brown for the extra point Hasselbeck has started the game seven of a 416 yards hot start for the Seahawks 14 3 Seattle we'll be in Nashville a week from tonight Kansas City coming off its win yesterday over Oakland taking on Tennessee question about Steve McNair don't know if he'll play or not but Steve McNair and the Tennessee Titans at home against Kansas City Brown to kickoff for the Seahawks it's taken Rashard leader from the five up to the 31yard line 26 yard return and that's where the Dallas Cowboys will take over late in the first quarter as they trail Seattle by Monday night now us in the 31 yard line trailing 14 to 3 with Testaverde at the hell tie then jason witten has been a big part of their offense and one of Benny's favorite receivers Testaverde remember came to Dallas from the Jets and he was going to be the backup to Quincy Carter but then Carter been failing a drug test Bill Parcells couldn't trust him release Carter that was the big story in training camp and all of a sudden here came Vinnie at that point 40 years old 'inna as the starter clearly not the longterm answer they wiped the drew Hinson will be the longterm answer as Jones so Henson finally gets the start because Testaverde got banged up banged up and there is drew to form a Yankee farmhand who was out of football for three and a half years so Henson gets the start on Thanksgiving Day doesn't perform very well against Chicago and Parcells has to win the game he's at the best chance to win the game he puts Vinnie back in but sooner or later John they're going to have to find out about yeah and you I think that begs the question when do you have to find out I'm not sure that he is the quarterback of the future I don't think anybody with the Dallas organization is quite sure yet and this is Jones fighting for a first down tackle and the question is did he get it he'd go through the bed is the middle linebacker is the first guy there it was third down and one and they didn't get it you know one thing about red Rhodes he's going to overload that great defensive side because he expects when they're going to run this is where they're going to come because of Larry Allen flows down at him so he's going to have something special he's going to have everyone running at getting to that Hall because he knows that when they need a yard or two they're going to run to their left they ran to the left that's the fifth straight time Dallas has failed on a third and one remember earlier the season it was Eddie George who a successful alive that's a problem for them now is Matt McBride 27 by Maurice Morris who falls forward to the 29 so that Seattle D does its job the yo comes back out of there up 14 to 3 in the Pacific Northwest Steve Largent number 80 has been retired the Great Sea Hawk receiver went to the Hall of Fame became a congressman subsequent to retirement honored here in their Ring of Honor and Jerry Rice called him and asked if he could borrow number 80 enlarging so I'd be honored and that's called growing rice this is old 80 balance of his Seahawk career Alexander stopped in his tracks here you know we talked about Larry Allen being a great offensive lineman and the Seattle Seahawks have won on their own Walter Jones a left tackle watch him I mean he's that guy that holds out all the time and never comes a training camp and then just comes and just takes his guy and stays with him and drives them and drives him drives them about seven yards down the field this guy have something very special maybe the best tackle in football Jonathan Ogden would be in a very elite group second down along with the Ravens as and puts it outside and Shawn is tackled up at the 36 yard line let's go to Michelle talking about Jerry Rice I spoke with Seahawks wide receivers coach Nolan Cromwell and he said ever since rice got here he can see all the other jumbo receivers watching everything he does and he said the biggest thing rice demonstrates is patience patience running his routes patience office releases patience catching the ball and even the way he works guys when he runs his routes so krama hopes that his young receivers know if they're patient and they work their routes they can excel Jerry Rice the ultimate role model Seattle on third down and three and therefore for four on third down conversions and that will be four out of five thanks to Laroy brother with a big second that'll force a punt and play resumes in the second quarter we played one in Seattle with the score Seattle 14 Dallas 3 and Monday Night Football resumes after this message and a word for ABC stations been booked with Mike Holmgren six and five Hasselbeck shaken up on that sack by Glover that's blowers first to sack Dean since he was a saint can Walter to kick for Seattle is the second quarter begins lanced raging the run attack up to the 41 yard line elected and his incomplete into his tip and then almost intercepted Rashad Moore with the tip and then almost picked off by Isaiah Kaz eventually the linebacker and he couldn't hold it either I think the umpire was in the middle of that too easy he's the guy that lines up right behind the linebackers he's right in this thing so you have a tip right there then the umpires trying to get out of the way Kaz offense keep dying for it almost comes up with it and then think it's a live ball of course it's not second down and ten now early second period she walks up by 11 points play fake five times being set up with the tight end and Witten at a Tennessee takes it to the 39 he's a couple of yards shy of the first down tackle there by Rashad Moore will be third down and two you know they are really they are really playing Julius Jones and I think that that's one of the advantages that Bill Parcells wants to take here is is if they're going to play him use his at him as a decoy they brought him off to the right side and then they got across behind the linebackers that were pursuant to this side and to at the 39yard line crowd exhort sits defense this better be a passing down for the Cowboys and take a timeout timeout Dallas third and two when we come back after the timeout its third down and two for the Dallas Cowboys just inside the Seattle 40yard line here and they do as they give the ball Julius Jones the rookie out of Notre Dame second round draft choice this spring they did not have a number one they traded their number one they traded down so they wind up with Buffalo's number one next year Julius Jones did a couple things you have to do in short yardage get there quickly and get there low and watch what Larry Allen does here he's going to get a push and when you get that kind of course in the middle that's the place that you cut back to first time Dallas in 236 getting on a roll keeps on rolling steps out of bounds to Keyshawn Johnson who was out of bounds second down and ten that's one of the things that Cowboys want to do with Benny you know that you know that he can't run and you know that he's not going to scramble and move a lot therefore you make some of those organized bootlegs some of those roles some of those Sprint's just so the defense can't point rush on them just in other words just everyone rushes to a single point knowing that he'll be there Cowboys in the first quarter this year have been fine at plus six but the rest of the way diminishing returns as the game goes along they have a tough time playing uphill and they'll have to do that tonight that camp is made by the former Brown Quincy Morgan came over to midseason deal Ken Lucas with the coverage you know the problem before they got Julius Jones as they didn't have a running game and all their playmakers were were receivers either wide receivers or Jason Witten their tight end so in order to get the ball to them they had to throw it so in order to prevent that but Vinny Testaverde everything went on his shoulder Julius Jones are now having a runner they can take a little of that pressure off of Bennett their adult a pretty good blow earlier this season when Terry Glenn would've been their key receiver or one of them got hurt his gone for the year for them for that was incomplete of course Keyshawn Johnson we seem to make that move but copper that copper making a Keyshawn Johnson his Marcus Trufant covers on the play so 18 instead of 19 of them it looked just like Keyshawn the way he got up to Lisa where's that flag well they just ran that slant pattern but you see they come inside a Larry Allen he gets a little pressure on there but Vinny Testaverde had time to throw that ball that's a pretty good move by Mike awkward getting inside and what he thought he thought he was held by his right arm when he went up to catch that ball 49 yard at 10 now for Billy Cundiff who was dressed good from 39 earlier this one is hooking hits the upright and goes over a mini doink every every once in a while you need one of those not the full think just the mini the ping 146 the point so they kind of just bangs a field goal off the upright to make it a one possession game Seattle up by eight points early second period 40degree nine about 45 at game time here in Seattle dry Seahawks to get the ball released Morris is back there who accepted at the 5yard line to the 21 Sean Alexander of these she watches miked up tonight Monday night go baby let's go that was bad right there but just being with mr. Monday night worried about the jump in their water with hey China holding tight on your boy right now that exam talking about that rice touchdown and they know where to go if you're going to jump in some water that's not bad water to jump in that rice water first contender Atok swinging his age that fought with hula and melee gain of 11 Shaun Alexander running back tonight they billed him in check but left throughout his career different story tonight six carries for eight yards but he has three straight years with 15 or more touchdowns Jerry Rice on that list as well with Terrell Davis and Emmitt Smith and this season Alexander has 13 kind of goes on the ground to the outside close to a first down tena koe bye dad win you know John just going back to that a race touchdown pass for a second you had the interference on Jones you know you wonder you could have called it on Jerry too at the end of the play offensive and you can do that you know when you're in the league as long as she is it's like it's like a guy who hits 300 every year you're going to get the benefit of the strike zone how many strikes if they ever call on Ted Williams right like was this everything of a letter throw it must be a ball the piri Reis blood and someone had their huh our Mac that must be the other guy here's Alexander again it's a nice play onehanded tackle by that win and just to go back and rejoin the slate Jerry Rice with the touchdown catch here clearly there's interference early and then watched Jerry maneuver to try to get positioned back and he does I mean he he had Nathan Jones beat all the way there and Jones runs in to him and grabs him he pushed the little seat Jerry's left arm right there push that's that's one way to get separation second he said it rice going to fill a lot with corn Robinson suspended after that step some good presents those finds the open man and the ball is dropped and the Dallas Cowboys come away with the ball it's Linscott coming back and Scott is out of bounds at the 39 of Seattle so Terrence Neuman with the coverage on Jeremy urban urban making the catch had it taken away had it stripped that and Scott runs it back into Seattle Territory Jeremy ermine is the outside receiver and you're gonna see him here he catches the ball and then he turns to run and the ball is stripped right there and the Cowboys come up with it that's that's one thing that you have to do now in tackling is is you always go for the tackle but you also go for the strip do you see Terrence Newman there that right hand comes in there with a chop to try the script cowboy is not a lot of takeaways this year that's only 12 and it's their 12th inning Julius Jones stopped there by has events P the linebacker I'll tell you one thing about Julius Jones he hits all holes quickly and there's not much there's not much time where it is blocking to develop on if you're going to get a block close out Adams and Larry Allen on that side you better get it quickly because he is going to be into and through there he's a coal miner son but the difference is his mother is the coal miner Julius Jones's mother is a West Virginia or at least was a West Virginia coal miner second down and six at the 45 at the 35 yard line and this was Jones and he fights his way for a first man and Michelle you know all about that I do because I talk to him about it Betty his mom was a coal miner for 19 years now she worked for the West Mullan Coal Company in Appalachia Virginia and they were all very nervous about it all seven of her kids because she was really deep underground so when Julius his older brother Thomas got drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in 2000 she was finally able to retire and even though he's proud to be a coal miners son he's glad she's aboveground Jerry Jones knowing she's a terrific lady she said it's the last thing in the world heretofore she ever did Testaverde comes from underneath and it's off the back of alignment and then a flag is thrown because he threw it off Larry Allen's back duster birdies having trouble in that middle I mean a couple of times they hit Julius Jones and he dropped the ball and he's hit defensive lineman hit his own offensive lineman came very close to hitting the umpire that's a congested area they're trying to get into there Terry McCauley will make the call but a fairly penalty free game only one accepted penalty list illegals touching the past offense number 73 first down Hasselbeck has missed only once tonight he has two touchdown passes and that rating is help perfecto one 58.3 vinny slow start Ben he didn't throw for that much Heatley thanksgiving David just efficiently guided the team on two touchdown marches and that was enough to beat Chicago 21 his shoulder and he came in last night said it wasn't my shoulder was my back my back was out of alignment he said but he feels fine tonight give it to Jones on the 1st and 15 130 yards grant Wistrom the longtime RAM who came over here in the offseason makes the tackle and they really like grant Wistrom because he's one of those guys they always say the same thing about him he has a motor that goes a hundred and ten miles an hour and and he does I mean he goes to the time the ball snapped until the whistle blows he goes full speed and then like railroads the defensive coordinator was telling me the other day that you hope that the other guys around of just feed off this guy second and 14 over the middle underneath route caught there by Darian Barnes flag down flags on the far side of the field indicated against Seattle then he finally found his guy there in the middle who use of hands for the face defense that's the big part and with this big part it's an automatic first down that's Ken Lucas he's the right corner and a very good player you see him right here he's just going to come up and again that's what happens when you go to get that Jam you want to jam that receiver on the line of scrimmage but if your hand goes up and hits him in the face mask or anywhere in the helmet then it's an illegal blow to the face that's a tough one and the railroad wants his corners up there he wants him to jamming every once in a while you're gonna have to take the fuel though first in 10:26 Jones mr. rocky Bernard the valve ad law right watch Isaiah Kaz events given is he's a guy if he if the defensive line does their job up in front then that allows a linebacker to run free here and make that play and you can hit that fullback in the backfield like that there's no place for the tailback to run second and ninth at the 26 press the Verdie throws that's quite good hands wit first down inside the ten first down and goal upcoming well he's a good player that jason witten yeah railroads were saying the other day that he thinks he's the best tight end in the NFC and you see that you know he's turned into a pretty good blocker but as Vinny Testaverde said he's a great receiver and the thing that makes him a great tight end receiver is he always gets leverage on the defender and you just saw up there how he gets to the inside shoulder and then breaks out away from the inside shoulder walking him down the defenses have in the last two games but pata game tonight he's brought three to thirty yards first down and goal with protection testaroli pump fakes draws and that is in the back of the endzone by Terrence copper flag though flag that's a 2yard line I think that pump that you said I think it was to copper the first time copper was open and then Vinny pumped it to him got it back and Campuzano so again holding defend tam and Hamlin Terrence Kapur he's holding Keyshawn Johnson see Keyshawn is right here number 19 drop us on the inside 18 that's where they called the whole thing here's the touchdown maybe that first pump was to Keyshawn Johnson put a bid Dallas is going to go for two a lot of people say away it's too early in the game convert ourselves has elected at least they didn't elect and then they decided to call a timeout so we'll see what they do when we come back 1412 at the moment Cowboys will go for a deuce and Vinny Testaverde has just established an NFL record breaking a tie with Steve de Berg he's mapped on a touchdown pass at his 18year career 263 different receivers copper being the 63rd and now Vinny's got a flank out and a little trick play coming up here as Patrick Regan takes the staff and communicate Cowboys try a trick twopointer flying Testaverde out snapped the ball back to the rookie from Northwestern Oklahoma State Patrick Crayton juggles it can't get in still a twopoint game trickery and deceit get the Cowboys nowhere the twopoint conversion Morris runs back to the 18 to a point play let's take a look again at that trickery and conceit here's Benny Testaverde we see the quarterback and he's going to go out and he's going to spread out to the left Patrick Crayton will then be this guy right here the only guy he gives a silent count there the ball is snapped a little behind them he's trying to run a power sweep into the end zone and it doesn't work nope built for ourselves you always have to watch out for that not that he always has like three or four trick plays in every game go back I've been fine whoa baby thank you the cash and getting ripped by Roy Williams is Darrell Jackson that's a 12yard Jackson is a guy well known in these parts who drops a lot of on target passes this money holds on to him I was able to keep holding on to it without hit you know that habit they had eight men in the box when we talked about how they're going to stop this Seattle run Roy Williams was a strong saftey he was up in the box they only had three feet but when he reached pass he comes flying back there next play is a fouryard gain by Sean Alexander on the ground over the left side five and a half to go I think that's why I hustle Beck is doing so well because he the Cowboys are saying that we're gonna stop Sean Alexander and we are not going to let them run on us we're going to gang up we're going to have eight now we're going to have Roy Williams up there and if they're going to beat us Hasselbeck is going to have to do it and the things that have been open have done in the passing game I saw that there's now 11 Jaxson makes that catch tackle by Newman and they beat the Blitz on a 17yard pickup dude they did on that side like you said ala was the Blitz but you see the formation is all over here in the right side so then they get singled back here and this is where he comes with a ball to get the coverage over there bring the Blitz now you have a true oneonone and a whole back side isolation Seahawk 48 the Dallas 48 for a first time out Alexander and stop by that win game of two second and eight Valerie Alexander looking on now her husband's going to be if he does not sign a contract before the free agency period a free agent both Hasselbeck and Alexander are in what they call their contract years and Walter Jones is too and you know and this is an offensive team and this is a a gift that has to keep those guys and they have three big timers I have to keep second and a half of that juggled it was almost intercepted it's incomplete that had hit nine consecutive passes you think you know the guys drop passes and Matt Hasselbeck has had a lot of passes dropped on him and they're just like he says there's nothing you can say to the guy that dropped the pass because and I felt this I mean years back in coach and the guy that feels the worst about a drop pass was always a guy who dropped it the second guy is probably of white and then he'd get down to the quarterback this woman and maybe some more wine in the center third cousin third mate a Sebastian or one of himself and his forward progress is they're going to be short of the first down when you go headfirst like that the plays not over until forward progress stops if you slide it's where you begin that slide and they're short of the first down so now what do you do this is one of the things they the Cowboys were in the nickel defense so they did give him that thing and Bill Parcells was aware of that he says you know Bill Parcells I said you know this guy will run you now and Parcells was talking about Matt Hasselbeck but now what do you do well every crowd well for starters you take a timeout that's that's what I like Mike hold now what do you do let me have a timeout and think about it 3:35 left of the opening half Dallas Ford seven Seattle six and five Fjell trying to stay on top in the NFC West I don't know that he did call timeout yogi the coach can call timeout from the sidelines who saw my clone and call a timeout and I don't think anyone accepted his time outdated so it looked like he changed his mind of course they can talk to the quarterback in the hot they don't have to come over to the sideline anyway he has decided to go for it well they're gonna let the clock run down and then call the timeout is what they're gonna do so on official time out here my cauldron called that time I took it back let the clock wound down and now what see what he's going to do he's gonna he's gonna go for it we talk about the left side to be the Dallas Cowboy offensive line this is a very good left side of this Seattle Seahawk like this isn't a bad place if you're going to run to go up and as a fumble and a man who recovers it the ball is gonna belong to Dallas Hasselbeck gets in himself so the best laid plans unless the clock for him down he calls the timeout play call who knows what it would have been right now it's Dallas ball you see what the Cowboys did they had six defensive linemen in there it looks like Hasselbeck may come out of there a little quick you see him look like he started out before the ball was coming up you want me to see the six defensive lineman everyone to get to lower they don't get much movement on that side anyway they got penetration on that left side where they were probably done what they wanted to made a first down anyway now Rob Etobicoke Centre snapping it now from the 41 here come the Cavaliers Jones to the 45 office and andre Jerrod Joaquina for the three minutes to go in the first half they talk to Julius Jones last night and you know ask him when he comes out to you know to take a breather ever takes himself out and he said not only do I never take myself out I don't even think of ever trying to take myself out he told us that Parcells got on him for coming out of a preseason game then after we broke his shoulder blade he stayed in for four more plays he was afraid to come out well I'm second exception the Clippers as late as a sissy third and short coming up you know and that's one of the problems with the Cowboys now now that they have a running back or think they have a running back in Julius Jones they need that other guy you know that other guy that will come in for a change of pace that will give him a break or at least that third down back like like like a Richie Anderson right now there's the other guy Eddie George they don't have confidence that he can do it or he they get it off before the twominute warning on third and one at that time they converge owns takes it to the 47 so a minute 57 to the half would take Seattle up by 2 at home I just plan to spend the entire interview taking instruction getting swing thoughts first and 10 from the 47 and Joe's breaking tackles stop finally by Trufant inside the 31st half Cowboys it flows how Adams is hurt 19 yard game now the Seattle Seahawks went in a dime defense er six defensive backs and came out of blitz on that play and they gassed him with the draw or the delay glozell Adams as you say I was still down there it was a draw or delay play and you watched Flozell here and then he's and he's picking up a blitz or a stunt looks like if anything happened to her before that it was just Larry Allen stepped on right there look at ya you see what happened is Larry Allen just kicked his right foot out from under the big diamond when you're as big as flow cell atoms and way about 345 pounds of the guy kicks you foot out from under you some stuff starts to bobble it's an automatic time out so Julius Jones the rookie already with a hundred eleven yards in this first half had 150 on Thanksgiving Day flows el Adams came out of the game Curt folders had come in and then now Adams because of the timeout is able to come back you have to have a timeout charged to you when you're hurt in the last two minutes of a half so that's why they are out of timeouts right now the Cowboys are yeah you see Julius Jones as 15 carries were already Bill Parcells said I don't want him to carry 30 times every game you may not carry 30 may carry forward first and ten couldn't give the blocking he needed tackle there by antonio cochran and line of scrimmage one thing as a ik as events key was up there and he's playing that that screen well I mean any any delay type of thing any screen anything that they get out to a back casa been ski has been there all the time and that's it the thing is they're gonna try and get this clean out here you see a screen and right and watch right there's calves identity because we want to get on that guy and make him declare so I can attend from the 28 yard line okay Darien warrants incomplete Marcus Trufant I think the thing that Vinny Testaverde is thinking right here is is is I'm right on the edge of fieldgoal I probably have a field goal and the one thing that we can't take is we can't take a loss we can't take a sack we don't want to do want to force anything and his third as long as the tub situation I mean you can either go for that short thing you know just to get your field goal kicker and by the way the heck with it you know let's try and go for that 12 yard pass third and 10 now first and goal he said to lift Rob guard fast and get up there and spiking still plenty of time is off the clock here that's okay he doesn't have to worry about hitting his own guy with it I think that's what he was thinking he didn't spike it that's why the clock the ball came loose now he spikes it so because he didn't spike it he actually fumbled the snap that's why the the plate that's why the clock kept running it was ruled a fumble I thought that he did spike it but thought that he did he hit his own guy which is okay to hit your own guy but like you say it was a fumble he never had control of it yeah look at that yeah you see he never got control of it so that he could spike it so he had to recover but at least he knew okay I didn't spike it I better get it because that's not a spike then I better get up and do it again I said a second down it's a critical third doesn't work Julius Jones makes a heck of a move on that they give him spread out Seattle's expectant pass because there was no timeout they were in dying defense and six defensive backs in there which is an ideal time to run a draw but they're for the extra point Yoma makes a good block on that is al Johnson the center and he's starting to pull a lot more what you see is you'll see Larry a little block down and then al Johnson the center will pull around so so Allen gets that block right there and right there Johnson gets his guy he gets Casa Vince key whose man is is Julius Jones you see Jones waiting right there for him and you see he just comes right off on him and here's Jason Witten this is it this is a play that set it up starts as an outside receiver we know he's a tight end but the thing is he's such a good receiver and runs such good patterns that they could just put him anywhere on the field five point Dallas lead in a game of which Seattle got off to a hot start led 14 to three but the Cowboys who have trouble playing uphill that was 16 unanswered points and a little more than a half minute to go in the half pretty good play call in there by the old coach because you know he wasn't sure exactly what happened on that on that fake and then on that spike and it went from first down to third down on him very quickly and third that meant if they did could work chances are they would have had a settle for the field goal and a 15:14 leaders that is 1914 kickoff comes out of the ten lowest Morris to the 28 clock stops at the end of this play 28 seconds remaining in the half timeout ourselves at home could have had a couple of times in the past including the Super Bowl in New Orleans Super Bowl 31 turned out to be Bills last as the Patriots coach and this was the goal today for Mike Holmgren this his years at Green Bay were paid off Desmond Howard was the most valuable player with his blunt backs that afternoon in New Orleans that fabled sight the confetti streaming down hand and being carried off and make the oil the Super Bowl of the Packers the reporter a passerby in the scene Jackson 43 first now their timeout taken by Seattle that's their second a lot of coaches have won the Super Bowl and tried to win it with other teams Vince Lombardi played a coach with the Redskins Dom McCafferty won it with the Colts that Detroit hired them he had Hank Stram with the Chiefs and if he went to the Saints in the mid70s Tom Flores won't the Super Bowl with the Raiders and then came up here Jimmy Johnson with the Cowboys then to the Dolphins for four seasons Mike Ditka after the Chicago Super Bowl triumphs went to New Orleans George Seifert in San Francisco then to Carolina Dick Vermeil still going one over the Rams now trying to do with the Chiefs eventually Mike hungry and Bill Parcells against the Leslie is here to win a Super Ball State after that closed at about oh it's happening this mystery agency offense number 72 10yard penalty first down Chris Terry you know free agency and salary cap you have a salary cap on what you can pay players to make up your team and there's no salary cap on coaches so I think that's some place if you're looking for an advantage in the salary cap area that's a place you can get an advantage is paying paying a coach a whole heck of a lot of money out of owners would try to do that but the bottom line John is that no coach has won a Super Bowl with that if you are a coach and you do have a good team and you win Super Bowl just stay there and be happy that's what I would be well you know Parcells came the closest because he took the women to the Super Bowl but didn't win it he took the Jets to the AFC Championship game as Gary Weis Lakes to cash but they throw underneath and they got a run out of time yeah but don't you feel that he should have stayed with the Giants well never he who is a health issue at that point he needed some time off I hate the fact they've blown an 11point lead it's 1914 Dallas resounding boos at Qwest Field coming up next will be the Lexus halftime show Tiger Woods coming up live when we come back to Seattle 1914 Dallas at the half the Space Needle simple of Seattle Washington Monday night with Dallas on top 1914 because they're ready to kick off for the Dallas Cowboys now that would be a bridge and that would be a bridge and a half Maurice Morris brings it back to the 21 yard line and let's check in with Michelle Mike Holmgren told me at halftime that in order to slow down Julius Jones you may need to commit one more defender to the box and as far as his own running game goes he is still committed to getting Sean Alexander going as for Bill Parcells he really likes the way his team is moving the football he told me he's concerned about his defense settling down not giving up as many big plays here in the second half his prediction whoever grabs momentum early they will probably win well he wants to start on the ground as you said he does with Alexander that gets a nice run here on the opening play gain of nine up to the 30 yard line Linscott is there for the tackle take a look at the numbers through the first half Jones already has 119 on the ground and thus Dallas dominating on the ground Seahawks more through the air Seahawks have turned the ball over one time ten yards for the place like we've always said be the Ryan gets easier in the third before a quarter now examine or it's a fender and it's batwing who comes away with a football so on Alexander and he won't even argue the point take a look at the replay the watch we talked about they have eight man in the box and you see Roy Williams you say he's the guy and he gets in there he makes the first spot and as he twists that's when the ball comes out of Alexander watch him see he makes the hit right there and then the ball starts to come out that win is right there to pick it up the second turnover for the Seahawks at about the same spot isn't it first one costly the other one the Jeremy Urban fumble which was run back into Seattle territory of his Oken and he scored at the end of the drama Thurston tonight from the 21 fake Joan customer to close out the introduction adoption has a first down he's at about him near the 10yard line we're down seeing like Mike Holmgren was taller Michelle that you know you may have to put that eighth guy up there to stop Julius Jones get that extra guy then then now you concentrate on Julius Jones you concentrate on stopping her run and what's quit and watch what they do they're going to fake him in here and bootleg out to this side see the fake there now everyone is going for Julius Jones Vinny Testaverde can just come out to the back side and Keyshawn Johnson is wide open that's where running helps for passing them first can go to the eyeball touchdown battery and barrage the fullback led the way so far sells watches his team get a big take away and very quickly boom into the end zone two tight ends they get in there this is where running helps a running game again anytime you're going to get a big block here and you're going to get a big block here and anytime you get this handle you have a chance for a pretty big run running in watch Larry Allen just stay with his guy turn his guy out and then Julius Jones can come for the point after so a 143 Seattle lead is now a 2614 Seattle deficit Dallas by a dozen across the parking lots at Safeco Field the beautiful retractable roof home of the Seattle Mariners roof is open tonight and our thanks to the acknowledgment of 35 years old more than a football Maurice Morris takes the kicker Daniel and brings it back up to the 27 yard line so the Seattle Seahawks who start with a turnover now down by 12 points go back to work after that Alexander turnover you know who's going to be quiet about right now those people who said they wanted to drew Henson yeah I think I think that has gotten out now all those things in the NFL are very temporary I mean you know it comes and goes you have a good team here a bad team know you're in you're out you're all these things but I think that drew Henson stuff was going to calm down a little well it was a big story in Dallas after the Thanksgiving game work owner Jerry Jones expressed in his words of disappointment and some frustration over the fact they won the game he loved that but they couldn't do it with the young guys obviously reading number one Henson master bath was passed so some of the quotes that he had in regard to that I thought we had seen enough negatives from Drew on that second guessing bill he loved the wind it'll be exciting for the fans when they can do with the young players so it was disappointing to see Henson bench and of course that led to all of the stuff about well we told you wouldn't work ourselves and Jones but you know what you have to be I've been disappointed in himself that Henson couldn't play well in the second half after the first bill would have loved to have won the game we drew him right and he was seeing that you know he was getting blitzed and there were things that he couldn't handle and you know he was a little late on everything and I think the big thing about drew Henson is he's going to get his opportunity and I think a lot of that stuff was just kind of hoping against hope kind of rooting for him that they haven't really had one since play eight men and this guy has to be the guy and they want him to be the guy so badly that maybe he's not the guy today's world when you parse every belch in the paper and on talk radio they wanting to make a big deal out of it third down and seven axleback throws and it's tip by Linscott 4th down and 7 who's checking with Michelle well I spoke to Jerry Jones about those comments you were talking about Allen he said since Thanksgiving he invoked ourselves have been in constant communication that together they agreed right now is the focus and that Vinny Testaverde gives them the best chance to win this game tonight they're living in the here and now and I think as long as Vinny Testaverde keeps performing the way he is out based on what Jerry Jones told me there's not going to be a quarterback change they come out of this with a win they're five and seven then they have the warning is at home next week right in there right in the middle of that big old plump he's a club allstar hear the snap false start offense number 53 Kelly the Cowboys are picked up the momentum but they know they have it that you can feel the fans turning against their Seahawks been on that on that last play in that third down play they came with a safety blitz it gave it a lot of pressure on the left side and it brought their safety Roy Williams and looks like they think that now they want to throw Hasselbeck out of any rhythm that he may have had earlier they wanted to stop Shaun Alexander now I feel that they want to come and put a lot of heat on Matt Hasselbeck cantle Walker recently picked up last year they're caught up at the 44yard line by Lance Frazier proudly as you can crowd boos the offense crowd not happy Dallas up by clothes the state of football is what its fall one of those helmets come from the Palouse region over in eastern Washington or Washington State I just love the State Police it's just such a great word to say yeah what I like to say is Bellevue Bellevue a pretty good Joe a Bellevue beat D less ow as you shine Johnson on the sideline stays inbounds with great concentration holes in a 39yard pants and run from Vinny Testaverde you're going to say here's Keyshawn Johnson here's per font right here he's up on him but he doesn't get a bump you see he gets a little touch there a little touch here which is really illegal and a perfect throw by Vinny Testaverde almost Keyshawn Johnson in her late academic but hold hold it because maybe there was a place the replay I think I think Mike Holmgren has to challenge that one yep too big a play in the game right it was on the other side of the field but again does Keyshawn have control of the ball right there and both feet inbounds I think he's going to win this challenge and that's something that Mike Holmgren has not done very often we asked to have control and keep control all the weight falling on the ground which he does but how about that throw by Vinny Testaverde I mean that's about as perfect as a pass can be be pretty close back in a moment we've been viewing this and we think that this will be ruled a catch and will not be overturned and Mike Holmgren will see another failed challenge take a look at Johnson one foot down drags the second has possession in the air there still has possession even though it's with one hand on the ground the receiver control the football pin down on his left foot and his right foot it has completed catch well we're at the challenge posted enough but again Mike Holmgren she's another challenge to go down the drain and I think he just had to do anything just slow up this cowboy offense but look at the time that Vinny Testaverde has that's a perfect pocket and he throws a perfect pass I mean Keyshawn Johnson didn't give him a lot of room to the sidelines so he didn't have any width so he had to do it with depth and throw it right over his head you see that pocket I mean that was a good shot from there where if it showed out Benny had the protection and how he could see and how he could step up and get everything on that throw johnson's biggest play of the year longest 39 yard with such a first down 17 yard line for the cowboy old man really was Joan but this looks like such a different cowboy team than we saw three weeks ago and we talked about it earlier about a team that you know has the confidence now and even Bill Parcells I felt had more confidence and to me it's it's all about being able to run the ball and Julius Jones and and now the Seattle Seahawks were after worried about stopping him and then they do that and everything else light up nickel four wide receivers spread them out now what do you do if your Seattle second down the line going Julius Jones Flagg playing at the 5yard line Dallas Quincy Morgan the receiver holding and costing on the touchdown you wonder why because you know they had them spread out Quincy Morgan is that side and you're going to see him right here he was a slot receiver he just eat just holes right there with his left hand and that and that with them that was part of the block and the Julius Jones needed right there so that was it that was a good call correct it was a tough block there for Quincy Morgan because he had that he had to come in and he had to make the block right there at the corner of attack walk the linebacker Salomon base coach second down and 14 it was a fiveyard game that part of it counts in a 10yard penalty second down and 14 screamed of Jones and they that Orlando huh with the tackle one thing you know Julius Jones isn't going to come out of the game and Bill Parcells is gonna he's gonna work him sell his contract he played with that broken shoulder he'll play with anything I think his tongue is starting to drag right now and I think right there he was looking along and way up the sidelines Bill Parcells is ignoring them maybe George's eat the cow about Julius Jones third and 14 and a big set what a great defensive stand that time by Seattle when they had to have one cheeky oh keeper they got the holding pool and then they're able to break up a screen and then they get a sack and they almost knocked the Cowboys out of field goal range right on the on the edge Chiqui oh keeper here on a torrent Tucker right here in the right side and you see he just he just runs right by him he gets him straightened up and then he can go right around him so the biggest play on that thing though was the penalty that called back to touchdown he played now Billy Cundiff from 47 and this one is his best shot of the night though only in terms of length but inaccuracies once one barely got one inside and up right but this time this one is good 15point game Dallas shaken up most of the season find out if he could go at it but right now the Dallas Cowboys points about 2914 and a spinning kick goes sound Bible reached Morris Seahawks will be good at their own 20 Mike Holmgren started his head coaching career with Green Bay Brett Favre of course was the man Mike was there from the very outset after he was fired far from Atlanta so 74 and 35 as the two of them could buy for that's Telemark Super Bowl appearances one win but was six other quarterbacks Mike's record is 48 and 46 hey maybe there's a lesson there too if you ever get a great quarterback stay put until he leaves though faced by a handful back and when he dropped over Dean by Sean Alexander now the dropped pass become as indigenous to Seattle as coffee and it seems like every time you watch the Seattle Seahawks and see guys dropping passes and that was my first image of the Seahawks as they've got passes all time that Sean Alexander who Mike Holmgren told us last night has to have a big night is having a terrible night the Sean Hannity last couple present fumbled the one to fall that then drop that past 14 thyristor Carrie and mr. Joey rice makes his presence known begin scored a touchdown earlier in the game covered there by Terrence Newman got it off to equip me to go to the Blitz speaking of the drop passes you've got this kind of a montage that you can look at time and again Darrell Jackson dropped a lot court Robinson was suspended right now he's been the culprit on a lot of occasions he's a little throws out into the flack go down he Jack again right there so they don't ask you all about drop boils into our from the 31 wide line that Jack and Darrell was close to a first down he's tackled there by Terrence Newman and Jackson having a nice night that's 99 yards for him on seven grabs and Mike Coleman was saying then you know Darryl Jackson has good hands it's just that you know he's thinking about running with the ball and that's when he has a problem this is it you know instead of looking the ball all the way in like he does there he's looking up to see where he's going to go the Seahawks have tried everything they even put numbers on the ball where they put like a five so you have to read the number as it comes in to you second everyone go back and repeat the step Alexander does hold on to the 40 the first mounted here's Michelle again the wide receivers coach as I told you earlier and I asked him about that about the drop passes he said they were trying to create big plays and lost focus for the football as you guys mentioned so the mantra this weekend practice has been catch it tuck it then were on and he wants these guys to catch the ball even if it means falling down right there on it and not running I get out double duty this week Alexander goes nowhere they add Nolan and Gill Haskell their offensive coordinator who's also been a special teams coach kind of helping out mark Michaels the special teams coach because Seattle's had a lot of problems in that area and I think I think that's a good idea anyway and you wonder why haven't you always been doing that Joe Haskell is the offensive coordinator a very good coach but special teams coaches need help sometimes I think that's you know the other coaches can just jump in and help like that's a live ball had he dropped it is that was a fact were passed and Alexander is able to make the catch and take it to the 50yard line broke out of the grasp to Hasselbeck of Leroy Glover but what was that spotlight tonight for Matt back to touch that passes both early Vinny Testaverde only 128 pass yards with more effective tonight Julius Jones another big game and the Cowboys have cashed it 213 off a couple two turnovers okay this cowboy defense is really playing well and they're getting good play from there inside tackle third annotate now for the 50 yard I didn't get to play off clock it run down delay a game the other thing I know that is big to the Cowboys it speaking to everyone the live game offense fiveyard penalty I know Vinny Testaverde talks about it built for ourselves doctor batters playing with a leaf you know now they can kind of play their football and they can do anything they can run it they can pass it they can you know slow the ball down slow the clock down slowly the tempo down go play action pass with bootleg Benny don't you get ahead your 2914 you have a move like this everything in your offense is a play you can use third and 13 behind online battle rush Nashville back yes of walk to their needs there and that enables them to complete of a bear is a flag that took so much time who those who might or might not have been downfield Jeremy Stephens made the catch but this one has the look of a play that will come back well I I see five offensive lineman and so a legal contact welcome back Lance Frasier with the contact I saw the five offensive linemen there and that's the first thing you think as they get an offensive lineman downfield and you see it's going to be Frazier right there number 30 that's after five yards and it's a hole if the thing that the Cowboys had think that having that clear mantle on is to make Hasselbeck throw in the eightman coverage becoming a groceries and stuff enough people under the ball blogs to a hole at the 20yard line a couple of inches shy of the first I think they're getting new I'm talking about the middle guys how they're doing a good job at getting pressure up the middle and stop on the run that time they they got the pressure right up the middle and they spun out of it here comes Brad Ellis he gave him problems early so they start to doubleteam he's going to fight that inside move they are going to jam him with the guard second in the shorter arm that's they're gonna come back strong the fullback forward progress gets him the first half 18 yard line stop by Coakley a little more than five minutes to go in the third period you know that's one thing you don't see much anymore is the fullback carry the ball I mean that's kind of a lost art yeah you win the end time you know team uses two backs usually one is the blocker and the other one's a runner remember there was a day when you had a fullback and a half back and they each got the ball about 50/50 now it's like 95 five first out of town Cowboys jumped but was Ellis induced by Chris Terri is the question well if it wasn't you wonder why they blew the whistle because he didn't look like he was unabated to the neutral zone infraction so that is Greg Alice he's the end man right here and the neutral zone is the football so so he's going to move and get into neutral zone right there see he's in the neutral zone now he made the offensive tackle move instead of being on the offensive tackle it goes to the thief that's a guy who jumps in the neutral zone but it was close enough I thought with the ball being snapped at that moment that they could have just called it on Ellison left Seattle want to play first and five Hasselbeck road matches me rice at the 7yard line and a first and goal now for Seattle on a very big drive very important this is the thing that Hasselbeck is a is a streak passer and that's what Bill Parcells was worried about is as the guy does get get hot and you see they had two receivers on that side the inside guy went to the outside the outside guy came underneath Matt Hasselbeck had good pass protection and hit him perfectly Dallas has been very porous in the exam of wait where's the roll call the pug Jackson last seven times at the Dallas opponents his hassle buddy comes up a little shake in the last seven times that the cowboy opponents have gotten into the red zone they've gotten into the end zone right but on that one I think Matt Hasselbeck cat of just throw that away because you talk about throwing into coverage there were three white jerseys where he threw that ball so it better be high and right out of the end zone there was no way that that was going to be a touchdown that's what I flipped back he hurt his hand yeah that's all he's grabbing him throwing the right hand right wrist with the left hand second down and goal so he gives the ball to Alexander and the William develops leg envenom by the the way Hasselbeck look Elena sure he could have gotten a good grip on the ball be she was holding his hand all the way up to the line of scrimmage Paul a running play analyses of the extra 45 seconds or so will Leyland to throw it watch Roy Williams here I mean when you have a guy who was an allpro or a top safety he has to make plays like this this is either going to be a touchdown for Alexander or a tackle by William Williams wins that battle third and go after the flowing down by Newman Anglin was the intended receiver and Hasselbeck had all he could handle in the backfield because of the Leonardo Carson rush and Mike Holmgren has to settle for a field goal at least come up and attempt a field goal the Cowboys are doing a good job of defense here in the end zone you see they make Hasselbeck step up and look at all those white jerseys in their tents Newman is a guy that knocked it down but look at all those white jerseys that are defending the end zone there's no flair for the green jerseys to go Brown for chip shot field goal of 21 yards so they come up with three to make it a 12point game 301 left in the third Dallas of 29 17 aerial coverage being provided by Budweiser with Qwest Field in Seattle really a magnificent field I know you hear you're always coming on saying oh it's beautiful new whatever I'm ranking this number one John I love the way they did this part you know Michael rivers that if it rains and it hasn't rained here the three years of the stadium seventy percent of the people don't get wet they're covered by the roof as rashard Lee runs it back flag is down on the play see what they did here I would call it they didn't make this luxury box dominant in other words you go in a lot of stadiums and it looks like they're top heavy with luxury suites and that the regular fans are sort of forgotten but here there's very first down what are those sweeps they have down there in the end zone what are those things fall those philia level sweet what kind of interest what red zone Suites where they're famous of course because that's where Terrell Owens went when we did a month and I came here two years ago after he scored a touchdown he went over to his business managers I recall and that's where you have the Sharpie instrument right in that area right you know where I'd hate to sit his way up on top of that single thing that goes up there you look like you're in an airplane up there for allowing the course of Microsoft Fame Dallas here's Jones the 33 Jones we asked him yesterday about the fact that he was passed over until the second round and then a lot of people thought well he was the wrong call buydown is he's really said I knew people thought I was a you know wasn't a good draft pick for the Cowboys and they should have taken this guy and not pass up on this guy and I knew that coming into it so you know I've always got something to prove every time I go out every game I go out have something to prove and uh you know I supposed to keep that chip on my shoulder that motivated me a lot of people thought the Cowboys should have drafted Stephen Jackson when they have the opportunity wound up going to st. Louis and a nice day yesterday is Testaverde retreats on first down and then a little bit behind Quincy Morgan and now an update on Julius Jones and what things look like tonight John you know Bill Parcells said that he was going to work I mean he's carried the ball 20 times so far for a hundred and thirty nine yards two touchdowns but you know he just shows great instincts you know and he's always long and with good balance I mean that's the big did you see how his shoulders are always down and he has good balance can wait for the blocks to develop and then cut off Dallben Hill the last rookie 100 yards two consecutive games throw down six now here come the hawk Cowboys do a nice job on the pickup and Keyshawn Johnson makes the grab so the Seahawks were coming the line did its work toppling off his Johnson but it's a first down and I'll tell you who else did his work as watch Julius Jones here this is the thing that you always worry about a running back can he pass protection can he pick up a blip because if he can't do that he can't play and Julius Jones did it and he did it perfectly to let Vinny Testaverde make that pass safety Piero is the pick no but that's the last thing that these rookie running back pick up those passed protection from the 44 for a sound for the Dallas Cowboys the tight end running laterally picks up about nine yards second and short of coming as we took down to the end of period three and here's Michelle I spoke with Jerry Jones about Julius Jones there's a lot of Jones there to talk about but in talking to him he said he was really debating he and for ourselves whether or not to put Julius Jones on injured reserve when he got that scape with that scapula fracture and they thought about because they weren't sure how quickly he'd heal al but they said they're so impressed by the way you battle through it and matured and that is performance way we have been courageous got to keep up with the Joneses but is Julius again that should be enough for a first down well you know the the one thing because his injury was a scapula he was able to do all his cardiovascular I remember when we're down there last time watch him in practice they had him over on that other feel and he was probably working harder than anyone else was you know and then I mean you know shouldering through his bad but at least you can do all those cardiovascular things right now the play clock is dead even with the game clock so they can let this tick down to the end of the quarter do not have to run a play and it looks like they all know that don't they they looked up simultaneous even the atomic clock ticked it down together whatever that means end of three 2917 Dallas and Monday night football resumed from Seattle after this message from our ABC stations Seattle is the site Al Michaels John man and Michele Tafoya Westfield start the fourth quarter ESPN a SportsCenter all the updates the Seattle Seahawks never been to a Super Bowl every one of her season game since 84 of Edition here the expectations are very high or at least happened big night to the 39 yard line Julius Jones coming off his 150 yard day against the Bears has 147 on the ground the night that's right you like an experienced offensive lineman watch Larry Allen here it's a it's a run to this side you see the motion here comes the Blitzer he just steps out picks up the Blitzer gets a lead block and Julius Jones just goes right to that side yo don't parse out the thing about Julius Jones if let's imbalance is often he is in perfect balance now 23 runs 23 passes second and four and that's a great play there by Nico could have Edy's the linebacker the rookies from Purdue and at the beginning of the game we talked about all of the injuries to the Seattle linebackers with Chad brown we lead the way they hope to have him back in a couple of weeks so if you drew a chart they would have their fifth sixth and seventh best linebackers in a storage and these are the guys that should be playing a special team for the and I think that's one of the things that the Cowboys have taken is these linebackers and railroad was saying that sometimes all these guys that he has in there he has three middle linebacker third and seven that'll be an interference call Marcus Trufant that time grabbing ahold of parents copper easy goal to make and will be a first down that's interference defense Terrence carpenter copper bill for ourselves was saying is the most improved player in the team he's a practice quad guy he gets up he plays special teams and as bill says whenever a guy does well on special teams then then he gets to make the trip then if he gets to make the trip then you're gonna play him in the game and he said every time I picked this guy in the game he makes plays for us here's a guy made a whole bunch of plays as me yeah x marks the spot goes to bed ready sits to the sideline chased by rishabh or Benny not a great runner no I mean not one of the alltime scramblers Benny happy to get to the sideline and get out of boundary by Italia for 41 years old I mean just just blogging to him last night I was talking about in the field before have you ever seen a guy that looked better no I mean and and he plays that way I mean there's no way that you could tell that Vinny Testaverde maybe on that last run there you'd say well you know he looks like a 40 year old guy wait a minute here's one other guy forward Jerry Rice everything looks better and stopped in his tracks that time as Julius Jones but for a quarterback well you know who Olson was think about the guys who played into their 40s one guys in the stadium tonight because he works on the Seattle radio board gets Warren Moon what Warren stated a really big statement yeah until the end and Warren was one of the area's there he is right there and he was one of those guys who played in Canada for a while and and then came down and had a long you have to be good I think you have to be toughen think you have to be a little lucky to not have the big injury get movin Flutie still active third and 14 and Dallas is going to take a timeout there first of the hand 12:19 left Dallas by 12 which got downtown Seattle Dallas's you're taking a timeout and third and 14 coming up as they try to at least get into field goal range here right now if you're looking at a 55 yard early probably without attempt Testaverde throws intercepted big play by the air early safety coming up with the interception then he gives it up and the Seahawks will try to mount a big comeback Jerald the arrow of his first career interception third year in the league the Cowboys have scored on five consecutive possessions and it ends right here then he was trying to throw that one to the left out of scramble F to the right and he made a commitment to throw the ball to the right and Barrera was just playing back there as a safety on the 28 yard line to the outside that's brought right makes the catch Jerry Rice was six taxes tonight Newman covers back to the interception we go let's write this again we talked about Vinny coming back here he's looking left looking left and now he doesn't have anything here so as he starts to go here he commits that he's going to throw the ball here's Barrera here he's just staying back there as a safety and you see he just gets a jump in the ball there's only one receiver over there four defenders he knows he can go for it from the 43 yard on and I feel bad it opened his Jeremy Stephens and Stephen towards their number one draft choice and has not been able to replace etool Amelie as the starting tight end flanks out and he's in the game because Miele was hurt earlier on a kickoff play 32 yard game you see that's when you drop a zone right there you're going to get a guy wide open here he is right here he's in the slide you see the wide receiver out here this side you see the zone is just dropped right there and here he is out here on this side excuse me the end a flag is thrown Jackson contacted by Lance Frazier all the way down the sideline and it's going to go against Frazier those Seahawks have something going now they caught on that on that last one they caught the the Cowboys are running with the inside leaving the outside guy go free and then you wonder when the Seahawks were going to start to work on Lance Frazier we talked to Mike Holmgren yesterday said that's one thing we're going to do is we're going to work on him and and they really haven't seen to and I think I think Lance Frazier has improved although dope ourselves was giving him a signal for uncatchable ball then it was overthrown too much 19 yard penalty plays you put the armbar on him foreskin goal and this is Alex the end zone just short and Alexander has a little making up to do here this this has not been a it hasn't even been an average night for Sean Alexander and this the closer you get to the goal line the better he is I mean he's a he's a touchdown scoring machine was bad averaging less than three per tone tonight second down and goal double tight end set up here look like he breaks the plane he years so it started down when the Cowboys know that I'm really impressed with this cowboy defense they they haven't been playing well all year remember last year they were they were number one in defense and and they came into this game and and they know that they have to stop the run that they have to stop Shaun Alexander and they have done a heck of a job of plugging up that middle Mike Zimmer the defensive coordinator Womack is in the game only a tackle in a tight end spot right here third down laughter fake Nashville bag rolling in trouble has to get lucky to the end zone that can't get Alexander and they're really I think compelled to go for it on fourth down and goal here a field goal the other thing is if you think you're going to go for it on fourth down I think that third down would have been a good running situation but Mike Holmgren is thinking well I'm going to go for it on fourth down so let's go play action pass if they want to sell out against Sean Alexander then we'll fake to him and we'll throw the ball Sean Alexander didn't sell out on that found that run Fagin fourth and goal they come up tight a little cost Alexander and Alexander's will his way into the end zone he was going to get spot it looked like he ran into his old guy might not get in there but he willed his way well they tried that middle and it has been plucked up and have been plugged up all night so they said let's get to the outside they'd get a good block there Roy Williams gets knocked a little beyond Alexander so he can cut off that block the guy that has to make this play is Roy Williams right there when he doesn't make it it's going to be a touchdown Brown for the point after Seahawks make it a five point game he had a lot of stuff going on on that play looked like he was running into his own man there's a penalty here on the extra point get it off side against Dallas on the kickoff it'll be enforced but you had Alexander looked like he was going to be stopped look like he was running into his own guy and side defense the points good yard will be assessed on the kickoff looks like the ball was coming loose as well take a look at this yeah I think you said it right he willed himself in there al big big touchdown find out who the player of the year is as well take off that free yard line Rashard the lead and if charlie takes it back up to the 32 yard line and tonight we've had Sean Alexander miked up everybody was inside Alexander has had a hot and cold night as Testaverde has it dropped by Quincy Morgan who was going down couldn't hang on a second ban of ten it's interesting you always talk about how turnovers kill you the Cowboys had everything going then he Testaverde throws that interception and that and that puts the Cowboys down a little gives the Seattle Seahawks a new way they take the ball down and score a touchdown with it well they come in the game in which Dallas really tries to keep its playoff hopes alive Seattle's trying to stay in first place ahead of the Rams in the NFC West period Vinny will be bound by the that was grant whisperer and he watched him for years speed it's all about speed and he was in there so quickly then he got twisted around and finally finished or you know it's about that 110 miles an hour to that he just keeps going he didn't get him on the first shot he starts outside then he's going to come inside underneath flows well at him now watch he kind of misses him here but he keeps going keeps going and right there he just grabs her one more time grabs that right ankle and takes him down rise to say and that's that's what we needed we needed that sack but that's the verde is the shaken up cowboy right here see what flows doll Adams did the left back well you can't do you can't jump out on that thing you have to keep your inside foot up looks like they're taking Vinny a Polly he has to come out I think he wanted to stay in but he because of an injury timeout which is not a charge timeout it stops the clock and if that was the pole here that Henson does have to come in for at least one play so he does once once the trainer's come out on that field and he has to go out he's that stops the clock not only does he have to go out but I mean about true Hansen happened to come in now on third and long that's like coming into the ninth inning with a bases loaded to try to save a game and account is 3 and Oh third and quanti here Timothy Jones on a draw and look at this Julius picks up a good percentage of that 20 but not enough for that in the punch I think that was a good play call a good run by Julius Jones and it was he it was a play that that drew Henson had to do or Bill Parcells had to call that was the play when you wouldn't want him back there and a big pass rush running for his life do this get a good punt your defense is playing well Matt McBride to punt we build a hundred fiftyfour and the guy who used to play Australian rules football thankful and gets a decent role it's picked over the 23 and then the Dallas Cowboys don't recover the ball see it the Seattle Seahawks carvers unit came down I think it was michael boulware who touched it there was a beanbag down earlier a cowboy may have touched the cowboy touched it first so therefore it's a play run for the CFDA gun the men in the cowboy he touches it that was pretty close that was up 29 2014 Budweiser good ballgame Dallas which had scored 26 in Criminal Court now in a dogfight she honor God by Firefox and the football at the 28 yard line first time tip back to the punty can see where the cowboy touches the ball and that will then to play an effect right here now you'll see 29 here Keith Davis then the ball is going to bounce up and hit him right in the chest now once it hits him it's really a free ball for the Seattle Seahawks they can pick it up and run with it and even if they fumble see that that's a free play there because even if they fumble the ball comes back to where it hit the cowboy on the punt team same thing as a line of scrimmage player the defensive loss on the play both concept they were second on 10th on the 28 yard line that's the bike out of bounds 33 Bill Parcells through the years when he has a lead in the fourth period almost unbeatable 79 and one leading by 12 or more points in the fourth quarter which was the case here tonight at 29 17 that one loss back in 85 when he was a coach of the Giants to the brown well you know the one thing that you look at Bill Parcells career at the Giants and me and the Patriots in the jacket he's always had pretty good defense there than 5 and that's Terrell Jackson making the cash he said good defense and he's also had he's had that runner that could take him to the final gun to or a Terrence Newman was really off with Jackson on that play there was just man to man and that's really too much cushion because you can see where the first down line is Jackson knows where he has to go to run that slant Hasselbeck knows it and he hits it now I think that I think carrots movement is a better point than that and if you're a better player than that and you're mantoman a third down you can't give that much pushing Jackson eight catches for 108 yards the facts of Maurice Morris as they give Alexander a break Morris the number to pick thirdyear guy out of Oregon who's been running back kickoffs for the CEO of auxin see some action of the backfield here here comes Alexander again you're always talking about the running game and me and the running back and and to me it's it's when you do it to win the game you know how do you run in the fourth quarter how do you stop the run in the fourth quarter this this is him you need these clothes if they're good colors they played right now second and four Hasselbeck very right you know because Barbara Ingram is in the same area Jerry Rice and Bobby awareness later hassleberry we talk about great players that make plays you see Jerry right with the outside receiver right there and you see England was coming first angle thought he was thrown to him Jerry Rice his country starix I love the old mouthpiece came flying out 33 yard games over a hundred yards its first down and ten and hassle by throw he's covered that time by Frazier and John when you look at a play like that I mean when the two receivers are in the same neighborhood normally somebody has screwed up the pattern well and someone did screw up that pattern because there's no way that you would ever draw up a pattern where you would put two receivers together so what would you guess me my guess would be it was Jerry Rice really yeah I would guess it was Jerry Rice because you know he's the new guy and you see he started because he did cuz I think England was going to run a corner 9:04 closer to 20 or swam across on second and 10 Jeremy urban storage the touchdown and go for two to make it a threepoint game well reserves were going to work Lance Fraser who thought Oh big he is a fake goodlooking widereceiver though he said he's too big for Frasier he just kind of takes him on physically and once he gets to that position inside Matt Hasselbeck note that he has an easy throw that's what you liked about these big receivers they can they can one white toast now defensive backs coverage Trinity in Texas living a dream Sam before they anything babies on Monday night the photos giving him to leave twopoint play here Jackson up by three the Seattle Seahawks have come from behind bigtime 32 to 29 Seahawks started High Cowboys then took over in the second and third quarters but the Seahawks have just regained the Seattle the 529 to going to kick off coming down to the shard lead we backed up to the we're talking about the NFC and how close it is right now division leaders Philly Atlanta they'd have the buys Green Bay and Seattle at the moment on top two wildcard leaders are Minnesota and st. Louis and then that old passel of teams at five and seven five of them in fact that down was trying to be the six in the meantime we got Reisen Angermann and jeremy orbitons on a practice run in his first career start a month ago scoring the goahead touchdown Testaverde time to leave him back good defense there Morgan has it extracted by Ken Lucas with his a flag that in the secondary you're watching that Jerry Rice dances it doesn't look like a big old wide generation gap there does there nope the 20year veteran and some of these guys were like two or three years old when he started me NFL kid like Jeremy Irvin and rice hates that coy who that call that's ten Lucas and Lucas is a good corner and what he does is is he loses position SIA once you lose that position then you have to try and go through the guide and if you do it after the ball gets there it's okay if you do it a split second before it says it's a penalty there's Joan Marcus Trufant the first one whisper man at the end there again max grant whisper him coming all the way across the field and that's that's the effort I think when the Seattle Seahawks went and went after grant Wistrom this is the kind of play they want in this kind of situation a guy that lines up on this side goes inside the balls going across the field you could pull up any time to run all the way and run right through the ball here and he's been playing hurt he was heard at the beginning of the year played like second down and ten let's keep n sebastian here and that's Keyshawn Johnson who can't handle it third down and ten he wente you look at your momentum Vinny Testaverde throws that interception to be area they get the ball back they score and they just kind of take over the game again and then they you just feel what the Cowboys have lost it and they're fighting to get back into this that was the fulcrum game went from the Cowboys right over to the Seahawk third down and ten nation women lives up in the back here here they keep them in for pass protection Testaverde intercepted by toothpicks last week against Buffalo they call him the hammer and he just may have delivered one Rudy's really mixing up these coverage as well see this is his own you have the corn the bumpin handling just get sitting back there and reading since that covered to the corner bump handle is just sitting back there and reading and just like the other interception he sees Vinny what he sees Vinny throw and then he gets the jump on it big big big play then the 41 thinking about the clock and looking ahead down which has two timeouts plus the twominute warning Testaverde this season no pecs in the first then three in the second five on the third and the fourth quarter has really been tough for him and usually that was because they were playing uphill because they were behind they didn't have the running game and those types of things but that's not an excuse for tonight right and both those intersections were the same thing it was a his own coverage just throwing it high over his receivers had to a safety pass three possessions with Dallas in the suction pump intercepted where's da da I first thought tackle by Newman stays in bounds keeps the clock rolling I think that's what Seattle has to do because they need a first down here and they're going to have to throw to get it because the Cowboys are just daring them to throw the ball they have eight men up they got everyone you're close to the line of scrimmage to stop the run if they're giving them anything it's a path and I think of the Seahawks are going to get a first down tried it on second down they have to come back on third down throw the ball big conversion attempt here if they can make it to get a forced Dallas to use its timeouts on defense and it's caught by angle and then anger miss stop short of the first down he is stopped there by Nathan Jones this is a this is a big decision here for Mike Holmgren to do do you you go for it on fourth down or do you attempt the field goal he doesn't look like he has any move to attempt the field goal he'd be looking at about a forty nine yards field goal is it the downside of course is that and he takes the time out here which the clock have been stopped on the out of bounds play the downside is if he misses it then the Cowboys get the ball in pretty good position at about the 39 yard line that's the downside fourthquarter with Dallas holding the lead and then that pick in the traffic with us for defensive back there Alexander is able to pay it all off on a tough one then it's Urban's touchdown the foots of a head and then that most recently Testaverde x' interceptions so fourth down and 1 now with 253 Seattle has one timeout Cowboys chef and the twominute warning and I think if they go for it which they're going to try here I would I would guess it would be a passport and I don't know that I would see a real comfortable running Sean Alexander because because the Cowboys are going to load up in the run and if they if they are going to give you something they're going to give it to you still in the console game not in look out social out of the line of scrimmage little one they're going to give it to Alexander he's going to get it and as often is the case in the play like that get all of the rest Cowboys were in there with their with their goal line defense six defensive linemen we're talking earlier about left tackle Sean Alexander runs right in behind him so 15 touchdowns now for Alexander the first man in NFL history 15 or more in four straight years and as I said fourth and one and very often once you get past the line of scrimmage away you go you're right because they're all up there and they're all selling out and and I mean if you get that practice there's going to be a crack and there is that crack right there you're going to take it to the end zone Sean Alexander came they had a slow start and of an average middle that's this ending is very very good and one of the reasons you see a guy like max strong gets so much credit and yet the unknown is the blocking through on Alexander cutting inside of it the scores the Dallas have scored 26 unanswered points and Seattle has answered with 25 straight points you know just say that that's what Mark Strong is in there for and that's the guy you have to block do because if someone's going to make the play on short yardage of goal line it's probably going to be Roy Williams mark Strong took care of Roy Williams so 39 to 29 now boys two timeouts and the two minutes 7 yard line which hardly and Sean Alexander showed you earlier guys who scores 15 or more so that puts them into solo company just him got a quarter of the season to go but he hung in there in this game I mean this game wasn't really good for him early like I said he had to fumble you know he dropped the past things when going wasn't much running room but he just stayed with it and stayed with him stay with him and that last one was a big big one and he has that one thought by Terrence copper Marcus Trufant with the coverage have always go without a huddle laughter because they're thinking key spores now they have to be thinking he'll get get us four then get an onside kick then get another score second down in the water they get the first down to the 45yard line of the Seattle Seahawks and I think with the Cowboys meaning beating two scores it can be a day a 7 and a 3 or it can be a three and a seven I think if you get in that field goal range you take that field goal and give yourself some time for another score they have 120 seconds to move down the field two times down by ten two timeouts left here in Seattle on Monday Night Football first and ten from the 45 then he swings it outside the Jones his first priority is to get out of bounds and stop that clock and he gets the first down to boot to the 39 yard line and again I don't think that the Cowboys want to take all their time trying to score a touchdown and not leaving any time for the onside kick and the second score if you get it so I think this is something that you keep trying to get the ball out of the bound get the ball to the end zone if you don't you kick the field goal from the 34 yard line Benny he's looking for the 7 here is inbound is Keyshawn Johnson sucks damn Dallas your people can tell you all the things that Keyshawn Johnson can't do that is one of the things that he can do he can outjump you on the jump ball and that's all that was I mean Vinny Testaverde had time he looked downfield he saw Keyshawn Johnson he just throws it up in the end zone this is just a jump ball Keyshawn Johnson wins he wins with the era who had the early interception trying to swat it away and couldn't and B era was in pretty good position there I mean he got he got his hands up there too but Keyshawn Johnson didn't bring it down to his hands the era with the point after they don't have to onside kick if they so choose because you have enough if the man will tell you you've got two timeouts so you could get the ball back here's the play again yeah here's Keyshawn Johnson he's in the slot here and you'll see Yoda zone defense er they're in quarters and Keyshawn Johnson just runs right by Kiara Vinny Testaverde buys a little time See's Keyshawn Johnson near the end zone and just throws a jump ball up to him you know that was very that I'm looking at this thing last two minutes it's up to the guys upstairs he can't challenge if you're a coach he had one foot in the hand looked like it came then at about they could have also ruled that the use of the contact you had to force out component here as well but I'm very surprised they didn't stop play to look at that very that's something that you can't say that the that the coach had to do there now replays telling us a leg in an ankle all right let's see here's your leg here's your possession there's there's the elbow already in the end zone so they can make it up after the fact but I'm shocked they didn't stop it and frankly if they looked at it another time when the elbow hits before the ankle hits he wasn't in bounds not only you're you are you shocked but you're right yeah the elbows hit the elbow hit out of bounds before the ankle came down in bounds and an elbow has always equal to Phoenix cookin they came up with the onside kick Jason Witten and you talk about a quiet crowd I mean this crowd was going crazy when they went to Seahawks were women and then Keyshawn Johnson makes that touchdown and then this play this crowd is in shock Wow what beautiful that it's a heck of an onside kick when you want to get that thing no one hit jason witten he just runs right through him Testaverde this little swinging to the outside through the hands of jones I think Dallas Dallas still has two timeouts and a minute 40 so time is not of the essence here I mean they can they can just kind of methodically move the ball down the field I'm just thinking as we're going through this the rule says you have to let a guy in position to catch and on SciTech matches for them from making he can make a fair catch second down in 10 and this is Jones for the 48yard line the bottom line here is that I'm an onside kick if the Seattle player would have called for a fair catch they would have had to have let him make it but does he know he just tries to make the catch so let's Whitney who is perfectly though now Morgan makes this catch and he's taken down after picking up the first down meanwhile here's a freezeframe but you see his ankle is up it's not down and his forearm is in the end zone he was out of bounds but that one is gone gone and not forgotten begun first and 10 at the 36 yard line going through the 33 and only mean is three to send it to OT Dallas has they have two timeouts I think what your goal here is you you want to get in in field goal position where you feel that we can make the field goal from here then you want to take shots at the end zone you always want to give your self a twoway go either the the seven or the three this is another break for Dallas because they don't have to expend the time out and do the injury under two minutes gets injured so that cost Seattle its final timeout they have none Sean Payton going over things with Testaverde here with 58 ticks and now he's going over things with Bill Parcells and I think I think that here I don't necessarily think you have to go for the end zone I think you go and try and get another first down then if you get another first down that puts you in good field goal position and then from that point you go to the end zone where I try to get maybe 12 to 15 yards with relatively comfortable position to send the game into overtime I see Marcus tough zaire number 90 it's his leg bent all the way back look at that I mean he's put in a position where you wear a big guy where anyone doesn't bend that way Marcus Tubbs was was just coming on for the Seahawks he had started the last couple games and another talking to Ray Rhodes about him the other day and he said that he'll they thought he'd be a run stopper and he's even given a little pass rush now Cowboys home next week against New Orleans then at Philly and wash them in at home then at the Giants meanwhile his Tubbs gets assisted off the field they go to Minnesota indoors next week then across country to the Jets and end at home against Arizona and Atlanta here if you play up here in Seattle in the National Football League you're always going to have more travel yard prattle miles than any team in league unless you not even close San Diego they'd be fairly close there's no real close game for this second down and eight that's the worthy stephannie the whole baby was he lucky can Lucas that's that's the thing that Benny Testaverde has to know is is it you can have a turnover here and you can't take a sack and you can't take a penalty and it's kind of tough to throw it inside I would from now on from this point on the rest of the game I would eliminate inside throw because that's where they're happened to trouble and having trouble with that corner come underneath and they're having a trouble with that safety D I wouldn't throw a ball in the middle of field now third and eight key key play Jones first down to the 18 so they're in field goal range for sure now tackled by Lucas they still have their two timeouts and Vinny's going to spend one right here let's say you're Julius Jones for a rookie for any running back has really impressed me tonight that you know when he's had to use speed and quickness he's used it when he had to run a delay and have a little patience here like this he's had it he always stays low he's moving all the time making big big play this guy busts Florida's career looks like something pretty special already has 29 carries for 181 yards and two touchdowns so far cells were saying I you know I can't have a run 30 times every game but I think if you don't put in one of those other backs you're probably going to have him run 30 times every game I'm just 29 right now with that he I don't know if I was sucked out I think from this point on throw the ticket from the 79 but the plays they swatted down grant Wistrom got a hand on it second down and ten talking to Julius Jones last night he'd actually flunked out of Notre Dame a year and a half ago but then he got his grades up and he said we talking about ty Willingham getting fired and he said boy I owe that man a lot because he stays in the spot get your grade straight down there'll be a scholarship in a spot for you on this team second down and ten then I give it to Jones shows touchdown Dallas big big run they caught grant Wistrom he was trying to slant down to the inside Julius Jones saw but he didn't have that Hall so he took the next hole to the outside boy was that a great read his 30th carry of the game gives him 198 yards he's exhausted but the Cowboys are ecstatic two touchdowns in 214 we're a big extrapoint because that means Seattle has to score a touchdown not a field goal and they'll have to do it in 32 seconds without a timeout Vinny Testaverde raised his hands touchdown the minute he he handed this thing off you watch it right here he raises his hands and Julius Jones was still 10 yards from the endzone but see grant Wistrom takes the inside now when Julius Jones reads it he's going to the inside he knows that he knows he could take it up there and then bounce it to the outside look at his eyes he's looking up and down looking at seeing what's going to happen imagine what he's going to get and then he gets it and the Jones family exultant well you know we were talking about the horse trailer we were talking about a Seattle Seahawk and you wanted to mused and I'm glad you you saved some time for musing well you know why I'm thinking too dismisses at a racetrack they would say unhorse number whatever jockey switch Jerry Rice has been taken off the horse and the mountain out goes to Julius Jones yeah and I would I would I would agree with you and that's that's good music I mean you can't you can't let out all your hosts tell you know where the fire is I mean you can't commit and say that this is it until it's all over right where's Yogi Berra said number over 1200 yeah 32 seconds here yeah so we better just keep on using yeah we haven't made a decision yet a half minute of music noe Suarez from the three yard line to the 25 28 seconds now makes the catch loses the football at the 46 yard line but no they're going to sit down the play is over but they can't stop the clock they've got to get up there and Spike it spike it in the meeting one more play down to single digits he's got a spike in use as is here so barring a penalty on the defense I don't know how they can get it into the end zone without getting it in on this play here's Jerry Rice's catch he catches it on that back shoulder and he's trying to get it up to the front when he gets unloaded on by that when Jerry Rice's limp it off the field that hurt so he can't be in on the final with figures to be the final play of the game 47 yards seven seconds the gun is Hasselbeck he shot Johnson's backup safety national that will unload marry for a jump ball swatted down initially by the cowboy defender and the game is over I think it was Linscott who got us the first guy to touch it nobody could get the carom and water game to coaches we know what it's like the lifting Lombardi throw be Hasselbeck goes back a long way as does the family with Parcells and his dad Don Hasselbeck and here is Julius Jones the sudden star you've got Kevin Jones in Detroit he's a pretty good running back had a crate day yesterday and then Julius Jones of the Dallas Cowboys the new star in the Lone Star State Nathan Jones Lynch Scott are all there hit angrily oh right there and yes so they had it after all that watch it when it comes down and hits Bobby anger right there right in front of them Jeremy Urban was there in the rainy line as well and for the Seahawks that sums up the night they were down early they come back had a big lead and then in the end it's the Dallas Cowboys
