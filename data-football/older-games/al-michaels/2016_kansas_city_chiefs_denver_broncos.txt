Announcer: Al Michaels
============================================================

during that rain kickers have told me that went well it could add when they're kicking with it we could add anywhere from 6 to 10 yards to their distance so that's something to watch 1 on the injury front Denver ease without versatile safety TJ Ward he is without with a concussion linebacker Brandon Marshall will miss his third straight game with a hamstring injury and tight ends Virgil green and AJ Derby are both out also with concussions and for Kansas City linebacker Justin Houston who was so good at three Sachin that first matchup in week 12 between these two teams he is out tonight with a knee injury I think there's a big names look at the two coaches now if the Broncos win they remain alive for a playoff berth and the Raiders would clinch the AFC West if the Chiefs win they remain alive for the AFC West title the Broncos are eliminated and the Miami Dolphins will be in Cairo Santos to kick off Kansas City won the toss and they have deferred one bit of an improvement over last week when they kicked off last week Kansas City against Tennessee it was 1 degree one tonight it's 51 that works yet for us personnel down there for sure so Arrowhead Stadium Christmastime already Rocking as the tick will be filled in at the 5yard line taken down at the 22 yard line and we'll take a look at the Denver offense Trevor Simeon Northwest Justin Forsett cow Demaryius Thomas Georgia Tech Emmanuel Sanders SMU Jordan Norwood Penn State Jeff heuerman the Ohio State University Russell Oakland Oklahoma State Max Garcia Florida Matt Paradis Boise State Michael Scofield Michigan Donald Stevenson Oklahoma that offensive line has been in the crosshairs so are the ranked at the position through week 15 and we start with a run and we start with Justin for seven start of the season with Baltimore and then went to Detroit and came here three weeks ago so Simeon you know the story seventh round draft choice sat on the bench inactive all of last season gets the starting job he's been pretty good 16 touchdowns eight interceptions the rating is okay all things considered pretty happy with him problem has been that offensive line and no running game second down and seven play action is time and spins it out incomplete intended for poor set and that will make it third down and seven for the Broncos well last time it was Justin Houston this time it's going to be D Ford here's a guy that had the hamstring injury and ten sacks earlier this season hasn't had one since that injury so one of the key matchups can they keep D for off of Trevor Senate simian got sacked five times in the game at Denver a month ago Alex with us sacked 6times 37 from the 25 wash shimmy why into his left nice move by heuerman to pick up the first down so there a couple the tight ends and heuerman has to get the start a nice move there to pick up the first a nice job here by trevor simeon as well it feels a little pressure coming over here to his right just slides away from it that's the kind of protection they need here tonight and for Jeff firemen he's the only tight end sort of left standing on this team he's going to get a lot more action than he has all season long as Michelle mentioned Virgil green AJ Derby both inactive tonight injured so we'll see a lot of higher men now we see a draw here force it runs into his own man and can go nowhere as he runs into the tack on the kansas city defense Rakeem new year Oh Jeff so the myth I'm sorry Paul mint is Cristo Mitsuda state D for hopping University DJ Alexander or his state Verma Clausen George brings on Bo Central Michigan Martin's B is West Oakland California Eric Berry Tennessee wrong Parker Buford high school Terrence Mitchell Oregon come up without a huddle the pass for Sanders is low on outside and incomplete to make it third down to ten there's a few different looks out here for the Kansas City Chiefs one at the quarterback position this young man number 39 Terrence Mitchell has made some nice plays for them you would think though despite the fact that he's played very well over the last couple weeks that if they get a chance to go after him early that would be a clear option picking the spot normally occupied by Philip Games who has lit up in that game in Denver last month simian under pressure throws a wobbly pass maven deflected Chris Jones put the heat on probably got a piece of it and it's fourth down so one first down and now they're forced to punt Chris Jones is turned into a superstar in this league and he did this to Michael Scofield in the first matchup between these two teams he's too big he's too strong and as much as they want to help those tackles on the outside somebody has to come up with an answer for Chris Jones inside and somebody better come up with an answer if they're going to punt it to Tyreke Hill the gamebreaker standing back to the 25 ride addiction takes the low snap this is a line drive dead and Hills gonna let it bounce and it will bound outofbounds at the 23 yard line so 2:10 into the game that's where Smith and company take over at Arrowhead Sunday Night Football being brought to you by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance by H&amp;R Block get your taxes won by Volkswagen and by Capital One hit the Quicksilver card that is the multitalented outside linebacker for the Chiefs one three four to play on the piano since II was 12 years old pretty good how much would you give to be able to do that yeah especially during the holidays brother 23 yard line they give the ball to Spencer where they're leaving the ground gainer takes it through the 28th as the rain begins to come down Michelle talking about the moveable feast that is the weather tonight Alex Smith another good year form the numbers are very similar almost year after year it completes about twothirds of his passes six more yards tonight will be over 3,000 to the one touchdown to interception ratio is that front moves through in the rain Tyreke Hill lines up in the backfield on second down and sexy fake it cool then the outside the kelsey their leading receiver and he gets taken down by to lead but not until he picks up very close to a first down now used to call some NBA games remember the old twoman game just basically two guys that's what this offense is turned into if you're gonna end up baking at the Tyreke kill are you gonna get it to out there on the outside with Travis Kelce and those two guys are really the main weapons on this offense you're gonna see Alex Smith get the ball out of his hand very quickly try and take away the pass rush of the broncos cuz 474 passes this year and he'll we could break the game open at any time and here he goes he'll to midfield and all the way to the Denver 40yard line anytime he gets the ball in his hands look out Dean 229 Von Miller arguably the Defensive Player of the Year no way is going to catch up with Tyreke he'll watch out fast he is I mean it was born basically just looking at him and knowing it was coming and he still could not catch up to it and we have seen that time after time game after game and when he turns the corner he looks like somebody in the 200 meters Usain Bolt or something it's the fantastic talent splits wide to the right this time Denver 41 yardline where is the running back to the 21 yard line go Spencer wears on his way to maybe a thousand yard season is going to be close that's a gain in nineteen well they've got another answer for von Miller here now they're going to bring the tight in across the block hem and pinned it right back in behind on that inside zone play so they are going to try and do things basically to leave bond Miller alone you can't block them so what's the next best thing to do to leave them out there isolated and attack them in different ways another on the sidelines 23 yard line Smith those hill to come on inside there's got to keep company with to get to the outside this time he can't turned back in by Nelson as we take a look at the Casey offense Alex Smith University of Utah spends aware LSU Jeremy Maclin Mizzou Chris Conley Georgia Tahil Pearson gelatin Travis Kelce Cleveland Heights Ohio Eric Fisher Central Michigan Zach Fulham Tennessee Mitch Morris Missouri Gohan's Donna Tubbs if McGill University Mitchell Schwartz Cal and the rain is lightened up over the last minute a half or so at second down and 11 number 24 the C's first drive for Kansas City tonight the first down is Travis Kelce we're back to the twoman game this time the safety Terrence Stewart and he's just going to come in here and just run a simple little post route remember TJ Ward is out a guy often times would be out there playing that sort of man coverage and this has been surgical light so far for Alex Smith in the Kansas City Chiefs since Kelsey notsohappy last week when he got just one target in sight he wasn't very happy with the boycott all the way through first and goal from the ten Smith's gonna keep it himself the outside he goes through the touchdown kosuna the block to lead the way Smith who did a lot of running in the past but very little this year around the end for the touchdown yeah just the read option he's got the choice to hand it or to keep it off the other side and then it's really left on the outside to Travis Kelce to make the block against the young rookie Justin Simmons filling in for TJ Ward there is just hanging in front looking a little like a basketball player and no problem what an opening drive for the Kansas City Chiefs five runs two passes 77 yards in seven plays Kairos Athos for the point after and six verse into the game on this Christmas Sindel a Kansas area sevens another don't miss a moment of tonight's game with the NBC sports app you can watch the game anywhere live on your laptop tablet connected TVs or at Union Station here in Kansas City Missouri beautiful Christmas time right here closet sparking this Christmas season as the dick is filled it by layman in the end zone though the offense and the defense to the back to well last year 19th and pointspergame points allowed per game they were fourth to the disparity not much to do it on the offensive side last two weeks they took care of Mariota and Brady holding them to the low average days but lost ball games 13 points scored in that few games span the illicit suits back in lane so that led to a little bit of consternation after the game in Denver last week when they lost the New England Simeon retreats and he hooker and yard games in school to the 41yard line and how do you best slow down a pass rush that gave you fits last time little scream pass just come on out here so just invite the rust to come flying up the field and dump it out they needed that good first play there on first down to get them going next Garcia with a good block the left guard again a 16 hooker the fourth round wiki out of Utah backtoback first downs to the Kansas City 47 yardline and this is what the Denver defense is looking for the offense to do with regularity and they should be able to because without Derrick Johnson on the defensive side of the ball teams have been running over there at that left side like that DJ Alexander last week and now they bring to safety Daniel Sorensen and expect more of that tonight plays first downs on this Drive turning around Jordan Taylor looking for a flag gets none of course last week as the story went Russell Kuhn got up and was shouted down in the locker room by a Keith the lead and is always the case with the teen in that sort of situation there who cooling it in down playing it yeah Gary Kubiak begs basically said is anybody want to say something Russell oh Coon got up to say something himself and that was it second to ten sitting close and that's batted at the line of scrimmage look you were in a locker room for eight years with the Bengals and University of Florida and all of that that's not the first time it's ever happened right it's not but you have to keep an eye on that team the next week and see what's going on right because sometimes a I've been on teams where our offense was great our defense was bad and vice versa so you're gonna live both side today Gary Kubiak said it was nothing he was like Chris come on but let's say this this is a team to keep an eye on right now because they look a little divided Sicilian to take the snap on a third and ten out of the shotgun he uses the shotgun with less frequency than almost every other quarterback in the league Jason throws into traffic and that's incomplete and just to put a button on that story we talked to Simeon about that he said I don't even know what happened in the lock I'm had to read about it afterwards well it was interesting because Trevor sent me in basically said because it wasn't a whole lot I didn't think it's a whole lot then I started reading about in the paper and I said did I miss something did something else happen so who knows I mean it was a great story they talked about it all week and if it they end up losing this game tonight he's gonna become a barrister Bradley Dixon rookie at a Syracuse this time who can only bring it back to about two 18 yard line where Kansas City will take over their second drive upcoming leading 7 to nothing at home it's a new celebrity of breakfast with the banished boss in town arnold schwarzenegger joined by celebrities including former NFL star Ricky Williams and Eric Dickerson Celebrity Apprentice premiering Monday January the second right here on NBC starts to rain again walking on happy last another hour or so from the 19 yard line this Drive starts with a Spencer where won your game let's take a look at the Denver defense their full Cincinnati Sylvester William Morrow and Jared crew Nebraska home Miller Texas A&amp;M Cory Nelson University of Oklahoma Todd Davis Sacramento State DeMarcus Ware Troy a key to lead Kansas will Parks Arizona Darian Stewart South Carolina Chris Harris Joyner Kansas Jayhawks and they drove over that defense the one and only Wade Phillips in the old time really great guys in the NFL second down and nine this is caught over the middle and taken in there by Kelsey well it should be a first down Parkes makes the stop Reid falls in the next play just doesn't matter who it is that they have autumn you end up out here oneonone against Travis Kelce and they are gonna take it that time the other rookie will parks out there trying to guard him they try it Justin Simmons they have tried every different way but when he gets oneonone matchups that's where they're gonna go right there to Travis Kelce they don't give him the first down about a half yard shy they come up in the eye with a fullback Anthony Sherman where is the first down at the 30 yard line for Kansas City well it has been the quick pass game of Alex Smith that makes this office work the fastest in the NFL you can barely catch the ball throw it in 2.25 seconds but that's what alex smith does and here are the numbers on the left hand side you can clearly see 2.5 seconds or less a much better quarterback than he is when he holds it longer so that's the style they play with Alex Beth that information coming to you from the world headquarters of pro Football Focus Tyreke he'll to the outside he goes to catch him no they cannot he's done it seventy yards and the fireworks though up he's his old fireworks show Wow looking to say about this guy right now looks like Bullock Bob Hayes watch out deep in the hole egos and then just runs the loop the 200 meters coming out he's all the way deep in the hole and then loops all the way back out around those blockers and then look at that move there's Travis Kelce helping his bait look at him putting Darian Stewart right on his back this is an emotional team let's face it it's hard to say but the Oakland Raiders and the Derek Carr injury they think they are going to win this division well they could if they win tonight win in San Diego next week in Denver beat Oakland that a great cheap job there on the safety Justin Simmons along the way and as was the case last week against Tennessee came to city scores on its first two possessions with last week only three points the rest of the game when they lost not 14 letters well quit and this is my wife Chrystia my son Brinkley Colston Hartley Kinsler Cannon and we're wishing Chiefs Kingdom and NFL fans around the world Merry Christmas the kicking Colquitt family dad with a couple of Super Bowl rings when he kicked for the Steelers in the late 70s playing like this they may get one for him too SOT those two could go off in the six yard line to sprint away Santos is there and he's able to force him out of bounds near midfield with a good run back and that's exactly what they need and you know you down by 14 you're not scoring they have 13 points in the last couple of games if you're the Denver Broncos right now what are you trying to do well the Denver Broncos first of all are probably looking over at their defense and saying hey where are you guys right now so it works both ways but that kickoff return was big now they need to put something together they've moved the ball here a little bit but Trevor Simeon remember the big day he had against this defense they're fully capable he's outside receivers though that her their best players have to get ball he had his best day of the season and that overtime loss and now through the left side knows Devante smokers who are getting up close to eat back there by Wilson you know we hit up into sorry ah we hit on it just a little bit Derek Johnson being out at the middle linebacker for Kansas City a huge deal on that side of the ball now they've got Terrence Smith in there a guy that had zero defensive snaps so that running game that way is got to be part of the equation for the Broncos tonight but we're again flag is down so it here from tony correctiy for the first time tonight it's always a good thing when it's 10 minutes and 25 seconds into the game you haven't heard from the ref yet Paul Sartre augments the left guard fiveyard penalty not good news from Max Garcia it's always a good thing to hear from Tony currentday no matter what one of the better officials out here working with his crew on Christmas night Gary Kubiak the head coach in effect he'd be the offensive coordinator he calls the plays that's just been agreed longtime back up to John staying career simian eyes we walk the hands of Booker to make a third down and seven can't miss that one you know this is an offense that doesn't have that much leeway and Simeon trying to look left and throw right but can't miss that one so now the big playmaker in that first game was Emmanuel Sanders we haven't heard from him at all so number 10 coming down here to the bottom of this is a guy that had a tremendous game and so far nothing to speak of Semyon in the rain now is 2 of 9 to 25 yards they put pressure on him he's going to go deep down not even close intended for Demaryius Thomas and he was covered by Mitchell and it's fourth down so already on third down again that's been the Bugaboo all season long for these guys Denver is one out of four throw that name right there in your memory bank Terrence Mitchell in the last couple of weeks has stepped in there for Phillip Gaines and just done a tremendous job if he keeps playing the way that he is this defense is different with him in there Riley Dixon crowd can't wait now they see Hills sitting back at the 15 there's the back bounced into the end zone for a touchback this stuff gets me excited now anytime you're talking about a great receiving tight end I told you in the opening great boobs here you see a little bit of that but what has made the difference here in the first half he's blocking watch what Kelsey is doing here he is cut off von Miller there on that key run here he is on the outside going to get the edge allow Alex Smith to go in for the touchdown and then I'm the long touchdown takes care of business on the outside against Darian Stewart and gets Tyreke ill in the end zone so far Travis Kelce was upset last week he's come back and said I'm ready to play this week he could be the best tight end of the league apart from anybody named Gronkowski in the conversation too so the defense here is able to do its job is Von Miller 62 charcandrick west his first carry of the night second and 12 yeah so you go a little nontraditional now and you start bringing von Miller inside he is the most exciting player on their defense to some extent you want to play a disciplined defense over there but when you got a guy like that now sometimes you got to say bond go get us one you know we need a momentum breaker here go get us something that he does on first down they need a three stop is what they need we're gonna have to go the quarter the 21yard line goes west gain of three its third down and nine for Casey yeah and there's Derek Wolfe over there making a play let's give him a little credit coming off a neck injury was sick with the flu all week a lot of people thought he wouldn't play now he's out here in this pouring rain storm trying to keep it together but he is their best run defender of those interior three the third and long perhaps he's filling the game and they love that he's in the slot to the right side tight formation here King Smith gets energy it's picked up by Justin Simmons and down the sideline he goes and that's exactly what the Broncos needed here Lori Nelson put the pressure on that for Smith to throw short the ball is picked off and run all the way back deep into Kansas City territory like Pittsburgh you just got to create a little chaos here there's Cory Nelson gonna loop around that way they'll cross inside and he just comes completely free even at 2.5 seconds all Alex Smith did there was catch it and throw it and it wasn't enough tremendous play by the young rookie on the back end who has a bright future this Justin Simmons rookie out of Boston College he was a third round draft choice so now can Denver cash in on a first down the goal it was a 38 yard interception return Justin Forsett is the back they fake it to him Simeon slides throws caught Demaryius Thomas Nabby birthday Christmas baby Demaryius Thomas number 29 for my believe today excellent player and there's Alec Smith you know they jumped out to what that 14nothing lead a week ago and then it's sort of crumbled underneath them and for Denver they're hoping that's the beginning of it again yep love to see history repeat extra lineman in here ference is the fullback is that so four set gets into the end zone but but 4% celebrating let's see if it's premature or not not for cheer Tony correctiy will tell us offside defense number 55 this penalty has been declined and the results of the play is a touchdown so the interception a first and goal and then into the end zone they go to to have the lead just so hard for these offensive lineman Michael Scofield to get around the edge this time Scofield does a great job and just drives Outram eke wilson for the easy touchdown nicely done up front and that quiets this as usual capacity throng at Arrowhead Stadium as Brandon McManus it's ready to kick the point after if these days is a llama drama with any point effort especially in what conditions we're fixin to put it down bangs it through so it's 14 to 7 Kansas City and we'll be back in 30 seconds so partner you thought your fantasy season was over I did no it's not I'm gonna sign up free you could want to trip to Super Bowl 50 you're gonna be there anyway absolutely we both will and Minnesota next year joined today in the Volcom playoff challenge you know it's never too late never you know who actually did beat me last night in the playoffs my fantasy leagues know who Warren Sapp he didn't just beat me there was not good what's wrong surprise never mind when with the IRS listening yeah I knew LAN the wet ball falling for the ball and off the tee it was supposed to really be extremely windy there was a front that came through is coming through whatever this line included thunderstorms it was almost like Kansas City was getting kind of weather you get in April on Christmas Day temperature in the mid 60's today tstorms predicted haven't happened in the yet obviously the off and on rain bring in the Bradley Roby to with the crime just anticipating old number 10 winding up with the football under any circumstance and right now Hill is areas standing back at the goal line but amazing as it is the games we've seen yeah there he goes from the one coverage that time that's as good as it gets for that Dakotah Watson as the guy who bottles among the great the one and only Wade Phillips through the years so much fun with this guy and you take a look at since 2015 he took over that's not bad your first in every category now and he makes outside linebackers great I still think to some extent DeMarcus Ware came here because of weight he just you know he was with him in Dallas and he made him into one of the great pass rushers and he knew what he does for outside line Spencer here you forget that the room in between the Dan Reeves era and the mike shanahan era wage bonus was the head coach for two years of the Denver Broncos yeah he is and you know he couldn't find a job for a little while remember that one here he sat out and I think he was in disbelief that nobody wanted him to be the coordinator so when he did come back in and get a job he did so with a little chip on his shoulder son of a bum second down and six from the 20yard line to the outside of the bubble screen Chelsea is off go see down the sidelines Kelsey has blocking to lean tries to catch from behind they can't touchdown Kansas City eighty yards off he goes Kelsey for the touchdown already four catches tonight over a hundred yards he has all four Kansas City receptions in the game let's give a little tip of the cap to tackle Mitchell Swartz look at the ability to get out around von Miller and make that key block is this really the Kansas City Chiefs I mean they're making big plays left and right here behind their star players is this really the Denver defense second in the league coming in Kansas City has 243 yards in a little over 14 minutes that's a thousandyard pace they'll get there the 243 already extra point is good they answer the touchdown by Denver with one of their own 21 7 back in a half a minute Feliz Navidad Andy Reid completing his fourth season at the helm here 14 years and Philadelphia a lot of people thought he was just taking year off rest or whatever he said no way couldn't wait to get back into coaching had to be the right situation dumps to Kansas City solid steady ownership the hunt family has owned this team since its inception as the Dallas Texans in 1960 and Andy has taken the team to the playoffs they've already clinched the spot this year and as I mentioned at the top this team hasn't been to the playoffs in backtoback seasons in 21 years as you look at the president of the team Clark Hunt pretty good bloodlines and that family huh boy I'll say I don't think there is an American Football League they can't city chiefs and ii against the AFC West in the four years since he has been here against the division seven and one against the Raiders five and two against the Chargers the two and five against the Broncos the Broncos have actually won five consecutive games in this stadium today what he's going to love tonight are the details these blocks my offensive lineman tight ends and wide receivers down the field have been absolutely perfect just that prior play alone was run to perfection from the 25 and wrapped up in sack d for number 55 twirling around and pinning out the difference is tonight the Kansas City Chiefs corners are planned the way the Denver Broncos corners have played all season long Terrence Mitchell on the outside is making a difference over there and when the quarterback simply does not have anybody open eventually that pass Russians going to get there that was a coverage sack illegal contact defense number 34 a fiveyard penalty don't there is no 34 let me be Mitchell 39 yes you know why we don't want to shortchange Clark Hunt he is the chairman at 34 seconds 34 seconds not the pressure make it if I know Clark he won't he doesn't kill he's happy with the scoreboard right now it is Mitchell so that is the cool yeah that was the contact on the double move it's always the hard thing the only real thing you can say about Terrence Mitchell so far a few penalties along the way but the coverage good the coverage is good enough he doesn't need that first time from the 29 yard line dump off to liquor and he gets taken down if we're short game by the cornerback number 20 Steve Nelson and that is going to take us into the second stanza late one quarter in Kansas City where the Chiefs lead the Broncos 21 the 7:00 and Sunday Night Football assumes after these messages nothing country club plaza here in Cannes city great shops straight restaurants that area coverage being brought to you by Geico Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth so the voya season's greetings to you all on this christmas paint twotouchdown lead for Kansas City and we start here with a second down and seven with semi fireman theses tied in after the 40 and up for a first down so updating the AFC playoff picture New England first round by Oakland in the playoffs but to be determined exactly what's going to happen we'll explain in a second Pittsburgh won today they clinched the North Houston has clinched the south at the moment Casey and Miami would be the wildcard teams Denver is still alive but just barely and barely ER after the first corner of this game 243 yards for Kansas City's offense now for fleaflicker here but the backs all stay back that is almost intercepted look way downfield the whoever went deep was well covered Jordans tailor was the intended receiver Simeon had to throw shorter than longer incomplete watch these defensive backs they weren't fooled at all they're backing up me when they see Ron keep going once they saw Emmanuel Sanders coming down the field they said we're not running up to try and play this our guys are doing pretty well against the run anyway go up and make a play Terrence Mitchell second down and Simmons is five of his first 14 was set gain of one sofa Denver to get in what they would have to do is win tonight go home and beat Oakland next week New England would have to beat Miami and Kansas City would have to go to San Diego and beat them and right now their first order of business is overcoming a 217 deficit there is John Elway so you're looking at the reigning champions who might be out and of course the other champion of the other conference Carolina is already out city is chased out flag is thrown pass will be caught at the 50 yard line by Sanders but when the referee throws the flag you know it at home the amount store the umpire in this particular case and this is what it normally announcer well maybe holding up in the 79 Michael Scofield that was Tom Bosley sort of making his break coming through right there and there's the hold on Michael Scofield they are going to play Billy Turner some in there number 70 at that guard position because they are obviously concerned about what happened to him last time when Chris Jones got the better of Scofield so instead of what would have been a first nine you got a third and have to get to the 50yard line to convert dump off into traffic in this Court Devante Booker but he's 9 yards shy of the first down stop there by PO talk about Denver's problems this year mainly third down and read zone and that is the case at least occurred that tonight one out of five yeah I really like that guy Tyreke he'll but I also really like what I'm seeing out of the defensive backs of the Kansas City Chiefs if they upgrade remember it was Philip Gaines who really took the brunt of a lot of those deep balls he's not in Terrence Mitchell in this is a much better secondary tonight than we saw that night the gauge was torched mainly by traders in Denver is a wobbly kick but it goes through the sideline was a good place to put it when you got Hill back there and it bounced out of bounds at about the 20 and we check in with Michelle Wow al it is the giving season and Von Miller gifted every player in the AFC West with custom bottles of wine and a current reading appreciate those who have helped you get this far and start working toward your next child to a dream thank you for helping to make our grant game great now Alex Smith told us he thought the girls was pretty cool saying I can't get enough flex from him that I could use a bottle well do you think he had a wine taster that's good for getting a bottle of wine from Von Miller and I'm playing for the other team on game wait let me think about over here tramp from the 20yard line Smith starts from the gun and the pass is caught for non yard game by Travis Kelce so Smith has completed five passes tonight and Kelsey again here with another catch on the outside Eric Fisher is just trying to hang on sometimes against DeMarcus Ware and that's what you have to do because you have a quarterback that's going to get the ball out of his hands quickly it's ok with that kind of a block and now the other thing you've got to say is TJ Ward not being in here tonight is making a difference they are wearing him out with Travis Kelce Ward among other things would not only cover it with leaves the team but a lot in taxes thanks throws clock first on and a lot more down the sideline with Spencer where's about the 49yard line now that's one of the better ten yards roads I've seen in a while DeMarcus Ware smells this one out the entire way and he is going to turn and just peel back here and you go okay there's nowhere to throw the ball but Alex Smith just sort of throws the lollypop over the top and comes up with a big play nicely done that time by Alex fest first pass thought by somebody not named Kelsey you tonight and he steps right out about that spot so they put it into 49 first down spencer's we're going through the middle so for years we had Jamaal Charles as your primary running back and he'd been injured and he was hurt this year and he came back they played three games so they had to find somebody else to carry the load it turns out to be the third year guy who is signed as a free agent and of LSU and he's done a nice job he's closing in as we mentioned before he'll be close to a thousand yards this season high school quarterback and a good one ran a lot of option can throw the football and sort of became a man as he put it run on the Penan LSU had learned that running back position as 895 yards that pass is caught and taken out of balance is that Paris and they're gonna rule it to completion and then have a bounds as you lost it with a fumble outbound it's a good play here by Todd Davis to punch this thing out let's see did he have control I have it tucked away in I think you've got to say he was turning the corner mmhmm although I'm never quite sure these days no never quite sure not gonna fight it challengeable if Kubiak wanted to go in that direction but he doesn't and it started down at two from the 43yard line the middle that bashes caught when he goes right back to demetrius harris loopy the number two tie then first down Kansas City thirdyear guy of wisconsinmilwaukee anytime you rush five guys what does that mean now it means mantoman coverage they're spread out Alex Smith is just going to catch it and throw it to the first guy that he sees open so now what does that do to weight Phillips and makes you more inclined to not bring pressure right and leave some people in the middle maybe to pick up those crossing routes that can be a frustrating style of offense especially when you're playing against the team with the lead nine and a half minutes left in the half the positive any flag is differential grounding quarterback was outside the pocket right pick up the flag it'll be second down you know what's interesting is that Alex Smith he was one of the best running quarterbacks in all of football this 5yard penalty or result I'm not I got it first down and you know the penalty was we're holding on Todd Davis first down let's take a look at this here's Davis right here and if he's gonna hold Travis Kelce I say okay okay I say okay it's a good idea nobody's been able to cover him so that's one way to take him out there they really missed the coverage ability of Brandon Marshall Todd Davis excellent against the run Corey Nelson excellent against the pass Brandon Marshall excellent against bollard Marshall North Ward they're obviously key guys and spinning throws and that's his first really errant throw of the night sniffles where he's completed eight of ten 148 yards to this point yeah and the one thing about Spencer we're we're nerds Brandon Marshall over there on the outside and dealing with that injury of his the hamstring and would love to have him back in there of course that was any Trevathan no longer there Brandon Marshall they were such great partners on the inside but when you win a World Championship we've seen it before right you get paid by somebody and sometimes they break up the band second and ten that passes incomplete intended for Tyree still dues will always draw a crowd it'll be third and ten Hill had that hat trick that night in Denver in the Sunday night game where he scored on a kickoff return following the free kick a run and a reception apart from that he didn't do much turns out that three by one set but too tight in oneonone to the top of the screen Travis Kelce 22 yard line Chris Connolly it's his first grab of the night he needs some time to get off and it's gonna be fourth down and four so the Kansas City field goal unit will come in now you just look over there Trevor Simeon Gary Kubiak and you go where's it gonna come from and you know then I think you start to say who it was going to come from somewhere else next year right so they've got all these options Paxton Lynch comes in as the rookie Trevor Simeon he's been pretty good but John Elway usually isn't into pretty good anything though absolutely not was it Brock Osweiler out the door would he's not on the bench here Santos Marie 39yard goal attempt what is no good wide to the left so never gets it back trailing by 14 a tan hand to go in the head Sunday Night Football being brought to you by GE we imagine a better world then make it real by Macy's by the 2017 Kia Sorento more Akina calm and by Budweiser this Bud's for you and Merry Christmas for the men the women of art to go around the country Criss crosses back and forth the four months they are spectacular a fun time to be away from their families on Christmas Day in fly season's greetings from our COO to everybody at home seven throws caught that's a first down yardline is sweet heuerman the tight ends or grab for him tonight first down we go back to the four weeks ago Chris yeah and the first meeting it was all sort of passing to the left side look at those quarterback ratings over there nine yards and less over a hundred ten to nineteen and a hundred and nine deep down the field even better a perfect quarterback rating and so far tonight it has been Steven Nelson over here on regular down in business number 20 he's done a great job on Emmanuel Sanders tonight and then when they get into the nickel situations Terrence Mitchell has been that third ace in the hole from the 45 now play action by sometime sets of a screen Booker is able to escape a tackle in the backfield and take the ball to the Kansas City 34 yard line xavante hooker burst out halfway through the quarter 21yard gain watch Matt Parra does the sinner just stay on his guy he is one of the more athletic centers in football that is such a hard walk to make and he is ten yards down the field still maintaining contact and the Denver Broncos needed that play right there Paradis barely practices anymore he's got such bad hips when he comes out in the game one of the absolute best book for the third leading receiver back to the two stud wide outs Semyon throws for one of those sons but he's double covered that's Emmanuel Sanders and delete the Swart put the pressure on that time before the throw at second down to ten you know you have seen I think a little bit of an evolution in the way that Marcus Peters plays you know he's one of those big rest acres it gets a lot of interception but I've also seen a little more patience out of him now he gave up a lot of big plays he made a lot of big plays but there is the ace on this defensive back yard he's the one most teams try to avoid namely the Pro Bowl his first two seasons in the NFL it's almost picked off Ron Parker the safety where this beautifully was put to hold on sir down at 10 on Parker with a spectacular interception a week ago and he read the eyes all the way watch him jump right in front and almost had that one from Demaryius Thomas got a hand on it is this an aggressive defensive back deal right now we haven't talked about Eric Berry and here's a guy that probably in the conversation for Defensive Player of the Year and about as good a Christmas story two years ago he's fighting lymphoma and I was going to the Pro Bowl third and 10 sitting and complete firemen the tight end he was covered on the outside by Sorenson goes forth and 10 now I'm no coach but I'm just gonna give you my opinion to this okay I think that Denver and Gary Kubiak he stays with the run better than anybody can still stay with the run this game is within reach and because of some of the mixing and matching they're doing at the linebacker position it's not a game that you have to go drop back with a young quarterback like Trevor Simeon already well its fourth and ten he's come out for a 52yard field goal attempt course the downside is if he misses it Casey gets the ball near midfield but McManus one of the best in the league bangs it through from 52 sir need to go in the head 21 to 10 chiefs but like Sunday the National Hockey League has been around for a hundred years these Ateneo classic coming up and that the Winter Classic next Monday the second it's a Blackhawks at the Blues meeting outdoors and push the Louis Pospisil Z they're hosting it my tempura can the gang to comb it Chicago and st. Louis tux back here Kansas City will take it to the 25 so look at Hill this season six receiving touchdowns three rushing touchdowns including one tonight one hunt return one kickoff return that came in the evening in Denver and that's pretty good company Bobby Mitchell back in 58 with skins Neal Sears at 65 the other rookies to accomplish that in a single season anytime you're on a panel with guys like that you know you've done something pretty special you know and they clocked him earlier this year going 22 miles an hour that's pretty remarkable because it that's Kayvon Webster the image and Mitchell who went to the Redskins eventually he was with the Browns at that particular point and Wolff going back to the locker room back after this where's the site that we always hate to see that's Kayvon Webster OU's then the special teams maven for the Denver Broncos who took a shot here here's what happened you know and you're gonna get the hit right there on linebacker Terrence Smith and Webster just never saw it coming and if you've ever chased kicks before you understand that the one you never see is the most frightening and they're some of his mates over there and yep back to KC in 30 seconds well that's a much happier site before me what the commercial is they were to take him off on the carnage we were able to set him up and now stand them up main level them right there I'm sure very concerned about the condition of one Kayvon Webster so Morocco is a war of attrition Ward and Marshall were already out we saw wolf going back to the locker room Webster a defensive back but really earns his money on special teams and at least they're able to sit him up and ride them back to the locker room you're right never saw it coming right Chris I mean it's just now those things what happens yeah it day you know and it's just saying defensive Terrence Smith you're sort of trained to line them up down the middle because they make moves and you've got to start down the middle and if the guy never sees you sometimes you get those kinds of shots and I'm sure that Terrence Smith probably feels worse than anybody out here but this Kansas City crowd they're great football fans they cheered the minute that you set him up a little bit when he stood up and they get it yep they get it so we'll check on the condition Rachelle sure we'll have an update for us on a wolf n on Webster shortly and with 6:38 begins to rain again it's been raining off and on front moving through but it hasn't been nearly as windy as they had predicted 21 to 10 Kansas City and they shot from the 25yard line and to give it to Hill spinning and darting picks up five yards of your 30yard line taken down by the outside linebacker Shane ray same exact play that they scored on earlier Zyra kill going to get all the way in the hole but this time it was Chris Harris who came up and basically took out the tight in Travis Kelce and didn't allow that one to get out around the edge in the same way Hill has run for a hundred yards tonight of course he gets 70 on the one Rock the Kansas City already 300 yards the total offense and stay at 3:02 right now as Travis Kelce make the catch von Miller put the pressure on backtoback games now only rookies with 60 yard or more TD runs and consecutive games you go to Lenny more the great old Baltimore Colt he did it back in 1956 I was talking to offensive coordinator Brad Childress and I said it just seems like you guys could get the ball to take a little bit more he said Chris trust me in this game you're gonna see him with the ball in his hands all don't worry about it 35 growers can solicit the first so I was just thinking Chris you know the last time that the Denver Broncos gave up more than 300 yards in a hand I mean this is the number two defense in the league I have been told by a little birdie 1981 they were playing the Bengals of course you scored a touchdown relish yes you didn't like that graphic a lot better so I brought it up little goes Spencer we're in the 41 and one of the guys that I think has really played so much better this season is Shane ray comes in with seven sacks on the season and Mike Von Miller he's a guy watch him just kind of work his way through this traffic over here but I'm sure working alongside von Miller and DeMarcus Ware some of these great outside linebackers has really helped his game really made a difference in last few weeks the outside fake it there give a dispenser where that sets on the third down and short I tell you the other storyline that we have to talk about a little bit in this game out is the play of these offensive linemen I mean it really was the pressure and the sacks on Alex Smith in that first game that made such a huge difference in this one and so far Eric Fisher and Mitchell Schwartz and little help from the tight ends out there they have done a pretty good job Alex Smith getting the ball out of his hands that been kept Smith clean came in twenty third of the league in rushing but you'd never know it after tonight we're to the outside around so what would be a first up will come back which is going to be an offensive holding coal holding offense number 75 10yard penalty and repeat first down it's John Reed who they had brought in as a sixth lineman on that play the extra offensive lineman is gonna try and get it out here and get his hands on bond Miller unfortunately he did get his hands on bond Miller pretty easy one to call they've got Sylvester Williams who is the injured Bronco as we said do you Ward and Marshall and Wolfe no Webster already at know Malik Jackson of course and free agency and you know this was a pretty stout run defense a season ago and you take some of those guys out of the mix Malik Jackson and Derrick wolf together were tremendous and of course sylvester williams and then you lose one of your linebackers a free agency and then brandon marshall ends up hurting his hamstring so you're at that war of attrition time of year or a lot of times it's how many healthy bodies you have left so odd numbers with his Denver defense this year the second in the league overall fourth and allowing points that's really good first against the pass that's terrific with 20 language against the Rose let's go to a show well the news on Kayvon Webster is that he was taken back to the locker room and walked into the locker room under his own power he is in the concussion protocol Derek Wolfe we saw go back as well he is back there questionable with that neck injury that's been bothering him out I thank you Michelle mixing and matching and bringing in second line guys all over the place safety look here on third and 11 Smith under pressure grows and wrapped up to leave is able to take care of trucks and requests and that'll make it fourth down so cold foot comes in to punt this will be the first Chiefs punt of the night Denver's already punted four times and Denver will conserve some of the clock here since they'll get the ball back as they take their first timeout so it's been announced that in the Flex worlds that we live in we have Green Bay and the choice on Sunday Night Football and that will wrap up the entire season and what a way to do it no matter what happens to the Lions tomorrow night in their beam with the Cowboys the winner of that game next Sunday night will win the NFC North and of course that would be a home game loser could be out but the Lions and the Packers in a beauty next Sunday night from Motown from the 17 yard line making the fair catch there is Khalif Raymond with 321 white beard red hat red jacket and he's addicted to cookies Hudson and even not here nice this year nice getting presents for Christmas this year I want the Chiefs to make the playoffs of course I talked about those bloodlines he got it because the Christmas present was delivered today would Pittsburgh be Boulevard the Chiefs got into the playoffs Christmas present the pass is knocked down at the line of scrimmage it'll be second down and ten foe got his hands on it there we go big 'don't re PO right there who long as his back is feeling okay he usually can get a little pressure in that pass rush as well one and a half sacks on the year but seven hits on quarterbacks this season which is the most on Kansas City so you don't always expect your nose tackle be able to get that kind of pressure sent me an is8 421 which this one Thomas and Thomas finally gets into the game 27 yard line in the manner of the least winding up on the board here Thomas is caught only two tonight for 15 yards and that's how good the corner play has been on the outside you have to 1,000 yard receivers on either side and they have not been involved in the story really whatsoever Demaryius Thomas over a thousand Emmanuel Sanders over a thousand pretty tough pretty key second quarter third down coming up here whose if they stop him get the ball back with a ton of time to have to go third and one hookers gets wrapped up for about a threeyard loss the floors is right there in that case he can think about taking their time out the ports too fast for this he's going to leave them unlocked he is going to catch this play you know it's one of those things you're always tempted if you can leave that far side unblocked you can add an extra blocker but then you take that lateral jump step Devante Booker and no way Hill backs up escapes for the moment then it's taken out of bounds this 26 yard line that takes us to the twominute warning and that's Hill Blue is slow and getting back up on the other hand fallacy let's meet the Ravens the final seconds to win the AFC North Packers Lions in the NFC North title game next Sunday night complete AFC and NFC oil pictures coming up a dance on Steve Ortolan skin Travis's vampire I should just take him with us on the road why not maybe Detroit that's it we go 149 clock stopped in 11 seconds after the twominute warning after the punt return this is Wes taking it up to the oneyard line case he has all of its timeouts so no need to necessarily hurry at this particular point is he look to pick up the first down Sylvester Williams you saw him come off one much ago he is back in the game oh it's almost picked up by Roby Macklin studying inside Roby went to the outside and that would have been a big thick third down and eight he's had a pig six this year and Roby was all over this when Macklin coming off of his best game of the year as far as yardage is concerned and that would have been an interesting way to go into the locker room right there 21 17 I'm all for spreading it around but when you get somebody who is as hot as Travis Kelce is in this game and time to kill c64 123 over a thousand yards this year the rope is at two interceptions and built with mix hitches and both will run back 51 yards you know the hard can't even stop this Tonie currently will tell us is it a false start or unabated to the quarterback little smile from Tony offense number 11 one thing you cannot do is flinch your hands that is you've got to be very still as the quarterback and give Alex Smith a little credit there trying to pick up a cheap five yards but now basically what they've done is essentially if the Broncos can make a stop give them one more shot at the end zone and it's a third down and 13 which is not their Forte Denver has stopped them they can take the time for them Miller makes the tackle Denver takes a timeout important drive coming up because Kansas City is going to get the ball to start the second half will bag von Miller guys that are great pass rushers that also play the run that's the reason in my opinion those two guys Aaron Donald are kind of the top candidates for Defensive Player of the Year this year police ramon's it drops back to receive this punt from Colquitt this guy may be the fastest guy on the Denver Broncos team so as it started to rain a little bit again here there is a little magic to be had out of the Broncos special teams and may well be Khalif Raymond well Jordan Norwood has been their main guy but he said fumbling issues so they go with his run back six one this year we'll skip out of bounds inside the 35 yard line there's the manual Sanders who destroyed the Kansas City Chiefs the first time around tonight they've got number 20 Steven Nelson on him and he's done a tremendous job and any time Sanders goes down the field they've got it at least four eyeballs on them maybe a little tug a little Huck as they go along and your Sanders didn't like it much but for Steven Nelson a job well done here in this first half no catches they've only God knew him twice we're said in the backfield with Simeon straight shot avoids the sack the traffic laws the flag is down the first time flag down on the offensive backfield Wow rocking the pass huh defense number 95 with a forearm well after the play was over this 15yard penalty will be added to the end of the play and an automatic first down that's Chris Jones and that is big it takes it from the 50 down to the 35 there he is right there and you're gonna see it's a nobrainer nice job by Russell oh Coon out there and then the shot after it's all said and done maybe in college I don't even think in college get away with that one well it doesn't feel like Kansas City has so dominated this game and if they could come away with points here basically one score game going in at that 328 yards to Denver's 134 so that's totally tilted Kansas City's way Bedford has one time at 63 seconds Samiha but you've gotta whistle before to play Mozart offense number 71 fiveyard penalty remains first down and that's Donald Stevenson yeah and it's tough on those offensive linemen any time the outside pass rusher then he's keeping his eye on in that case D fort flinched does it cross the line of scrimmage as an offensive lineman you know you've got to get out there to have any chance against d4 they're helping him a little bit tonight by leaving the tight end over on that side to put those three more seconds back on the clock as there was no place you back to 104 first and 15 of course the ground gets really raucous in these situations it's coming fast in the traffic and Thomas couldn't handle it the flag is thrown it was almost picked off get Annie reception a near interception and a penalty today an interesting call very hesitation and go and look like Terrence Mitchell kind of tripped over to Marius Thomas take a look at this on the outside Mitchell's following and there was justice both teams it will offset holding he finished number 21 illegal formation offense number 71 by rule these penalties will offset and replay first down but Stevenson was backtoback penalties a false start and part of an illegal formation well the other thing you do when you're facing a great pass rushers get another yard off the ball in this officiating through raining went picking up a little bit temperature is 51 burst and 15 sylveon's sliding and gets it away barely these floors coming around the end number 55 puts the pressure on will be second down and 15 for Denver yeah this has been a rough go here when you have to try and handle deep board on the outside and basically that breaks down what you want to do as far as the fundamental is you kind of turn and run to try and catch up to them swing D Ford and Chris Jones on the outside tough night for these tackles and now they just need to try and get it back in field goal range that they're two wideouts Sanders and Thomas both sent to the left they go 5 wide blitz hit me to the right side that's the five Betty Fowler makes his first grab of the night Kenneth actor makes the tackle clock continues to roll its third down intense they stay spread which means completely on Trevor Simeon to catch it and throw it not much time now thirty at Kansas City takes a time at the city their first so Denver still has one you have a half minute and right now would you be in field goal range yet for McManus yep 53 yards and there he is warming up and they're looking for seven not three yeah and you've got DB's everywhere here so basically they're going to be able to cover that up and I just wonder if Andy Reid was thinking okay they're probably going to want to make one play here again to get it in field goal range and just remind his guys this isn't all about defending the end zone let's defend and make this another 53 yard kick here enough to beat the dead horse was talking about third down has been a big problem all year they're 107 tonight 31 from the 35yard line the lake woods simian going that one outofbounds belief Raymond speedy would that missiles covering him and now you got a fourth down and 10 do they bring McManus in here yeah the reason they called the timeout I think pops unwanted to set this up he's bringing pressure from all over this left side here the tribes worst ever Semyon to get the ball out of his hand quickly and set up that long field goal attempt did not want to give up the short quick one to make this field goal easier this will be a 53yard attempt he made one right down the middle from 52 he has the leg negative fake now you got McManus ringing to the outside can he pick up the first down back into the 29yard line but Eric worries those Denver can't even pick up the three you know likelihood that go into the locker room down by 11 Casey has the ball with 17 seconds left I think she's right here I could be wrong but that is Eric Murray who is the best of the special teams players this is a guy that has made play after play on special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs this year and I'll just say that Fred and McManus is not Tyree killed and he was not going to outrun Eric Murray who's been fantastic this year most of the Benny Hill thanks great spirit so Kansas City comes up they throw deep once well we've got the two timeouts about 17 seconds he goes as always at 4 seconds it's 13 seconds remaining in the half you know it's gonna be really interesting for the second half of this game now Andy Reid's sort of got criticized for maybe being a little conservative in the second half by his own guy Travis Kelce but this is the way the Chiefs play you know they get out they have a lead you know they hold on to it he doesn't lose all that often what is a 20 and for something like that over the past so many games and you know but so now they're gonna take a D here so we'll see how aggressive they are in the second half take a knee two and a half so they go to the locker room Kansas City jumped out to a quick 14 nothing late it's 21 to 10 as we come to the header these messages from your Indies tonight's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by Chevrolet merry Christmas from Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City Smith's gonna keep it himself around the outside he goes for the touchdown Tyreke hill down the sideline can they catch him no they can LC is off touchdown Kansas City generally the most awarded car company two years in a row CERN in the third quarter half time it's twenty one to ten Kansas City and they will get the ball as we start the second half Alex Smith 168 yards a TV and one pick entire retail had those four calories for a hundred and two yards and Kelsey his sixteenth with 100 or more receiving yards which sits an NFL record by a tie then in a season than that Bronco defense and not allowed three hundred more yards in the first half since 1981 Kelsey tying a record so of a chance to establish it to buying himself next week when they go to San Diego been raining off the mound raining fairly hard right now as we start the second half McManus to kick off and the Anthony Thomas not Hill is back to receive down in the enso case she passes it to 25 and we go to Michelle all right al well gary kubiak told me at halftime that that was as bad a half of football as his defense has played all season and said but we're only down 11 we just got his keep playing aggressively meanwhile they'll be without defensive end Arif wolf who is out with that neck injury as for Andy Reid he was really unhappy about the penalties despite bleeding he said too many penalties took us out of field position that we wanted he wants to seem to stay disciplined here in the second half al all right Thank You Sean he knows all too well they had that 14nothing lead last week and wound up losing the game they don't want to repeat that tonight obviously as they take over at the 25yard lines but Kelsey up to the left and Spencer we're in the backfield well running the play clock is down to lon as they spot for a sixyard game by the number two tight end demetria's Parrish Hill took a shot on his knee on the last punt return well he was shaken up and maybe that's the reason he is not answer we'll parks came in there and put his helmet right on that right knee and there he is or on the sideline you know I always think about Marcel's and Dave Megan you know he was you want to give him to a ball every single time but you want to make sure he makes it to the playoffs right for sure this is where they've chucked his way to a first down here the fans want to see those guys like make it was and Mike Hill is they want to see them in on every plate yeah and with good reason so to win either exciting to watch but it's also a good thing if you can go back in there and establish a run and pound it a little bit then you get some of those flashy plays joined the outside again that time nice job inside by the wrong Dubonnet 30 the 35 first down spit that short drive we'll get taken down by Shaq Barrett in some we talked about Alex Smith in that quick passing game you'll see it here right around two seconds even faster than what he's been averaging this season and what does that do for you as an offensive tackle Eric Fisher in this case allows you to be more aggressive see him jump out there and get on them same thing with Mitchell Schwartz on the other side you know has hit him once and Alex Smith is going to get it out as long as you don't cleanly miss you're gonna see Alex Smith get the football out of his hands he was sacked six times by the Broncos in that game a month ago they read that perfectly do the broncos wanna put the pressure on that Chris Harris was right there to take care of the receiver Macklin it'll be third down and ten that was a shot right there watch pond Miller coming right off the edge over here on this side and when your food leggings you are pregame there are different rules that apply as you're coming out there and you saw bond Miller just drop Alex Smith you'll remember that one snap that head back and course he had some issues with sons of concussions earlier this year mr. stark intoxicated that Hill number 10 he's back in the game on the third down and 10 Macklin but as well short of the first down so good start for the Denver defense I'll tell you the other thing I remember Alex Smith saying is that I went back and I watched the film and only had one target Travis Kelce in the second half and he said after watching the film he was open a lot more than that I have to be trained myself to force the ball in there sometimes because he's so good those who those six catches for 123 Cole quits kick the ounces at the 22 and it keeps on rolling and then it's covered up at the 8yard while is it is it you got Raymond who comes up with it Raymond came up he couldn't make the cats any lettuce sounds that he wanted to make sure at least he stopped it from rolling another five or six yards recover to their self this is my husband Cory Nelson and our daughter Phoenix Austin we would just like to wish you a happy holidays from our family tears and a Merry Christmas hi i'm jordan norwood from the denver broncos and this is my beautiful wife alia and my daughter Frannie and from my family to yours would like to say happy holidays we're happy to you this part of your Christmas with Isis we bring in the desert the last of two games the first one was a beauty today in Pittsburgh not a beauty of here a Baltimore Ravens fans Steelers won a thriller to clinch the AFC North eliminate the Ravens from oils at stake is the which on seven yard line traffic and it's incomplete head before Devante booker again if you picked us up late just the playoff situation here Kansas City got into the playoffs when pittsburgh won they still have a chance to win the division as they win tonight's win in San Diego next week and Oakland loses to Denver that would get Casey the title Denver needs to win tonight he to win next Sunday against Oakland BYOB the lose could rule England the Kansas City competes San Diego and they would get it after he left nut the hooker history yard gaze back of a play right here by Remy Wilson we talked about Derek Johnson being out of the game but anytime you can come up and go through an offensive lineman like Michael Scofield and still make a hit like that pretty impressive and now the pressure really on Trevor Simeon to make plays out of his own end and this crowd is not going to make it easy Simmons 11 out of 2017 one parade on 3rd or the the sideline Emmanuel Sanders name time catch at a most opportune moment all the way out to the 36 yard line one of the few times they've actually gone just straight oneonone coverage down the field with anybody on Sanders that time Terrence Mitchell was close but nothing he holds on to the ball absolutely nice catch longest play of the night for the Broncos daily 26 from the 37 now on a peak to the outside pressure was on receiver was covered before put the heat on second down and 10 for so many years we've seen the athleticism on the outside just in Houston tom hollie and now it's d ford who is in a position here to make these kinds of plays you come out on the bootleg you're gonna have one quick look and then you're going to get number 55 staring you right in the eye but sometimes actually getting free the team there were 11 total sacks the last time they met in Denver flag is throw here tell me correctly to make the call let's say Eric Berry makes more plays around the field he just he's a blur and he actually changed positions used to be more of that box safety down playing Iran now he's back in center field and pick six outside defense lined up in the neutral zone Denver's accepted this fiveyard penalty and repeat second down yeah they had they taken the play it would have been third down and one now it's second and five Justin Houston missing him or so Derek Johnson ripping Achilles couple of weeks ago on a Thursday night Denver has its own issues with guys sidelined died before at during the game we should be staying with the run with this style of defense a false star here you see the movement along that offensive front is that Stevenson again used to play here well sir offense number 71 fiveyard penalty remains second down sure is it's tough you know the crowd gets going there he is right there he's used to this he's used to here in the crowd here but look he's on offense he played for the Chiefs came over as a free agent the offseason I would not be afraid to run some quarterback draws go empty formation they're spreading everybody out in for coverage with two deep safeties it's the perfect opportunity if you're willing to run second 10 set up a screen she's just sniffing that out perfectly Rakeem Nunez Rochas was right there to stop him that's a loss of four and makes it third down and 14 for Kubiak next call here yeah and you're kind of playing into their hands they've got Daniel Sorensen in there at the linebacker position a safety and when you throw any kind of pass he was the one that got there first and set it up for Nunez roaches but now what looked like it was going to be very short yardage that's their whole third down story tonight if they keep winding up a third and long third and 14 here Simeon survey has that one batted at the line of scrimmage they will tuck rule that's not a tuck rule any more formally known as tried to hold on to it probably a good thing that he did I think he was trying to squeeze it into double coverage right down the middle and said but at least they got it off their own goal line back there flip the field but here we go again punting at the number 10 reception by Sanders negative back there feels at the 16 on the outside not really nice coverage job by dent borough 8:23 left in the third KC by 11 it is awards the season that means Jimmy Fallon will spring in action Golden Globe Awards just hit Sunday January the 8th live right here on the National Broadcasting Company Kansas City Missouri on this Sunday night Christmas light very very over on the bench Kansas City offense out on the field empty the backfield Newland motion run after the 43 you know coming into the game this is the guy who ran for almost 500 yards last season that one is good for twenty four he ran for a touchdown earlier he's run for 33 yards tonight longest run of the season for him but coming into the game he hadn't run for about 60 yards or so yeah if you think he looked fast he is fast he came out running about a 4/5 and I think those concussions earlier in the year sort of slowed him down a bit maybe running the football but he certainly is capable of making big plays like that a chance tonight he's up to a honey could the sun's out that's a nice tackle coming up to make the stop there is there ain't Stewart now they've changed how they're playing this a little bit on the back end now for the Denver Broncos instead of putting all the pressure on the end of the line of scrimmage they're bringing Darian Stewart up a little closer let him deal in the open field with Tyree Hill the hell was at 100 yards he loses one there he's back down to double figures in there it's Kelsey and away Franco territory the 41 yard line tackle there by Simmons he is a horse as keep taxing the horse of the ham now you ever seen a tight end accelerate like this watch at the moment this catches bei personal a great move but then the ability to run past the next safety I mean that's what you see wide receivers do in the open field but Kelsey has done that time after time here tonight boy he is serious about the idea he wants the ball in the second half 70 yards going to the other side in demetrius paris about sex for now there's the next step in the phase of that readoption so now you start to bring down to safety to play the outside so what do you end up doing now let's fake it fake the run and we'll do a little shovel pass there and get it back inside so one of those plays you see a lot in college not so much in the NFL because they don't like to run their quarterback as much but she was tough to defend 36 yard line and third down and three with five and a half to go in the third watch line Miller here make this tackle with this outside arm pretty amazing up there just his backside are mild up he grabbed a towel or what he did but that's a strong man good play by the perennial 12 owner Super Bowl MVP last year they heat a third and three and that's caught does he have the first down it looks like he will Kelsey making the catch a little slow in her rising but he picks up enough for a Kansas City first down you're trying to go man coverage you're trying to bring people engaged in it but what they've done here tonight with the fact that they've been able to play so well with Kelsey inside is they basically eliminated the two best players in the secondary I mean I can't remember talking about it keep to leave and Chris Harrison those two guys are ranked 1 as far as I'm concerned cornerback played this season and yet really they haven't even been talked about that great point nearly mentioned their names tonight when the city has 393 yards and that's incomplete looking for a flag crowd wants one don't get it Justin Simmons wrap it up Paris and it'll be second down to ten Smith sake come on look at the board nicely done by the young rookie Justin Simmons there he is just oneonone against the former basketball player good play there's no foul there nicely done Rocco's without TV award lost Kiba Westrick earlier second and ten fourman rush Pass is incomplete Spira dill was the intended receiver third down you've got Travis Kelce as a single receiver to the left side and you have three wide receivers to the other side and what do you think they're doing defensively they're Manning up on this side over here and they're playing all kinds of coverage back over to number 87 a tight end that's the kind of impact he's having on this game he's in the slide I saw him is Tyree kill nest is in the backfield snap that's a big one because that drives them out of field goal range temporarily well sir offense number 71 fiveyard penalty remains third down Mitchell Schwartz came over from the Cleveland Browns as a free agent something to shore up that right side third and 1506 left in the third keeps have led all the way more than that but it's him complete that Spira kill who got bracketed there some now that's surprised yeah you would think what you're looking for seven yards five yards whenever would be to make this instead of a 55 yard field goal and I'm gonna attempt the field goal to bring Dustin Colquitt in and they basically had Jeremy Maclin with 10 yards of space over there they could have raised up just thrown it to him would have had the five yards and kick in the field go instead of hunting here the currenty Pulsar offense number 42 five yard penalty remains fourth down it's Anthony Sherman look at all the room out here you just raise up throw the ball right out there to Jeremy Maclin you're gonna have at least a field goal opportunity but no went the other way not the worst penalty in the world gets cold with five more yards to work with but inside their territory fair catch is called for and made by Kali claimant at the 19yard line we weren't here for a game about two years ago Eric Paree had just been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma do you think in a shot in the chest in the game at Oakland went to the doctor with Foley of lymphoma of course that ended that season went down to Atlanta for treatment spent Christmas 2014 in a hospital and here is last year the comeback player of the year and here he is on Christmas night in 2016 and having a heck of a year he's going to the Pro Bowl again and story so many levels from the 14 yard line poor said as the running back on the start to the 20 and he was talking to us about it the other day how he found out about it how his mom and dad helped me through it he visited Children's Mercy Hospital you understand this week that he has given more than six thousand presents to the kids in this area nice Emma toy for Christmas he remembered what it was like on Christmas Eve to be getting chemotherapy me how lonely it was and he wanted all those kids to feel better second and four on top of it all that man simply thrown away is he his parents were there in Atlanta you got a flag down here at the 23yard line there he was before the game just reflecting in the rain the rest of the team had already left the field to go back to the locker room before they came back out again and there he was and you can only imagine what he was thinking at that moment I'm sure just reflecting on how lucky is to a be here and B being able to play football at the level that he is but it was it was really interesting to hear him talk about the Robin Roberts story having to get chemotherapy every two weeks he thought he was unlucky and you know sad about that and then he saw the Robin Roberts story had to get for ten consecutive days chemotherapy that was so painful left in tears for so long and it really helped him pick it over the home that last penalty decline in eligible men and that's incomplete and no flag intended for Cody Latimer covered by Derrick berry and he was saying he said the chemo would Depot up all night his mom was in the hospital with her most of the time she's up watching television that's when he saw the Robin Roberts toy at about three o'clock in the morning he also talked about how is the true meaning of Christmas sort of comes to him every single year he said having my mom and dad and friends in the hospital praying for me the 43 and he'll cannot escape the grasp of Benny Fowler taken down back at the 35 less than three to go in the third and 11point lead the Kansas City well the Premier League has gift that keeps on giving with a full day of coverage Premier League Boxing Day begins tomorrow morning at 7:30 Eastern on NBC they said football from the 38yard line sheets begin this drive handoff goes to Spencer where or something a football being brought to you by Southwest just to low fares with nothing to hide that's transparency cyber rise in it's always a great gift on Verizon by the new filter split in theaters January the 20th and by samsung hey turn your phone into a wallet rock the players hosting the Boys and Girls Club of Denver Chiefs Ontario Jeremy Maclin local high school seniors Eric Berry visiting Children's Mercy Hospital right there Tyreke he'll who will of course draw a crowd every time he touches the ball and that time is just in Simmons tackling them say what this guy is making some plays the night here right check this out sees the run going away probably had a little coverage responsibility trying to run that same play they scored the touchdown on and this time Justin Simmons you also have the interception earlier comes up and meets him in the backfield chief scores all of their points in the first quarter tonight up by 11 and 45 left in the third third down and nine Miller throwing his hands up thinks he was induced but didn't look like it from here vigils on his back Sonic's defense number 58 is unavailing the quarterback fiveyard penalty he named her down and that makes a third down and four and you could tell what they're trying to do there von Miller they were faking the blitz to the defensive right side and bringing von Miller and company to that side and he knows his third down and nine his sack time when he was hungry for that one has not been a second the game filet for a beauty makes the catch first down to the 40yard line oh stop went back over the middle again tackled by Simmons Kansas City first down a little over a minute to play of the quarter on a great protection on that one and here's Mitchell Schwartz on the outside going against Bonn Miller and it was charcandrick west stepping up that running back position as well fisher on the outside just good enough running by nicely done and I tell you Travis Kelce put about four moves on that time to work himself open that was beautiful started inside working so about a step in half to the outside came back over the middle to get him so free and you got a fan on the field so they'll chase him down one of the best tackles in the night because that's what's going to happen you'll run out of the field and that's what Kelsey did to get him so free too much eggnog not for Kelsey so that stops the clock and they're very well that was quite quite quite a tackle but you know all we do is just encourage nonsense like that sir let's go to Michelle well that gentleman will not be doing any dancing anytime soon but Travis Kelce has been doing it all night have you seen this he's having a career night receiving yards he told me was David bust out a new touchdown dance he had me sport since prek but he said look there's something Christmasy like sleigh bells or reindeer you can do about anything he would like tonight with 158 receiving yards six games 100 or more Tiger benefit record tight ends in a season easier to say my great importance wearing that defense down Todd Davis makes the tackle gain of five and that will take us down to either the end of the quarter were close to it you know the other thing the Chiefs have done a much better job of tonight is not getting into his third and long situations they did last time talking to Brad Childress he said we just played right into bond miller's hands and that will take us to the end of the third quarter see ford will play the Sunday night game for you and we will be back in Kansas City after these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by Geico Al Michaels first on Rose Michele Tafoya high above Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City oh look at this place this is the 45th season and they redid it a few years ago but is still great site it's almost like Lambeau Field in Green Bay with pretty much like a college type of atmosphere a very different kind of place but a terrific place to watch or in a football game second down and five as we start the fourth quarter first time you know Chris I'm thinking about they made the planes for this in nineteen sixty eight or nine opened in 72 you built the baseball's changing across the parking lot Kansas City was so ahead of its time all the other towns Cincinnati st. Louis Atlanta Pittsburgh Philadelphia built the soup tureens you played in one of them Riverfront Stadium based on football they've all been torn down down they on astroturf they got it right here is it pretty amazing they did do you think you've been in the baseball stadium or of the football stadium oh right blow its deadline a lot of baseball movies the the Royals were good who's here for the world stories in 1985 when they beat the st. Louis Cardinals never disputed play in the sixth game with George Orda a c17 11 to nothing nothing better than giving you a math problem you'll stay up all night second and 7 here I know one thing that's the day of the seventh game of that world series and when dick houses office before the game in across the parking lot the Rams are playing the Chiefs is that right it was a pretty good day and you didn't do that game second and seven from the 24 Smith is going to take off again for another big rung it's tied at the 11 yard line he's carried four times tonight for 46 yards and as those linebackers start jumping the underneath coverage in here it gives Alex Smith opportunities if this team is going to go on a championship run and they could you know this is a pretty goodlooking team out here there's Kelsey on the outside take the last piece of the puzzle is going to be Alex Smith running the football you're seeing some of that tonight whoa as she winds up with the bowl to the nine it's imperative really for Denver's to hold them to it worst a field goal here and keep it as a twopossession game starting to pull a few things out of the playbook and for Gary Kubiak no tight ends losses fullback they're sort of stuck in an offense now that it's really not what he wants to be right off the pace running back CJ Anderson pull back Andy Janice was doing a great job and look at her second down of seven jingle didn't complain fairness though to do with each other 37 he's a goodlooking player and this Demetrius Harris really has started to make some plays here coming up and making this cut this is a nice move and it couldn't have been an easier catch you know sometimes they say you let it into your body and I think and bounce off your shoulder pads in a way you can't believe not caught by Hill so they do hold into the field goal descendants Smith tonight is 20 to 30 know it's interesting Christy 14 passes have gone to tight ends 85 passes to wide outs tonight maybe this is why I mean this was kind of game over here right if they catch either one of those Falls it's a really tough spot now Denver at least still has hope 27 yard attempt for Cairo Santos who won the overtime game in Denver with the carom shot to the side pocket and it's still a twopossession game which can be extended by three cent a night before being brought to you by Toyota let's go places by tmobile switch to the network bill for unlimited data by passengers now playing in theaters and by US Bank there are boys and girls bill traveling circus for a gang right there send me the comment on how these folks do it amazing we love you Kelly Hayes with the binoculars in front of his face the one chance he has to be on national television what's the matter with you how abou Kelly hey sis because he lives in Aspen you know that right cagney toes Richie a tick under 12 minutes to play in the fourth quarter the Denver Broncos sinus stay alive they lose tonight they are out of the playoffs Carolina already out of the playoff so you're to Super Bowl teams of last season's we watching television in January sandals to kick off breezy the city recovered before those out of atoms is the question they do Raymond trying to get a little something extra instead disaster Anthony Sherman coming with the strip let's make sure nobody's out of bounds as they touch the ball they are not special teams they've come up big they make the play right before the end of the half make the play here complete effort tonight by the Kansas City Chiefs yeah there's special teams their defense Raymond can only hold is his head this Kansas City team has seven return touchdowns this season and one of the reasons Raymond's even up for tonight is the fact that two tight ends were injured AJ Derby and Virgil grains they brought up an extra receiver and kick returner and the biter Norwoods a subtle feeling kick so here to the 34yard billion short answer was Dave taupe is the specialty since many years in Chicago this guy really does a tremendous job get a good kicker good punter good coverage teams and of course that's the that's the hidden thing in the National Football League every struggle of offense and defense but so often it's that special teams group that makes so much of a difference should keep them in the Sun the other side the Bronco special teams coach and he's been a really good walk through the years Cowboys so had Devin a little bit second inning give us the call timeouts Kansas City resistance so it's a 30second find out second down and eight and II read so many good years in Philadelphia course the whole thing in Philly you all know that's just you know can the Lombardi Trophy ever the rolled down Broad Street got em close into the playoffs most years got into a Super Bowl which you did in Jacksonville lost in New England but couldn't get that brass ring a lot of really good teams though and I'd say he's done it again here in Kansas City did it immediately to after a little bit of a slow start they went on secondly go getting back done because he wasn't acting to the 10 is here'sh the tight end that's all they needs one more weapon over here right and he's pretty good he comes out of alders one our basketball player guys that can do this and I'm sure he's a little fired up after missing that one may have been down back a bit if buddy there's the challenge flag yeah it has to come out it will and they're gonna take this one back cost them about I guess twelve or so yards out of the 24 so Kubiak throws the challenge flag and challenging the ruling on the field that the receiver who got up and ran is not down by contact all right the final verdict when we come back after reviewing the play the Kansas City receiver was down by contact at the 24 yard line therefore will be his city's ball pushed down and Denver will not be charged with the timeout and Denver still has a challenge if they need it there's the contact need down contact made by Todd Davis so instead of having the ball first in gold at the 10 its first in 10 to 24 now one of the big differences in this game tonight has been the storyline for the Broncos all season long just 37 yards rushing tonight there are three guys on the Kansas City Chiefs with more rushing yards than that including Alex Smith we've got a figure to corner 53 total yards in a game for KC 176 and on the run passes flush by German McIlhenny former Eagle taken up by Chris Harris see the four second and six you know and anytime you got Macklin is sort of your fourth threat on an offense that's pretty good to peel Barrett getting walked over to the sidelines where they're gonna be a lot of questions around this Denver team starting immediately after this game and a lot of them will start at the quarterback position as most discussions begin when you don't have an ace back there now then you know who some of the rumors are gonna be about let me let me think about that I give you a quarter of a second second down and six of the makes the catch and his mother so my lips are sealed but his initials are TR TR you know you don't have a guy is talented it's tony romo that the all the speculation is going to start very early you know and everybody you talk to they really are excited about the future of these two young quarterbacks Trevor Simeon and Paxton Lynch but when you have a defense like this you want to play for world championships right now you know you don't keep them together forever so never know get it once Peyton Manning in a war didn't look lost while around if there are two pretty thought he was the guy in the future 37 overgrown so it's 4th question is now city kick the field goal and make this a three secession lead watch bond Miller even when plays he's not involved they kind of cut him and he keeps on his feet and then falls back underneath the throwing Lane and basically impacts Alex miss throw this will be a 39yard a tempered Santos who has already missed one thrown that exact distance Lucky's didn't try to leap over the center which and Santos's tip is good to make it a threepossession p77 yeah we are back in Kansas City Sunday Night Football wrapping up next week we go to Detroit final game of the year we make Detroit for all the marbles in the NFC north Raymond downs it in the end zone Denver's bold down 27 to 10 so there's your quarterbacks of the present on the left on the right maybe the quarterback of the future Paxton Lynch they traded up to get him and of course the man who will make a lot of decisions in this offseason John Elway take one of those three I'll take Christmas past if we get you will send me an island first down by Marcus Peters intentions for Thomas oh we're speculating we're talking about tony romo this is where this is where like kid bitching meets lather but it's good I mean it's part of what we what we do in our line of work you know it's not as if Tony Romo can get out of there to get away right yeah they got a Pam and if you pay Tony Romo all that money then you gotta let some other guys go on your team and on your defense and they have to basically free quarterbacks right now with these young guys second chance in they really held Thomas and check the night that old Thomas and sailors pull in check the night Sanders it's got one pass to 26 Thomas three now four twenty wonderful of nine yards and the problem for Gary Kubiak is he's a running guy and they don't have their fullback they don't have their two tight ends in here and so now they're starting running back and so they're not a running team four weeks sir down and four bankers way down she's territory to the Kansas City 43 and we talked about Trevor Semyon but look at this throw there's on the end of the line of scrimmage young man that's been playing awfully well for Jordan Taylor they call him sunshine but he's been making some plays down the field really and red hot as of late become a much bigger factor on as twentyseven since the wall under 50% is 1536 just throws that one into the ground D Ford was the guy who was busting through again he's at his big night number 55 second 210 trying to set up the screen underneath and so just running everything off but that time ramita Wilson saw it all the way and made the play so these linebackers now we're starting to figure out a few things on their own Terrence Smith came in there did okay to meet Wilson but really the Broncos never challenged them as far as trying to run the football at those linebackers and secondly Booker picking up steam with me it'll be third down and short and they've done so much but Demonte Booker is going to have a lot of tape to watch this all season and how do you run these stretch plays these inside zone plays that are so much the fundamental part of Gary Kubiak offense and they thought maybe bringing it Justin Forsett he would understand it it just takes a while you gonna play poor Donald Stevenson we already know false start offense number 71 fiveyard penalty remains third down hmm probably flinch if you had Chris Jones only a 2/3 full started on Stevenson tonight third down the 41 and it's changing the offensive linemen stainless swords have created it and he's at the bottom of the file but Scofield another chance changes any recovered Scofield was the guy who also had his hands on it he couldn't Corral it and the Chiefs wound up with the football I've never seen a ball shoot that poor in the air before anxious to see what happened here just got it out by Daniel Sorensen and then it looked like Scofield was gonna run for the first down for a minute and he lost it there we go got to be a little tighter with the football in that this way came down after the play nicely done there by Daniel Sorensen been asked to play a lot of roles and illusion of the play I support something like gone duck Denver number 71 15yard penalty first down we don't want to mention his name because it's Christmas poor Donald second then returned over tonight a little ugly from here well do ya be the reigning champs are gonna have one more game this is not going to mean anything except to stick to Kansas City and it means a lot to Kansas City if they can win because if Denver can knock off Oakland right then Kansas City jumps into the two spot and Oakland calls to the five and you know what that means Sylvester Williams right there and got two flags down on the on the play you're right it's gonna get a little revering face yes he fakes the under 92 15yard penalty will be out and first down its Sylvester Williams Matt McLain now with a big opportunity we'll put it that way very big he's got to be the guy because of all things the broken leg incurred by Derek harm shows him for the balance of this season and again what's the difference between two and five and the playoffs gigantic if you're the two seed you're off the bye week your home you have a home game and then if the number one seed gets to the championship give me go there otherwise if they get beat you have two home games give them the Super Bowl in the number five team you're getting no longer games any plan to regain sarcastically really give you the five you could actually have a home game what would have to happen is the five and the six would have to go to the championship game and then you play home but don't count on it it's never happening they just have to feel for a young man like their car though don't you I mean here has just been brilliant all year and taking over a great leadership position with that Raider team and Jack Del Rio has done such a remarkable job out there and tough tough on that whole organization he eats he severed that the pinky injury which and that looked like it was going to show him when he came back and then won the game it taped up and then a broken leg of all things just a second and seven Mauro's his way in shoes 20 yard line as we took down to five minutes to go and then recalls the timeout while one of the greatest games ever played was played in 1971 in Kansas City all municipal stadiums the Dolphins against the Chiefs there was Len Dawson at Podolak had an amazing day it was unbelievable Gero you Prem ian was the kicker the game went 82 minutes 40 seconds the longest game in the history of the National Football League that's halfway through the second overtime period 16 future halloffamers in the game Podolak was insane that day 85 yards rushing 110 yards receiving 154 in kickoff returns 1 on a punt return apart from that didn't do anything that's a first down here for a lesson what people forget about this Center rude who's in the Hall of Fame missed a field goal that would have wanted regulation if friend Mia missed the field goal in overtime and then get the gamewinner eventually Nick Buoniconti blocked a field goal in that game Lenny Johnson the quarterback on the other side still doing radio here and I did a whole lot of television with those two guys on inside the NFL's I heard a lot about that day that was that was one for the books and that that ended the initial state in part of the Chiefs history B's the following year they moved in can take them down unless such is waiting for mice little games seven yards another guy who played in that game there's Emma Thomas long time assistant coach now in the in the shell she's defensive backs coach had 12 interceptions in 1974 play it for Hank Stram yeah the other thing I liked about that is Andy Reid when he came here is having a conversation with his defensive coordinator Bob Sutton and he's talking about that game in 71 he goes I remember it so well in Miami and I was a big dolphin fan who was it they were playing again he's head coaches and Chiefs he took a little hey Jim Bob on now second three it's whistle thirddown I tell you the guy I do want to talk about though is Bob Sutton just a little big they have lost so many guys off of this defense and the defensive line Bailey and J Howard and then they lose Derrick Johnson the other starting linebacker March lower than their Justin Houston in and out for much of the year and yet game after game and after time they have done exactly what they've done here tonight come up with big plays to win football games he's done a tremendous job third and one to the outside yes it'll be a first and that will take more time off the clock let's say they are playing good sound top football what's the finish there by West trying to get that thing in there so desperately good balance though they really do have and I think they've hit on the right formula here stay with your guys stay with Kelsey stay with Tyreke he'll run the football well with these two very good backs Alex Smith out of the backfield running the ball some this looks like a formula for a team that may well make a little run here trips so he stopped the seeds yard line so this is the number two defense in the league coming in Denver Houston number one overall Harris trying to work it out on the sidelines in Kansas City 481 yards ahead almost 250 in the first quarter when they scored 21 in their 27 points yeah and that whole incident in the locker room last week may have been no big deal but was a little indicative of maybe of what's happened to this team here at the end of the season because until that Kansas City game until that Kansas City there seven and three and really it has not gone well for them after that game no trying to 62 yard field goal that didn't work we come to the twominute warning and the Kansas City Chiefs authority of cemented a playoff for it we'll still have a shot that's the division title so they're the games next week those games on CBS either at one o'clock or at 4:25 of Miami some impact there Oakland that Denver impact there in conjunction with Kansas City San Diego piece of Kansas City wins at San Diego and Oakland loses at Denver than case she would go to the number 2 seed and Oakland would drop the number 5 and I go to the NFC next week you got those games Dallas will go to Philadelphia the Dallas already has the 1 locked up Seattle San Francisco could be impactful in terms of seating Giants and Washington as well that's been still the shot to get into the playoffs and the big one is on Sunday night will be there for Green Bay again Detroit and for field 75 Eastern football night in America the NFC North title will be at stake in that book regardless of what Detroit does tomorrow night in their Monday night game against the Cowboys second down and goal from the three one yard line and it will be third down and goal and the Benedict Broncos are gonna stop the clock how about the quarterback matchup in that game next Sunday night it's not bad I mean yeah we know about Rodgers and then we won't Stanford's having a great year I'll tell you when Aaron Rodgers gets it going there are many people can match what he's doing right now and so many times this whole relaxed spelling it out and it applied to this year as well one of the Kansas City Chiefs they're gonna win their 11th dan brew it started fourandoh is going to lose seven to the last 11 guess he's going in down there version of the fridge here comes Don Terry Poe in he's no stranger to the end zone crowd loves this the biggest man to score a touchdown in a long time enough there we go it was a run because they they flipped the film on a lad take a look at this into the throw look at the photo Harris the parents would have dropped that ball in or killed a boy a play you may see that one about 10 million times the rest of your life tere ko it's three hundred and sixty pounds or whatever right for a touchdown and thrown full on this season fridge Junior meanwhile the the Broncos will store that baby away in their memory banks for next year yeah we'll see how the head shank goes afterwards to conduct here's a City number 84 using the football as a prop in a demonstration this 15yard penalty will be added on the kickoff all right that's Harris but the damage has been done Prince jr. right there I'm Terry poll looked like he was shooting a free throw on that one and I guarantee it keep to leave as a comment or two about that one and when the world champs get knocked out don't particularly want to have it rubbed in your face and I'm sure that's the way they're feeling right now no doubt this is going to make it 34 to 10 33 and a half no good 33 said little jump bash here this is a free throw watch this and this is a jump shot come up oh yeah little followthrough okay rockers may not like it but it was pretty cool they got it listed at 3:46 what do you think I'll take the over this looks speaking of that now that their 33 10 Kansas City well the the Chiefs they have been to two Super Bowls they were just super bowl one back in January of 67 losing the Vince Lombardi's Packers and then under Hank Stram one Super Bowl for the year after the Jets stunned the Colts Kansas City beat Minnesota then the lead merged in 1970 so it's been that long since this team's been in the Super Bowl they have enough they do they have enough weapons to make a legitimate run now obviously that run it's a whole lot easier if they get to play a few games right here in this thing there are tough to handle here good bounceback game form after blowing that lead a week ago to come back here same sort of situation and they brought it home you haven't lost me two games in this ballpark in the last one one to Tampa one to Tennessee have righted the ship tonight picked off bleep Freeman coming up Volkswagen postgame show Michelle the stars of the game Bob fastest wraps us begin Christmas I look at it to next Sunday all right so Hank Stram that was the last postseason game that he coached in 1971 that Christmas Day game I got to tell you one story so Hank gets fired here after the 74 season he was a toast for the first 15 years he goes to CBS can become an analyst I did a few regional games that year I did it gained in this stadium with Stram the year after it got fired I mean the town's going crazy people are in the stands yelling Hank Hank we miss you and Paul Wigan I took over as the coach that year so another way we meet with the coaches so Hank would not go to the meeting with Paul Wigan here in the stadium and Hanks office was in the stadium this is where the Chiefs offices are and Hank was meticulous dresser loved to decorate his office he doesn't go I go and I meet with Wigan and I get back to the hotel and see Hank is this one of its best incomplete did Hank ask me one thing about what Wiggins said no he wanted to know what weekend had done with the Tiffany lamp and the credenza he wanted to know what Wigan had done with the furniture in the office I heard a lot of his stories stick by man Lenny Dawson's got a whole bunch of them he said wherever you may go there was an extra bar soap around or an extra bottle of shampoo oh yeah Hank was a beauty and boy did he like to work on the suntan or a wife took the first down and to wrap up Henry strand in the years before we knew how bad the Sun was if you didn't protect yourself right he would put like bear grease on and sit there with a reflector at the pool I've heard a baby oil but Bear Creek well whatever I met me babies mamas baby girl whatever it was Kelly what's fair can be said to reflect ago in an allday pass and complete what a beauty there's so many people you go back and you watch a little bit of that game of course we're reflecting back on that 71 game but somebody guys that we're just idols you know you just as a kid you're like they were largerthanlife figures and to hear him tell all those great stories after all those years was always great fun for me circulate the ball 65 sauce power trap Henry Henry SRAM who is it the Tom Pratt who's still coaching for the Arizona Cardinals was a coach under and could still go on and Hank will not only scout the opposition in sky that world the cameras work before the work that Klose that pass is incomplete see the brothel is little hop on a plane to home wrap it up against Oakland next week Kansas City ends its season that's San Diego I talked a little bit about what they're doing on offense to give them a chance for a Super Bowl run but what I'm seeing on the defensive side of the ball in this secondary and with this pass rush that's a big part of it too they have had big nights across the board in that secondary and it looked pretty cool pretty amazing that last graphic that's been since 2000 that we've had a season sweep from Kansas City over Denver Henry Krieger Kabul who just was activated today and Denver just called a timeout so this is a little tit for tat in in a way where he had pole throwing the touchdown pass and Kubiak would just love to return that favor with a touchdown at the end we'll give you a replay but you won't have to worry about you'll see a lot of that play I love the release he had to play basketball at some point well consuming getting into the end zone Sanna he has an intercepted by error / the damage that will wrap it up and just for the records on Terry Colby comes the first guy that we know of with a touchdown past and a sack in the same season at least since 1982 we don't know what happens
