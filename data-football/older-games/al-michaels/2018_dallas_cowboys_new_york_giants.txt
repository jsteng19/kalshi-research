============================================================

finish season number 10 and ATV Stadium in Arlington Texas in the crowd of more than settling it as the Dallas Cowboys take the field said to meet the Giants on Sunday night in early detectives were ready for or intriguing matchups a wink and the spotlight is shining on the running backs as seat Elliott and the Cowboys take on sequin Barclays Giants on Sunday Night Football now Michaels Chris Gosselaar showed the boy of the Giants began the season last week in the Meadowlands losing to Jacksonville 20 to 15 they were three and 13 last year so they cleaned house new head coach new coaching staff new general manager a lot of new players but still a lot of talent on that offensive side of the ball and this is a team that feels poised for a big bounceback season then there were the Dallas Cowboys in a word they are enigmatic is this theme of contender or not a ton of questions still to be answered some of those answers may come into sharper focus tonight and Chris let's talk about their offense if you if you give up 16 points which they did last week to Carolina you don't really win the game but if you score only eight you almost never win the game how does this team get into the end zone we're gonna have to start stretching the field they were the only team in the National Football League a week ago that didn't have a play over 20 yards there's no Dez Bryant there's no Jason Witten so one of these guys within the school positions is going to have to start stepping up and making some big plays now the Jonas they were three and 13 last year but you forget they were a playoff team 11 at five two years ago what's your early take on this squad I think it comes down to one question will Eli Manning have enough time say qualm Barkley we've already seen what an amazing player he is and we've won some dynamic plays Odell Beckham who's more exciting than Odell Beckham right but can this remade offensive line give Eli Manning enough time to get the football to those playmakers dozens of compelling matchups in this rivalry through the what happens tonight Giants cowboys on Sunday Night Football what the Roman Colosseum was to the first century is what Cowboys Stadium is to the 21st century Babur with a pack to the end zone picks it off and goes in for the touchdown giggles in the engine robo on a quarterback draw by speaks can celebrate on the home turf of the Cowboys any and that is the way this stadium opened up week two back in 2009 all right time to go down at the field right now check in with Michele Tafoya Michele well Al one of the most important matchups to watch tonight is between Giants right tackle Erik flowers and Cowboys Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence flowers a former top 10 draft pick played his first full game at right tackle last week he was penalized twice in the first three plays and later gave up a sack and the fourthyear player was not too thrilled about being asked to move from left to right tackle and he told me I learned I have a lot of things to work on every week and I don't think it's gonna happen overnight but tonight he faces Lawrence who had 14 and a half sacks last season Lawrence told me he's been studying film to get a bead on where flowers is trying to set his feet among other things and he said I always feel like I'm the best player out there it's about me it's not about Eric and one more thing Lawrence told me he has been nursing a groin injury felt fine in practice but he is concerned about how it might respond tonight in this game we'll keep an eye on it hey Thank You Michelle a lot of great oneonone matchups coming your way tonight the winner of this game will wind up in a firstplace tie in the NFC East because Philadelphia was upset by Tampa Bay Washington was beaten by Indianapolis and that is object row sauce the giantsized ticker 63 and 233 Deonte Thompson been around with a few teams over the last few years only the cowboy wipeouts ready to accept the kick Giants won the toss and they deferred towels waving for the 90,000 at AT&amp;T Stadium and a booming kick will go through the end zone giving damage the ball to start things at the 25yard line and let's take a look at their starters dr. Prescott Mississippi State Ezekiel Elliott T Ohio State Tan's Williams baby Deonte Thompson Florida Colt Beasley SMU Jeff Swain Butte Community College tarah Smith USC Connor Williams taxes Joe Looney Wake Forest Zack Martin Notre Dame loyal Collins LSU Jason Garrett summed it up perfectly the other day he said it is wide receiver by committee tight end thus not starting and gun throws emits a nineyard gain so a good start that is Allen Hurns who played his comics blow on Miami and his professional ball over the past four seasons at Jacksonville Fergie no.9 talked about it all the time these are POS put a lot of pressure on these inside linebackers you fake the run to zq elliott he's frozen and then tries to get back late underneath the slant just can't get there i think that is going to be one of the primary weapons tonight for these Dallas Cowboys they did it well against Carolina and honestly one of the few things they did be willing that Tavon Austin the X Ranch was wide to the right second down and one and ships and is able to pick up the first down before he is pushed back by a passel of giants so you go back to Prescott then his third season now so he's played four games against the Giants he is two and two passer rating is a little below average five touchdowns and two picks Jason Garrett already in his fourth season as the Cowboys head coach secondmost wins and cowboys history of course only Tom Landry would ignore rowdy now at the 25yard line and taking it into the endzone East even Austin touchdown Cowboys Jason Garrett saying the other day leave that a jump on him early take a shot and there it was where was the element of danger in that game last week there wasn't one so what was the answer they were going to get their speed on the field Tavon Austin able to go the distance the explosive plays that simply were not there last week they jump right out in the first quarter and hit a huge way they got Landon Collins coming down to play the run and got one right over the top davon Austin after five years with the Rams comes over in the offseason where is the new place kicker Dan Bailey over here and that tech is good and want to start for the Cowboys a minute 20 34 seconds into the game seven to nothing his Lauren's hosted his second annual strikes for kids bowling event with boys girls club over in Frisco Cody Latimer is back for the Giants and that kick will go through the end zone off the foot of Mar and so the Giants will have it at the 25 and we go back to the touchdown you'll see Landon Collins come down and Riley go back but here's where the action is right up here generous jenkins going to miss the jam on Tavon Austin stumble a bit but with the speed that Austin has at 4.34 bad angles by Curtis Riley too much for generous Jenkins and a team that really did not even attempt many deep passes none last week and very few a season ago what a start for them that'll back him off the running game naina Leslie did not catch a pass last week that's his first as a cowboy Eli Manning will drop it off to San Juan Berkeley that overall pick in the draft that offense state in the subpoenaed of about five tackled there by Jaylon Smith so Eli he was this cowboy team of course very well it's only his 28th start against them 13 and 14 rating is about par for the league and of course he was the guy who came in here and spoiled opening night nine years ago second and four from the 31 yard line down the sideline geek throw is incomplete intended for Beckham jr. covered by Jones and let's take a look at the giant offense Eli Manning old myths sake want Berkeley Penn State Odell Beckham jr. Mizzou sterling Shepherd Oklahoma Cody Latimer Indiana Evan Engram Ole Miss Nate's older Colorado rule Hernandez UTEP John jalapeño Florida Patrick Oh mommy Michigan go blue air flow all about to you a totally revamped offensive line so the position ranks from Pro Football Focus it served down in for now step up and throw and Beckham is going to avoid attack him to pick up a first down Odell Beckham last year he was limited to four games broke his ankle against the Chargers at surgery and his back 100% healthy and the richest wide receiver in league history right now and deservedly so he's going to come right across the field here and this is his own defense there's nowhere to go against its own defense you can see makes the place well short of the first down breaks the tackle and just off and running we saw a week ago that Eli Manning win it is the toughest of moments we all know where he's going who's the rookie Berkeley so Berkeley he was drafted number two overall number Cleveland had the top pick Baker Mayfield the quarterback he was selected on top then Roger Goodell went to the podium in this stadium that's where the draft was held and he was happy his family who was thrilled as that wanted him to go to one of the New York teams the Giants had the second pick the Jets were third and he is elated to be wearing the blue second down and six from the 43 yard line blitz coming Manning flips it out juggle caught barking breaks a tackle and then goes down near the line of scrimmage got away from Jeff Keith for the moment stop though just about at the scrimmage line third down and five gonna get the Blitz Eli sees it gets it out and why not we have not seen the first guy tackle say Quan Barclay yet that's three times I think he's touched the football in the first guy missed every time it's not fair out when you're that big you have whatever 40 inch size and nobody can tackle you and open for you six feet to 33 and a hundred pounds in the thighs that Shermer the new Giants head coach was the head coach at Cleveland back in 2011 and 12 and last year did a magnificent job as the offensive coordinator in Minnesota and again they dump it off to Berkeley we room comes close to getting the first and it looks like let's see their to come in and market chest upon the spot taco Charlton makes the tackle needed five and the yellow line is right there an official as you all know so John Perry's tonight's referee and he will bring in the change to make it official let's take a look at exactly where he lands here puts his shoulder down makes a run exactly where does that need hit I think the elbow hit more than anything it was about just into the five and you gave him a pretty good spot there that's where it's down you can see where the five is in behind that and that is about halfway maybe twothirds the way through that five so matter of inches one way or another and he's a little bit short so forth that two links of a chain I think go for here don't you well midfield you're down seven to nothing you paid for a whole bunch of new stuff on that offensive line and seen worse you're going to send a putter right you just send the punting group out Riley Dixon third year in the league Asst first as a giant and cold easily sets up back at the 10yard line don't remember exactly what the stat is but I don't think the cow have stopped a third and one or fourth and one like the last 14 tries something like that so you know what the defense is and you know that's not their strong suit I don't know I would have gone it's a good point but the Cowboys have been very vulnerable in those situations so unless we have a fake here the Cowboys are going to get the ball back and they're on top seven to nothing those down off the foot of Dixon Bearcats call for made by Beasley at the 18 five minutes into the game Cowboys on top 70 last week all of them lost they went on seven but today Frank Reich gets a win Indianapolis at Washington Mike Vrabel now a Tennessee defeats Houston but Patricia Wilks and Gruden all lose we'll see about Shermer and Matt Maggie tomorrow when it's Chicago taking on Seattle on nine tonight second drive for the Dallas Cowboys beginning with the 17 empty backfield five receivers second that's the I think Thompson seventh year in the league been around first down really like what dak Prescott did he's going to look there but the holes going to be right there he's going to come back to that second read good solid protection up front a week ago against Carolina he really started taking off and running a lot more a lot sooner I thought that he needed to that time stood for him in the pocket and found his guy has got stars three for three to the outside he goes in the tunnel room Colin's chasing him down and hot ties him but not before he picks up a big gain of 20 yards watch how patient you're gonna get a real amount of time here to set up these blocks on the part of Ezekiel Elliott just take his time let everything come in let the safety Curtis Riley come in off the edge and take off and use the speeds already we've got a big play in the running game we got a big play in the passing game out of the powers the 48 now flip it to Austin it's table and Austin around the left side of the tunnel room and he picks up another first down with a gain of 17 davon Austin coming over from the ramps he was the eighth overall pick back in the 2013 draft by the then st. Louis Rams great play right here by Ezekiel Elliott you're gonna see the blitz come off the edge Elliott's going to get the football and maintain his poise and still get it out there so many times in that sort of panic situation that ends up being a bad toss that was beautifully done get it to the speedster on the outside the Cowboys looking sharp Corey Martin comes limping off the field there he is number 96 just for the moment that's why we have the stoppage of play right now with eight and a half to go in the opening frame elbows now from the 37 yard line Lorenzo Carter Martin stop Prescott keeps another big game and another first down women where the Cowboys come out explosively that's a gain of 15 Dallas already has 136 yards this is a pretty easy read right here once this in crashes down that Prescott who ran this offense in college he's more comfortable in this offense he likes to spread out look he likes running this he's reading Connor bar when he goes on this is like stealing I'm out of here four consecutive first down plays and they go with three tight ends so many losses the back of the line of scrimmage goes Iliad Alvin Tomlinson losing his lid the new defensive coordinator for the Giants watching his unit gets shredded at the moment is James Boettcher who has been with Arizona he was there under Bruce Arians and comes over as the new defensive coordinator very aggressive loves to blitz now right now in New York City has the two most aggressive defensive play callers and taught bowls at James Bechet a blitz more than anybody else in the national football second over the middle it's Elliott but he is covered very well by Ogletree and we'll take a look at that giant defense here Damon Harrison be William Penn University Dallben Tomlinson University Alabama counter Barwon Cincinnati where we are all you Alec Ogletree Georgia Bulldogs Kareem Martin North Carolina Eli Apple deal ha state university Landon Collins Alabama Curtis Riley Fresno State v WF the College of William and Mary Jinora chicas North Alabama I want to see PW put that down on third and seven Prescott buying time and that has been throw it away so the forth down the line of scrimmage the 19 so in comes the field goal unit for years it's been Dan Bailey but Bailey had a groin injury last year couldn't return to form they were a little concerned about him in training camp and Brett ma came in and won the job he's cheaper and healthier apparently at the moment Bailey still out on the street looking for a job mom missed his only attempt last week a 47yard her in Charlotte watching six times two right he connects in 37 away six minutes remaining in the quarter the Cowboys jump on top of it shots you know always talking about Dallas and Big D and all that the Metroplex Mars kick will be down in the end zone let's take a look at the damage defense demarcus Lawrence the Boise State Broncos Tom Crawford Boise State University Antwon woods USC taco Charlton University of Michigan Jaylon Smith University of Notre Dame Sean lead Penn State should obey I was yeah Colorado oh gee Jeff he Saginaw Valley State kayvon fridge central mission Anthony Brown Purdue University Byron Jones University of Connecticut the defensive group coordinator Rod Marinelli not a tectonic here as well the patches made snatching in his Odell Beckham for a gain of 12 covered by a woozy a first down they go into a little bit of their own RPO action on the other side and nobody runs the slants like this guy does Odell Beckham since he's come in the league as astronomical numbers running the simplest of all routes in the NFL his ability to make plays catching that slant making people miss and going for touchdowns has really been part of the magic of his they just snatched it out of here at camp and goes out in front of the giant's bench Kalin Smith makes the stop how dangerous is he been on those slants over this first four seasons or in all of those categories he has been the best in football against the Dallas Cowboys defense pretty good now pick that seven for seven for about 125 yards and a touchdown you want to stop the Giants on offense you have to stop Odell Beckham and there's slant route splits from the right at second down and 13 and for Barclay lost three yards Latimer sets up in the slot down a little the Giants bench for a short gain will be third down and long well we have gone quite a while here in the first quarter and not yet talked about Eric flowers or the offensive line or bad protection or a holding call or anything so it has not been the offensive line that is often criticized so much and you'll see now they're gonna move Eli a little bit and trying to add some wrinkles to that protection in this case here using red Ellison over the right side now Wayne Gulman comes in as the running back he stays in the block powers his way for a gain of about ten and little short of the first down Byron Jones makes the tackle fourth down and the Giants send the punt grouping again well this is a nice job by Eric flowers right here watch him you're going to get a slot blitz he's going to take a shot at Lawrence come out and get Anthony Brown and give Eli a chance to make a play down the field look in that right tick tackle position is really completely different for him to see if he has a marked improvement out here tonight Dixon whose first pot was 35 yards Austin the two yardline and skipping to go forth and Berkeley over the last ten seasons Trent Richardson was also in that group previous ten seasons you had nine running backs selected in the top five and what it's amounted to basically around the league is that there's a premium I tell you what I read the other day somewhere where there's something like 40 offensive lineman with higher salaries than any running back except maybe on Bell and then the pass is caught up at the 25yard line Thompson is second grab of the night it's so interesting though because it's like and you can feel it around the league people talk about what the running back he's got a shelf life and the offensive lineman as they say 40 guys have a higher average salary that says a lot yeah and I think the reason these two guys were taken in the top five is because of their ability to impact the passing game so yes they're great runners but they also have the ability to make plays in the passing game that we've already seen some of that tonight nice to get around the side and he's able to power his way for a gain of a couple after stopping the line of scrimmage it's a gain of 3 yards it's gonna make it third down and 2 that was something else now that was a twoyard loss watch this he is down right here Martin has a Landon Collins so that's 4 or 5 yards after he was stopped twice in the backfield I think there's a little competition going on tonight between these two running backs don't you get that feeling that they know what the other guy is doing and they want to be the one talked about out here here they met once in college 2015 Ohio State against Penn State in both a big day and picks up the first down so the defense goes after Elliot that good runner great runner in fact picks up 13 first and babish well this read was made a little bit easier because you're going to get John Tate Thompson coming down and blocking that 8th man in the box so the Giants came down but the Cowboys answered with that with a couple lead blockers out in front so really some nice design here tonight by Scott Linehan very creative he was criticized a bit a week ago for not being so clean if he's making up for it so far tonight he's meeting the crossers teachers thanks Elliot who has now carried the ball five times for 24 yards I mean Alec Ogletree the middle linebacker the heart of this defense has the cleanest of all shots and he's the one that pays the price bursting into zekiel Elliot his balance has been phenomenal tonight now you carry win he's not going to do that too but trying to run inside against the New York Giants very very tough snacks Harrison inside Alvin Tomlinson two of the very best against the run in the National Football receivers set to the left don't beat down the coverage is good and passes incomplete that's Thompson running down the sideline and Eli Apple covering him third down to ten I thought one of the major upgrades from what I saw a season ago was out of that young man right there Eli Apple played nearly a perfect game last week and that one against Jacksonville and has come back so far in this one you know a lot of controversy about him Landon Collins and he's kind of a cancer of what my boss has been and all those things came back Pat Shermer came in the heck with all that I don't care we're starting over and so far you can see it in the play of E laughs first round draft choice of the Giants in 2016 the Prescott going deep down the sideline again Apple covering this time it's Michael Gallup a rookie third round draft choice out of Colorado State who is as speedy as they come for them well again you have to give Eli Apple credit this was a great throw it really was but watch how Apple works Michael gallop into the boundary here so there's really no room to fade he would have been out of bounds anyway in this league in this league you have to find a way to make that release and press inside to have a little room to fade to the boundary Chris Jones will put a hunter short kick a little bit of a cowboy hop and he's down at the 23yard back to 30 seconds with tonight's nextgen stats powered by a W into the same name good luck to carry hopefully a seventh consecutive record for her now Michaels Chris Collins with Michele Tafoya to start the second quarter Cowboys on top ten to nothing each team coming in all and one Jonathan Stewart the longtime Carolina Panthers in his 11th season started with Carolina played the super bowl with them it'll be third down and nine and now comes the key moment and protection so far in this game we've seen Eric flowers do a nice job Nate soldier on the other side came over from matrix basically not one single offensive lineman in the in position or on the same team as a season to go for the Giants they're coming together a little better in this one so far than a week ago they're gonna blitz and they do and Manning wins away fatigue get away taco Charlton they're number one pick last year out of Michigan for a second a big loss a 13yard sack here's the power we see this sort of double a blitz all the time what does it do force the line to slide in and here you come nobody on the outside blocks taco Charlton the Eli Manning saw it he just got the heck out of Dodge so don't blame the offensive line on that one that was just a pure scheme sack Dixon already his third punt we always dangerous team an Austin midfield he drifts over cost for the flag is down makes it the 44yard line the line of scrimmage carries had a quiet night tonight you got a hold against the Cowboys it was during the kick 22 holding return team number 55 10yard penalty first down just March it off at the end of the play that's on Van der etch their number one draft choice the Cowboys last week in Carolina they had 60 yards in the first half period tonight already 160 of course the big play was the 64 yard touchdown pass on that first series to Tavon Austin there he is number 10 again heath overall pick they loved in the Rams did he pick on with the Swiss Army knife he can do so many things running back receiver put him in the slop of them outside and return kick and chase and then present into his own bench chase by Lorenzo Carter says Prescott comes in remember Tony Romo got her two years ago Prescott took over fourth round draft choice and had a tremendous rookie season it was dak and seek and the Cowboys played very well that year then last year a lot of it had to do the Elliot suspension you didn't know when he would leave and he was every week he was like week to week and then he was out for six games and back told us and we were here a couple of weeks ago for a preseason he said I just tried to do too much trying to leave his way that's a nice tackle by olga tribune working his way through the trash here to knock him down it'll be third down and seven yeah really Alek Ogletree is the heart and soul of this defense and it's happened very quickly James Boettcher who is the defensive coordinator said he has just been startled at the football mind he's the guy that wears the speaker in his helmet they communicate they sort of make the game plan almost together it's Ogletree it'll bring back suggestions and vice versa he really is the coach on this defense third and seven now let's would send only for home with great effectiveness as Lorenzo Carter rookie out of Georgia Lorenzo Carter played at Georgia played against Vanderbilt where Pat schirmer's son is the quarterback in Shermer sunset you should draft this guy while Collins right here is going to get to people they did this to him a week ago he has to take the inside of the tube and so then it's up to dak to just to get rid of the football on the outside they faked the Blitz inside got the protection to slide down and really nothing for dak to do Chris Jones to kick receive it on the side of his foot plays Nepal for a fair catch and he's troubled that he had trouble last week at the end of the game and has two short hop that one then gets decked at the 25 by Damien Wilson who may have it as issues tend to nothing dumps damned Arnold so last week let's take a look at the comparison 106 yards for Barclays 68 on one play Darla's the course started with interception then played great against Detroit today he becomes the youngest guy to ever throw for over 300 yards but the Jets were down 20 than nothing and succumb 22 12 to the now to an old dolphin so Berkeley is in there right now good protection we're trying to spin away and attend the Giants decided not to draft a court it was really fascinating in the draft Bushnell here so Cleveland had the purse but he had five quarterbacks who eventually would go in the first round and the Giants then after Baker Mayfield was off the board then had their choice of the other quarterbacks or Berkeley or somebody else and they chose to go running back which was a great vote of confidence at least for the moment free live Manny second he pays the price at the line of scrimmage so in your assessment mr. Cris Collinsworth what you think of the move the Giants made it would have been hard for me to not take Sam Darnell just be honest the quarterback position is so significant in the NFL Eli it is best maybe another three or four years but if your patch Shermer and you start thinking about it you go okay what am I gonna do I'm gonna put him on the bench behind Eli Manning that's not going to help me win any games I need to win games right now they took what they considered to be the best player in the entire draft and that was safe walk bar and the new GM Dave gentlemen of course extremely instrumental in that decision third down and six in the outside goes to pass he's trying to get that first down as Barclay and he's out of bounds the Giants are upset you can see the sideline there they don't like the spot at all but he shoved out a yard shy of the first down so where did the ball cross the line that's what the controversy is going to be the move out there that is close so was EA so Sherma could challenge it that's the kind of challenge it almost always stands on a play like that but for the moment they got a line up on fourth down and wanted to go for it Dallas is gonna call a timeout it caught them offguard Matt Shermer a Center at Michigan State and his playing career then he coached their assistant coach in East Lansing for ten years take a look at this well it's what's gonna go out of bounds right now right there and that ball is at least a half yard behind the marker so I think the officials as they usually do got it right most of the time most the time that's all the time kinda sorta yeah but I would go I would have gone for the other one so I would have gone for this with two but this one honestly is probably a little bit tougher decision because you're back into the 35yard line you're almost giving away points if you don't make this one the other one it was closer to the fifth if you talked about that a while ago the Cowboys very vulnerable all last season in last week as well on third and one fourth and one so here we are will they really go for it they will and Manning on a seat will pick up the first down you know what's really interesting about that is I think you have to play say Quan Barclay right they did not cover the gap in front of Eli Manning they basically gave him look at this so Eli Manning said thank you very much I'll take that they were basically looking for say Quan Barkley and his thighs that come powering in there and the 37 year old guys that I'll just take that thing do you know the last time he attempted to sneak on a third one or fourth and one 2010 was the last time he's launching with the now man who's going to go down and a sack at the 30 California gets the Senate yeah and I'm a little surprised we're seeing the Dallas Cowboys now bring in some pressure I really felt like they would feel like their defensive line could get pressure so far they really have it so now they're starting to send some linebackers in they look to that space but they have some guys that can really fly Shawn Lee Jaylon Smith and that was good by Joe Thomas trips to the left and has taken down at the 40 yard line that seven yards short of the first nine broke enemy would be tackled by Kavon Frasier will be third down let's call it six I would do this a lot if I had Eric flowers on the right side so many times guys pressure to the inside now they didn't do it here but his real weakness is getting beat to the inside so what's perfect for that the outside screen and we've seen what an effective ball carrier portly is when he catches the past third and seven that's coming this in five and that is caught not that short of the first down his heaven Ingram Jeff II now with the Giants go for it again this time out at the 47 yard line I'd say what we have seen the speed of Jeff Heath come into play before Evan Engram actually at the combine ran a faster 40 time Dan dead Odell Beckham in yet that was Jeff Heath coming out of center field and running him down short of the first down made a game saving tackle it last year Eli's going to try it again so it's something he hasn't done in eight years he does it and then he tries it again neaten into yard they put it right where the yellow line is so that would indicate it's a likely first now Mary backs up and signals first down New York yeah for me once right that time there was Tyrone Crawford going down there's a gap right there but I'm come in that was Eli and all second effort that got that done that was really a good play by Eli Manning he did not have it there he had to get to there to pick up that first down and get by Sean leading to flying through so backtoback first down sneaks seven and a half at the 33yard number there's a flag down that's Frazier on a safety blitz look at Perry's coal flag is down to the 45 yard line three yards back of the line of scrimmage against the Giants and Perry looking over to Garrett saying what do you want to do yeah no matter what it is I think you're gonna take that zag aren't you would think most person ten that was a 13yard sack holding offense number seventy six felonies decline second down second twenty three veteran venerable Rod Marinelli defensive coroner defensive line okay he's got some help right now to his Chris Rashard is the passing game coordinator over from Seattle and he knows his stop he has really helped these young corners took that bring down and Jones is able to body him down after a gain of 13 yards bringing up a third down and eight for the Giants you know Evan Engram is one of those guys that could become a really special player in this league he is so fast for for to running from the tight end position and yet he has the tendency to put the ball on the ground he drops about one in every 10 passes throughout the course of his career as you can see when his confidence gets going he has the ability to create some separation and opportunities for Odell on the outside say Mon Moulin Rouge Eli Ole Miss he was their leading receiver last year throws and that's incomplete Beckham covered by Frasier and this time the Giants will putt they are really struggling with this slot blitz the Giants are it is just one after another give Rod Marinelli some credit he's found something at work and it's really forcing the hand of Eli much before he wants to throw this football just has to get it out of his hand well short of the first down wouldn't have picked it up anyway it was a weird drive 11 plays 23 yards Beasley back there also the FairTax and makes it inside the ten yard line six and a half to the half the cowboys on and in this part final for Connecticut one Jones fingered Stephen Jerry and Jerry junior NBA allstar game WrestleMania you name it they've had it start from the 9 yard line with some action upfront false start offense number 77 half the distance first up so that Styron's smith now the center is Joe Looney because that man Travis Frederick is out we don't know for how long he n/bar a syndrome that's an immune system attacking the body's nervous system he was diagnosed with that in August having treatment right now we're told that's going very well but there's no indication no timetable for exactly when he can return or even begin to try to get into football shape but a great guy Pro Bowl perennial and we wish him the very best obviously yeah and it's a major impact on this office everybody in his team and Ezekiel Elliott was leading the charge saying that he is the smartest guy on this team the calls he makes upfront so its first in 14 penalty's half the distance to the goal gives them some breathing room the good thing about Frederick is they believe they caught it early enough but the Cowboys had to make a decision as to whether to put him on injured reserve which would have probably cost him the whole season or keep on the active roster so for the moment he is on the active roster that's how good he is when those three guys play together and you have Zack Martin and you have tyrants but Travis Frederick that's as good as any offensive line but crap and that's brought by Terrence Williams through the 24 yard line for a first thousand Travis talking about it when you're injured just trying to get past it something I can't just to will my way through matter of the nerves not conducting properly and not working correctly focus getting back to being here give the play again a matter of time for that to happen unfortunately he doesn't know what that the time will be brilliant guy he's smart beyond football spar to hear that term after the 29 yard line oval tree makes the tackle gain of five second and five and we're Elliott thus far tonight eight carries for 39 yards about Connor Williams the former tackle in college starting to figure this whole guard thing out gonna pull around right there and lead the way through he had a pretty tough game the last game against Carolina but Kay one short about as good as you could possibly get in this league and in particular that position so Connor only get easier from there and the Giants are right there to corral Elliot for next to no gain sitting up third and what's caused for you have great players inside Zack Martin in particular gonna get the double team against stack Harrison right there and just watch what he does he does this better than anybody in football he gobbles up blocks he doesn't let the center get off to get to the second level those linebackers he's not moving you can try and move snacks but he's not moving and he has one of the most brilliant senses of humor we've ever interviewed on the best meetings ever survey third down and four Brown wants a flag and it comes in fact two flags on the play clearly BW Webb had a hole of cold Beasley automatic first down as soon as dak Prescott sees man coverage there's one guy he believes him one guy he has faith in and it's goal people interference defense there we go you're gonna see Beasley going up against BW Webb just a little quick move to the outside back inside and the grab right there good call try started the Dallas 9 yard line to the 38 there's got cheese throws a little too high trying to hit Rico gathers who was a great basketball player at Baylor and the guy who was kind of on the bubble at the end of training camp but they feel he's got enough potential they want to keep him around too tight in that's what he's supposed to do right there he's supposed to be a rebounder this guy has not played in a meaningful basketball earning full football game since junior high school it's unbelievable he's now playing in the National Football League they're going to use him on the red zone they'll use them on some seam routes are going to use him as a rebounder he's not a fast athletic almost intercepted right into and out of the arms of Conner Barwon play for the Rams last year former school bow bowler back in 2014 it was right there and speaking of senses of humor that guy has won but he's a former basketball player I guarantee he's sick he was a rebounder too and he almost rebounded Allen so far we've seen dak with plenty of time but that one was almost taken right Eli Apple was in pretty good position and by third down a 10 will Eliot into the slot to the left side there's no the Giants corral them immediately Barwon in on the tackle and the Cowboys will punt for the third time in the game I tell you what that was a missed opportunity right there for the Dallas Cowboys they came with a slot blitz off of that side if you could design a defense that's what you would have asked for and they just blew it they did not make a block on Alec Ogletree and it cost them well it's been an adventure for that guy Caitlin clay left the putt cost them a chance to drive for maybe a gamewinning touchdown last week and then really know what to do that fair catch and got away with it when you shore not so is he gunshot not he's been take this at the 15yard line and see what he can do and it's not much as he's taken down to the 20yard 2:49 until halftime ten to nothing for stanley cup banner against the Boston Bruins hockey beginning October 3rd on NBCSN jaian start from the 20yard line iit's only 54 total yards thus far on the hand caught anal about their to Evan Engram Pauling in his third reception of them yeah and right now Rod Marinelli is winning this battle he is basically taken away say Quan Bartley three rushes for four yards he is dictating what's happening here at the first two you can get the first and a lot more goes wrong and then starts to stumble this against the 30yard line Giants have all of their timeouts plus the twominute warning 210 and ticking down he's not a quarterback but it sure is fun to watch him play isn't it I mean it seems like every first opportunity to tackle him has been missed so far in this game that takes us to the twominute warning 1st down Giants when we come back to Ireland in so yeah the halftime will come your way very shortly about Ryan Fitzpatrick down it anthem unbelievable shining on the field that at the mic Sunday in 60 seconds festive week 2 and node L catch invitation from this weekend that you will want to see coming up at the half 1st down Giants from the 38 down 10 to nothing and they walk through time which guns the coverage is very good sterling shepherd it's the first time that the Giants number two receiver to Beckham has been targeted the nine Anthony Brown good coverage deadon here and we were seeing once again these Cowboys defenders understanding what's being done to them they brought both linebackers on a blitz right there and once you saw Shepherd go with that outside release all Anthony Brown did just pin them into the sidelines this team is really much better coach with Christmas chard he makes two tax breaks a tackle and then gets taken down Jeff Heath's would be tackle it turns a loss into a gain of nine yards it's going to be third down and one at the 47 yard line Barkley's caught eight passes tonight but only 32 yards and ours forward to the 49yard line for a person out of and arrest him number one draft choice makes the stop with all three time ask but not using one yet now the Cowboys not really disguising when they want to go man coverage it looks like they're going to do it again so some opportunities outside the slot glitch in trouble and he's going to go down in the arms of DeMarcus Morris timeout is not taken by the Giants and we're back in 30 there are roadside attractions and then there's our worldfamous unknown attraction the 2019 GLC starting at forty thousand seven hundred mercedesbenz the best or nothing fourteen and a half sacks last season for demarcus Lawrence tied for second League behind Chandler Jones comes in here and knocks him down just set a simple little loop that is an easy pickup or should be for Patrick or MAME or John jalapeño whoever in there sterling Shepard but it's going to be third down and very long Joe Thomas makes the stop Beckham tonight has caught two for 20 yards Ingram 3 and the man shooting it out to Berkeley in the flat eight times third and 14 a little more protective here don't think they'll blitz and trouble again and just has to flip it away with 15 seconds so that was pretty ugly fourth and 14 and the Giants to punt again fifth time in the hand they're picking on the right side of the Giants offensive line he's going inside this time this is called the et they did it just the opposite of what worked the last time in the combination between omame and Eric flowers they need to get on the same page over there those are pretty simple stunts why is it called the e2 and goes first and then attack one day from court at the 15 yard line by Tavon Austin with six sticks who claim the PGA Tour's ultimate prize the race for the FedEx Cup ends at the Tour Championship you're getting Thursday on Golf Channel continuing Saturday on NBC leaderboard is a great one he Shambo up on top rows for now Johnson and Thomas and we had the pleasure of meeting Bryson defend bow at a restaurant Nichkhun Sam's here the other night in Dallas and he's ready to go all the big stars hang out kind of gal Michael yeah I said is a good swing thought please God don't let me live he said no I would change I won that that's the way the first half ends an explosive start for the Cowboys and not too much since but they leapt into nothing and coming up next to at a halftime let's go to Mike Tirico to tell you what's on tap Mike I'm Manning 16th of 20 good percentage but only 97 yards listen five yards per attempt at he's been sacked four times Prescott started redhot but since then he's three out of ten the 17 yards meanwhile Berkeley eight catches most by a Giants rookie running back in team history about four yards per grab five points five drives no touchdowns in their last six quarters a game and a half here at AT&amp;T Stadium Giants will get the ball to start the third quarter the Giants just 79 yards of total offense in the first half Brett Maher send it down former Denver Bronco brings it out faster 20 out to the 30yard line and that's where the Giants set up shop and we go to Michelle well Pat Shermer told me obviously they did get better pass protection for Eli Manning so they can stay on schedule in down and distance and get safe Juan Barclay back involved in this thing their punt returner Caitlin clay was carted off just before halftime with a right ankle injury he is questionable Jason Garrett said his offense has been in much better rhythm than they were last week they kept ahead of the chains and they are also looking to get their run game going here in the second half out all right Michelle certainly early on Al Michaels Chris Collins with Michele Tafoya Sunday Night Football week to Berkeley is the running back Latimer setting up in the slot to the left side a heralded rookie is stuck by the Marcus Lawrence well here's the matchup we were talking about coming into the game Eric flowers going against the Marcus Lawrence and I know everybody wants to say how terrible flowers is and he had a few bad moments in that first half but it was not bad especially when you're considering you're playing against the 14 and a half sack guy so they just have to be a little more solid what would concern me was some of the stunts they ran on that side seam tape a puddle the right side of the offensive line just the pit and I'm sure they're gonna come right back to them I know the concern is that when Ingram comes out of the game and he's on his back Shepard but he's gonna reach back and make the grab and pick up the first down malucia with the coverage and there is anger him on the sideline watch this throw by Eli Manning the receiver was not even close to turning around and looking for that football that thing was thrown to an absolute spot almost no way for a woojae to make the play in a 14 the Giants longest play of the game ground ball into the hands of sparkling and incomplete they can get second down and ten yeah and they're they're leaving people in the block and you know this is this has to be a time for Odell Beckham to take over I mean that's as much space as he's ever going to get and they're coming out on early downs and basically saying all right let's see what you got out here giving a little credit on the outside to Byron Jones that converted safety he's been doing pretty well good news for the Giants Ingram is back in the game he's on a wing to the right is it one is it one just be good until after Manning loses and he gets sacked and the Cowboys come up to the ball Wilson with the sack the ball is out Sharpton with the recovery five sacks now of Manning they are blowing to many assignments right here will Hernandez going to help down but that's his guy he's got to get back out there that's another free runner at Eli Manning and so far this game has been won by Rod Marinelli the combinations of pass rushes and blitzes and he has put together has just befuddled this offensive line out there not getting beat physically that's what's got to be so frustrating for the New York Giants they're getting beat with scheme and nobody's happier about it and that guy right there Jason here up at the 27yard line start their first drive of the hand with great field position and start on the ground for a oneyard gain here by Elliot taken down by Snax Harrison for Elliot tonight ten carries 41 yards yeah this is snacks Harrison you want to run at him he's like yeah go ahead because it's not easy you know Looney gets driven back and you can see the bench press see him get his arms inside and and just bench press that 300 pounder right off easily that comes into the backfield those 20 yard and breaking a tackle getting the first down is the update Thompson while reporter more Raven owns a Super Bowl ring with them first down Dallas yeah we can remember Al and we came in here jinora's jackrabbit Jenkins used to stay with Dez Bryant right no matter where he went on the field but now there's really not that main guy that you have to cover on this team and the more of these other guys that are catching footballs for dak Prescott the more openness offense to the right side to the left side who's taken out of bounds let you mentioned is bright we haven't mentioned tonight I mean obviously if you follow football you know Bryant released and we know Jason Witten is in the Monday night booth so those are the two mainstays through the years and it's a it's running backwards it's it's wide receiver and tight end by committee for that man yeah I mean they're looking for answers and they made a decision that they were going to draft the linebacker instead of a wide receiver in the firstround say they really need somebody to step up so far that some money's meant Avon Austin got a full battle ami is wide to the right near the sideline because it is on the outside and zone but it's incomplete and that was Rico gathers who was able to get free got away from Curtis Riley for the past incomplete third and six that was the great route gathers had him he pinned this guy inside hat the entire corner open and they just missed the throw that's what a blitz will do you can see BJ cuts and just falling down and that would have been nice for gathers get one to get him started from the 11 this is when jason witten and des pet would come into play now who is that they're looking Kelly don't get bumped out of bounds well short of a first down so they'll send in the field goal group to try to make it 13 to nothing it just makes such a difference because quarterbacks tend to stay on a trusted person and there's things better over on the sidelines letting his feelings be known but that was a heck of a job after the turnover for this Giants defense to hold up now the offense just has to come up with some answers 29 yard attempt for the new cowboy kicker Brett Marr and lead and he boots that one through with 10:43 to go in the third quarter at AT&amp;T Stadium it's 13 to nothing nemesis high school football in Texas big big big Connor Williams that position high schoo the belt where would you fly in here at night on a Friday nights and we do from time to time seems like there's a high school field about every three blocks doesn't it Stadium after stadium it is the yard in Lattimer we're coming out it's decked up at the 24yard line by Joe Thomas so if you start one and one since 2002 when they align the divisions the way they are right now if you start 1 and 1 you have a 41% chance to make the playoffs if you start owing to the percentage is 11% so if you start on to one team out of nine makes it to the playoffs you should add one to it if you can't pick up simple stunts you're not gonna win it that's all I mean just no way I mean Eli Manning can have the greatest players outside in the world but they can't let free runners come out you know that's that's been the difference in this game right now they're coming out with a couple of tight ends and maybe just saying let's just see if we can Mack's protective a the ocean Berkeley out to the 30yard line Berkeley as you know the number two overall choice he was born in the Bronx grew up there and then the family moved to eastern Pennsylvania went to school at Penn State his greatuncle is Iran Berkeley boxing fans will remember him great for the most part middle weight and a guy who actually duped it out with Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran during his career he never had the jersey sales that this guy no I have never seen as much hype around a Blair nice run out of bounds and that moves the sticks you know I'm starting to buy the hype too because we just have not seen a first tackler get him on the ground yet not only is he fast but he has quick moves and he has those big thighs and he has he has a lot of stuff he's been catching a lot of passes before you hate to think you take him out of this offense tonight where they might be and really the sad part about it if they can't improve the protection they just cannot get the ball to Odell Beckham and he's had opportunities oneonone you can't ask for a lot of better looks there he is in the slide down Stewart is the running back we pass is almost intercepted who have duck they're intended for Beckham Wilson covering on the play and we go to Michelle hey I asked Odell Beckham about say Quan Barclay and he said that's my guy I trained with him in the offseason he's a one play away guy and to watch someone do what he does it's a lot of fun he loves his teammates works hard he's young and hungry and I love that it gives a boost to me as well he makes me want to step up and I think we elevate each other now Michelle right now there's a timeout because Byron Jones was trying to get to his feet and he staggered and then down he goes at the 48 yard line the Cowboys cornerback by the way our Our Lady Michelle doing her 250 NFL game tonight way to go back after this vortex Florence to nine own nine nine nine to give $10 or more to American Red Cross hurricane relief thinking about you guys second down and ten keep that feel is Cody Latimer who makes the great catch meeting illusia with tight coverage the former Denver Bronco holding it in Oh going up against the Cowboys best and a whoosh a and this is the first catch as a giant for Cody Latimer last week I thought there were several opportunities because he was on the backside of Evan Engram and Odell Beckham they finally work it to him he comes up it was 37 yards first at the 25yard line first time the Giants have been in cowboy territory tonight and dancing and spinning and going nowhere Latimer is a guy we first heard about him when he was in Denver and Peyton Manning was there and Peyton was rehab and he said he and Latimer were working every day and then Peyton told Eli about him and he becomes the third guy to catch a pass from both Peyton brothers circle like the Manning brothers Peyton and Eli like to be one that caught touchdowns from each of them but it does help balance the field because I mean what are you trying to do you're trying to get the ball to Odell Beckham but you have to get double coverage and things like that off of him sidesteps throws and it slack tackled by Anthony Brown and that's gonna make it Emperor ghena for third down in six for New York that was pretty interesting I think Odell had an opportunity on this one watch the little hesitation and go yeah the ball came out but he had a shot the fraction too early there back in he missed a couple of plays and that secondary third down tonight two out of nine on the top of the screen one one up there against Jeff Heath there's no help that's where they're going to take their shot that can coming out of the slot to the right Manning looks left crows CAW it's going to be a first down in more Barclays trying to stay in bounds and it'll make it first down and goal as he catches his ninth pass of the game yeah the Cowboys got burned by the Blitz that time they bring Shawn Lee on the inside but unfortunately that meant the Jaylon Smith as fast as he is had to run across the formation and just no way Barkley is too fast 73 yards on this Drive so far in seven plays first and goal the clock and one just get it off to the outside we won't get as a flag down miss Barkley is not out of bounds for a six yard loss and penalties against the Giants holding puppets 485 tenure Finley you know do you want to take the penalty to the play here drive them back I guess watch this right here by dorrance Armstrong he is going to take newsman straight back in the backfield and they just could run to play I mean that just destroyed him from the beginning and I think was also the whole Scott Simon you know you want to make it to X first that and dole from the 13 your option was to make it second and go from the nine I probably would have declined second down and goal under six minutes to go in the third quarter and just get the feeling this is going to be the shape of this offense this year and that is I'll appeal the the center John Howe appeal the center is the man on the surface good he played well last week mmm go up a sack a hit or a hurry in his debut and it looks like they're gonna move Giangreco in for them well not a sight you ever want to see with the air cast on them and I'll appeal we'll go to the locker room he's a guy who won the starting job in fact they let Brett Jones go to Minnesota he had been the center before the season and then we'll get Michelle obviously to check in as to exactly what the situation is but clearly the serious injury to Hal appeal here and here's exactly what happened it just happens you know you get rolled up on the back ear leg and it's unfortunate and he's played well Westin Richburg was a free agent went off to San Francisco and now this new look giants offensive line that's working so hard to get a little cohesiveness going now has the centerpiece of the entire thing in there Center John jalapeño out and so it's like starting all over it yeah and Giangreco mainly a guard a guy who's played for patch Shermer in st. Louis and in Cleveland he's been around a long time 11 years so he is the man right now I'm doing the snapping on second down and goal of the faith the end zone Shepard reciever the Marcus Lawrence put the heat on that tongue man he's already gone down five times it'll be third down and goal DeMarcus Lawrence let's just give him credit this guy is something special dealing with the groin injury watch him blast through the two Titans trying to block him spin move he has been all over align Manning that was a fairly slow developing play with backs protection crossing route that guy right there would not let it hold tenth play of the drive the big play the drive was the 37 yard pass to Latimer manning under pressure again stepping away and gets clobbered at the 10yard line by Jaylon Smith so Manning everybody covered that defense to integration on the coverage has been terrific on the back end and its fourth and goal Jaylon Smith was coming but watch Barclay here get in the middle of the field and if he'll I could see him had his eyes up might have had a shot there instead he took an unbelievable shot from Jaylon Smith and give him credit that is so perfectly clean he liked going for the goal line and ended up going towards the other goal temple altar gross sauce low snap but getting the ball down was Riley Dixon nicely in the Giants finally get on the board with four and a half minutes to go in the third Eli and the price but the Giants get through to close within ten we'll see at Tuesday's this fall on NBC's or the Tarrant County Courthouse on the Sunday night in the Metroplex Dallas leaving thirteen to three Cowboys and the Giants blocking horns since the Cowboys came into the league in 1960 and Dallas will begin this drive from the 25yard line so the first attack Prescott of course you get Eliot leading the league in rushing as a rookie both touchdowns one interception off play action highest passer rating in the lead but in 17 with Elliot great number of the arrow without him 75 so Elliot missing those six games through the season came back but truly for the Cowboys to get into the playoffs he finished nine and seven but no postseason four and a half remaining in the third those caught there by the enemy Thompson for a gain of five yards Thompson now with four catches for 33 yards I liked it when you asked Ezekiel Elliott if anything positive came from the suspension he said nope sometimes people who suffer adversity and you say hey you know what how did you come out of this I mean anything good about it find something no he was very clear about it and that thing lingered rummy but they know the B and E out or whatever finally was gone six games as he takes it again we gain of about four to be third down and one for damage well now you've got meat up your web playing the left outside cornerback position for the New York Giants and already you're seeing the adjusts by Curtis Riley the free safety at the snap of the ball is moving that way effectively to give help to BW Webb so now the oneonone opportunities are going to be against number 22 Norris Jenkins on the other side and there's the matchup we saw early Tavon Austin against Jenkins we'll have another opportunity joining brilliant the outside and turning it back at the picnic the first down is the former Ohio State star with freaking the only one floor accepted penalties this over 71 10yard penalty third oh boy oh Collins so even when offensive lineman pull out like that al what happens and we see it all the time so they're gonna grab a little Jersey and that's perfectly legal he's gonna pull out here and then when the defender tries to pull away that's when it becomes obvious to the official that he has a grab on it right there the officials said uhhuh got that now you're back looking at 25 for a third day let's just a fourman rush a strike the flag is down Thompson whatever first down if it stands we see against in the offensive backfield there will be against Dallas holding offense backtoback holds the consternation on the face of Garrett that's Jeff's lean house lock blitz on the part of the Giants and you'll see Swain as he starts to get around does a little loop around that shoulder pad and that's what gets called let's say a dak has done a much better job understanding when there's pressure this game and when there's not I think missing that third preseason game really hurt him he was not sharp at all against Caroline have been much better with his reeds and knowing what's coming at him in this one right there down in 20 from the 15 and he's Corral and take it down at the 20yard line with two minutes to go in the third quarter and the Giants ready to get the ball back so the Cowboys on that drive did what they did against Carolina which is sort of self destruct you know they didn't give themselves an opportunity they had a little something going a couple of penalties and now the Giants have a chance to get some momentum going they need it desperately here's this a team that's scored one touchdown now and effectively what seven quarters that was on a 68 yard run right his Joneses kick warfield at the 33yard and taken down is Beckham as he goes back to take the punt short return since this stadium open you would think the Cowboys would have a homefield advantage they don't there are only two over 500 there are 11 over 500 on the road and a one of two NFL teams better on the road since 2009 the other being the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and back then Buccaneers whole state of Florida who faded right throw into Bengals this was something I look at Odell Beckham catches but you just don't see this how much trust he has in those hands with somebody bearing down on him it's pretty amazing so Shermer looking for a big play and he sends them the 13 back just good and Berkeley space to the outside for a pickup up a couple Shotley up there to make that play it was not shot Lee's best effort hits Carolina either but the difference when shot Lee is in the game they're winning record and when he's not in the game is just remarkable but he has the sort of speed to be able to batch the sake want Barkley get out there make that money Lee an eighth grade linebacker but in his career he is yet to play all 16 games in the season yeah mr. about a third of city second and nine final minute of the period boys are equal to the test you know you look at this defense person you think about Randy Gregory is not playing the officer spended Gregory but he's at tonight because of a concussion sustained last week and they're going to get David Irving who's a monster and he's happy to the substance abuse violation they'll get him back for week five day Tom Jones is about ready to come back as well so the DEP there now I've got to say one of the things I've really been startled with is there's been some obvious man coverage guys down in the box and they've continued to run the football it's almost any time I saw that against my best wide receiver Odell Beckham throwing it I just don't think anybody can cover into 3:13 3 down to Sunday Night Football resumes right after these messages Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya Sunday Night Football let's take a look at Oakdale Becca yeah one of the best players in the National Football League and with that little slant tyrant Jones made a great playing coverage on him their help underneath was the linebacker so there have been a few where they just had not been able to get him jumpstarted third and nine as we start the fourth quarter from the New York 37 yard line manage a stand that six sets of Manning tonight Tyrone Crawford came around the great circle need to second six SEC's of Manning tonight none for the Giants well it's going to start on the other side because you're gonna get a stunt inside of flowers so now Eli sees that and it gave time for the big looping stunts of Tyrone Crawford to come all the way around the top and I think Eli Manning has got to be watching a little bit of what's going on in front of it because it sexpun prediction the first flag is strong and he's down in the 28 yard line get the call from John Perry before the Cowboys come back out on to the field where they are looking for answers on that giant sideline aren't they same answers that Dallas was looking for coming into this game oh my goodness you know this was an offense really built during the return illegal block in the back return team number 31 10yard penalty first and tenth cowboy ball we're back in 30 seconds I've seen things I shouldn't have unnatural things these people they don't sleep like ever they revel in extremes and the five limitations these pursuits may seem unnecessary but the scariest thing I can imagine is a world where this doesn't exist last week it was Prescott in Carolina who was sacked 6times tonight it's Eli Manning here four hits two knockdowns one batted bull and the biggest said he took tonight was on that oneyard run opponent here's Ezekiel Elliott taking it to the 20yard line for a short game now it's a you know and I think that that's what these two teams are going to be based on what we've seen the first two weeks I mean this really was a one big shot on the part of the Cowboys early on two Tavon Austin and since then it has just been a defensive struggle not a lot of offense to speak of two running backs making people miss but they can't generate enough in the passing game to scare since then is for six to three the Austin catch and run Harrison makes the tackle go back early on Jason Garrett said we have to start fast we'd have to take shots and he was Prescott was seven man protection going back to past a minute that happened in the game and there was Austin to the end zone 64 yards and the only touchdown of the night third and eight now 12 out of 20 127 yards so more than half the yardage Northcrest got the night on that one is easily to make the tax and forward progress gives him a first down up a third and eight could you hear all that conversation going on up there dak Prescott knew what was coming there were two Blitzers to his right and you could hear him say you go left you go left I think he was talking to Joe Looney right here and going listen we don't have that picked up you go left we'll pick it up and because they were able to pick it up because of the fact that dak Prescott knew exactly what he was still good to use dropping from a 30yard line we caught at the 46 yard line that is Tavon Austin coming back to make the gram in a first down for Dallas this time the safety doesn't come over to help and beat up your webs going to have to handle one on one team on Austin and all that speed double move now come out of it anticipated throw that's nicely done on the part of dak Prescott and Tavon Austin I think that's going to be the game now they're going to go out there let's take a look who's playing against Webb if they're oneonone with no help we're going there no gain on the play second down and long for the Cowboys now here it comes this is when the game starts getting interesting now you have Landon Collins one of the best players in the league right down there and there's no way in the world Terrence Williams going to be able to block him so now what you're doing defensively for the New York Giants and say hey we understand we got to make a play on defense now to get back in this game so they're going to start taking some chances first thing that comes into the backfield of Frank Prescott sends him in motion looks that way to the 50yard line and that's galloped the intended receiver and gallop is there to make the catch the rookie out of Colorado State picked in the third round it's all it is once they see the oneonone on the outside again speed up your web the backup corner it really excuse me it really doesn't matter who the offensive player is over there I think they have sort of an equal trust of all these receivers I don't think they love anybody but they haven't enough trust and all of them and if they get that oneonone matchup they're going to take seven different goodies and the Fresco's cashews tonight throws into traffic and the catches that we made by easily but it looks to be a little short of the first down to Norris Jenkins 7 Cole his name tonight with the coverage the ball we spotted right at the 45 yard line and it's going to be a little short of the first down over a tree with the Blitz there here we go this is the kind of play Boettcher desperately needs so I asked a goethe 2/4 and once earlier Prescott will take it himself and easily on the sneak move the sticks first out of the 43 yard line if your have a decision to make on a quarterback snake right there they should have stunted down inside like we saw earlier in the game this is just a gimme on a quarterback sneak you got your best offensive lineman up there and Zack Martin you're going to go that way I think the Giants probably anticipated they just didn't get the stun inside big hope on a quarterback sitting right there seen there's a head tonight right he'll I have one too burst through gets into the second level inside the 30th taken up from behind at the 25yard line by Curtis Riley gain of 19 for him breaks out of a Collins tackle first down well they know what's coming but what are they gonna do they're gonna run blitz at this point now Alec Ogletree tries to fly through there but the Giants were in the same gap they can't do that and messing it up excuse me Dalvin Tomlinson was in the same exact gap as the blitzing Ogletree so a mistake on the defensive side Ruska keeps it himself lot of space nine yard gain second down one Collins makes the tackle for Prescott tonight he has carried the ball with great effectiveness five carries for 38 yards there is just a comfort level whenever they do this here we going to come right hard inside that's the read you see Martin do that and it could not be easier for deck Prescott he is now showing the full complement of his skills and some of it intellectual skills like we did on that one pass second a one it'll be at first down and that will take some more time off huge for the Giants here to not give up a touchdown a touchdown turns it into a threepossession game total do a field goal at least it's a two position game for what it's worth at this point twelve play coming on this Drive my man has taken a beating out there tonight he's looking for one more shot we've seen him do some magical things in this stadium but morbid right now Charlie 52 to 640 to go in regulation going for six and then almost picked off intended for Beasley not they Dion who's back there second year guy had a Boise State to bust it up at three second down and ten that's a tough cover right there and really well done by Dante Dion you're gonna get the crossing route going like that and sometimes you just had to run over the top of that big plane and almost make an interception that might have turned his game around 13th play balanced drive so far six run six passes started back at the Dallas team and is consumed over six minutes two yards shy of the first time third down now 46 ground yards for Prescott tonight that time dick Prescott got pulled watch what cream Martin does to him takes a step down and then comes back but then it's just the physical skills of dak Prescott running the football able to make a play so the Giants won but then dak Prescott made of lose their earned in two lesson six apply 14 plays 82 yards and eight and a half minutes that seeks mom right there when we closer to Thanksgiving he haven't been right into the Salvation Army barrel there's nothing better as an offensive team when you start to feel the other side lose their legs just a little bit when you can tell that our big offensive line can start to take over our stud running back can start to take over but that drive in my estimation belong to dak Prescott some of the things he did mentally some of the things he did physically some of the reads he made firstclass drive by dak Prescott modern to try to make it a 17point lead a threepossession lead with less than six minutes to play and the Cowboys right now trying to get to one and one they'd be in a tie for first place in the division would Philadelphia and a Washington back then Zeke long long drive with a touchdown fourth Dallas on top twenty two three and Mar to kickoff Cowboys 300 yards tonight and the Giants exactly half of that 150 the Giants begin this next drive from the 25 after this flemeth Giants offensive line visited engine 33 firehouse in the Bowery sanjaya famous happy tonight that man is not how hooker is the Giants offensive line coach he's watched his boys give up six sacks tonight here too and I scream at a first down before he's taken down stayed inbounds pop continues to run leave and arrest makes to stop well if you're looking for any good news for the New York Giants it's not like they're getting beat physically you know what we've seen is that they're just not used to playing together enough to pick up some of these stunts the Cowboys have laid on outside for a short game Razer takes them out makes the catch second look it has been the stunts of the Dallas Cowboys that is just this offensive line that time Shane Smith blew the protection this time Marcus warrants can come in untouched they don't switch off there and then once again a free runner so nobody beat with just beaten by scape Cowboys jump off neutral infraction defense number 97 fiveyard penalty second down it's not code Charlton we check in with Michelle again all we saw Giants Energon jalapeño carted off the field earlier he is out with a right lower leg injury DeMarcus Lawrence is back out there after going in for an IV and sharply is being held out for precautionary reasons I'm told he tweaked his right hamstring and they're just not going to put him back in right now mm yeah of course it was Sean the whole thing is can he stay healthy second down and three the coverage is great Lattimore you know we started the game Chris mentioned you know how the Cowboys were an enigma and I think I go back to the game we did the preseason game against Arizona my feeling is you know they have to run the ball and of course they have the guy to do it and the defense I think is I don't want to say underrated but I think the defense is going to be the telltale thing for the Cowboys D'Souza's let me tell you what I think the defense is good and there's a few reasons for that one of them has been Byron Jones since being converted to the cornerback position I'm really surprised that he's been as effective this early as he has been it's been used to plan those big tight ends and now he's covering bigger wide receivers in itself that's up it's caught 40 yard line that's Beckham for Odell Beckham tonight that's only his third catch they've done a masterful job taking him pretty much out of the game yeah and when they rush for which they do their this offensive line does alright Eli steps up though Doyle has time to put a little move on down the field but that hasn't been the case sneaky from the 40 barclays but the Cowboys have a great fun 7 the secondary looking real good you talking about you know how good Jones has been and I go I go back to the fact if Gregory can stay straight and they get herbing back I mean those are two studs two more studs on the defense they absolutely are in these new techniques being taught by Christmas chard has made Manning second five growers in this part but it won't be a first down Berkeley makes the tax even going to him a ton denied he's been their top receiver but not much yardage it's 11 receptions for 58 yards he's carried the ball 10 times tonight but for only 2 point 7 yards per tote 27 yards overall yeah and this offensive line is just not good enough to play and protect without a running game ago three minutes you know one of the things that Chris Rashard is brought over from Seattle is a real understanding of what these corner bags have to cover basically their responsibility is to not let anybody get over the top of them they don't have to worry so much when there's an in breaking cut something in the middle of field there's somebody there so by simplifying the responsibilities it has really helped these corners cover one round paid down the sideline or the comebacks off us the catch things away except the first down but that's going to take us almost to the twominute warning the indirection makes the tackle well the good news is van der ash is getting some experience because of the fact Shawn Lee is not in there they're going to need them twominute warning the Cowboys on their way to a victory in the home opener in Arlington he's seven but they lose San Francisco 32:27 first a 19 yard line Beckerman incomplete covered well there by UGA second down and ten they have been brilliant tonight these corner backs covering the deep route remember that is their primary assignment and they've been brilliant doing it on both sides talked a little bit about Byron Jones but a woojae on the other side against the speed of Odell Beckham all over it Cowboys next week we'll be playing in Seattle and the Giants will walks across Texas and play in Houston come on Shawn second attack delay again you play game offense fiveyard penalty second down this is one of the fastest games I can ever remember it's not even 10 o'clock in the central time zone the game started what's not Freddy 722 kinda what the league had in mind yeah well not this for Aspen I'll take and not this score don't throw fat flags it goes fast except the penalties in the game second and 15 down at the 18yard land also no challenges yeah the reviews I'd say we've talked a lot about different people but Jaylon Smith coming back healthy from that drop foot that he had a season ago and one thing that's really surprised me uhoh looks like Lee Collins quick time out back after this swag and postgame report coming up right after the game Michelle on the field stars of the game Lea McHugh is here to wrap it up Peter Kings football morning in America preview Chris and I will take a look ahead to next Sunday's match up between the patch and Detroit up right after the game friendly at the 918 carries for 79 yards just been workman light tonight by the Dallas Cowboys they did what they need to get the big play early we worked together so long it's the exact word that right there you go sake one Barclay who came out holding his hands back to the right and then to the endzone wide open is Ingram for the touchdown no giant receiver has been close to me in that open tonight so it becomes with an extra point pending 10point game and the Giants sloping Rose will onside kick it with almost certainty we'll see what happens crazier stuff has happened in the NFL already two weeks gross us to make it 2210 well this is one of those oops kind of plays if you're playing defense it's either Jaylon Smith or Jeff Heath one of us two of them have to come up with this deep / round here and nobody did it was almost bizarre they played so well all night and it just see a completely blown coverage at the end of the game luckily for Eli Manning DeMarcus Lawrence didn't believe the deal there against flowers with that bull rush if he liked credit despite all the hits he's taken his eyes were down the field he found his band a minute 27 if the Giants can somehow get the ball back on the onside kick they have all of their timeouts the hands team is out there the good hands folks for the Cowboys hooting Elliott at the bottom of the screen that's all that's loose and the Giants think they have it for Perry's call one of the other officials in indeed they do New York Giants Michael Thomas number 31 is the guy as the kick was in and out of the hands of the tight end Blake Darwin and the Giants have a little bit of life left yeah just put a little pace on this thing and I mean you've ever tried to catch a football bouncing like that you know it's nearly impossible that Michael Thomas came up with it so who knows that would get into one of those situations right you can take the field goal first unto the receiving team the clock should have started and then stopped on the recovery please reset the game clock to 1 to 5 what would they five remaining please two seconds for what it's worth obviously you have to get another one you've got to get some score here it doesn't matter which touchdown or field going to try one more of those things and launch a few Hail Mary and see what happens the first chefs block or us eli sometime you got three receivers split to the left Beckham right there seven targets tonight Rose it's caught 50yard line goes everyone it took six seconds and makes it second down and six from New York I think that'll be the strategy assuming they can get down somewhere close to the 30yard line and probably just take the field goal go again and then start throwing Hail Marys at the back the end zone and see what happens that score as quickly as you can in second the seven four man rush over the middle that's caught spinning away his Shepherd but he can't get the first and I'm the Giants have warmed their timeouts time is awastin here on third down two freeze and Tampa to defense on the part of the that's all aged and as the past is caught inside the 40yard line by Ingram that's a first down of the Giants take their first timeout with 46 seconds so they can move it maybe I would say 10 12 yards I would think you bring the field goal group it at that point I mean right now you get an attempt to 55 yarder but that's not the right move to make right and Rose sauce is career long 52 so you definitely need another 10 something like that let's go to Michelle well Rose has converted a 63yard or in pregame I asked him what his range was tonight he said you know I really don't put a number on it but I can tell you this I love kicking inside this building I love this building it feels great the leg feels great he is 230 pounds and he has a gigantic luck protection going for six into the ends is intercepted for the moment but then out of bounds was Jeff Heath and Heath is down he is hurt so he came down with the ball but he was out of bounds and it will be second down in ten and he will most likely have to come out as he tries to get back to the defensive um this is the eeriest of all throws for wide receivers because you're going down and you're running in the triple coverage and you're also running at the goal post so when this ball is a little long and you're jumping for it you don't know if a person's gonna hit you the goal post is going to hit you but somebody is going to hit you it's a really pretty play on the part of Jeff Heath and he came down into the back Beckham will draw a crowd the Cowboys charged with the timeout injury inside two minutes and Heath is gonna have to come out of the game never have Campbell will come in to spell him there also a safety Xavier woods we got hurt and preseason another key part of that defense who will eventually come back and make them even tougher second down and ten stop the clock there shortgame 33 seconds inna 3 to be third down and 7 now you're looking at a fountain of 51yard field goal so you make the argument either way here you either go okay I'm in field goal range let's go ahead and take one more shot at the end zone see what happens or I need another five yards to make this field goal it's 14 receptions tonight for partly third and seven beef is back in originally out of bounds in if it's stopped 23 seconds and now you break the field goal group in try another onside kick and a Hail Mary and that's the giant strategy pure and simple maybe not so pure and not so well maybe not you know I mean it doesn't matter you have to have it both ways so but with only 22 seconds to go in the clock maybe you want to take one shot in the endzone or two whatever it is you've got to leave at least one time assuming you're going to recover the next one and to be able to take the shot look I said pure and not so simple see where they're gonna do here on the field you're looking at a 38 yard field goal attempt from this buy one time and that took seven seconds off the clock the shepherd was the intended receiver you know if Shepherd could have stayed in bounds on this play and fought directly back for the football because Byron Jones had his back turned he would have gotten the pass interference call here he just didn't work hard enough to get back into play he's right there Jones's head to just turn and run right back in to Jones you're gonna get a ball into one your clock now you've got row size for a 38 yard attempt to try to make it a seven point game nice one there by Dixon so you've got 11 seconds and what the Giants would have to do is obviously recover the onside kick throw a Hail Mary or whathaveyou and try to tie it up well you know the hard part here is if the onside kick is just at ten yards that is a long Hail Mary to have to make because this clock is going to run so you almost need one of those big sort of bouncers and hope that you get out beyond the 50yard line to make that Hail Mary a little bit easier because you may only get one shot at it but maybe you don't need a Hail Mary Pat Shermer knows that all too well bees in Minnesota last year seven heaven right at the end of the game with digs to beat in New Orleans stayed inbounds ran it into the end zone senator the championship game the heavens only pass out one of those for lifetime probably and probably all right let's see what we got going here they got Shawn lien so they took him out initially now he's in the game he's exactly where they kicked it last time blake jar wa rose sauce is going to kick that one out about take care of that kickoff outofbounds kicking team by rule I'll be placed in the 40yard line first content and that will that will do it for the New York Giants tonight you like hung in there he did credit he hung in there pretty tough tonight he's going to be hurting tomorrow but I think the Dallas Cowboys have their identity now they are what they are which is a defensive football team pretty well and then Dec is going to have to be the complete quarterback not only throwing the ball playaction but him running the ball his ones tonight were really a key part of this offense getting going they are who we thought they were yeah it's sort of kind of go to Dennis green well that's going to do it as the Dallas Cowboys after their loss last week come home win go to Seattle next week and the Giants will go to Houston to take on the on to Texas in Houston next week final score is 20 to 13 Dallas coming up next about Roy after these mess
