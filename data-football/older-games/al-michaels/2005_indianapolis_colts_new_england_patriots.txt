============================================================

there are many expressions in the world of sport some colorful others charmingly poignant there's only one that sounds comically benign yet has the power to crush men's souls that expression getting over the hump is that team that big gain but usually that player that stands between you and the ultimate achievement of your sport Williams at his DiMaggio Ewing Berkeley and Milan all Jordan now manning has his brady try as he might peyton manning this offspring of an NFL legend cannot be a late round draft choice out of michigan that is a hop a while peyton manning struggles Tom Brady's only struggle is to find a watch to go with all three of his championship rings you have the contract the shoe deal the video game but the hump it doesn't care touchdown record means nothing to the hop MVPs so what that hump will ride you and ride you until your dance is done there's the road to the championship go through New England Championships a paladin so what's the paper gonna do to me he's

life pumps they aren't easy they were you wouldn't be watching coach versus Patriots Manny versus Brady are you indeed about 30 miles south of Boston and maybe 20 miles north of Providence Rhode Island the town of Fox much stadium voice this big crowd as we get set for Peyton man and the Indianapolis Colts against Tom Brady New England Patriots on Monday Night Football now Michaels with John Madden with Sam Ryan welcome to Foxborough when the schedule came out last spring of his circled one game as mustsee this was the game tremendous buzz around that rightfully so the Colts come in seven and oh the only undefeated team in the league and now they have a good defense to go with Peyton Manning and their offense meanwhile the New England Patriots decimated by injuries especially defensively and thus they have won one wasallam all the way through the season four wins three losses they try to win for the second time in a row for the first time this season everybody talking about is Dennis Quaid put it in the t's a hump game for Indianapolis meanwhile for New England a very important game in terms of the standings and so John it begs the question that's been asked all week long you get the final word here is this a more important game for Indianapolis or New England in Apple's I mean this is this is one of those games you know how they say if you're going to be the man you have to beat the man if you're going to be the team you have to beat the team and I think what the Colts are doing this year and I think they're on their way to something big to something special but if they're going to get there they have to be able to beat the Patriots and your favorite here in Foxborough tonight the game can play out so many different ways with Dungey against Belichick how do you see this game playing out tonight every time the Patriots play the Colts what they do is they say we are going to be more physical than you you're a finesse team we're a physical team they double the wide receivers they bang the inside receivers they play the run with seven that's a template that's the way they've beaten them that's what they think they'll do tonight season at the halfway mark a little beyond what better way to wrap up week nine and the Colts grading in the Patriots on Monday Night Football now the McDonald's quarterback comparison the coast Peyton Manning was the NFL's number one overall draft choice in 1998 and tonight starts his 120th consecutive game Tom Brady came into the league two years after Manning as a sixthround choice and is trying to become the first quarterback to win three straight Super Bowls the visa Skycam providing the pictures at no other camera can by bringing you into the action and tracking on are those tonight the great defensive ends of the coach white greenie and the comeback King Tedy Bruschi on Monday Night Football the patch man this is darling the line for a showdown tonight come on ABC sports home of Super Bowl xlviii you to the home we're the seventh night of November will take us clear skies the temperature which got up to into the upper 50s in the Boston area today is now down to 47 but the winds have died down they were gusting at about 30 earlier today but very little factor right now and Peyton Manning ready to go to work and this has been for Peyton Manning this stadium and the one that used to be across the parking lot old Foxboro Stadium thousands of para he's never won here close his back to run the kickback Adam Vinatieri to put it in the air and the most anticipated game of the regular season to this point is underway in Foxborough roads from the 10:00 all the way out to the 45 yard line and Peyton Manning and the Colts will take over at that spot take max Tennessee Volunteers Eddie James you graduate the you department at Syracuse Brian Fletcher UCLA Dallas Clark University of Iowa when cap Ryan Lilja Kansas State Jeff Saturday UNC Chuck Scott I don't Brian Dean Northern Illinois after a 37yard returned the bolt is at the 46 in the first play from scrimmage tonight his Edgerrin James and they'll wrap him scrimmage that's a loss of to Mike Vrabel the inside linebacker in for the stop to make it second down as well you know this is a big play for the Colts and entering James it's a sprint play he's going to run it right out here and try and get to the numbers now what the goats are doing is they're going to play a hard edge another look when he smarts that way get upfield and make him make a decision before he gets to the numbers don't snow in that huddle as they almost always do loss of three second and 13 Manning out of his shotgun waving away too going deep downfield and it will be taken in by Marvin Harrison inside the ten so Peyton Manning on second down stepping to his right out of the shotgun and a 48 yard pass and that silences this big crowd immediately ran Asante Samuel is number 22 on ermine and that is tough to cover Marvin Harrison all over the field he's expecting him to stay outside though when he goes into the post he gets about three steps on Samuel it is a beatenup banged up injury completed secondary from the Whalen they are very available back there as they showed on f4 that Manning goes to the airway the now Edgerrin James takes the ball inside the 5yard line Samuel comes up to make the tackle Marvin Harrison throwing the block during the regular season as you take a look at that against the Patriots two and eight is Peyton Manning and of course all on two in postseason in the last two years they've been very effective down here in this area mostly running the ball a year ago in the year before that it was a lot of playaction pass and here and this is zzz not getting to the endzone Edgerrin James having another banner season is averaging four point nine yards per carry coming into the game and Willie McGinest makes the tackle setting up a third and goal to Tony Dungy Indianapolis Colts I know what Tony Dungy is thinking right now this is exactly what I wanted he said when we play these guys we never have the lead and he gets to the line quickly you can see the Patriots and they have to call it sign up you see so Randle gay coming in going off they need to get said so Indianapolis horses Bill Belichick to take an early timeout so Indianapolis trying to cash in on its first drive they first in all six regularseason these both postseason games from 2000 on now it's third down and goal from the one yard line James the running back Manning as he's thrown to do boiling across the line a lot of gesticulating and now a quick drop on a fade to Harrison &amp; Harrison is able to make the catch for the touchdown oneonone with a southeast Samuel Indianapolis strikes first you know the way the Colts call their plays he has two runs down there in one pass now anytime that he finds tight coverage mantoman out here on Marvin Harrison he is going to try and get him the ball because Marvin Harrison will win those battles so he looks out there he had a run call he checked out of the run saw plate coverage mantoman on Marvin Harrison and that's where he went Mike Vanderjagt for the point after put it down so a perfect beginning for the Indianapolis Colts after James loses three on the first play the long pass to Harrison and Tony Dungy team into the end zone two and a half minutes into the game the Colts on top in New England seven to nothing Indianapolis on top seven to nothing Dominique Rose helping to set it up with a 37 yard return of the open and kick and of course we saw a Manning and Harrison established a record a couple of weeks ago in Indianapolis on a Monday night quarterback receiver combination they Raynor the it's a short gift it's filled with to the 31 any moved so quickly that you don't have time to go back and dissect everything but John let's go back and take a look at that long pass to Harrison well here's Marvin Harrison he's going to run the post then you always say on a post what happened to the safety Eugene Wilson here will you see Dallas quark also runs a post he comes with that post Marvin Harrison comes in behind them both Dallas Clark and Harrison are about the same point he sue and Clark runs that post that takes the safety out of there and opens up the post for the middle for Marvin Harrison for difference strong safety starters the season for New England the injuries defensively especially in the secondary for the first time in Corey Dillon on a tender ankle picks up about four here is the Patriot offense Tom Brady mission Cory Villa the University of Washington Deion Branch University of Louisville David Givens is Notre Dame Daniel Graham the University of Colorado Benjamin Watson the University of Georgia in their Qasr the University of Toledo Logan minkins Fresno State Dan Cobin Boston College Stephen nail Cal State Bakersfield Tom Ashworth Colorado tagger and Mankins the left hacker on left guard are rookies to be a first down his favorite receiver is beyond branch the MVP of the Super Bowl last year Brady during the regular season against the Colts for no and in post season of course he's knocked them out in the last two seasons so he's been perfect against Indianapolis this isn't he the calmest coolest thing you've ever seen in a pocket since Joe Montana the Super Bowl rings his team time to become the first to win two straight super those identity of this unit back pass back to Dillon and Corey Dillon who had missed the game and then last week Patrick pass was their running back and it's possible that Dillon would have played very little maybe not at all had passed luck got into hurt last week hamstring ball in the second quarter this is an organized play I saw him practice this the other day where they pitch it one way and then cut back you usually cut back off a handoff not a pitch out this is a play where they pitch like they're going outside to the left and then cut right back to the right Dillon is a tough guy when he has a bad ankle didn't think as you said he could play last week and they got in a situation where he had to play gutted it out again I watched him the other day in practice and he just gutted out practice and and if the Patriots are going to be able to run the ball tonight it has to be Corey Dillon last week as you seen he came into the second quarter he scored both touchdowns was in jeopardy dropping under 500 they were down by the Buffalo first in 10 the borders of the Colt 46 wrong one but this time there's no gain Harper makes the tackle first guy to hit him here's the indie defense McCain Brock and something Corey Simon Florida State University Monta record Texas Tech Hawaii Freddy Syracuse David Thornton North Carolina area bracket Rutgers kennel June Michigan Nick hawk Fort Valley State Mike dogs the Ohio State University Bob Sanders Island Jason Dave Washington State NATO June the linebacker five interceptions this season he's won two of them back the touchdown the little swing pass Dylan my size step there to pick up a first ounce of Corey Dillon a little swing pass along handed nice little cheap move and a first down on a 16yard pickup you know one of the things you have to do when you have a good pass rusher like Dwight Freeney you have to try and get outside of them you can get outside of them what runs you can get outside them with spring passes or you can cut him get his hands down and just throw a loop pass like they did to Corey Dillon on that play as you said he made a heck of a catch onehanded and then right after that catch made a very good move and he needs a breather right now they are really short at running back so Brady will spread it out here and work out of the shotgun by Troy brown when you look at their running backs Patrick passes hurt Kevin Faulk is pert so they went on got my cloud off the street he played with the Giants and preseason and last year and picked up a fullback heat Evans is look at Mike cloud who played his college ball at Boston College the cloud will see his first action as a patriot at this season as Dylan gets a rest Heath Evans coming over he's the only other running back fullback who came from the Dolphins and I think if you ever get in a bind that they really don't have a running back when running game they'll go to that formation we just saw on that last play empty backfield receiver but his tackle back of the line of scrimmage well back of the line of scrimmage Robert Mathis a pass rush specialist who has eight sacks this season first got a breakthrough day and he's really been something special as you said Ali he has eight sacks and then five fumbles on those sacks so so he not is only a sack diving he's a striptease soccer and when you have him on one side and free me on the other side you have some pass protection problems especially in downs like at least once thankful Matheson utterly game this season and you'll be tackling the 22 yard line about two yards short of the first down so you have a fourth down coming up crowd already imploring Belichick to go for it will be fourth down is 2 to 22 and he is going to go for it let's great free me here when you know you're going to get double then don't go where they're going to W he doesn't eat as a stunt and goes all the other side well it's not close to the one one and a half as the boys who conceive just outside the 21 yard line so at least they're gonna line up to go for a drop Corey Dillon back in and they will go for it a quick slam as we missed David Gibbons for a first down that say it Tom Brady loves to throw this and he can throw it as quickly as anyone all you have to do is get us in it get just get inside right there right the minute that he gets in or the split second thing he gets inside that corner Tom Brady's gonna give him the ball five different receivers ready for the Patriots at the 16 yard line first you know John I'm thinking about that call by Belichick and what it means and to me partially it means he says you know what this is gonna be a highscoring game I'm gonna need a lot of points tonight right we're it's going to be a shootout and if it's going to be a shootout let's get started in the first quarter and the other thing that means to me is the confidence in Tom Brady if if he's really your best player and then you you get a fourth down you need a first down why not put it in your best players hands and baby gets it then is not split to the left in the South Glen stated that Corey outside five receivers all running patterns lady steps away from the pressure across route touchdown Deion Branch that's a pretty good way theme of the year to start ok you can't beat this start it see I'm French is he's the inside receiver there and he just runs a corner pattern you start in like you're going to the post and then you go back to the corner but you better get white friend blocked and they know that but because they do here they get him and then and then he starts on the spot they just let him go and just push him right by on the play vana Terry ties the game 16yard touchdown gravy on the 64 64 60 yards and a key four thousand version the lesson six to play in the period seven seven Sports Illustrated this week previewing tonight's game and there they were on the cover Manning and and Brady about three weeks ago Dwight Freeney was on the cover of Sports Illustrated saluting the Colts muchimproved defense and the Ghul begins tonight with each guy throwing a touchdown pass kick wash he is that the two by Dominique groans you got here on his first run back and this one pretty good as well as he brings it back out to the 33 yard line Tom war was some lastminute concepts for Peyton Manning as he comes out onto the field 77 bill belichick now in his sixth season as the Patriots head coach fastest touched on his teams have given up and only took you 30 from Manning to get him down the field now India the walk of the second time alone that stuff's going to change to the five yards per carry and this is good for about six behind Glenn and Lilja on the left side Edgerrin James you know Tom Moore is trying to check out the way they played two tight ends the first time the Colts had the ball they used all two tight ends this time they start this series with three wide receivers and then and then what the Patriots did they went to nickel five defensive backs being receivers here that's Stokely even play on the side second down and three they went a stretch to the right side James picks up a first down quickly the New England defense take Savannah 5th World War mom and her job is green dalsu Willie McGinest University of Southern Cal Tedy Bruschi Arizona Mike Vrabel the Ohio State University look over through University they've been since floor around the blue gate Elysee Eugene Wilson Illinois University of Maine Rodney Harrison gone for the season Richard Seymour again he was an active attacker came in a row the right side and that pass is knocked away by Asante Samuel Samuel and Harrison locking up again in this time it's a Samuel able to knock it down to make it second down there are such a man who was going to play safety for thee for the Patriots and it's Randall Gaye play in there tonight that's Asante Samuel he gets him turned to something Samuels even to come out of it no turn and then get back and get back to that ball first then completion of the game double slot here second down and 10 James is the wrong Bannock the fake you off play action gets it to James and he's going to get a wrappedup stop first by Vince Wilfork and the flag comes in for the first time in the game so we played over ten minutes without a penalty and now Bernie Cooper will make his presence known yeah we always talk about that but that really impresses me when a nose tackle makes a tackle on the screen pass and that means that you're turning and running back do you see a facts rush you start to start to rush the passer and then you feel screen and you stop your pass run the minute he starts up field then he felt or saw screen he ran right down the line of scrimmage pennilyn Tariq when it's the 325pound knows that moon will fork the number one pick in 2004 third and 13 proudest spirited crowd is standing Manning out of a shotgun thought we're his forward progress is the question Reggie Wayne makes the catch but his forward progress does not met him a first doubt he had to come back to get the ball unless it's not a first down it's at the New England 46 yard line fourth down and you're gonna see the line is going to be in there you see Reggie Wayne he started he he was about three three yards beyond the line but then to get open he had to work back now you can't say that you know he should have stayed up he should have got the first down he had to work back to get open to catch the ball but they will at least line up to go for it they quickly come to the line of scrimmage the day passes down the two one and that Manning is going to take a timeout and they figure they get the funding goofin will sit 7/7 is the story that be live in the periods to Philadelphia next Monday night the Dallas Cowboys to multiply week against shunned and he gets banished the browse against after a sign out Tony line up to go for on fourth down and one big big gamble if they snap it here they have called the timeout New England game of iluminage or the courtyard this is near midfield will a snap and James appears to have it as he spins his way for a first down James in his career has picked up a first down on fourth and one about two thirds of the time so a big big gamble for Dungey and Indianapolis is able to move the chains and he has a fullback in front of them and James mungro and you're gonna see number 23 just lead him right through the hole he doesn't block anyone but he kind of leaves it open for him a little I think that answers the question really Alvin I think both coaches have to feel that this is a shoot out now that it's gonna be a shootout and if that's the way it's going to end up let's start it that way and they've proven it first contain 44 fake inside game and then James Hayes in the block Magee is incomplete dallas/fort the tight end going down the sidelines it'll be second down and ten one of the things that the that the Colts are thinking tonight is they want to they want to spread spread Dallas Clark out a little you know usually they keep them in tighter when they keep them in tight then that then that strong side linebacker like McGinnis like he is right here will jam them to get him away from the jam they're gonna split him a little second down and ten from the 44 yard line the outside goes and James picks up about yards on the play it'll be third and short Randall gay the safety comes up to make the hit one of the things that we're talking about Tedy Bruschi the other day on this play right here the stretch they have to set the edge in other words the edge is right here you have to get up here so that he can't get outside they didn't get the edge set up hard and then and then Edwin James was able to get outside of him Gordon a deuce two minutes to play in a very spirited open fought by Wayne first down Reggie Wayne to the 29 yard line oh it's now Harrison I was just gonna say I was down on the field tonight when Peyton Manning come out and I've I've seen Bateman and come out on a lot of fields before a lot of games and as a competitor has always been focused I have never ever seen him like he was tonight you know at some point I mean he's a great competitor and I know that he's starting to take this stuff personally of the Brady Peyton Manning the well you can't beat the Patriots this guy is as focused as a guy can be the man he wants to put a lot of that to rest there's no question because Manning a tremendous start to his career obviously false start here zone number Z in 49 touchdown passes last year it's a Hall of Fame start to a tremendous career the royal family of course with father Archie and brother Eli playing very well but the hope the whole thing with Manning becomes how come you can beat New England and he doesn't want to hear why can't you win Boston 15plus down he's many people he's going to step out of bounds at about the 25 yard line he was chased that time from behind by Taiwan the defensive end to illustrate 119 previous starts in his career he's won 61 percent of the time 73 and 46 but there it is and eight against the Patriots and as I said I mean he has so much pride he's such a great player and such a great competitor he doesn't want to hear this thing and the only way to not second down and seven at the 26yard line about the 21 on what should be the final play of the period the teams will change ends here as the seconds tick down but a good crisp we played at dude first quarter Brady threw a touchdown pass Manning threw a touchdown pass and we played 15 minutes in Foxborough with the store Indianapolis seven New England seven and Monday Night Football resumes after this message and a word for ABC station back we come to Foxborough Massachusetts Al Michaels John Madden and Sam Ryan week 9 of the NFL season concluding good first quarter seven seven it's third down and two here this is a 12play of the Pope's drive Dallas Clark that tight end is in the backfield right Patriots here in a33 nipple comes out of the backfield makes the catch and has the first down before he's hit by Asante Samuel if you give Peyton Manning anything he's going to find it did you said he had three wide receivers he looks at the coverage he has Dallas Clark right next to him Clark fakes like he's going to block goes out there runs just enough pattern to get a first down and he's lucky he held on to that thing I mean Asante Samuel really leveled them his first catch of the night 17th of the season taken down tie worn is the first to hit him different from Manning I you take a look at this as James just carried four mm time in his career you know you've got maybe the most cerebral quarterback against the defensive genius and Belichick back and forth we'll go all night long and those are great matchups something that legal one is going to give anyone and as bill gulshat says if you ever leave anything open anyone think he's going to find it that's why you don't see many teams which peyton manning he'll get you Wayne makes the kacct ball juggled for the moment but he holds on very close to a first down Dwayne Starks 8 year out of the University of Miami makes the tackle and he's kind of a bowline guy here in New England and if you're going to work on any of their defensive backs it's Duane starts and and one thing that they've been able to do is to be a very physical defense that these corners aren't as physical as they used to be and so I could nut myself by telling the media I'm not a physical swimmer they want to forget there's James picking up the first time as he takes it to the fiveyard line and so this is a drive that has consumed almost eight minutes now the Patriots in the red zone this season take a look at that they were very very good in 2003 and four but tied for last with Buffalo right now 70% of the time on the opposition gets inside the 20 they get a touchdown you did Richard Seymour out three more guys defensive back line those two guys they're big red zone guys 16 play of the drive is jeez getting about half the distance to the goal line those spotted near the two we were talking to to Peyton Manning last night and and he was talking about rodney harrison and saying that when ride the Harrison played you always had to have the key him because even though they would play cover to and he would be deep he had he had the ability to the freelance if he was gonna run he'd be updated to run if you're gonna pass he'd be deep against your path the injured the Harrison gone for the year second and goal Jane is gonna pull his leg in for a touchdown so a 17 play drive against the patchwork New England defense we say patchwork with all the things that Belichick has had to do in Eric Mangini and the second drive for Indianapolis tonight results in a second touchdown yeah wetsy watch your right guard right here Jake Scott he's good to get a good block on Tedy Bruschi and they're going to come right in his hole is he makes contact there gets him going gets him to the outside and that gives Edgerrin James the soft spot to get underneath and the Senators gift Saturday went to work and took care of Wilfork Vanderjagt for the point after Indy's had the ball twice for it plays New England one scored once 147 Colts the Indianapolis Colts against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots the championship banners that's winning in 2001 2003 2004 so that's three out of four no teams ever won three consecutive Super Bowls nor four out of five and Robert Kraft is on this team now for 11 years turned the franchise completely around got the stadium built the three Super Bowl wins plus he went to another Super Bowl and they lost the Green Bay in the mid90s with Bill Parcells here you know and this is in an era that we never thought there would be a dominant team there we fought by Bessel Johnson and he brings it out to the 32 so Tom Brady will get the ball for only the second time in the game 11:45 remaining in the half as we look at downtown Boston about 30 miles to the north since 1950 that's the way they would stack up the highest winning percentage were starting quarterback Otto Graham is number one Daryle Lamonica would be two and Tom Brady tonight making his 70th start his 52 and 17 third vest and then in postseason hero always and Parsons and his nine and all a 32yard on first on the outside and that's Dion branch making the catch were picked up of about five Nick Harper makes the tackle so many times you know you get an anticipated game or a great fight that you can't wait for and it just kind of leaves a little flat pretty good beginning tonight this this is a great beginning and the and the crowd was excited as heck and then and then the Colts come and they go down to score and everything quiets down I mean then the fakers took the ball then they go score then the wife comes back into place and then and you know the way things have gone to this point this season John you would think that if no England pulls it off this year this might be the best of those accomplishments considering all of the things that they've had to deal with in the first half of the season yeah I mean if they if they pull it off this year it'll be truly amazing I I felt last year that they were a dominant team I mean you'd see him go from the midpoint on it looked like they were the best team ASE Philadelphia the best team in the NFC I don't feel that way this year about the purple Rock ball the two games last year were already lost three this season lay em on in effect Oh a tight end screen from low gain the line of scrimmage will remain the 36 will be fourth down and in comes the punting unit you know the Patriots really rely on the screen I mean that's it that's a third down a third down screen I've never been a big fan of that but I've never been a big screen guy either now the Patriots will screen I mean you watch them in practice and half their passes or screens they scream to backs the screen the tight ends they scream the wide receivers they screen on third and long on a play like that when they need the left winning ticket descent down Froy Walters would good kid as a 55yard goofy little yard line and their attorneys to the 23yard line Flagg is at the 40yard line of the Colts this has not been a sloppy game either you know we're talking to two Tony Dungy last night and he was talking you know about more penalties this year he said there's more sloppy play this year you know he didn't blame the officials and he kind of blame the you know the players and the coaches for for for sloppy play this has not been a sloppy play game extremely well played to this point and it would figure we see so many special teams penalties here's one here holding 28 during the kick on the spot a possession chain half the distance to the goal first off long injection killed Samuel up but Manning is going to get the ball back and a sevenpoint lead second period and it's a pretty significant one because the ball was bought at the 10yard line returned to the it's taken back from the spot where the ball was fielded so back to the fiveyard line goes indianapolis bursting 10 votes for the third possession and Peyton Manning was like he was away from Center and he was I was talking about the 12th man in the crowd and this is where the that was third and lon and when you're backed up and the end zone is right behind you it is very difficult to hear now Peyton Manning had looked like he forgot the snap count and he called it on two and thought he said one but he was the only guy moving first and 12 now from the Queen Manning James is able to make the juggling act to give them some breathing space after the 9 yard line and Tedy Bruschi is there for the tackle that was a good play by Edgerrin James just keeping it alive because Edgerrin James was the guy that he faked to and usually you just kind of run the play out and Edgar James stayed alive he started running that edge play and then came back in the heck of an adjustment second he says we call base because the comeback King earlier had a mild stroke in the offseason he paid a hole in his home as Gaines gets off here by colvin and it speaks to the Patriots injuries this season the guys they've lost looking at the before defensive backs out for the season Buland Harrison starters and on top of that yeah there's a few missed those six teams before he came back Matt like starting with a co gay is back after missing four games Seymour still missing tonight feed the fence evenso on the defensive side they've been decimated but there is brewski we'll mark of the story of course coming back from what could have been a white jet length in the but wasn't third down and flag as that is caught by Brian Fletcher one of the tight ends momentarily of first and pending the core you know is interesting about that play Ally you don't see the Colts do a lot they state they huddled up so it was one of those things that that you know because they were having a problem communicating Peyton Manning got everyone in the huddle they called to play in the huddle rather than at the line of scrimmage the pans 23 defense that penalty is d fly Wayne's face Wayne Starks hands to the face at the 22 to be a first down here stark sees he's coming up and trying to get the jam now you plank get the jam on his shoulders we got a pretty good jam at that left hand it just went up to the facemask is flawed and that's way more than the outside work work on stocks again and with Marvin Harrison getting so much attention you forget about a guy like Reggie Wayne but he has turned into a very good wide receiver there Peyton Manning was saying last night the Reggie Wayne is his most consistent receiver I think we have a breakdown you know throwing the ball right side and left side they used to be heavy right side and now their balance growing outside right second in inches and James gets those inches in about seven more yards as he takes it out too close to the 39 yard line before he's tackled by the safety Michael stone yeah we can talk about the quarterback of the receivers and the tight ends but this offensive line and this running back are something special too I mean they're really making holes for ED during James and he has holes on the spreads play here he has holes in the cutback they just take that whole left side and collapse it so the Edgerrin James can cut back James has already carried the ball 14 times quarter Fletcher again flexor up to the 45yard line it'll be second down in for Eugene Wilson makes the tackle I think you know we talked about Tony Dungy wanting to get ahead play with the lead I think for this reason now you can keep this Patriot defense offbalance I mean you are you gonna run are you gonna pass and use three wide receivers four wide receivers hey you split you're tight in that we the coach right now balance and mixture they've moved from their five to the 45yard line found out their last live this was a nine minute drive to the outside because Roosevelt told that I made a very big plane last week to help bring them from behind and beat Buffalo stop some experimenting too bad have a other Colts like to run that stretch play to the numbers and then what the Patriots want to do is set a hardedged Colvin right there sets a hardedged in other words where you're playing on their side of the liner stroke you see fallin get in the back you just push everything back and Edgerrin James can't get to those raised in Indianapolis and with the school in Indiana at Purdue third down and six at the 43 yard line yeah that's that's he'll silent count yeah when the quarterback moves his leg like that he was going on Tariq Glen left on one the ball came out on three I thought Peyton Manning knew that he had to get the ball snap because he's the guy who see him hook up he looked up at the clock and then he looked up at the clock twice and said come on give it to me marek glenn liston protector he may have been watching the clock Saturday waiting until Saturday to snap at third down and 11 at the 38 yard they Rock goes all the way down to Manning under pressure by Mike Grable so many big place most of them of course defensively occasionally offensively touchdown in a Super Bowl and Manning as a moving down the field and in the raid those numbers you see frayed well here he's he's on Dallas Clark and he's playing he's jamming I'm at the line of scrimmage he knows he has helped over the top so he is going to trail him underneath now Peyton Manning gets a little rushing low push he not only moves sideways but he moves backwards that's a and that he just threw that ball short great play by Mike Vrabel at the 47 a if it was slamming the look as if man couldn't stop Indianapolis they get the big guy and his baby planning his shoulders the blame is Newson free and is recovered by New England back at the 29yard line by Tom a short the right tackle what Brady is so good at avoiding the rush where he wrapped that time 79 coming in with that shoulder rule but this time it loses the ball and they're lucky to recover because usually when he makes that shoulder move he can also step up you see he has the playaction pass and as he goes to step up Raheem Brock just grabs him and throws him to the ground you know the thing that slowed him up a little there I was the playaction fake you know that that will delay you a little making that fake and then when he came out of it Brock was right on him crafty national after the Astros got back there back on 18 yard loss at second it's you can only get back to the 34yard line that's a gain of five it'll be third down in twenty three the Patriots have two rookie linemen on the left side and I think they thought that's where they were going to get the pressure from their left offensive side but they've really been getting it from the right side Tom Ashworth it seemed to be having more trouble than cassia and Mankins a two lucky left a Quillin right back I mean West back to west for 7:30 plays this is only the 17th morning lady eats it's David Gibbons who gets free on the left side for a first down that's what makes Tom Brady great as you can have a bad play you can have things not go well you can get a bad pass brush you can get all these things but you just hang in there you just hang in there and keep playing again that was that cover to and they get behind the corner and in front of the safety see David Devils once he gets beyond that corner then he's gonna have a high before he gets to the safety Jason David who got burned on the touchdown on the play and now Cory the line of scrimmage we're gonna have to go in the opening hand wife rainy getting a blow and this is this is a time that you would think that the the Colts would love to have Dwight Freeney in there in fact they looked like he was going to go in there then he he stopped but this is when you have to have them you know when you know you want him on one side now you know that you have Robert Mathis on this side but the two of them together can be lethal second down and nine big casting that did it again Laurie was complaining for a first down to the 18 bracket and Goss combine on the head that saddl that's that old ramp way where you you fake the ball to the receiver and then hand in the draw you see how fake it out there to the left reverse pivot and then come back and hand it to Cory dela that's a pretty good fake it sure opens things up in the middle you go back just enough to invite the pass rush up a level then you get fake like you're gonna throw it and then hand it to your back and by the the middle is open seven times for billing 26 yards he gets it again this time is no game the boilers Jason David still loose at midfield 30 yard lines up with the football there's an official way back here on the 25yard line pointing to a spot as the ball is down he's saying bring it back to the 20 he's going to bring it back to the 27 yard line Belichick has come out onto the runner was down by contact there you go what a break for New England that Bob Sanders knocked that ball out of there again down by contact that can't be challenged he might be well he might not be talking about Dylan he might be talking about Jason David who was he talking about if he's talking about Dylan it's New England's wall not to be challenged if he's talking about David that's a different story so now they have to huddle up again which runner does he mean you know you know who started that thing was Monta rhaegar I mean he got he's got so much penetration there right there you see him he almost got to Tom Brady before the handoff the kid the key thing here is if he said Dylan is down that's it not to be challenged that means the whistle had blown if he means David who comes up with a fumble like right there that's a different story so Bernie's gonna clear it up for us whose ball and you can tell an indie thinks it's theirs and you indeed exactly and that's what you want to do get it right and they got it right that Rutter 207 to the half after the Dylan fumble another good one next Monday back to fill it up here we go the Cowboys against the Eagles Sunday night ESPN the Browns against the six and to Pittsburgh one thing we do know about next Monday night you won't see Terrell Owens and anecca see him play for Philadelphia for the rest of the year and we'll capsulize that for you at halftime first and 10 after the villains fumble New England giving it up Indianapolis rocks in a 27 yard line to the team straight turnovers in the lead a touchdown bought by Harrison Marvin Harrison steps out of bounds at his own 43 yard line and with 202 on the clock the winded here after a 17yard game and that will take us to the twominute warning 120 seconds remaining at a good first half in Foxborough 14 to 7 Indianapolis Lexus halftime show we'll talk about the Owens suspension to McGraw will be along of course with week 9 highlights we'll have a good minute with Jimmy Kimmel as well on Alexis halftime show now one of the things Tony Dungy wanted from his defense was to be more physical one of those guys that is more physical as Bob Sanders and he's the guy he takes it to the 36 yard line looking ahead each team with two timeouts to a ton of time from Manning as he moves the ball 20 yards downfield first out of the 36 this is a real advantage to the Colts because they're always in a hurry up offense Brandon Stokley gets into the action Stokely makes the catch he's out of bounds at the 24 yard line his first grab of the evening yeah we're seeing something right here that Bill Belichick was talking about the other day he said these guys always seem to have good field position said Peyton Manning in this offense can swing field position faster than any team in the NFL and we're seeing it happen and at a point today they will punt very much you'll see much of the punting unit as we look at the films of their games and Indianapolis noted for Manning and not only ball control but a lot of offense and you don't see their punter very often because usually when he does get his his completions they're they're pretty good chunk and then you know it's a good combination Edgerrin James running getting chunks running and then getting bigger chunks in the passing game go punch tonight Wendy war at the 24yard line in a minute with 28 it's second down and ten that's what Harrison comes back to make the catch and they will mark it a little short of a first down you know that's the thing about Peyton Manning and and that's what Bill Belichick was talking about the other day and so true it's in right here if there is something or someone open he is going to find it third in line equipment James inside the Tenny he's down at the 8 yard line and we first down and goal peyton manning said the way they're playing him now is he didn't think it's just something this year he said they started last year you know that 49 TV playing they're not be the one that gives up the TV playing the one and that slows them up and down he goes Ryan Luger the left guard got involved in the action it'll be second down and goal with a half a minute to go well you hate that as an offensive lineman you're pulling out there you never get matching and then you started to pull you back second down and that is incomplete over the top of Raymond's Stokley tie war and put the pressure on with 14 seconds now it's third down the timeworn is a guy that doesn't get mentioned a lot for these Patriots but is a very good player he's a very explosive player you know I mean in about two steps he's halfway to the court 14 seconds third down going on trying to limit them to a field goal attempt Dominic lols comes into the game and the woman's going to take a timeout so James was out roads comes in timeout taken by the defense Boston thirty miles to the north here we are in Foxborough you know one thing one thing that this hurry up offense or nohuddle offense does is it really tires the defense down and you can just feel that the Patriots are getting tired now Brady's pitching a perfect game but right now his team is trailing by seven and the way I'm trying to limit that lead at halftime to Tanith by setting up a few lowly third down and goal here at the 10yard line village in the backyard flanking make the catch and stays inbounds touchdown he wasn't juggling the ball though as he was spinning around there baton man they put it there perfectly you watch him he just puts that ball up there Reggie Wayne gets it spins around I don't know if he has complete control of it though again you've got no challenge here you've got the guys upstairs we'll have to stop it juggling ball is still moving around a little bit and where is he in relation to the end zone I don't know I mean to me that's a catcher you know we're always looking when a guy catches the ball to find out why it's not a catcher a fumble why it's not a fumble that was a great throw and catch good throw good catch I think they made the right call but a little surprised they didn't stop it considering the importance of it touchdown Wayne 217 Indy's run 39 plays New England's run 20 time of possession about 17 and a half for Indianapolis and a little less than 12 and a half to this point or to England Manning has led him on those three drives Harrison talking things over with Starks on the banks and Reggie Wayne with at spinning grab in the end zone to make it 217 didn't you feel at the end of that Drive though that the that the Patriot defense was was really spent absolutely and Manning can make you feel I mean the way he moves peace because he makes you be ready all the time takes it from the heat back up to the 32 time for one play for Brady in these first four possessions tonight touchdown touchdown then the pick after they've moved 33 yards Manning throwing it the Rabil then they started their own 27 following the Corey Dillon fumble and that results in an Indianapolis touchdown now that's not a bad formula if you if you give up a turnover get one right back and then you're even and that's what they did and you look at the secondary on the bench it'll be a near line by Brady and that's going to end the first half and so the Colts trying to get rid of their Patriots paranoia leading at the half it's 217 the own suspension tim mcgraw jimmy kimmel coming up on the lexus halftime show after this message to the NFL and a word from our ABC stations the Colts bringing in the pain and Harris's brainy here and regulates spins around touchdown and back to Foxborough Massachusetts we come Al Michaels John Madden and Sam Ryan as we start the third quarter they've Raynor to kickoff for the Indianapolis Colts Bethel Johnson back to receive for New England so New England has Tom Brady go ten for ten in the first half and yet they are down by two touchdowns fielded six yard line this was the second by Indianapolis and he's tackled at the 21 by Kelvin Hayden let's go to Sam Ryan Sam I caught up with a frustrated Bill Belichick at the half I asked him what are you gonna do defensively to slow down their offense he said we just have to play better I said how so he said just play better we can't wave a magic wand as for Tony Dungy he said he's happy with his offense they looked sharp they look focused as for his defense he said they just seemed a little too hyped up a little too wired left it off the hook a couple times on third and long he said we have to tackle better and we have to play a full 30 minutes out and they came up with a big turnover there when it looked like the Patriots moving in four would have been attacking us down ladies first incomplete pass of the night intended for the tight end then Washington you know and that's what Bill Belichick has to be talking about now to the Patriots okay you know let's get out there let's start establishing you know some offense get some first hands do those kinds of things and then on defense we have to be a little more aggressive we have to go after the ball we have to get turnovers because usually when the Patriots would get to play the paper there's something to beat themselves a lot traffic and that pass intended for Daniel Graham is incomplete yeah David Thornton the linebacker going back there along with Mike Doss for the coverage the other one thing Tom Brady said he has to do in this game is he has to look off the linebackers and the linebackers he's talking about it Cato June David Thornton and he does that you see him not come to the receiver that he's going to throw to until he looks the other way and then come back third down and 10 traffic and it's incomplete again yet double coverage here is Gary Brackett and some help on Daniel Graham it'll be four thousand out very quickly for the patch you know we look at this cover two and we talked about it the big thing is getting that middle linebacker down the middle deep and you see Brackett he knows that he has to he has the second receiver in so there'll be a flanger on one side number two was a tight end he just waited for him and ran down the middle of field woman now Miller to kick after a twenty two second three and out fair caught by Troy Walters so after Brady had gone ten for ten he goes old for three Mindy has the ball here comes Manning he leads by 14 and the aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by Budweiser looking into Gillette Stadium Foxborough Indianapolis has the ball its own 48 Manning his first possession in jeans one for a gain of a couple so with the mixandmatch defensively now for New England Randall gay who was starting at safety and then moves over to right corner they're gonna sit Wayne Starks down and put Mike stone in at safety I think Mike stone and safety is either the fifth or sixth safety that the Patriots have had there and again they haven't been happy with Duane starts all year so this is something this is probably Randall gays position anyway we could run out of bounds but he's able to pick up enough to make it a third and fairly short Wilfork runs him out take a look at how the Colts the guys have done to this point in game Peyton Manning a very efficient an effective first half of 181 yards and two TVs James carried the ball 18 times Ruth's point Oh average and Harrison with for grabs a foreigner 33 shotgun humor stokeley's caught a passion as if he caught the one want the 12yard so the end of the first you were looking for snorkeling and so was Manning for a first down on the third down play well you know he's the inside receiver he's the slide he'll be right or left but he's always the inside guy and and that's a guy Peyton Manning likes to go to especially if they're going to double the outside receivers and that's what we call an option route he'll start inside if the defender plays him inside he goes back to the outside like that if the guy plays him outside the inside Coruscant and the borders of the 40 back at one and man in science to call a timeout and not sure he got it that's the problem you know they don't huddle up but he still are near the hole highhat the line of scrimmage and you see on this one he gets up there over center or under center and then he goes back and gets in shotgun he gives the one that you know and the ball doesn't come tries to get the time out and that doesn't come till now first his 15 in Hanna Skandera secondhand I don't think first and 15 bothers him no not man we're a lot more than 15 intercepted Marvin Harrison the intended receiver and Asante Samuel step for step with him you know that's not a bad thing because you think after you have the penalty okay you're going to go back and try and get some of it back not Peyton Manning not the coke if you get one on one on Marvin Harrison out there he is going to run the deep pattern on you Peyton Manning just threw that a little short at Martin Marvin Harrison had a stuff on same knot behind him ball hard at it second down and 15 at the 45 Harrison makes the catch Tom or the offensive coordinator talking about more really sending in concepts more than plays and by the way happy birthday to Tom 67 tonight and he he does a great job I mean you talk about a a team in the the team of Tom Moore calling the plays along with Peyton Manning is a is a is a great offensive team than his offensive coordinator all the pages eight years as he's a mandolin pick in the draft overall out of Tennessee and he's and has been a slide to a stop to the 23 yard line so Manning picks up and keeps the chains moving on a 12 yard scamper I was talking earlier about Peyton Manning and you know seeing him on the field is he had such focus I had never seen that before I mean he had a look at and you know that in this game tonight whatever it takes he's going to do he's not a big runner with a ball but if you give him a gap tonight he is going to take it and run with it and welcome is convert on three on Thursday the 24yard warning bees time before brewski finally soft some second insured upcoming ran so hard he knocked the socks down but he is a powerful guy and and and the way that he can get down low and keep his powers to me is amazing yeah he's not a high runner he's always down and then and then at the end of the run he'll get down even lower and always keep those feet moving pick up enough for a first down before Colvin makes the tackle it'll leave the chain once again hold at the 13 yard line you think of all the times that Bill Belichick is as played against his cult team they would they would have the lead and it was like he always had their number I mean he kind of knew what they were gonna do and he had a guy or two there he don't feel that their defense has the number of the pulse tonight how much of that is the injury situation they don't want to use it as an excuse in the mission Harrison and his point by Marvin Harrison he takes the ball to the six yard line in the brewski of course missing all of the action this season until last week a lot of questions obviously concerning whether he would ever play football again after the surgery but he attended all of the meetings he was cleared by the doctors Bob Kraft was very careful to make money go to a lot of outside by walking over with his wife back he comes he was saying his wife just make sure any time you make a package get up folks second the two of the six yard line nothing happening there so they go from second to third and about three and a half is Willie McGinest makes the head again we talk about the stretch play that the Colts are trying to run through the numbers and need the edge that the Patriots are trying to set Willie McGinest when you run the places right Willie McGinest is the outside guy who's going to set the edge or right there third and four and then run on a quick count here and you've got a flag as James comes up a yard shot but there's a marker at the 9 yard line so Manning got up there and snapped it very fast well you know that's what he does if they're trying to substitute you know because they think that going nohuddle you shouldn't be able to substitute on him if you try and substitute he has where he just goes attack attack and then they go up there and snap the ball Berni cool car offside on the defense that man he was offside has a different typical see that's that's what it was he he saw him transepts you see he sees it he just goes attack attack and they just wrapped the ball and he knows he's gonna catch him with too many men in the field the other thing that he does down here is that direct snap you know that deal were he looks like he's going back to the back that was New England's first penalty delay the most inopportune time the honors given Dominick Royals who has come in for jeans and rolls is a cross for a touchdown Dominique woods gets to the goal line and in so Indianapolis converting on third down time after time opening drive for them in this half and now Brady and the Patriots are in a three touchdown hole Dominic Rhodes again is a is a good runner and could run with that same type of power I mean when you're when you're down here there's not a lot of moves you can make one cut and then you run downhill there's a cut now run downhill right to the goal line and get as low as you can would you say they ended Jan for the point after four times have the Colts been in the red zone four times have they scored touchdowns from the red zone 836 remaining in the period 28 to 7 Colts aerial coverage tonight if you look down into Gillette Stadium brought to you by Budweiser as you look down into Gillette Stadium that that strip in the middle where there's no grass is up very they play soccer and he brings it back up to the 27 yard line where Rob Morris plaints him robbed Boris had been the starting middle linebacker on this team and he got beat out but he does a job here on special teams sometimes statistics lie but not those that's your ballgame right there yeah well you know it's just looking at saying this this patriot defense looks dead tired and then when you look you know how many how many plays they've been out there how long they this cold offensive just warning bound ladies in the throat of the outside and Troy Braun is going to not be able to make the catch in bounds Tony Dungy if he gets a big lead he doesn't COFF it up very often Tony through his career and the court fee of the six years of Tampa and now for an Indianapolis 15 and all when he is a 14 or more point margin you know you think of all these years at Tampa you always have a good running game in a good defense and that all and a pretty good Depot but can he get through the Monday night kibosh kibosh that he's every time we do that not every time but I'll why we'll put something like that up and the next thing you know hello right but I think that I mean I think that Tony Dungy has that for a reason because I think that's that's the kind of coach he is I'm he's all about fundamentals being solid techniques of those kinds of things very bang made the pockets last lag is killing it out and a little bit more than 20 seconds in this one at Lisa Kimberly makes the catch going straight down the field and the ball is at midfield as we go to sand and now you're talking about the Colts defense Hill Corey Simon briefs experience and leadership to the defense having played against the Patriots with the Eagles in the Super Bowl he told me the main thing is keeping these guys grounded he said our schedule gave us the opportunity to have success early but up until this point we hadn't played anyone yet hadn't played the Patriots they still have to play the Steelers he told me this defense has not played well enough to win a Super Bowl they need to talk a letter he said we haven't done anything yet before tonight's game China to attract the attention Philadelphia become a free agent Knutson who escapes the first tackle and then takes the ball to the 41 yard line a couple shy of the first down Indianapolis to this point in the season and where they rank the opponents where the opponent's rank in points per game as you can see only the Rams would get up to a 17 to nothing lead against Indian that Monday night game before Bulger got her to drop that one because you would have taken a loss Garry bracket with the coverage it'll be third down but I'll say this about the Colts they are better I mean you know you can look at their schedule and say that you know that they haven't played any tuff T's maybe they haven't but they've done what they've had to I mean they're they're an undefeated team they they knew that they had to be more aggressive they knew that they had to be more physical on defense they've gotten that they've gotten better there and they are a better team now you talking about Peyton Manning and what this game means to him and ask these focused deliver that show first down here they need a good Drive here to the 31yard line Stephen Neal helped to lead the way first down for the Patriots I think about Corey Dillon you know after he has that that turnover I mean you get so upset about it you just want to get the ball in there and just run it right down their throat I mean you want to erase the bad taste of that turnover and that was Dillon's first fumble of the year earlier and the Patriots appeared headed for a sighing touchdown instead Indianapolis to make a 212 seven lady in the pocket lady gets hit his arm got hit as he moved forward Rahim Brock is there he's been a pest all night to force the incomplete pass now Rahim Brock is an interesting story remember he was he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles like in the seventh round and they didn't have enough money after they signed all their draft choices they didn't have enough money for him so they couldn't sign him so they had to make him a free agent he never went to camp with him and then he ends up with a cult so here's here's a guy that would have been a Philadelphia Eagle had they just had a little more money the tannin team going back into the game we talked earlier about that to the Patriots run more screens than they don't just run him to the backs they run him to everyone then run him to wide receivers and in this case that's in your gramma tight in you'll see him he's on the right side Tom Brady goes fakes to the left of twirls comes back to Daniel Graham where the screen is set up on the right side so the tight ends are very big on that drive Akeem third that watson then Graham takes it into the endzone finitary for the point after and they needed a good draw get it it's whether the world champions 5:46 left in the third twenty eight to 14 Austin she's a state capital still have beautiful fall foliage on the seventh of November outside a tip here and it's gonna backfire with a flag thrown as Joseph Jefferson comes up with it so Adam Bennett airy approaching it and Bill Belichick deciding down by 14 he'd give it a shot here and Indianapolis pending this referees or officials conference should wind up with a bulb in New England territory you know we were just talking about that with the defense being as as tired as they are and not really able to to stop this cold offense this wouldn't be a bad time for an onside kick and the most advantageous time is when it's a surprise onside kick off slide on the kicking team will add five yards from where the play ended first on insult to insult so Belichick with a big gamble of course Manning now has a very short field with by 44 left in the third Bill Belichick lost his to coordinators Romeo Crennel went to Cleveland Charlie Weis went to Notre Dame Eric Mangini when the secondary coach is the defensive coordinator the bay is the defensive Gould and that defense were really New England gets back in the game the illfated onside kick and Edgerrin James takes the ball to the 19 yard line you know John it's easy to secondguess here it you get back in the game you have 20 minutes to go on the game the downside of not recovering that onside kick and giving Manning that short field is enormous yeah you don't want to do that and then you know you just get some momentum and you'd like to play off that won't matter that's one hand I think he doesn't have a lot of confidence in his defense he would like to get them some more rest and if the thing works you know he would have been a genius but I think it's as much about defense and maybe his matchup on defense with the Colt offense it is anything else that he doesn't he doesn't feel that they're matching up well right now that's a great point and a very telling point and who would have ever thought we'd be talking about Belichick losing a little faith in his defense well he's having trouble in that secondary he's already taking Duane sparks out there he started Randle gay at safety that moves him to corner so Sparks was beaten pretty well and he doesn't he just doesn't have confidence in that second or third and seven that's a 9 out of 11 converting they won't convert here but they will set up a band urge at field goal that's Brandon Stokley making the CAC so spot the ball at about the 17 yard line and forthcoming will be roughly a 36yard field goal attempt so if Vander jet makes this field goal then it was the gamble was a threepoint gamble I mean he lost he lost three points he loses three points but he also advantage that makes the field goal it goes from a two possession game to a threepossession game they're gonna spot it at the 25 it's a 35yard attempt hunters sniff will hold and Vander jet sends it right down the middle so the Colts tack on three more with 4:45 remaining in the third quarter and Tony Dungy team is up by a score of 31 to 14 so what happens if Indianapolis wins okay they know they've kind of gotten over the hump at least during the regular season the other thing here John will be they almost certainly assure themselves of not having to come back here in the playoffs they'd have a fourgame lead over New England they'd have one head to head so if New England is going to face in the again it would be in Indianapolis and of course you know what the media's gonna start with next week Miami 1972 well you know I was talking to someone who told me that Bob Griese says that that they usually don't start there you know watch until someone wins ten games so they still have a couple more but for that I mean assuming if they win here tonight but you know Tony Dungy was saying last night he said he tried to play this game down not if if they lose but if they win he said you know he doesn't want them to think if they win okay that's it season's over we're there yeah I mean he wants it if you win okay we have to go go back to work and you know play the next one now if the if you lose you know that you do that you say okay we lost now we have to correct the mistake and we have to go but if you win you know they may say hey it's all over we've done it that's what he's guarding against seasons only halfway over for this team tonight another eight down there's another short kick kicked off specialist and that's bethel johnson bringing it back under 32 by sat spotlight recaps tonight here's Manning his numbers two TVs and 211 yards harrison with a touchdown grab right there to get him started James has carried the ball a total of 22 times he's been as usual the workhorse Brady with a couple of touchdowns tonight and 166 yards and then Daniel Graham helping to get them back into the game with that cutting out they see if the packs can mount another big drive board David Givens on the other end of that pass and a first down one thing about Brady when he gets back there and that and that last foot hits that ball is coming out of there and whether it's one two three out one two three four five out but watch from that when that when that right foot hits that ball is on its way out and he is very very tough to rush and he doesn't look at his receiver he look off then come back to him when that back this it's done Thursday they do a little game Marlon Jackson couldn't tackle him and he picks up about two to the 47 of the Colts Corey Dillon is one of those running backs Emmitt Smith was that way that always carries the ball in his left hand you know they're both running backs they will carry the ball when they get to the sideline they'll put the ball in the outside outside hand so that if they do hit the ball goes out of bounds Corey Dillon always keeps it in his left hand second and eight nine Patriots have not had a David Givens makes the catch it'll be third down and four from the 43 yard line Kato Jun makes the head well you know that's the formation and I thought they would use a lot of tonight if they can't run and that's that empty backfield five wide receivers Grady getting back being able to see the whole field getting rid of it to the open guy quickly you'd like to gain more yards than they did on that last night third down and four the 33 yard line under 10 minutes capela carried Colts up by 17 they led by 14 at halftime Deion Branch the intended receiver and Marlon Jackson was in the neighborhood and might have gotten a piece of it now if you're going to onside kick then you might as well go for it on fourth down in this situation again I think part of this is confidence and Tom Brady and I think part of this is not having a lot of confidence in your defense against Peyton Manning put those two together and they're going to go forward right if you're going to make a play make it here on offense fourth and four quickly and the pass is incomplete real face slant intended for David Gibbons Nick Harper is there to break it up and Manning's going to get the ball back near midfield and Nick Harper probably anticipated that one because remember in the first half on on fourth down they went for it and they went for that same thing that quick slant out there Nick Harper was right there with it he didn't let him get inside David Givens on that has to get to the inside and Harper didn't let him get to the inside from the 44 Peyton Manning with a 17 point lead and the ball two and a half to go in the future so you would think at a point in the game when the Colts might start to use the clock a little bit Mannix's uhuh we don't have enough it's a 29yard games and that's Peyton Manning and that's his cold offense and that's Tom Moore and that's the way they do things when you think they're going to do something they don't if you give them anything they're going to get it that time it was it was Reggie Wayne right there on Randall Gaye that passes of more than 20 yards beyond the line of scrimmage tonight manning who's had a tough time on long passes this year three out of five every kind of fest was 49 touchdown passes but this year they haven't been going deep that often and they haven't been going deep that effectively until tonight his two receivers tonight 13 cashes for the two of them as they approach a combined 200 yards in each for the touchdown well he has so much confidence in Reggie Wayne now we know these always had confidence in Marvin Harrison second down and eight at the 24 yard there's Harrison making the catch spotted very close to a first down they were talking to Martin to Bill Belichick the other day about Marvin Harrison and he says you ever remember that guy ever missing a game if it seems like every time you watch the call to watch him on film you watch him on TV Marvin Harrison is out there I mean there's not much to him you know I mean he's he's a little guy but he never misses he never gets hurt even his Manning Manning's made every start of his career he started his rookie in the opening game and tonight number one twenty first and ten at the 16 yard line James to the twelve harrison playing you know you talk about not getting her but he has a cast there it is of her braces Tony Dungy calls it but he won't he won't talk to the doctors about this no he won't let him check it and he knows there's something wrong with his left wrist and it's hurt but you're gonna play anyway so why why get into medical terms about what's wrong with it he won't even go to trial he won't talk about it denial he talked about a lot of things second and six seconds of the period rocky was right there in Reggie Wayne's hand but it's incomplete we third down you just feel a Willie McGinest getting closer and closer to him in the past Russian so Tony Dungy was saying last night you know he said that he said Peyton Manning doesn't get hurt because he never gets hit by anything doesn't see you know you know here's Willie McGinest coming on the mouth you can't watch the rusher but you have to know when he's close to get rid of the ball and then get ready to take that hit and form when you don't get surprised don't see that's one of your head go down in six ten to twelve the toxin Raymond Stokely he'll take it to the five and then they'll change ends of the field and have first and gold when we resume so three quarters in the books in Foxborough Indianapolis 31 New England 14 Monday Night Football back after this message from our ABC sales fourthquarter Al Michaels John Madden Sam Ryan Foxborough Massachusetts 3114 Indianapolis ESPN SportsCenter follows the game for recap in the news and all of the rest as Tony Dungy steam tries to stay undefeated go to ain't no first and goal ended fall at the 5yard line James aligned back to the 2yard line Italy second down and goal for the goals you know I hear people say you know why why does he do that what's he doing up there the line of scrimmage was he talked so much about that and and then some people say well he's not saying anything it doesn't mean anything well it does mean something he's calling to play he said when you have have no huddle then then you have to get up and call the play right there at the line of scrimmage so all this that he has three plays so he's calling one of three plays and in just one artifact is the ultimate program and how many guys call their own place meanwhile there's no mystery in Indianapolis how it gets done but there's a lot of mystery in New England as the who's called in the plays there's Tom Brady you got Brady charlie weis who used to call the place is now a Notre Dame and they haven't even named an offensive coordinator no and I think that Bill Belichick is as taken that and I think at the quarterback coach john josh mcdaniels was a guy he's on the night is the Brady summit third down and goal for Manning now from the two Oh Reggie Wayne so it'll be fourth down and they're going to send Vanderjagt and company out onto the field he doesn't want to hear about something again it's that slant and it's and it's getting inside and I'll tell you these then and Peyton men just threw that ball low but these these wide receivers of the Colts have really had their way with the secondary of the Patriots it looked a little awkward but he bangs it through line drives it through to make it a 20point game 34:14 early in the fourth pumps they are easy so what state you gonna do to me he's gonna do anything and everything to get over this thing then as Quaid in our teas tonight summing it all up the hump I mean this humps become a mountain but they climb in the matter right now and they can see the top up at 34:15 Indianapolis it's a mountain they've been carrying on their back and it's gonna be off there tonight runs it back to the 31yard line to Philly we go NFC East great rivalry anytime Dallas meets fill it up here it's fun and we'll be there next Monday night they do look at the standings the Giants halfway through the season with Eli Manning at six and two Cowboys come off their bye week Washington one last night and here too thought Philadelphia at the bottom of the division if this prank I think they have to get over that TL hangover and get on with winning some games and they did to do that today everybody's name for the season Deion Branch making the catch out near midfield and the Patriots will go without a huddle as they come up to the line at the 49 yard line when you feel Tom Brady some that just makes it look so easy you wonder why you didn't do that all night and wrote down four touchdowns they didn't have the balling off of one of the reasons yeah that's a big reason is incomplete because yet in Indianapolis story minute long drive and then Brady answered and then the Colts had another long drive so 20 minutes into the game that had the ball only one time to it and that's going to be the thing you know it because I've been in games like that coach the games like that and then you say why didn't we do this why didn't we do that why didn't we run more why didn't we pass outside well why didn't you do that now the answer we didn't have a ball no running game tonight for New England Dillons carried 11 times for 40 yards but they have on 34 net yards tonight on 13 carries well you know it usually goes with with a good running game is one being ahead and two good defense the Patriots having that either one of those things tonight third down and three at the Indy 45 under pressure totally stood for Floyd Brown the venerable one Brown now who can play both to the sides is the corner as well thirteenth year in the league first down Nick cassia the the rookie left tackle has really done a pretty good job and Dwight Freeney out there tonight I mean I mean they've been doing a lot of stunning and stuff with Freeney almost got there but but because they had the middle solid that Tom Brady was able to step up first morning when you draw down on the inside handle any money and that this is the first guy there to stop man for a very minimal game they should have run the draw right at Dwight Freeney that's usually what you do win it when a pass rusher it's an old NFL thing when a pass rusher gets a sack where it gets close to the quarterback and you're going to run a draw on the next play you usually run it right at the guy that got there and that was a big draw hole open to that side first down to the 23 yard line talking about josh mcdaniels before the young quarterbacks coach even though there is no designated offensive coordinator he would be about as close to it as anybody well you can see he's a guy that you know has the place sheet so for whoever has the place sheet is he who calls the point since Moulton's Daniel mountaintop plagg is wrong because it look like coming around on the right side not even greenie Jonathan Walsh actually number 99 who was the guy who either got a phenomenal start or an illegal one I think the officiating tonight has been pretty good it has been and you know we've seen our Sheriff officiating this year that could be classified from time to time is dubious ballpark number 70 second offense you know anytime anytime after you get set if the officer moves a little then that's woman just just watch his left arm right here he set there yes the stay set you see just that little right there is what that's the move that got the pass rusher started and that is a little move and that's the site you don't see a lot folks for the parting before the end of the game here though these folks here haven't seen their team be behind like this 34 to 14 in fourth quarter or lose very often it was a novelty especially here it had that long home winning streak which ended against San Diego back on the 2nd of October retirement there's only been 8 total penalties tonight 5 on Indy and 3 on New England so it's the ocean 15 on the board 29 partisan today Margie Bailly who stays in the block Deion Branch who's covered by Jason David about five yards ila first and that Dwight Freeney comes back in he has a he has a bad arch and he doesn't he doesn't practice a lot yes so therefore he can't go a lot of plays so they comprise to pick this spot you know the second long third down red zone where they need to play white flannel usually bi name second in a nanosecond and five ladies gonna back off baby the second indeed Wilson and the pass is caught by brown for the touchdown so brainy went to the line of scrimmage under center to come in he moved him back outside he went into the shotgun and it's brown for 19 yards and a touchdown and that's the guy that you look forward you need a big play here he is in the slot it Tom Brady was saying that he's just dependable and consistent you know where he's going to be close we could Tom Brady there he he looks off and then he pumps off and then he comes back to his receiver Cory brown but Dungey Mike being too late now military for the point after so Troy brown balls England still breathing down by 13 with 1015 to go aerial coverage tonight provided by Budweiser after the Brown touchdown will New England onside ticket meanwhile the other side of the knife commercial we're gonna show you I said I was surprised Dungy to challenge that and we'll take a look at an angle shortly where it looks like grounded but that's all history now conventional kick field up to the 26 yard line and now can the New England defense get the ball back in a hurry it's up to them try to get them right back in the game it's a 13point differential at 34 21 we'll look at that brown catch on the other side of this tree during the break Tony Dungy was joining with the officials we're gonna go back and show you the ground touchdown after this play and I mentioned that thought he was going to challenge it but he didn't and he probably would along with challenged the balls at the 26 yard line and Manning's Dennis family Reggie Wayne go back to brown snatch and you'll see an angle here where he'll make the catch and the ball is going to hit the ground right there they win the challenge it would have been no touchdown they was Tony with the flag but he puts it back in his pocket and he's thinking now I should have reversed that yeah he started coming in that should have gone out for the 44 yard line and that's what and Wayne makes the catch and that's a first down so back to back to Reggie Wayne to the 44 of New England and Wayne has now caught nine balls for 124 yards Harrison was 7 for 101 you know and they're catching them on all kinds of corners I mean they had Duane starts in there and they beat him then they took him out now they put Randall gay in there and you know you're gonna play a mostly zoned that whatever they play they really had a difficult time with these outside receivers at the 44 Manning approaching 300 yards he's a does inside that figure James the little hole if you big Wayne and Harrison tonight they put 16 combined catches there's the first one that's that big one to Marvin Harrison me up I mean the post and then two quick up here's Reggie Wayne wonder why Dwayne starts those are some of the reasons second and five would be 39 age 15 to play Ellis Hobbs is in the game and apparent rookie can Iowa State and James did stop here so you've got a very key defensive play here for New England third down to the clock running down you're still in the game and Manning's that get up to the substitute it's the same playing any any time any time they tried substitute blue he goes attack attack that time the Patriots got a timeout and forces the only one to use its first of three the Patriots first five games you see the numbers other story after the time I forced by Manning get the snack off and the way in China substitute its third down and two and here's James and that's a big first down because that's gonna get up another couple of minutes it's gonna get them into field goal range and the ball is it the 30yard line with the first down yeah right in there tight behind the center Jeff Saturday and Ryan lil Jilly the the center and left guard I mean they get a pretty good takeoff right here here and here they get a doubleteam and you see the guard lil just comes right up on the linebacker he gets to that second level and that was really the plow they've got the head drew James through there the play clock and you've got a whistle before the snap here you know when he catches him in that attack attack on that snap is between second third down and less fun he's always looking for it 78 off it was their number one pick out a cow back in 97 tonic Glen has had about three or four though he had a holding and in a couple of false starts unusual but you know it's tough to be a cult offensive lineman because you have to stay in your stance so long and be writing while Peyton Manning first and 15 and parallel to that John tough to beat defensive lineman and stay in your stance while he's doing all that stuff yeah that's the thing because you never know when he's going to snap it you say well you can wait and tell he gets under there and then they'll direct snap it or you can say well you know we have plenty of time and then he'll see you try and substitute he'll go attack the pack real quick snap so they they do put their offensive line into a little climb but they put the defense in a lot bigger mind James is approaching a hundred yards on the ground Manning approaching 300 to the Aaron Harrison already into triple figures as his Lane second and ten he's got his name that's Marvin Harrison for the touchdown thirty yards as he hits number 88 for touchdown number 88 between the two yeah and that's why they do all that work I mean they know each other so well here you'll see it he sees him out there he's just looking for him all the way he tried to pump it and then throw it but he got a little pass rush and he had to move out to the right peyton manning did and then he just gave it everything he had and it ended up right and Marvis and Harrison's hands perfectly add one to that total because 88 came earlier this is his second of the night so 89 times in their careers as Manning hit Harrison for a touchdown you know you can too gave him a double move and that's when he tried to pry the pompidou because he got the pass rush he had to get to the outside but they came in a blitz they covered and you can't do that to Marvin Harrison and the crowd is going because the coast line up to go for two to try to make it a 21point lead instead of a 20point and now you've got a flag you got a challenge flag from Belichick publishing Indianapolis for going for two but balichek must have seen something that we didn't see because the challenge would have to be on Marvin Harrison touchdown catch it's the last play when Harrison can't figure that you know they you know I've watched them practice the Colts and you and they practice offensively and they practice individually they do all those things that when the defense practices then then Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison will go off on the side and well there's no challenge I don't know if bill dropped the flag there's no question about that so he wanted to either challenge something or to get ku car or one of the officials over to complain about something I thought that was going to be a penalty if you if you challenge when you didn't have a challenge or or couldn't challenge because you can also challenge oh and if they let you do that you can use the challenges pile out and if there's been gamesmanship through the years we've seen it but they haven't put enough teeth into that rule you can see bill was so angry just flung the thing and then I think you know being down 42 21 he's he's frustrated and probably upset with the officials you know for the whole evening although I thought they've done a good job but he just wanted to talk to him by that and that Manning's upset because he said wait a second he's trying to take the rhythm away from us we're hot we're gliding up for two and what am i doing standing around here for the light minute and a half now you're ahead 42 21 so you can be like Marvin Harrison just fold your arm whatever it is though Bill Belichick must have a point because bernie cou cars going back to him hello Chuck still has that red flag on his right hand one thing Manning might be upset about okay so back we go and of course the minute we begin to praise the official isn't that Klingon the games been officiated you got this so they'll be a challenge as to what exactly we don't know but we will tell you so that so we've been looking at the replays and there's nothing that's going to overturn this that the touchdown will count Belichick that could have been penalized for attempting the catch it is a touch stop charge you can't you can't penalize a coach for throwing a challenge play without a challenge so it's possible just going to surmise he throws the flag it's totally going to be penalized because there is no challenge and then he says well one let's go ahead and challenge it then I don't want the penalty pop craft well he hasn't had many nights like this where is he right we'll go to two when a fade to the deuces pending for Reggie Wayne Ellis Hobbs covering on the place so the lead will remain 19 points with 553 and Reggie Wayne was slowing getting back up and over look there wasn't many times that he threw to Reggie Wayne tonight the Reggie Wayne didn't catch the ball I think Reggie Wayne runs right into our camera yes Lee one of what one of our men well that's close up and personal everybody's alright yeah he's saying what the heck something just hit me between the eyes like account there's no camera to get into dens and Boston all of the tunnel I think it's that same tunnel we just take with us every week we always have a moving truck there's only so it's a moving town today the Colts have really really looked good tonight I mean they you know they've done well and offense obviously and and their defense played played well against you know a good offensive good quarterback in Tom Brady and the special teams have been very active and hardhitting and tackling crisply talking about the appreciate existence walk on the headlight all at once and what Bernie cool car is doing here the clock in a clock malfunction so he's saying we set the the play clock either that or sometimes they'll kick off before the official said kick off you know there has to be a signal the official down deep you know gives a signal to kick off and sometimes a kicker will kick before he gets that signal these two teams have met a lot 66 games remember they used to be in the same division and forty points tonight most ever scored by the Colts whether it's Indy or Baltimore against the Patriots whether it's Boston or New England isn't Peyton Manning calm with his offensive line and his offensive line coach tonight very very fine offensive line we bring it back with a flag down at the 37 yard line you know I think the Colts needed this one it was you know I had said earlier that somewhere yeah oh yeah but 44 of the return team at the 10yard penalty you know and this is one of their yeah butts I mean you can you can be undefeated you can beat these other teams yeah but you can't beat the Patriots or or to Peyton Manning yeah you can win a lot of games you can have all these records yeah but you can't beat Tom Brady so they eliminated a couple of yeah but still and they have for what it's worth in the minds of some I'm sure validating themselves not that they hadn't done that to this plant the clearing even a rank the teams in the National Football League there is no question that the coach would be number one otherwise you're just trying to make noise and that's incomplete if this was the collegefootball they would be a unanimous number1 in any poll yeah I mean you don't get anything from being there at the halfway point but I think that you know as as Tony Dungy was saying the big thing for them he thinks is that by you know not having to play that first week get one less game and then then if you get home feel that's great but the biggest thing is the bye and then you go from there Tony's led his team to the playoffs he needs to the last six seasons last week Tampa first three with the face swing it out to the tightend then Watson makes the catch Hallman rode some of the differences here for the Colts home games you can see Peyton Manning with a record of 2 &amp; 1 averaging 35 points per game that you send them away from the dome 1 and 4 and the Colts average 14 per game there's probably some reasons for that like weather and plus when you play in the road the other teams better you know that's why they get to hope there's not a thing that they vote for the league does I'm in need by having the best record during the regular season you earn the right to a home playoff game and so your record is better than the team that you're playing and that one seat or two seat is gigantic as you say because that gives you that week off and guarantees you at least we're number one of course of guarantees you home filled up to the Super Bowl in all the years that you've watched Peyton Manning have you ever seen him as focused or determined as he was tonight and that's saying something because he normally is very focused and determined but you know when they talk about raising an advisor taking it to another level those Walters makes the catch yeah tonight's the night here's Peyton inside out best piece of advice prepare yourself pocket have dinner with one famous person it would be Elvis Presley favorite Footloose by Kenny Loggins best describes me strangest requests and the plan is shaving my autograph in his back here I hope you didn't do it here sometimes you just have to say no yeah I want to know now if that request was granted on acquiring mines lead to know you know one of the things I think for this reason in video and the big night that he's had here is during the bye week he didn't throw it all so he felt it coming back and getting ready this week is armed what was really alive and then he started that way following these kind of balls 80 yards and three touchdowns and now he's into a clock milking mode second and 70 from the 23 another 40 seconds up to the 26 yard line Edgerrin James does he's been doing it all night I mean he's a very powerful runner and but but the closer he gets to being hit the lower he gets you know and he has like three different degrees of being low and then right at the end he gets to the lowest where his darn there's is his facemask is on the ground and it's tiny but a spectacular night for a but you look at the numbers over the sudden he's two yards away from the hundred yards on the ground someone has to do the hard work and the dirty work and Edwin James did that tonight by jeans and jeans were that extra little effort there should have enough for a first down that's going to take us just about down to the twominute warning before the Colts would even have to think about pumping bill belichick will regather his group during the weekend with Brady shaking his head they will go to Florida and play the Dolphins in Miami next Sunday and we talked about Peyton Manning what a great competitor he is Tom Brady is too and you know and to have the upper hand to three out of four you know Super Bowl champions have that and then and then lose it you lose something tonight you know you can say it's just a game believe me this one tonight isn't isn't just a game for either one of these teams and there is Brady and that pretty much sums it up I mean that's that's your your picture of the evening from the New England vantage point meanwhile James has now run for 101 yards James and Harrison you think two of the three would be in Indianapolis triplets 20 times now these guys have each gained either 100 yards rushing as in the case of James Plus 104 Harrison and that would equal Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin who had similar days or nights on Toyotas in addition to two triplets you know they have Reggie Wayne on that other side so if you want to do something and you don't take away the run and then you want to take away Marvin Harrison he still has some other guys that can really get you quadruplets they're on their way to Eaton though they're two minutes from a perfect mark at midseason their 11th straight game football team as Tony Dungy steam tries to stay undefeated but ain't no and they will do that and that augurs well for the future as we said before the cults will not have to think about making a return visit to New England not this year not in the playoffs they would lead by four in the AFC standings that have a game in hand so maybe they would meet but it would be in Indianapolis third down for Roosevelt Colvin I don't think I'd be throwing the ball out there to Marvin Harrison in this situation in the game to let him swing him down yeah I think that yeah he's done his job and I just let the guy go sit down or just stand out there as a decoy or something he looks like he may be thinking to say okay what the heck was that Hunter Smith will come in and that's news stop the presses he didn't pawn wall last week he had won the game before that and this will be his first punt of the night almost 59 minutes into the game and Tim Dwight will bring it out to the 47 yard line perfect and you know that he's going to say all the right things whatever it is but they could just point into his back then he just got something off right where he was pointing yes he did Godzilla from the 46 and in the game is Doug Flutie the oldest player in the league at the age of 43 so Flutie will finish up Doug who first appeared on Monday Night Football in 1986 as a Chicago Bear I remember that and you know who would have thought when he first started as a Chicago Bear that all these years later he'd still be in the lake you go back to his college days up the road at Boston College bastard slipped out of his hand I'm sure people are going wait a minute doug flutie he's the backup quarterback annoying and they were saying was heck did he just do that he got tetanus through a screen fast with a with a jump on it jump fast screen fast lady last year in San Diego Belichick brings brings them in here Bill's gonna watch him stealing go back to the locker room with a record of four and four and that pattern continues news from opening day forward these basses incomplete Roy Brown couldn't hold on and it's fourth down and you know it's just kind of a you know a patchwork defense for him now and he doesn't have that you know that that that's strong I mean even even when you know he lost his corners last year he still had Rodney Harrison in there who was was kind of the glue and this year he lost the glue so forth and ten at the 46yard line that's more than that remove the chains Troy Brown course going forward there is so much air time to film so much newspaper space to fill so people will begin to talk about the cults of course and until they get beaten can they duplicate what Miami did in 1972 and then the other thing will start to be talked about it since the JA answer section to these patreon against thee live in Detroit in February that's already being talked about I was in New York last week and I already heard that one and you know that's not farfetched I mean if you would have said that two months ago you'd say oh no that's crazy that's farfetched but right now the way the Giants are playing and obviously the way the Colts are playing that's that's not a weird idea hot side 90 defense a neutral zone infraction well it sets up with the the second half of the season off the top of your head biggest surprise of the first half of the season at this point I don't know I would I would probably say the team we were just talking about the Giants I mean that's that's probably and you know Peyton's brother Eli doing so well this could be an undefeated as a surprise the NFC's the loafing last place in the NFC s 33 seconds time and here the Flutey is trying to draw a foul let's throw a basketball thing is that where a guy runs into a guy and then falls off and puts his hands up like that well Doc Rivers was here earlier tonight but he left to beat the traffic of those we could have asked him about I was just looking over there to see if Doc we're still here where I can ask him if that was taking a foul backs back in his apartment by now watch him here it's where he tries to take the followup he has the whole thing he bounced turning around put both hands up pointed to the official that everything to get that file and be an easy guy to foul and stuck in the charge the end zone that's incomplete Tim Dwight the intended receiver as we wind it down so the Colts are eight No Cincinnati's won seven games they haven't had their buy yet Bengals are are seven and two and then the team for six wins would be Pittsburgh Denver the Giants Atlanta Carolina and Seattle you know most of those even Cincinnati you could kind of see coming the Giants reason I say they are surprised I didn't see that one coming I mean you thought Philadelphia would still be there maybe Dallas would be better this year maybe the Redskins DeMatha Giants and that should write a finish to this one and so the Indianapolis Colts who haven't won here in a decade it's been a house of horrors for Peyton Manning don't you wonder what they're doing here yeah this this games over put it to bed yeah well it's the he turned over as Robert Mathis gets their Mathis he's gonna wind up with a sack so of all things by running that extra play Mathis keeps his streak alive of having a sack in every game this season he'll get one there Peyton Manning will get some congratulations as he heads back and it will be a very happy flight back to Indianapolis now you say what does this game mean what is me looking faint and manning a look at Tom Brady it does the 11th team are the coats just don't eight and Oh since the 72 dolphins who of course went 40 nano and then won all three postseason games autotrader.com postgame show coming up next welcome to the autotrader.com postgame show now Al Michaels the mustsee game of the season and Indianapolis dominates to win at 42 21 they get off to a hot start on the first drive of the game as Marvin Harrison hauls that one in to make it 7 to nothing but New England answered on its first drive as branch makes the catch here for a touchdown 7 all it was 147 at this point when Reggie Wayne caught that ball to make it 217 and that was the halftime score Dominique grows then went into the end zone for the 4th Colt touchdown of the game to make it 28 to 7 New England showing life here Graham on a screen taking it into the 28:14 but then Patriots final onside kick that didn't work it was a 17 point game Brown was able to score here but too little and too late as Peyton Manning has a big night 28 on the 37 for 321 yards three touchdowns he finally wins in New England Harrison with two touchdown receptions tonight and Peyton Manning goes up on to the horse trailer as our player of the game that Colt on the horse river Peyton's with Sam Ryan alright now Peyton Manning congratulations your first win here in New England now you get over the socalled hump john madden was saying before the game he saw you and you just seemed so focused more focus than he has ever seen you how do you sum up just what this one means well we had a good week of practice we were really focused on a couple of things coming in tonight really to get off to a good start we haven't had to lead on these guys in quite some time so we really did a good job with hitting a big plate of Marvin early and sort of setting the tempo and her defense fed off that and just really didn't have to punt all night just one time they stopped ourselves a couple times but just could overall the execution feels good to get the win coming off the bye week but Peyton this one was your face out there your face on the cover of Sports Illustrated they dubbed this this was this was Manning against Brady how personal is this one for you well it's like those Dunn's you said all we are is eight no this is not a playoff game and we're excited about the win because we're still undefeated and it feels good to be undefeated we're gonna try to keep this going and we'll probably see these guys again these guys are always in it in the end and so it feels good to get the win hopefully we can use this and carry it over the rest of the season a coach Dungy was telling us yesterday he wanted to downplay
