============================================================

welcome to the Superdome in New Orleans for the 1989 Sugar Bowl between the Florida State Seminoles and the Auburn Tigers let's join our announcers as they get set for the opening kickoff right here on ESPN Classic and so the Superdome in New Orleans fill the capacity about 75,000 to look on Bobby Bowden on the left and what a tremendous job he has done in Florida State turning their football program into a powerhouse program and on the right Pat dye who played at Georgia he was a teammate there in the early 50s of Fran Tarkenton and then began his coaching career as an assistant on Bear Bryant staff at Alabama came to Auburn in 1981 and takes his team as does Bowden to a seventh consecutive bowl game I see both of them though al were not following in the footsteps of the bear both of them wearing hats inside the Superdome didn't Bear Bryant once say I'm not going to wear a hat my mama told me never to wear a hat when I was indoor he filed the old houndstooth cap away whenever he came in for Auburn Chris Johnson will be kicking off the Auburn Tigers were Co champions of the Southeastern Conference they shared that title with Louisiana State and it's up to the Sugar Bowl committee to decide where it hit the head it would be LSU here but normally the committee opts to go with the higher rated team and thus it is Auburn with and in 1 over Walmart and you'll hear the chant War Eagle from the Auburn Packers why are to stay to receive and at the goal line that's Dexter Carter a backup tailback at the 15yard tackle is made by Daryl Crawford and working the sidelines tonight is Lynn Swann Lynn Thank You al before the games try that talk with both coaches about what they tell their teams in the locker room Pat dye said he tell us team there are no miracle speeches to help you win but if you play with determination and the class you've had all year you'll be okay Bobby Bowden said if they win tonight it could make up for the gloss they had to Miami where they were the sacrificial lamb losing by 31 so this game could make Florida State season al al if you tell him that we lost to Michigan not yet from the 16 yard line this is Sammy Smith picking up five as he takes it out to the 21 yard line and smokey Hodge is in on the stop Sammy Smith has had a disappointing season and we'll take a look at the Florida State offense chip Ferguson is the quarterback Smith is the tailback back of the fullback Williams Dorsey starts along with Anthony and O'Malley is the tight end Ronald Lewis would normally start but he has a pulled hamstring and there's their offensive line joy a threeyear starter at strong tackle and Pat Cumberland the excellent opposite number at the other tackle spot from the 21 yard line on 2nd and 5 at Smith through about the 24 and it will be third down and 2 for Florida State now we'll look at the Auburn defense and they've given up an average of only 7 points a game all of those men are allconference rocker of course is the Outland and Lombardi Trophy winner the four linebackers and they don't get the publicity because of the three guys up front but they've done a great job and the Auburn secondary and you hate to call these guys the weak link but if you can do anything on Auburn or if their opponents have been able to do anything this season it's been basically through the air certainly not on the ground but FSU stays on the ground and Smith on his third carry picks up a first down so Florida State running right into Auburn strength Harvard of course the number one team defensively in the nation collegiate Lee and Sammy Smith through he did have an off season he was a Heisman candidate coming in got off to a slow start shoulder injury rib injuries but the last five games he's put together over 500 yards of rushing and he is capable on a given night to really pile it up he had 212 yards against Tulane alone I think you have to look at that average Frank over five yards a carry here's the play fake and Ferguson will keep it dances up to the 37 yard line for a gain of about 8 John Wiley runs him out of bounds at that spot good athlete Ferguson took a look inside saw nothing was happening there broke it to the outside and came up close to the first down we not only have a matchup here of two outstanding teams talent wise but I'm intrigued by the matchup of the two coaches Pat dye who's really extremely conservative likes to play it close to the vest of course when he has a defense like he has it's easier to do that in his counterpart Bobby Bowden maybe one of the most outlandish coaches in the country as far as what he'll call where he'll call it on the field I a great matchup of coach and on second and 2 here is Smith after the 43 and the interesting thing here Dan of the outset is that they're running counter or at least Bowden is because he begins with a very conservative but effective attack and backtoback first downs can you talk to him he's like a medicine man really there he is very colorful and he is a fine football coach 1987 he took this Florida State team up against Auburn and he really trimmed them 34 to 6 and he did it by running trap plays when all operand was thinking run he passed the ball a lot and he always is coming up with a gimme play you have to watch him all the time with the gimme plays at the 43 first and 10 Florida State the fake to Smith Ferguson protected well throws and it's dropped at the 45 yard line and you don't see that often Terri Anthony dropping it Florida State with four receivers known as the fabulous four but one of it for some was not so fabulous right here Terry Anthony 1695 pounds he was there and the ball was right in there with him John Shan Morris up there defensively that's the son of a former great Chicago Bear I know you know Dan Larry Morrison was here watching tonight that is a pass that Anthony just has to bring down because you wonder is Ferguson going to get that kind of protection all night long there was a nun Auburn defensive lineman within three yards of Ferguson we threw the ball on second and ten Ferguson rolling throwing and 245 attaches main for a first down by Anthony so he drops one comes right back and makes the reception in Florida State begins with three consecutive first down but again look at the play calling we had a sprint out the other direction by Ferguson this time he breaks contained moving to his right they were effective running the ball Terry Anthony just a simple curl up pattern goes down for the ball but I like the way that Florida State is running their offense they established the run three straight carries by Smith then roll out see the direction and it's working for them first down at the Auburn 45 in a nice hole for Smith a fourth straight first down to the 33yard line and again keep in mind it's the number one rushing defense in the country number one in scoring averaging only seven points a game against them and Florida State coming out very effectively on this first series watch the double team right upfront Heyward Haynes the left guard just seals off the middle blocking down on the nose tackle Benji Rowland and then Sammy Smith who a lot of people look at as a speed back but keep in mind this guy's 225 pounds and a good illustration there that along with that speed Smith has power to go with it about 10 3 for the 100 meters for heat that is smoking I thought he was going to be a bo Jackson type and he is just about the same dimensions and he is the same kind of speed meanwhile about the only way that Auburn could stop Florida State right here is for Florida State to call the timeout and that's what they do as they're marching down the field but as Ferguson looked over the defense he takes a timeout with three minutes and 16 seconds having elapsed in the first quarter kind of stunning isn't we've talked about the great defense of Auburn and Florida State us come out called the right plays executed the right plays with the quarterback Jim Ferguson today a move on the ground and in the air it gets offered if your pet died coach of the Auburn Tigers you've got the matchup you want it in a big game you always would like to have your defense especially if it's a stellar defense out on the field first and that's exactly what dime and a lot of times the offensive team comes out a little bit tight you'll see that three plays and punt you open up the game with good field position this is really worked in Florida State's favor getting the ball and moving it against an outstanding unit they've already run e plays and Smith is Perry five times Michigan of course beat USC in the Rose Bowl a great game at Pasadena 22 to 14 Notre Dame will win a national championship 17 to 3 and here we're just underway no score early first quarter Florida State moving against Auburn from the 33 this passes to the outside a beautiful move and a first down of the 16 yard line stopped by Shane Morris Frank here we are back to some things that cannot be coached this is a play that may be a Smith would have just closed his eyes and banged it in there might have picked up a yard it might have just ended up a NetZero at the line of scrimmage this is nothing more than instinctive running seeing it bottled up inside and then it's all Sammy Smith Frank watching plant this left foot and he just accelerates out of it like the great backs do and that what do you think of when you watch that I think of Eric Dickerson the same time to move the same kind of speed from the 16 yard line the fake by Ferguson and the pass is caught and close to a first down and I think Tom O'Mally has it as he wrestles his way down on the six yard line a beautiful fake by Ferguson who is a great ball handler and first and goal at the 6 yard line nothing more than the formation and firt watch the fake here both backs are going to move to the left the fake by Ferguson and then watch him come out with the football this this really gets everyone in a blue jersey to bite notice how Ferguson turned his back to the play completely the easy completion again to play calling about McKee this is Schmidt and he fights his way out of the backfield and across the five to the three it's a redshirt senior Sammy Smith who's going to have to make a decision whether he is going to stay on another year at Florida State or will he go to the professionals there's little doubt if he stays healthy that he would be one of the fine running backs of professional football that's been the only problem with him he had 1200 plus yardage yards as a junior and he just was injured early in the year but this is a great running back Bobby Bowden said yesterday in terms of that decision if he listens to his mama he'll be back in school mama and Bobby yes ii and goalie of a penalty flag and sniff his tackle that about the line of scrimmage by greg staples and we had the game's first penalty better believe Bobby's talking to mommy also I think it's safe to say that mama is echoing Bobby Bowden's sentiments as well both sides on the defense John Sophie from Albany New York who's our referee tonight the penalty is against Auburn and Pat dye looking on watching his defense giving up the type of Drive that he has not seen very often this year in fact their first unit defense allowed only four touchdowns all year for in 11 games they never gave up a 100yard rushing game to an SEC opponent all year either if the looks for this first drive by Florida State we better quit talking about that stuff right away yeah this unit on his drive has not played well enough to warrant our we've been programmed time to turn the page the chapter drive is five minutes old it is second and goal at the to Florida State and the up back the pullback Williams takes it in for the touchdown classic drive a little bit of everything and look at the way the Auburn defense is getting up just looking around named William hutches it ends bobby bowden told us yesterday this guy reminds him of a Nebraska fullback he's primarily a blocker only 251 yards on the year but when I was good power running soldiers Oh again the beneficiary is a good line blocking the credit a great deal of his success on his drive the Florida State's offensive line earlier today many of you may have seen that game on ABC form Orlando Clemson held on to beat Oklahoma with the Sooners driving at the end but Clemson wins by 7 and in Tampa Syracuse to beat LSU and the LSU Tigers for the only team to defeat lover this season the Orangemen win it by a score of 23 to 10 and of course so we told you about the Rose ball and a little bit later on there will be a minor debt to be paid off Kairi i think i'm setting some sort of a record for humility you are you haven't mentioned it to once to see how long I could go without first time I've got a dear dear smile on my face and you're humming hail to the victors valiant outside of that nothing kick taken at the three and he brings it back out to the 23 yard line we'll offer and begin its first drive the tackle is made by Brian Davis and here comes Reggie slack to guide the Auburn offense at the 24 yard line junior recruited out of Milton Florida and with Reggie he's got James Joseph whom started the season as the tailback now the fullback and Dan Lee is the primary running back Tillman and weygand a couple of very good receivers and Walter Reeves an excellent tight end Jim Thompson one of the best in the country and Ed King an outstanding freshman to the 30yard line at Stacey Dan Lee for a gain of about seven making a second and three Wireless they depend so much made about their offensive prowess but defensively they've done the job rather well this year he gives in the middle it's a threeman front none of the names really stand out but it's a very cohesive unit Thompson Hayes Smith and Hadley of the linebackers those Sanders are unrelated dianna forces the allamerican and figures to be a very high draft choice this is deadly and he runs right into big number 36 the linebacker killed in Smith who meets him at the line of scrimmage and pushes him back down Calvin Smith is the best of that line back in Crewe he's a sophomore they're going to get a lot more out of because this is one violent collision right here boy he just shoots the gap works inside between the right guard and the right tackle and an excellent job of breeding it namely has absolutely no opportunity even make it back to the line of scrimmage a lot of pressure now in the Auburn offense their defense is reeling a bit they'd really help themselves out to get a couple first down third and five from the 29 yard line and it's intercepted at the 44yard line by staying shy ver and he takes it back to the 33 and this game for Florida State beginning similarly as flags go down there's a scuffle after the interception last year turnovers Dean Auburn in against Florida State including an interception early on by stay in Scheiber I win of course wound up thirty four to six Florida State won six turnovers I believe it was but it was a nightmare where Pat died and this is not shaping up too well it's a dead ball foul it's a personal foul on Auburn and so the interception of course stands because it's a dead ball foul and they'll march off 15 more but here's what something on this play this is Stacey danly right here who's going to run an out pattern I want you to watch him as we roll the tape because this is where Reggie slack should have gone with a football he makes a poor decision look at Dan Lee how wideopen he is and Dan Lee goes downfield and throws right in to the teeth of the coverage Florida State made a mistake family was wide open and slack didn't see it never saw Stan Chivers so they're slack and next to him is Pat Sullivan who's the offensive assistant he coaches the quarterbacks Pat the 1971 Heisman Trophy winner is the Auburn quarterback and what he's saying to the young quarterback let's just settle down now the junior quarterback that's okay we'll get another shot out well remember one of the things Pat died told us yesterday about Reggie slack it was that nothing seems to bother him reminded Pat died a little bit of the snake Kenny Stabler when he was pama no matter what happened he never got flustered flex going to need it now and the defense will have to step in now is Ferguson pitch number 80 just in the tightend for a first down and it will be first and goal they'll spot the ball at the three yard line but it may be coming back there's a flag down to the 24 yard line it will come back boy did Reggie Johnson lower his shoulder at the end of that run or what holding on the offense 10yard penalty still first down instead of first and goal it will now be first and 20 now what think before the state has established run and watch this now is where we're talking about a moment ago Reggie Johnson John Wiley number nine his six comes up and tries to put the lick on Reggie Johnson and whoa on first and 20 now it's Smith moving to the outside and taking you to the 26 yard line Farlow Cheatham comes up to make the tackle after a pickup of about three the Florida State having established they can run the ball as they did in that first series so easily they basically were thought to be a team that would come in and throwing the ball against the defensive unit against the run by Auburn now they can start to think a lot of different things they can think play fast Auburn's got to be just a little bit confused they got a consider run as we look at their Outland Trophy winner Tracy rocker they'll be a little hesitant because they know the Florida State can now run it second and 17 is Ferguson some Lawrence dossie and dashi is taken down at the 20yard line it will be third down and 12 Morris and Wiley converge on the tackle watch the way Florida State all their receivers and running backs finish off their play they get the football and then everything is going forward shoulders down aggressively fighting for another two feet an extra yard or whatever this is an aggressive football team offensively you hear a lot about it's always the defensive guy that does all the hitting look at the way Florida State offensively has been hitting the last two or three plays and did you see those numbers on Gauci 18 cashes during the regular season nine two touchdown third and 11 and is stopped after a gain of 1 by Benji Rowland and that's not unusual Bobby Bowden was saying yesterday we like to run off times on third and long they run here but to no avail and the field goal unit will come in they will now see one of a selection of field goal kickers has Florida State you know we've seen some imaginative play calling by Bobby bow and this is the first play all day long that was less than that third and 11 just challenging this auburn defense right where they are the strongest right up the middle I don't care how much success you've had on 3rd and 11 that's a tough call bill Mason comes in to attempt a 36yard field goal and the kick is good they have a medium range but they have one for the extra points in New Orleans Al Michaels with Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf and Lynn Swann we talked about over his defense there it is for the season they averaged yielding 218 yards a game tonight already 119 in the first quarter the yield an average of 7 points a game already tonight 10 they led the nation in rushing defense 63 yards a game tonight thanks mainly to Sammy Smith 71 yards after 15 minutes one would surmise if these stats continue that Auburn may not win the game one might surmise their second and seven Ferguson and he dumps it off any fine Dexter Carter and Carter fights his way to the 25yard line absorbing some hits he's finally stopped by smokey Hodge and he first down Bobby Bowden said that Dexter Carter might play a major role tonight he is a very versatile back good running back and also a fine receiver out of the backfield that pass from Ferguson didn't look like much more or less a dying quail as it came in over the top but that's the touch he needed on it it only had to travel about eight or nine yards and Ferguson want the extra time getting out of the pocket and Carter stayed alive and Carter bulld his way for the extra yardage the ball is if it's 25 on first down Ferguson its partner again and farther picks up seven as he's taken down by John Wiley at the 18 yard line opening minute of the second quarter and nothing Florida State and there is the Auburn mascot War Eagle that is not a hawk that is not crow a crow that is not anything else that is the War Eagle not a groundhog either you know the name is a tiger there's quite a story that goes with this eagle I'm sure that we're going to get around to a little later on no but the Seminoles right now are what counts they are in control this ball game second and three harder again to the chain yard so as they rest Smith who had the sensational first quarter he is spelled by Carter and Carter comes out looking like Sammy Smith that's what Bobby Bowden said about him we've sent him running the football we've seen him on the receiving end of it and here is Tracy rocker the Outland Trophy winner and most certainly a high firstround draft pick in the pro at that time they blew him out of there Pat Cumberland need allamerican offensive tackle for Florida State working over that right side well there's nothing that an offensive lineman enjoys more than a lead and right now that's a luxury that the Florida State offensive line is enjoying they better get this play off in Ferguson seeing that he's not going to do it asked to call a timeout they were down to two seconds on the 25 second clock Bobby Bowden the native of Alabama he enrolled at the University of Alabama as a freshman and then transferred to Howard University now Sanford and his son is the current head coach at Stanford Tommy the head coach at FSU they lead 10 first and goal just inside the 10 and Dexter Carter makes it to the floor but a marker is down at the 9 yard line smokey Hodge makes the tackle and our referee John Sophie will tell us illegal chef we have two men moving at the same time well Bowden likes to use a lot of trick plays works fine in Canada but not here where Bobby was getting the word from upstairs as the who was the guilty party Communications have improved greatly on the collegiate level back in the old days you didn't get chewed out until the next day when they sat down and watched a film now it's instantaneous sometimes a replay on it right in front of all of America first and goal at the 15yard line Florida State with the ball Laverne has turned it over three times and the Seminoles lead 10 to nothing on a draw they give it to Dean Williams he's the man who scored the touchdown to culminate that early drive and he takes it to about the 12 it'll be second and goal dane williams is very close to coming out of that pile at the line of scrimmage and maybe having a clear ally to the goal line draw plays were a very effective in florida state win in 1987 and we talked to Pat dye yesterday said he has gone back several times and looked at the films it's obvious that Bobby Bowden has also gone back because it was a very effective play against Auburn in 87 and he's seen it several times the night on 2nd and goal Williams takes issue about the 9 yard line it'll now be third and goal for Florida State well I don't know how far down this Auburn defense can reach but now is the time to do it they have been put in an awkward position the entire first quarter and now into the second quarter but this is a group that has been there before and over the course of a season when you only allow seven points the game there is a tremendous camaraderie and pride that has built up and now is the time for that to surface because a touchdown here just might be fatal keiki play third and goal Ferguson had time and then runs out of it Tracy rocker gets the sack at the 14 yard line well we talked about all these guys up front being all SEC and allamericans but that's a coverage sack that's a sack where there's nobody to throw true there is late penetration by the defensive line right here Ferguson looking into the end zone looking for the back out of the backfield Carter and Terry Anthony rocker was even nailed at the line of scrimmage got up but you're right good coverage and it forces the field goal team onto the field 31 yard attempt imation after the previous state and the kick is good so in a way a small victory of sorts for Auburn ear limiting them to three and staying within two touchdowns 13 to nothing Florida State some Auburn fans and they're used to coming to New Orleans because the Tigers played in the Sugar Bowl a year ago in the I guess you'd call the infamous 1616 tie against Syracuse now you wonder how many people in upstate New York aren't enjoying what's happening to the Auburn Tigers right now a lot of bitter feelings after that time passed I elected to go for a field goal at the end of the and this is Dan Li breaking one for about ten and close to a first down as he gets to the 42 Eric Hayes in on the tackle he blocked by James Joseph who came back in at fullback to spring Dan Lee line blocked by Joseph lead back but story would hurt al about Pat died what the Syracuse people sent a thousand ties down to Pat died the head coach of Auburn and he turned around sold them he sold him and they the proceeds went to charity or actually went I believe to the scholarship fund at Harper that's hardly charity just bad guys mine it is second and inches with those inches in several yards as he takes it to the 32 he is stopped by Butler first down Tigers we talked about his being a need the mayor Brian any took his first head coaching job in the late 70s at East Carolina went to Wyoming one year there he would have stayed longer except the Auburn job opened up they offered it to him and obviously he had to take it at that point in his career Joseph at the 24 yard line that time Joseph got a key block from Dan Lee a super block by Dan Lee and these two are almost interchangeable both of them can play that tailback spot switching around and it was Dan Lee with a terrific block how about the end of that play though where Joseph ends up on Cory and Freeman maybe the world's largest quarterback for Florida State this guy's 225 pounds six for playing corner areas number ten and number ten met number ten at the end of that last play second in a long yard closer to here's Joseph and he takes it to the 22 yard line I would say from our perspective here he is just short of the of a first down meanwhile if you you're just picking us up along the way 13 to nothing Florida State Auburn turn the ball over three times on their first three possessions and Auburn now has mounted a drive and as they measure here Auburn trying to keep the drive alive and trying very much to stay in the game and their defense has stiffened the last two times Florida State has held the ball to keep them in the game just short third down a coming Bend good work in the fighterbomber and to stay in this because they could have really been blown out of this early on that guy was talking to his team both offensively and defensively as they came off on those first three series and they had stayed in the game they got that much for the first down to keep this drive alive they get it on get the conversion and they're right back into a game in which they were being blown away in the first quarter really very much the same scenario as when these two teams met last year Auburn made all the mistakes early Florida State Capitol on 3rd and inches out of the power I and those are going to be some hardearned inches Vincent Harris running right into Kelvin Smith and let's see where they marked at forward progress Shelvin Smith plays that play exactly like you have to you gotta meet it in the air we're gonna stop it they'll measure again I think he's got it here's the key watch the two inside linebackers right here they have to get over the top and meet the ball carrier just watch calvin smith and Felton hayes how they get up in the air and they make contact on the auburn side of the football with vincent harris credits smith and Hayes it's still a first down but that is technically perfect the way you play short yardage if you're an inside linebacker and it's not all that easy to time it out no it's not and Vincent Harris frankly I think was the beneficiary of a very good spot I didn't even see him getting back to the line of scrimmage neither did Bobby Bob no no Smith and Hayes were clearly on the offered side of the football when they initiated content first down from the 22 Stanley seeking the hole and it opens for a gain of two to the 20 yard line with 455 to go in the first half for a senior who was a freshman takes the tackle I guess the announcer shall have fun with him over the next four years I say even he's gone to the shades that are sweeping the NFL everyone with their dark visor I you know it really does make a lot of sense when you consider Frank you played all those years so did I how many times you'd see a teammate get poked in the eye if you keep someone from getting a finger in the eye well worthwhile second and nine from the 21 yard line that's putting weygand in motion they cost black going for the five and in for the touchdown all the way by Reggie slack into the line of scrimmage on Saunders bought it to him he held everyone on Florida State and Sanders the guy who ends up having to have the coverage on Reeves is woefully out of it win while for the extra points Schulman holdings they take his gun and the Tigers are very much back in the game well for Florida State earlier and now is this game is the new football game Auburn all fired up it all starts here with a fake into the line of scrimmage the fake pitch and Reggie slack so everyone on Florida State you have to wonder where's the contain and walk to reach and really just ran a simple out better school Seder sauce and and come back into the shot he had bought the fake all the way in a very competitive ball player sometimes he over plays different plays and that's exactly what he then here he bought the blame and went to Brian be on the other side of the field to help out he got back way touchdown Auburn Walter Reeves just gave Sanders a ride into the end of us F and G sugar bowl we get set to start the second half fat dies Auburn Tigers Bobby Bowden's Florida State Seminoles hey let's get a word from Lynn Swann thank you I talked to Palace he came out to the field for the second half and he said he feels like a winner Florida State got a little greedy trying to fake the field goal and go for the touchdown so he feels like he's right in this ball game that the first half his team was uncharacteristic couple of seniors could have been out of the game for late hits he had Mohnish them and encouraged his team to come back out in the second half play the kind of football they played all year long and he feels he'll get right back on top of this ball game early I agree with him absolutely held them together in that first quarter and that could have been a disaster none man to be around isn't he talk very slowly little overshadowed a little bit by Bobby thousand where they get together found a very flamboyant coach outspoken in every way fast and I as we look at Bobby bond whether or not he'd ever considered maybe going to professional football remark was well that's the only place I would ever go I could never go to another college and leave Auburn second half starts with Shane Wasden taking it from the three all the way out to the 33 sooner later he is going to break one Wasden now has been one man away a couple of times he really zips it he is just about popped a couple of them when you look at those four turnovers on the lower right column of Auburn I think you know what Lin salon was saying what Pat dye said that it does feel like a victory when you turn it over four times and you go into the locker room at halftime only down by six points that is a victory first and ten tigers from the 32 yard line and family stopped for no game second down and 10 the middle of that Florida State line and also the linebacker Filton Hayes plugging the gap number 46 well the two leading tacklers for Florida State are their two inside linebackers Felton Hayes being their number two tackler is teammate back there Kelvin Smith they're number one guy and they are certainly the key to trying to make anything happen against Florida State on the ground there's Auburn fourth over the last five seasons as the catch is made by Greg Taylor out at the 37 yard line you can make that the last six seasons as you saw that graphic and the success of Pat dye has had with the Auburn Tigers who are in their seventh consecutive bowl game as are the Seminoles of Florida State we look at Taylor and in weygand and I guess the question you have to ask offensively where's lawyer Tillman has not been a part of this game at all for Auburn they're big play wide receiver third down five from the 37 and slack tried to throw it away I think he tried to shovel passion and it appears they're going to rule it a fumble and Auburn recovers Shelton Thompson was there Eric Hayes put the pressure on I think slack was trying to shovel a forward pass where there was nobody in front of him though I'll accept his offensive linemen III I were gonna have to look at that up close but there was no one anywhere near him I don't think that was an eligible receiver one thing we do know for certain they got a big break out of it Brian julen who's the best in the Southeastern Conference his first pick of the night Deion Sanders makes the catch but Steve do anything with it the nation's leading punt returner is out of bounds at the 31 here's that play again watch Reggie slack he's going to end up having to move to his right to get away from the pass rush coming from the backside you get a good look at the pressure the chase is a mouse Howard Dinkins was a guy and that's you know that's a bubble that's just a fumble all the way in Auburn was extremely fortunate to cover up that ball and on top of it they get a sensational kick the difference from the outside Eric Hayes up the middle what a job Shulman is doing keeping that ball away from Deion Sanders black got lucky very nearly v over in turnover and said they're able to puck and Ferguson escaping the pressure hit Smith the flag is down sandy Smith down the sideline he will go all the way 22 yard line and this one comes you got a look at that ten 3speed for the 100 meters by Sammy Smith this man is big and he really kicked the motor in a couple of our players had a good angle on him and he just spread it away from them even though they bring him back what an awesome offensive force he is in trouble with ribs and shoulder early on this season after a sensational junior year coming into tonight a little over 600 yards rushing holding on the offense ten yards first out guilty Florida State Holder I think it's Ron Stallworth number 92 the Auburn player you see him there to the left that forces the hold Stallworth with that pursuit from the backside I think through the holding penalty and Wow look at this is just like a sprinter look at that stride arms pumping that is open field acceleration first and 20 is the end result from the 21 yard line partner and he's brought down from behind by Tracy rocker who's been relatively quiet again rocker 1 the Outland Trophy which goes to the best lineman in the country and the Lombardi Trophy which also includes linebackers and this is steel on steel this is Tracy rocker going against Pat tomerlin the allamerican tackle for Florida State and it was a stalemate of the line of scrimmage but then rocker doing what he does so well pursue laterally makes the play Cumberland 300plus pounds isn't everybody isn't everybody on the offensive line these days easy for you to say second and 18 Ferguson incomplete intended for tossing third and 18 I mean there if you are a 260 pound offensive lineman in college you've got a ways to go if you want to play in the NFL you better start pumping the iron here comes rocker again fighting off to people here is the Florida State offensive line as you can see they get bigger as you go towards the bottom that's bigger than Denver Hayward Hanes at 278 and tomerlin at 3 bills plus and tomerlin a definite pro prospect you play in the NFL for long time will rocker third and 18 in Florida state as they approach to do running on third and long a fumble but the Seminoles recover Carter gave it up and then Dean Williams alert he was there to keep possession for the Seminoles and enable them to punt and Joey Ayanna covered it up I can't leave beans doing a little bit of tradeoff here augering fumbles on third down recovers now Florida State fumbles on third down and recovers to set up a bunt we're seeing the defense from Auburn that we anticipated when we came here they have really shut for to stay down Jane was been back to accept the kick at the 37 yard line he brings it back to the 44 so a short shift by Tim Coral ooh and a 7 yard run back and Auburn with the football at the 44 yard line back at the Superdome still patrolling the sidelines is Lynn Swann thank you very much I'm with two cheerleaders for the Seminoles Allyson is the older one and this is Lauren how long has Lauren been doing this for you and when you cheer for the Seminoles what do you say okay thank you and they're doing a good job so far aren't they you're going to be a cheerleader when you grow up just like here thank you guys this is the best job in the house got a red shirt her bring her back Seminoles avid at the 14 yard line little sauce is Smith swinging to the outside breaks the tackle and fights his way out for a gain of 7 finally stop by Alvin Mitchell a lot of pro scouts looking on tonight well several of them here and they are seeing a class performance of total potential yeah and this man how did he get outside that's 7 yards that is nothing but the ability to have that has that speed that can get around that corner break that play looked like nothing when it started to unfold great ones they're big and like dickerson you never miss you've never can calculate their speed they're so big they do not look like they're moving that quickly as Sammy Smith is and he has out rush Auburn tonight pick up a couple more and he's close to a first down he takes it to the 24 yard line Sammy has now picked up 84 yards tonight which is significant because Auburn has not yield at a hundred yard game since 86 when Bobbie Humphrey did it for Alabama against the Tigers Florida State trying to go back to what was effective for them in the opening moments of the game they were able to move the ball so well on the ground Auburn has shut them down pretty much here in the second half well in Florida State has shut themselves down as well remember Sammy Smith scores a touchdown on a play that gets called back because of a holding that would have made this a 22 7 ballgame and really a great deal more pressure on Auburn than they than they currently have a first down New Year's Eve all over again for the Seminoles but there's nothing like New Year's Eve one street corner the other night we saw a guy dressed as a coyote another is an ad another was a mackerel another is a seal there was one of his best of the canoe unbelievable you're not kidding from the 24 yard line the catch is made by the tight end Tom O'Mally and a first down at the 45 Malley is big he went up like a kangaroo to get that coming down right at near midfield from Ally is from Darien Connecticut his way to Florida State his family's here I was talking with him earlier there he is number 92 a senior six foot three and it gets the first down that close to the 44 yard line you kind of get the impression that O'Malley wasn't supposed to be a starter a tight end wearing number 92 you kind of give those numbers the guys you don't expect to be on the field very often from the 44 yard line Ferguson throws is the catch made no a late ruling no Lawrence LA she doesn't hold on Carlos Edom was the guy making the ruling the Harvard defensive back you could all see him in there waving his arms no catch no catch and the officials bought it Bobby Bowden obviously didn't see it the same way well let's see what we can see from behind you see them ball is kind of dropping but again a sensational throw by Ferguson and a sensational catch he had the ball or I don't see the ball hitting the ground I don't see the ball hitting the ground at all I can I can sympathize with Bobby Bowden looked like a catch from behind without had a good view of a sensational catch second and 10 and Smith planks is way for 9 to the 47 of Auburn you know as we watch this game and as we follow Florida State offensively at the conclusion of the game tonight Jim Ferguson's numbers aren't going to correspond with actually how good of a game he played I think he's thrown the ball past solutely he's fabulously tonight and hasn't had a great deal of help from system from his supporting cast the last drive we saw three consecutive drops right into the receivers hands I think Ferguson excited to write big sharp third and one from the 47 and they give it to Marian butts in the 248 pounds pullback as a first down taking it to the 41 and again you saw that graphic illustrating what we discussed before wall burn not allowing a hundredyard game to a running back since Humphrey in 1986 finish for Alabama 24 games with sandy Smith is on the birds tonight did you see Gregg staples the defensive back for Auburn he came up and he put a shot on butts and he drove him back give him credit for that but boy he wounded himself in the process staples remains in the game but he's he's not himself from the 41 Furguson and another drop and a classic example right there through the hands of Tom O'Mally so Ferguson about 90% of the time tonight right on the money but his completion percentage far for our Lord that'll be nearly a half a dozen or so that have been dropped and again good protection Ferguson with a lot of times though he's had that most of the night but you can't throw it a whole lot better than that no you can't no guy who's going right to the defendant got a linebacker on his hip O'Malley is there has the ball alright they're in but he's 11 for 21 he could easily be 17 or 18 for 21 agreed 2nd and 10 from the 41 yard line they at the 26yard line Anthony holds on so finally they hold on and also give a lot of credit on Auburn when the Florida State offensive line again Ferguson with a lot of times he went back too fast and a nifty pass by Ferguson high percentage on the year and this was thrown into a crowd of a swollen exactly where it had to be for Anthony to come down with fifth concentration by Anthony but a well delivered football by chip Berger well the ones we've seen dropped they were all easier than that one the one that was thought was the most difficult catch of all maybe a concentrate more at the 26 ma'am and that should take him over a hundred as he takes it to the 19 yard line Sammy Smith when the season began they were touting him for the Heisman he came up way way short of course and we've got an Auburn player down out there out back at the 10yard line Carlo cheeto a cornerback the left corner sedum was away from the play a good 15 20 yards away from where Sammy Smith goes out of bounds let's see if we can see it he's going oneonone with Terry Anthony oh and there's a good look at it right there Anthony making the block on a running play Cheatham tries to jump over the top of Anthony when he comes back down plants his foot and it gets rolled right up on by Gerry Anthony so there is sandy Smith and teams of course have rushed to over 100 door burn you missed an individual since 86 if you missed that they called back long touchdown scamper because of old what see them is able to get up and will come off with assistance you can see both his knee flex inward plus his ankle roll in as well who is trying to speculate which of the two is the more injured it's the other but we can only hope Carlo Cheatham is back before the nights over big year 40 to me all Southeast Conference would look at it once again again watch him jump to try to get out of the way and then we comes back down there boy the ankle really rolled in looks like his ankle more than anything Huntley takes his spot at second and three from the 19 yard line and up the middle goes Dean Williams close to a first down they have to get to just about the 16 yard line responded at the 17 it will be third and you notice the way the chip Ferguson has been carrying out his fakes rolling to the outside what that means is the coaches up in the press box are watching how the Auburn defense response today last time he rolled out no one from Auburn paid any attention to Tim Ferguson at all Brandon he didn't have the ball that time but he made coming up third and one and Dexter Carter fights his way for a first down and so this drive continues a timeconsuming Drive we have only a minute and 43 to play in the third quarter in Florida State on top five six boy what a big part of the Florida State Office Dexter Carter has been denied littlest man out there at five 974 pounds and he has played very tall tonight on the receiving end the rushing in that was just an extra effort by Dexter Carter to get a key first down inside fifteen he's a tough little on first down again the fake five surrogacy and throws it out of the end zone Reggie Johnson was the intended receiver but Ferguson has great instincts avoiding the rush his line has done a real good job tonight but when norborne has broken through Ferguson takes that one little step and he'll also stay in there and take a hit when he has to yeah Bobby Bobby bottom told us that chip Ferguson will wait to the last moment watch the rush from the backside by Brian Smith number 90 Ferguson sees him coming all the way and really made a conscious decision at the last minute to throw that ball out of the back of the end zone and a good one it was yes sure was I think Ferguson has played a whale of a ballgame tonight second and 10 this is the 13th play of the drive she's made by Gauci and he has wrestled down at the 11 yard line after a gain of four john wiley makes the tackle update from Miami Hurricanes out on top by 2023 two three over Nebraska and you really wonder if Nebraska's offense it's the type of offense that could play catch up football against really a superb defensive unit of mine third and seven Furguson fighting his way and he might have the first down depending on the spot inside the five they stopped by number 95 David rocker brother and Tracy man I started a moment ago and watch nobody stays with Ferguson the little bootleg he decides to run instead of put the ball in the air a good effort but you have got to contain a quarterback they'd shown this several times tonight you have to do it in their offensive game plan and he got totally outside three he's gonna be the drone the ball or run the ball he chose to run and he gets the first down Marcus on the way some football game if you said Dan his statistic may not be all they should be tonight because of all the drops he said well they've been setting this play up now for the last seven or eight times they ran the ball there's only three or four plays ago that I told you that Ferguson continues to roll out afterwards they're looking for a soft spot and they found it first and goal for the state at the floor Furguson will take a timeout Bobby bound and described him yesterday as a bluecollar quarterback he said he'd make a good linebacker releases the ball at the right time stands in the pocket Bobby not happy though about this particular timeout fall and this juncture because it comes as you can see with five seconds to go in the third period so Bobby you say hey wait a second you could have been here in five seconds and we wouldn't have had to use the timeout so a rare mental mistake tonight by Florida State there is with the senior quarterback that he knew he had a good one back win tip burger some of the freshmen in the Gator Bowl win over Oklahoma State that year his freshman year Jeff Ferguson was 20 at 43 over 330 yards a couple of touchdowns and Bobby Bowden knew he had a good one for a long time to come you know what happened there was it was kind of interesting they'd stopped the clock for the measurement and they restarted it Ferguson lost track of how much time remained as we say they they really wasted a timeout here because the quarter is over in five seconds anyway now when you get it down in this close we don't want to make any major mistake because whereas they were dominating offer turned into a real dogfight and we talked about Auburn battling back well I by Florida State they've come back also because they were being pushed around rather convincingly so first and goal with butts and Williams the running back in this site set Williams borrows his way to the oneyard line where it will be second and goal at the other end of the Superdome because the third quarter has come to an end at the end of three and the third quarter was a scoreless period 13 to 7 Florida State in New Orleans now Michaels Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf Flynn spawns patrolling the sidelines we start the fourth quarter 2nd and gold Florida State football game good long drive here for Florida save describe began at their own 14 yard line and this would be the 16th play they were struggling when they started this run Williams the fullback and he's their short yardage guy he scored their first touchdown and he short of the goal line here it's third down inside the one this is the kind of a drive that wins football games reestablishes confidence demoralizes the other team chews up a lot of time off the clock adds to a lead the kind of drive that when you look back both coaches have a tendency to view it as the drive that tipped the balance of a football game you know where Bobby Bowden likes to go when he runs takes it right over the big man hat tombola and his Oliver 300pounder over the right side third and goal off the fake they sling it out is that a lateral pass I believe it is I don't know depends if we're in Cleveland or not at the 19yard line they're gonna rule in a lateral and in Auburn recovery you have to play it if there's any doubt at all in your mind and Sammy's been gotta cover that no matter what it is watch where Ferguson's feet are right onto five oh that's a lateral by three and a half yards and Sammy's hit doesn't really get a chance to cover it the balls kicked by one of the Auburn players and underthrown Brian Smith I believe was the linebacker who got out there and kicked the ball why what a wasted ride by Florida State first and 10 Auburn at the 18 Dan Lee gain of 1 Felton Hayes and Odell Hagen's make the tackle there can be no doubt that this is a lateral buy a good couple of yards and Smith while it wasn't the greatest of efforts it might look like them covered up really had no chance at all as Brian Smith all over him and this guy knows it's a live ball he knows it's a lateral and he says that's the best thing that's happened to me all night that is a reprieve from the governor whoa second and 8 from the 20 reggie slacks all the time in the world and finally lawyer Tillman so where's a lawyer when you need him he finally shows up the big man again great protection for Reggie slacks all the time he won it uncovered area six for 220 pounds working against the zone he's chucked by the up man turns in behind the linebacker and wide open and Reggie's back was right there with it Theo Tillman caught that ball with his hands always a sign of a good receiver even ones coming right to your chest catch it with the hands from the 35yard line Reggie slack and open over the middle is Freddy way again so there 2t wide receivers have been pretty quiet tonight but all of a sudden they both got noisy bursts down over at midfield very simple pass route Freddy wagons went to the far side just runs a deep curl right into the zone and I'll tell you what this pattern needs watch wagon how deep he goes and then it's a soft curve into the middle you need great protection that's a pattern that takes a long time to develop and Reggie slack had nothing but time Auburn at the 48 a Florida State counter gas Stanley good hole and they ran it just like Washington did it the Super Bowl last year to the 41 yard line family playing the Timmy Smith roll for a gain of eight all the way that play for the play here it is watch the two off linemen the garden the tackle bull watch the counter step this direction then back into the hole everybody runs it there's the counter step the two off linemen in front of him Jim Thompson the tackle gets through makes the block you know it's a good play no matter where you run it all the way down to junior football second and two at the 41 sadly first down to the 33 Frank family doesn't exactly hug that ball to his torso doesn't looks like about 32 that we watches he carries it a little loosely they tried to convince him scrimmage for an hour early in the week and running manly on sleep they were very concerned about the way he carries of always cover this was last year when he was a freshman thirty and forty times in a row on a Monday they make him carry the ball to teach him how to protect you first and ten fake toss Dan Lee escaping the initial pressure running and gets to the 26 yard line and turns with would have been a sack into a 7 yard game Reggie slack made possible hardly by the athletic ability of reggie slacks but at the same time it's an absence of a florida state pass rush one guy comes through Odell Hagen's but you can see he was on his way down and then it's number 93 Shelton Thompson but he gets faked by slack and again a superior athletic play by Reggie slack good athlete is out of Milton Florida Milton High School where he was a defense she back a running back and a quarterback here in his his high school years and you saw that athletic ability a moment ago second and three from the 26 lawyer Tillman it's rule the cat and he first down at the 16 and Sanders interestingly enough watching he won't even hit lawyer tell me Deion Sanders is just going to make it assumption that this fall is going to be too low big buck you know if you're a defensive back you've got to come flying in there try to make something happen jarred loose whatever tough to be a spectator and make anything positive happen first down at the 16 yard line threading his way to the 13 for a gain of 3 945 to go in the game leading 13 to 7 this is a strange game this game of football couple of minutes ago Florida State is threatening to put this baby on ice and here we are now Auburn somehow continues to stay in this football game and again they're the ones threatening to take the lead to well coached football teams you can say that both teams have been on the ropes at one time or another this evening second and 7 from the 13 Dan Lee initially hit and then the second hit puts him down back at the 15 a loss of two staying Scheiber making the initial contact slowing him down it'll be third down leader back there they bring him on the safety list he's got three sacks this year this is the type of situation where the Seminoles like to bring flat cyber rather third and ten from the 16 black looks it out but no gain is the catch is made by Dane Lee actually he falls forward for a yard but they're at the 15 now fourth down Dalton Hayes comes up to make the tackle so fourth down and nine at the 15 yard line Florida State has the defense when they have to happen well it's fourth down and nine and we're not going to try to read pack ties mind that we all know about the tie controversy last year he's going to shoe the field goal attempt here and go for it on fourth and nine with a told floor to play in the game but now this isn't fourth and to report the one this is fourth the nine yards for first down fifteen slack under pressure and they throw a flag and they're going to rule in a sack as he throws it away Howard thinkin's teams team charging through intentional grounding will sedan a loss of down and a loss of the football that's a meaningless penalty anyway because they turned it over on downs even but then they would have turned it over at the 15yard line and given the defense if they have I think that's faction into his decision as to whether or not he would attempt to go for it but is acted this is really critical for them the penalty all the way back not over their own 37 yard line I I find that the choice to go on forth stranger calls I've seen in vodka funny thing about this game it wasn't the most glamorous of the bowl matchups but if 50 to be a pretty intriguing game and it has been hard hitting game the decision again Daniel you don't like it well no I I just don't see how when you've been trailing the entire ball game you can get at that position on the football field and run the risk of coming away with no points we're not dealing with 4th and 1 or 4th and 2 we're dealing with a fourth and 9 situation the odds are really against his flooring in that situation and it's compounded by the vacuum gets the throwing the ball away penalty and then instead of it getting turning the ball over down at the 15 yard line now you turn it up over at about the 37 yard line I'm convinced in my mind if last year hadn't have happened that I would have kicked the field goal right there I'm taking his chances but I you can't coach on what happened a year ago I agree 36 yard line Smith bust loose and fights his way to the 46 yard line he turns no gain into a possible first down close enough to measure it's a super football game and I really think what entered into Pat dies mine I've got the number one defense in college football if I leave it down there my guys are going to get it back they're gonna hold him at the 15 yard line I'm gonna force them to punt I'm gonna get the ball back at the midfield and what's happened now you get the penalty and all of a sudden you get an extra effort by Sammy Smith and all of a sudden Florida State is out near midfield second and inches from the 46 yard line and it's Williams three first half you know what I think guys I'm sure he's thinking in his mind he knows he needs a touchdown at some point because he knows he gonna be kicks a field goal there he's not gonna settle for a field goal he's gonna have to try to win the game so he figures well I might as well try it here but I agree with you fourth and nine at the very curious pool you take the field goal in my estimation and Pat dye certainly disagrees with my opinion I mean he expressed that by by what he called but you know you can come back and kick another field goal and make it 1313 but with eight minutes left in the ballgame at that time hey there's an opportunity you could kick two field goals you could have wanted 16 13 I mean I don't think you let a tie enter your mind with eight minutes left in a football girl it'll make a good sidebar tomorrow and Murchison catches his own tipped pass and then bats it forward Brian Smith was the man who blocked it and you will watch a lot of football until you see a smarter play than that because if Ferguson catches the ball the pass was tipped the quarterback knocked it to the ground this is simply an incomplete pass that's exactly what it is but it is also simply the saving of about 15 yards by Chip Ferguson if he catches the football he gets tackled and he loses 15 yards this is quick thinking on your feet and under a whole lot of pressure because you can see it Brian Smith right in his face bash the ball away and quickly Ferguson gets rid of it yeah that's that smart although a whale of the game I almost told on to it too long yeah patty held on to it too long and they would have been a fumble second and 10 snitch look at Smith Smith I think was something to prove tonight here's the guy they were touting for the Heisman early on and he didn't figure of course in the balloting at all and had a very disappointing season bothered with injuries etc and tonight putting on a pretty good show a real good show against the number one defense in college football in a lot must be going through Sammy Smith's mind we mentioned earlier a redshirt senior good go professional if he want to do we're going to have to make that decision he says he'll make it very shortly st. so to think about drafting him he said his two best games of the year in the stadium third and six from the 48 set up the screen to Dane William O and first at the 36 Jane Williams who already has a touchdown tonight on a short plunge into the end zone this time shows his receiving skills another good pass from Ferguson who I think is just playing an outstanding football game and air Williams I guess they're saying it he takes it upstairs not a whole lot of cutting back on the part of Dame Williams he just went for it and paid for it and that was Carlo Cheatham and we saw it sheet the last time we saw item number 35 he was being helped off the field who made that tackle that's right Carlos sedum remember he got cut down by Terry Anthony flexed his ankle back in there good news this wants to let the Seminoles so he's back him harder and Dexter Carter has done a very unsung job tonight as the backup to Stanley Smith I've been singing about him he is a tough guy five nine hundred seventy four pounds good receiver good running back okay we near that side you take it back across the middle against that defense breaking the grain getting the extra yardage you're showing me something he plays bigger than he is I mean some guys weigh 170 and play that way they're their scat backs they're the mosquito type of runner they're just kind of bounces around but not charter Carter's a guy that will take it between the tackles with regularity second and five for the 30 his partner again and he gets to the 28 yard line and a very key play coming up here not only as florida state tries to get the first down but if they are able to keep taking the time off that clock or under five minutes this may be the most actionpacked scoreless path I have ever seen not a point on the board but the team's marching up and down the field there it is nothing but goose eggs a good football game going by set course and we haven't had to talk about wild cards with homefield advantage third and one from the 28th or a nice play by stalwart Ron stalwart this is peace our two teams that are fundamentally sound the tip Ferguson wanted to get rid of that football he would have liked to have gotten rid of it he knew he should have gotten rid of it because of the field goal range possibility but great coverage on the part of John Wiley over on the wide side of the field there's no place to put this football here comes the Blitz but it's that same rollout that they tried and ran before Frank successfully and you just don't do that this many times Stallworth is sitting there waiting for it burn was this you know it's one thing to be burned twice his stupidity and there's nobody stupid on the Auburn defensive side of the ball good defensive team work and for that big play they're forced to kick and Florida State will be pinning Auburn very very deep at the floor SimCorp lose pick is down there and so the Sugar Bowl and it's been a good one comes down to a conclusion here the Orange Bowl is over so so this is it the seventh and final bowl game as the day wrapping up War Eagles and the Auburn Tigers begin from the four yard line as slack from his end zone throws complete after the 21 yard line the Walter Reeves the tight end who has scored the only Tiger touchdown tonight you take three minutes and 21 seconds like we have remaining now in college football where the clock stops whenever you get a first down while they move the chains three minutes and 21 seconds is an eternity and Reggie slack from his own end zone no stay picture perfect throw to Walter Reed if he somehow could have stayed on his feet really had a lot of real estate front first and ten from the 21 it's lawyer tilman at the 37 for a first down he team with two timeouts remaining and you have to have a protection to do that and Reggie slack twice now it had the protection Tilman bottom of the screen big number 85 we told you he's 64 220 big target slides in into the zone defense found the little opening and slack was right there his third catch of the night all in this half pushkin Penn pressured out of the pocket slack from the sideline throws it out of bounds the intended receiver was Vincent Harris but that's a situation where some quarterbacks and I'm going to say the majority of quarterbacks are forced into a sack because that was really defense pretty well by Florida State and it took Reggie slacks athletic ability to get to the outside and keep from getting sacked he stayed alive and as a result they'll have a second and 10 rather than a second and maybe 17 or 18 Barbour in 1984 al Del Greco kicked a field goal to beat Michigan 9 7 and then last year the 1616 tie win while one second left Stanly stopped at the 37 yard line minimal gain a negligible one at best screen abasa didn't happen the screen men never got out in front of it pickup of the yard third down and nine now counting left in the game third and nine well I know 38 you might say this is a big play yeah and slack flings it out of bounds intended for Greg Taylor and he was covered very well on the play it's fourth down so forth and nine from the 38 again each team with two timeouts and Pat Sullivan is now with the clock stopped you saw Sullivan signaling for the timeout so they're going to use one here and it simply means if they don't make it they can only stop at once for it's come down to this now fourth and nine Auburn at its own 38 yard line 152 to play got to pick one of the two guys when you say Dan that have been open for you all to Reeves the allconference tied in to Brady six or lawyer Tillman who all of a sudden has liven up this ballgame here in the second half during the course of the evening they got it's been there with the most regularities been Walter Reeves that'd be my choice tailor in motion on 49 and slack throws he is a man open first and Freddie way gay 45 yard line the best of all worlds horse and comic football I guess you stop the bus when you move the chains but good effort by a car the receiver offered the guy who's been there forever here forever Freddie wagon just running a sideline out pattern and given all sorts of room by neon Dion and the all world quarterback clearly asleep at the switch there why he gave way again all that room I'll never know they dumped it off the Dan Lee and he's actually get out of bounds to conserve some time and does but it's a loss on the play back to his own 48 yard line isn't it something how on a fourth and long play Auburn challenges the best quarterback in the country in Deion Sanders and Deion Sanders was asleep at the switch there's no other way to describe a guy with his abilities giving that much room on the corner that man you just saw told us he would do exactly that yesterday bat dye said well we have to go at him we think we're respecting as a defensive back but we are going to challenge him tomorrow they just have with a big one primetime was watching sermonette from the 50 under pressure and it's dropped at the 50 yard line by right really no damage there as it turns out heady quantity limit tackled right away and he was just at the line of scrimmage any way we would be able to lost three or four feet of water how about Reggie slack and his athletic ability to avoid the rush I saw no way that he wasn't going to go down under that pressure see Dinos Pat knows that they're better off dropping that ball that that play was going nowhere Bacon's and Hagen's made that happen all right the big rush how did slack stay alive this drive starting at the Auburn floor third and 15 and slack Bynes Taylor and he's out of bounds at the 40yard line he's four yards short of the first down so the ballgame again at hand here on fourth and floor coming up from the 40 but he did stop the clock 25 up and down with one timeout yeah they don't get a first down on the clock will stop again he could have tried to turn it up and get that first down but if he missed it then they would have been in a lot more trouble me all right now there we go fourth and four at the 40 again the pressure is on slack throws kicks Tillman and lawyer Tillman a first down at the 33 yard line Deion Sanders with a coverage but Steph by the big wide receiver tilman dion sanders in that zone defense at the time yeah that's the woman just passed off to it well you can't blame him totally for it shadow play uptight when they need four yards Sanders really has the coverage on the outside receiver Freddie wagon that was really quite an effort by standards coming up and closing in a hearth as it turns out to make the tackle first down jumped over the middle the catch is made by Dan Lee at the 29 yard line again Auburn has only one timeout Hayes and Smith converge on the tackle clock down to 55 they're going to go from the line of scrimmage second and five from the 29 yard line slack under duress incomplete while you're watching an athlete oh hey pressure I guess so cool com1 we're running back if he puts it back in high school and he's showing that athletic skill here tonight under a lot of pressure closing minutes of the big game of the year Robert the Sugar Bowl and he is up to it look at his face I mean look at that nonchalant expression I know I mentioned it early in the game I think back to what Pat dye told us yesterday nothing seems to phase this guy regardless of the situation he he has a presence she has his his wits about him nothing safe with kaya third and five at the 29 yard line slack over the middle to high intended for teen Wasden and so slack who has converted to 4th and plays on this drive 1/2 way game the other Tolman will have to do it again and only that kind of a hattrick would keep all burned alive in the prevent defenses the alumni hate most people hate that gives up a lot of yardage that they've got to get 6 good try good effort and again against that kind of defense you're always lucky you don't get it picked off when you don't hit your receiver so here we go as Auburn drives to keep it alive they've done it twice successfully on the 4th down it is fourth down at six now one thing that die is avoided last year's scenario if he kicks the field goal in the last time they're in a position when they're down here the possibility would be of a of a gametying field goal and you can say oh boy I know he doesn't want to be in that same situation as last year but I don't know if the alternative is losing sure I'll take the time I don't know whether it was calculated or not but it might have force Florida State to play a different kind of defense in their playing right now also fourth and six at the 29 and slack can he do it again the catch is made at the 23 yard line hailer first down the changes stop the clock I know one thing we've already had to vote for a vote my Most Valuable Player Award I want my ballot back if Auburn wins this football game I want it back whether they lose because what a drive by Reggie slack look at that neck Greg Taylor in the air holds on oh this is this is some Drive first and ten from the 22 this drive started at their own 40yard line flag its trot incomplete intended for Wasden and that's what five seconds did down to 19 and they do not according to the board they have one timeout but I thought that they had taken all three what a hit on Watson and we call that a knob or a knock ooh just take it right out of his hands by Leroy Butler really the pass was behind him very difficult cuts for Wasden to try to hold on to that ball being behind of it you're right a vicious blow second and 10 throwing down that looked like interference initially Oh way gain the intended receiver and dodge covering look like gods made contact before the ball got there I think we're gonna have to look at this dodge alternates with Butler who lit the pitch put the hit on Watson a moment ago and he puts the hip this time on you be the judge that's Derek dodge coming in from behind that's interfering you see that on the board right here Gary Todd gets away with manslaughter they'll be talking about this one in Alabama for a while third and tan from the 22 by crying time what timing Wow exciting it's not over when Deion Sanders walks all the way over the Auburn Mint can do a little joy Tilman just a little like the receiver that lawyer Tillman really a pretty good throw and Tillman doesn't come back to the football and it's 1055 Eastern some still 5 minutes left in prime time Sanders with the sixth interception of the air great athlete great sprinter we thought running back to the Florida State sandy Smith but everybody everybody in Auburn is going to say it should have been our ball at the oneyard line but that was interference on Dedrick dodge here it is again this is the play previous to the interception by Deion Sanders watch number 28 he is Derek dodge coming right over wagon Wow the back of the head the balls not that should have been called folks that should have been called and wasn't and so the game will end as Ferguson bumpers up and again he scoreless second half but more action than I think any of us have ever seen in a scoreless thirty minutes solid football team well coach each of them got in trouble each of them battled back having credit to be zip flurry played tonight by the two quarterbacks Reggie slack and my chip Ferguson these two played a bigtime game tonight all right let's get a word from Lynn Swann okay thank you very much Pat first of all when you have the chance to go for the field goal you're behind by six points you decided to go for the country are we really if we kick the field goal then we got to kick a field goal bluffs go touchdown the win if we score a touchdown we're gonna win anyway so what was last year's tie on your mind the six the past and the fair intro what was not called his passing the appearance Reagan's on the go long I mean you can't you can't go back to one play you know they've got a great football team I'm just proud to dock kids hung in and fought and it showed the kind of character that they've got because we certainly didn't play there's obviously a not a very wellplayed on our part particularly offensively defensively we played about his wing we move the football and has some success but we expected that government to end zone and you know I'm the way our offense put our defense in the hole tonight will mighty lucky to get out of here with 13 points coach thank you very much football game and coach Bowden and his staff and his team deserves all the credit in the world thank you very much coach wow that's a classy man right there yeah a good look there at not wanting to beef about a call or an on call that's why everybody in college football likes Pat died yep he's always been a standup guy we've done games in the past with him where he's he's been involved in controversial endings on the losing side but never ducks the issue 13 7 Florida State a Winston
