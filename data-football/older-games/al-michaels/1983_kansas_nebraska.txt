============================================================

mr. clays dish about a minute ago Mike Rozier make appearance and form at Memorial Stadium a tremendous ovation from another sellout crowd here in Waterford coke the introduction of another big star turned her Gil Gil they are home for years today as Nebraska seeks its 11th consecutive win the Jayhawks of Kansas against the number one rated Cornhuskers of Nebraska and very likely you will be watching the 1983 Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier favored by most to win the award he's averaging nearly eight yards per carry and he is on the verge of time for breaking five NCAA rushing and scoring record he'll be in action today and he won't be alone because they're an explosive team perhaps the most explosive in college football history featuring among others Turner's yell at quarterback and the biker wing back number 27 urban fryer Turner Gill can run the option but he can also throw deep as evidenced here and in fire he may have to preemie a receiver in the country Nebraska against Jesus coming up today day temperature high 30s but it's dry since no showers this morning capacity crowd 138 consecutive capacity crowd in the stadium as Kansas gets set to take on Nebraska and Nebraska rolling toward a certain Orange Bowl berth I'm Al Michaels along with league Rose cup the big question around here is not is Nebraska the best team in college football today I think that's pretty obvious but is Nebraska the best of all time and the people around here can make a pretty good case for that I think in terms of offensive explosion they are the greatest college football team I've ever seen a lot of superlative us started with their eye back Mike Rozier in a word I think he will win the Heisman Trophy this season as the greatest I back in the country and that's saying a lot because there's some good backs and good in Nebraska's history also their quarterback Turner guilt maybe the best and most talented they have ever had Irving fryer the wing back I think is the best wide receiver wing back in the country and ranks right up there with Johnny Rodgers as the greatest nebraska wing back of all time sort of lost in the shuffle because Nebraska's averaging 53 points a game is the fact that consistent score as well and it get a pretty good quarterback Franks Eyre has played under tremendous adversity this season because of the tragic shooting death of his father back in August but he's had a great season in AL I think he is probably the most underrated quarterback in the country this year might be the surprise of the program Nebraska an overwhelming favorite as we get set to kick it off in Lincoln the Jayhawks against the Huskers and Sita will receive the opening kickoff Jeff Smith is back deep to receive his return six this year averaging a little more than 17 per return and he's back with rookie Simmons and to kick off for Kansas is one of the best place Pickers in the country Bruce kuhlmeier soccerstyle kicker as we get set to get underway regular season anyway two weeks an Oklahoma good deep kick and it's fielded by Ricky Simmons a couple yarns it hit and Jeff's misses stay there you know what our offense can do we'll take it at the 20 yard line and the man who run this machine Turner Gill the quarterback at a Fort Worth then Mike Rozier the probable Heisman winner mark chalene is a fullback who doesn't get a lot of publicity because it was heralded teammates Irving fryer maybe the best of his position in the country and Ricky Simmons is the split end the Nebraska Cornhuskers averaging 52 point nine points per game start this Drive from the 20 on first and 10 out of the I formation slithering to the outside and slipping by on up to 23 snow showers this morning so the turf is a little slick up front now you've got Bening women jur is the left guard 260 pounder trainer which is the center he's been hobbled this week but he's in there stein cooler may win the Outland Trophy and Lombardi awards and Reardon is the tackle another very good one along with Inga rich in the tight end gain of three second down and seven from the 23 yard line it's the up back shame number 25 the game's one and it's third down and six defensively tans in with Vardy Cooper Avery Timmons Missoni eye and Gaines upfront Williams and plus for the linebackers plus is a pretty good one number sexy Amanda should be in on a lot of tackles that they falter Patterson and Ziegler are the three defensive backs third down and six with flyer in motion from the 24yard line and Turner Gill he's got a fine arm to put it up and complete for a first down but a fumble at the 37 yard line absolutely made the grab picked up the first down and fortuitously for the Branchville bumping the ball out of bounds Turner Gill with a single back offense now this pullback is the trailing back out here in the flat he catches the ball in the flat from Turner Gill marshalene covers the ball right there then loses it it is stripped by Wayne Ziegler number 18 by Kansas but fortunately it goes out of bounds the Huskers retain the football Willie Pless almost made the recovery number 60 but he didn't get there in time all on the ground touchdowns until tie the NCAA record for most touchdowns rushing into season that was set by Lydell Mitchell of Penn State back in 1971 and what's fascinating about that is that in that C backfield with Mitchell was Franco Harris I covered those two in a ball game against Iowa in 1971 and it was an incredible backfield but I think this backfield may be even more talented but what's interesting is the numbers that will pop up through the day and those of you in this area know all about Nebraska and what they've done those numbers would be even more impressive but you have to keep in mind the branch that keeps blowing people out Osborne is not the kind of coach who's going to pour or not and as a consequence if he wanted to he could have Rozier in there to the point where Mike might have had a twenty five hundred yards easy which would have been an alltime record as a result of that they have several other runners who are over the 300 yard mark so the numbers are even more impressive here on the screen second down and inches from the 47 yard line and an easy first out who carries the ball affront to the fifty and indicates his territory great offensive linemen today we'll be taking a look at Dean Stein foolish 71 he is 270 pounds and look at him he's one of the 12 finalists for the Lombardi Trophy Outland candidate and you know he was a high school fullback and you notice how he keeps those feet moving all the time Reina Terry alignment and open a certain firstround pick and the branch Quran it's very first Drive looks just like direction no problem one minute 55 seconds eighty yards six to nothing going on seven Scott Livingston to attempt the extra point out of the hold of Turner Gill Livingston has kicked xxx 31 this season Nebraska's drive consuming six plays still picking it up and now looking for two and Turner throwing out of the end zone intended for Tim Bergen of the 32 Mike Rozier told us yesterday this is his favorite play look at it as student body left now it's bending and Grima juror who make the fleet of he blocks that spring him along the left side then it's just a footrace to the end zone remember he has four or five speed in the 40yard dash the entire backfield runs for five or better so are underway in Nebraska leads by a score of six to nothing all right thank you Jim and as Tom Osborne charts of play for the Nebraska offense they lead six to nothing in Nebraska kicks off with mins him to kick at the 10 yard line and knocked down at the 25 first and 10 for Kansas and so they'll start their first drive from the 25 Frank's tire is a four mims was taken over as the Jay Jones is the fullback number 39 the white answer Darren green from Lawrence and Bob Johnson is a very good wide receivers caught 48 this season averaging 19.9 protects they spotted the 25yard line Braska top five scores nothing first down with four receivers now in this set two slots at two wideouts and they give it to the age back offensive line now for Kansas the men will have their hands full today Renwick Atkins from Chicago is 265 Paul Fairchild is listed at 257 semester is the way Benny pronounces it at 265 Casey brown the right guard 260 Reggie Smith from Chicago is 260 and Sylvester Byrd is the tight end second down seven for the Jayhawks from the 29 yard line before first attested by Cyrus incomplete intended for Darren Krein the Nebraska defense includes Weber urban tranfer Stuckey Strassburger prophet and NOx are the linebackers NOx is a very good one of a 44 Fisher Berg Clark and McCaslin are the defensive backs third down and six with the ball of the 29 yard line Nebraska leading early six to nothing sire before he can get the first down by Todd prophet number 34 is making the first start of his career al with that last run by Mike Rozier he has now eclipsed his own personal rushing record and 19 yards so you talked at the top of the show how he's on the verge of breaking several personal and national records he's already broken one on his first voluntary of the day he went in from 49 for the touchdown as Clint Colborne gets set to kick averaging a little better than 37 fryer and spit wolf go back deep for Nebraska the kick fielded by Irving Pryor at the 19yard line tries to get some blocking but it never develops and as a consequence they pin him back at the 17 so the Cornhuskers take over there 1122 remaining in the first quarter it's 6 to nothing Nebraska Al Michaels and lean gross combat before√∂ Stadium and Lincoln Nebraska old gray day but Nebraska on top by a score of 6 to nothing they have it at the 18 yard line Turner Gill the quarterback Rozier they stopped them at the 33yard line the Bob Devaney was the coach of the 71 team he's the ad here now and I had this chat with Bob yesterday Bob the question you've been asked a lot let me ask you to assess it at this point of the season now this team versus the team you had in 1971 which is better well it's very difficult to say at this point the season as knowledge as I seen his old rule I can answer that better I think offensive gave his team is definitely a better team we had 1971 this is the most explosive offensive team I've ever seen anyplace out and it's a it's a great football team all the way around but I think defensively perhaps that just they just I knew one team copy looked a little better Bob Devaney a man who should know and I mean that seems to be the big question around Lincoln in these parts what's the greatest team of all time it's really difficult of course because people these days are bigger and stronger and faster so it's difficult to compare a team from one ERA with a team from another but let's face it this is one of the best of all time there's little doubt about that at this point second down and seven from the 37 yard line breaks the tackle and works his way out to the 45 yard line on the first and he's tripped up by Wayne Ziegler you're looking at a man who may be the first pick in the NFL Draft and I think that he's clearly the Heisman Trophy favorite right now by a long ways getting back to Bob Devaney and Johnny Rodgers I think Johnny Rodgers is still the most exciting football player that Nebraska has ever had some of his numbers have been surpassed but in terms of just offensive excitement he was a threat every time he touched the football pleasing player Rozier taking the pitch and looks for little design there's a fumble and let's see who's got it at the 42 yard line with Nebraska on top six to nothing they maintain possession well the offensive lineman alertly was able to backtrack and get in there and as they untile it turns out to be the tight end monte interprets at number 83 makes the recovery getting back to that 1971 team now you know you got to remember just a quick look right here and the man who's going to be so important for Kansas today is Willie Pless number 60 he's the inside linebacker in the wild that white tackle six he gets the first hit their forces the fumble Nebraska recovers loss of three it's second down and 13 Oscars from the 42 yard line Turner Gill there's a flag thrown he hits the lien and Selene takes it off to the 47 yard line the Walker is down at the 37 yard line it may be holding on grim injure number 58 the offensive left guard so away for the call and the officials all out of the big 8 conference of course are headed today by the referee John McClintock folding is the call against Nebraska we believe it was Grimm injure interesting story I mean fable has it anyway that Grimm injure is a very ordinary type he is a junior from Grand Island Nebraska and a fella who at one point in his career did not take a shower for three weeks that wouldn't make you honoring it would it would blow a few defensive linemen right out of there without any contact in fact you know getting back to the 1971 team and to amplify on what Bob Devaney had to say al let's listen here for holding totally still second down to get back to the 1971 team and maybe I'll finish this story by the end of the second quarter it'd be they had to Outland players on that team in in Jacobson and Glover and they also had Willie Harper on that team that went on is still playing in the pros now so that's some indication of how powerful they were defensively on second down and 20 Gill is going green number 80 couldn't hold on to it it's interesting around the country for some folks who haven't seen Nebraska they think about Rozier and fryer they think of gilda's an option quarterback without much of an aura but that's a fallacy look at this as he throws his tight end Todd frame number 80 to the post and that was a very catchable fast you don't see Turner Gill throw that many bad passes in fact his passing efficiency is number one in the country 166 point five and that would put him ahead of Steve Young however he hasn't thrown enough time a lot of open space and Turner takes it out to pants the 40yard line but shy of a first down though spotted at the 41 Travis party made the stop so thanks and good measured to the penalty the holding for tattoos was able to hold the branch on this drive with 8 minutes and 37 seconds remaining in the first quarter the Cornhuskers will have to putt Scott Livingstone who is their placekicker as well as their funner averaging 41.6 this season Darren Green has dropped back as the single safety for teens is at the 20yard line snap is good and the kick is a high kick not a whole lot of distance and a fair catch is called for and made at the 15 yard line by Darren Green number 22 42 yard punt it's 6:15 Huskers series record is reflected there in the Braska with a big edge and Nebraska's 114 straight Jesus has not beaten the Huskers since 1968 first down for Kansas from the 16 yard line sire on a short roll complete out to the 30yard line number 88 Johnson making his 49th catch of the season and that ties the Kansas record held by Emmett Edwards to this point on the right Frank sire on the Left Bob Johnson number 88 who's playing with painted a shoulder separation he is showing you there that he has a lot of courage and the ability to catch that football in traffic johnson has also just said a big 8 singleseason record for yards 971 receiving yards this season for Johnson so at the 30yard line sire the the screen and after puffing tries to set it up and he was fortunate that the pass didn't get there because EJ Jones would have been buried right away second down and 10 Willie you touched on it on the open and we're not going to believe for the planting a lot of people obviously in this area know about sign know about the first in the tragedy with his father who had moved from California to Lawrence Kansas murdered in late August so it's been a very trying year for Frank the greatest moment of his career against Southern California to Los Angeles and upset the Trojans earlier this year walkway to the 40yard line he stopped there by Mike McCaslin number two so the Jayhawks trying to put together a drive that Texas was down 14 to 3 at one point they've come back it's 1412 so a major upset though in the making possibly there SMU ranked seventh leading Texas Tech six to nothing in the second quarter third down and short got a hold on a room through the middle sire carrying himself and we'll see where they spot it the yardstick is right on the 40yard line maybe just a tad past the port he will see in any event it appears to be close enough for a measurement Missouri at the half leading Oklahoma state Oklahoma at the half rebounding after last week's loss to Missouri Kansas State a half a higher state detect with seven minutes and three seconds remaining in the first quarter there is Irving fryer he's back to receive along with Jeff Smith but Cole born to do the punting Nebraska on top six to nothing by spiraling angling kick that's fielded by Smith and he's dick right away at the 24 yard line Jeff Coulter team down there to top them after a 37yard putt with the breeze at his back so 640 remaining in the quarter talked to Turner Gill yesterday about the fact he hasn't passed that much but still he's been effective here through his career where it doesn't really bother I guess in a way it doesn't way it doesn't you know I'm a team type four and no individual gold I just want them to come as they come you know I'm a team player and I want the pass in the column the rushing in you know I do both well and that's well fit real world is often called I can't do both and you know try to make a good longest returning Gil well put from a man who probably could have had a different sort of career had he gone to a fancy school his arm is good enough but all things considered I don't think he would trade his career for anybody else's at this point he's gonna probably play on a national championship team people have respect let me get a tremendous ovation today when he was announced prior to the game for his final appearance he has just given to Rozier houdin's eight at second down and two at the 32 yard line it's Rozier again moving through the middle and might have a first down as he nudges his way out to the 35 yard line and Rozier has already gained 93 yards today getting back to Turner Gill and what you were talking about they have had some outstanding quarterbacks here at Nebraska Kubek Vince Aragon David Jerry taggi but they think and I'm talking about most of the officials the coaches and what have you they feel that the Turner Gill in terms of allpurpose talent is the best that they have ever had pretty good record right there with him starting 27 and one first down for the 35 yard line characteristic took his eye off the ball drops it second down and 10 we have a moment to spend with Jim Lampley for this update from New York go ahead poun doors al Texas has broken the scoring drought 17 third quarter points they now leave 20 to 14 in the fourth Boston College's major bowl bubble was burst today Syracuse beat from 21 to 10 the big beneficiary in the East is Pitt back in the major bowl picture al Michael all right Jim second down and 10 for Nebraska from the 35 yard line a whole lot of room for Celine over the right side the Keynes's defense trying to get tough at least early on it looked like they were in for a pretty good shredding the way Nebraska moved on that first series but they were able to hold them on the second series and right now they've put the Brassica to position works third down and nine Kansas is one of the few teams in Division one football that still plays the old wide tackle six because of effective against the run brandman is the sole running back in this set with prior on a wing to the right on third down and nine Gil looking and throwing for the first down as it number seven kind of maneuvering right there by Simmons who know exactly how far he had to go to pick up the first down this is another thing that Turner Gill does exceptionally well is he throws on the move both left or right throwing to Ricky Simmons the split end here's a cute little move right here as he utilizes the sidelines Elvis Patterson on the coverage for Kansas and he'll is now 2 for 4 in the passing environment for 22 yards he gets to the 38 guideline the first down stop by Wien Ziegler number 18 the first half for the Husker is with 4 minutes and 51 seconds to play in the first quarter and Nebraska leading 6 to nothing that's what a Mike Rozier favorite plays it's a variation of the power Fitz it's the short fish that he takes off tackle instead of going wide and you see some of the acceleration on that last play first and on the branch good from the 38 yard line Rozier again to the short side of the field a lot of room but he's still able to pick up about 3 yards is he's bumped out at the 35 yard line by Patterson and Darnell Williams Mike Rozier has already carried and he could see 5 times 112 yards he has scored the only touchdown he and there's only one man in the history of NCAA major college football who has rushed for better than 2,000 yards in a season and that was Marcus Allen who didn't turn it as seen two years ago tony dorsett is the career leader tony never had a 2,000 yards season second now called incense from the 34 yard line Manas Rozier again who has stopped at the 30 T third down and four upcoming some of the records of the possible records most hundred yard games most points in a season rushing TDs we told you about that one with Lydell Mitchell and a couple of cool ear rushing average marks can be his by the time this season is done he has rewritten in Nebraska record book as we say the profitable iseman Trophy winner third for area spectacular except picking up the first down since you brought up Marcus Allen I think there's an interesting comparison here because two years ago there were a lot of people around the country are saying well Marcus Allen is a good college back but he has that great USC line that he's running behind and we don't know how great he's gonna be as a profession well the Oakland Raiders then Oakland Raiders now Los Angeles Raiders knew something and they felt that he was going to be a great one I think the same might be true for Rozier he is running behind a great line he's also a great first half from the 27 yard line Irving Cryer and motion Rose here's good to get to fire to the outside it's inside the 20 and Irving fryer one of the most exciting players of college football today and there too is another fella who's going to go in the first round he could be the first man picked in the draft the most talented wingback they have had since Johnny Rogers back in the early 70s here's a quick play that's been very effective Graham it's the reverse play gets a good block from Ricky Simmons number 7 Chuck steps inside outside lift leg along the sidelines the multifaceted Irving fryer from the 14 yard line it's Rozier and he gets to the 11 and you talk about the first guy to be picked in the NFL Draft but of course a lot depends on which team it is it's gonna get that big but you can make a case for Rozier you can certainly make a case for friar Steve Young is another fella they're talking about out of out of BYU it figures to be one of those so you can you think anybody else you might take another guy from Nebraska you might take Dean Stein cooler could be a bay if the team that has the number one pick is we're looking for an offensive lineman together second down and seven here's Rose here again the let's see for school season an estimated a full game plus three quarters of this one to go misdirection look in the backfield and look at the blocking here by number 58 Harry crimini leading the way Rozier you see some of the power that he has what he is so good at is that he is both effective as an inside and outside runner Mike Rozier this game is at 12 minutes and 12 seconds old in Nebraska Louisville T 2 Rozier has already rushed for a hundred 35 yards to the Gulf or to return to kill thus they had only six they decide to go for to make it 14 and that's what happens 48 to go on the corner fosters by two touchdowns there it is the lineup next Saturday on Wide World of Sports at five o'clock four o'clock Central Time weightlifting and figure skating 14 to nothing in favor of the Huskers as Scott Livingston kicks off floating kick into the breeze fielded and he comes to about the 25yard line where Mike McCaslin number two makes the tackle Mike Rozier what a start he has and he said a moment ago he now has 26 touchdowns in his career which ties Lydell Mitchell for an NCAA records amazing 64 seconds Iowa State last week and that turned out to be a rod so we spent a good deal to come and just picking up a hundred yards of corner these days nice pants by sire over the middle on a good game in the 48 by Darren Green just a little looking and after the 48 yard line first down Kansas and let's get another word from Jim Lampley all right I like it the wit with his poetry thank you Jim first absences from the 47 43 yard line by Robert nippers second down remember there was a sweep this morning so it's slick out there the snap from center never came up properly and as a result of that the quarterback didn't get it sire didn't get it Robert fins the tailback number 27 covers the loose football two minutes now to play in the first period Nebraska leading by a score of 14 to nothing it was second down 14:43 archive that sire throws the 50yard line Johnson the second catch of the day and he takes the ball into Nebraska territory they'll put it down at about the 49 yard line you've probably noticed now that the Jayhawks are very very multiple in their offense and there's a reason for that Mike Godfrey their coach has been very influenced by the Dallas Cowboys so you see them jumping around a lot a lot of different looks at from time to time maybe five to 10 times a game they'll line up in the shotgun Mike coming to Kansas from the University of Cincinnati before that Dorian State third and six in the 49yard line take over Green's made a couple of catches Johnson's made one and they're in business at the Nebraska 31 did you see that compact release right then and that bullet pass now Frank sire says that the man he admired was John Hayden another former Kansas quarterback who played for the San Diego Chargers and Hayden was instrumental in recruiting sire from Edison High School in Huntington Beach California essentially what your eyes the box the Jayhawks the 31yard line this is Kerwin Bell for the first time games a couple and a second down and eight Kerwin Bell is quite a story number four and you know he was a teammate of sires and at Huntington Beach Tennis and I and up in high school in Southern California what are we doing here we had some prints on the sidelines hoping he'd get cocky and Markie right there forty seven and thirty seven all right cocky and Markie Alexander out of Topeka Kansas second down and seven from the 28 yard line a sire goes back to pass that Strassburger intercepting at a man who turned down an academic scholarship put a guy into Dartmouth but he wanted to stay home illegal use of hands on the offense from the quarterbacks viewpoint the end zone right here you see that sire is setting up and trying to find Darren green number 22 the Scott Strassburger the stand up in is right in front there and he forced that ball into coverage that's one of the things he's going to have to learn if he wants to play professional football that's one of the dopes first down for Nebraska from the 17 yard line Jeff Smith is the eye back Irving fryer goes in motion and this is snitch taking it out to the 21 yard line Willie Pless and Travis party made the stop great thing about being a backup but tailback in Nebraska is that you see a lot of activity we've talked about this young man right here Willie Pless number 60 is the middle linebacker in the wide tackle six far and away the leading tackler on the team what he does very well is that he reads the offense so effectively so he instinctively is right in the right position at the right time second down and six marceline takes it on to the 23 yard line and that should be the final play of the first quarter as the clock ticks down right now it says five seconds to go so as the ad says as the commercial goes no surprises in the first quarter still Nebraska they're number one and they lead period to buy school Mike Gottfried is in his first season that Kansas took over for donphan brought his sixyear career record there includes his stints at the Murray State at Cincinnati and his record thus far this season which is three five and one we start the second through here this is al Michael Beasley gross Cup and Lincoln Nebraska on top five scorer 14 for nothing and on third down and two 25 Mike Rozier tries to pick up the first and he's close as Willie Pless makes the tackle this has been perhaps the most effective blocking tandem in Nebraska's history certainly the best in college football this year and you're talking about the right guard Dean Stein cooler number 71 and right tackle number 72 Scott Brereton 270 and 280 a couple of real hostas they got a lot of horses on this day Rozier did pick up the first down at the 28 yard line first and 10 for Nebraska Jeff Coulter made this job anytime he goes through the middle like that he's got a chance to go all the way he is really explosive however this is the key to any great running back is the hole opening up look at the size of that of course he breaks the tackle right there marshalene gets a block that helps springing but you see the acceleration I remember this man is 510 and 210 pounds but he runs the 40yard dash in 4.5 it's Breyer in motion first down from the 48 yard we've literally put there Gil has all kinds of time he's looking for Irving Jeff Coulter was right with her cherish that about a play that we saw in part of our opening front of our pregame show the fleaflicker now Tom Osborne is essentially a fundamentalist but he has always liked gadget plays now here's the the consummate flea flicker a pitch to the tailback a lateral back to the quarterback good blocking good protection Irving running a fly pattern but obviously he's out of bounds the good coverage there by Jeff Coulter number 33 for Kansas and you can see there's no absolutely no reason for that call to be booed on second down and 10 Turner Gill throwing and it's complete to the 43 of Kansas Machine Swanson makes the catch they can really move in this backfield at Nebraska there are the the speeds in which the fellows open kind probably what's most remarkable there is that chalene weighs 225 pounds and he's as fast as the rest of for serving is a step or two ahead of everybody yep third and inches Rosie checked up on a touchdown saving tackle by Elvis Patterson number 32 and the block of chalene was the one that struggled Mike Rozier so a first down at a 22 yard line Rozier is building up some unbelievable numbers 181 yards only a few minutes into the second quarter game isn't even 17 minutes old he's going to add a couple more yards here he gets inside the 20 to the 18 rot Timmons makes the stop Mike Rozier he's the seeking his third consecutive 200 yard game there it is on the day already it's in it's incredible 13 18 to play in the second Walker and you know if this one turns it to be turns out to be a route that has the makings of that right now he'll come out of the game relatively early second down and six at the 18yard line prior motion the whirlybird action by gil against and to the 11 yard line close to a first down we take a look at the first wooded numbers so typical of Nebraska football look at the dominance in total yardage but particularly the rushing yards 177 to 18 they were able to maintain the football for 10 minutes at once total dominance which bet has been indicative of their style of football all season long Mike Rozier has been the man first and just outside the 10yard line they give it to Mike Colter made the stop so add six more to the Rozier total notice how he uses his blocking he hesitated just a moment at left mark benek number 73 get out in front of it he's been called kind of a combination of Walter Payton and Billy Simmons I think that's pretty good second down they can pick up a person without getting to touch them for that here get some sandwiches both walks it was nothing progress and the whistle sounded ending the play so it's third down and about two and a half for the first down and three for the touchdown with 12 minutes and 10 seconds remaining in the first half and the Huskers on top by a score of 14 to nothing a lot of different ways they can go I got one on one coverage Jenna to the left Irving fryer in man coverage with they going to a keep it on you he had sideline Dale Mitchell what in the books lazier is on his way and the only question is when will Osborn take them out of the game just a couple yards shy of two with 1152 to go in the first fan unbelievable numbers for a game that is not even nineteen minutes old and the extra point attempt by Scott Livingston is no good brother not perfect did something now and again in 1152 remaining in the first half are they ready number one are they ever went into nothing Nebraska one of the reasons Nebraska is so effective and they're going in places they have three different ways they can score fullback tailback quarterback and UC Turner Gill doing something that he has done so exceptionally well and that is read a quick read on the option play pitching to the trailing back the eye back Mike Rozier was perfect timing and he just does a little tap dance into the end zone didn't even have to do a whirlybird that's out no didn't have to imitate Steve Davis or anybody like the brass gonna kick off Scott Livingston kicks it into the end zone and it's a fumble there and it will be a touchback for the ball coming onto the 20yard line 11:52 remaining in the first half huh screws on top by a score of 20 to nothing a reminder on Monday night there's the matchup the Los Angeles Rams under John Robinson head to Atlanta to meet the Falcons good matchup 9 o'clock Eastern Time on Monday Night Football Ferragamo Bartkowski interesting here a fish and the reason he left town was because of forecast first down Mike Cox the linebacker 44 was the Vanek Tipton there's the Interceptor Dave Burke is third of the season saiyr suffering his second interception looking downfield tipped by Knox now watch Dave Burke come into your picture number 33 and you see look at this look how Nebraska reacts defensively now once they see the interception you see some of the downfield blocking that has become a tradition of Nebraska football and once again they have ideal field position then receivers in there again at the 17 yard line they fake it to Mike he's looking for Simmons he is open and Gill bounces it to him Ricky Simmons had got completely open as you look at Dave Burke who made that interception amazing thing about Nebraska though is that here's a team that can afford to blow obvious touchdowns as was the case there Gill can make that mistake but you get the feeling picked about another minute and a half they're going to be in the end zone anyway if you feel if they can score anytime from any place on the field because of all of the talent they have totally it will second down a 10 with fryer in motion from the 17 yard line again we've got the whirlybird a new Big Eight rushing record with an touchdown or touchdown for last week he's over 200 for the third straight week dust off the mantle for highs McGovern Mike 211 yards today we're going to need a computer up here in the booth to keep track of all his personal records this is perfect timing on the pitch what a great effort by Turner Gill and Crozier bust three tackles as he goes in for a 17 yard touchdown run Gale Sayers my Crozier I'll tell you there are some similar tendencies the speed the the hesitations the dupes death the way they were pitched rehearse in the open field also both effective as receivers Mike Rozier is a complete football player he does it all 27 to nothing and the kick goes into the end zone now they're by bids we've got a route like this some of you are going to eventually if it stays like this we switched to the Georgia Auburn game and the those in the region around Lawrence and Lincoln will be staying with this one all away but contractually we can't make that switch until after the first half is over here so the way things are going some of you may be taking a look at that line but for the moment stay with us because Rozier is just going crazy 211 yards even a third over at this point it's out to the 26 yard line for a gain of six and Bill Weber number 87 makes the tackle what are the problems that teams have when they play the University of Nebraska is that they just very seldom get the football not only are they a great offensive team maybe the greatest in the history of college football but they have an active defensive unit not the greatest by any means but a good defensive unit and teams just don't seem to keep the football very long second and along for sire throws over the noise Bernier I probably would had a first down and he said he drops into its third down and a little bit more than four at one point I think that should be made about the Cornhusker defensive unit is that statistically they don't rank in the top 20 but I think those stats are a little misleading because many of the yards that have been rolled up against the Huskers have been rolled up against some exactly no way to tell I mean the numbers are an aberration in themselves because they've informed some of the opponents out you don't know what happens in the second half the 61's my cock's number 44 would ban event of that quick tip before also led to Burt's interception Mike Knox probably the best athlete on the defensive unit he's a he's a former wrestler good allaround athlete and he he will hit she becomes the play that's cliche number one alltime coach's joke APIs resurrected all of those cliches we've ever heard has me Clint coal boy and invented some of his oh boy go avoid the pun as he stands at the 12 yard line my floating dick fair catch ball or by fryer at the 43 yard line the man we were just talking about Knox the linebacker for the Huskers number 44 look at this look at that effort right there 10:29 to go and the first half mike max we went into that commercial looking at a replay of what he did on that last play good linebacker and his offensive unit goes to work again from the 43 yard line it's first and ten and it's Rozier who's having an all time day out of bounds at the 47 yard line and let's go to New York and check in with Jim Lampley again you Nebraska fans your pursuer remains unbeaten second ranked Texas survived against TCU 22:14 they held the Horned Frogs to only 133 yards with that great defense Texas now has Baylor at Austin and am at College Station back to Al Michaels all right Jim Mike Rozier is just picked up five more a ball at the 48 yard line second down and five to turn to Gill is rolling there's Irving fly on the face a little bit behind him so it's third down you know it's interesting nearly is that the day began with Rozier and 14th place in career rushing and right now he has already moved past Omar's past and miss Lawrence pastoral Campbell past Eric Dickerson and right now he has passed Terry Miller or his just about ready to pass during Miller and moving in ninth place in career rushing he's going to move up five spots in a day at least five spots he already has 216 yards in 23 carries this fryer in motion a third down and five they fake it to Rozier that's a break for Kansas right there and then guilt picks up the first down let's keep forgetting the basket kill can also run very well Ricky Simmons made a nice block on Kevin harder Ricky Simmons the wide receiver downfield blocking and that's one of the traditions as I mentioned at Nebraska is the fact that the wide receivers get downfield and make their blocks gene Huey the receiver coach for Nebraska former Wyoming player was with us yesterday he said that's one of the things he stresses over and over again first down Huskers from the 35 yard line and it's Gil of a nice place very very close to being in a Scot Kimball 88 intended to receive her good ball handling by Gil here it's one of the best fakes to an IPAC I've seen in a long time now watch right there it's the old open hand put the ball on the hip trick very casual very nonchalant as he slips back here and he's throwing to wide receiver Scot Kimball number 88 on a deep post pattern who is well covered by Elvis Patterson number 232 but that ball was possibly catchable very possibly catching 2nd down and 10 Rozier and they limited to a gain of three rod Timmons makes the tackle it's about as much as you can hope for when Mike has the book golden to three yards but what he did there is that he turned a threeyard loss into a threeyard gain because of his his strength and his agility final right there Penn State knocking off Notre Dame want to come back this season for Joe Paterno after that miserable start can't hit many go to the Fiesta Bowl that's possible 38 7 Syracuse 21 to 10 what happened to Doug Flutie's if he can't I don't know fix the Jeff Smith he stopped by Kevin partner after he gets the first down moving the ball down to the 21 yard line there's Rozier who was shaken up on his last carry so Mike getting some attention on the far side Jeff Smith the backup tailback had 367 yards coming into today's game he's not your just average backup by back rows here by the way and had a bruised guy so he did not go through the full complement in terms of practice time this week from day 21 yardline look at saline five or six Florida beads Kentucky by a score of 24 to second Virginia Tech wins by 11 East Carolina 42 6 leading South Carolina over Navy Alabama having their hands full today Kent State had broken that streak last week but they're losing again Bowling Green letting Ohio you by 10 second down at 4 with Smith in motion it's Gill rolling he's got some space inside the 10 Turner gets it down to the 6 yard line Turner Gill is a great athlete he was offered a contract by the Chicago White Sox but he came out of high school grew up in the Fort Worth Texas played shortstop for Nebraska's baseball team and no Larry Shepard the former Pirates manager at Red's the pitching coach and Giants pitching coach that lives in Lincoln follows this team he knows all about Turner Gill and the fact this fella could have played professional baseball about a 300 hitter right absolutely first down goal to go from the six yard line Selina's he goes here 30:3 nothing Nebraska if you talk about horses you're going to talk about Marceline 225pound but you know at one time he had built himself up to 250 pounds as a power lifter when he was at the University of Nebraska Omaha transferred back here slimmed down and I think he's amazing al because of 225 pounds he's able to run the 40yard that in 4.5 he too could be a firstround pick for the pros they're going to go to their backup kicker mark a German to attempt the extra point and the kick is good you know five remaining in the first half for nebraska leading by a score of 34 to nothing by the way they'll probably make it official after the game in Nebraska we'll be going to the Orange Bowl wind and blows the ball off the tee as Livingston gets set to take off Mike Rozier is that sang on the sidelines before we understand that he's fine he's okay but he still needs a some extra time here to regroup and Mike of course has had a day and a half in a quarter and a half a day and a half day and a half from the hospital dick is feel it at the goal line he steps back into the end zone touchback so Kansas will take over at the 20 yard line with 8 minutes and 5 seconds remaining in the first half and again the good many of you in this region when this first half is history will probably be taking in the Georgia Auburn game the remainder of that one but contractually we can't make the switch until that work down for Kansas from the 20yard line past the 30 in the first down as Darren Green makes the catch takes it out to the 35 picked up a 15 Hodge leave 9 to 3 in the third quarter Sooey Pig three big bears leaning rice 521 and Arizona making it tough on UCLA to get to Pasadena Utah over Utah State League gross Cubs alma mater doing all right cow leading Washington State six nothing 7 foot first and 10 the 35yard line full Shire is able to pick it up and take it out to the 37 yard line starting to sprinkle again here woke up this morning and the cars outside were lazy some snow showers in the Lincoln area this morning what's the windchill factor right now I'm not that bad Oregon leading Stanford Paul Wigan of course has resigned under pressure and they'll be gone at the end of the season temperature I guess is about 38 degrees as you look at the Stein cooler team's 10 cooler the offensive guard second down and eight got flags thrown contact was made in a line and Men States the bass gets it out to the 43 yard line it looked like Mike Tran burn number 64 in the middle was little anxious so it's offside against the Cornhuskers a cold wet day like this and sometimes be the case six minutes and 57 seconds remaining in the first half but true corn Husker fans will tell us that this isn't really even cold yet I don't think they consider it do they well one thing about it it's a lot warmer when your team is number one got that right and you're blowing people away like Nebraska is they are off next week are the Huskers and then they'll go to a Norman Thanksgiving weekend to close out the regular season jaejoon it's wrapped up behind the line of scrimmage by Mike Tran Verne number 64 we've got Mike Knox 44 isolated Mike Knox number 44 the weak linebacker in the 50 defense does a good job of warding off the blocker come right up and really puts his helmet right in the ball carriers numbers he has been far and away tenacious linebacker for them backup quarterback Matt nate nation is throwing on the side we will see him if not before the end of the half certainly a good deal I would suppose markets inside the Brett Clarke 6200 pounds Junior makes his fifth interception of the season that's the third time that sire has been kicked off today Brett Clarke is probably the best athlete in the secondary for the Huskers 37 tackles coming in today's game as you mentioned his fifth intersection good pressure applied by the inside linebacker Mike Knox once again forcing the interception so a first down and Mason is in there as the quarterback pitching it back and Mike Rozier takes it to the 30yard line there is that man that we just talked about safety man Brett Clark number 10 200 pounder here's another guy that could become an NFL player excellent speed good range good hitting ability he's a player on the Sydney are wondering what do you think would happen if Nebraska played the Oilers for the Buccaneers a lot of people have speculated that half court or some teams in the United States before even some piece of NFL teams of wonder second down and seven row zero is in motion and the went back around it is Irving fryer who takes it inside the 25 20 23 yard line Irving fryer is a man who has carried the ball 20 times this season coming into this game he is averaging 14 point 1 yards per rush and receiving he's averaging 21 point four yards per catch so when we talk about a big play man there is he and Johnny Rogers have to be the definitive link backs in the history of Nebraska football different styles except the fryer really is bigger and faster than right Rogers they still like in terms of his excited put a factory third down and one the whole second unit offensive line isn't there right now for Nebraska and it is goes here getting inside the 20 and Mike gets bumped out of the 14 wide line Elvis Patterson making the tackle Rozier has already broken the big 8 singleseason rushing record among others today he has now the started a 200 Bernie yard as he scored four touchdowns the bag drops the ball and a big sprint to the planet white shirt Jesus thinks they have it see they do what our nation might get their money cancer number 51 realism with a recovery with 434 to go in the first half and Nebraska Lyndon button score of 34 to nothing problems with a snap on both sides today invasive never had the ball complaining I watch number 51 Lynne Gantt coming from his right defensive in position he is the man who covers the ball for the Jayhawks first out of a 17 yard line or the Jayhawks turning in and gives the ball to Jay John thanks al linebacker here say he'll be back next week he had arthroscopic knee surgery and next week well here's not to worry about next week of course because they're off next week but what he's talking about is the Oklahoma game he'll be back for two it good luck to you mark second and five at the 22yard line roughly Robert bins and first down to the 31 yard line with 3 minutes and 52 seconds remaining in the first half once again for a good many of you who are watching this game now the way to stains at the vulva 34 nothing you'll be watching exactly half of the Georgia Auburn game after the intermission here others including the folks around the Lincoln and Lawrence change city areas will be a stay for this one all the way first a from the 32 yard line about the 42 yard line might have the first sound good stiff arm by sire that tag looked like he was going for the Heisman Trophy interesting to say yeah we're sorry they're dead strap it I think as I said this at the top though he might be the surprise next year in the program because he wasn't really rated that highway coming into the season but he's had a great year rolled up some impressive number was if any of the pro scouts now have him among the top five or 10 quarterbacks in the country first half changes from the 42 yard line no gain or a minimal one at best with 3 minutes and 18 seconds remaining the very sad under ABC's Wide World of Sports Saturday lady Robin cousins toddler Krantz Internet and the world weightlifting championships which are good buddy Bobby aunty covered in Moscow recently will be on next week second down recovered by Richard Estelle was the man who made the catch would be able to recover it but they can boil things to happen to chance it Richard a still beats the safety ban on a post pattern there's the hint right there by Burke number 33 it appears momentarily that bins number 27 has it but it's Mike McClintock the cast with the monster back number two ultimately recovers for Nebraska so it's a touchback ball comes up the quanti yard line no touchdown no tax down no nothing except if you're a quarterback you still get the yardage on the completion and sire has rolled up some impressive numbers through the year so a first half for Nebraska now from the 20yard line and turned her guilders back in there and he turns and he gives the ball to sophomore from Grand Island Nebraska as a however from that expression it doesn't look like he's into tremendous amount of pain oh that's McCaslin there are he's not in any pain at all second down and three first down as he gets onto the 31 with a minute 58 to go in the half Jeff Smith is an interesting story the backup tailback to Rozier as I mentioned he had 367 yards coming into the base gave him a 5.1 yard average he is scored five touchdowns which do you think it's pretty good let's say half a season but on any other team in the country a starting tailback and rolling up a lot of yards but you played young Mike Rozier maybe a lot immediately thinks of God this easy first half of the 32 Turner Gill and abrasca please by a score of 40 minutes the 8 yard touchdown pass they wanted to they could score 120 points today is that about it you wonder why Turner Gill is regarded as the first round draft choice by some of the pro scouts you see it right there that ball was thrown about 50 yards in the air to Jeff Smith the I back who beat Elvis Patterson along the right sideline it was thrown with a nice soft looping trajectory and it was perfect it was a perfect palm Hagerman extra point is good and with a minute 34 seconds remaining in the half it is 41 to nothing in favor of the Cornhuskers they scored 41 points in one quarter against Colorado earlier this year I say I'd like to find out who it is what does it beat people were a couple of guys they're still voting Texas is number one I'm not going to diminish what the Longhorns have done that's a fine football team but I don't know how anybody in their right mind cannot have this team on top you know they because of that controversial play against Penn State you remember that sure prank the outofbounds play with what they thought that when the Braska thought was an out of bounds cash yep so they they have a score to settle they want they want the national championship turn a gill good quarterback good shortstop Tom Osborne the lowkey coach at Nebraska intense dedicated that's a yeah best way to describe em I guess he's not flat he's the antithesis of flashy but he's dedicated he's he's got himself a tremendous powerhouses he's 41 to nothing in favor of the Huskers Robert not very far however and he's decked at the 18yard line oh we were talking about Mike Rozier penalty flag is down see about the call and we'll get a word in a moment there's a clipping call against Kansas well Mike Rozier closing out his home career today there are his numbers in less than a half an incredible day four touchdowns and I spoke with Mike yesterday during practice mike most people feel that you have a lock on the Heisman Trophy how significant will it be for you to win it well I'll be pretty happy you got winning highs but on my dogs telling other other reporters you know I think we had to win the Heisman my main goal is no finish up school and play ball here universe the grass we won a national championship but all those we don't come around I won't be upset no I just talking about his Heisman prospects you're a betting man go out and put down five bucks on it he's gonna lock up carbs karahi's for no gain five said are you gonna put down that see no we're we're talking about a nominal sum here right in my heart apart something tells me cancers will not be using its timeout you're exactly right you know Hoss before we go away and we may lose our regional audience here in the section in the second half I just want to wish you happy bah it was happy birthday well third thirtynine is Ania free well it's not saying that's a documental I appreciate that happy birthday same birthday next third down and 11 from the eight yard line it's men's who takes it out to the ten and then we'll end the first half to the big the big question is will the Jayhawks reappear for the fact can hardly blame them if they don't well they'll be back so Lee it's halftime 41 nothing Nebraska back after this message about an upcoming showing ABC in a word for your local stations GPS second half of the Georgia Auburn game and the rest of you will be here meanwhile at halftime but let's send Eve in New York from Jack Whittaker 41 nothing to Braska Lydia real stadium in Lincoln Nebraska no surprises this afternoon so far for the capacity crowd the halftime score as you can see is Nebraska 41 Kansas nothing and a cold chilly day and a crowd has been entertained by the University of Nebraska marching band the directory Stoppard pastor Robert spoke I'm gonna take a look at a couple of highlights from the first half and of course this can be labeled the Mike Rozier show this guy started this 49 yard touchdown run on their first drive Mike told me today this was his favorite play it's sometimes known as student body left and look at that blocking out you said earlier the Red Sea parted for this man and along the left sideline he goes by this time it's just a foot race and remember he has four or five speed in the 40yard dash and he goes for his first touchdown of the day we're going to show you his third touchdown this broke line del Michels record the 27th rushing touchdown this season for Rosia right here and that goes back to 1971 when Lydell was it from the same back bill with Franco Harris at Penn State all he does after the pitches coasts into the end zone Rozier scoring four touchdowns in the first half Shalini also scored from six yards on and Jeff Smith on a long bond here from Turner Gill this was impressive look at this ball thrown with a soft blue pigment Gill the backup I back Jeff Smith and that was not as perfect of passes you're gonna see a land you know we've talked about the fact that Nebraska has possibly four or five firstround draft picks and that Turner Gill is one of the guys who's considered that and normally you wouldn't think of a guy say 511 sixfoot who is as versatile as he is as a typical pro back but I think the NFL scouts are rating him a lot higher than he was rated at the top of the season you know it's really impressive to Lee as you look at this team they are the top priority on every other team schedule they point for Nebraska and yet there is absolutely nothing that any of their opponents have really been able to do the season outside of that one game Oklahoma State somehow lost only fourteen to ten Missouri thought they were in the game and they were for a while and a couple of breaks may have changed it around but when it was said and done Missouri lost by two to three touchdowns anyway they have just been destroying people this is a great team obviously well they were a 41 point favorite in this game and if you look at the scoreboard now it's 41 zip I think Mike Gottfried had a terrific line he said this is David versus Goliath only this time there's no sling shot the question also comes to mind I was just listening to our producer Curt Goudy he was always filling me in on something I assume you had a decent line right there I said it was David versus Goliath with no sling shot thank you thank you for the replay is this the best team you've ever seen I would say it certainly is the best offensive team I have ever seen in all the years that I've been covering college football 41 nothing at the half second half kickoff coming right up thing at the half second half kickoff coming right up teams are coming back out onto the field for the start of the second half and they are the halftime statistics and very little of course in the way of a parity you might say 346 yards on the ground from Nebraska in one half it may be the quintessential non parity first half indeed now look teams historically who run the best and defend against the run are the teams who win most consistently and if you looked at the numbers that are reflected there you see exactly that is the case of the first half for the Huskers Valery's Mike Gottfried now what in the world does a coach who's a team frailes 41 to nothing at the hand well he told me yesterday that they would have to play Nebraska the entire length of the field which euphemistically is a way of saying that they have to stop the big play now obviously they haven't been able to do that at all in the first half now what he's going to have to do in the second half is that he's going to have to come out and play catchup football the whole time look at the numbers here on Mike Rozier in the first half that's what he's done so far and as you can see with 1888 yards now he figures to go over the 2000 mark he would need 112 and let's assume he won't play in the second half here that he's done for the day 41 nothing there's distort 112 should be a routine afternoon even against a team like Oklahoma and that's the game remaining on Nebraska's regular season schedule also keep in mind abrasca playing one extra game this year they were given the exemption to play in that kickoff classic that opened up the season at East Rutherford New Jersey when they bond to Penn State so here we go we start the second half to kick things off for Nebraska Scott Livingston number 48 booting with the wind at his back in the dusk in Lincoln and it's filled at the to the 40 we'll get strapped at that spot now the Nebraska defensive line features bill Weber who is 6 1 to 10 Doug Herman is a good one they picked him up on a South Dakota Mike Cranmer there's the nose guard Rob Stuckey 63 250pound er Scott Strassburger we talked about him earlier he had a chance to go to Dartmouth on profit making his first ever start and Mike Knox had a fine 1st half 1st of 10 for the Kansas Jayhawks from the 14 yard line as we started the third quarter sire to throw bounces one incomplete intended for a green the defensive backfield Todd Fisher from Omaha the Berk and an interception in the first half so did Brett Clarke the strong safety and the free safety is Mike McCaslin also known as the monster back in the 50 defense and it's a defense that's pitching the shutout at this point with Nebraska on top 41 to nothing second down 10 sire the quarterback double slot formation four receivers passes batted down by the Kerner so third down looked like one of the wide outs for Kansas was unsure the play was perhaps a illegal procedure that is the call flanker to the right signaling to the man to the left to move out even further as you look at the Kansas offensive backfield the sire that Jones and runs of the running backs and green and Bobby Johnson caught two passes in the first half and now has 50 on the season and the fellows up front provide their hands full today third down and ten at the 14 yard line Nebraska on top 41 to nothing in the opening moments of the third quarter gets around okay but defense that as I said before has been underrated all year long their statistics are not impressive but remember that because of the great offensive effort of Nebraska so many yards have been rolled up against substitutes so the defensive stats are extremely misleading this is a good sound defensive unit not a great defensive unit but a good defensive unit when Colburn to kick I long kick in degrees fielded by Smith at the 38 yard line the corner for so we won't even see the offensive unit after a 63yard run back for a touchdown by the reserve I back Smith one of the best reserve I banks you're going to see this year Jeff Smith number 28 finds the wall along the right sideline the last man who has a shot at him number 31 the putter Clint Colburn is jukes right there and into the end zone goes Smith extra point attempt is blocked Hagerman kick was low and was blocked and we played 36 seconds in the third quarter it is 27 to nothing Cornhuskers so the Kansas Jayhawks will receive with 1424 remaining in the third quarter Nebraska's on top by a score of 47 to nothing Scott Livingston gets set to kickoff for the Cornhuskers Kansa will take over the Tony we talked about the tragedy the death of Frank sires father he was murdered in his restaurant in log it's been a very difficult year for the young man and he reflected upon it yesterday at practice well when it first happened you know footballs too fast for my mom and I didn't it really was amazing how something like that conflicted in perspective but I you know I started settle down and just think about what my dad really wanted and I you know I made good sense of me to keep working that much harder because I know he wanted this more than anything for anybody and you know it's just a chance for me to go out and do the things that he want me to do tremendous performance turned in by that fellow under very difficult circumstances he of course was very close to his dad and his father had moved from Southern California we talked about Frank growing up in Huntington Beach and what a great thrill that was for him this year to go back and not only to have Kansas to feed USC but to do it in the LA Coliseum his father a onetime professional football player himself for the Denver Broncos second down and six at the 24 yard line sigh rolling and looking for the first down and takes a pretty good shot but he gets it as he gets to the 31 yard line and he's tackled there by Mike Knox number 44 sire who had an amazing high school career at Edison high in Huntington Beach in Southern California played with the Bell brothers Kerwin Bell Dino Bell between between sire and Bell in their senior years the two of them had well over 3,000 yards and it was very well balanced offense because Furman was doing the running and then sire was doing the passing and it was a very explosive office they won the CIF championship and the state championship and there is Kerwin Bell in the backfield and that is he with the ball who takes it out to the 40yard line a pickup of about nine early in the third quarter at Lincoln by the way those of you obviously a Nazarian no there are no permanent lights here but our good friends from the Musco lighting company have come up from or over from Iowa with their portable lamps and that's that's why it looks like we're in a middle of daytime sort of yeah they're really do a great job lighting up stadiums without the lights and we were able to present the late afternoon games play that otherwise two years ago would have been impossible Kerwin Bell takes it out to the 43 yard line he just saw the numbers on him during his freshman season and it looked like he was going to be another Tony Dorsett now his sophomore year knee injury surgery injured again in his junior season he's shown flashes of the old brilliance at times this year but he never really lived up to those early expectations and of course they say that in life your demands and your expectations are sometimes the source of all of your misery who said that I forget first down from the 42 yard line maybe too much time you've got three flex it's like the memory book that I forgot to read got offside they√µre encroachment against Nebraska I think a good example of that would be the Dan Marino story remember the expectations that were pinned on him last season to his senior year at Pittsburgh and he comes into the NFL this year after a bad senior year with very low expectations and look what's happened to that's right it's been a great story talk of the town in Miami yeah that's that's true because last year of people expected Marino to contend for the Heisman and then probably win it and he didn't I said it was a bad year but it's all in a relative sense Miami was able to pick them fortunately for them but he didn't have a type of year which would he'd begun by the time I got to that graphic ass is a little high and we've got triple the penalty markers done ference call coming up Richard Estelle the intended receiver and Dave Burke game a pop and they'll call interference on FERC at the five to forty five yard line pastor first on the defense first out oh look here interference call on number 33 Dave Burke actually no it's on Mike McCaslin the monster back right there you see the premature contact Nana means a first down for the Jayhawks at the 45 yard line Sayaka fake protections good has got a man wide open and it seemed complete intended for Sylvester Byrd the Tynan had let up he was so wide open he started to let up a little bit and that cost him he was signaling back to sire that he was open and but that time Frank had already found him and he couldn't get there in time that's exactly what happened he slows up right here if and he kept going full speed I think this would have been a catchable ball also I think Frank sire in looking at that when he sees it on film will say hey I should have taken a little something off that pass sire is a six out of 17 for 133 yards at second and at 10 at the Nebraska 45 yard line Protection is good with a screen first down inside the 30 tight ropes a sideline but he's out of bounds at the 23 yard line he set down at the 23 great tightrope action along the sideline but his foot head stepped out back here aways that last 10 yards was amazing hi this is a slow developing stream flight of the eye back Robert Ben's number 27 it's well set up now watch what he does right here along the sideline I think this is a good example of the type of balance you saw his right foot hit the chunk mark back there but look at the last 10 yards before he ultimately goes out of the house he was first Africans is at the husker 24 yard line and Achaia draw play with 222 the 18 yard line bail injured in 8182 he also had problems academically and he was out for a few games last year because of a suspension tina's has been under a lot of pressure they've been the subject of a I guess we thought basically ongoing investigation by the NCAA very upset it can be it's not an easy task for oh my god for you to come in and try get things turned around kokes second down and five get set threeways sack at the 25yard line Kame sheet among others number 99 who is the third team nose guard right there they are that deep nebraska suits up close to a hundred players and almost everybody gets in auburn continues to lead georgia 13 to nothing that game in the third quarter SMU is rolling along as is BYU third and 11 and they'll operate this time from the shotgun at the 24yard line sire throwing and nearly intercepted pass was hi Costel was the intended receiver and it will be fourth down so we've got ten minutes and 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter Nebraska on top by a score of 47 to nothing for late tuners in this one has gone very much as expected a route for Nebraska a tremendous day for Mike Rozier who in the first half alone carry the ball 26 times but 230 yards and scored four touchdowns meanwhile here is Bruce Paul Meyer to attempt a 42yard field goal he's one of the best in the country but this one is real good why did so the Nebraska defense is still fixing a shut up ten minutes seven seconds remaining third quarter Nebraska 47 teams is nothing John haina let's the main reason Frank sire came to Kansas I played against John Hagel in the old American Football League back in 1962 talking about the the lighting before covering the Sun in the wide shot as we move around the temporary lights that came in as Nebraska takes over they've got Gill and Rozier in company back in as well as fryer Durling makes the catching gets dropped at the 28 yard line but you know it was interesting on that little bumper we had coming out of the commercial was that Havel and everybody knows about John as a quarterback was also pretty good defensive back in back holes the interception returned wreck not only a defensive back but he played halfback one year and quarterback the next and he made allamerican at two different positions which i think is one of the most amazing things that I have ever heard I've never heard of another player make allamerican in successive years and different well Mike Rozier is going to add to it struggle against the first time he gets out to the 36 yard line you know it's it's a situation where a coach like Cavazos board has to feel well you know here's a Rozier he's on his way to a Heisman you're not gonna run it up some people might say well why is he in there now then again I mean he he's only played a third of the game he missed most of the second quarter at least got to put him in for a couple of series and then it was this absolutely but some people interpret in his running up the score it's really not in a way though or just going for his personal staff which is wrong first down from the 37 yard line and his rosy right now as he was when the score was nothing nothing Willie Pless the inside linebacker number 60 and the wide tackle six overruns the play what's the little Juke step by Rozier right there that fakes him out you see the quickness and the acceleration and you see why they compare him to both Billy Sims and Walter Payton particularly Billy Sims I see a lot of second down and one it's Turner Gill keeping nice action move and he picks up the first down slither on this killer you see why he is considered the best allpurpose quarterback in the big 8 and why he's going to make all big 8 possibly an allamerican and you know we talked about this earlier if he threw the ball more he would now lead the nation in passing efficiency he actually does lead the nation in passing efficiency with 160 6.5 as opposed to one sixty six point two for Steve Young of Brigham Young however he has not thrown enough time do you have to throw at least 15 times per game to qualify for the passing efficiency leadership now he would need to throw 39 times totally in the last two games to qualify I don't think he'll do it it's highly doubtful it's also in of the I'm curious to see where he's going to go in the draft we've been talking about you saw the graphic illustrate in the 11th firstround picks in in 10 years time out here is the injured Kansas player number 55 Darnell Williams comes back but they're going to have they're gonna have Rozier obviously go in the first round prior Stein cooler figures to they are even talking about rare did maybe but it'll be interesting to see where Gill goes in the ground and where he'll play with a one of the play first two 10 from the 43 yard line Gill back to pass throwing i intercepted and that comes Lane Ziegler to the 37 yard line so the pass was too high intended for Irving fryer and Wayne Ziegler a freshman from Nickerson Kansas makes the first interception of his career for the Jayhawks 47 closely gruska we're in Lincoln score is 47 to nothing guess who multiple choice yep nebraska first down for Kansas from the 38 yard line Frank's iron has gone all the way he's protected well again he's going for the bomb he's looking for mends and it's nearly intercepted Robert man who's the intended receiver he was doubleteamed by Brett Clarke and Dave Berg each of whom has an interception already today excellent coverage this time by the Huskers Dave Burke number 33 and Brett Clark the safety man coming over there covering mims number 27 who was trying to run them fly or streak route along the right sideline the ball was well thrown but the coverage was perfect second and 10 819 to play third quarter higher Dick's a football I believe it's a fumble there was no indication that his arm was coming forward in Kansas still has the football at the 33 yard line crusher was put on that time by Doug urban number 63 sire straight drop back he's moving forward in the pocket he pulls the ball back down there comes number 63 Doug Herman and it looks momentarily is if Kansas is going to lose the football but then it had already been whistled bit third and 15 with a ball at the 33 yard line sire he's got a green light open over the middle hits him and he takes it all the way to the Nebraska 40 yard line where Brett Clarke made the stop Darren green that's on had lined up well wide to the right one in motion toward the middle and it gets it wide open Brett Clarke who we've talked about as the best athlete in the Nebraska secondary shows you what he does as a safety fan he reads the coverage now he sees that he's got to come over and make an open field tackle and that's really like giving a clinic in the open field they put went right through the numbers meanwhile we have an injured Jayhawk here think that looks like Renwick Atkins if I'm not mistaken tackle we've shaken up Monday night the Rams take on the Falcons the Rams on top along with San Francisco and New Orleans in a tight battle in the NFC West in Atlanta at four and six two games back and what's interesting we said this earlier L is how it relates to this game today is that Vince Ferragamo is the quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams Steve Bartowski in the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons now Bartkowski is the reason that Ferragamo left the University of California to come to the University of Nebraska then irony is a Gottfried comes off and we talked about Mike and Murray State and Cincinnati and his record collectively ride their Reggie Smith not Atkins was the the injured man who has come off but with some assistance is Tom Osborne looks on that the career record will be 107 24 and 2 very shortly as his team leads by a score of 47 to nothing first and 10 at the 41 yard line inside the 40 Robert bins we've lined up in a slot to the left gets a couple leather look at Knox here Mike Knox is probably the best athlete in the Nebraska defensive unit it's an unheralded defensive unit but he's a guy who sees a former wrestler good allaround athlete very physical player a lot of intensity and just what you want at an inside linebacker in the 50 monster defense second down and eight at the 39yard line sire setting up the screen bins massive blocking and gets to the 32 yard line at Vicki's just shy of a first down as Mike Knox gets credit for the tackle and do we have some drizzle I think we also have some snow flurries as I look go up to it to the left here terrible storm here earlier in the week first big storm of the year on the plains then it cleared out at midweek and we mentioned earlier yesterday clear and some snow showers this morning of course where we live in Northern California we had the first big Pacific storm of the year more to come there is Bobby Johnson number eightyeight who is the leading receiver far and away on the team has been playing her playing with a very painful shoulder separation they had him strapped up in the first half and he made some catches but obviously he will not return for today he caught two passes in the first as 50 on the season twentynine Deena do I have to comment oh you don't Azura is leading oklahoma state by six and the fourth per head Iowa State rebounding after the crashing last week at the hands of Nebraska Wichita State shocking southern Illinois Louisiana Tech oppa texasarlington you're in here in rare form today know something second and eight at the 29yard line and silent Rose over the hands of sandy McGee and it'll be third down sandy McGee coming trying to find the open area right here the Falls thrown a little behind him but he took a look over and he saw a fellow named Mike Knox number 44 and I guess the the term for that is hearing footsteps footsteps in the ball I understand third down and eight sigh rifles 1 inside the 15yard line Richard Estelle number 82 so the Kansas Jayhawks are driving trying to get on the board with five minutes and 34 seconds remaining to be played in the third quarter and the Huskers leading 47 to nothing Estill number 82 is running a curl in route Todd Fisher number 6 on the coverage for Nebraska that's the type of pass by Frank sigh right there that makes him a pro prospect nice and release and able to drill the ball about 30 yards and throw the frozen rope first down at the 14 yard line sire on a quick slant Rick incomplete pass intended for a stealth and the greeting party was provided by Dave Burke as you look at Oklahoma defeating Colorado 41 to 28 next opponent of course for Nebraska whoa how about this am jackie sherrill and a 13point win over the Hogs go cats team is ready 13:06 second down at ten from the 14 sire lofting one toward the corner an incomplete intended for sandy McGee memory and the coverage provided by Neil Harris arrogant leading by six UIC in Washington Washington leading in to nothing and all of a sudden now Washington because of Arizona's victory over UCLA good point good chance for them to wind up in the Rose Bowl against Illinois in Illinois of course quenched it's Rose Bowl berth today congratulations to Mike White well what a job he did great story he's a nice man he's a great coach and we're really and a real innovate we're down 14 yard line sire throwing into the endzone for a touchdown sativas gets on the board at pictured Estelle who's played a prominent receiving royal here in the second man makes the grab for the score and it's 47 to 6 still running the route that he ran moments ago now look at this he goes down he comes in he turns out and the girls back in again and that ball talk about throwing a bullet pass on the numbers that ball could not have been drilled more appropriately than what cranks iron just did just then that's why he's a prospect Estelle has fought for today for 101 yards and that's his first touchdown of the season and Cole Meyers extra point attempt is good five minutes in two seconds remaining to be placed third period it is 4077 in favor of Nebraska first attempt the 19 yard line he's after the 27 that's the ultimate game tackle right there about seven guys in there Dean Stein cooler one of 12 finalists for the Lombardi Trophy out Lantana date number 71 watch how he keeps that extra remember he was a high school fullback and there's never been a big man run quite this fast what's amazing about him is in 270 pounds he has been time before point six in the 40yard dash second down in the yard a half it's Big Mike again why why minutes and 13 seconds three is a new Nebraska single game record as you can see that's the response to the fraud afforded mr. Rozier numerous Danny ho Mike Rozier who spent most of the second that quarter on the bench first down from the 38 yard line using the keys is territory from breaking it all the way as he gets to the 44 yard line very shortly we're going to have to be thinking in terms of an NCAA record right off the top of my head I think the number is 350 yards now take a look at Rozier all the way you see the quick start watch the cutting ability the streak the agility we've talked about the fact that he is such a complete football player not only the inside running in the outside running but a good blocker a good receiver he can also throw the ball out nice move by Gill here was Smith in the game a time back but the Turner is going to go down back at his own 46 yard line turned her Gill dropped by Charles Cooper Cooper getting the hand on him that was enough for Christmas one high spin trophy yeah they're going to make the announcement with well before Christmas normally in early December is when it's announced and if he didn't have a lock on it when people see today's probably could give it to it for Thanksgiving yeah absolutely second down and 19 from the 47 yard line Magill deep and incomplete Swanson was the intended receiver well the second leading candidate of course is Steve Young of BYU has been rolling up some phenomenal numbers this season but Steve young doesn't play for Nebraska he doesn't play in the big 8 he's not going to have the national attention and the last time I Nam running back won the Heisman Trophy is what Pat Sullivan of Auburn got it back in 1972 later than say Tiffany 171 I think that's right Rodgers wanted 72 third down and lon and van gogh's Hill that could be a 40yard line as Charles Cooper again a backup at tackle who comes in to make the sack closer look at Turner Gill and you can have a look here at some of his athletic ability he's dropping straight back and he's looking to throw a pocket pass but right there that's kind of a quarterbacks nightmare it's the old sandwich play he being the bellowing you're but fielded at the 50 he flooded the fair cats made their the 2 minutes and 6 seconds remaining in the third period 4077 Huskers on top well a reminder of course and you'll be reminded of this quite often I'm sure over the next couple of months but the Winter Olympics are a minute you're off to Sarajevo I'm going over to scout it out to see if they have room service this week and then we'll be there in February of course for the Winter Games and ABC with exclusive coverage of the Summer Games next July from LA and I know you believe in murder absolutely see if we can do it again from the 16 yard line SIA throws a bounce pass that's incomplete second down and 10 sigh air has gone oh it's been a frustrating day and your game plan goes out the window very early when it's 20 to nothing and you've hardly had the football that was the case today you go right to the back pages of your playbook and you forget about establishing a running game and you play catchup football I got a great trivia question for you what former Kansas player scored a hundred points in a single game but I think it's a I think it's great alright well we'll chew on this one for a second second down in town we'll get a draw play here takes a notch in the 22yard line look former Kansas players scored a hundred points in a single game it was a great player in the former the Junior yeah here comes the answer folks the answer is well chamber absolutely against what team against the Knicks in Hershey Pennsylvania was it and George Hill is telling me he was 28 and a 32 from the freethrow line that move was against the University of California no no no he was when he was a pro but when he was a pro okay third down and five from the 21 yard line and it's complete out here to the 30 for a first round and a nice little move made by green turned it into a substantial gain out to the 39 yard line where Fred park rides him out of bounds first now here's a great split screen a screen look at the timing that is required by the quarterback and the wide receiver on a sideline cut now you see that Darren green and the is running the cut and the ball is actually in the air before he comes out of his ground that's probably the definitive third and long route first and ten Jayhawks at the 39yard line a thrilling 4077 and their sire and incomplete intended for a sliding Richard Estill second down a minute seven seconds remaining to be played in the third quarter sire and he'll probably do it next week when Kansas plays Missouri closing in on Lynn Dickies big eight record he was so your hundred yards away and he's already thrown for 234 yards a day 12 of 30 career yardage so 292 more yards and we're talking about singleseason big eight right and also a career record for Frank as you look at his numbers it's pretty good number in terms of the arts percolation he's averaging close to 20 yards or reception and is passing a completion rate is 40 percent which is not particularly impressive we have a congratulatory message if you'd like to deliver this thing this is important volleyball championship we saw the volleyball is a very big sport in these parts yep just had the tournament the high school tournament coach Julia Hills children women's volleyball team on Friday night when the state Class D two championship my store girl rowdy whereas here in Lincoln they take a look at a graphic that illustrates the family affair guys on the Kansas team chuckles pretty good football player to pass and throws it out of bounds that is even more eddie Simmons and an uncle John Locke are over the Steelers Dino bell bottom line there is interesting my car ba√±os yeah of course the father there is Fred our baddest the armor allpro tight in for the Kansas City Chiefs oneeyed tight in every he lost it the sight in one eye and then when Todd made a great comeback he became an allpro after them he's to catch those passes for money Dawson viene a terrific career hurry down at 10 sire for a salad bounces incomplete incomplete and so it will be fourth down with 55 seconds remaining to be played in the third period speaking of volleyball speaking of volleyball watch this here we go curl route now here's the pass here's the set and there's the kill right there and now the spike is coming right yeah thus the last spike was kind of ineffective I don't know we're gonna have to get a new striker I think of a pass in the set we're pretty good well here's colporteur to do the punting last time he punted they ran it back for a touchdown did Smith and this time it Smith again there but nothing doing this time it's decked at the 16 yard line and thus it will be Nebraska's football with 45 seconds to play in the third period 47 to 7 and again the chant goes out we're number one and there was little doubt about that Eddie Lee ivory out of Georgia Tech 1973 56 against Air Force Munir is the figure for rosier that's Jeff Smith County and a penalty marker goes down for a possible Lee hood there's a well there's no question about it at this point if Tom Osborne wanted to keep Rozier in the game that could probably get that record we've got a face mask all against Kansas with Craig Sundberg now running the team the third a string quarterback for Nebraska deserving fryer Irving's got his a uniform top off so curving could be wrapping it up for the day it was that a flagrant facemask call so that's that's why you only have a fiveyard penalty instead of would you normally see a 15yard call first down from the 24 yard line 35 that means the reserved he do get the feeling that Jeff Smith could be first he would like a lot of schools and he probably will be here next year as well because Mizzou will graduate Crick son Berg's mother Linda visited with us in the booth and his father David is a former a Cornhusker himself he is the third team quarterback and a good one sunberg leading him up to the 45 yard line on first down and 10 little role to his left and he throws and it is picked off at the 44 yard line intercepted at the 44 the wrestling match went on as the third quarter expires and did they rule it a reception it's possible there was a wrestling match going on and a little conference amongst the officials as to whether or not he caught it or not and apparently they are going to award the ball to Brian hybrid tie goes to the offense I goes to the offense in this case Brian I made the catch so the look is see if we can tell Greg Sundberg on a roll to his left and you see the wrestling match the aforementioned wrestling match with Al Michaels talked about huh between himer and Ziegler fight tie goes to her Ziggler's already picked one off today into 347 seven hostages Al Michaels and Lea gross cup with you at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln Nebraska Mike Gottfried old old Moorhead quarterback right Moorhead by the Licking River in Kentucky that's right a long day for Mike but not unexpected as we start the fourth period Smith takes it to the 15yard line where Wayne Ziegler makes the stop Jeff Smith who has explosive speed Mike Rozier appears to be finished for the day and what a day for Mike wrapping up his career at Memorial Stadium again they look right there in rosier Keene within 71 yards assuming he's done for the day even in 71 yards of breaking the mark set by Eddie Lee ivory again a look at some of the records that belong under his name right now yes far as career rushing today he eclipsed the mark that was set by Rick burns against Missouri in 1978 single game record Burns had rushed for 255 yards from the 16 yard line sunberg takes it down of the egg this is if we were talking about it before Li the fact that the numbers are so impressive and yet then again they are not nearly as impressive as they would be had all these guys been in there all the time I've said before that the teams who rushed best and defend against the rust historically are the best team now look at the dominance they're in rushing yards for 23 to 79 amazing to Mike Rozier of course out brush the entire team again twice defending our second down and short Tim Burgin for las Heras irving fryer I'd say he is really an exciting player mr. big play right there he mentioned earlier that depending on a professional teams needs he could be the first player taken at the professional trap learning didn't do that much today but through his career just his presence alone gives the defense nightmares woman announcer third down and two Sundberg improvises and picks up the first down as he takes it to the 4 yard line 130 consecutive sellouts here at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln Nebraska that's an NCAA record and today 76530 looking on Sundberg has decides you like in a quarterback he's 6 1 1 by T he's from here in Lincoln he's happy to be getting the chance to play today we talked to him yesterday he had a chance to visit with him he said he hoped he would get to play penalty markers down preparatory to a first and goal and illegal procedures the call against the Cornhuskers Nebraska was a 41 point favorite in today's game I don't think in all the years I've been covering football on television I've never come in and where a team was favored by so many points right now they're exactly 40 points but a shooter well in fact in most of the lines in the papers this week that was a listing that went in hell which means no line you couldn't even get to a wager down on it if you wanted to and it was simply and believed in USA Today weird Andy Sheridan posed his odds every week that he gave us some indication of the disparity between the the two teams 47 to 7 is a score team victories in the last 20 years of course Bear Bryant was there for most of those Nebraska Devaney and Osborne SC John McKay there for a long time break Sundberg scoring Tom Osborne looking to the future with his junior quarterback break Sun bergna that's about as the most emotion you will never see out of town on I watch what he does here is he executes the counter as we like to call it the whirlybird up Jim fakes to the fullback comes here now watch what he does it's a quick read and he sees daylight ahead and he goes right for the endzone good North and South running by number 15 breaks up Burch so it's 53 to 7 we've got Dean Snider who's the 3rd different man to attempt an extra point today kicking this one through it could be an NCAA record for all we know three different men of kick thanks to points 12 54 to go 1547 Huskers as to what's happening there two minutes left in that game here 12 minutes and 54 seconds remaining in the game 54 to 7 in favor of Nebraska it spins back teeth for Kansas Schneider will kickoff for Nebraska he is a sophomore who just booted that last extra point at the tail they get down into the second third and fourth units as far as the eye backs and the wing backs and the quarterbacks and even the police cookers three different men where the placements today this one will be fielded by men's of the three so first down at that spot the jury makes it to two wins in a row over the Oklahoma schools they beat the Sooners last week and the Cowboys today Washington state maintains a sevenpoint advantage in the Palouse country against California Oregon beat Stanford for 16 to 7 Washington 17 and USC nothing in the fourth period the peril of the Palouse never know what's going to happen need a piece in Washington bill buckles 24 yard line fiftyfour seven if you tuned in late this one went very much as you might have a misfit Nebraska scoring early and often and it has been no contest turning point with the National probably sung by a former Husker Anthony Cena that he steals now with the Boston Breakers in the United States football not fast the 25yard line goes Bell and he rings up a first down that's too Bellus carry eight times for 38 yards first down at the 25yard line you should have a birthday every weekend you know you've been in rare form I think it's that they gave you a corncob pipe tonight you've been in a real damping foster Creek so exactly right there's a certain agent that'll lay back and assess things clarified back and sire throwing deep and incomplete incomplete intended for Richard a spell Frank's played the entire game there is numbers reflected there he has a chance in this game if he can reach the 292 mark to break the single season big a record passing urine into the season let's double check that are those the exact numbers that he needs for a big a trend Lila the point to which he had to get second down and ten sire back to pass and he sets up the screen Kerwin Bell how fast the 30 and Belle takes it to the 36 yard line that appears to be a first down now he needed 402 yards total so if he doesn't do it this week we he will probably do it next week it could be for the career though let's check it out he eats we're double J we're triple checking career passing coming into today he would have needed for old one to tie just as I was saying good eats 402 total horse as I told you last week you didn't major it man then you gotta lay off these numbers is really important first and ten from the 36 yard line sweep to the left Berlin Bell and he gets out to the 40 yard line where Ricky green makes attack give me those exact numbers again I want to just clarify this one more time if he gets to the 296 yards mark he will establish a single season passing record which is held by Lynne Vicki in 1969 okay and 402 gives in the career then you get the idea second down and six sire faking right going complete and tended for Kerwin Bell Mike Rozier 85 years there's Mike Mike listed his favorite announcers yesterday and the story here he like he like John for sendin number one you know Jonah does the NFL huh or used to do that the narration on the V with the dramatic voice that's exactly right Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers game twotime final score Auburn wins it by a score of 13 to 7 over Georgia third down and six from the 40yard line sire throwing the bell and he takes it out to the 44 yard line so he is shy of the first down it will be fourth down at about to win 10 minutes 22 seconds remaining in the game so there is an old highschool battery they both played together in Edison High School Huntington Beach California and rolled up about 10 zillion yards together as they want both the CIF and state championships came here at one time they had a total of five players from Edison High School all looking for the beach they were misinformed Clint Colburn to punt for Kansas they'll take the snap from the 30yard line time fissure back the improvisational tickets one dead then sister line takes it in for a touchdown and I believe it was dying Rozier the brother of fight areas number four he's the man of watch the king what a day for the family little guy goes back and they likeness you to see what I did not work for it great story there he is and there's his brother isn't that great look at that there's Mike who's after the game because the steam has turned into a rock appearances will be made by Michaels here the guy was here has made his presence felt next to the point Mike Snyder is good and the Huskers lead at 61 the seven you see the fumble right here improvised by what's number four guy Rozier coming in he blocks it and Dan Kastner line number 24 a sophomore picks up the loose ball and look what's a hand nothing but daylight great day for this young sophomore 9:35 to go in this carnation 61 to 7 Nebraska hey let the Fighting Illini through the Rose Bowl Nebraska leading at 61 to 70 strip check curl and Bell falls on it at the 21 yard line and it will be first and 10 for Kansas at that spot with nine minutes and 31 seconds remaining in the game Ferragamo of course has been controversial right long changed colleges then changed professional team went from the Rams to Canada and back to the RAM having a great season this year Aidid of course by super rookie Eric Dickerson first up and they go to the backup quarterback Mike or the freshman from liberal Kansas who hands off and it's taken out to the 24 yard line for a pickup of five liberal Kansas I know where matter of fact liberal is tucked into the southwest corner of the state in a breakfast 64 daily and coffee shop and liberal is there a conservative cancer specific in bed huh second in five of the 24 yard line hand off in a first down and as Mark Henderson who's a freshman from the Lawrence Kansas now all of them say you chase it out to the 35 yard line a first down for the Jayhawks slashing running style kind of makes you think of John Riggins who of course was here in the late 60s before he was drafted by the New York Jets ultimately wound up as the Super Bowl hero last year running behind the Hogs of Washington Rosie Rozier well after the 39 yard line for a gain of three and it'll be second down at seven o'clock running with 8 minutes and 20 seconds remaining in the game Turner Gill ending his whole career these fellows will go to Norman to play Oklahoma in two weeks and then it'll be on to the Orange Bowl in all likelihood or a matchup we would suppose against Miami at Miami defeats Florida State tonight second down at 7 and Kerwin Bell moves the ball out to the 43 yard line and there's a this one winds down again we'll roll these scores for you Texas had comefrombehind Walburn held on to win that one Illinois goes to the Rose Bowl that's official SMU the team that gets less respect and then me in the top ten just keeps on rolling plants McElhaney continuing to be a great wedding quarterback has this Steve Young at BYU Ohio State gives it to Northwestern and Penn State and a seesaw game beats Notre Dame third down and three and a half boy by Estelle the man who scored Kansas his only touchdown its forth that Pittsburgh routes are me sir accuse over Boston College and a big upset there jigna rolls over rutgers that's surprising in light of the fact clemson beats maryland by so wide a margin 25 points I didn't think they'd beat him at all I did again after what we saw two weeks ago where Clemson upset North Carolina Maryland upset him call Meyer who normally punt or he's the place kicker Clint Colburn is the punter he stands back at the 30yard line to accept the snap it's time to snap is good but his kick is a line drive one hopper that is fielded at the 14 yard line my time fisher needs to drop back at the 12 Cornhuskers have the ball 706 to go in the game 61 to 7 braska Nebraska has this one well in hand first unit guys have had the the day off for about a half an hour right now saw Mike Rozier men to stay for him right now Nebraska has it they go back to Nate nation at quarterback on first half of the 14 yard line and he gets written down by number 95 Joe Hassan di he's from Hawaii and I mean I should know these things cover but it's been a while where you told me you used to do five Samoans on a fast break it but you know you when you get out of out of practice I mean we had some early training with bottom Aliona frank mono male unit the former san jose state so that to us is so PO right come on let's go let's go oh second second and 13 from the 11 yard line nation got some room takes it out to the 22 yard line and it will be third down and around to Mason is 205 pounds bumper eight who you see there the backup quarterback one of two backup quarterbacks that we have seen today Sundberg being the other and in talking to some of the Cornhusker officials yesterday they told him that Mason was indeed a good athlete he said particularly he has been effective in practice sessions and in some of the scrimmages and running the option play not the passer obviously of a third down at two thirdstraight tailback I think it's all machine guy they just keep changing uniforms I can't believe in that scene 78 yards with a 13 back full miles all miles on the same play that Rozier used so effectively earlier in the game it's a variation of the powerbitch except that he cuts it up quickly a big hole there and all it is is the footrace to the end zone after about the first 12 yards and he ends up going 78 yards for a touchdown talk about dip at that I back position they have had of course a tradition of great I backs through the year and can't hit the goal post so the conversion is no good 534 remaining it is 67 to 7 favor of the Cornhuskers 67 to 7 in favor of the Cornhuskers the Chevrolet MVPs are selected by a league Rose cup in food Frank Shire of Kansas with group of 245 yards and Mike Rozier of course wins the award for Nebraska and as the kickoff goes into the end zone for a touchback so in each man's name a $1000 scholarship or from Chevrolet and the general scholarship fund in the name of the player Mike Rozier tremendous day for him today Virginia over North Carolina boy did Carolina fall apart how how they faded remember when they were 7 and oh a couple of weeks back sure Florida wins gamecocks went 31 7 fourth is the quarterback draw play Carlinville alabama winning Iowa beats Michigan State I would should wind up in a bowl game the way things look right now Wisconsin in a high scoring affair takes care of Purdue 42 to 38 again the Tigers beat Oklahoma State by a score of 16 to 10 how in the world that oklahoma state ever hold these guys to a fourpoint bankers a mystery after seeing nebraska today second down and six mark Henderson a freshman out to the 20 we talked about it at halftime the fact that Nebraska has rarely been even tested this season tussle against Oklahoma State 14 to 7 it was the game against Missouri which was one of those games where as the saying goes it was closer than the score would indicate but nevertheless the final score was 34 to 13 so they won that won by three touchdowns on third and short they're not going to pick up the first down and needed to get to the 30yard line and Henderson never gets there so the Cornhuskers are going to get the ball back again and if they can move it down score they're going to go over 70 and that's something that has happened twice already this evening against Minnesota on the 17th of September and then 72 points last week against Iowa State they came into the game averaging fifty two point nine four game so let's say it again this is the most explosive offensive unit perhaps in the history of college football call Meyer who is also the place kicker does the pumping here and it's juggle but recovered by Nebraska by shane swanson at the 31 yard line look there just look at the the offensive numbers in the one thing of course that sticks out as you look at it in a complete floor there is that 14 to 10 win against Oklahoma State the only time they have been truly tested this season every other game has been a rout major blow a major blow the UCLA game was interesting 42 to 10 as I recall was very close at that halftime UCLA let at the hands that's right and then they went crazy there it is quarter by quarter this season coming into the game today and you can add 67 more points to that total of 529 so they are just shy in fact a touchdown away from 600 points for the season shaken up with Swanson and among other things today Nebraska has broken the NCAA es scoring record as a team collectively major college scoring record first out of the 33 yard line and of a couple right here most points scored in a season 1980 Brigham Young scored 560 points they play 12 games a unit abrasca has already scored 596 points in this their 11th game of the season these what's ironic about all of this is that nebraska may end up competing with itself for the greatest team of all time because in an earlier survey the 1971 nebraska team was chosen as the team of the century but a fetch on the option play that abounds on the far side as Tim Burgin number 32 it's interesting the Sports Illustrated did a piece on Nebraska earlier this year talking about as I recall Doug Looney was the writer about some of the great teams in history talked about the 71 team and the strength coach here at Nebraska said that the fellas on this team are far stronger far faster bigger than they weren't 71 so that's an interesting point but then again saw the opponent's I mean kids in general is just bigger and stronger and faster than they were a few years ago so what Bob Devaney said earlier is that it's hard to compare one era to another era so it's it's a good thing it's grist for the sports fans bill to sit around and discuss things like that of course there's no way you can come up with a conclusive answer but as we said before it's it's quite obvious this is at least one of the greatest college football teams ever put together two minutes and five seconds remaining in the game corn Huskers on top by a score of 67 to 7 Nebraska is going to take a timeout here with a 4th and 2 upcoming and exactly two minutes to go in the game and we want to thank our fellows up here George Hill Kelly Hays great job Brian Carter handling the booth with two minutes to go at 67 to 7 to Braska Memorial Stadium Lincoln Nebraska where Nebraska lead 67 to 7 Scott Livingston to do the pudding here any fair catch is called for feed at the turn of three yard line by the Jayhawks by Darren Green so 153 to go in the game there's one well a pan and will return to Memorial Stadium in just a moment ESCA top 67 to 7 with 153 to go in the game Mike worth is the quarterback after Frank's iron had gone most of the way and drops it off over the middle and taken out to the 30 yard line by Richard Estelle I want to tell you that the executive producer of ABC Sports is Rowan Arledge and coverage of today's game was produced by one Curtis County Junior directed by Jim jennette a technical director was less rice our Associate Director was John for Sony unit manager Peter gremlin Jack Wilkie our technical manager bill Monahan was a hosta half in his own right we assistant for the producer mins comes off here sophomore running back from Kansas City Kansas sort of reflecting the type of day it's been for Kansas know that nobody really expected the the Jayhawks to be in this one this one has gone very much according to the way most people expected second down to three they try the trough play here and it works free first down Berlin Bell takes it out to the 36 yard line of the minute 16 seconds to go in the game one thing that has eluded Tom Osborne despite the success that he has had is a national championship I remember that Bob Devaney had backtoback national championships before he stepped down the remained as the athletic director at Tom Osborne moved up the Huskers feel that they have been maybe unjustly deprived of a national championship over the last two years Clemson took it away that Penn State so this might be the year from the 36 yard line or go indeed banished al is open at the 30 yard line this young fella is having quite a day as a receiver Richard estelle a sophomore from Kansas City Kansas Kansas high school player of the year in 1981 his score their only touchdown of the game at 15 receptions on the year coming in and five so far today beautiful pass along the sideline by the backup quarterback and there it is a still no five catches for a hundred and forty kids is had some problems getting the next play off here so as a consequence to take a timeout we mentioned that Nebraska has broken the NCAA record were points in a season actually that number should be 596 596 points as we mentioned before breaking the mark held by Brigham Young in 1980 and that that was a team Li that had more emotional moments so Jim McMahon was reporter that's right mark Wilson's senior year was 1979 Jim McMahon was a junior in 1980 and he Believe It or Not threw for over 4,000 yards that season that is a record fact he threw for about 4,500 yards it's a record that I think will be around for a long time because Jim McMahon he's the only quarterback in college football history to throw for over 4,000 yards he did it in his junior year which was 1980 so first and for Kansas at the 21yard line and it still no the middle complete and down to the fiveyard line go Sylvester bird with 26 seconds remaining in the contest and this one going over the allotted time slot some of your local stations who will be presenting your local news to follow so stick around as this one winds down ball at the 5yard line Keynes is trying to move in for another touchdown first and goal and orth is lobbing it toward the end zone for a touchdown he met sandy Magee number eight for a TD so it's been a long day for the Jayhawks but at least some solace at the end here Mike orthe has really stepped in here and done the job sandy Magee running a fade route which means they goes straight up and fades to the outside and that is kind of the consummate touch and timing route as orth just simply threw it with a soft looping trajectory it has thrown to a spot threestep drop and it was it was a beauty nice job by this young freshman now call my heir to attempt the extra point no good no good only the second Miss all season for him and interestingly last week the only other mess came from 55 yards out he had to attempt an extra point from that distance because of three successive penalties 67 213 is our score with 20 seconds to go in the game Kurt he comes in at a little more acute angle than most soccerstyle kicker that time he was off but he has been extremely accurate and has set a big 8 season record for field goals 21 he's going to kick off here squib kick fielded at the 25 look at this almost broken taken a hat to the 44 yard line hey there's a there's the smile from Tom Osborne it's major emotion for done in Jesus brother Singh Osborne is a lowkey coach not rosier though he's not lowkey at all we're out here yesterday in practice these guys are not only fine football players fryer and Gil and Rozier but a lot of fun to be around good people we wish them luck great for careers and no question about that they can look back on this season is one in which ship they might do well in a national championship I just can't not win a Heisman Trophy based on one seasons performance anymore it takes a steady buildup of nationwide publicity and Mike Rozier began to attract national attention during his junior year that micros year was something special became apparent during last year's battle with Missouri Rozier was suffering a painful hip pointer and wasn't even expected to play but he hobbled off the bench and rushed for a hundred thirty nine yards to lead Nebraska to a 2319 win Rozier earned Big Eight Player of the Week honors as well as accolades in the locker room I think Mike was yours the best back in the country you know he can play with the hip pointer and gain 140 yards you know a lot of bags be lucky to get five yards with the pain that he was in and it just shows what a great athlete he is it's pretty obvious you know what he means to our football team you could you'd see what he could do the guy just makes things happen by himself there there just can't be very many football players like that at you know in the country Rozier began this season as the top returning Heisman vote getter in the country Penn State was aware of that and keyed on Rozier all night they held him to 71 yards but paid the price Nebraska's multiple offense shifted gears and pushed the Nittany Lions all over the field while scoring an impressive 44 to 6 win it was the only time all season Rozier was held to less than 100 yards in a game but it didn't seem to matter to him after all he pointed out this is a team game and the team won Rogier rushed for 191 yards against Wyoming and 196 against Minnesota and he began crossing the goal line at a pace that would eventually break the NCAA mark for rushing touchdowns in a season then against UCLA a two yard carry a spectacular two yard carry left 76,000 Nebraska fans slapping each other's backs in amazement and it brought nationwide publicity the play had more reruns than Johnny Carson's Tonight Show sports writers and broadcasters around the country got to see it over and over and in Lincoln his teammates began referring to him as Michael Heisman obviously it takes more than one great run to convince the Heisman voters and Rozier finished the season even stronger than he started it at Missouri before a national television audience Rozier rushed for a hundred fifty nine yards including this breakaway touchdown it became more and more apparent that Rozier was the favorite to win the Heisman then he strung together four straight 200 yard games to finish out the season 227 here against Kansas State 212 against Iowa State 285 against Kansas and 205 against Oklahoma Rogier had said another NCAA record the most yards gained in four consecutive games breaking the old Mark held by Marcus Allen of USC but more important than his own performance was the play of the entire Nebraska team that is something a modest Mike Rozier never forgot all season Nebraska finished the regular season with a 12 and old record and the number one national ranking that they started the season with it didn't hurt rose year's Heisman chances that the Oklahoma game was on national television where many of the writers and broadcasters in other parts of the country got one final look if there were any doubters by now it was Nebraska assistant coach Frank Solich who recruited Mike Rozier out of Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden New Jersey but he hadn't originally gone to Camden to recruit Rozier I was recruiting in South Jersey at the time was looking at a tight end that was playing for Pennsauken high school which is really right next to Camden and happened to one of the films that I was watching of the tight end happened to be against Mike's team which was Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden and of course Mike was doing some very fine things right at that time you know he was running up and down the field of course everybody knows what he's done since then it was fitting that Solich was on hand to meet Mike blows here at New York's LaGuardia Airport Saturday as he arrived for the Heisman presentation also there to greet him were representatives of the downtown Athletic Club in New York the sponsors of the annual Heisman award Rozier and the two other finalists Steve Young of Brigham Young University and Doug Flutie of Boston College were flown to New York for the presentation as he headed for a waiting limousine ride to Manhattan for a live network interview prior to the Heisman announcement Rose your admitted he was growing a bit weary of all the attention he's received in recent days the finalists gathered at the downtown Athletic Club Saturday night for a nationally televised announcement Rose years parents decided at the last minute to drive the 100 miles to New York to be at their son's side when the announcement was made after an hourlong buildup the announcement that Rozier was the 49th Heisman award winner was a bit a tie you
