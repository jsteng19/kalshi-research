============================================================

and it seasons back Oklahoma State will be kicking off it's clear it's very chilly there's no threat of rain the temperature is in the mid 40s and feels cooler not much of a wind in fact the flags are limp as Florida State receives the kick Keith Ross and Chuck wells that dwells on the right back to receive and Joey O'Donnell a freshman will kickoff for Oklahoma State again Florida State favored by about a touchdown most people expect this to be a pretty lowscoring game the Florida State has an explosive offense and Oklahoma State has Thurman Thomas so it may not turn out that well 41st Gator Bowl is underway with a ball in the air a wobbly short tic that has fielded up at the 13 yard line by the freshman Keith Ross and he stopped at the 22 and offensively now for Florida State a very young team going with the freshman at quarterback but a tailback they have Tony Smith then Cletus Jones is the fullback Randy white the wide receiver number 82 has not caught a pass and herb gainer is on the other side and we talked about the missing Hassan Jones and also Darren Holloman the two men who were a 1 2 and receiving this year so they're short at the Y nas pumps and goes deep on the first play and who makes the first catch of the season at the 33 yard line hurt bobby bowden talking in the locker room about getting deep to his ex Randy white is the xman that means the wide receiver on the left he runs the deep post pattern that's a nice way to break in if that's going to be your first guess make it a deep post pass Delvin Gilliam was covering on the play the fake draw and again at the 22yard line so the guy was in cash advance oil season and he's bought two in the first few seconds of the game upfront Lopez the offensive tackle on one side Cumberland is a 313 pounder Henley a spell 257 Jaime Dukes had made some allamerica teams number 64 and next to him is another good one in John 2:22 Ferguson picked off by Gila so he seeks the touchdown and Gilliam intercepts the freshman from Tulsa for a while beginning to the Gator ball what defensive struggle Herbert gainer number three is working on gillip he's trying to run a fade or quick up pattern the ball should be thrown high into the outside it's thrown a little bit too much inside that allows Melvin Gilliam to step in front of herb gainer the XOR split in on the left so they go deep two of three times come on the state after the touch back takes over at the 20yard line the Cowboys for their first year let's look at the Oklahoma State backfield that's Ronnie Williams broken jaw in the opener but came back to have a good year Thurman Thomas was panting the Heisman voting as a sophomore will Tim ensues the blocking back Bobby Riley has good speed and on the other side more of the possession type is Terry Weimer number 22 Riley splits to the left and Weaver comes to the right Timmons is the fullback Thomas is the tailback as well he goes in motion on second down and eight from the 23yard on again it's Tomica cuts inside little move as he moves out to the 28 yard line Isaac Williams number 45 in under stop up front jrok Dillard is the tight end then you've got Chuck Shanklin a 275 pound Derrick Burton is a 255 pounds Tucker weighs in at 260 Meacham a 240pound er and their best offensive lines in his that man falls player now Florida State with a football from the 43 yard line that's white in motion Ferguson has thrown on all four plays thus far and hits herb gainer and gainer takes it to the 45 now when I mentioned before most people think this will be a lowscoring game it doesn't necessarily mean a defensive struggle Bobby Bowden is an innovative coach he is a coach who likes to gamble he is a coach who loves the reverse and he has come out with his team throwing its first four passes a team that as we say is missing it's to top wide receivers second down and 10 Florida State at the 45 yard line a little bit of the old what they call Utah Pass which they credit Li grow stuff with inventing but more about that later as you look at the line in the linebackers gotta clear up some myths as long as we have the chance tonight Leslie O'Neill is a key man there and there is the Oklahoma State secondary you know the older you get the greater you were my college coach Jack Curtis was the modern architect of the play but we had such good luck with it in 1957 against the army the Navy stole the play and the announcers referred to it as the Utah pass they've been doing it ever since on third and 13 pressure this time Ferguson he dropped at the 44 yard line so the Cowboys putting the pressure on and the sack by Washington number 80 third down and nine Bill Richardson comes in as the Nickelback will Florida see by Williams especially from the outside but he gets it away and fine at the 39yard line heart lead dykes a heralded freshman with good size at 64 205 out of Bay City Texas who's been hurt a lot this year but he's back healthy for the Gator Bowl partly dykes is a freshman with tremendous potential 6 for 205 pounds good speed in the open field he runs a curl pattern and he gets sandwiched by Sanders and Richardson there along the sideline wiemer split left Riley to the right looking lemurs way and after the 46 on a flag is thrown so he did not pick up the first down he was about 3 yards shy but he may get it here because of the late hit by number 2 Deion Sanders right in front of the cowboy bench the referee Jim Kim rolling and it's a personal foul against Florida State so that will give the Cowboys our first down and also take the ball into Seminole territory for the first time in the game with heed 44 to play in the quarter Reimer runs a short hook pattern along the sidelines and there's the infraction it's actually Garth Jack's number 84 with the late hit that keeps the drive going Wimmer was instrumental on the first scoring Drive last year when rusty Hilger was the quarterback with patterns just like that Thurman Thomas of course was the leading ball carrier on that drive and was the exclusive ball carrier on the first touchdown drive of last year's Gator bowl game for the Cowboys on 3rd and 11 from the 40yard line those four the marker picking up the first down and getting a great block from will Timmons who all season long has been leading the way as the blocking back first out Oklahoma State this is a favorite play of the tailback in the I formation it's the draw play and a good lead blocked by Timmons his five McGowan first to the outside and as I said it's beginning to look like a carbon copy of that opening touchdown drive in the Gator Bowl game against South Carolina in 1984 Williams Jones alive and he was pressured and it's incomplete so the drive bogs down Garth Jax number 84 who was whistled for the personal foul at midfield was the man who put the pressure that time on Williams 2 yard attempt by Joey O'Donnell whose longest this year is 38 lives this one is long enough but it is why since not the accuracy and also a penalty marker is down at the 33 yard line as they run into her so he was pressured got to kick away and is the recipient of the flag let's see if he can see how O'Donnell was run into there it is right there by number I don't know about that call that was Robinson Terrie Robinson number 15 barely making contact with him and not a bad little acting job either here comes the call maybe we can take another peek at it so it's going to give them another shot it's a fiveyard penalty so they still don't have the first now the line of scrimmage is the 27 yard line it'll be a 37 yard attempt throw Donal again as long as the season 38 is still no good so he fails twice and the Seminoles will take over was 618 to play in the first quarter Bobby Bowden talked at the top of the show when we heard it in the locker about throwing a lot to the X and they've been doing that herb gainer the split end on the left runs a short corner or deep comeback pattern a chip Ferguson once again is right on the money I talked about the fact that he had a big league arm at the very top he's now 5 of 7 in the passing Department for 93 yards with that one interception as the flaw there but I see a little bit of Jimmy Jordan in the way throws and Kelly Lowry too for his toughness he's 6 to 210 pounds Furguson rolling gets it away as he's hit and it's incomplete leslie o'neill the allamerica lineman number 99 put the pressure on and still ferguson was able to get it away and into traffic and there's leslie it's 63 to 45 a senior will hear a lot more from him before tonight's out he was the hero one of the heroes of the 1984 Gator Bowl game he had a hundred and forty six tackles last year and more than a hundred tackles this season despite the fact that he missed one game after being injured against Colorado for 48 to go in the quarter window school Ferguson complete inside the 30 herb gainer to the 28 yard line and that's close to a first down melvin Gilliam making the tackle pretty remarkable what we're seeing here with these young receivers coming into the night's game they had a cumulative total of 12 receptions between them so it's the most inexperienced that Bobby Bowden has ever had at the wide receiver position coming into a key game what they're doing so far is remarkable Ferguson is 7 out of 10 he's already thrown for over a hundred yards and on first down Ferguson passes tipped and incomplete and nearly picked off on the deflection by Morgan ER the intended receiver good throw but sometimes Ferguson has such a strong arm that on place like that he throws a little bit too hard this is the deep slant in pattern gainer running a slant or post route covered by Gilliam number two to see that ball was thrown so hard and a little bit high that it was a tough catch it was catchable what has been a very tough cut second and 10 from the 20 a raucous Nick hit at the 22 and gets down to the 14yard law so Nesmith ramping up his career is stopped by the Me's Williams he's an interesting case came to Florida State flunked out of school went to a JC to get his grades back up came back was suspended for the first game this year and has been in and out as a starter all year good block here by Pat Carter number 85 I like Pat Carter at the tight end position helps spring Tony Smith but really it's a superlative second and third effort as he does a little pirouette right there at the line of scrimmage spins to the outside for the valuable yard stopped at the 6 yard line and the tackle is made there by number 91 Warren Thompson that's the play that Jessie Hester loved to run last year and we've seen Jessie has to run that for the Los Angeles Raiders as a professional momentarily it looks like it's set up well but he is unable to get to the outside Warren Thompson number 91 is the man who makes the key play for the Cowboys so now a 13 yard field goal attempt were from the 13 Derek Schmidt a 23 yarder and that's an automatic four on the man who has not missed an extra point in his career acquired they are in high school career and that was little more than an extra point in terms of distance the 28 to go first quarter the Seminoles on top three nothing from the pudding Ronnie Williams yard line and the cowboy fans want a flag and don't get at Deion Sanders and the ball both getting to Terry Wiemers simultaneously I think when Ronnie Williams looks at the film here you'll see that he threw the ball into traffic actually his swing man Thurman Thomas was wide open in the left flat instead he went to wiemer and if there's any one thing that sticks out in my mind so far it's the inexperience of Ronnie Williams as compared to Hilger last year who was able to consistently keep drives going with hyper so passing close to the 28 they'll spot it down at the 27 yard line he has stopped there by Darrell gray Thurman Thomas last year the MVP in this game Oklahoma State coming in and defeating South Carolina by a score of 21 to 14 this year third in the country and tonight he's carried seven times the 25 yard both teams coming in with a bar act of eight and three Florida State on top three nothing under a minute to play in the first quarter at the 39 yard line for a first down Hartley dykes much of the season thought only phases during the wreck of the year his second reception tonight well he was out with a stress fracture earlier this year he's rested now he's back in they had a form they expected it if they figured he was going to make a difference with a passing game we talked about his talent as a freshman six for 205 pounds ran a deep curl down the middle and now Williams has two straight completions after going to of six initially we start the second period at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville Florida Al Michaels would lead rushed up and out crackling Florida State leading Oklahoma State three nothing and Oklahoma State hands the ball as we start the second quarter so on fourth down standing in the 50 yard line and in the punt is Rich Thompson who averaged 40 yards attend why are the state is not sending anybody back beep as its angled for the farside bounces and is down inside the five at the two yardline Mike Hudson downs it there so the Seminoles did not send anybody back and it was a 35yard punt and in pins Florida State deep in its own territory as you look at the numbers through the first 15 minutes what's impressive about these numbers is our Florida State has dominated the game in the passing Department 114 yards 253 for Oklahoma State however in time of possession the Cowboys have kept the ball longer that's not too uncommon when you have a passing team but when you figure the number of completions that Ferguson has had that is a little surprising al were looking at the men who may have gotten a big head from his job Pistol Pete and this is senior Rick Wilson who is also in his last game and is going to show me one of the tricks that he's learned on the rain Rick go ahead I don't know how I got roped into this but back to you out Thank You Chet back on first down from the 48 you're in something it is Smith making the catch and a marker is down in the backfield at the 39 and as we all get roped into this it's a long story how much time do I have not enough clean up in Wireless stayed on top and a pretty good exhibition of his skills as he brings it out to the 42 yard line stop by Deion Sanders Thurman Thomas let the big game in Rupp during this year as I said earlier had the most productive single season in cowboy history it's the draw play or a delay that Springs him to the outside it's the same play that sprung him earlier he's out by the sidelines before Sanders number two brings him down 1550 three yards were his totals for 1985 out of bounds at the 46 and we might have a facemask you saw the flag go down and that will cost the Seminoles another few yards and take the ball into Florida State Territory the bass fans in the interaction with dykes making the guy thanks one of the most talented high school players in Texas last year gets his third reception on the night there's the face mask obviously by Deion Sanders number two Sanders considered the best athlete in the secondary however sometimes he's overly aggressive five yard infraction so the ball is at the 49 yard line first and ten to the Cowboys in a lowscoring but very wideopen football game third down and ten richard chin becomes the fifth defensive back for Florida State from the 49 247 Baili Scott and I Julius and there was Williams who came in number 45 one William shooting the other creating the shack and bringing out the punting unit keep your eye on number 45 Isaac Williams as he takes an outside move closes in on the quarterback gets to the blindside of Ronnie Williams he's the one who gets the first hit it's stanley scott number 83 who finishes him off earlier this year I saw Williams get three sacks in the game against Miami on quarterback Vinny Testaverde high kick backing up taking into the 29 as Deion Sanders the blocking does not form so he slips to the outside territory the 40yard line Sanders here's the crowded charges Harry Roberts suction sometimes this is exactly what it takes to get a team they're not moving the football is a big play by someone on the special units he's also a flag down though to negate it well in that case is not going to mean much but it's a good individual effort here by number two Deion Sanders and it was in that area that the marker was thrown which would indicate a clip under four minutes now to go in the half Florida State on top by a score of three nothing Seminoles came out firing going passes on their first three plays of the night the third intercepted by Oklahoma State each team has been able to mount a couple of long drives but nobody's gotten into the end zone and with his flee down Ferguson atomic dashing through the air number 82 Randy white makes the catch at the 40yard line Randy white the man who had not caught a past this season in fact in his two years on the Florida State boxing and he's caught four tonight for 87 yards and this one is a sideline pass he works his way down into the secondary curls to the outside makes the catch and then steps out of bounds to conserve time because we're down to 241 remaining here in the second quarter first and ten from the 39 yard line Furguson going for the endzone looking for with the cover that is the board here it's thinner who comes down with a 39 yard touchdown reception what's the concentration at the end of the year by gainer as Denise Williams appears to have the ball momentarily at pops out of his hands and right there is gainer to pick it away for the touchdown and the first touchdown of the night and as Smith who's been perfect for the pain götze throw at 2:31 remaining in the hand it's 10 to nothing Seminole down to the 40s over the middle and that's complete to the tight end JR Diller were short gain to the 40yard line first reception of the night for the tight end jr. Dillard who replaced berry Hanna who ended up being the hero of last year's Gator Bowl game so they shy of the first five five and on fourth down the punting unit comes in as long as the season is 51 they pitch it to Smith on throw number one expensive one 30:35 at the 36 yard line pretty good evening for the senior 81 yards in nine carries form averaging nine four rush Tiger was all run out of bounds in cowboy territory at the 43 yard line and things right now are getting a little critical for the Cowboys because the way their offense has been stuttering and sputtering they can ill afford to be down by 17 points or even 13 frankly Sarasota Florida who has kicked one earlier this evening perfect in the extra point Department eight 25 in fieldgoal attempts this season and as long as 51 so this one to be spotted at the 30yard line Kirk Coker will do the holding at the four hash mark and schmidt will try to make it 13 to nothing at the half good in this very long first half in the game we reach the half at 9:45 p.m.
