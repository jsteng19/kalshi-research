============================================================

but the present is zero zero laws regularseason records that stuff is out the door way how exciting to get another chance at the RAM central isn't owned twice today it gets real 'some as you do or dog first time we played around well got about the Rams I thought we're just gonna blow him out your mistake there have been some dark clouds over Seattle but that's how lightning strikes we have three goals you have a lot more confidence get in the playoff we feel good win the division a lot more swagger go to the Super Bowl no past just passion the playoffs you lose you go home Point Blank more than 67,000 inquest Field in Seattle hoping to watch their Seahawks to something they haven't done since 1984 and that's the longest drought in the NFL hello everybody I'm Mike Patrick it's great to have you with us the st. Louis Rams swept this season series with the Seahawks and in the process they scored 56 points yes the Rams are only eight Nate the defense isn't that great they're special teams aren't but you'd better be afraid of that offense Joe that often can spill just simply sayin hey kocha ruthless he loves that he likes to be called that that's the type of his offenses fast and furious he loves to put the ball down the field don't talk him about 5yard completions completions the big thing about this football team Marc Bulger threw for 450 yards last week Mike they need every bit of those yards to win this game today all right thanks Joe and for the Seahawks it is a different formula you've got to go the ground and one of the best in the game Sean Alexander ball well Sean Alexander led the league with 20 touchdowns and he almost done 1700 yards he missed the rushing title by one yard and against these Rams at two games he ran for 226 yards I believe he has to get at least honored 40 yards in this game if they do they control the game they control the clock and they keep the Rams off the field but most importantly he does that they gotta pray that the receivers make the catches thank you Paul and when we come back Suzy Goldberg joins us with one of the NFL's most successful coaches Mike Holmgren I'll turn Matt Hasselbeck to quarterbacks with hot hands of late and the running backs the break Marshall Faulk against John Alexander one of the most consistent backs in the NFL we're getting set for the NFL wildcard playoff game here in Seattle and as always the visa sky cam is here to provide the compelling views of all the action as the Rams take on the Seahawks at Qwest Field in Seattle Seahawks are in the playoffs for the second straight year under Mike Holmgren he's with Suzi right now well it's been a work in progress Mike Holmgren a Super Bowl winning coach but has yet to win a playoff game here with Seattle in six years how has that been for you well I take him a game at a time I'd like to win it I'd like to win one this year it would be very special it's been 20 years since he I always won a playoff game I think we're about to Rams beat you guys twice this year what have you said to your players to convince them that they can beat the Rams today well I thought the game here we had a game we could have won Susie and then and and we didn't but both games have been very competitive and usually turnovers decide the game today I'll be no different what makes them so dangerous on office well you know they have great skill at their skilled positions and they really believe in what they're doing so great players make great plays for them good luck today thank you all right Susie when we came back to Seattle it's the Rams and the Seahawks as the playoffs begin you said they're special teams stay or not Josh Brown to kick the avi√≥n case on their ugly and they stink playoffs are underway in Seattle case on from before take him down at the 24 let's Marc Bulger West Virginia University Marshall fault San Diego State Joey gets beat Notre Dame sorry big game volt alkaline estate as a Bruce University of Memphis Brandon Mahna Mahna Arizona Orlando face The Ohio State University Tom new Western Michigan University Andy McCollum Toledo Adam Zimmerman South Dakota State Blaine Siberia Colorado State the downside of the kick return team is they don't get good field position the upside is this offense doesn't need good field position mark Baldr out in the flat default let's take a look at the Seahawks defense cheeky okie from Purdue said the Twitter Texas Longhorn you saw more Huntsville Alabama Antonio Cochran I will try to get back to that defensive unit mammalton that was no gain I'll pass the fault and it's second and 10 for the and listen to the Stephen Jackson is into the backfield with fork and Baldr with time walk out of the backfield first down as it reaches the 37 yard line well the one thing about this Ram football team is that they get Marc Bulger an awful lot of time just take a look at the time that he has and I'ma tell you right now Marshall Faulk was not the primary receiver watch the time he had he just looks in the pocket there is a hole throw the ball look at the whole thing right on the gloves of Marshall Faulk and he get a first down that's easy for years has been such a brilliant receiver as well as an outstanding running back he'll go in motion this time Walter Tori Tori over to the 11 yard line this was unbelievable Ken Lucas and Michael Ball we're just got trapped with a boy between them the safety in the corner marshall faulk out in the flat gets that kind of attention you see him outside of Tori halt now up the field in the middle is michael boulware michael boulware has been told don't break on the ball til it's thrown I don't believe he can be successful unless he tries to anticipate a little bit if he's going to be caught in his backpedal all afternoon it's going to be a long day for that Seattle defense 52 yards for Tori hole who is number one alltime in yards per game for a receiver averages 85 a game Arne has 52 ABC's coverage of the NFL playoffs brought to you by Budweiser the bright color and crisp clean GMC trucks and SUVs professional grade fedex official delivery sponsor of the NFL and wild cherry Pepsi make this the wildest NFL playoffs ever with new wild cherry Pepsi it's the cherry cold Mike last time these two teams played in Seattle Mike Bart started that game with 13 straight passes already today he's thrown three so I mean it just that's what Mike Marx does now Mike hold on the other side he would like to get his hands on the ball and control it a little bit more but if Marx wants to keep on putting up with this offense it is he's going to force Mike hold him out of what he would like to do what he needs to do is when he told us two days ago that he was going to do that's the blitz Bolger and you can't just send five six and seven stephen jackson is the running back Bolger under pressure Cantonese the middle linebacker applied the pressure up the middle hi this mango look here's what happens this is the playaction pass here but they did d'lai back Kennedy's doesn't stay with it he just goes and when he does cheeky Okeechobee / King Dizzy's for the music the center of the line of scrimmage they're waiting goes right after both it is what they have to do they cannot sit back and wait drop play Jackson in pursuit by Seattle they'll take him down within ten yard line Marcus Trufant and Mark Juan Manuel on the tackle Jackson the rookie out of Oregon State not only the heir apparent to Marshall Faulk but split in time with him already now he may be the heir apparent but very few running backs can bring to the game the versatility that Marshall Faulk can do Stephen Jackson is a much bigger back he's 2025 pounds heavier than Marshall Faulk so you don't you won't see him split out like Marshall can and does Isaiah Kaz offense key is the injured Seahawk they have been devastated by injuries at the linebacker corps we'll be back in a moment back in Seattle amid chants of defense the Rams third and goal Lag down the lane was on the offense prior to the snap false start 76 and that is they're all world left tackle Orlando pace and that is as the fans are referred to here in Seattle as the 12th man the crowd noise here can be a big factor we saw it on that play it can also help Seattle's offense to slow down that pass rush once they get the ball we heard it in the opening I could hear you in the opening I don't know the Rams are going to take another timeout and that's they have burned on the opening drive we back to Seattle in a moment usually we would say the noise is a huge factor because we're indoors but we're outdoors in mark culture cannot hear then towards the ground from the sidelines seven defensive backs and checkin for Seattle balls here over the middle touchdown Torrey home they needed a instead of seven it's amazing to me to me I just don't think you can with the receivers they have and with the ability of mark Bolger to throw the football the worst thing you can do is give him time Torii Hunter's goes down and he's running in between the zones nobody lays a hand on him he just goes flying right inside and on Babineaux and boom touchdown they burned two timeouts they had a couple of penalties they had a sack but in the end ball four four four four seventy nine yards in the tungsten does he did he make the catch Mike that's going to be the question the fans went absolutely nuts and what they were screaming at and an hombre actually did he eat through it did he throw his flag he had to they're going to see if Tory Holt has possession of the ball when he goes into the endzone there's the throw there's the Paul Hanson catch move that meant the ground yet has it always has it that when you just take a look at his left arm and it's underneath the ball look at it underneath the ball high to those I don't know Paul I'm sorry I'm sorry right there it looks like the top part of the football gets to the ground you better have something more conclusive than that play and that is the key because it has been ruled a catch and the touchdown on the field so they have to find enough to overturn that rule irrefutable is that that's correct but I tell you what the thing that sells is for Torry Holt and you really you know give him a lot of credit he got that left arm underneath the ball and it just really looked like a catch here it comes again look at look at his left arm look at the ball balls on the ground the ball and then hit the ground if the receiver has controlled that is part of the rule I don't believe he ever really has control I think the ball hits the ground right there the ball is on the ground he does not have control of the football if I was reviewing this I would think that it would be an incompletion I think it's a touchdown in a while you get the dog right I think it's a touchdown because when he gets into this watch his hand underneath the ball now he's got his hand his under the ball the entire time here you go I think he moves his hand late Paulie Steve ball down now watch his right hand slide you know it would be nice after 20 in the 23rd game that you got one right I'm trying and I knew you wouldn't agree with me anyway so what's the difference tell you it takes a lot to overturn these babies well Walt Coleman now keep in mind Walt Coleman was the official in the championship game a year ago when everybody did a lot of bumping and chucking so you know he was and also the other thing we ought to note about this officiating crew this crew has been together all year we're used to the allstar crews that would come in and do the playoffs and I think that's a great decision by the league to be able to allow the men to work get to know one another and then work the playoffs together Torry Holt saying I got it they got the wrong hand under a story after reviewing the play the receiver caught the ball the ball did touch the ground but the ball never moved so it's a completed catch for a touchdown I think it's a good you know the ball hits the ground but Michael even explained it to you before and to everyone as long as he has control of the football the ball can hit the ground and that was that was just great work by threehole that's why he's a Pro Bowler that's why it catches everything in the area but the thing that really gets me is and then to past patterns to him how can he be that old I did say hit the ground no you're right I mean I don't I just don't believe and we saw both routes that he'd the big catch for 52 yards in the touchdown I just don't believe that Seattle can sit in a zone against these receivers in this quarterback this is the most exquisitely designed passing day usually in a ruthless Jeff Wilkins for the point after the Rams open fast the way they normally do it seven nothing in Seattle st. Louis with the first quarter lead 75 yards on only six plays three minutes and 27 seconds it did cost them two timeouts and Seattle loses one as well and a challenge it doesn't matter how many timeouts st. Louis said no never has my quota just like Selim you know eBay eBay put him on eBay for next week if somebody wants to purchase one of the Rams timeouts Morris and evidence argued Morris Shia the 30 let's meet the Seahawks off Matt Hasselbeck very minute boss Sean Alexander the University of Alabama back strong George Jerry Rice miss the Nevada State University the exact Florida game Petula Millie Leia Elementary Walter Jones Florida State Steve Hutchinson Michigan Rob Tobin wazoo Chris gray Oliver University thought oh man this isn't the state the Rams have come out and done what they do best now will Seattle feed the ball to Sean Alexander to start at all hasil been to throw on put his down as a little bit of pressure throws locked up in here and intercept the Darryl Jackson had a hand on it and it is intercepted by the rims Travis Fisher and that has been the bane of Seattle passing attack all year dropped balls the fact the final thing I said in the opening was and pray that the receivers can hold on to the football look at this this ball hits it right in the hands it's a magnificent interception but I'll tell you what you got to get tired as a quarterback throw these receivers and half drop as many balls as they drop especially when you hit them right in between the numbers you got you have to keep throwing but you're right ball and the Rams had only six interceptions all year long that ties for the worst ever in a non strike season so what a way for their secondary to start the player Jackson is the tailback cuts it outside after a hesitation takes it to the 35yard line it almost looks like Seattle defensively on the line has decided that they don't want to try and penetrate to put pressure it's like they take a step or so they're waiting for the Rams to set in to pass protection and then try and knock the ball down they're not really getting any pressure on Marc Bulger at all I call grin told us a couple of days ago he said let me tell you something we cannot get to this guy with four people we cannot get to this guy with four people they have a sense of people and they can't ascend it from the outside three wide receivers Kevin Curtis the third man in his slot Bulger pump fake picked up by can handle this safety and the secondary that had 23 pics during the regular season it's a huge one here Marc Bulger just doesn't get the separation he tries to pump fake and move Hamlin but he doesn't can Lucas is staying with just goes up against the ball makes the interception big defensive stand by Seattle they dodged a big rocks will take over at their own 4 yard line after the interception Marc Bulger still hasn't had a pass hit the ground but unfortunately for him that was caught by Seattle this edition fourandahalf minutes we've had three timeouts one challenge two interceptions in the touchdown what we just started that's right Florida have been and we only have only got four that's right now do you come out and run the football you try and throw it again without to Jackson Jeremy Chris Butler is there to help him down to dead what so often what makes an interception his teammates watch the job Ken Lucas I see him down the bottom just long enough to force Holt to hesitate to allow Ken Lucas to get over to make the play see him just enough to make them to hesitate that's a terrific job of a corner and a safety working together highrisk highreward Sean Alexander for a couple up into seven that'll leave them a third and two Jimin Kennedy on the stop for the Rams one yard short of winning the NFL rushing title 16 hundred and ninetysix yard a single yard behind Curtis Martin you know and that things all in the past now and and if you take a look at John Alexander where they really love to run is to the left for Walter Jones the allpro tackle is Hasselbeck throws and Jackson continued straight down the field and Hasselbeck through inside how about this when you're not even looking if you're Darryl Jackson you come off the line the quarterbacks going to throw you the football you don't even see it go past you I mean you talk about a guy not having his head in the game this is phenomenal now granted he's been hurt a lot hasn't practiced much in six weeks but still it's game time there had been some odd things with wide receivers out here Sean McDonald waits in his own 44 for Ken Walters punt driven all the way back to the 41 still looking for a block at the forty a long way to run the lose a yard let's check in with Susie well Mike what an eventful start for Marc Bulger four or five or 79 yards a touchdown and a pick he admitted as recently as October he stood up overwhelmed with the game plan today it is 300 plays thick consider though this just his first full season at a starter this is the most complex offenses football March telling us last night the metamorphoses this season incredible mark is seeing everything doing things in the game that Marty never thought he could Joe and mark explaining he used to be mentally drained now it's just physical Susy it's amazing to listen to Mike Marge say not only can I compare him with foreigner but he's better than Kurt Warner Jackson picks up a couple Tory whole told us there's more behind Bulger's quiet and demeanor than we see mark is a very competitive guy it's funny he's he's he's cool and calm and that's good I called him lukewarm that's good you gotta have that he would you quarterback but he's very confident and he works on being the best teammate and player that he can be to help us Torrey hopes a very interesting guy in a very bright very bright fella Bulger sent if he wants to call me Luke Warren that's okay vultures straight back to throw there's the Alcon becuase Isaac fruits fell down drue font actually had a shot at the pic and couldn't hold now this is the this is what you're going to see this footing will be different for the RAM receiver you see Isaac Bruce push up if this is in the dome his right foot does not slip out Marcus Trufant almost gets his hand on this one but now now all of a sudden Isaac Bruce has to think to himself alright I have to be a little more cautious when I come out of my brakes it may be dry but it's not that and Dave there they come they have to come protected well intended for kevin courtesy never saw it but this is going to be a hold I believe against the Seattle secondary holding 21 defense this is yard penalty and Lucas I talked to railroads yesterday had practiced the defensive coordinator the COS he told me he wants his young corners to challenge these wide receivers now remember this is the playoffs it was because of the playoffs that there was a rule emphasis change when it came to dealing with wide receivers and you know Ray Bob as he's affectionately called by his teammates says hey look want you guys to go out and challenge him well that time they sent six guys and they made Bulger throw the ball when he didn't want to throw the ball they got it can't sit there poor guys can't get off this line of scrimmage to get to the get to the quarterback when the crowd saw that replay and did not like the call at all and around Isaac gross beautifully played by Chad brown let me tell you something if you're going to run an endaround that is not a reverse folks it's an endaround and if you're going to run it don't run it at the veteran Chad brown run it someplace else watch number 94 stay home and then come back inside and make the tackle there's a guy that they had missed for a long time they have had so many injuries in the line back in position they actually had at one time three little linebackers playing 202 outside one inside and we saw chasm in ski go down earlier in this quarter for Chad Brown still has that great motor Marshall fought trying to cut it up from the right side he's in Seattle territory at the 47 michael boulware made the tackle Marshall Fogg obviously not the player he once was career lows and carries 195 and only three touchdowns for the few yeah but I'll tell you what I don't even remember Marshall Faulk this year I remember all the other boy boy I'll tell you right but I think if the Rams are going anywhere in the playoffs he's going to have to make his presence felt bird and for and balton by the middle Bonnie Barnard and Chad brown cut the middle Michael I'm sorry but this is what they really have to do now Jeb Browns at number 95 course coming up the middle but look in the middle of the field rocky Barnard 99 is the first kind of gets it yes you did and that's what you have to do with Bolger you've got to take him out of any kind of a rhythm that he gets into and Rocky's obviously been up all night working on that little celebration like that Bobby Ingram will go deep to take the punt it's a good Seattle bounce out of bounds near the 25yard line Seattle has stood up a couple of times on defense can they get their offense door through the NFL's top rusher Curtis Martin will lead the Jets against Drew Brees with Damien Thomlinson and the AFC West champion charger next here on ABC and two outstanding running back through it brilliant seasons Curtis Parton led the NFL wanted to show them a back over 30 can still get it done boy did he ever and l'Damian led the league in rushing duster I think LaDainian Tomlinson is the best back in football from the 25 Alexander picks up five to the 30 that was an excellent call by Mike Holmgren he needs to settle his football team down the first pass that was thrown bounces up in the air was intercepted the third time the last time they had the ball on third down you throw it to Darryl Jackson he's not looking slow this game down you cannot go throw to throw with the Rams you're gonna lose if you try and match up that way against five to go then he cuts it back Sean Alexander turn loss of five into a gain of five Leonard little number 91 is a great defensive end he's got all the speed in the world but watch what he's done remember 91 right there he was running by he gets himself too far down the line of scrimmage here you'll see him right here 91 is Leonard little watch him go by Alexander now Alexander comes back he knocks off his own man and Alexander picks up four yards if you're that when you're that fast and you you know you got that great speed and we've seen a lot of man I'm gonna tell you what you got to learn how to stay at home third and inches Seattle still looking for its first first down with 543 on the first quarter clock if you go back a week ago when it was third and inches on the goal line Mike Holmgren called the quarterback snake didn't give it to Sean Alexander I'd be surprised if he doesn't sneak this one as well with his big young quarterback and it was amazing to have people criticize him for that his first job is to win games and the quarterback Suites the best call that's what he called needed to win to be able to play here in Seattle the middle is open oh yes it was just step forward he got a first down Alexander will get it and have the first down let's check in with Suzie's flag drops Mandy got holding he's calling it on the defense they're calling defensive holding on a running play holding 79 descends five yards families in the end of the first down that's Ryan Pickett now let's check in the suit Mike the thought is why the heck wouldn't you be running Sean Alexander he's been a wrecking through against the Rams the season week 550 yards rushing week 10 176 that total is the most yards rushing for any player against any team this season Adam Archuleta called it the biggest slap in the face for a defense that's how you forge your identity by stopping the run Sean does a great job of finding the holes and when he reaches that third level it's a safety forget it and yet Suzie the coaches are well aware that despite of that success on the ground they lost the first two game and in the second game they only scored one touchdown but Sean Alexander gives you which every quarterback and every office wants on first down when he runs the ball he gets about at least for now you're sitting in that that position of second and six where you can do almost anything you want yeah and the problem is you throw to your receivers you're crossing your fingers and hope they catch they have not thrown a pass anywhere close to Jerry Rice so far everything has gone to the other side the Jackson and we have not seen corn Robinson Hasselbeck pushed down and more to the ranch gain of 17 I'll tell ya this is head up heads up but I'm gonna tell you something just take a look at what that Hasselbeck does here he sees there's no place to go and he sent something at the first half and I'm gonna tell you what's amazing Terrell Jackson runs downfield watch him he never looks back at the quarterback look at this he never looked not once now remember before when he threw it to him he wasn't looking Darrell Jackson needs something to get his head in this game Alexander well didn't that last one tell you he's not the primary receiver he does I'm not excusing it but he's not the primary receiver so he's not paying attention might forget about it sooner or later if you're a football player in between those lines you got to turn around especially if you are a receiver when a pass is called I understand was hard for me to believe I watched him run down the field and he never turned his head I'm thinking what are you doing and here's a guy they invested a lot of money in and he's had a whale of a year eighty seven catches almost 1200 yards they'll whistle this one did and it looked like porkchop Womack the right tackle moved early prior to the snap false start 77 offense fiveyard penalty still second down let's take a look at the Rams defense Leonard low Tennessee Ryan pinky the Ohio State University me Kennedy Penn State Anthony harder of Port Charlotte high school timely powder and Florida State Robert Thomas UCLA piece of tuna we saw more Hawaii Jeremy just brother Dallas Carter husband Adam Archuleta Arizona State and TwinAir Woods Clemson Travis fishing God the high school second and 14 and Antoine Edwards one of a halfdozen guys they've had planes free safety who picked him up from the Dolphins in the middle Hasselbeck under pressure first short to Jackson and Jackson pushed out of bounds by now this is headsup play by the quarterback and this was all done by him Matt Hasselbeck steps up he could have thrown a little dump pass to his left but he knew that wasn't going anywhere watch him he'll look and I season left now I'm not going to go there and hold on here's the land of scrimmage let me get it back to Jackson and so often quarterbacks as they scramble around they lower their heads and decide to run he did a nice job of disciplining himself looking downfield knowing where everybody is and getting the ball out of his hand third down and a long yard Alexander was the man who went Hasselbeck tipped up in here and a total immediately got a hand on a Jeremy for his Butler came in and nearly had to pick you know I want to go back to the beginning of that play guys Darryl Jackson didn't know where to line up on that play now there's the throw there's the right arm around everybody's calling for a flag melee does a good job of finding it and almost getting it watch it now they had to tell Darryl Jackson where to go in this formation he's just not in this game now he runs the route and he decides to look this time which is novelty for that's really odd isn't it Josh Brown will try a 47yard field goal attempt and got it so Seattle overcomes some mistakes on that drive to get a field goal and get on the board down seven to three while curve we can of course the Rams the Seahawks the Vikings and the Packers and the Eagles host the lower seed a week from now the Falcons will host the higher seed in the NFC and of course I don't think there is a single team in there that has a lock on anything or a single team that can't win I fight the entire end I think the Philadelphia Eagles have become the great question mark because since Terrell Owens got hurt they have not had to play a meaningful football game so you really don't know how they're going to react so you just are not sure what what you're going to get out of it I mean Green Bay could catch on fire heck if the Rams come out and play like they did on the first drive they could be unbelievable okay one thing about Philadelphia though you go see some defense I know one thing Andy Reed is not excited about getting to the NFC Championship game without going to the next level if he can get his ballclub there and then how about Michael Vick the Vick factor now who stops him maybe a vnk saw his deep hi short kick caisson on the run p8 runs into his own man warm of Seattle defenders close checkin was choosing well we got a little taste of why they call Tori whole big game already a touchdown today first receiver in NFL history with five straight thirteen hundred yard seasons he told me that it represents so much hard work dedication and fulfillment because it's one he dreamed about since he was a little kid watching Jerry Rice arc mom Lynn Swann and to be the first in history to do something with ball goes guys have paved the way man he says an unbelievable feeling and he wants to thank all of them for inspiring him and now Suzy's breaking all their records better break Jerry Rice's record not for longevity you're not Jackson dancing a little bit takes it up to the 28 yard line he is number one in NFL history yards per game 85 yards a game over Moss Harrison and Jerry Rice is fourth and all those guys thanks to Rice's longevity our contemporary one of the thing about these stats to me which is quite unique as every one of them is still active it's not one of the guys that happen that is played before every one of those are active players welcome to the same side Jackson behind Goodspeed lowers the shoulder takes it up near the 32 yard line wait a minute you know I'm watching four or five running plays down calm down calm down coach no no that March yesterday said the only way you win in the next football day touchdowns come from throwing the ball not running the ball but it's interesting Mike Mike's philosophy he likes to change the tempo of the game he starts out real fast now he slows it down sort of lulls you back in and in all of a sudden here comes the explosion the game for him has a psychology and my children it's a bit more methodical when they left six defensive backs in the game and you better send at least one of them third and three blitz coming they pick it up in throws complete all first down at the 45 might March a lightning rod for criticism but boy is he fun to watch run an offense especially this office well and you look at here you got Torry Holt oneonone and every time that Bolger sees this matchup you can if you can be assured that he's gonna throw the ball there that's the end of the first quarter of the Rams over the Seahawks seven to three ABC's NFL wildcard Saturday continues after this message and a word from our ABC stations official car to the NFL in the house of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots where they accept no other card to get you it visa it's everywhere you want to be welcome back to Qwest Field in Seattle beautiful weather for a playoff game we have been blessed no rain no snow more moderate temperatures and st. Louis doing what it does best racking up 115 yards in the first quarter and the Rams have reached their own 45 first and ten Bulger going deep again this would put turnips boy are they picking on michael boulware number 28 the rookie safety who has converted himself from a linebacker to a safety and the conversion is still in process that time Marc Bulger just looked off michael boulware was just flatfooted and I don't care I don't care who's running the patterns it matters who's throwing it look at the blocking and this offensive line you got four guys that aren't even close to him and he has all day to find your wide receiver Curtis down the middle of the field and let it fly 6 for 8 a hundred 42 yards quarter and one play from Bulger Marshall Faulk near the 1a keep in mind watch with Marc Bulger threw for 450 against the Jets just six days ago and to watch him mature people I think have to understand the complexity of the offense that is run and the rhythm that he has with the receivers this offense has no audibles in it everything is site adjusted and what I mean by that is the receivers in the quarterback have to see the same thing to make adjustments on the route great discipline great study habits are required to be able to fought touch them walked in from the two Joey Goodspeed led him into the hole and there was nobody left to judge Marshall fall you could talk about their defense with the Rams you could talk about their special teams but look at you see good speeds block there but you take a look at this offensive line and what they're doing I mean they just play you talked about five guys play as one they accurately play as one this is what Marshall Faulk lives for though to be in the playoffs to be a part of the offense we saw him get the ball on the first two plays of the game Mike Martz has made an excellent decision getting him involved early Jeff Wilkins for the point after both touchdown drives for the Rams 75 yards in six play and they have a 143 lead Marc Bulger has already had a big first half and he has led Seattle or a st. Louis Road or 14 League 143 lead over Seattle that drive took only 333 and Faulk capped it off touchdown run when the drives have 50 yard passes in them it doesn't take very long no or a lot of place to get where you want to go well that's been the hallmark of this team they don't take very long and all year long this has been one of the points in the game when they start to dominate that something really silly happens on specialty Morris after the 28th and the flag comes in at the end of it projects at the second that's michael boulware right there I want you to watch the rout of Kevin Curtis and then you look at Martin Bolger he's gonna look off to the left so it's gonna move number 28 there's the pump the safety gets turned remember he's a linebacker his hips aren't going to be real quick he isn't the centerfielder he is and he's a rookie he's a rookie who's playing a new position and is only this is only his fifth start and all it takes is one step in the other direction to open up enough of a line and these are not the receivers that you want to practice trying to figure out where they're gonna go and anticipate routes well Michael Paul were also told us yesterday we're sitting there talking day before yesterday we were talking to him he said you know I can't take any false steps he said and so far in this game he has done it twice where he's taking false steps and then false tears was exactly what Joe was talking about when Bolger pumps if he even here blitz is going towards the middle he's done and he's a very bright young man we'll get it Hasselbeck going underneath that ones behind in complete and Hasselbeck very slow to get up Mangrum had a seasonhigh a week ago six catches 79 yards really failed out their passing game here comes Hargrove number 95 I believe this is the guy that's going to hit him you know what that's got to be rough in a double them it's supposed to be roughing once the quarterback lets the ball go you're only allowed a step you can't hit them I mean you're right and that should have been roughing the quarterback if they're going to be consistent with the calls that have gone all year don't hit him in the head doesn't matter as for bet this one is completed over the middle X's in the tool Amelie he threw this about as hard as he can throw a football he he sees merely coming across there but watch him wind up Hasselbeck and throw this thing where and he had to get it there while you saw that go right under Ryan pickets numb arm number 79 it's almost like if he can't catch him I'm gonna make the next one stick to you : Robinson is him for the first time he is number 81 the super talented wide receiver for the Hasselbeck all day to throw gets this one the Jackson Jackson to the 48 this ball I believe his tip now Darryl Jackson has had problems focusing and looks like he's into the game now and that happens to people sometimes you get a little out of sync but watch this he's working working working this ball gets tip and he still manages to focus Darryl Jackson is back into this football game yep duska tip down seahorse into rammed territory at the 48yard line Korn Robinson is a player the lot of people love say it has just extreme talent and they've been upset with Mike Holmgren for what they perceive as coddling a former number one draft choice Mike Holmgren in his defense is cares more about this young man as a human being than he does is a football player although he would love to see him produces then he has been suspended twice by the team for violating team rules he has put in suspended by the NFL for violating league rules and they are just hoping that somehow at some point he is going to get it well they've spotted him problem for the Seahawks right now is Shaun Alexander has come off the field dangling his left shoulder he took a shot over on that last running play or the forearm he just he gets hurt right on this play that's art to let it come and flying up in there and then he gets pounded on on top of it and that leaves Maurice Morris the thirdyear player out of Oregon has detailed back as good as he might be he's gone there is Morris fighting for extra yardage and hands it inside the 40day what old Maurice is Maurice he's not John Alexander he's Maurice Maurice picks up a first down and by driving his legs and not stopping you till we talked about Sean Alexander Sean averaged 4.8 yards of carry maurice average 4.2 so this they can run the football the seahawks are very balanced offense and we're seeing it here a great mixture of run and pass at the 38 with ten minutes 12 seconds to go second quarter Morris this is going to be a whole door block in the back and it looked like it was the massive left tackle Walter Jones the guilty party I'll tell you what if it's Walter Jones you can't miss swing 86 offense 10yard penalty feel first family I'll give it to Jeremy Stephens the tight end but they threw it right at the feet of Walter Jones and if Sean Alexander cannot come back in the ballgame it would be a crushing loss not only for this game but any other playoff games they might be fortunate enough to be in this year I mean just look at the numbers well he's got 15 plus touchdowns it's it you see 16 18 16 20 but no one in the history of football has had 15 plus touchdowns in four consecutive years that's unbelievable in four of them have been receiving so he's a very important part of their passing impact as well Ashville back with a quick out that's only going to pick up a couple the Fabia Ingram and this offense the Seattle Seahawks offense isn't like the Rams offense they're there they don't throw the ball down the field as far or as much or as often as the Rams do so to pick up 20 yards it's going to take a good three or four plays now Mike Holmgren is forced to call in a few a deeper route than he normally would like to and almost with with Sean Alexander out so it almost eliminates the playaction second and 17 of 45's offense great back good protection underneath the corn Robinson who fumbles the football and it fell right it fell right in between his legs boy now you've got Robbie Toback going after one of the Rams after the play it looked like t know he's Samoa the linebacker it was you know what I like the way the officiating crew is calling this game we've seen instances where anytime a lineman would go after somebody on a pile a flag would instantly come out the officials are doing a nice job of control in this game but letting the guys play with emotion all right here you see some boy you see him number fifties right there and Toback comes up and just nails him wow that was after that where it was a real break for corn Robinson the dead ball bounced right back into his tummy and now Matt Hasselbeck will you Seattle second timeout of the first half Sunday morning join the hardestworking pregame show on television as Chris Berman in the gang get you ready for all the day's action on that F up countdown 11:00 a.m. Eastern then after the games at 10:00 Eastern and have helped primetime with all the highlights from the first round of the playoffs full day of NFL coverage Sunday on Sean Alexander has a left wrist injury his return is questionable they are seeing if he can grip a football and hang on to it the other injury of note Jackson who splits time the Marshall Fogg for the Rams has bruised ribs his return this question so here's what happens for the Seattle Seahawks you get Maurice Morris who is just in his third year if Shaun can't play and if you're the Rams if Stephen Jackson can't go you get Marshall Faulk in a more fulltime role of CV Ed's would be yeah I think so Seattle you would think that younger guy on the previous play due to the fight we stopped the game clock after a game clock stoppage we must reset the play clock to 25 seconds which is not happened we will give siano their time out back oh isn't that nice now that's generous it's Christmas right it's Christmassy all right there Sean Alexander and I'll tell you what you got another hand to carry the ball in he's going to be in I mean there's like this is it what do you know it's the set man yeah I mean you and unless you physically can't walk on this field but you know about that area in the far third down for Hasselbeck fourman rush over the middle 10th up near that dog again intercepted by JaJuan gross there is a flag down in the secondary that looked like a facemask on Tommy Polly okay this is a clothesline too because he hits Morris right in the mouth and in the helmet this is arm the helmet and they're gonna they're gonna not only they going to get the ball there it's going 15 yard us it happen before the interception or after there's the question does happen before the interception that's how the ball ended up back up in the air it was intended for Morris take a look at it here here comes the ball in the air boom Paulie hits them right there there's no interception yet and that's a facemask the ball was still alive personal foul grasp in the face last number 57 of the details while the past was in the air 15yard penalty from the previous spot and a first down to toll and not 52 Tomi Polly and it's a huge call because it's a first down for the CEO and it would have been a first down for the Rams with the second interception of the game yeah this was an outstanding I mean it was kind of an easy call to make and here comes Sean Alexander here's the plate just take a look at watch this across the mouth and that ball is still being tipped up in the air so that so they actually the infraction is right here by Falk now you've got a guy who's caught nine passes all year trying to go in in a playoff game and step up what asked Alexander is back in on first and ten Hasselbeck's pizza Bobby Ingram is a difference maker for this football team because he has been hasselbanks favorites really his favorite target this guy missed some games and when he was out they had some problem when Bobby Engram said the game it makes a big difference number 84 is Bobby Engram coming across look at this and it's just the perfect pass and the great catch Bobby Engram had some really good years in Chicago after he tore up the knee they thought he was done there but Bobby Engram can still play the game and made a huge play right there for a 19 yard touchdown catch in the playoff ABC's coverage of the NFL playoffs brought to you by Southwest Airlines proud sponsor of the NFL an official airline of Super Bowl 39 nice on everything we touch we ship and everything we ship we try and make better but like fresh smooth real it's all here and Cialis ask your doctor for free sampling cialis is right for you today's aerial coverage is provided by anheuserbusch Qwest Field in Seattle is yeah low line drive kick Avion caisson from the war timeout with 8:14 to go first half back in a moment No back in Seattle with two head coaches both of whom believed in the past but in widely differing varieties of passing attack mike martz was the offensive coordinator for Dick Vermeil when the Rams won a Super Bowl Mike Holmgren want his Super Bowl in Seattle it's West Coast versus vertical touches don't you love just talking to both open though that I mean they're they're almost opposites but when you said March to sit there was that little smile on his face you'll notice that some of his lean almost to the point of acceptance when it comes to their offensive philosophies they believe in it's so much Stephen Jackson is back in for the Rams goes to the slot in the near so they have five wide receivers fourman rush for Seattle balls are underneath Kurtis to the 31 yard line that will be enough for a first down and koota Feeney's the middle linebacker had to make the tackle and Kevin Curtis the wide receiver when they split him out like that now you've got four defensive linemen on five people they don't have a chance the defensive line Marc Bulger just slides around a little bit Kevin Curtis they really went looking for somebody to take aza Keim's spot when he left for Detroit a few years ago and Kevin Curtis has seemed to been the one to step up and fill that third receiver role said that Mike Holmgren won his Super Bowl in Seattle obvious balls are behind Isaac Bruce and nearly picked off on the tip Mike as events key Isaac is saying hey Marcus Trufant is you know pushing me around that's what Bray Rhodes wants the defensive coordinator of Seattle he doesn't want his young corners to sit back there and said oh boy that's Torey ho ooh Isaac Bruce I can't touch him he said go after him I'm moving down here by you my what would they really make those noises to second intent blitz coming they pick it up folder with a lot of time now he's pressured and throws it away there's a flag on the plane it's going to be holding there's another flag downfield also at the 40yard line and that in that area that's holding it that's right and at the line of scrimmage that's holding the other way I don't think this play is ever going to happen I'll tell you what's amazing is just to sit there and watch Bulger sit in that pocket and really not move and he doesn't own both teams illegal contact 94 knees in we have a personal foul chop block on the offense those middlings offset repeat singing down now you want to see a rule change the chop block we can where you can eliminate a guy forever in the game against a holding penalty and I'm gonna tell you what I do believe the competition committee will take some time to look at the the way the defensive linemen have been taken out over this year definitely something that I'm sure they'll consider but right now the bigger challenge is really lies for these corners for the Seattle Seahawks they're getting physical but you don't want in this story holder Isaac loose with Kevin Curtis going down the field so basically that was no play at all second in ten all over Jackson at the flag his eyes off of it and dropped it he sucked as a Pinsky about the same time he saw the football and casa vince key has two good elbows remember he went out earlier and was hurt now this one's wrapped up really tight I don't think he ever really focuses on the ball he's trying to make the tackle and you see him not make the catch this Seattle crowd has not seen a play 1980 talk about hungry people are starving did that and listen to him I mean it's three men Russian Bulger fix it in the Isaac cruise to the Seattle 49 I'm perfect throwing a gain of 22 boy I tell you want to talk about a perfect throw he throws this thing over two defenders in two different positions look down the middle of the field into the right watch this there goes one there goes the other one two defenders go up in here and this ball was thrown in perfectly you can drop nine and he's going to get it in and rush to you the thing you can't do with Marc Bulger is give him time to throw the football you've got to pressure ball you keep mention it but something they're going to have to do they're not getting there with four doublepump tries to run got back near the line of screwing Marc Bulger has been on fire in this first half against the Seattle defense young man out of West Virginia does a real nice job of throwing different types of passes what he does is he arcs it and then when he gets an opportunity in the middle of the football field with guns and he sees the field so well that he is able to judge whether he wants to put trajectory on it or he wants to try and fire it in two completions four attempts for nine years look at the completions over ten yards six of eight where they come they've already gotten to him three times Bulger throws this one out of bounds MacDonald was the closest man to it it will be third and 11 watts and this shows you what happens when you put the Blitz on Bolger the first thing he sees when he sees the Blitz or watch him move to his left here comes the Blitz he knows he's got to get out so when he moves out the only thing you can do now is just throw the ball away this is what I don't care you've got to put these guys two corners and safeties on islands and you've got a sense seven people Tom Newton is starting left guard who already had a big limping after that play and the rams don't have much wiggle room in the another blitz vulture side steps and throws complete halt hold inside the 40 dives and should have the first down boy did he know where those sticks works yeah I don't care that they complete this pass here they made bolt your step up this was story hole coming back but watch what Bolger does here he sees blitz coming they send him off he just steps up and again it really makes this play it's number 81 Tory hold watch him come back to him come back come back come back I got the ball and then he goes back and picks up the first down well they brought out to change to measure he's got it and they do have I'm sorry I didn't mean to question you and your ability may be the difference in two inches from here I'm moving back over by Jove different two guys made great plays on that route Marc Bulger with the pressure sliding around staying with the route and then you saw the awareness of Tory home this is a guy that has football awareness where he has to get to first he catches the ball then he works to get to first down first half just inside the Seahawks 39 Marshall Faulk nowhere to go grinds out a couple of check it was Susan well I talked to him before the game he told me this is a season of transition from being the guy to sharing time with Steven Jackson to then Jackson getting the bulk of the load he said the key now is just being ready to produce when he's called upon and guiding Steven without overstepping his bounds are overloading the rookie he said he is always deeply involved in the offense whether he's on the field or not his approach will never change even if he was third string he said that's just what's inside of them and Suzie you know the reason he's involved he is so smart he understands this offense as well as anybody blitz coming they throw it out too good speed and now an official waves it off in completely good speed was all the way out as a flanker back Marshall Faulk is third behind Jim Brown and Barry Sanders in yards from scrimmage per game and a head of Walter Payton that is remarkable company and that's because he was widely regarded as one of the best was receivers in this game and also so smart he knows more about this office than anybody else done except Mike Martz falls in with a man at his face grows thought he was hit early and that is what the Seattle Seahawks are going to have to do defensively they're going to have to let Trufant in Lucas as the corners step up and make plays Marcus Trufant in my opinion is real close to being a Pro Bowler had five interceptions this year as a matter of fact every one of their secondary people had more than four the two safeties and the corners but Marcus Trufant has got those really quick feet and great hips it's a very young very talented secondary and a lot of top grand choices back there Kevin stempky get used bucks the putter on the ranch pains this one high down the 14 yard line 23 yard kicked but no return let's go back to Susie well Mike a shootout was what we were looking for in the first wild card matchup of the weekend the last possession for Seattle looked like disaster another interception but no twas a basement first down and allowed Hasselbeck that hit Bobby Engram for the touchdown he calls Ingram the most underrated on his receiving corps and Ingram told me before the game he likes flying under the radar that's his personality not too flashy he hears it from the right people players coaches they tell him he's an oldschool guy dependable runs great routes what Suzy would this be a huge drive for Seattle right now 417 to go in the half starting deep in their own territory they get anything out of this even a field goal would be enormous we still don't know how Sean Alexander is going to react because he hasn't touched the ball since he's gone back in since the whisker grunting he's aware about the 23 first playoff game of the postseason Rams at Seattle from Westfield 67,000 on hand hoping that the Seahawks can do something they haven't done since 1984 the Rams won both home and away including a dramatic comeback in the game here I think Sean Alexander's okay looks fine doesn't he I want to make a point here Sean Alexander is going to have to become a righthanded carrier of the football I don't believe that he's going to be able to switch it over to the left side he likes to run left behind Steve Hutchinson and Walter Jones but he's going to have that ball exposed to the defense coming at him this is thing watch where he puts the ball memory hurt his left wrist he's running left and he still got it in his right hand now there are some guys in the league like Emmitt Smith that do that he doesn't he's a he and switcher so it'd be interesting and Morris comes in in his place Morris underneath a little check down looking up to see who was coming and appeared tommy polly was coming the line after it i'd say you know it for someone that's really not used to doing this to catching the ball enjoy it mention it you know you got Morrises comes into a ballgame and they you know they really don't play him a whole lot and then you put him out there he's gonna peak a little bit you know what though you expected hey i was i was looking at this way if you're dressed and you have to go out and play i don't care how many years you've been in this league you better know what you're doing well he only had 30 carries all year compared to Shaun Alexander's 353 Hasselbeck underneath gain of about eight the tackle by Thomas on the tight end at Corin Robinson are checking on Loren Roberts and that's a guy that they really need to step up poor in Robinson he gives him speed he gives him toughness and even more importantly than just catching the football he gives them the ability to block outside which is so important to Shaun Alexander's 16 almost 1700 yards he had a breakout year two seasons ago 78 catches with 1200 but his numbers fell off last year and further is still this year because of the various suspensions for man rush Hasselbeck date lapsim Archuleta nearly had the interception on the pass intended for melee at Ryan Pickett just broke down in the pocket he doesn't Matt Hasselbeck does a real good job of staying home here comes the pressure hanging in the pocket and then he gets buried now this you're seeing a little bit of a philosophical change by Mike Holmgren that was third if Sean Alexander is in this game and healthy I believe he runs it to try and pick it up there he was forced to throw can Walter the kick Sean McDonald McDonald from the 18 dancing and doesn't get very far Robbie tobik is wired for sound here's what he hears in the trenches keep blocking as long as it takes now hey as long as it takes hold him out hole I had a long conversation with him the other day and he is really a funny guy but I'll tell you one thing he says he loves to play this game and Hasselbeck was talking about oneeighth when at quarterback sneaker they won the game the other day against Atlanta we said don't go running over me the guy friend he's really too big I can't block him but that's exactly where they went Walter goes to the shotgun as we approach the twominute warning this pass too high and incomplete Rashard with a cover John McDonald we've reached the twominute warning efficiently a 157 back to Seattle after this coming up on the Lexus halftime show Chris Berman Steve Young Michael Strahan and Brian Billick take a look at the San Diego Chargers turnaround year and boy haven't they ever under Marty Schottenheimer and Drew Brees got a lineman a quarterback a defensive lineman in a coach I love you boomer which is still alive second and ten for the Rams who only have get him fourman rush in the cost of fall and marshall faulk will get out of bounds 25 after a gain of only three it'll be curtains seven give me an idea philosophies of both of these coaches st. Louis they have nine completions for 187 yards that's Mike Martz Seattle has nine completions for 97 yards that's Mike Holmgren you know let me look at it though you're looking at a density there's a team that goes downfield against the team that really doesn't I mean their whole game Seattle's within 15 yards of the line of they need it straight up the middle that time by Chi Kok fer when I tell you well keep her watch when he does 56 this is a stunt with the end of the tack illegal use of hands hands in the face 21 defense that is huge instead of the sack you've got a first down yes Kenny Lucas number 21 hands to the face but I'll tell you what what a what a just an outstanding play here comes a penalty Lucas now there it is his hands he hit him in the helmet with his hands so they call that okay now look at this Oh keep her coming up the middle look at that play they didn't they didn't see the stunt coming it was the first time in this game they had this fun and it absolutely worked and here's the thing that Mike Holmgren has to ask himself is my team mature enough to overcome a play like that they've really got a honker down now and play really tough defense after giving up an opportunity and this is a Seattle team that has committed the fewest penalties in the NFL intended for Curtis Bruce was also in the area incomplete with 1:40 to go in the half they had a whole lot of guys in that area and a lot of green shirts to take into consideration look at the division Seattle plays in I mean st. Louis is really the only team at that lines up people and runs them down the field you got San Francisco and Arizona in this division so and they these young corners have got to be smart with what they do so they don't get too I think play a lot of foolish football plus Mike Holman does a great job of emphasizing it to his ballclub regarding penalty balls are after that great starter said only one of his last six but that will not stop them from putting it up again more flags and this looked like early movement on the Rams prior to the snap false start 83 offense we will sing it down with Kevin Curtis the second year man out of Utah State it doesn't matter to them second down and 15 is so what I mean that that's that's your minimum route in this offense is 15 yards I think the the big thing here will be how Ray Rhodes the defensive coordinator of the Seahawks decides to play this down if he plays sown he's going to give Bulger a chance to pick up a big chunk if he goes after him he'll have to get it out of his hands quicker they look like they're having problems on defense lining up second in 15 drawn a fall that time he appeared to run right into the heart of the defense chant Brown number 94 led the charge it's the team that really in in a game like this and they don't they know I'm not going to run the ball very much it's hard to block anybody and Seattle has stopped the clock of the 132 mark let's go to Susie when the Rams were looking for the threegame sweep and they opened with beat game as in Tori oh my balls are perfect on the opening possession that ends in a touchdown Marshall Faulk says he loves the playoffs because there's nothing to do but win he practically walks in for their second score the Matt Hasselbeck keeping me Seahawks alive hits the veteran Bobby Engram for the touchdown 1410 Rams Natta looking for their first playoff win in 20 years all right Susan Bennett 32 to go first half you know we were showing you champ brownie made that last play and when you we first met Chad brown when he was with the Pittsburgh Steelers no you have to know about him you got a Pro exotics dotcom you find out the guy raises snakes and lizards and yuck I don't even shake any know that like snakes and I don't shake hands with him he touches the air terrible balls are pressured trying to run forth taken down at the 41 there's a half the punt Chad brown they really had they really have missed his pass rushing ability when he was hurt a broken leg Joe he is down on the line of scrimmage and he's going up against a tight in Monomoy LIUNA and the tight end really can't keep him out now you see Orlando pace come back and pick him up on on the backside but just the fact that he was there he's the one that forced Bolger to step it up inside I thought if Bolger would have kept in the outside he might have been able to pick up more yardage and Brown very slow to come off the field Seattle has burned its last timeout Kevon stempky is on to punt and the crowd is really psyched here in Seattle line drive kick the bobbing rope down a couple blocks flag is down Ingram stopped at the 39 an 11yard returned after a punt of 40 now Walt Coleman will check the penalty let's say what that flag was thrown as soon as Bobby Engram caught the ball there was an illegal block in the back Gerner return illegal block in the back 27 of the return team 10yard Bentley / fail Jordan Babineaux backup defensive back call for the penalty coming up hope you'll join Al Michaels and John Matt for the second half of our wildcard Saturday doubleheader the NFL's top rusher Kurtis partner will lead the Jets against Drew Brees LaDainian Tomlinson and the AFC West champion Chargers that's next here on ABC and Drew Brees the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year selected by the suit you have to wonder looking at the weather conditions out in San Diego it has been raining relentlessly out there I wonder what the fields going to be like and how that will affect those great running backs as well as the job the Jews don't hassle back the throw goes over the middle of up to the 44 yard line a gain of 17 you know you can still fall in the middle this is the time in the twominute drill in the first minute 10 seconds of this drill goat in the middle of the field because it mostly they leave it open where they're only lying backwards there you got a chance to throw one more in the middle Hasselbeck dives the clock will continue to run no time out now get up and spike the ball get everybody in the line and just spike the ball to spike it real quick there you go 29 with 29 seconds left I like to see I like the way he runs this twominute drill it's not crazy it's not out of control he's got everybody lining up quickly one of the things that I tried to do in a twominute drill was when I called routes make sure that the receivers are on the same side of the field if you're going to call a couple of plays so when they have to come back they don't have to run all the way across the field waste three or four seconds the numbers on Hasselbeck it was a big run nine yards but it brings up a third and one and they'll try to get the first down and do with Horace but with no time outs now you've got to try to spike it again and they did with 19 seconds left you know they ran it they ran a drop play and this is exactly what you were talking about they ran a draw play and everybody got back it only took them ten seconds it's because they practiced it over and over they're very good at that I'll tell you it really is it's it's smart football they have and with 19 seconds he can throw at least three more passes to the outside but he'll probably throw at least one in the middle and then spike it again and kick the field goal but that's the efficiency of a quarterback that's doing a good job Brown has a very strong look Hasselbeck under pressure down the middle and incomplete with 14 seconds left well they just wrapped Hasselbeck it so he just realized he had no one open and he had to fire the ball down the field nev seconds went off the clock now you have to be careful if you throw the ball in the middle of the football field if you throw a 15 yard completion you've got to figure it's going to be running down under 9 seconds I don't believe you can do that they're gonna have to work the ball in this case ball to the sidelines to give themselves a chance to be able to kick a field goal look at the defensive back sitting on the outside they're sitting on the out rocks Hasselbeck throws into triple coverage intended for engrams clock stopped with nine seconds to go but well he was going for the for everything well there's no you know there's no wind factor at all in this Stadium I mean you the flags on the goalposts are hanging completely down and on fourth down they're still going to try and get some more yards now Josh Brown has his 53 was the longest and he's won 41 this year from over 50 yards well this would have been 61 he kicked the 61 yarder in high school that was off the tee and now Hasselbeck trying to wind up so he can throw it deep and is taken down by Lewis at the 44 with one second on the clock now the Rams will have a shot seen out here here's a situation where if you're Matt Hasselbeck you've got to get this ball out of your hands it was fourth down on the crazy chance and of course this is professional football and crazy things happen now all of a sudden you're going to give those RAM receivers a chance to run down the field Marc Bulger throw it up in the air what can happen interference facemask a lot of bad things can happen to us touchdown yeah the only thing the Rams don't have out there are starting blocks that's right heading downfield and look at the Seahawks they're gonna put three guys at the fiveyard line and wait we'll be here when you get here Walter throws this one for Curtis and that's the kind of play they're hoping for a penalty so they can get another play our score here in Seattle the Rams 4 team the Seahawks 10 stay tuned to the Lexus halftime show with Chris Berman Steve Young Michael Strahan and Brian Billick after this from the NFL and a word from our ABC station Villa Contenta settling in after that original flurry by the st. Louis Rams I think back last year Marc Bulger in the playoffs against Carolina steed when Mike Martz wouldn't let him throw to the end zone with the game on the line they end up losing in the double overtime this is a different guy confidence and on the road he obviously trusts him very much more than last year and in the playoffs you can define yourself he's doing a great job he's been accurate all day long he came out hot here's the big plate of Curtis to set up the touchdown he's been hot schlong he's been accurate short he's been touch passes over the middle I tell you he stays this one this hot he's gonna get him in the end of the game he should be hot they're not coming near the guy at the defensive line you hate it you have to get past rush you have to make the quarterback throw the ball quick the drop drop in Chad brown the best rusher you got a cinder don't drop him he's no use of youth coverage send him rush him it for it's not getting it done sin 5 because not 5 since 6 make Marc Bulger throw the ball quick well I think they see a little bit of that the last couple series they did put a little bit more pressure on them and Seattle looked a lot more aggressive lot more comfortable the latter part of that half than then then the earlier part I'm impressed the way both teams responding to the challenges they both recognize that they're in a real game you know each other pretty well and we're gonna see what happens the last 30 minutes because the RAM trying to become the first ever eight a team to win a playoff game coming up on the Lexus halftime show San Diego has turned it around that charged into the playoffs welcome back to the Alexis halftime show Chad Pennington Jets arriving earlier in San Diego that's our second game Jets and chargers for a preview in San Diego here's Al Michaels how Chris thank you very much and I think when the Chargers put together their highlight film for this season they can title it reversal of fortune last year they stumbled out of the gate never recovered finished four and 12 and we're last in the AFC West and then there was really nothing to pretend any great turnaround in the off season but well Michele Tafoya has the rest of the story the draft was an interesting time for this franchise the Manning family said there's one team we don't want to go to and that's San Diego how did that strike you we talked to the Manning family three different occasions and we're told each and every time that we want no part of your organization that was very upsetting it was an embarrassment to the organization so we made a plan moved forward and everybody went on with their lives that plan was to trade Manning to the Giants for Philip Rivers who was tapped to be the future of the Chargers franchise but fourth year veteran Drew Brees who had struggled over the past three seasons was not ready to give up his post I can't control who they bring in here I set my individual goals and not one of those goals going in the training camp was just to be the starting quarterback of San Diego Chargers because in my mind I already was so what did turn drew brees into the player he's become drew has said coach I would like to meet with this squad before you do to assume this leadership role knowing full well that 50% or more of those people that are listening to you may be saying to one another what is this guy Todd Lee he's not even gonna be playing for us my whole intent for calling that meeting was just to create that belief that hey you know we can do it with a vastly improved performance this season Brees has been the catalyst for a team that went four and twelve just a year ago with help from new faces on both sides of the ball the man who came this close to losing his job has breathed new life into the Chargers it's totally different from last year at a so all you other people out there and I think the charges don't want to dinosaur what kind of satisfaction have you derived from all of this we're not the laughing stock we're not picking first in the draft we're a darn good football team or what proud of it at 12 and 4 the charges find themselves in unfamiliar territory the playoffs a place they haven't been in almost a decade once again no one's expecting us to do anything in the playoffs but that's fine we think we're gonna shock a lot of people as I told our football team this morning Michelle I said what we're gonna do our goal our objective is to win four games one at a time Thank You Barney shot never announced at a peak coach of the year congratulations Jim that's the late game guys adjustments you're at halftime you've done this a million times Brent what are you telling me Seattle's got to get st. Louis off the field on third down they've given up too many third down third and long situations if Seattle doesn't change their past rest strategy they're not gonna win the game they can't keep up with the Rams but if Seattle's receivers will catch the ball not look so surprised every time the man throws in the ball if they have zero drops today I mean the second half I think they win well we saw in the regular season in October it was the Rams that came from 17 down against the Seahawks can the Seahawks come from 11 down against the Rams turn about fair play it's playoff time see after the game town on ABC 15 desert Doppler to keep you ahead of the storm the Rams got off to such a fast start here in the first game of the playoffs but Seattle to its credit has turn around and cut the lead to 414 to 10 and the Seahawks will get the ball first to start the second half I don't think the Weathermen hit this right on the Honda button do you Michelle what is supposed to be stolen they missed by about 10 degrees thank goodness and if you're saying Lois you just have to be killed with that thrilled with the way the weather turned out Morris and heavens are deep Seattle Seahawks Morris from the five and cut down to 24 talked about the fast art st. Louis got off to I mean it looked like they could have turned this ugly in a hurry they really could muster that explosive on offense I think in this half what they have to do is go back to working the middle of the football field and create problems from michael boulware their rookie safety who was a converted linebacker and I think Seattle if they don't put pressure on the quarterback I'm IRA Bolger they're not gonna get anything done they were successful doing that offensively shall I now Alexander's got to get in this ball game if he gets in the ball game and he gets a hundred yards are gonna win the game so bad short Jenkins at the Steven let's go to Susie before the half mark will make the adjustments now you'll see more of a regular mix and they expect the secondary to back up a little bit probably to give them a little bit more room as for Mike Holmgren he was surprised that given the interceptions and the tipped balls that his team was still in and he said they just have to improve on field position all right Susie and of course that's a big battle for them because as we pointed out before this is not your typical big play offense the West Coast usually has its own version of grinded out what really kills it is when receivers drop balls that's the thing that really sets this offense back if you're only going to throw six and seven yard routes then you've got to be able to complete those passes we've got an injury timeout is starting right garden Chris gray is down for the Seahawks ABC's coverage of the NFL playoffs brought to you by dodge you can take life as it comes or you can grab life by the horns dr. pepper your local Dr Pepper bottler dr. pepper one taste and you get it autotrader.com sell your car fast on the ultimate automotive classified site and Southwest Airlines proud sponsor of the NFL an official airline of Super Bowl 39 and today's aerial coverage provided by anheuserbusch that's a pretty stadium in it really util Paul the owner of the Seahawks did a wonderful job one in an outdoor stadium medic waiting Hasselbeck quickly underneath Jackson moved to get three first down the Rams 47 point is Matt Hasselbeck know this offense Darryl Jackson all of a sudden is in this game we saw him drop the first pass to him it looked like the first two series his head wasn't in it now all of a sudden he sees the blitz adjustment makes the move and gets away from three Rams before to get to him well that's that's you talk about a confidence builder for a quarterback and a wide receiver Seattle moving the ball this point to start the third quarter pass it back again underneath to a tool Amelie incomplete first half numbers 224 total yards for the Rams who usually win the statistical battle right now they're winning the battle on the scoreboard as well rushing yards 71 for the Seahawks they'll probably need more domination than that and Chris gray being taken a locker room on the cart that is not good new along their offensive line get a report on him as soon as possible Alexander injured a left the risks in the first half taken down by Anthony Hargrove who not only played off the blocker and struck out the play he made the tackle yeah well take a look at who he beats Walter Jones number 71 who's the tackle this guy just look at this look at this play he makes he not only beats Walter Jones gets heartbroke our group gets in the backfield and gets Sean Alexander 33 yards not for this guy this guy's got to get 150 yards so three yards in carry 40 ok total yards a carry average 4.8 during the regular season and that won't get it one national pact over the middle and that decorum robinson near the 35 it's enough for a first down joe it just looked like okay Hasselbeck looks at to the outside to his left that he sees match back strong anything I'm not throwing to him he's not going to get the first down now go downfield you know it makes that play though is the job that Walter Jones did giving him protection corn Robinson does a nice job is sitting in the hole also both of these quarterbacks Matt Hasselbeck and Marc Bulger know exactly where everybody is on the football field and now the Rams are going to have to burn another timeout on defense on first and ten back to the Seattle in a moment st. Louis on top of Seattle 14 to 10 but the Seahawks are driving they have reached the RAM 35 yard line Matt Hasselbeck 13 out of 24 after a very slow start and some of those incompletions weren't his fault he was just bouncing off the hands of his receivers so back out in the flat to Robinson fumbled the football out of bounds what a break for Seattle kourin Robinson has had two breaks he's fumbled the ball twice and it's been out of bounds but keeping the drive alive Matt Hasselbeck does an excellent job on the pass before this it's third and 13 that's corn Robinson that's back strong in the back field strong goes out Robinson hooks he looks out towards strong and then fires up the field look out to the left turn step up fire the completion for the big first down and if you wonder you glad the ball it's second down in about four you cannot crumble the bog forward Alexander hit from behind dive forward inside to 25 and with that party and in that yard but that's you know this team really is now the Seattle Seahawks offensively you talk about playing with confidence look at here look at this blocking but I'll tell you one thing about Shaun Alexander he has got quick feet and he can get back inside and find the hole you just have to be careful with him having to carry the ball on his right hand all the time Ashville back underneath to a true love me immediately close to another first down you talk about a quarterback week talk about quarterbacks in a rhythm right now Matt Hasselbeck is setting his back foot and getting the ball watch how quickly this ball comes out of his hand I mean it is gone in a heartbeat it to Lou melee does a great job of getting his head around a notate all right Sean Alexander that is Adam Archuleta coming in on the Blitz and he just takes him down this will be first down Seattle near the tip back strong that's your wedge just wedge the middle of the football field give it to the fullback and let him get the momentum going it will be first and goal from the 9 there's one of the things that always amazes me about fullback when they touch the ball like four or five times a year and in a crucial situation to give it to him and expect him to hold on to the ball max strong is a special one though Hasselbeck quickly to Jackson Jackson to the five Ramis Fisher makes the tackle but right now Seattle having everything its way and this is the essence of that quick passenger and have it and get yourself in a rhythm and we think when we talk to them on Fri our excuse me going on Thursday the thing they talked about and Gil Haskell their offensive coordinator told me when we get an opportunity to get points on the board we have to score and I said do you have to be escorted empty since all we just got to get points on the board and eat the clock drive approaching five minutes as effect on the been read back at the 7yard line and there was absolutely no one to throw the ball to Robert Thomas and Bryce Fisher combined to get him look at look at here he's looking for Jackson the Jackson's on the outside there's absolutely no place to go but more has him covered but everyone else was covered Hasselbeck did really the smart thing eat the football the worst you want to come away here was his with 3c I really think this is a great throwing formation when you bring in a bunch of tight ends you bring in a couple of tight ends right and that was in the backfield he's a viable motion guy you move people around third and goal now you're gonna have more room yes gives you five more yards of room prior to the snap false start 77 off the fiveyard penalty fill third now we take guys coaches get mad because of a penalty like that but it says much on the sidelines as it is on the quarterback if the coach doesn't know what package he wants on the field it just takes so long to get there good job setting by porkchop Womack but now third and goal from the twelve Jerry watch number 70 was in there for the engines Chris gray has been begging the Walker pretty defensive play by Diwan grouse who came over the top and batted it down I don't even understand the throat I forget to throw if they had any confidence he to intercept that this had gone the other way heat breaks great on this ball I mean that's an interception from a defensive personnel look he is right there next to the receiver this defensive secondary has so few interceptions that I think they're afraid to take a chance and go after the ball 30yard field goal try coming who would make it a onepoint ballgame Brown has already hit from 47 and he's perfect on this one so with 852 to go third quarter Seattle has cut the lead to one we're the beautiful city of Seattle where Saint Louis leads it by one here at Qwest Field and has been a problem for the Seahawks in the red zone against the Rams they've been there seven times and have only two touchdowns to show for it the other five times they had to settle for field goals avy on caisson deep for the kick across the 30 in rare good starting position for the Rams let's go to Susan we spent some time with Mike Martz last night he told us that he is closer to this team than any he's been associated with and he told us it's because they were babies when they came in 47% of his team has three years or less experience it's a great opportunity to get them going in the right direction and he says they're such good guys kind of an unusual locker room little division it's a group that's very connected they play for each other and they've bought into the unselfishness they really have to rely on each other they don't want to let each other down Susie I know he gets a lot of grief from people but is there a more exciting offense to watch anywhere balls are dropped by two Jackson when Jackson has been sort of reticent to put his shoulder down and go dancing a little bit and there's Mike Martz who was best described I think a couple of years ago as a ruthless play call if he gets you down by 10 and has a chance to get you down by 20 and then 30 he's going to do it he's very unpredictable as far as down in distances go he's not afraid to take a shot on third and long third and short second and six I really believe they have to challenge the secondary again Seahawks Show Blitzen come with it Jackson on the draw got maybe a yard that's it he just judges the pace of the game Mike March does when you you're standing there saying right now boy looks like he's really gone I'm ready to throw and all of a sudden oh come out and run four plays in a row but I'd say I like what they just did Seattle Kenny Hamlin number 26 the free safety came on a blitz and he's the guy that made the play I mean you've got to come from everywhere when you're playing this team you cannot let vultures sit in that pocket and get relaxed again six defensive backs on the field for Seattle and Marc Bulger trying to get Jackson in the right place and Jackson doesn't want to go made to take their second time out that's the downside for rookies in a complicated offense 7:21 to go third quarter it is almost deafening in here middle of the period and st. Louis has already burned two of its time out something we have seen his store and you just can't keep doing it gonna catch up to me sooner or later Baldr to hold and Torry Holt will have a first down up at the 46 how do you quiet 67,000 people just like that in a matter of a second just like that throw a completion for a first down look at mark ball tree yeah everything about him is mr. cool and Tory Holtz the same way see how he looks in reads the defense I really enjoyed the conversation with him last night when he talked about running 3 or 4 different kinds of eight patterns now eight patterns are post and they're run at different levels and it's all done by reading five catches 99 yards for hole Bulger wants the screen got into Jackson but Jackson didn't have a chance because of Marcus Trufant on teh what goalkeeper is the guy he is in the backfield he doesn't take the fake they run up a draw and a fake draw and they're going to run a screen pass to the outside oke first stays on the outside makes his play and then Trufant makes the tackle left of your screen watch boom let's go Kieffer in his face and then the throws made and Trufant make the tackle that's just perfect defense in Marshall Faulk is in the game now I just think that he's a guy that's got to touch the ball more in this half blitz coming Bulger unloads the Curtis looking for a blockin hasn't turned us inside that 30 to the 26 yard line you can blitz you can get pressure but if you don't get there these guys can meet you alive he gets the ball Marc Bulger gets the ball out of his hand so quickly watch up top he sets the quick post he's inside on Rashard and it's a footrace and you're not going to win a lot of foot races with Kevin Curtis and it's not like Mike Martz doesn't care if Marc Bulger gets hit on the pressure he just says he can get rid of it so fast to the right guy they're not going to get there anyway bulbs are under pressure this time somehow got away and then doesn't get away the second time he's nailed at the 28th Chad brown comes in and drops his shoulder and he hits Bolger number 94 is going to be the guy at the end of this play here comes these limite this is not a blitz either this is just a fourman rush what's that that's Chad brown here comes the head like it drops his shoulder whoa boy what shot right cross I mean that baby hurt trust me that will hurt and as a quarterback the first thing you want to do straighten your helmet and get up as quick as you can even if you can't see and connect in your last timeout I'm sorry Joe but this is the last timeout for the ring well this may be a timeout called because Marc Bulger is still trying to figure out where he is with 441 sicko third quarter we're in Seattle st. Louis by 1 441 to go third quarter here's what happened on that last timeout Marc Bulger using the third and final timeout you see him signaling let's get a play in here Tori hopes it come on you got to get something in play clock winding down Bulger uses a timeout they have none left now if there's a controversial play they can't challenge it they're out of timeout here's the play before where chant Brown just had loads on him and Mike Martz went after the official said he got hit in the head with an elbow this is what happens when you have 200 pass plays in your offense you can sometimes outsmart yourself and that's one of the thing Mike smarts talked about trying to do too much as a coach make too many changes committee adjust on the outside second and 12 blitz coming holy cow artisanal left everybody else standing flatfooted argue it well rocky Bernard number 99 watch him he's going to go I got him no I don't have him maggot whacked by my own guy Kent Hamlin with the same route watch number 26 come in late there's one there's the other I think in gate when you're in the playoffs Marshall Faulk has got to get more time on the football field big third down here third and five fogs in there with hoods feet in the backfill behind Bulger balls are underneath hope gave up the first down and then got it back what a dangerous move by Tori hole I tell you one thing here we're sitting up here looking and you're looking in the middle of the field and all of a sudden you see a guy on the righthand side of his field come I'm covered nobody's around I'm at F number 81 Tori hole how can he be that free here he goes he fence to the outside he loses the defensive man and look at how clear he is here is the green shirt around him look it here back to the inside and there's really nobody on him sometimes you have to give credit to a very well designed as well and that was an excellent well six catches 108 yards for a hole balls are in trouble and down goes gko Kieffer again has him at the toilet three minutes 15 seconds to go the first NFL playoff game of the year and the Rams hanging onto a onepoint lead trying to extend it here but now facing a second and 19 this has been a fast third quarter and the st. Louis Rams are without their timeouts tej used in the third corner which could be a big factor towards the end of this game all Jesus throws this one away making sure he doesn't take the sack or make the big mistake down see island having the Rams in third down and 20 or 19 to me is a scary proposition because now if you play the zone like they did early in the game on the first drive he hit story hole in the middle of the football field behind the line back in front of the safeties you've got a rookie safety in michael boulware play in there and that's the guy i think they would want to try an isolate the ranch could conceivably get a first down it would be inside the one falls into the end zone too high for a hole into a TT locus was there and Christmas yard that was there and here comes the field goal unit this is just outstanding coverage on look at this Torry Holt goes in and he runs right into the safety I mean this is outstanding coverage but Isaac Bruce was open and Kenny Lucas got his hands on him he's gonna have to be careful you can't touch the receivers downfield when the balls in the air Jeff Wilkins from 38 yards and the Rams regained in a fourpoint advantage 1713 in Seattle 235 to go third quarter check in with Susie well Mike the Rams looking for that threegame sweep of Seattle on the first possession Marc Bulger was a perfect floor for four and he ended by going to Tori big game holders been huge game six catches 108 yards the seahawks answered with a Josh Brown field goal and then it was Marshall Faulk walking in from the one Matt Hasselbeck keep in a minute hits his veteran Bobby Engram for the touchdown another Josh Brown field goal Jeff Wilkins adds one more and that's where we stand in the third quarter 1713 Rams all right Susie 2:35 to go third quarter Seattle has evened up the statistical battle and it's only four points on the scoreboard why is it every year we get a wild card game it's always a great win it's a wildly I'd say a lot of times I mean I think that the Jets and San Diego game remember sandy Jets beat San Diego earlier this year one of the few teams I was were as able to do that what's the weather going to be like in San Diego it's a beautiful day here in Seattle though how many times do you get to say that it's a beautiful day here in Seattle and it's raining cats and dogs in Sandy a 25 regular season games played in this stadium and they've never had bad weather Morris from the six cut down at the 24 last season in the playoffs the Seahawks and the Packers ended regulation tied in a very confident Matt Hasselbeck guaranteeing the Seattle score during the overtime point off not a good poke then the Packers al Harris intercepts Hasselbeck and returns it for a touchdown and a 33 27 that wind and that stays with you through the entire offseason it's the last row that you name in that year of O 3 it's the last row and today is a tremendous opportunity to put that pass far far behind screen Alexander nice run by Sean Alexander here the football give Alexander but you want to see it a play that you don't ever want to see when you're in the media room with the players Antoine Edwards number 42 watch the mood that Alexander does on him not there right here think back it's that all you got what's it one arm on them and you're not going to bring you Alexander down one arm and anytime you drop your head trying to make a tackle 95% of time you're coming up with a half a leg and a lot of hair first catch for Seattle running back one way the other and Fisher just unloads on Darryl Jackson seven caches 62 yards this afternoon good game for Jackson and here comes Hasselbeck with that efficiency again he just seems to get himself into a rhythm and when he does he looks to the sidelines and he's saying hey Mike give me to play oh he knew it to be a little sooner that's why Mike gets when Mike Holmgren wanted him from the Packers he wanted to be as ordered coaches giving that Alexander stood straight up by picking March 11 Sean Alexander cannot have the impact for the Seattle offense that he has had all year because of that sore wrist everything he's doing he's either protecting a little bit when he's running or having to protect the football in an uncomfortable way carrying it just in his right arm so he's about I'd say 85% of where he was coming into this ballgame Morris checks in for him on third and fourth time running out third quarter back under pressure pro who needs that'll be a first Jackson with another kid what a beautiful throw we're talking about rhythm and where he steps up gets planted and Hasselbeck throws the ball just look at this pass this pass is absolutely perfect he is the only guy Jackson's the only one who can get their Butler had no chance what's surprising is Matt Hasselbeck's completion percentage is below 60% he's 58 9 and when you see the way he sets in the rhythm that he gets in sometimes you scratch your head and say how that's the end of the third quarter the Rams lead the Seahawks 1713 ABC's NFL wildcard Saturday continues after this from our ABC station ready to start the fourth quarter in Seattle where the Seahawks are down by only four 20 years since the last postseason when they beat the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984 Alexandra for those of you are wondering yes Jerry Rice plays on the Seattle Seahawks football team and yes Jerry Rice has been on the field for most of their office and no they have not thrown one ball in his direction very unusual role for Jerry Rice to be a part of an offense through three quarters and not have a pass thrown to you but a credit to his professionalism as he continues to run the routes hard and help this ballclub Hasselbeck the al so that should be another first down day when I got to see this again for this mark this I mean you got to understand some Jackson this coming back to the ball let's just take a look at that line is not really true true true true true alright he's up in the air and now if he comes down he comes down on about the line but keep in mind there are the Rams do not have the ability to challenge so it wouldn't matter because he could challenge the mark as somebody again goes for the end look like the same ground that we saw Bobby Angra make the touchdown reception on in the first growth by two steps 10 catches 100 Darrell Jackson starting from the right side you see him there he is coming across in the round the one now there it is again Duan gross was the same guy that they beat with the same route but with a different person earlier in the class to throw man off and Darryl Jackson was the same guy that started the game running down the field and not even turning his head around to see where the ball was he certainly changed him Seattle to the delight of 76,000 has taken the lead 22:17 here at home seven plays Symphony six yards three minutes and 15 Hasselbeck to Jackson and Darryl Jackson the 10 catches 106 yards of Seahawk record in a play hey son to the 30 I want you to notice what Darryl Jackson does but I want you to pay attention to Jerry Rice that's Darrell Jackson that's Jerry Rice Jerry Rice is going to go down and clean out both of the defenders and Darryl Jackson is just going to go right across the field to the voided area this is the job that Jerry Rice says running hard taking the defenders it allows Darryl Jackson to go into a voided area in front of Dhawan gross and wind up with the touchdown nice throw also when that Haskell why's his career high 10 catches stephen jackson we're running back behind Bulger Isaac Bruce at the 37yard line only his second catch today I like you know Isaac Bruce you want to know why he's been around and catching so many balls why cuz when I think Bruce catches the ball there's no reason for him to take a big blast then get one more yard he knows he has no room to run he just catches the ball and goes right foot right down now second down he can play another play Jaxson I want a nice job by Chad Brown just a really nice job you don't have to go up and lay a big hit on people sometimes all you need to do is use your hands keep the blocker away from you and just slide them right out of bounds there are about two yards shy but it doesn't great job with Adam Timmerman coming around trying to block them that he can't get the outside third and two and on third down Marc Bulger has converted 75% of the time Jackson first down and they do it the oldfashioned the non RAM way on the ground well I'll tell you what and you want to eat Jackson on that last play Steven Jackson just showed you how much power he really has this is a big man because he was hit in the backfield and still picked up four yards on the play now he's almost a full yard below his average he averaged five yards of carry which was the leagueleading average this year so the Seahawks from a running standpoint are doing a good job first down Rams afford him for you Walter with plenty of time tipped them incomplete Bruce got a hand on it Curtis was also in there I'd say well I see a lot of patterns of this team has but I don't ever remember seeing two guys in the same spot and when you do that you have a whole lot of Granger in the same area they're criss cross and in the middle when when Marc Bulger throws the ball in the middle of the football field it's almost like watching Michael Jordan take a jump shot you just hold your breath because it's either going to wind up beautifully landing in someone hands or there's going to be like Cole mentioned a lot of people moving through one little area second and ten play fake to Jackson falls over with time underneath the near fit man Chad brown again here bye yomomma you know you're going to have Kenny Lucas again and and it's totally away from the play he is on Isaac Bruce and they threw a flag over here and it illegal contact 21 days in where you've got a had him in third and tenth situation and just in Kenny Lucas remember in the playoffs last year is where the rule emphasis was created Walt Pullman's group this his he was the referee in the Indianapolis game or guys words were being mud with Indianapolis and in New England and so and it's a rule emphasis that's out there and I'm just wondering how we will play out through the entire playoff picture not just in our game we've seen a play a part in this one already and Seattle has done a brilliant job all year long the least penalized the NFL they've been hurt today Falk Marshall Faulk in the Seattle territory inside the 48 yard line I tied chi ko Kieffer has played one heck of a football game for the Seattle Seahawks at the defensive end position he's put a lot of pressure on Bulger he's run down runners that was a nice tackle by Marshall Faulk thus they're blitzing up the middle and if he doesn't make this play there he is up against the tie and outside Marshall Falks got a lot of green in front of him if he doesn't make that tackle second and six Valter under pressure to the sideline and outofbounds first down Isaac Bruce ha that's a way when you watch Bulger you know we've been talking all night about him going where everyone is on this football field and I can assure you that Isaac Bruce wasn't his number one target if he was anything he was third Isaac Bruce will go down look at this but you take a look at the time that that Bulger has he just finds Bruce because he was looking at Horry ho he also looked at Marshall Paul then he came back over here that looked like one of those moves that they make on that turf that into a quick stop turn around here I am the same kind of move he fell down on the first half Valter pumpfake goes deep roots on a bow and other flags on the play they'll call it again it's the pomp and go and the rules are set up for you to get called 19 tack 23 Dean fan by yard penalty nine out of ten times if a receiver runs a pump and go and you're going mantoman that's the situation Marcus Trufant there's a little out there's the oh wait guys I mean he doesn't put a hand on them that is a bad that's a bad call Oh tough to find any contact this is this is what scares me a little bit about the playoffs and this rule emphasis is are the officials going to be deciding factors in whether teams advance or not or is it going to be the play of the teams on the field that's the thing that scares me with this rule emphasis for flags for illegal contact on the secondary great cut marshal fought down to the 17 yard line and well there's still something left in the tank isn't living for this game well I'll tell you what he makes a move back to the inside and that is okie for going down the field he is being blocked but he never sees that move that Marshall makes back to the outside and there wasn't a linebacker there 951 it for a long long time his 11th year out of San Diego State one of the best that ever played the game very patient drive for the Rams you don't say that very odd phones are under pressure he can run inside the 10 slides at the nine Michael that patience has been helped an awful lot by a couple of penalties by the Seahawks in very crucial and critical situations if you throw the ball as much as the Rams do if you're not getting called for holding penalties you're gonna get some breaks good decision nice job again the seahawks basically do a nice job of covering there you see Trufant staying away from him but he's in his hip pocket Bulger's forced to take off the run they marked the ball up to 10 or Bulger started his slide second and three Jaxson or very hesitant picked up maybe more they need to reach the sevenfour first in I'll tell you what you want to talk about a guy we talked to Mike Martz about him last night with a lot of guts is Tom Newton number 6111 this guy is he in the he just he just hurt right oh yeah he lives back in and out of the huddle but what's that boat well watch it because up the line screamin he's limping now when that ball is snapped he is popping sprained left they have had offensive linemen beaten to a pulp all year Valter knocked away almost intercepted intended for the tight end and bull we're almost Picton buttcheek gko Kieffer again is the one that gets in Bulger's face look at number 56 he's forcing him to make the throw and you see michael boulware come cuts right in front if mano mano you'll it doesn't really hit him from behind he probably would pick it off Wilkins will come on for a 27yard field goal try he's hit from 38 and we are tied in Seattle with 807 to go in the first playoff game of the year what a great ballgame 807 to go in the playoffs from seattle st. Louis and the Seahawks deadlocked at 23 Michael we're midway through the fourth quarter both of these teams have only had two drives this head st. Louis 23 plays and two drives Seattle 21 plays in two drives that's ball controlling for st. Louis is amazing Morris from the war swallowed up at the 20 the RAM specialteams maligned all year done a pretty good job today ABC's coverage of the NFL playoffs brought to you by the coldest tasting beer in the world Coors Light the official beer sponsor at the NFL state farm like a good neighbor State Farm is there Wendy's Duke combo choices wendy's it's better here and Verizon Wireless we never stop working for you today's aerial coverage provided by anheuserbusch over the beautiful Qwest Field in Seattle kourin Robinson is on the field for the Seahawks and remember he's fumbled twice today fortunately one went out of bound the other he managed to recover Hasselbeck has had good protection now on a close that to me the side of the 44 when he do your gameplay this is this Hasselbeck it's it and his best but nearly at the if you watch what he catches this ball look at Hasselbeck god knows where he has to watch melee at the end of this play you talk about extra yards these are his Hasselbeck really tearing it up in the second half he is only missed to past Robbi Toback the starting center miked up for seattle trying to fire up this office up there man let's get some seven yeah let's go win this thing now hey let's go win this thing don't nothing else mattered let's go win this thing is zero zero baby let's do it Robbie Toback was in junior high school the last time this team won a playoff game well he's right about the zero zero but there happen to be twenty at two in front of both of them absol back good time underneath can't get much out of this because it Tommy Polly looks go to Susie well you're watching Robbie tobik that offensive line they are an exclusive group and since Matt arrived in Seattle he has worked really hard to be accepted by that group telling us that probably has something to do with watching Brett Favre and Green Bay he and his senator Frank winners were inseparable Matt naturally drawn to these guys and they've accepted it was one because he gets into fenders faces who plays hurt toughness they love that total control in the office so that really loves the guy all right Susie third and seven here huge play as we approach the sixminute mark Hasselbeck trying to change the blood Rancho Blitzen come with me Nestle back throws knocked away Jeremy Chris Butler was right there with Jackson and that was not a typical Matt Hasselbeck throw that one he had to wait a little bit more it was out of rhythm and he hung it up a little bit behind Jackson that's why he's upset with himself we've seen how hot he is in the second half over the last four games of the season he's completed almost 72 percent of his passes that was tipped a little bit to 410 touchdowns and four interceptions but that one wasn't quite the way he wanted Walter the kick to Sean McDonald he has to go all the way back to his pen returnable kik the 14 as the same and definitely to the 22 before he is drilled Marc Bulger got off to such a hot start can he get it back and bring the Rams of playoff victory Al Michaels and John Madden is standing by the second half our wildcard Saturday doubleheader from San Diego will have the NFL's top rusher Curtis Martin and the Jets against Drew Brees in the AFC West champion Chargers next here on ABC well you want to talk about some running backs in that game Wow mark vulture triangle his offense Chad brown doing Paul should got off to such a great only six out of ten cents Marshall fought the runningback lowers his shoulder running hard out to the 29 this is going to be this section of the game right now we will see the management skills of Mike marks how quickly does he want to move the ball down the field there's five minutes 20 seconds left he has no timeouts so he's going to force the at'll to use his if he can eat up some club and get him position remember they only need a field goal to a few of attempt to win this ball game forth again and Seattle swarms on Marvel fog they need to reach the 34 for a first down it will be a big third and short coming well you've got Tom Newton who's down now and and you know this guy it's been a warrior oh right Paulie fan I'd say I've been watching him all night long limp in and out of the huddle they have no idea how he's playing Mike Martz even told us last night he said we have no idea how this guy plays but he's wearing wearing a brace on that knee 1a1 ligament is is totally gone the other one is is spraying and Mike Martz said we are we're only going into this game was six and a half linemen to start with Newton being the half because he's limping on one leg they've had injury problems up front all year long starting with Kyle Turley at the beginning of the season well he has to go off because they technique there's a timeout here but I'm gonna say something to me this is when the st. Louis Rams are the most dangerous you've got them in a third and two and a half two situation and with all of their weapons and the things they do to me that's scary yeah but I still think that the first concern of Mike Martz has got to be to pick up the first down don't worry now they could throw a 15yard in that's his idea of picking up three yards I'm saying what you really have to get the yardage while we have a moment we'd like to thank our entire Sunday Night Football production team bringing you today's telecast led by our producer J Ross Bernard fifteen our technical director Mark Kirk Watson thanks for executive Brewster Jett Drake also here with us in Seattle today the senior vice president of ESPN's programming and mark Quinzel the executive producer of ABC sports is Mike her all the people who have worked with us all year our deepest appreciation weren't Fredersen a statistician Dave Alex turn from Elias ports and Nancy Volker a stage manager Annabel we've had you back huge play third and two for the Rams folds her out the flat first down and more McDonald holy cow what apply and you know down out of bounds that should have been another 15yard I mean as far as the game goes from an officiating standpoint they're letting these guys play with the emotions in this game how about that for a play called McDonald had not made a catch the entire game this is 31 yard yeah but I tell you what look at McDonald comes out of the backfield I said on third and 2 this is when they're the most dangerous because you have you play know you plan on him running the ball get the first down but they can look in here now you're throwing them out of bounds and I agree how is that not 15 yards ball Ken Hamlin does it I don't know why the officials are standing right there it should have been to hugely nonetheless for the Rams they have it at the 37 first and 10 Valter under me take him down at the 24 now here's the thing if you're the Seattle Seahawks you have your timeouts so you have the full complement of the three timeouts you also have the twominute warning in your favor right now you can still play some defense I don't think you start to use them but once this thing gets down to 3:30 Mike Holmgren got to start thinking about how he wants to use the timeouts Curtis has gone over the hundred yard mark with his fourth catch it's just amazing to watch these guys play every time you think you got where you wanna come oh hey I got you where they want you and the Seahawks have led a couple games get away from him in the fourth quarter he's building the first game they played against this team fall near the 20 and a clock continues to churn see this is a great call this is a great call because it puts him in second down and six but the best part about this call is it's going to run a lot of clock off and what they're trying to when March is trying to do is like Joe was talking about him willing to go let's force them Kobrin and the seattle seahawks can take a timeout which he hasn't done yet but he will inside when they get inside three minutes well after this play i think he's going to be forced to use one of his time if you don't want to burn them too early either again we don't want to give up the touchdown a few go give got a better chance to have an opportunity to tie there's a lot of things you don't want to do right now fall dancing ducks between tacklers reaches the 17 yard line they have to get to the 14 for a first down so there will be another big third down coming I don't write with this I think I should take a timeout here I find it interesting that they're letting the clock run down well they got a run a play before the two minutes that's met that's probably what he was thinking about and then they'll down take maybe take a timeout right after that to get to the twominute this will have to they think it better figure out how to stop them from picking up this first down first the Rams 13 on third down today playaction Bulger over the middle touchdown the tight end camp Cleveland are you kidding what I what a way to have your first catch he's only caught seven balls all during the regular season you see the look on Mike Marx's face you know he called the play he just said hey hey I called this play nobody's paying attention to camp Clayton Cleveland look at him go down in the middle of the field I mean you don't expect him to throw there and they do to me that is such a gutsy call again just situate it's against a rookie middle linebacker Quetta biddies he gets turned around and Mike Martz absolutely loves what he saw and Marc Bulger actually showed some emotion so many weapons and 27 points now for the st. Louis Rams who have taken the lead in NFL history eight teams have made the playoffs without a winning record and the st. Louis Rams are one of them none has ever won a postseason game but this is not your typical 8 and 18 Bulger literally missed three games of the bad shoulder they lost two of those that he didn't start they can conceivably be ten and six coming in now you spin it forward and you look at the Seattle Seahawks on offense you say okay what are they going to have to do against this Ram defense I think first of all they're going to have to catch the football you can't drop it you've got you're going to have the twominute warning plus you're gonna have the three timeouts so time is not necessarily going to be factor its they're gonna need bigger chunks than 6yard stuff you know what the factor is you see that seven up there yeah about that zero they got to go get it that's what that's what the factor is go get it to ot the Rams today have scored on drive 75 yards 75 yards and 76 yards now keep in mind the Seattle defense had allowed only one drive all year in 16 games for 80 yards or more for a touchdown can they end the drought the longest in the NFL it's been since 1984 Seattle was in an overtime situation against Green Bay last year can they get it there this year Morris and Evans are deep very short kick Morrison the going up the middle the best return today up to the 36 yard line and Morris is hurt Eric flowers was in on the special teams tackle and Morris doubled over as he comes off the field the pressure falls squarely on Matt Hasselbeck Sean Alexander and the offense of the Seattle Seahawks Mike Holmgren who won the division at nine and seven now here's a situation you got Sean Alexander who's got a sore wrist we just saw maurice morris go off the field down on the bench and they're working on him so both of your running backs are not in the best of shape fourman rush hassle back over the middle he has really worked as tight ends very effectively in duel of melee with another catch he's already down to the ranch 46 we've got a timeout to twominute warning at 159 the game is on the line for the Seahawks they are down twenty seven twenty with 159 to go how many times have you ever heard this the game is on the line and Jerry Rice is not on the field not very often in 20 years they got speed out there now first and ten from the 46 corn Robinson's got to step up for the Seahawks in this situation offensive line has done a good job Jackson to his hands again that's the way he started the game and that baby just whistled through there well this is a situation where you're running before you get the football and this is what joe said before when they took the ball the first thing he said is that the receivers have to hold on to the football I don't care if it's a three yard game and you might be have a chance to break it you've got to catch the football there's the drop pause the first one was intercepted that Darryl Jackson dropped we've seen others go on the ground but what a time to drop one you're definitely in for down territory but still Hasselbeck underneath to Jackson he didn't drop this one to the 25 ha Mike Holmgren here's a guy that's put two balls on the ground critical drops and yet he just keeps calling his number I mean that's a heck of a call by the coach well look what happens here they they get him outside Aaron Archuleta was inside and then he dropped back to the outside they even had a linebacker there and they couldn't stop the play 12 catches 128 yards for Jackson Castle Beckett under pressure a tool Amelie again it's the tool Amelie Darrell Jackson show you know guys I still think you have if you're Mike Holman you have to be conscious of the amount of time left in this game yeah I don't think you can score and leave the Rams with a minute I really think you've got to take this thing down as far as you can you've got plenty of time outs and pick your spots but don't leave a lot of time on that clock for that ramp offense six catches 98 for tool Amelie I disagree I think we got to put that ball in the end zone when you can and if it's right now do it pass so back is those down at the 18 yard line finally to pressure Jimmy Kennedy the secondyear defensive tackle at a Penn State gets the sack don't believe that a coach is going to say okay we got to run 25 seconds off and then score you score whatever you can because here are the bad things that can happen well when I talked to Gil Haskell their offensive coordinator one of their concerns regarding the Rams was their front for Jimmy Kennedy drafted a no three firstround pick Ryan Pickett drafted a no one firstround pick you've got Robert Thomas their middle linebacker drafted a no two firstround pick Damian Lewis the other tackle firstround pick a no one defensive line they got a bunch of number ones that can bring it if you get stuck that way but that offensive line has done a tremendous job today Leonard a little with all that speed from the outside hasn't but hasn't gotten a sniff and the quarterbacks have done an unbelievable job look at the playoff record for Hasselbeck sweet I'm sure most important 17yard still in front of them but I'll tell you something it every time that Sean Alexander has kind of drifted out in the backfield they really haven't had anybody on him Hasselbeck dose for the end zone very fortunate that Jackson was able to get back there and make sure that Travis Fisher didn't get a shot at that one try a little pump and go and you know it's third down you know you have to try and get it down to the one foot line if you want to get a first down well Travis Fisher wasn't buying boys over here looking for a first down on the one foot line I've been looking at they could come out a touchdown that'd be nice boy he really doesn't want to score beyond the scoring they've got to get in the end zone now third down fourman rush no pressure underneath Ingrid taken down at the five it will be fourth down and four it it will be over time possibly or else it'll be the Seahawks suffering another defeat but what a job this offensive line did Paul you talked about it well you know and let's look at this they're waiting on Bobby Engram to come underneath and look what the Rams in I like what they did defensively they played everybody back on the goal line to come up when the catch is made how about this throw that little flick the sidearm throw that hassle back puts out this said this is where you go to the coach and giving your best play and actually they were very fortunate that the umpire Karl paganella still has and quicks and ducked because that ball could have easily hit him and been an incompletion yeah he brings that thing down from the side to make the throw now Mike Homans got to have the play every coach has got the play this is it the guys have to block it up up front Mike Holmgren saying okay our defense has got to come up with a play Leonard little has not been heard of conceivably you could get a first down but it would be right at the goal line Hasselbeck wonder now in close intended for angler boy will there be a lot of second guessers on this baby because when you take a look at it did he have a chance to make it if he ran I thought he did Paul yeah I'm gonna tell you what I think large yeah those white shirts closed in a hurry now Bobby Engram number 84 is the guy that he was looking at here's the throw sidearm throw to Bobby Engram this ball hits him in the hands and he drops the football that is a hard catch anyway but the question is that Hasselbeck have in any room look at this I think that Paul that ball to me you know you're a receiver in the National Football League there's to me if it's if it's this kind of a situation in a game it touches your hands you've got to get out of catching and that is just heartbreak for Matt Hasselbeck and Mike Holmes were not to mention Bobby Engram Mike Holmgren is as respected well liked a coach as there is on the planet and if anybody up here is thinking Mike Holmgren should not be back as the coach of this franchise I think they're not this is a very young football team a Pro Bowl quarterback a Pro Bowl running back a very young defensive secondary Mike Holman has just started to build this football team they will be back in a playoffs a year from now again a crushing loss for Seattle the Rams beat the Seahawks 2720 will be back from Seattle after this from our ABC station 27:20 the final st. Louis over Seattle we asked could Matt Hasselbeck make it in Joe goody I don't think so Mike I think Matt Hasselbeck does a nice job of getting around trying to get the ball about it it would have been a tough catch just a bad situation let's go to Susie with Marc Bulger well mark that was close but so much for eight and eight what does it say about this team we know we're a good team we have talent but we've made a lot of mistakes this year and I see Idol played is good but unfortunately we've been making plays the last three weeks when we've had two and you know that wasn't the case all year congratulations thank you thank you Susie the final 27 24 Joe Theismann Paul McGuire Suzy Kolber and our entire ABC crew this is Mike Patrick what a ballgame now let's go to Chris Berman in New York all right Michael thank you very much well comes down to the last couple of plays the Rams made him the Seahawks did night of the Rams at first eight and eight team moving on in the playoffs Deb young Michael Strahan Brian Billick well Bolger including the winning touchdown on third down 9 of 14 very clutch berry and the running games were nonexistent for both teams it was a game of quarterbacks and so the end of the day one quarterback made they both played well one quarterback made one extra play than the other one didn't Marc Bulger gets the credit I agree with you I think the quarter game of the quarterback but the receivers you have to catch the ball I know the last season that last one was tough but the receivers hands of porous it's like me trying to hold a mouth full of water with my mouth open it just ain't gonna happen both teams played playoff caliber football they both responded to adversity neither team folded both can be very proud of what it done now turnovers a minimum which we spin the Rams bugaboo congratulations the Rams eight and eight are moving on we'll be back with the wild cherry Pepsi between game show
