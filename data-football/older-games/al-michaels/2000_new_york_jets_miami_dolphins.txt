============================================================

&gt;&gt; IT IS A BEAUTIFUL OCTOBER NIGHT IN THE BIG APPLE. WE'RE ABOUT EIGHT MILES AS THE BLIMP FLIES FROM MIDTOWN MANHATTAN. GIANTS STADIUM, EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY. AND OUT ONTO THE FIELD COME THE NEW YORK JETS TO TAKE ON THE MIAMI DOLPHINS. BATTLE FOR THE TOP SPOT IN THE AFC EAST. THE BALL IS BLOWN OFF THE TEE ON A BREEZY NIGHT. THE TEMPERATURE AROUND 50 DEGREES. JOHN HALL TO KICK OFF FOR THE JETS. DAVE WANNSTEDT, WHO COACHED THE CHICAGO BEARS FOR SIX YEARS. HE WAS THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR UNDER JIMMY JOHNSON BACK IN THE EARLY '90s. AND AL GROH, WHOSE ONLY PRIOR HEAD COACHING EXPERIENCE BEFORE THIS SEASON WAS AT WAKE FOREST, IN THE ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE AT THAT POINT, IN THE EARLY '80s. &gt;&gt; JOHN HALL'S RATE OF TOUCHBACKS HAS DIMINISHED EACH YEAR, AL, AS HIS FIELDGOAL PERCENTAGE GETS HIGHER. SORT OF LIKE TIGER WOODS HE DIALED HIS STROKE IN. &gt;&gt; THIS KICK IS A PRETTY GOOD ONE. IT'S FIELDED BY BROCK MARION AT THE 7YARD LINE. HE BRINGS IT OUT PAST THE 20. AND THE MIAMI RETURN MAN BRINGS IT TO THE 29. AND MELISSA TALKING ABOUT TONY MARTIN INJURED, NOT PLAYING. O.J. McDUFFIE, THOUGH, IN UNIFORM AND FIGURES TO PLAY IN MOST THIRDDOWN SITUATIONS. &gt;&gt; BRYAN COX SAID KONRAD CAN'T BLOCK HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG. I'D SEND KONRAD RIGHT AFTER HIM. &gt;&gt; FIEDLER TO THROW ON FIRST DOWN. AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT BY LESLIE SHEPHERD. GAIN OF ABOUT 5. LAMAR SMITH ON SECOND DOWN. COMING UP ABOUT A YARD AND A HALF SHY OF THE FIRST. SHANE BURTON MAKES THE HIT. BRYAN COX, ONETIME DOLPHIN, AND HE PLAYED WITH THE BEARS WHEN WANNSTEDT WAS THE COACH THERE. FIEDLER ON THIRD AND 1 GIVES THE BALL TO SMITH. AND SMITH ACROSS THE 38YARD LINE AND HAS THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AL, HE MIGHT HAVE PLAYED FOR WANNSTEDT WHEN HE WAS THERE, BUT I WONDER IF EITHER OF THESE GUYS TRACE ARMSTRONG OR COX PLAYED FOR WANNSTEDT THERE, BECAUSE WANNSTEDT SEEMS LIKE A MAN REBORN, DOESN'T HE? &gt;&gt; HE DOES. &gt;&gt; HE LEARNED THE HARD WAY IN CHICAGO. THIS IS ANOTHER THIRDDOWN CONVERSION FOR THE DOLPHINS. THEY'VE BEEN VERY GOOD THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY GET A LOT OF SHORT SITUATIONS ON THIRD DOWN WITH THIS TYPE OF OFFENSE. THEY RUN THE BALL MORE THAN ANY TEAM IN THE LEAGUE. AND THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS BECAUSE OF LAMAR SMITH. HE'S A PATIENT, HARDNOSED RUNNER. THURMAN THOMAS GIVES THEM THE VERSATILITY IN ALL SITUATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN NICKEL. AND, OF COURSE, J.J. JOHNSON WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT THING ON BRYAN COX, DAN? WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY DO? IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S PERMANENTLY ON A RIDE AT DISNEYLAND. WHAT IS THAT? &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S A NECK BRACE. AND WHEN YOU HIT AS MUCH AS COX DOES AND HE LEADS WITH HIS HELMET YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE BACK IT KEEPS HIS HEAD FROM SNAPPING BACK. &gt;&gt; REALLY? IT'S THAT FIRM, THAT THING? &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. IT'S LIKE FIRSTCLASS ON YOUR PRIVATE JET. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; NOT TONIGHT. FIRST DOWN AT THE 38YARD LINE BY HALF THE LENGTH OF THE FOOTBALL. SO THE DOLPHINS AT THE NEW YORK 38YARD LINE. AND THE DOLPHINS, AS YOU CAN SEE 5644 THE RUN/PASS RATIO. AND OF ALL THINGS, IN THE POSTMARINO ERA, THE MOST RUNDOMINANT TEAM IN THE LEAGUE. AND AGAIN A RUN HERE BY SMITH AND A FIRST DOWN! SO LAMAR SMITH, IN A WAY A BIT OF A RECLAMATION PROJECT. A SOMETIME STARTER WITH THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS. WENT TO NEW ORLEANS. GOT LOST IN THE SHUFFLE THERE WHEN THEY DRAFTED RICKY WILLIAMS. AND THEN PICKED UP BY MIAMI. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT LAMAR SMITH HAS BROUGHT TO THE DOLPHINS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE FIRST TACKLER MISS, AS HE DOES KEVIN WILLIAMS RIGHT THERE. GETS ABOUT 3 EXTRA YARDS. WE'LL SEE SMITH CARRY THE BALL TONIGHT 25, MAYBE EVEN 30 TIMES. &gt;&gt; SMITH IN HIS SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, AND YET THIS IS HIS FIRST MONDAYNIGHT APPEARANCE. ACROSS THE 50, TO THE 49. HE COMES OUT. THURMAN THOMAS, THE FUTURE HALL OF FAMER, IS IN THE GAME. AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT BY HUNTER GOODWIN, THE TIGHT END. TO THE 41YARD LINE. THAT'S A GAIN OF 8. &gt;&gt; COMING BACK AFTER THAT PITTSBURGH LOSS, THEY NEEDED TO BE TOUGH, AND GROH GOT WHAT HE WANTED. &gt;&gt; LAMAR SMITH BACK IN THE GAME. AND LAMAR, ON SECOND AND 2, GETS TO THE 39, AND THAT'S CLOSE TO A FIRST DOWN. AL GROH, THE LINEBACKERS COACH HERE LAST YEAR. AND, OF COURSE, HAD BELICHICK REMAINED HERE, GROH PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BILL'S DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO LOVE THE LOOK ON GROH, WITH THE GRAY SWEATSHIRT. HE'S LIKE TYSON COMING INTO THE RING WITH THAT TOWEL TORN OUT, MAN. THERE'S NO FRILLS WITH GROH. HE'S GOT A SIGN ON HIS DESK. IT SAYS, "JUST COACH THE TEAM." YOU TALK ABOUT A BASIC APPROACH. &gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM WHAT HIS APPROACH FOR HIS DEFENSE WAS GONNA BE THIS WEEK, AND HE SAID HE TOLD THEM TO ALL WEAR A LOT OF PADS. IT'S GONNA BE A VERY PHYSICAL GAME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S PROBABLY YEAH, THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL. AS ROB KONRAD PICKS UP 3. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THE ANNOTATED MICHAELS PRETTY SOON. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE WHAT "ANNOTATED" OR "PERIPATETIC" MEANS. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] OR "PERIPATETIC" MEANS. &gt;&gt; BUT I DO KNOW THAT &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] JAY FIEDLER, HE SAID THEY'VE GOT &gt;&gt; BUT I DO KNOW THAT TO RUN THE BALL WELL ON FIRST JAY FIEDLER, HE SAID THEY'VE GOT DOWN, AND THEY'RE GONNA BE GOING TO RUN THE BALL WELL ON FIRST AGAINST A LINEBACKER THAT HAD A DOWN, AND THEY'RE GONNA BE GOING FANTASTIC GAME LAST WEEK. AGAINST A LINEBACKER THAT HAD A HERE'S MO LEWIS, NUMBER 57. FANTASTIC GAME LAST WEEK. HE EVEN GOT IN ON THE OFFENSIVE HERE'S MO LEWIS, NUMBER 57. PLAYS. HE EVEN GOT IN ON THE OFFENSIVE DOES A NICE JOB OF FIGHTING OFF PLAYS. HUNTER GOODWIN. HEY, HOW ABOUT HUNTER GOODWIN CATCHING A PASS ON THIS FIRST DRIVE? &gt;&gt; TIGHT END WITH AN 8YARD GAIN ON THE PASS THAT HE CAUGHT. JETS SHOWING BLITZ. ON SECOND AND 7, THEY GIVE IT TO SMITH. AND HE GETS WRAPPED UP AS HE CROSSES THE 35YARD LINE. AND LEADING THE CHARGE IS MARVIN JONES. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE FIEDLER SAID THEY GET IN THIRDDOWN SITUATIONS, THEY EXPECT A LOT OF BLITZES, AND HE'S GOT TO GET RID OF THE BALL IN A HURRY BECAUSE THE DOLPHIN RECEIVERS ARE RECEIVERS THAT ARE NOT GONNA MAKE A LOT OF YARDS AFTER THE CATCH. HERE'S THE HIT MAN, MARVIN JONES, IN THE MIDDLE, 55. AND LEADS THE JETS IN TACKLES BECAUSE OF THAT TYPE OF ABILITY RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; WELL, MARVIN'S TIME WAS GETTING VERY SITUATIONAL THERE FOR A WHILE, AND HE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT. THEY GAVE HIM MORE PLAYS LAST WEEK, KEPT HIM IN ON THIRD DOWNS, AND HE HAD A HECK OF A GAME. HE JUST IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS WHO NEEDS THE WORK. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 5, AND O.J. McDUFFIE SEES HIS FIRST ACTION OF THE SEASON. HE'S THE MAN IN MOTION, 81. FIEDLER LOOKS THE OTHER WAY. AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT AT THE 28YARD LINE BY ORONDE GADSDEN. FORWARD PROGRESS GIVES HIM A FIRST DOWN. TACKLED BY MO LEWIS. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHAT FIEDLER WAS TALKING ABOUT, IS THAT THE RECEIVERS HAVE GOT TO GO DOWN THE FIELD AND GET THE YARDAGE NECESSARY AND THEY CAN'T REALLY RELY ON THEIR RUNNING ABILITY AFTERWARDS. BUT THE PROTECTION IS THERE. THE OFFENSIVE LINE FOR THE DOLPHINS ONLY HAS ALLOWED 10 SACKS THIS YEAR ON MIAMI QUARTERBACKS. YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE A GOOD, SHARP ROUTE IN FRONT OF MARCUS COLEMAN FOR ORONDE GADSDEN. &gt;&gt; THEY LOST LAMAR THOMAS, ANOTHER RECEIVER, IN PRESEASON. AS FIEDLER RETREATS. FIEDLER GOES DEEP. AND THAT IS GADSDEN GETTING FREE AT THE 1YARD LINE! KEVIN WILLIAMS IS THE GUY WHO GETS BEATEN ON THE PLAY. 26 YARDS, AND IT'S FIRST AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; AND DAN MARINO NEVER THREW A BETTER PASS THAN THIS ONE TO ORONDE GADSDEN. IT'S A DEEP CORNER ROUTE AGAINST TWODEEP. THIS BALL IS PERFECTLY THROWN IN FRONT OF KEVIN WILLIAMS AND OVER THE HEAD OF MARCUS COLEMAN. WHAT A GREAT PASS BY FIEDLER, WHO IS OFF TO A GREAT START HERE IN HIS HOMETOWN 4 FOR 4 NOW AND ON THE VERGE OF PUTTING ONE IN THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1YARD LINE. THEY GIVE IT TO SMITH, AND HE CAN'T GET IN. IT IS MARVIN JONES WHO DENIES HIM. &gt;&gt; I WAS ASKING MO LEWIS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES OF THE LINEBACKERS. HE SAID THAT BRYAN COX IS MISUNDERSTOOD BUT A NICE GUY AND ROMAN PHIFER IS ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT. AND ABOUT MARVIN JONES, HE SAYS, "HE JUST LIKES TO HIT." WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF HUGE HITS ALREADY FROM NUMBER 55. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM THE 1YARD LINE. KONRAD IS IN MOTION. FIEDLER'S GOING TO THROW. AND HE THROWS IT OUT OF THE BACK OF THE END ZONE. AND THAT'S HIS FIRST INCOMPLETE PASS. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS REALLY WELL DEFENSED BY THE JETS, BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL LINEBACKERS IN THE GAME. YOU CAN SEE MO LEWIS IS BACK THERE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY RUN THEIR THIRD PLAY FROM THE 1. ON THIRD AND GOAL THERE'S A WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP. FLAG DOWN. WALT COLEMAN IS THE REFEREE. WHO MOVED? WHO MOVED FIRST? &gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE SNAP, FALSE START, 60, OFFENSE. 5 YARDS. STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; JOHN BOCK. SO APPARENTLY, DAN, THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE 1, HAVING NOT RUN A SINGLE PLAY FROM THE 1YARD STRIPE THIS SEASON. &gt;&gt; AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 6YARD LINE. JOHN BOCK, WHO WAS GONNA GET OUT IN FRONT THERE ON THE PULL, JUST MOVED TOO SOON. THERE HE IS. YOU CAN JUST SEE HIS HEAD THERE NUMBER 60. HE'S FILLING IN FOR MARK DIXON, WHO'S OUT WITH A BAD ELBOW. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND GOAL NOW FROM THE 6. OPENING DRIVE OF THE GAME. THE DOLPHINS HAVE HAD THE BALL FOR ALMOST 7 MINUTES. &gt;&gt; THEY MIGHT FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AT THE 6 THAN THEY DID AT THE 1. &gt;&gt; WE'LL FIND OUT. FIEDLER. HE SWINGS IT OUT TO SMITH. AND THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE FROM THE 6 EITHER. MARVIN JONES WITH THE TACKLE. BIG DEFENSIVE SERIES FROM MARVIN JONES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A HUGE DEFENSIVE STAND. I MEAN, THE DOLPHINS WERE ON THE 1YARD LINE. FIRST AND GOAL FROM THE 1 AND THEY END UP LOSING 8 YARDS, ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 9YARD LINE. WATCH MARVIN JONES, 55, COME OUT HERE ON LAMAR SMITH. LEWIS WITH THE BLITZ. AND WHEN THE BALL IS CAUGHT, SMITH HAS NO PLACE TO GO. &gt;&gt; FIEDLER SHOWED A LOT OF TOUCH ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PASSES ON THAT FIRST SERIES, DAN. HE LOOKED GOOD, HUH? &gt;&gt; YEAH, HE DID. &gt;&gt; 28YARD ATTEMPT FOR OLINDO MARE, A VERY ACCURATE FIELDGOAL KICKER. AND HE BOOTS IT THROUGH. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO BACK TO THIS CATCH BY ORONDE GADSDEN. WAS HE IN BOUNDS OR NOT? ONE FOOT DOWN, ONE FOOT OUT OF BOUNDS. AND THE JETS WERE TRYING TO CHALLENGE THIS CALL, AND THE OFFICIALS DIDN'T SEE IT. &gt;&gt; EITHER THEY DIDN'T SEE IT OR THEY DIDN'T CHALLENGE IT IN TIME. WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON A PLAY LIKE THAT OFTTIMES IS THEY'LL LOOK AT OUR REPLAY UPSTAIRS AS MARE KICKS OFF AND IT'S FIELDED BY STONE. AND HE TAKES IT BACK TO THE 25 AND THEN OUT TO THE 29YARD LINE. BUT THE GUY WILL LOOK UPSTAIRS AND THEN CALL DOWN, AND THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TOO LATE IN ATTEMPTING TO CHALLENGE. &gt;&gt; WANNSTEDT ALSO TOLD US IN OUR MEETING THEY HAVE A REDALERT PLAY. WHEN THEY THINK SOMETHING MIGHT BE REPLAYED, THEY HUSTLE THEIR BUNS DOWN THERE AND GET THE NEXT PLAY OFF BEFORE THE TEAM CAN ASK FOR THE REPLAY. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT DOWN FAIRLY QUICKLY. IT'S FIRST DOWN FROM THE 30YARD LINE. AND THAT'S CURTIS MARTIN SHOVING HIS WAY FOR A HALFYARD. SECOND DOWN AND 10. VINNY. AND HE JUST STEPS OUT OF BOUNDS. EVERYBODY WAS COVERED AT THE 29YARD LINE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A VERY GOOD DOLPHIN DEFENSIVE FRONT SEVEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE GOT A FRONT SEVEN JUST ON THE DEFENSIVE LINE. THEY ROTATE SO MANY GUYS IN AND OUT OF THERE, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO INCLUDE THE LINEBACKERS. YOU'VE GOT SEVEN GUYS WHO PLAY A LOT OF TIME ON THE DLINE FOR THE DOLPHINS. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 11. AND THAT IS KNOCKED DOWN BY BROCK MARION. INTENDED FOR DEDRIC WARD. I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AKRON IS INFAMOUS FOR. &gt;&gt; THE ZIPS. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY TEAM KNOWN AS THE ZIPS. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T GERRY FAUST SETTLE OUT THERE EVENTUALLY? &gt;&gt; "INFAMOUS" IS NOT A POSITIVE DESCRIPTION. &gt;&gt; NEITHER IS "ZIPS" AS A NICKNAME, I DON'T THINK. AND THIS IS COMING FROM A GUY WHO PLAYED AT A SCHOOL CALLED THE DUCKS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; I GUESS THE ZIPS WERE JUST SHUT OUT SO MANY TIMES. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] BACK TO PUNT IS TOM TUPA. AND LESLIE SHEPHERD AND JEFF OGDEN ARE BACK TWO GUYS BACK FOR MIAMI. IT'S A HIGH, FLOATING KICK. AND A FAIR CATCH IS CALLED FOR BY SHEPHERD AT THE 31. SO THE DOLPHINS WILL TAKE OVER FOR THE SECOND TIME THERE WITH 5:54 TO GO. FIRST DOWN AT THE 31YARD LINE. FIEDLER THROWS. AND THE CATCH IS MADE BY ORONDE GADSDEN! A LITTLE HURDLE ACTION TO THE 43YARD LINE. JAMES FARRIOR IS THE GUY HE LEAPED OVER, AND A DECATHLETE LIKE FIEDLER CAN APPRECIATE THAT MOVE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, HE'S GONNA APPRECIATE THE PLAY CALLING, TOO. CHAN GAILEY THROWING THE BALL ON FIRST DOWN NOW. THIS IS A GREAT MOVE RIGHT HERE. HE GOES RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF FARRIOR. AGAINST MARCUS COLEMAN, WHO'S PLAYING HIM SOFT AND TO THE OUTSIDE. PERFECT PASS BY JAY FIEDLER. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW GAILEY LOVES THE FACT THAT HE HASN'T OPENED UP FIEDLER YET. WITH ALL THESE RUNS, 51. AND THEY STILL HAVE A PLACE TO GO WITH FIEDLER. THE GUY CAN THROW. THEY CAN OPEN HIM UP NOW MIDWAY THROUGH THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; CHAN GAILEY, THE LAST TWO YEARS THE COWBOYS' HEAD COACH, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR FOR MIAMI. SENDS IN THIS PLAY. WIDE OPEN IS LESLIE SHEPHERD! TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; LESLIE SHEPHERD, WHO'S BEEN AROUND, AND HE'S BEEN A BIGPLAY GUY THROUGH THE YEARS. AND A BIG PLAY RIGHT HERE 42 YARDS. &gt;&gt; AND HE SPLIT THE TWODEEP COVERAGE OF THE JETS WITH A BEAUTIFUL PASS. HE LOOKS OFF TO THE RIGHT. NOW HE'S GOT SHEPHERD RIGHT DOWN THE GUT. LOOK AT THE TIGHT SPIRAL. WHAT A GREAT PASS. FIEDLER NOW 7 OUT OF 8, 113 YARDS. AND THIS IS A GUY WHOSE BEST GAME IS 175 YARDS. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GLASS OFF FIEDLER'S LOCKER. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; MARE FOR THE POINT AFTER. AND SO SHEPHERD SCORED A TOUCHDOWN AGAINST BUFFALO IN THE DOLPHINS' LAST GAME. THEY HAD THE BYE WEEK. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE PASS PROTECTION THAT FIEDLER HAS ON THAT BALL. A CLEAR THROWING LANE TO HIS RECEIVER. AND THE JETS LOOK LIKE THEY'RE JUST A STEP SLOW ON DEFENSE TONIGHT. THE DOLPHINS, AS YOU SAID, AL, ARE SUPER SHARP. &gt;&gt; JUST A TINGE OF MARINO IN FIEDLER'S DELIVERY. QUICK OFF THE EAR LIKE THAT. NOT DANNY'S GUN, BUT QUICK RELEASE THERE. &gt;&gt; SIMILAR RESULTS. &gt;&gt; MARE'S KICK FIELDED BY KEVIN WILLIAMS. FROM THE 5, KEVIN WILLIAMS COMES BACK OUT TO THE 28YARD LINE. FROM THE 27YARD LINE, HERE'S MARTIN TAKING IT UP TO THE 30YARD LINE. HE'S TACKLED THERE BY JERMAINE HALEY. DAN, LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT CURTIS MARTIN. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE'S ALREADY RUSHED FOR OVER 1,000 YARDS IN EACH OF HIS FIVE SEASONS. HE'S ALREADY HALFWAY THERE TO ANOTHER 1,000 YARDS. HE'S MOST DANGEROUS ON DRAW PLAYS, WHERE HE SEES THE OPEN LANES. AND BEING A VERTICAL RUNNER, HIS MOVES ARE ALWAYS INTENDED TO GET YARDS GOING STRAIGHT AHEAD. THIS YEAR, HE'S SHOWING HIS VERSATILITY EVEN MORE FIVE TDs RUSHING, TWO TDs RECEIVING. AND WHAT JET FAN WILL EVER FORGET HIS TOUCHDOWN PASS TO BEAT THE BUCS? &gt;&gt; HUGE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND 7. THAT PASS WAS THROWN TO CHREBET. THAT PASS IS KNOCKED AWAY BY JERRY WILSON. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE THEY ANIMATED A PRETTY BIG PACKAGE IN THERE ON CURTIS, DIDN'T THEY? I MEANT THE ENTIRE PACKAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY. &gt;&gt; OH, YES. I KNOW. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CHUCKLE THAT MUCH, THOUGH, YOU KNOW? BUT I'M CHUCKLING. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, MARTIN IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL WORKHORSE. THIS GUY, IN AN 82GAME CAREER, HAS CARRIED THE BALL 30 OR MORE TIMES 15 TIMES. YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES JIMMY BROWN DID IT? JIMMY BROWN'S THOUGHT TO BE THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR. HE HAD SIX IN HIS CAREER! &gt;&gt; JERALD SOWELL IN THE GAME IN THE BACKFIELD NOW ON THIRD DOWN AND 7. NEW YORK SEEKING ITS FIRST FIRST DOWN. AND THAT PASS IS CAUGHT AT THE 36YARD LINE. BUT WHAT A GREAT TACKLE! DEDRIC WARD IS WRAPPED UP BY PATRICK SURTAIN TO KEEP HIM FROM PICKING UP THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT TIGHT BUMPANDRUN COVERAGE OF THE DOLPHINS JUST STUFFING THE RECEIVERS AFTER THE CATCH. SURTAIN IS NUMBER 23. AND IT LOOKS REAL GOOD FOR WARD ABOUT HERE. BUT LOOK HOW QUICKLY SURTAIN CLOSES AND GETS HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; EARLY IN THE SEASON, THEY WERE WONDERING IF EVERYTHING WAS GONNA FUNNEL OVER TO SURTAIN BECAUSE OF MADISON'S GROWING ACUMEN, BUT WANNSTEDT TOLD US SURTAIN'S MADE AS MANY BIG PLAYS AS MADISON. &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, THE DOLPHINS TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON AND OFF THE FIELD. AND IT LOOKED LIKE A FIRE DRILL. IT LOOKED LIKE HALF THE TEAM WAS ON THE FIELD TRYING TO GET OFF THE FIELD, AND THE WHISTLE SOUNDS, INDICATING TOO MANY GUYS ON THE FIELD FOR MIAMI. &gt;&gt; TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; OR TIMEOUT, MIAMI. &gt;&gt; MIAMI. &gt;&gt; HEADSUP PLAY BY THE DOLPHINS CALLING THIS TIMEOUT. TRACE ARMSTRONG, 93, AND RICH OWENS, 96, ARE GONNA BE RUNNING TO THE SIDELINES HERE. THEY GET OUT TO THE OUTSIDE. THERE'S SURTAIN WITH THE HANDS, CALLING TIMEOUT. THAT SAVED THEM THAT FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE PLAYS IN THE NBA WHEN SOMEBODY'S FALLING OUT OF BOUNDS AND THEY CALL TIMEOUT RIGHT BEFORE THEY HIT THE FLOOR. &gt;&gt; SURTAIN WITH TWO BIG PLAYS ON THAT SERIES THAT TACKLE AND THEN THE TIMEOUT TO SAVE WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN A FIRST DOWN. AS TUPA'S PUNT IS FIELDED BY LESLIE SHEPHERD, THE GUY WHO SCORED THE TOUCHDOWN FOR MIAMI. ZACH THOMAS, WHO HAS THAT ANKLE SPRAIN, WAS LIMITED IN PRACTICE THIS WEEK. GOT RETAPED. MEANWHILE, JAY FIEDLER AND THE OFFENSE TAKES OVER NOW AT THE 32. BEEN A FIRST QUARTER DOMINATED BY THE DOLPHINS. AND THEY BEGIN ON THE GROUND WITH SMITH CUTTING TO THE OUTSIDE. AND LAMAR SMITH HAS THE FIRST DOWN AND THEN FINALLY IS STILL ON HIS FEET! HE WASN'T DRAGGED DOWN BY FROST! HE'S GONNA GO ALL THE WAY! HE BROKE A TACKLE BY SCOTT FROST A WOULDBE TACKLE THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED A TOUCHDOWN. INSTEAD AL GROH IS STUNNED. THE CROWD IS STUNNED. HE JUST GOES 68 YARDS, AND THE DOLPHINS LEAD 160, GOING ON 17. &gt;&gt; THE BEAUTIFUL PART WAS HE WENT AIRBORNE, AND AS SOON AS HIS FEET HIT THE GROUND, THE ACCELERATION WAS INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING RUN BY LAMAR SMITH. RICHMOND WEBB SAID THAT THE OFFENSIVE LINE LOVES RUNNING FOR THIS GUY BECAUSE HE'S PATIENT. YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE THE GREATEST SPEED IN THE WORLD, BUT HE CERTAINLY DID ON THIS PLAY AS HE PULLS AWAY FROM SCOTT FROST AND THEN OUTRUNS THE SECONDARY. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, AL GROH IS SUCH A MINUTEDETAIL GUY. YOU GOT TO WONDER IF GOING TO MONDAY NIGHT HERE HAS THROWN THESE GUYS OFF THEIR SCHWERVE A LITTLE. &gt;&gt; MARE FOR THE POINT AFTER. WE HAVE PLAYED 11:51. MIAMI HAS 205 TOTAL YARDS. THE JETS HAVE 7. &gt;&gt; HERE'S MARVIN JONES RIGHT HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE THE DOLPHINS HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY OF CONTROLLING HIM. HE'S GONNA BE TAKEN OUT OF THIS PLAY AS SMITH SETS UP THE BLOCK PERFECTLY. GREAT PATIENCE THERE TO LET HIS LINEMEN WORK IN FRONT OF HIM. AND THEN HE PAYS IT OFF FOR HIMSELF AND THAT OFFENSIVE LINE BY TAKING IT IN. &gt;&gt; ROBBIE KONRAD LAID A NICE BLOCK ON THERE. HE'S GOT A VENDETTA GOING TONIGHT WHEN THEY QUESTION HIS MANHOOD LIKE THAT. I THOUGHT HE'D BE A PRETTY GOOD BET TO KNOCK SOME HEADS. &gt;&gt; HERE'S KEVIN WILLIAMS BRINGING IT BACK TO THE 31YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; DENNIS, YOU TALKED ABOUT WHEN LAMAR SMITH HIT THE GROUND AFTER LEAPING THROUGH. AND NOW HE USES HIS STRENGTH TO PULL AWAY FROM SCOTT FROST, WHO JUST GETS A BIT OF A LEFT SHOULDER NOT ENOUGH TO BRING DOWN A GUY THAT WEIGHS 230. THIS BLOCKING UP FRONT WAS JUST OUTSTANDING. &gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY, SCOTTY TACKLED LIKE AN OLD QUARTERBACK THERE, DIDN'T HE? &gt;&gt; YEAH, HE DID, UNFORTUNATELY. KEVIN DONNALLEY WITH A GREAT BLOCK ON THE CORNER THERE. BUT JUST SEE HOW HE STRUNG IT OUT TO THE SIDELINE, LET HIS LINE WORK, AND THEN CUT BACK. &gt;&gt; SO THE JETS, DOWN BY 17, 3 MINUTES TO GO IN THE FIRST. AND TESTAVERDE GOING TO THE AIR. A LITTLE DUMPOFF. AND NOBODY'S HOME. I THINK INTENDED FOR MARTIN, AND DOWN HE GOES IN THE ARMS OF TAYLOR. SECOND DOWN AND 10. TESTAVERDE GOING DEEP. AND IT IS OFF THE FINGERTIPS OF COLES, THE ROOKIE OUT OF FLORIDA STATE. LAVERANUES COLES. AND IT'S THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TESTAVERDE'S BEST PASS OF THE NIGHT. HE'S OFF TO A TERRIBLE START. &gt;&gt; MIGHT AS WELL RUN LAVERANUES COLES ON THE FLY PATTERN 4.19 40 TIME IN COLLEGE. THAT VIOLATES SOME LAW OF PHYSICS, I THINK. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 10. VINNY DUMPS IT OFF UNDERNEATH, BUT GOING NOWHERE IS MARTIN. HE'S TACKLED BY JEFFRIES. AND THE JETS STILL DO NOT HAVE A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THIS FRONT FOUR GIVES GREAT PRESSURE HERE, AND THAT ALLOWS THE REST OF THE DEFENSE TO SIT BACK AND TAKE AWAY TESTAVERDE'S FIRST LOOK. SO NOW HE'S SCRAMBLING AROUND. HE FINDS MARTIN. BUT THE SPEED OF JEFFRIES CLOSES AND MAKES THE TACKLE WAY SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; HEY, ARMSTRONG'S GOT 10 SACKS. I THINK JASON TAYLOR HAS SIX, 'CAUSE THEY GAVE HIM ONE ON THAT OUTOFBOUNDS PLAY. THESE GUYS ARE 265 AND 250, AND THEY COME REALLY HARD. &gt;&gt; HERE'S TUPA'S KICK. FIELDED BY LESLIE SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; OOH. &gt;&gt; AND SHEPHERD BRINGS IT BACK TO THE 35YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 35YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. AND THEY GIVE IT TO ROB KONRAD. YOU KNOW, COMING INTO THE GAME, MIAMI IN FIRST PLACE BECAUSE OF ITS DEFENSE PREDOMINANTLY. QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR OFFENSE. IN THE MEANTIME, THEY HAVE NOW RACKED UP MORE YARDAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAN ANY TEAM IN ANY FIRST QUARTER IN THE NFL THIS SEASON. &gt;&gt; INCLUDING THE RAMS? &gt;&gt; INCLUDING ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; MAN. &gt;&gt; 207 YARDS. AND CHAN GAILEY, FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THE HEAD COACH OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS, OF COURSE, COMING OVER, CALLING THE PLAYS. AND WITH THE RETIREMENT OF MARINO AND CHAN COMING IN AND FIEDLER AT QUARTERBACK, THEY'VE BECOME MORE RUNNINGORIENTED. BUT YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; CHAN KEEPS THIS UP, HE'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD FULL GLASSES. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 8. FIEDLER HAS THAT ONE TIPPED. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. TIPPED BY JAMES FARRIOR. &gt;&gt; LET'S GET A REPORT FROM MELISSA STARK. &gt;&gt; AL, EARLIER TODAY DAVE WANNSTEDT WAS OUT ON HIS MORNING JOG AND HE CAME OVER HERE TO GIANTS STADIUM AND CHECKED OUT THE FIELD AND CONFIRMED WHAT MANY OTHER TEAMS HAD ALREADY TOLD HIM IT'S VERY SOFT. SO HE WENT BACK, TOLD HIS PLAYERS HE WANTED THEM WEARING LONGER CLEATS TONIGHT. TYPICALLY THEY WEAR THESE HALFINCH CLEATS THAT ARE HERE ON THE RIGHT. THEY WEAR THESE HALFINCH CLEATS. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE. AND TONIGHT THEY'RE WEARING 5/8INCH CLEATS A LITTLE BIT LONGER. THE DIFFERENCE LOOKS INSIGNIFICANT, BUT THE DOLPHINS ARE HOPING IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IN THEIR TRACTION. &gt;&gt; SEE, HOW A HALFINCH IS 4/8, THEY'RE WEARING 5/8. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN EXTRA EIGHTH. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 8. [ WHISTLES BLOWING ] FIEDLER. AND A FLAG IS DOWN. A FLAG WAS THROWN BECAUSE WE HAVE A DELAY OF THE GAME IS THE REASON. SO THERE WAS NO PLAY TO BEGIN WITH. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE REF WAS GIVING ME TIME TO EXPLAIN THAT EIGHTHS THING. &gt;&gt; DELAY, OFFENSE. 5 YARDS. STILL THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHO THEIR SECONDLEADING RUSHER, BEHIND LAMAR SMITH, IS? IT'S THE QUARTERBACK, JAY FIEDLER. AND ALL 28 OF HIS RUNS SO FAR THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLE PLAYS. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, FIEDLER HAS 134 YARDS RUNNING THIS YEAR. MARINO HAD 87 IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER. &gt;&gt; AMAZING. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TRADE? &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 13. UNDER PRESSURE. AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. HE TRIED TO GET IT OUT TO THURMAN THOMAS. AND THE PRESSURE WAS PUT ON BY MO LEWIS. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN WE SAW AL GROH TALKING TO THE DEFENSE ON THE SIDELINES? THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE THE HEAD COACH COMING OVER AND GIVING HIS TWO CENTS' WORTH. WE SAW FARRIOR WITH THE PLAY ON THE PLAY PREVIOUS, KNOCKING A PASS DOWN. HERE'S MO LEWIS WITH THE PRESSURE. THURMAN THOMAS LETS HIM GO BECAUSE IT'S A SCREEN PASS. &gt;&gt; ONE THING THE JETS HAVE BEEN PROFICIENT AT THIS SEASON IS COMING FROM BEHIND. THEY DID IT AGAINST GREEN BAY. THEY DID AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. THEY DID IT ON THE ROAD AT TAMPA BAY, AND THEY'LL HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN TONIGHT, AS THE KICK IS FIELDED AT THE 34YARD LINE BY DEDRIC WARD. AS MATT TURK'S PUNT IS CRADLED THERE. TRICK PLAYS, OF COURSE, ARE IN THE PLAYBOOK OF BOTH OF THESE TEAMS. A FIRST DOWN ON A RUN. HE HAD A TREMENDOUS DAY, OF COURSE, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BALL. AND WE'LL PROBABLY SEE SOME OF THAT TONIGHT. BUT RIGHT NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO FIGHT THEIR WAY BACK INTO THE GAME, AS MARTIN IS TAKEN DOWN AFTER A GAIN OF 1 BY JERRY WILSON. &gt;&gt; WELL, RIGHT NOW A TRICK PLAY WOULD BE ANY ONE THAT GAINS YARDAGE. &gt;&gt; CURTIS MARTIN WE SAW THAT PASS. GO ALL THE WAY BACK OUR MINISTER OF INFORMATION, STEVE HURT, TELLING US IT WAS ALL THE WAY BACK IN 1951 THAT YOU HAD A T.D. PASS BY A RUNNING BACK IN THE LAST 2 MINUTES. DOAK WALKER DID IT. &gt;&gt; WOW. THAT STAT GAVE ME A MIGRAINE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE. IT WAS SO DEEP THAT MY HEAD HURTS. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. GET YOUR SPOT! &gt;&gt; UHOH. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 9. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE VOICE I HEAR IN MY HEAD ON A WEEKLY BASIS. [ WHISTLES BLOWING ] &gt;&gt; WALT COLEMAN WITH THE CALL. "PRIOR TO THE SNAP, FALSE START, 74," IF YOU CAN LIPREAD. THAT'S RYAN YOUNG. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE ONLY GUY ON THE FIELD WHO'S NOT MIKED IS THE REF. EVERYBODY ELSE I HEAR, LIKE CRYSTALCLEAR. &gt;&gt; THE ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT THOSE TRICK PLAYS AND EVERYTHING, AL. YOU CAN'T RUN TRICK PLAYS UNLESS YOU'RE PERFORMING WELL IN ALL OTHER PHASES OF THE GAME. AND RIGHT NOW, THE JETS LOOK AWFUL. &gt;&gt; DAN HENNING. &gt;&gt; YEP. &gt;&gt; DAN HENNING, THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, TRYING TO GET HIS UNIT ON TRACK. AND THIS IS RICHIE ANDERSON. HIS FIRST CARRY, AND THAT DOESN'T GET THEM ON TRACK. &gt;&gt; THE DOLPHINS HAVE ALLOWED ONLY THREE TOUCHDOWNS ALL SEASON. VINNY TESTAVERDE SAYS HE KNOWS THE DOLPHINS ARE GOOD ON DEFENSE. THEY CAN'T GET FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW. HE KNOWS THAT THEY CAN COME BACK. BUT THIS IS THE LARGEST DEFICIT THEY'VE HAD TO FACE THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt; THIRD AND 17 AS THE SECOND QUARTER BEGINS IN THE MEADOWLANDS. AND VINNY THROWS. AND IT IS INTERCEPTED BY SAM MADISON, THE PRO BOWL CORNERBACK, AT THE NEW YORK 42YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO WONDER ABOUT TESTAVERDE. HE HAD THAT NERVE PROBLEM. THIS IS ONLY HIS SIXTH GAME COMING BACK AFTER THE ACHILLES INJURY. LAVERANUES COLES OUT HERE, RUNNING TO THE INSIDE. BUT THAT'S WHERE MADISON WAS TO START WITH. HE LET COLES GO TO THE OUTSIDE KNOWING HE HAD HELP DEEP. THIS IS JUST A SUPER JOB BY A PRO BOWL CORNER, KNOWING THE DEFENSE. SEE, THAT WAS HIS HELP DEEP NUMBER 45 THERE. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS SMITH ON FIRST DOWN. SO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL, THEY CONTINUE TO DOMINATE AFTER MADISON'S THIRD INTERCEPTION OF THE SEASON. AND THAT'S A FIRST DOWN TO THE 25YARD LINE. AND SMITH TONIGHT, WITH THAT 68YARD TOUCHDOWN BURST, IS ALREADY OVER 100 YARDS ON THE GROUND. THAT'S EIGHT CARRIES, 105 YARDS FOR LAMAR SMITH. &gt;&gt; TOTAL DOMINATION. &gt;&gt; COREY DILLON'S NEW RECORD MAY LAST A DAY. THE 25YARD LINE. ROB KONRAD. IF YOU MISSED IT, YESTERDAY COREY DILLON OF THE BENGALS ECLIPSED WALTER PAYTON'S LONGSTANDING RECORD BY RUSHING FOR 278 YARDS AGAINST DENVER. &gt;&gt; AND AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THIS IS WHAT'S KILLING THE JETS RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE HAD JUST ABSOLUTELY NO SUCCESS AT ALL ON OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 8. FIEDLER THROWING FOR THE END ZONE. IT FLOATS, AND IT'S INCOMPLETE. AND VERY UPSET WITH HIMSELF IS MARCUS COLEMAN. EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED HERE WAS A TURNOVER. AND COLEMAN MISJUDGED WHEN THE BALL CAME DOWN. MIGHT HAVE HAD IT PICKED OFF OTHERWISE. &gt;&gt; YEAH, JAY FIEDLER GOT AWAY WITH ONE HERE. LOOK AT COLEMAN, 42. HE'S GOT HIS EYE ON THE BALL THE WHOLE WAY. AND I THINK GADSDEN'S GONNA INTERFERE WITH HIM RIGHT THERE. THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN CALLED OFFENSIVE PASS INTERFERENCE AGAINST ORONDE GADSDEN. LOOK AT GADSDEN GO INTO COLEMAN. AND COLEMAN SHOWS THE HANDS OF A DEFENSIVE BACK. IF HE COULD CATCH, HE'D PROBABLY BE PLAYING WIDE RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; AND, DANNY, THE SAME PASSINTERFERENCE RULES APPLY WHEN THE SITUATION INVERTS LIKE THAT? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THIRD DOWN AND 8. INSIDE HANDOFF TO THURMAN THOMAS. BUT HE STUMBLES ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. AND THE LONGTIME BUFFALO BILL, WHO PERPETUATES HIS CAREER BY SIGNING WITH MIAMI AS A THIRDDOWN BACK, CAN'T GET ON TRACK, AND THEY'LL HAVE TO SETTLE FOR A MARE FIELDGOAL ATTEMPT OF ABOUT 42 TO 43 YARDS. &gt;&gt; MARE DRILLS THIS, HE'S THE MOST ACCURATE KICKER IN THE HISTORY OF PRO FOOTBALL. NEEDED 100. THIS WOULD BE HIS 100th, AND THIS WOULD PUT HIM UP AROUND 83%. HE'D BE THE MOST ACCURATE TO THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO MAKE 100. SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE TO ATTEMPT 100. YOU HAVE TO MAKE 100. THIS WOULD BE NUMBER 100 FOR HIM. FROM 43 YARDS OUT. RIGHT DOWN BROADWAY. 12:57 TO THE HALF. WELL, MARE HAS NOW MADE 100 FIELD GOALS, AND THAT'S THE MINIMUM REQUIRED. THE HIGHEST FIELDGOAL PERCENTAGE IN HISTORY. HOLLIS OF THE JAGUARS, THEN JOHN CARNEY, THE LONGTIME CHARGER. STOVER'S STILL KICKING WITH BALTIMORE. TODD PETERSON WOULD BE FIFTH. &gt;&gt; SEE, THAT GRAPHIC EXPLAINED IT MUCH BETTER, AL. I'M JUST PUMPED UP TONIGHT. I'M YAKKING TOO MUCH. BUT THAT GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU WHAT I MEANT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S KEVIN WILLIAMS FIELDING IT AT THE 6YARD LINE. HE CAN ONLY GET IT TO THE 11YARD LINE. TESTAVERDE CAN'T GET ON TRACK. BACKUP QUARTERBACK IS RAY LUCAS. AND THE NUMBERTHREE QUARTERBACK IS CHAD PENNINGTON, THE ROOKIE FROM MARSHALL. VINNY LOOKED GOOD THROWING THAT ONE, EXCEPT IN TERMS OF HE COULDN'T GET IT IN TO CHREBET, WHO WAS DOUBLECOVERED ON THE PLAY. SECOND DOWN AND 10. &gt;&gt; IT JUST CONTINUES, AL. THIS IS ILLEGAL PROCEDURE AGAINST THE JETS. TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THE FORMATION SET, AND THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MEN ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AS THEY WENT EMPTY IN THE BACKFIELD. BUT YOU'RE SEEING POOR PLAY BY THE OFFENSE. IT'S INFECTING THE SPECIAL TEAMS. THEY HAD A TERRIBLE KICKOFF RETURN THERE. AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE BACKED UP EVEN FURTHER. &gt;&gt; ILLEGAL FORMATION ON THE OFFENSE. NUMBER 69 WAS THE END MAN ON THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE HE WANTS TO SEE A LOT OF TIME THIS YEAR. HE'S IN A PERFECT POSITION FOR A RESTRICTED FREE AGENT AT THE END OF THE YEAR, LIKE ROB JOHNSON. THE LESS HE SHOWS, THE MORE &gt;&gt; HERE'S CURTIS MARTIN. CAN'T GET ON TRACK. &gt;&gt; THE LESS HE SHOWS, THE MORE HE CAN BANK ON HIS POTENTIAL IN THE OFFSEASON AND GET A BIG CONTRACT LIKE JOHNSON DID WITHOUT HAVING TO PLAY MUCH. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TELL THE TYPE OF START WE'RE SEEING IN THESE TWO QUARTERBACKS. JAY FIEDLER 113 YARDS PASSING IN THE FIRST QUARTER. &gt;&gt; GREW UP IN OCEANSIDE, DID FIEDLER. INTERESTING, AS YOU LOOK AT HIM THERE'S AN UNDRAFTED GUY GOING AGAINST A GUY WHO WAS THE NUMBERONE PICK IN THE DRAFT. VINNY SETS UP THE SCREEN. RICHIE ANDERSON MAKES THE CATCH. AND HE TAKES IT OUT TO THE 24YARD LINE. BUT HE DOESN'T GET THE FIRST DOWN, AND THEY'RE FORCED TO PUNT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND, YOU KNOW, HE HESITATED AFTER HE CAUGHT THE BALL. HE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS BLOCKING. BUT THIS PLAY WAS THE JETS' BEST PLAY OF THE GAME. SO WELL DESIGNED. OUT IN FRONT, IT'S GONNA BE FABINI, 69, HERE. AND WATCH AFTER THE CATCH. FABINI COMES BACK AND TAKES OUT TAYLOR. IT'S KEVIN MAWAE, 68, RATHER, WHO'S OUT IN FRONT. BUT THE HESITATION COST ANDERSON AND THE JETS A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THE JETS HAVE NOW HAD FIVE POSSESSIONS. FOUR HAVE BEEN THREEANDOUT. THE OTHER ENDED WITH A SAM MADISON PICK. TUPA'S PUNT, A LINER. &gt;&gt; THERE'S BANTA, 81. AND HE SNAPPED, BUT A DOLPHIN PLAYER FLOPPED. DID THE ROPEADOPE AND WENT DOWN AFTER A LITTLE SHOVE. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PERSONAL FOUL ON BANTA. AND ANOTHER ONE. SO BOTH FLAGS INDEED THAT IS CORRECT. &gt;&gt; WELL, LET'S SEE IF IT WAS A FLOP JOB OR LEGIT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S THE FIRST PENALTY THERE, AS HE PUSHES JERRY WILSON AWAY, AND NOW &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TWO PERSONAL FOULS. A PERSONAL FOUL ON THE JETS, NUMBER 81. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. WE HAVE ANOTHER PERSONAL FOUL ON NUMBER 81 OF THE JETS. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ACCEPTED. 15 YARDS. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS LAMAR SMITH ON FIRST DOWN. TAKING THE BALL ACROSS THE 50YARD LINE TO THE NEW YORK 49. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GIVE IT TO WANNSTEDT. HE'S GOT THIS TEAM HONED TO A FINE EDGE, AL. THE LAST FOUR TIMES THE DOLPHINS HAVE COME OFF A BYE, THEY LOST THREE OF THE GAMES. SO IT'S NOT THEIR REGULAR SCENE TO SHOW UP AFTER A BYE. BUT THEY LOOK SHARP AS YOU CAN TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DAVE'S HOME STADIUM IN 1993. WHEN RAY HANDLEY WAS FIRED BY THE NEW YORK GIANTS, TOM COUGHLIN WAS THE NUMBERONE CHOICE. DECLINED IT. AND WANNSTEDT HAD HIS CHOICE BETWEEN THE GIANTS JOB OR THE BEARS JOB AND CHOSE CHICAGO. AND DAN REEVES WOUND UP WITH THE GIANTS JOB. AS THIS IS LAMAR SMITH TO THE 45YARD LINE. DAVE, THE DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR UNDER JIMMY JOHNSON. THIRD DOWN AND 4 FROM THE 45YARD LINE. FIEDLER PUMPFAKES. WIDE OPEN AND MAKING THE CATCH IS GADSDEN! AND THEN FROST GETS OVER THERE TO SAVE THE TOUCHDOWN! &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SAFETY HELP, AND THEN THERE'S SAFETY HELP THE NEXT WEEK. &gt;&gt; SHEPHERD IS 84. GADSDEN RIGHT HERE. ACTUALLY, IT'S THURMAN THOMAS. THEY FAKE THE QUICK SCREEN TO THE OUTSIDE. AGAIN A WELLDESIGNED PLAY, AS THEY JUST FOOLED THE JETS WITH THE FAKE SCREEN TO THE OUTSIDE. AND LOOK AT THAT CATCH BY GADSDEN. GADSDEN'S HAVING A HECK OF A DAY FOUR CATCHES NOW, 89 YARDS. AND FIEDLER PUTS ANOTHER ONE RIGHT ON HIS FINGERTIPS. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 16 WITH THE CROWD IN STUNNED SILENCE. SMITH. HE GETS TAKEN DOWN. AND BRYAN COX TURNS IN THAT PLAY. AND LET'S CHECK IN WITH MELISSA STARK. &gt;&gt; AL, TONIGHT IS THE SECOND TIME THAT JAY FIEDLER AND AL GROH HAVE MET. THE FIRST TIME WAS TWO YEARS AGO. FIEDLER WAS 26 YEARS OLD. HE WAS AN OUTOFWORK QUARTERBACK STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT IN THE NFL. GROH WAS AN ASSISTANT WITH THE JETS, AND HE TALKED TO FIEDLER AS A FAVOR. AND HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD HIM. "YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC. NO ONE'S SEEN YOU PLAY IN TWO YEARS. PERHAPS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS OF PLAYING IN THE NFL AND PUT THAT DARTMOUTH EDUCATION TO GOOD USE." WELL, FIEDLER KNOWS THAT GROH MEANT WELL, BUT OBVIOUSLY HE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HE SAID. AND FIEDLER SAYS THAT THAT CONVERSATION WAS A TURNING POINT IN HIS CAREER. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE PERSEVERED. HE TOSSES THIS ONE BACK TO KONRAD. TO THE 18YARD LINE. YOU LOOK AT A KID LIKE FIEDLER. HE'S AN UNDRAFTED FREE AGENT. HE SITS ON THE BENCH AT PHILADELPHIA IN '94, '95, AND '96. HE PLAYS WITH AMSTERDAM IN THE WORLD LEAGUE IN '97. THEN A BACKUP IN MINNESOTA AND JACKSONVILLE IN '98 AND '99. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT THREE QUARTERBACKS STARTING IN THE NFL OR YOU DID TILL YESTERDAY, WHEN WARNER WENT OUT WHO WERE UNDRAFTED COMING OUT OF COLLEGE. IT'S FIEDLER, KURT WARNER, AND JEFF GARCIA. SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD START LOOKING FOR GUYS AFTER THE SEVENTH ROUND TO LEAD YOUR TEAM. &gt;&gt; UPDATE ON WARNER, BY THE WAY THE BROKEN PINKIE. A COUPLE OF PINS WILL PROBABLY BE PUT IN TOMORROW, AND THEY HOPE TO HAVE HIM BACK IN FOUR WEEKS. MEANWHILE, IT'S TRENT GREEN. THIRD DOWN AND 12. FIEDLER THROWING. AND IT'S KNOCKED DOWN AS AARON GLENN GOES OVER THE BACK OF LESLIE SHEPHERD TO KNOCK IT DOWN. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] E.D. LIKED IT, DIDN'T HE? &gt;&gt; YEAH. ERIC IS RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? AARON GLENN SHOULD'VE INTERCEPTED THIS PASS. IT WAS FLOATING OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME. I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT ERIC TOLD AARON GLENN "MAN, YOU SHOULD'VE PICKED THAT ONE OFF." HERE HE IS. WATCH HOW LONG THIS BALL IS IN THE AIR, AND LOOK AT WHEN A DEFENSIVE BACK CAN GET TWO HANDS ON THE BALL TO KNOCK IT DOWN, USE THOSE TWO HANDS TO CATCH THE BALL! &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO SEE HIM HUG E.D. IT'S COOL. &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE MARE, A 36YARD ATTEMPT. IF HE MISSES IT, HOLLIS HAS THE RECORD BACK. AND HE DOES! THE NEW YORK JETS HAVE THE BALL AT THEIR OWN 26YARD LINE. STILL SEEKING A FIRST DOWN. THEY'RE DOWN 200. AND TESTAVERDE THROWS. AND THAT'S OFF THE FINGERTIPS OF THE TIGHT END, FRED BAXTER. SECOND DOWN AND 10 FROM THE 26YARD LINE. CHREBET IN MOTION. IT IS CAUGHT UP AT THE 34YARD LINE BY CURTIS MARTIN, BUT HE'S SHY OF THE FIRST DOWN. THE JETS NOW FINALLY HAVE MORE YARDAGE ON OFFENSE THAN THEY HAVE IN PENALTIES. &gt;&gt; WELL, OLINDO MARE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN A SKOSH HERE. THEY GOT TO KICK THE CHAIN LOCK IN NOW. DEFINITELY NEED SOME POINTS HERE. VINNY VIDI VICI. COME ON. GET US A GAME, BABE. &gt;&gt; THEY NEED A FIRST DOWN FOR STARTERS. THIRD DOWN AND 1. &gt;&gt; CURTIS MARTIN. BEST FIRSTDOWN GUY IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; ANDERSON IS THE BLOCKING BACK. &gt;&gt; POUND IT. &gt;&gt; THEY GIVE IT TO ANDERSON, AND HE GETS THE FIRST DOWN. THEY'LL TAKE IT ANY WAY THEY CAN GET IT. [ CROWD CHEERING ] AND THE BRONX CHEER IN NEW JERSEY. SO IT TAKES 23 MINUTES, BUT THE JETS FINALLY MOVE THE CHAINS. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU STILL GIVE THE BRONX CHEER IN JERSEY? &gt;&gt; YES, YOU CAN. SECAUCUS CHEER. &gt;&gt; YEAH. ANNOTATE THAT. &gt;&gt; I CAME HERE THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL, BY THE WAY, TONIGHT. MY LIMO DRIVER HAD A UNIQUE ROUTE. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 39YARD LINE. ANDERSON ON THE LITTLE TOSS BACK TO MARTIN. SO A LITTLE TRICKERY. AND MARTIN DEEP INTO DOLPHIN TERRITORY. TO THE 27YARD LINE. BRIAN WALKER MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. LET'S GET A GAME GOING HERE. CHREBET WAS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO CLOCK. DID YOU SEE HIM COMING? &gt;&gt; THEY GET THE FIRST DOWN WITH ANDERSON, AND NOW THEY SHOW HIS VERSATILITY AS HE USES THE OLD OPTION PLAY TO GET MARTIN DOWN THE FIELD. WE TALKED ABOUT AL GROH AND DAN HENNING AND HOW MUCH THEY LIKE TO GO WITH THESE SITUATIONALLY APPROPRIATE PLAYS. &gt;&gt; AND AT THE 27YARD LINE AFTER A 34YARD GAIN, WITH 5:40 TO GO IN THE FIRST HALF. VINNY GIVES IT TO MARTIN. AND HERE THEY GO AGAIN ON AN END AROUND TO DWIGHT STONE. AND A FLAG COMES IN AS STONE GETS BANGED HARD AT THE 22 BY BRIAN WALKER AND JERMAINE HALEY. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GONNA GET KEVIN MAWAE FOR AN ILLEGAL BLOCK. JETS GOING WITH TWO TRICK PLAYS IN A ROW. BUT AGAIN THEY'RE THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY. MAWAE IS THE CENTER, AND AFTER THE REVERSE, CHECK HIM OUT. VINNY WITH THE NICE BLOCK ON TAYLOR. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. 68, OFFENSE. 10 YARDS. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; MAWAE WAS HOLDING ON SAM MADISON. THAT'S KIND OF A MISMATCH OUT THERE AS FAR AS QUICKNESS IS CONCERNED. &gt;&gt; WOW. WHEN MAWAE KNOCKS YOU UNCONSCIOUS, THE LAST THING YOU SEE IS THAT CRUCIFIX ON HIS FACE MASK. &gt;&gt; I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE A HOOD ORNAMENT. &gt;&gt; LAST RITES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY GOT AROUND THE AMEN CORNER ON THAT ONE. SORRY. I HAD TO SAY IT. IT'S BAD. I TAKE IT BACK. I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN IT. THERE'S ONLY 25 MILLION PEOPLE. EVERYBODY ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN AND 16. AND THAT IS DROPPED BY LAVERANUES COLES AT THE 22YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; LAVERANUES. WHAT A MOMENTUM BREAKER. YOU GOT TO HANG ON. &gt;&gt; TESTAVERDE IS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THIS PLAY. THE DOLPHINS ELECT TO USE ONE OF THEIR RARE BLITZES. THEY SENT EVERYBODY RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE. WATCH THE BLITZ. THERE'S THOMAS COMING. ROBERT JONES. IT'S WELL PICKED UP. AND THIS BALL IS PERFECTLY THROWN TO LAVERANUES COLES. THE ROOKIE CAN'T MAKE THE CATCH, OR THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A HUGE PLAY FOR THE JETS, WHO NEED A HUGE PLAY. &gt;&gt; HE KEEPS DROPPING BALLS LIKE THAT, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO USE THAT 4.19 40 SPEED TO RUN AWAY FROM AL GROH AT THE HALFTIME. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 16. FLAG. VINNY THROWS DEEP. AND A DIVING CHREBET CANNOT HAUL IT IN AT THE 5YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WOULDN'T HAVE COUNTED ANYWAY. THE JETS HAD ANOTHER ILLEGAL FORMATION. &gt;&gt; THEY DID. SO GROH WILL WATCH HIS TEAM LOSE MORE YARDAGE. &gt;&gt; ILLEGAL FORMATION, OFFENSE. 69 WAS THE END MAN ON THE LINE. PENALTY IS DECLINED. THIRD DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A GOOD THING CHREBET DIDN'T MAKE THE CATCH THERE, BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN WASTED. DIDN'T MAKE THE CATCH THERE, &gt;&gt; DANNO, NEXT TIME THAT ILLEGAL BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN WASTED. FORMATION HAPPENS, YOU GOT TO &gt;&gt; DANNO, NEXT TIME THAT ILLEGAL BREAK IT DOWN AND SHOW IT TO ME, FORMATION HAPPENS, YOU GOT TO 'CAUSE I NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT. BREAK IT DOWN AND SHOW IT TO ME, &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 16. 'CAUSE I NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT. AND THAT IS JERALD SOWELL WHO &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 16. GETS TAKEN DOWN, TO THE AND THAT IS JERALD SOWELL WHO CASCADING BOOS FROM THIS CROWD GETS TAKEN DOWN, TO THE OF MORE THAN 75,000. CASCADING BOOS FROM THIS CROWD &gt;&gt; TRYING TO OUTGUESS THE OF MORE THAN 75,000. DOLPHIN DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; TRYING TO OUTGUESS THE LET'S GO BACK, DENNIS. DOLPHIN DEFENSE. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT EXACTLY LET'S GO BACK, DENNIS. HAPPENED FOR THE JETS. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT EXACTLY LAVERANUES COLES IS RIGHT HERE. HAPPENED FOR THE JETS. HE'S GOT TO BE UP ON THE LINE OF LAVERANUES COLES IS RIGHT HERE. SCRIMMAGE. HE'S GOT TO BE UP ON THE LINE OF HE'S NOT. SCRIMMAGE. MARTIN COMES BACK IN MOTION. HE'S NOT. AND THIS IS FABINI. MARTIN COMES BACK IN MOTION. HE IS THE LAST MAN ON THE LINE AND THIS IS FABINI. OF SCRIMMAGE. HE IS THE LAST MAN ON THE LINE SO THIS IS A ROOKIE MISTAKE BY OF SCRIMMAGE. LAVERANUES COLES. SO THIS IS A ROOKIE MISTAKE BY TWICE NOW IN THE GAME, HE HAS LAVERANUES COLES. FAILED TO LINE UP ON THE LINE OF TWICE NOW IN THE GAME, HE HAS SCRIMMAGE. FAILED TO LINE UP ON THE LINE OF &gt;&gt; AND THE TWO PENALTIES TOOK SCRIMMAGE. THEM OUT OF FIELDGOAL RANGE. &gt;&gt; AND THE TWO PENALTIES TOOK SO TUPA HAS TO PUNT. THEM OUT OF FIELDGOAL RANGE. AND IT IS DOWNED INSIDE THE 10. SO TUPA HAS TO PUNT. MIAMI WILL TAKE OVER AT THE AND IT IS DOWNED INSIDE THE 10. 8YARD LINE. MIAMI WILL TAKE OVER AT THE SO 4:15 LEFT IN AN OPENING HALF. 8YARD LINE. MIAMI HAS IT AT THE 8YARD LINE. SO 4:15 LEFT IN AN OPENING HALF. 4:15 REMAINING IN THE FIRST MIAMI HAS IT AT THE 8YARD LINE. HALF. 4:15 REMAINING IN THE FIRST DOLPHINS LEADING 200. HALF. AND THIS IS SMITH. DOLPHINS LEADING 200. LAMAR UP TO THE 11. AND THIS IS SMITH. WHEN THEY PICKED UP SMITH FROM LAMAR UP TO THE 11. NEW ORLEANS, DAVE WANNSTEDT DID WHEN THEY PICKED UP SMITH FROM NOT THINK OF HIM AS A FEATURE NEW ORLEANS, DAVE WANNSTEDT DID BACK. NOT THINK OF HIM AS A FEATURE THEY HAD J.J. JOHNSON, A GUY BACK. THAT HAS BEEN INACTIVE FOR A THEY HAD J.J. JOHNSON, A GUY COUPLE OF GAMES THIS YEAR. THAT HAS BEEN INACTIVE FOR A PLAYING TONIGHT. COUPLE OF GAMES THIS YEAR. BUT LAMAR SMITH, GETTING AN PLAYING TONIGHT. OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY EVERY DAY, BUT LAMAR SMITH, GETTING AN HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY EVERY DAY, &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE WEARING OUT THE HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB. RIGHT SIDE OF THEIR OFFENSE, &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE WEARING OUT THE THE JETS' DEFENSIVE LEFT SIDE. HE'S ALREADY OVER 100 YARDS, AND I WOULD BET YOU THAT 90% OF HIS YARDS ARE OFF THAT RIGHT SIDE. &gt;&gt; SO HE HAD A BIG OPENING GAME. NOT A LOT SINCE. AND TONIGHT A BIG GAME, UNTIL MARVIN JONES SAYS, "ENOUGH ALREADY." &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, THE DOLPHINS IN THE PAST, WHEN THEY'VE STARTED HOT, OFTEN FOLD LIKE ONE OF THOSE RAZOR SCOOTERS THAT YOUR KID'S RIDING AROUND ON. BUT JASON TAYLOR SAID LAST YEAR'S 51 START, HE DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN IT. BUT THIS YEAR IT FEELS SOLID, DOESN'T IT? I MEAN, EVERY UNIT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF TALENT HERE. &gt;&gt; IT FEELS SOLID AFTER TONIGHT OR AT LEAST TO THIS POINT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THE OFFENSE WASN'T QUITE CLICKING, BUT I THINK WANNSTEDT WAS GETTING WHAT HE WANTED OUT OF IT IN THE FIRST SIX GAMES, WHICH IS A SYNERGY WITH THE DEFENSE KEEPING THEM OFF THE FIELD. YOU ADD IN A PASSING ATTACK, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TEAM THAT'S GONNA GO FAR IN THE PLAYOFFS. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; FIEDLER HANDS THE BALL. AND THAT'S THOMAS SLIPPING AGAIN. SO THURMAN THOMAS, ON HIS LAST TWO CARRIES, HAS BEEN UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GREAT PLAY BY SHANE BURTON, KNIFING IN THERE AND GETTING THOMAS BEFORE HE CAN GET STARTED. THAT'S WHAT THE JETS NEED. &gt;&gt; FOURTH DOWN. FOURTH AND 10 FROM THE 7YARD LINE. DEDRIC WARD IS BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK. DOLPHINS TAKING AS MUCH TIME OFF THE PLAY CLOCK AS THEY CAN. MATT TURK, THE EXREDSKIN. GOOD, DEEP, BOOMING KICK. WARD AT THE 40YARD LINE. HAS A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM, AND IT'S AN 11YARD RUNBACK, TO THE 49 OF THE DOLPHINS. [ CHUCKLES ] THERE'S LAMAR SMITH, WITH 109 YARDS. CURTIS MARTIN TONIGHT GOOD AVERAGE, BUT HE'S ONLY BEEN ABLE TO CARRY THE BALL FIVE TIMES. THE DOLPHINS HAVE DOMINATED THE GAME. THEY'VE HAD THE BALL 17 MINUTES TO THE JETS' 10. FIRST AND 10. AND THAT IS INTERCEPTED BY PATRICK SURTAIN! WHAT A NIGHT FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; GOT TO GO TO THE BULLPEN, I THINK, HERE. &gt;&gt; PATRICK SURTAIN. BIG FIRSTDOWNSAVING TACKLE EARLY. THE APPROPRIATE TIMEOUT CALLED TO SAVE ANOTHER FIRST DOWN. NOW A PICK. &gt;&gt; AND REALLY TESTAVERDE HAS NO BUSINESS THROWING THIS BALL. SURTAIN PLAYS THAT PERFECTLY. LOCATES THE BALL AND THEN SNATCHES IT OUT OF THE AIR. AND THE JETS, WITH GREAT FIELD POSITION, THROW IT RIGHT BACK TO THE DOLPHINS WITH THE SECOND INTERCEPTION OF THE NIGHT BY TESTAVERDE, WHO REALLY LOOKS OUT OF SYNC. AND THE WAY HE LOOKS IS KIND OF INFECTING THE ENTIRE TEAM. THEY'RE SLOW. THEY'RE MAKING MENTAL MISTAKES. AND NOW THEY'RE TURNING OVER THE BALL TO THE DOLPHINS. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO BE MEAN, BUT HAVEN'T I HEARD IN THE PAST THE VINNY TESTAVERDE IS COLORBLIND? HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THAT? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT PLAY LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BEAR THAT OUT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STILL SEE SHADES, THOUGH, AND YOU SEE THE DARKERSHADE JERSEY. THAT'S THE ONE YOU WANT TO THROW TO. &gt;&gt; JUST TRYING TO HELP MY MAN VINNY. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 10YARD LINE ON FIRST DOWN. THAT'S DROPPED. AND THAT'S THURMAN THOMAS. SO THURMAN'S BEEN SLIPPING AND SLIDING AND DROPPING FOOTBALLS. VERY UNTHURMANLIKE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. THURMAN JUST NEEDS 88 YARDS OR SO TO PASS FRANCO HARRIS TO MOVE INTO EIGHTH PLACE. &gt;&gt; ON SECOND AND 10, THEY GIVE THE BALL TO THOMAS. AND THURMAN THIS TIME TAKES IT UP TO THE 15YARD LINE. THAT TAKES US TO THE 2MINUTE WARNING. &gt;&gt; JASON TAYLOR. &gt;&gt; YOU SPENT $45 TO COME WATCH ME PLAY. &gt;&gt; HE'S OUR GUY WHO'S MIKED UP. WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM AT THE HALF. 2 MINUTES LEFT IN THE HALF. AND ON A QUARTERBACK DRAW, THAT IS FIEDLER TAKING IT UP TO THE 18YARD LINE. BUT IT'S FOURTH DOWN AND 2. MO LEWIS MAKES THE TACKLE. DEDRIC WARD FAIRCATCHING A PUNT BY TURK, A 35YARD KICK, WITH 1:44 REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF. AND THE GRIM FIGURES FOR VINNY TESTAVERDE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A MISERABLE NIGHT NOT ONLY FOR TESTAVERDE BUT FOR THIS ENTIRE JET TEAM SO FAR. &gt;&gt; WELL, WE'VE GOT TO FAN THE EMBER HERE. WE NEED A SCORE TO GET US INTO THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 47YARD LINE. VINNY WHEELING AND THEN HITS ANDERSON. AND ANDERSON IS TAKEN DOWN BY MARION AND OUT OF BOUNDS TO SAVE A TIMEOUT AT THE 41YARD LINE. AND A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. A LITTLE RHYTHM. THAT'S A NICE RHYTHM PLAY. GET SOME RHYTHM GOING HERE. FLICK THAT JAB. &gt;&gt; THE SCREEN HAS BEEN GOOD TO THE JETS TONIGHT. THAT WAS WELL EXECUTED BY TESTAVERDE, FAKING TO THE LEFT. BIG RANDY THOMAS GOT OUT IN FRONT OF ANDERSON AND GOT HIM DOWN THE SIDELINES. NOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TESTAVERDE TO JUST MANAGE THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD. DON'T TRY TO FORCE ANYTHING. THESE CORNERS ARE TOO GOOD TO TRY TO GET THEM DEEP. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 40YARD LINE. FOURMAN RUSH. AND THEY GIVE IT TO MARTIN. HE TAKES IT TO THE 32YARD LINE. [ WHISTLES BLOWING ] ALTERCATION. THAT, FOR THE MOMENT, STOPS THE CLOCK. THE JETS DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A TIMEOUT. THE CLOCK RESTARTS. THEY CONSERVE THEIR TWO TIMEOUTS. AND ON SECOND AND 2, TESTAVERDE OUT OF THE GUN. GOING TO THE CORNER. AND IT'S FLICKED AWAY. DOUBLE COVERAGE. BUT A PENALTY MARKER ON THE PASS INTENDED FOR COLES. &gt;&gt; GONNA GET BRIAN WALKER FOR AN ILLEGAL HIT ON A DEFENSELESS PLAYER. COLES HAD NO SHOT AT CATCHING THIS BALL, AND WALKER CAME IN HEADHIGH, TRYING TO TAKE COLES' HEAD OFF. &gt;&gt; WALKER ALMOST TOOK MARTIN'S HEAD OFF ON THE PREVIOUS PLAY. &gt;&gt; THIS WILL BE A 15YARDER. TESTAVERDE TRYING TO FORCE ONE DOWN THE FIELD, DEEP ON THE FADE TO COLES. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, 45 OF THE DEFENSE HITTING A DEFENSELESS RECEIVER. 15 YARDS. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE VINNY'S GOING INTO SOME OF THESE PLAYS WITH AN AGENDA AND HE'S NOT GONNA DEVIATE IT, EVEN IF THERE'S DOUBLE COVERAGE. THERE ARE THOSE NIGHTS WHERE HE PICKS UP THE SECOND RECEIVER. TONIGHT HE'S JUST LOOKING THE ONE OOH. &gt;&gt; THERE'S THE SHOT BY WALKER. MADISON ACTUALLY GOT A HAND ON THE BALL. IT'S GONNA BE 15 YARDS FROM THE PREVIOUS SPOT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT MOVES IT TO THE 17YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; JUST LOOKS A LITTLE LOCKED ON, YOU KNOW, DAN? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT, DENNIS. WHEN YOU SEE BUMPANDRUN, YOU'RE THINKING, "THROW THE FADE," WHICH IS THE ONE DOWN THE SIDELINES. BUT WHAT HE'S NOT SEEING ARE THE SAFETIES. PLUS, HIS RECEIVERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY BLOWING BY MADISON AND SURTAIN. &gt;&gt; THE DOLPHIN DEFENSE HAS ALLOWED THREE TOUCHDOWNS ALL SEASON. THAT'S 6 1/2 GAMES. HERE'S MARTIN. NO. TOOK A PITCH GOING RIGHT, CAME BACK THE OTHER WAY, AND ROBERT JONES SAID, "YOU DIDN'T FOOL ME." TIMEOUT, NEW YORK. 1:02 REMAINING IN THE HALF. ONE TIMEOUT LEFT FOR THE NEW YORK JETS. THE FEWEST TOUCHDOWNS ALLOWED IN THE FIRST SIX GAMES THE PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS IN '70, ATLANTA IN '77, AND THESE GUYS. SECOND AND 11 FROM THE 18YARD LINE. TESTAVERDE THROWING. ANDERSON MAKES THE CATCH. STARTED TO STUMBLE. KNOCKED OUT OF BOUNDS BY JONES AT THE 11YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; PURPLE PEOPLE EATERS DOESN'T SHOCK ME ON THAT GRAPHIC. BUT WHO THE HECK WAS PLAYING FOR ATLANTA IN '77? CLAUDE HUMPHREY, MAYBE, OR WHO WAS IT? &gt;&gt; UNBELIEVABLE. LEEMAN BENNETT WAS THE COACH. &gt;&gt; NOBIS, I GUESS. &gt;&gt; I THINK TOMMY WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE AT THAT TIME. &gt;&gt; TESTAVERDE FINALLY GETS SOME TIME TO THROW. THE OFFENSIVE LINE, AFTER THE PLAY FAKE, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. AND HE'S JUST REALLY GUIDING THAT BALL OUT TO RICHIE ANDERSON. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 4. HUGE PLAY FOR THE JETS AS THEY TRY TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME SOMEHOW, SOME WAY. AND TESTAVERDE THROWS. AND DOES IT! HITS CHREBET. TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; MONEY TIME. GO TO YOUR MONEY GUY. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; AND THE JETS WIND UP WITH GOOD FIELD POSITION AFTER THE PUNT. THEY GO 53 YARDS RAPIDLY. &gt;&gt; AND BRIAN WALKER'S UNNECESSARYROUGHNESS PENALTY COST THE DOLPHINS. WAYNE CHREBET'S FIRST CATCH OF THE NIGHT. HE MAKES IT A BIG ONE. &gt;&gt; CHREBET'S FOURTH TOUCHDOWN OF THE SEASON. JOHN HALL FOR THE EXTRA POINT. AND THE JETS, AFTER A MISERABLE FIRST 28 MINUTES, GET BACK INTO THE GAME. &gt;&gt; STICK AROUND, FOLKS. WE GOT A GAME. IF WE DON'T, WE'RE GONNA GET FREAKY IN THE SECOND HALF. &gt;&gt; [ CHUCKLES ] FREAKY ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; EITHER WAY, YOU DON'T LOSE. &gt;&gt; OH, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; NO, NO. THIS IS A BIG GAME. I SMELL THIS GAME. GROH WILL NOT LET THESE GUYS DIE ON HIM. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A GREAT PASS BY TESTAVERDE. NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DELIVERY POINT THAT TIME. HE REALLY CAME OVER THE TOP. THREW THE BALL UP HIGH FOR A REAL SHORT GUY 5'10". GREAT ROUTE, THOUGH. GOT INSIDE OF WALKER BEFORE MARION COULD GET OVER AND MAKE THE CLOSE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE A YOUNG GUY IN YOUR 20s, WOULD YOU WANT TO RUN OUT ON THE FIELD WITH A FLAG LIKE THAT? OH, SORRY. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU ASKING ME OR AL? I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I WAS 20. &gt;&gt; JETS TO KICK OFF WITH 53 SECONDS. BROCK MARION AND LESLIE SHEPHERD BACK TO RECEIVE FOR THE DOLPHINS. AND NOW J.J. JOHNSON DROPS BACK INSTEAD OF SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; JETS! JETS! JETS! JETS! &gt;&gt; TOWARD THE CORNER. AND OUT OF BOUNDS AT THE 8YARD LINE. OF ALL THINGS, IT'LL GIVE THE BALL TO MIAMI AT THE 40. FROM THE 40YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. FIEDLER THROWS. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE UP AT THE 44YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; GEORGIE, YOU'D BETTER WORK ON THE AVERAGES OVER THERE IF MARE MAKES ANOTHER ONE. GET THE CALCULATOR OUT. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 10 FROM THE 40YARD LINE. FIEDLER. HE'S GONNA SCRAMBLE. AND HE GETS THE FIRST DOWN. AND HE GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE NEW YORK 45. AND NOW THEY CAN TAKE A TIMEOUT. [ WHISTLES BLOWING ] &gt;&gt; IF THAT DOESN'T EPITOMIZE HOW POORLY THE JETS ARE PLAYING TONIGHT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES. FIEDLER WAS 3 YARDS SHORT OF THE FIRST DOWN WHEN THE FIRST JET GOT HIM. REMEMBER, THIS IS A QUARTERBACK, NOW. HE'S NOT AS BIG AS DAUNTE CULPEPPER, BUT I THINK HIS HEART IS. WATCH HIM LOWER HIS HEAD HERE, RUN THROUGH VICTOR GREEN, WHO'S A GREAT TACKLER, AND THEN TAKE ON A COUPLE OF DEFENSIVE BACKS. IT TAKES FIVE JETS TO BRING HIM DOWN! &gt;&gt; FIEDLER NOW WITH ONE TIMEOUT AT HIS DISPOSAL. BALL AT THE 46YARD LINE. TRYING TO GET AT LEAST INTO FIELDGOAL RANGE. AND THAT IS HAULED IN, AND A FIRST DOWN AT THE 34, BY ORONDE GADSDEN. &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT 50 YARDS AWAY FOR MARE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY WANT TO CONSERVE THEIR TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; OH, IT'S TAKING FOREVER FOR THE REFEREES TO GET THE BALL ON THE FIELD! &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. THEY'RE READY, AND BY THE TIME THEY GET THE BALL BACK IN THERE, IT COSTS THEM ANOTHER 10 SECONDS. AND NOW IT IS CAUGHT. AND THIS THOMAS, WHO GETS OUT OF BOUNDS WITH 8 SECONDS REMAINING. BUT IT TOOK AN INORDINATELY LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE OFFICIALS TO GET THE BALL READY FOR PLAY. THURMAN, YOU'RE RIGHT. I AGREE WITH YOU. WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS NOT DENNIS. [ Laughing ] THAT WAS THURMAN THOMAS. YOU THROW TO THE GUY THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE PLAY TO GET OUT OF BOUNDS, BUT THAT WAS INEXCUSABLE BY THE OFFICIALS, NOT HAVING THE BALL SET. DOLPHINS WOULD'VE HAD ANOTHER PLAY. &gt;&gt; WE NEED MORE MIKES ON THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; 44YARD FIELDGOAL ATTEMPT HERE FOR OLINDO MARE. HUARD TO HOLD. AND MARE'S KICK IS...GOOD. JUST GOOD. SO WITH 2 SECONDS REMAINING IN THE FIRST HALF, THE MIAMI DOLPHINS NOW ON TOP BY A SCORE OF 237. 237, MIAMI ON TOP. AND MARE WILL SEND A GROUND BALL TO THE 31YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; A LITTLE TOSSBACK HERE. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE CALIFORNIASTANFORD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS COLES. TACKLED AT THE 33YARD LINE. [ CROWD BOOING ] AND THE CROWD A VERY DISGRUNTLED CROWD, AS THE NEW YORK JETS HEAD BACK TO THEIR LOCKER ROOM, BECAUSE IN THIS BATTLE FOR UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE IN THE AFC EAST, MIAMI LEADS BY 16. LET'S CHECK IN WITH MELISSA. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, AL. THANKS. DAVE, AN ALMOST PERFECT FIRST HALF WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT JETS TOUCHDOWN. ANY CHANGES FOR THE SECOND HALF? &gt;&gt; WELL, NO. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THE PRESSURE ON, AND WE CAN'T SIT BACK, OBVIOUSLY. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FOOTBALL LEFT. WE LOST SOME FIELD POSITION ON THAT LAST DRIVE, AND THE 15YARD PENALTY OBVIOUSLY PUT THEM IN POSITION TO SCORE. &gt;&gt; AND WE BEGIN THE SECOND HALF AT GIANTS STADIUM IN EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY, AS OLINDO MARE GETS SET TO KICK OFF TO THE NEW YORK JETS, WHO WERE ABLE TO SCORE IN THE WANING MOMENTS OF THE FIRST HALF TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME. BUT MARE KICKED A FIELD GOAL TO TURN A 13POINT LEAD INTO A 16POINT LEAD. BACK DEEP TO RECEIVE FOR THE JETS WILLIAMS AND STONE. MARE WILL KICK OFF. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. IT'S A 3TO1 RATIO IN TERMS OF TOTAL YARDAGE FOR THE MIAMI DOLPHINS. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE DOLPHINS DEFENSE, THEY'RE AVERAGING GIVING UP JUST 8 1/2 POINTS A GAME. AND THE JETS HAVE 7, SO IT DOESN'T LOOK ALL THAT GOOD FOR THE JETS AGAINST THIS REALLY AGGRESSIVE AND ATHLETIC DEFENSE OF THE DOLPHINS. &gt;&gt; KEVIN WILLIAMS. BRINGS IT BACK OUT TO THE 26YARD LINE, AND THAT'S WHERE THE JETS WILL BEGIN THEIR FIRST POSSESSION. OTHER STATISTICS IN THE FIRST HALF. AND HE BEGINS THIS HALF THROWING TO CHREBET BUT FOR A VERY MINIMAL GAIN. WAYNE HAULS IT IN. CHREBET SCORED THE JETS' TOUCHDOWN IN THE FIRST HALF. AND FOR CHREBET TONIGHT, HIS SECOND CATCH. &gt;&gt; "PHANTOM PRESSURE," DANNO. I LOVE THAT LANGUAGE. IT'S LIKE WHEN THEY CUT ONE OF YOUR LIMBS OFF, YOU STILL FEEL PAIN IN IT, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. ALTHOUGH YOU'VE JUST GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF BAD LIMBS WORKING FOR YOU ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS, FOR TESTAVERDE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S FIEDLER. ABOUT A 3TO1 RATIO IN THAT DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF YARDAGE. SECOND DOWN AND 5. LITTLE TOSS BACK TO MARTIN. AND CURTIS ANGLES HIS WAY UP TO THE 32YARD LINE, WHERE IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 4 UPCOMING FOR THE JETS. THE WINNER OF THIS GAME IN UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE IN THE AFC EAST, AT 61. THE LOSER, OF COURSE, 52. AND THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS, THE PRESEASON FAVORITE, CONSENSUS FAVORITE THE COLTS WINNING YESTERDAY TO GO TO 52. MIAMI GOES HOME NEXT WEEK. THEY MEET GREEN BAY. AND FOR THE JETS, IT'S A TRIP TO BUFFALO. THIRD DOWN AND 4 FROM THE 32YARD LINE. AND THAT IS CHREBET, WHO CANNOT MAKE THE CATCH. WAYNE CHREBET, ON A LITTLE SLANT OVER THE MIDDLE, COULDN'T HAUL IT IN. THREE AND OUT FOR THE JETS. &gt;&gt; JERRY WILSON WITH THE COVERAGE THAT TIME ON CHREBET. OFTENTIMES, CHREBET WILL TRY TO LULL A DEFENSIVE BACK TO SLEEP AND THEN USE A BURST TO GET AWAY. AND RIGHT NOW, AL GROH CANNOT BE HAPPY WITH THIS START. THREE PLAYS, AND THEN YOU BRING OUT THE PUNTER, TOM TUPA. &gt;&gt; LESLIE SHEPHERD, WHO SCORED A TOUCHDOWN ON THE RECEIVING END OF A FIEDLER PASS IN THE FIRST HALF, TO RUN IT BACK. STANDING AT THE 20YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; TUPES HAS NEVER HAD ONE RETURNED FOR A T.D. SO WE'LL SEE IF THEY CAN BREAK THAT STREAK. &gt;&gt; WENT TO THE PRO BOWL. HE WON'T HAVE THIS ONE RETURNED AT ALL BECAUSE SHEPHERD FAIRCATCHES IT AT THE 28YARD LINE. 1:34 INTO THE THIRD QUARTER. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS IN TOWN? &gt;&gt; IN OUR MIDST. &gt;&gt; HEY! &gt;&gt; WHY NOT? &gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &gt;&gt; YOU COULDN'T GET A WORLD SERIES TICKET, SO YOU COME TO "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL," RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THIS IS FANTASTIC TO WATCH THIS GAME. IT IS MORE EXCITEMENT THAN ANY MOTION PICTURE. THIS IS REALLY GREAT. &gt;&gt; ARNOLD, I'M JUST BUDDYING UP TO YOU, BABE, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA SOMEDAY. &gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; TAKE CARE OF ME. I'M GETTING KILLED WITH THE STATE TAXES OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; IT WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF. TRUST ME. &gt;&gt; "READ MY LIPS RETROACTIVE TAX CUTS," RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 28YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. THIS IS FIEDLER THROWING. AND THAT'S KNOCKED DOWN. INTENDED FOR GADSDEN. KNOCKED DOWN BY MARCUS COLEMAN. YOU EVER BEEN TO A MONDAYNIGHT GAME BEFORE? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. AND I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. WAYNE CHREBET IS GONNA PULL IT OFF. I THINK, AS USUAL, THE JETS ARE GONNA COME FROM BEHIND. YOU WILL SEE. HE GIVES THEM SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU HEARD IT HERE. I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH HIM, ARE YOU, DENNIS? &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A GOOD "CONAN" LINE. &gt;&gt; I'M A JET FAN. &gt;&gt; HERE'S MY FAVORITE "CONAN" LINE. IT FITS FOOTBALL. "THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS TO MEET YOUR ENEMY ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE, TO CRUSH HIM BENEATH YOUR FEET, AND TO HEAR THE LAMENTATIONS OF HIS WOMAN." &gt;&gt; YEAH. IT'S VERY CLOSE. I LIKE IT. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; HERE'S LAMAR SMITH. WE'VE GOT A PENALTY. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE DOLPHINS HAVE TO BE TERMINATED. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; ROB KONRAD'S GONNA HELP YOU, ARNOLD, THERE WITH THAT HOLDING CALL. THIS WILL GIVE YOU AND THE JET FANS SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT. BUT THEY GOT A RATHER LARGE HILL TO CLIMB HERE. KONRAD IS NUMBER 44. HE WAS LEADING THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; HOLDING, 44, OFFENSE. 10 YARDS. REPEAT SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 20. FIEDLER LOOKING TO SCRAMBLE. THERE HE GOES. AND GETS TAKEN DOWN BY JASON FERGUSON. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, DENNIS, BUT I FEEL ALL PUMPED UP NOW. &gt;&gt; NOBODY SELLS THEIR PRODUCT LIKE MY MAN. THE GUY IS A DREAM MOVIE STAR. HE GETS OUT THERE AND HE SELLS THE SOAP. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 16. FIEDLER UNDER PRESSURE. THROWS INTO TRAFFIC AND INCOMPLETE. TRIED TO GET IT IN TO BERT EMANUEL, BUT HE WAS BRACKETED. FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; OFFENSIVE LINE'S BEEN DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB FOR FIEDLER TONIGHT. HE'S REALLY GONNA HANG ON TO THIS FOR A LONG TIME. HE'S GONNA PAY FOR IT, TOO, RIGHT THERE AS MO LEWIS KISSES HIM RIGHT UNDER THE CHIN. &gt;&gt; MATT TURK PLAYED HIS COLLEGE BALL AT WISCONSINWHITEWATER. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; KICKING TO DEDRIC WARD. 38YARD LINE. UP TO THE 44. THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT. MEANWHILE, TONIGHT, JETS DOWN BY 16. ON FIRST DOWN, VINNY THROWS. CAUGHT. MARTIN HAS SOME ROOM. AND CURTIS FIGHTS HIS WAY FOR A FIRST DOWN TO THE 45YARD LINE OF THE MIAMI DOLPHINS. &gt;&gt; IF THE PAST IS ANY INDICATOR THIS SEASON, VINNY ALWAYS PERKS UP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. LET'S HOPE IT HAPPENS AGAIN TONIGHT. HE JUST LIKES TO LET THEM GET OUT THERE A LITTLE, THEN HE COMES CHARGING UP FROM THE REAR. &gt;&gt; OF HIS 10 COMPLETIONS TONIGHT, THREE HAVE BEEN TO MARTIN AND THREE HAVE BEEN TO RICHIE ANDERSON. SO THE DOUBLE COVERAGE ON THE OUTSIDE. HE'S STARTING TO COME DOWN TO HIS BACKS, AND THEY'RE STARTING TO PAY OFF. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 46YARD LINE. VINNY ON A TIGHT ROLL. LOOKING DOWNFIELD. FLAG IS THROWN. AND THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. PATRICK SURTAIN LOCKED UP ON RICHIE ANDERSON. &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE THE WAY IT IS, TOO IT'S GONNA BE HOLDING AGAINST THE DOLPHINS IN THE SECONDARY. &gt;&gt; BERT EMANUEL, WHO'S CAUGHT SIX PASSES THIS SEASON AND SOMETIMES COMES IN AS THE QUARTERBACK IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, TO THE LOCKER ROOM. &gt;&gt; 5 YARDS. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; 5YARD VARIETY ON SURTAIN. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIG THING IS, IT IS A FIRST DOWN, SO THE JETS CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BALL. HERE IT IS ON THE OUTSIDE AGAINST RICHIE ANDERSON. AS ANDERSON NOT SURE. THERE'S THE HOLD RIGHT THERE, WITH THE RIGHT HAND. GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIAL. GOT AWAY WITH THE FIRST BUMP, BUT NOT THE SECOND ONE. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A SLY LITTLE HOLD. YOU GOT TO LIKE THAT. YOU GOT TO TRY THAT. &gt;&gt; HITTING HIM ON THE HIP. &gt;&gt; VINNY FROM THE 40. MARTIN. ZACH THOMAS TAKES HIM DOWN AT THE 38YARD LINE. LET'S CHECK IN WITH MELISSA. &gt;&gt; WELL, AL, WIDE RECEIVER BERT EMANUEL JUST LEFT THE FIELD. HE WAS HEADED TO THE LOCKER ROOM. HE HAS INJURED HIS LEFT WRIST. HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN. NO WORD YET ON HOW SERIOUS IT IS OR IF HE WILL RETURN. &gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER INJURY TO A DOLPHIN WIDEOUT. REMEMBER, THEY'RE MINUS TONY MARTIN. THEY LOST LAMAR THOMAS FOR THE SEASON IN PRESEASON. THERE'S VINNY'S LAST PASS. THEY HAVE McDUFFIE JUST COMING BACK. BOWENS GOT HIS HAND ON IT ON THAT PASS. &gt;&gt; CAME OUT OF THERE LIKE CHUCKIE KNOBLAUCH. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 8 FROM THE 38YARD LINE. AS TESTAVERDE THROWS! AND OPEN OVER THE MIDDLE IS MARTIN. HE TAKES IT TO THE 23YARD LINE. OR ANDERSON RICHIE ANDERSON MAKING THE CATCH. FIRST DOWN, JETS. &gt;&gt; AND VINNY TOLD ME THAT WITH THE DEPARTURE OF KEYSHAWN JOHNSON TO TAMPA BAY, ONE OF THE GUYS THEY COUNTED ON TO PICK UP THE SLACK IS RICHIE ANDERSON. HE'S NOT A GREAT PLAYER AT ANY ONE POSITION, BUT HE'S A GOOD PLAYER AT SEVERAL. HE PLAYS FULLBACK, HBACK, A LITTLE WIDE RECEIVER. SOLID PASS BLOCKER. &gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THE BACKFIELD NOW ON FIRST DOWN FROM THE 24YARD LINE. VINNY GOING TO THE END ZONE. AND IT'S KNOCKED AWAY BY PATRICK SURTAIN. WHAT A PLAY. DEDRIC WARD THE INTENDED RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; SURTAIN AND MADISON AT THE CORNERS, MAN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THROW AGAINST CORNERS THIS GOOD, YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE BALL OUT IN FRONT AND MAKE YOUR RECEIVER ALMOST HAVE TO DIVE FOR THE BALL. SURTAIN HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE RECEIVERS AS WELL AS MADISON, ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT LOOK AT THE MAKEUP SPEED HERE. HE GETS HIS LEFT HAND OUT JUST IN TIME TO KNOCK IT AWAY FROM WARD. BUT VINNY'S JUST GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXACT. THROW THE BALL SIX INCHES TO A FOOT FURTHER. &gt;&gt; IN A BRUTAL GAME, THE DELICACY OF THAT GESTURE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAVORED. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10. AND THE PASS IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE FLAT AT THE 26YARD LINE BY COLES, WHO GETS SURROUNDED BY DOLPHINS. LED BY ROBERT JONES. THIRD DOWN COMING UP. BIG ONE. THEY JUST THREW ONE THERE FOR 1. IT'S THIRD DOWN AND 11 AT THE 25YARD LINE. VINNY PROTECTED WELL. THROWS. HE HAD A WIDEOPEN RECEIVER, BUT IT'S BRIAN WALKER WHO INTERCEPTS IT! COLES WAS SLANTING TOWARD THE POST. HE THREW IT OUTSIDE, AND THE DOLPHINS STYMIE THE JETS. THIRD PICK FOR MIAMI. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORST PASS OF THE NIGHT FOR TESTAVERDE. LOOKS LIKE IT SLIPPED OUT OF HIS HAND, AS HE JUST WAY AIRMAILS THIS PASS. &gt;&gt; AND VINNY WITH HIS THIRD PICK OF THE NIGHT. AS FIEDLER HANDS THE BALL ON FIRST DOWN TO LAMAR SMITH. UP TO THE 20YARD LINE. IT'S ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN VINNY'S JET CAREER HE'S THROWN MORE THAN ONE INTERCEPTION. BACKSIDE SCREEN TO LAMAR SMITH. AND THAT WORKS FOR A FIRST DOWN, UP TO THE 32YARD LINE. SO HERE ARE THE DOLPHINS. JAY FIEDLER IN AND OUT OF FOOTBALL, JUST LOOKING FOR A JOB, UNDRAFTED DARTMOUTH GUY TO LAMAR SMITH, WHO'S NOW BECOME THE FEATURE BACK SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE, REALLY NO CHANCE TO SHINE UNTIL NOW. &gt;&gt; AND THE DOLPHINS HAVE BASICALLY A DEPLETED RECEIVING CORPS WITH ALL THE INJURIES TO THEIR WIDE RECEIVERS. BUT THEIR CREATIVE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, CHAN GAILEY, IS GETTING IT DONE. THROWING A SCREEN PASS TO THE GUY YOU JUST FAKED THE RUN TO. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 32YARD LINE. A 100YARD NIGHT ON THE GROUND FOR LAMAR SMITH. HE TRIES TO ADD TO IT AND DOES. GOOD, HARD RUNNING. TACKLED BY JONES. UP TO THE 39YARD LINE. WELL, DAVE WAS A DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR. HE, OF COURSE, IS MORE COMFORTABLE ON THAT SIDE OF THE BALL. ANOTHER GUY HE'S BROUGHT IN IS JIM BATES. WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT GAILEY TONIGHT. BUT HE BROUGHT BATES IN FROM THE COWBOYS TO RUN THE DEFENSE. AND AS WE ALL KNOW, FEWEST POINTS IN THE LEAGUE ALLOWED AND ONLY FOUR TOUCHDOWNS ALLOWED THIS SEASON, COUNTING ONE TONIGHT. SECOND AND 3. SMITH OVER THE TOP TO THE 42. &gt;&gt; WHEN GAILEY WAS THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR IN PITTSBURGH, THE GUY WAS AMAZINGLY UNPREDICTABLE. HE MADE KORDELL STEWART LOOK ALLWORLD, FOR GOD'S SAKES. AND HIS CONFIDENCE IS SO DISSIPATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, YOU FORGET HOW GOOD KORDELL WAS THAT YEAR WITH CHAN. &gt;&gt; YOU FORGET ABOUT GAILEY IN DALLAS. HE ACTUALLY LED HIS TEAM TO THE PLAYOFFS IN EACH OF HIS TWO YEARS, AS THEY MEASURE HERE. AND NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF FOOTBALL HAS A GUY GONE IN, LED HIS TEAM TO A PLAYOFF BERTH IN EACH OF THE FIRST TWO SEASONS, AND GOT CANNED. &gt;&gt; LIKE I SAID, HE GOT WHACKED UNJUSTIFIABLY. &gt;&gt; AND WITH ALL THE COORDINATORS AND OFFENSES THROWING THE BALL ALL OVER THE PLACE, CHAN GAILEY IS A COORDINATOR WHO'S TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THE RUN. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND INCHES FROM THE 42YARD LINE. OUT OF THE "I." FIEDLER WILL DO IT HIMSELF. SOMEBODY LOSES THE HELMET. IT'S A JET. AND MIAMI HAS A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; DENNIS TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER THERE'S FIEDLER WITH MORE YARDAGE THIS YEAR ON THE GROUND THAN MARINO HAD IN HIS CAREER. AND THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THROWN INTO A QUARTET OF DEFENDERS. ORONDE GADSDEN OVER THE MIDDLE, THE INTENDED RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT CHAN GAILEY TOLD ME THE ADVICE THAT HE WAS GONNA GIVE JAY FIEDLER TONIGHT HE'S GOT TO AVOID MENTAL MISTAKES, TURNOVERS, AND SACKS. NO SACKS OR TURNOVERS, BUT HE HAS MADE A COUPLE OF MENTAL ERRORS, THAT THROW THERE BEING HAS MADE A COUPLE OF MENTAL ONE OF THEM. ERRORS, THAT THROW THERE BEING HE'S THROWN A COUPLE IN THIS ONE OF THEM. DRIVE INTO SERIOUS DOUBLE AND HE'S THROWN A COUPLE IN THIS TRIPLETEAMING OF HIS WIDEOUTS. DRIVE INTO SERIOUS DOUBLE AND &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE CHAN'S GOT HIS OWN TRIPLETEAMING OF HIS WIDEOUTS. BOOTH THERE. &gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE CHAN'S GOT HIS OWN YOU USUALLY GO INTO THOSE BOOTHS BOOTH THERE. AND IT'S MORE JAMMED THAN THE YOU USUALLY GO INTO THOSE BOOTHS CLOWN CAR AT THE CIRCUS. AND IT'S MORE JAMMED THAN THE I COULDN'T SEE ANY OTHER COACHES CLOWN CAR AT THE CIRCUS. WITH HIM. I COULDN'T SEE ANY OTHER COACHES &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 AT THE 42. WITH HIM. FIEDLER DEEP. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 AT THE 42. AND IT'S PICKED OFF AT THE FIEDLER DEEP. 15YARD LINE BY MARCUS COLEMAN! AND IT'S PICKED OFF AT THE [ CROWD CHEERING ] 15YARD LINE BY MARCUS COLEMAN! THE JETS DESPERATE FOR A BREAK, [ CROWD CHEERING ] AND THEY GET ONE HERE WITH LESS THE JETS DESPERATE FOR A BREAK, THAN 6 MINUTES LEFT IN THE AND THEY GET ONE HERE WITH LESS THIRD. THAN 6 MINUTES LEFT IN THE &gt;&gt; AND JUST AN OUTSTANDING THIRD. EFFORT BY NUMBER 42, &gt;&gt; AND JUST AN OUTSTANDING MARCUS COLEMAN. EFFORT BY NUMBER 42, HIS FIRST PICK OF THE YEAR. MARCUS COLEMAN. LOOK AT THIS EFFORT AS HE STARES HIS FIRST PICK OF THE YEAR. DOWN THE EYES OF GADSDEN AND LOOK AT THIS EFFORT AS HE STARES THEN OUTLEAPS HIM. DOWN THE EYES OF GADSDEN AND &gt;&gt; THIRD QUARTER, LATE THIRD. THEN OUTLEAPS HIM. VINNY TESTAVERDE ON FIRST DOWN &gt;&gt; THIRD QUARTER, LATE THIRD. FROM THE 12. VINNY TESTAVERDE ON FIRST DOWN GIVES IT TO CURTIS MARTIN. FROM THE 12. TO THE 18YARD LINE. GIVES IT TO CURTIS MARTIN. TACKLED THERE BY ZACH THOMAS. TO THE 18YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; ONE MORE LOOK AT THIS TACKLED THERE BY ZACH THOMAS. INTERCEPTION. &gt;&gt; ONE MORE LOOK AT THIS ORONDE GADSDEN HAS GOT TO DO INTERCEPTION. SOMETHING TO TRY AND CATCH THAT ORONDE GADSDEN HAS GOT TO DO BALL. SOMETHING TO TRY AND CATCH THAT MARCUS COLEMAN GAVE THE EFFORT BALL. THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MARCUS COLEMAN GAVE THE EFFORT RECEIVER GIVE. THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NEVER DID EVEN TRY TO GET UP TO RECEIVER GIVE. GET THE BALL. NEVER DID EVEN TRY TO GET UP TO &gt;&gt; I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T KNOCK GET THE BALL. HIMSELF OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T KNOCK &gt;&gt; HERE WAS GAILEY'S REACTION. HIMSELF OUT THERE. CHAN LOOKING ON. &gt;&gt; HERE WAS GAILEY'S REACTION. THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE CHAN LOOKING ON. DOLPHINS. THE OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR OF THE &gt;&gt; "BALDERDASH!" I THINK I DOLPHINS. CAUGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; "BALDERDASH!" I THINK I &gt;&gt; "SON OF A GUN." CAUGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; "SHUCKS." &gt;&gt; "SON OF A GUN." SECOND AND 4 AT THE 18. &gt;&gt; "SHUCKS." AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY MARTIN. SECOND AND 4 AT THE 18. AND HE'S IN BOUNDS. FIRST DOWN. AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY MARTIN. CURTIS STEPPING OUT AT THE AND HE'S IN BOUNDS. FIRST DOWN. 26YARD LINE. CURTIS STEPPING OUT AT THE &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD IS CURTIS MARTIN? 26YARD LINE. LINING UP AS A WIDE RECEIVER AND &gt;&gt; HOW GOOD IS CURTIS MARTIN? RUNNING AN OUT ROUTE AGAINST LINING UP AS A WIDE RECEIVER AND BROCK MARION. RUNNING AN OUT ROUTE AGAINST PROTECTION IS REAL GOOD FOR BROCK MARION. TESTAVERDE. PROTECTION IS REAL GOOD FOR HE'S GOT A GOOD THROWING LANE. TESTAVERDE. AND A GREAT PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. HE'S GOT A GOOD THROWING LANE. MARION CAN'T MAKE A PLAY ON THE AND A GREAT PASS TO THE OUTSIDE. BALL. MARION CAN'T MAKE A PLAY ON THE &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MARTIN, EVERY TIME BALL. YOU SEE HIM, SUCH A SOLID PRO ON &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MARTIN, EVERY TIME SO MANY LEVELS. YOU SEE HIM, SUCH A SOLID PRO ON YOU WONDER HOW THE HECK HE EVER SO MANY LEVELS. GOT OUT OF NEW ENGLAND. YOU WONDER HOW THE HECK HE EVER &gt;&gt; MONEY. GOT OUT OF NEW ENGLAND. FIRST AND 10 AT THE 26YARD &gt;&gt; MONEY. LINE. FIRST AND 10 AT THE 26YARD ANDERSON TO THE 29YARD LINE. LINE. &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S THAT SIMPLE IN ANDERSON TO THE 29YARD LINE. THE END, AL, BUT GREAT PLAYER. &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S THAT SIMPLE IN &gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S THE JOHNNIE RAY THE END, AL, BUT GREAT PLAYER. OF THE NUMBERONE ALBUM. &gt;&gt; I THINK HE'S THE JOHNNIE RAY SECOND AND 7 FROM THE 29. OF THE NUMBERONE ALBUM. CHUGGING STRAIGHT AHEAD IS SECOND AND 7 FROM THE 29. MARTIN. CHUGGING STRAIGHT AHEAD IS I'M SURE THE PATRIOTS TALKING MARTIN. ABOUT MARTIN OF COURSE THEY I'M SURE THE PATRIOTS TALKING LOOK BACK NOW AND KNOW, "YEAH, ABOUT MARTIN OF COURSE THEY CURTIS WOULD LOOK GREAT IN A LOOK BACK NOW AND KNOW, "YEAH, PATRIOT UNIFORM." CURTIS WOULD LOOK GREAT IN A THIRD DOWN AND 3 FROM THE PATRIOT UNIFORM." 32YARD LINE. THIRD DOWN AND 3 FROM THE ANDERSON MAKES THE CATCH AND 32YARD LINE. TRIES TO GET THE FIRST DOWN. ANDERSON MAKES THE CATCH AND IS VERY, VERY CLOSE. TRIES TO GET THE FIRST DOWN. HE GETS RIDDEN DOWN BY THE IS VERY, VERY CLOSE. LINEBACKER, DERRICK RODGERS UP HE GETS RIDDEN DOWN BY THE AT THE 36YARD LINE. LINEBACKER, DERRICK RODGERS UP SO THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. AT THE 36YARD LINE. NOW THEY'LL STOP IT FOR AN SO THE CLOCK CONTINUES TO RUN. APPARENT MEASUREMENT. NOW THEY'LL STOP IT FOR AN &gt;&gt; JUST 3 MINUTES TO GO HERE IN APPARENT MEASUREMENT. THE THIRD QUARTER, AND THE JETS, &gt;&gt; JUST 3 MINUTES TO GO HERE IN WITH THIS TYPE OF OFFENSE, AWFUL THE THIRD QUARTER, AND THE JETS, SLOW GETTING DOWN THE FIELD. WITH THIS TYPE OF OFFENSE, AWFUL THIS IS A HECK OF A TACKLE BY SLOW GETTING DOWN THE FIELD. RODGERS. THIS IS A HECK OF A TACKLE BY ANDERSON GOES TO TURN UP. RODGERS. BUT INSTEAD OF GOING FORWARD, HE ANDERSON GOES TO TURN UP. KIND OF GOES SIDEWAYS. BUT INSTEAD OF GOING FORWARD, HE AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT A REAL KIND OF GOES SIDEWAYS. BAD MARK BY THE OFFICIALS. AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT A REAL I'M SURE THE JETS WILL THINK BAD MARK BY THE OFFICIALS. THAT. I'M SURE THE JETS WILL THINK BUT IF ANY TEAM IS GONNA GO FOR THAT. IT ON FOURTH DOWN AND GET IT, BUT IF ANY TEAM IS GONNA GO FOR THE JETS ARE. IT ON FOURTH DOWN AND GET IT, A PERFECT 4 FOR 4 ON THE SEASON THE JETS ARE. IN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS. A PERFECT 4 FOR 4 ON THE SEASON &gt;&gt; CURTIS MARTIN ON THIRD AND IN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS. 1 AND FOURTH AND 1 THIS YEAR IS &gt;&gt; CURTIS MARTIN ON THIRD AND 5 FOR 5. 1 AND FOURTH AND 1 THIS YEAR IS THIS WOULD BE VERY, VERY RISKY, 5 FOR 5. WITH 18 MINUTES TO GO AT YOUR THIS WOULD BE VERY, VERY RISKY, OWN 36YARD LINE. WITH 18 MINUTES TO GO AT YOUR THE DOLPHINS RIGHT NOW ARE OWN 36YARD LINE. ALMOST ALREADY WITHIN FIELDGOAL THE DOLPHINS RIGHT NOW ARE RANGE IF THE JETS DON'T CONVERT. ALMOST ALREADY WITHIN FIELDGOAL &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONE THING THE JETS RANGE IF THE JETS DON'T CONVERT. KNOW THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONE THING THE JETS AND THIS GOES BACK TO PARCELLS. HE ALWAYS WENT FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN. IT SEEMED LIKE THEY ALWAYS GOT IT. AND WHEN YOU'RE 4 FOR 4, YOU GOT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN GET IT AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THE JETS HAVE CHALLENGED THE FORWARDPROGRESS SPOT. &gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS A GOOD CHALLENGE. IT APPEARED THAT ANDERSON HAD ABOUT A FOOT, MAYBE TWO FEET MORE THAN HE GOT CREDIT FOR. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE CHALLENGE HERE. I'M GONNA GO WORK ON MY MASTER'S. SEE YOU GUYS IN A BIT. I'M GONNA GO DO SOME MASTER'STHESIS WORK HERE. &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO THE LOO, AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON THE WAY BACK. TAKE A LOOK AT ANDERSON. RODGERS WRAPPING HIM UP. WHERE'S FORWARD PROGRESS? &gt;&gt; RIGHT ABOUT THERE. &gt;&gt; "RIGHT ABOUT THERE" IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE? I CAN'T DO STUFF LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. 'CAUSE I'VE GOT THE TOYS. YOU GOT THE BRAINS. I GOT THE TOYS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT ABOUT THERE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW WELL, WALT COLEMAN ALMOST HAS TO MAKE THIS CALL BY LOOKING AT THE REPLAY. WHEN HE SEES WHERE FORWARD PROGRESS WOULD BE, WHAT DOES HE DO TAKE IT FROM THE MONITOR TO OSTENSIBLY THE POINT ON THE FIELD WHERE HE SEES IT ON THE REPLAY? &gt;&gt; THEY ARE GIVING HIM ABOUT FOUR DIFFERENT LOOKS UPSTAIRS IN THE REPLAY BOOTH. THIS WILL BE A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MATTER OF INCHES HERE. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY IT HAS TO BE BEYOND A REASONABLE SHADOW OF DOUBT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. THE RUNNER'S KNEE WAS DOWN. THE JETS WILL BE CHARGED A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S FOURTH DOWN. AND NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES, DO THEY GO FOR IT? AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT, THEY WILL LINE UP TO GO FOR IT. THEY KEEP THEIR OFFENSE OUT ON THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THEY'D BETTER GO FOR IT NOW, 'CAUSE THEY'VE GOT ONE LESS TIMEOUT TO WORK WITH AT THE END OF THE GAME NOW. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE DOWN BY 16. 3:21 REMAINING IN THE THIRD AFTER WHAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT A 4MINUTE INTERRUPTION IN THE GAME. HERE IS FOURTH AND INCHES. AND THEY GIVE IT TO THE UP BACK, AND I DON'T THINK HE GETS IT! THAT'S ANDERSON. NO. &gt;&gt; NOPE. &gt;&gt; I'D ASK FOR A REPLAY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE SAME PLAY THE JETS RAN EARLIER IN THE GAME ON A THIRD DOWN AND SHORT. ANDERSON PICKED IT UP EASILY. BUT NOT THIS TIME. THE DOLPHINS' FRONT LINE JUST STUFFED ANDERSON, AND THEN THE PURSUIT GOT HIM AS HE TRIED TO BOUNCE IT TO THE OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; THIS 51POINT THING IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT AN ANOMALY. &gt;&gt; LOOK HOW MUCH LOWER THE DOLPHINS ARE THAN THE JETS. THAT'S WHAT WINS ON FOURTH AND SHORT. THE LOW MAN ALWAYS WINS BECAUSE IT STOPS THE HIGH MAN'S MOMENTUM AND ALL HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, TAYLOR AND RODGERS ARE VERY LIGHT. IT GETS LATER IN THE SEASON, SOMETIMES THEY ATROPHY A LITTLE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU, THEY'RE HELLBENT FOR GLORY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; SO NOW THE DOLPHINS, TO GET INTO MARE'S FIELDGOAL RANGE, ONLY NEED ABOUT 4 OR 5 YARDS. AND THAT IS A BUSTED PLAY, AS KONRAD TAKES THE PITCH. FIEDLER LOOKED AROUND. GOOD DOUBLE CLUTCH THAT TIME TO HOLD ON TO THE BALL AND THEN FINALLY GET IT OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WAS A BALK. &gt;&gt; YES, IT WAS. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO THROW THE BALL. &gt;&gt; GOOD THING NOBODY WAS ON BASE. SO THE BALL AT THE 34YARD LINE. IT IS SECOND DOWN AND 8. SMITH. INSIDE THE 30, TO THE 27. THIRD AND SHORT. LET'S GO TO MELISSA. &gt;&gt; WELL, AL, IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEATED SUBWAY SERIES, AL LEITER HAS FOUND TIME TO COME AND TAKE IN SOME FOOTBALL. OBVIOUSLY SHOWING YOUR ALLEGIANCE WITH THE JETS. WHY ARE THE JETS PLAYING SO POORLY? &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA. I SAT UP IN A SUITE LEVEL THE WHOLE TIME, AND I DIDN'T WATCH A WHOLE LOT OF THE GAME. I THINK THE SUITES ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO WATCH THE GAME. SO I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR THE GUYS UPSTAIRS TO FIGURE OUT. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; I GET ENOUGH CRITIQUE. I DON'T WANT TO BE RIPPING ON ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. GOOD ANALYSIS. ENJOY THE NIGHT OFF. THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. &gt;&gt; ONE REASON THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS IS JAY FIEDLER CAN DO THINGS THAT NOBODY THOUGHT HE COULD DO I.E., THAT PLAY. GETTING FREE, AVOIDING THE SACK, FINDING TIME AND HITTING ORONDE GADSDEN FOR A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND GADSDEN DOES A GREAT JOB OF FINDING A WAY OF GETTING OPEN. HE REALLY IS THE ONLY RECEIVER ON THAT SIDE OF THE FIELD. HE CAME BACK TO THE QUARTERBACK AND REALLY BAILED HIM OUT. THE RUNNING ABILITY OF FIEDLER HAS BEEN THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE FOR WANNSTEDT'S TEAM. &gt;&gt; HE'S A DISTANT RELATIVE OF ARTHUR FIEDLER, AND HE LOOKS VERY DEFT WITH THE BATON TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 13YARD LINE. SMITH! LOOK AT LAMAR SMITH! TO THE 2YARD LINE. BREAKING A CHRIS HAYES TACKLE, AND LAMAR SMITH HAS RUN FOR 138 YARDS. HIS SEVENTH YEAR IN THE LEAGUE AND THE FIRST TIME HE HAS PLAYED IN A MONDAYNIGHT GAME. HE IS A PRIMETIME PLAYER. &gt;&gt; WHAT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IS YARDAGE AFTER CONTACT. THERE'S CHRIS HAYES. GONE. STEPS OUT OF THAT TACKLE AND THEN GETS ALL THE WAY DOWN INSIDE THE 5YARD LINE BEFORE A BUNCH OF JETS GET HIM. BUT THAT'S WHAT OFFENSIVE LINEMEN LOVE MAKING THE FIRST GUY MISS OR MAKING THE FIRST GUY PAY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A CURTIS MARTIN RUN RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 3YARD LINE ON FIRST DOWN. THEY GIVE IT TO SMITH. TOUCHDOWN, MIAMI. AND SO THE JETS ATTEMPT TO GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN, DON'T GET IT, AND THE DOLPHINS MAKE THEM PAY A VERY HEAVY PRICE. &gt;&gt; KONRAD IS REALLY LOVING IT, MAN. HE'S BEEN KNOCKING PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR HEELS ALL NIGHT AFTER THAT COMMENT ABOUT HOW HE COULDN'T BLOCK. HE'S BEEN THE LEAD BLOCKER ON ALMOST EVERY BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BLOCK HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG, BUT HE KNOWS HOW TO LEAD THE WAY FOR A GUY LIKE SMITH, WHO HAS NOW CARRIED 19 TIMES FOR 141 YARDS. AND MARE FOR THE POINT AFTER. THE DOLPHINS, WITH 12 TICKS REMAINING IN THE THIRD QUARTER, LEADING THE NEW YORK JETS 307. THEY'VE OUTGAINED THEM 363 YARDS TO 154. DOMINANT BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL. KEVIN WILLIAMS BRINGS IT FROM THE 15 ONLY BACK TO THE 25 AGAINST THIS SWARMING DOLPHINS SPECIAL TEAM. &gt;&gt; LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE GUY THAT CAN'T BLOCK HIS WAY OUT OF A PAPER BAG. HE CAN FIND A SAFETY, THOUGH. VICTOR GREEN, 21, COMES UP. KONRAD PUSHES HIM ALMOST OVER ONTO HIS WALLET. THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOMINATING THE JETS RIGHT NOW. THAT WAS KEVIN DONNALLEY AND TODD WADE, THE ROOKIE FROM MISSISSIPPI, ON THAT RIGHT SIDE, WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO POUND THE BALL. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW KONRAD'S GOT TO BE A GAMER. THEY LET HIM WEAR 44 AT SYRACUSE. THAT'S ALMOST SACRILEGIOUS. &gt;&gt; JETS WITH THOSE THREE WINS THIS SEASON WHEN TRAILING GOING INTO THE FOURTH, BUT NEVER BY THIS MUCH. ANDERSON MAKING THE CATCH. THEY BEAT GREEN BAY ON OPENING DAY, THEY BEAT NEW ENGLAND IN A MONDAYNIGHT GAME AND TAMPA BAY. BUT TOUGHER TIMES AHEAD TONIGHT. FOURTH QUARTER AT THE MEADOWLANDS. AL MICHAELS, DAN FOUTS, DENNIS MILLER, ERIC DICKERSON, AND MELISSA STARK. THE NEW YORK JETS, DOWN BY 23, HAVE A FIRST AND 10 AT THEIR OWN 36. THE OPENING PLAY OF THE LAST QUARTER BEGINS WITH A PENALTY AS ANDERSON MAKES THE CATCH. &gt;&gt; IT HASN'T CHANGED A WHOLE LOT FROM THE FIRST QUARTER, WHEN THE DOLPHINS REALLY CAME OUT AND SET THE TONE. &gt;&gt; VINNY TESTAVERDE. IT'S BEEN THAT KIND OF NIGHT. THE TOUCHDOWN TO CHREBET. THE THREE PICKS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I GET THE LITTLE DOLLARS, DENNIS. &gt;&gt; AH. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 41YARD LINE. AND THAT IS...CAUGHT AT THE 32YARD LINE BY DEDRIC WARD. BRIAN WALKER, WHO'S BEEN HITTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND I THINK HE HIT PATRICK SURTAIN HARDER THAN HE HIT DEDRIC WARD ON THAT PLAY, 'CAUSE SURTAIN IS HOLDING HIS LEFT ARM RIGHT NOW. WHAT A CATCH BY WARD. &gt;&gt; JETS GOING WITHOUT A HUDDLE IN THE FIRST MINUTE OF THE FOURTH QUARTER. TESTAVERDE THROWS. REACHING FOR IT AT THE 24 A FLAG AGAIN. ANDERSON WAS THE INTENDED RECEIVER, AND HE WAS COVERED ON THE PLAY BY GREG JEFFRIES. DEFENSIVE HOLDING IS THE CALL. &gt;&gt; JERRY WILSON GOT THE CALL ON THAT ONE. &gt;&gt; HOLDING, 24. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN AT THE 27YARD LINE. WITH CHREBET IN MOTION, ANDERSON. AND HE GETS TRIPPED UP BY BRIAN WALKER. SO HE'S ALL OVER THE JOINT. THERE'S WALKER COVERING DEEP ON THE LAST PLAY. THEN HE GETS INTO THE BACKFIELD TO KNOCK THE RUNNER DOWN BEHIND THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GONNA RUN THAT OPTION PLAY AGAIN. NOW THEY'VE GOT TO GO TO THE HURRYUP OFFENSE. TIME RUNNING DOWN. THE CLOCK'S STILL MOVING. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 13. VINNY. FOR COLES. AND DOES HE MAKE THE CATCH? HE DOES! HOW DID HE CATCH THAT ONE? &gt;&gt; SAME WAY HE DROPPED THAT HOW DID HE CATCH THAT ONE? EARLIER ONE. &gt;&gt; SAME WAY HE DROPPED THAT &gt;&gt; SAM MADISON HAD IT! EARLIER ONE. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT OUT OF &gt;&gt; SAM MADISON HAD IT! SAM MADISON'S GRASP. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT OUT OF IT WENT FROM AN INTERCEPTION TO SAM MADISON'S GRASP. A COMPLETION AND A TOUCHDOWN. IT WENT FROM AN INTERCEPTION TO &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION, AL. A COMPLETION AND A TOUCHDOWN. THE BALL WAS RIGHT IN MADISON'S &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION, AL. HANDS. THE BALL WAS RIGHT IN MADISON'S HE JUGGLED IT, AND COLES HANDS. SNATCHED IT FROM HIM. HE JUGGLED IT, AND COLES LOOK AT THIS. SNATCHED IT FROM HIM. THE FIRST HANDS YOU'LL SEE WILL LOOK AT THIS. BE MADISON'S. THAT'S WHY SOME GUYS PLAY DEFENSE AND SOME GUYS PLAY OFFENSE. &gt;&gt; HEADS UP FOR THE KID. GOOD FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; GREAT PLAY BY LAVERANUES COLES. WHAT A GIFT, THOUGH. THROWN OVER THE OUTSIDE SHOULDER. &gt;&gt; WOULD'VE NEVER GOT THAT BALL HAD MADISON NOT HELD IT UP FOR HIM. IT WAS WAY OUT OF REACH. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S 3013. THEY'RE GONNA GO FOR 2, WHICH I FIND TO BE SOMEWHAT CURIOUS TO BEGIN WITH. AND... THEY DO NOT MAKE IT. JETS SCORING THE TOUCHDOWN BUT OPTING TO GO FOR 2 IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU NORMALLY DEFER THAT CHOICE UNTIL YOU REALLY NEED THE 2POINT CONVERSION. SO NOW TWO TOUCHDOWNS AND TWO 2POINTERS STILL DON'T GET THEM EVEN. HERE'S MARION BRINGING IT BACK OUT TO THE 32YARD LINE. ON FIRST DOWN, J.J. JOHNSON GETS THE CARRY. HE IS A KID OUT OF MISSISSIPPI STATE. PICKED IN THE SECOND ROUND LAST YEAR BY JIMMY JOHNSON AND WAS BEING COUNTED ON AS A GUY WHO COULD DO A LOT OF THINGS FOR THEM. ANOTHER LOOK AT THE TOUCHDOWN HERE. &gt;&gt; LAVERANUES COLES OUGHT TO HAVE SOMEBODY BACK HOME SET THE VCR FOR THAT ONE, BECAUSE THAT'S HIS FIRST PROFESSIONAL TOUCHDOWN. AND IT'S A GIFT COMPLIMENTS OF SAM MADISON. &gt;&gt; I'M SURPRISED SAMMY DIDN'T JUST BAT THAT DOWN. HE'S SUCH A SAVVY PLAYER, AND HE KNEW THE KID WAS RIGHT ON HIS SHOULDER. HE SHOULD'VE JUST SPIKED IT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS J.J. JOHNSON AGAIN. SO LAMAR SMITH HAS BEEN THE WORKHORSE TONIGHT. HE'S CARRIED FOR 141 YARDS. JOHNSON HAS PLAYED VERY SPARINGLY THIS SEASON. ONE GAME HE WAS INACTIVE. ANOTHER GAME HE DIDN'T PLAY AT ALL, AND HE'S ONLY CARRIED THE BALL A TOTAL OF 10 TIMES COMING INTO TONIGHT'S ACTION. THERE'S SMITH GETTING A WELLDESERVED BREATHER. AND IF J.J. JOHNSON CAN COME OFF THE BENCH AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE OF PACE, JUST ANOTHER LAYER ADDED TO THIS OFFENSE BY WANNSTEDT AND GAILEY. &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT BALANCE ON OFFENSE. THE DOLPHINS HAVE 182 YARDS RUSHING AND 187 PASSING. &gt;&gt; NOW THURMAN THOMAS IS IN THE GAME ON THIRD DOWN, OUT OF THE SHOTGUN. THIRD AND 4. [ CROWD CHEERING ] AND THAT IS BATTED IN THE AIR AND ALMOST INTERCEPTED! SHAUN ELLIS BATTED IT, AND THEN FIEDLER GOT BACK THERE TO MAKE SURE ELLIS DIDN'T INTERCEPT IT AND WALTZ INTO THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RIGHT, AL. IT LOOKED LIKE IF FIEDLER DOESN'T GET IN ELLIS' WAY, ELLIS IS GONNA MAKE THIS CATCH. PRETTY GOOD ATHLETIC ABILITY FOR THE ROOKIE. WATCH HIM GET UP IN THE AIR WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND THEN CHASE THE BALL DOWN. FIEDLER KNEW HE WAS IN TROUBLE THERE. AND JUST GOT A RIGHT ARM IN THERE TO KEEP ELLIS FROM PICKING IT OFF. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE BO ELLIS FOR THE OLD MARQUETTE WARRIORS THERE. &gt;&gt; SHAUN ELLIS, THE FIRST OF THE JETS' FOUR FIRSTROUND PICKS. NO PUNT. WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP. WALT COLEMAN. BUSY NIGHT FOR WALT. &gt;&gt; PRIOR TO THE SNAP, FALSE START, 28, OFFENSE. 5 YARDS. STILL FOURTH DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RAY HILL, AND HE'S THE GUNNER ON THE FAR OUTSIDE. HE JUST FLINCHED A LITTLE BIT, AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO GET THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT ONE YEAR AL McGUIRE LET BO DESIGN THE UNIFORMS? HOW COOL WAS AL McGUIRE? THE MOST OPENMINDED COACH OF A MAJOR SPORT TEAM EVER. &gt;&gt; THINKING ABOUT AL McGUIRE. TOUGH TIMES FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. DEDRIC WARD BACK TO RECEIVE TURK'S PUNT. WARD AT THE 30YARD LINE. AND DEDRIC BRINGS IT BACK UP TO THE 37YARD LINE. SO THE JETS WILL TAKE OVER THERE WITH 12:02 REMAINING IN THE FOURTH PERIOD. &gt;&gt; 12:02. EVERYBODY STAY FROSTY. LET'S GET THIS PUPPY INTO THE BARN. &gt;&gt; VINNY 173 AS A STARTER FOR THE JETS COMING IN TONIGHT BUT DOWN BY 17. ON FIRST DOWN, THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. IN THE DIRECTION OF WAYNE CHREBET. &gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T SEEN VINNY LOOK LIKE THIS SINCE TAMPA BAY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GIVE THE DOLPHINS A LOT OF CREDIT, BECAUSE COMING INTO THE GAME WITH THEIR DEFENSE, THE ABILITY TO GET PRESSURE ON HIM WITH JUST FOUR GUYS THERE'S JUST NOT A WHOLE LOT OF HOLES IN THIS SECONDARY FOR HIM TO PUT THE BALL. PLUS YOU ADD THE FACT THAT HE'S HAVING AN OFF NIGHT AND YOU GET THIS TYPE OF STATISTICAL MATCH FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; HE JUST LOOKS A LITTLE LOST, THOUGH. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A WHILE. I'VE SEEN BAD GAMES, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM LOOK LOST AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 10. CAUGHT BY ANDERSON. TO THE 42YARD LINE. DAN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT DOLPHIN DEFENSE. AND THEY HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. AND THERE IT IS. JIM BATES CAME OVER FROM DALLAS. KIND OF AN UNHERALDED ASSISTANT. BUT HE HAS DONE A MASTERFUL JOB WITH THIS UNIT. THIRD DOWN AND 5. AND THAT PASS IS INCOMPLETE. FLAG IS THROWN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BATES, AL. WHAT ROLE DID HE SERVE IN DALLAS? &gt;&gt; WELL, HE WAS THE LINEBACKERS COACH, AND HE WAS THE DEFENSIVE LINE COACH FOR A WHILE UNDER BARRY SWITZER AND GAILEY. AND THEN WANNSTEDT HAS KNOWN JIM THROUGH THE YEARS. VINNY VERY MUCH OFF THE MARK TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND PERHAPS THAT'S THE REASON WHY THAT BALL WAS OFF THE MARK. TRYING TO GET IT TO RICHIE ANDERSON. &gt;&gt; ILLEGAL CONTACT. 59, DEFENSE. 5 YARDS. AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; DERRICK RODGERS. &gt;&gt; IS LUCAS JUST SO FAR OUT OF THE LOOP HE'S NEVER GONNA SEE ANY ACTION? &gt;&gt; GROH DID PULL VINNY AGAINST TAMPA BAY FOR A SERIES, AND VINNY CAME BACK IN AND PLAYED EXTREMELY WELL. LED THE JETS TO THAT UPSET WIN AT THE TIME. &gt;&gt; LUCAS PLAYED ALMOST THE WHOLE PITTSBURGH GAME AND LAID AN EGG THAT DAY. FIRST AND 10 FROM THE 47YARD LINE. TESTAVERDE HITS ANDERSON AT THE 48YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT LUCAS, THOUGH, IS HE HAS PLAYED WELL AGAINST MIAMI TWO WINS LAST YEAR WHERE HE THREW FIVE TOUCHDOWN PASSES AND ZERO ZERO INTERCEPTIONS. &gt;&gt; IN ADDITION TO A GREAT SCHEME, THE DOLPHIN D REALLY TAKES THEIR POUND OF FLESH. THEY HIT. &gt;&gt; AND THERE GOES VINNY. HE'S GONNA TAKE OFF. &gt;&gt; GET DOWN. &gt;&gt; GETS THE FIRST DOWN. TRIES TO GET TO THE SIDELINE AND CAN'T. AND THE DOLPHINS WRAP HIM UP IN BOUNDS TO KEEP THE CLOCK ROLLING. BRIAN WALKER IS THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KIND OF NIGHT IT'S BEEN FOR TESTAVERDE. HERE HE MAKES A GREAT PLAY TO PICK UP A FIRST DOWN, BUT HE DOESN'T GO OUT OF BOUNDS. HE'S FIGHTING FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IN THE END ZONE HERE. YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST STEP ON OUT OF BOUNDS. &gt;&gt; HERE'S VINNY THROWING. A LITTLE BEHIND CHREBET, BUT HE MAKES THE CATCH. AND CHREBET TAKES IT INSIDE THE 20, TO THE 18YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; CHREBET IS REALLY THEIR ONLY PLAYMAKER AS A RECEIVER. AND HE HAS SUCH MAGIC. WATCH THIS MOVE AFTER THE CATCH. THIS IS WHAT FIRST OF ALL, LOOK AT THE CATCH. RIGHT THERE HE SENDS BRIAN WALKER DOWN WITH A GREAT MOVE. &gt;&gt; NOW ON FIRST DOWN, A FLAG IS THROWN AGAIN. ANOTHER PENALTY. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. HIT THE GROUND. PENALTYFILLED GAME. 12 HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S 12 MEN ON THE FIELD AGAINST MIAMI. &gt;&gt; WE GET THAT EVERY WEEK. &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT SURE THAT HOW'D YOU GET DOWN TO THE FIELD, DENNIS? &gt;&gt; 12 MEN ON THE FIELD, DEFENSE. 5 YARDS. REPEAT FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; I GUESS THAT'S A PENALTY YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE OF IN THE NEW FOOTBALL, WITH SO MANY ROTATIONS INSIDE AND OUT. I GUESS THEY DON'T QUITE KNOW WHO THEY HAVE ON THE FIELD AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE SEE ONE OF THOSE A WEEK. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; IT USUALLY HAPPENS IN PREVENT SITUATIONS, WHERE A LOT OF SUBSTITUTIONS ARE GOING ON AGAINST A HURRYUP OFFENSE LIKE THE JETS ARE RUNNING NOW. &gt;&gt; DAVE WANNSTEDT SCREAMING AT THE LINE JUDGE. OBVIOUSLY HE FELT THEY DIDN'T HAVE 12 GUYS ON THE FIELD, THAT SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN OFF. TESTAVERDE THROWING OVER THE MIDDLE. IT IS CAUGHT AT THE 1YARD LINE. AND IN FOR THE TOUCHDOWN IS RICHIE ANDERSON! [ CROWD CHEERING ] NOW, WHAT IF THEY HADN'T GONE FOR THE 2, AL? WHAT WOULD WE BE LOOKING AT HERE? THEY'D HAVE 20 AT THIS MOMENT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO FOR 1, YOU WOULD'VE BEEN DOWN BY 16 INSTEAD OF 17 AT THIS POINT. THEN YOU GO FOR 2. &gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT RICHIE ANDERSON'S VERSATILITY. I'M NOT SO SURE HE WAS IN THE END ZONE BEFORE HIS KNEES WENT DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND NOW WANNSTEDT THROWS THE FLAG, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOOKED AT IT UPSTAIRS, AND HE GETS THE MESSAGE FROM THE BOOTH AND SAYS, "LET'S CHALLENGE THIS." THIS GAME IS LASTING AS LONG AS A BASEBALL GAME. &gt;&gt; HEAVEN FORBID. &gt;&gt; OH, HEAVEN FORBID THAT WANNSTEDT HIT AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN IN THE EYE WITH THAT FLAG WHEN HE THROWS IT. THAT'LL BE THE NEXT ODD SCENARIO IN THE LEAGUE. &gt;&gt; MIAMI HAS CHALLENGED THE RULING ON THE FIELD THAT IT IS A TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; IT LOOKED LIKE ANDERSON'S KNEES MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED DOWN BEFORE HE EXTENDED THE BALL OVER THE GOAL LINE. YOU GOT TO LOVE THIS EFFORT. GREAT CATCH THERE. LOOKED LIKE THAT LEFT KNEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A WHOLE NEW DEMAND PUT ON THE ASSISTANT COACHES UP TOP. THEY'VE GOT TO KEEP THEIR EYES PEELED, QUICKLY LET THE HEAD COACH KNOW THAT THEY THINK THERE'S A CHALLENGE THERE, AND GET IT DOWN TO THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS EVEN IF YOU WIN THE CHALLENGE, THE BALL IS GONNA BE AT ABOUT THE 2INCH LINE, FIRST AND GOAL. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S GONNA BE AT ABOUT MAYBE THE 6INCH LINE OR SO, AL. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, IT'S WORTH A CHALLENGE AT THIS POINT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT, BUT IT KIND OF DOES DELAY THE INEVITABLE. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE JETS WOULD BE ABLE TO PUSH IT IN. THERE HIS KNEE IS DOWN, AND CLEARLY THE BALL IS MAYBE EVEN AS MUCH AS A YARD FROM BEING IN THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE RUNNER'S KNEE WAS DOWN AT THE 1YARD LINE. THE BALL WAS AT THE 1YARD LINE. IT'LL BE FIRST AND GOAL AT THE 1. MIAMI IS NOT CHARGED A TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN UPHELD. WALT COLEMAN TELLING THE CROWD THAT THE RUNNER WAS DOWN AT THE 1YARD LINE. SO IT IS FIRST DOWN AND GOAL WITH 10:01 LEFT IN REGULATION. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE ONE TIME WE CUT AWAY FOR A MANDATED COMMERCIAL, THEY WRAP IT UP QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; HERE IS TESTAVERDE OFF THE PLAY FAKE. AND HE WILL TOSS INTO THE END ZONE. CAUGHT. TOUCHDOWN. JERMAINE WIGGINS. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF TIME LEFT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WIGGINS' SECOND CATCH OF THE YEAR AND HIS FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF HIS CAREER. SO WE'VE GOT COLES OFF THE SCHNEID AND NOW WIGGINS. REALLY A FINE ROUTE THERE UNDERNEATH. AND TESTAVERDE BEING VERY PATIENT, FINDING HIM. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] &gt;&gt; AND NOW THE JETS FOR THE EXTRA POINT TO TRY TO PULL THEM WITHIN 10. AND THAT IS GOOD. THE JETS, 63 YARDS. WIGGINS, THE 1YARD TOUCHDOWN CATCH. BROCK MARION BACK TO RECEIVE THE KICK. AND WITH NEW YORK DOWN BY 10, HALL'S KICK IS FIELDED AT THE 10YARD LINE BY MARION. OUT PAST THE 20. THE 30. AND HE BRINGS IT BACK TO THE 34YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE CROWD HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF, AL. BUT THOSE WHO STAYED ARE REINVIGORATED. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY'VE GOT TO LIKE THIS GAME PLANNING BY DAN HENNING. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PLAY CALL BY HENNING, BECAUSE HE FINDS THE YOUNG TIGHT END RIGHT HERE, GUARDED BY TRACE ARMSTRONG, NUMBER 93. WATCH WIGGINS CUT ACROSS THE MIDDLE. ARMSTRONG GOES DOWN. AND NOW HE'S TOO LATE TO MAKE A PLAY ON THE BALL. GREAT CALL BY HENNING. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN FOR THE DOLPHINS AT THE 35YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; THERE WE GO. &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGIN ON THE GROUND WITH LAMAR SMITH GOING NEXT TO NOWHERE. SO THE CROWD IS REINVIGORATED, THE JET DEFENSE IS REINVIGORATED, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT LOOKED TO BE A WALK IN THE PARK FOR DAVE WANNSTEDT IS ANYTHING BUT. &gt;&gt; THE ONE THING TESTAVERDE TOLD ME THIS WEEK IS THIS TEAM HAS SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THEIR DEFENSE TO KEEP THINGS CLOSE. WELL, THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY DO THAT TONIGHT, BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO HANG IN THERE. AND HE PLAYS BETTER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WHEN THE PRESSURE'S ON THE MOST. HE HAS TURNED HIS GAME AROUND. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 FROM THE 35YARD LINE. [ CROWD CHEERING ] SMITH AGAIN. GAINS 2, AND IT'LL SET UP A THIRD AND 7. MET FIRST BY MARVIN JONES. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING THOSE TWO PLAYS DID WAS TAKE ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF OFF THE CLOCK. FIEDLER LOOKING PUZZLED AT THOSE TWO CALLS. A COUPLE OF DIVES RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE JET DEFENSE. THE CLOCK IS STILL ROLLING, BUT THE JETS HAVE MOMENTUM. &gt;&gt; WHO'D HAVE THUNK IT THAT WE'D HAVE A GAME? I GUESS IT ALL TURNED ON THAT LAVERANUES COLES TOUCHDOWN CATCH, HUH? &gt;&gt; THAT WAS PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; OUT OF THE SHOTGUN. THEY HAVE TO GET TO THE 45 TO CONVERT. INSIDE HANDOFF. THOMAS STOPPED WELL SHY OF THE FIRST, AND SO IT'S THREE AND OUT. &gt;&gt; A LACK OF CONFIDENCE SHOWN IN THIS PASSING OFFENSE. REMEMBER, BERT EMANUEL IS OUT OF THE GAME. HE'S THEIR NICKEL RECEIVER. SO THE DOLPHINS ELECT JUST TO RUN SOME TIME OFF THE CLOCK AND KICK IT BACK TO THE JETS. &gt;&gt; MATT TURK WILL PUNT. DEDRIC WARD BACK TO RECEIVE IT. AND NOW IT'S EVEN THE LITTLE THINGS. IT'S FAIRCAUGHT AT THE 18. IT LOOKED AS IF MIAMI WOULD BE WALTZING HOME INTO THE NIGHT 61. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEIR LEAD IS NOW 10. THE JETS HAVE 7 1/2 MINUTES REMAINING, AND THEY HAVE A FIRST DOWN AT THEIR OWN 19YARD LINE. TESTAVERDE OVER THE MIDDLE. THAT'S CAUGHT BY COLES. A FLAG COMES IN BECAUSE TESTAVERDE GOT WHACKED AT THE END OF THE PLAY. AND ANOTHER FLAG COMES OUT AND A THIRD ONE. SO YOU HAVE A FLAG DOWN BEHIND TESTAVERDE AND TWO ON THE SIDELINE AT THE END OF THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; VINNY GOT WHACKED PRETTY GOOD. THAT GOT THE FIRST PENALTY. HERE IS COLES WORKING AGAINST SAM MADISON, WHO DROPS OFF HIS COVERAGE FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. MUST HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD HELP ON THE INSIDE. LOOK AT COLES STRUGGLE. HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD HIGH SCHOOL RUNNING BACK. JERRY WILSON'S GONNA GET THAT FLAG FOR KNOCKING HIM OUT OF BOUNDS. HERE'S THE FIRST ONE. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL FOUL. ROUGHING THE QUARTERBACK, NUMBER 83 OF THE DEFENSE. THAT PENALTY IS DECLINED. PERSONAL FOUL. UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, NUMBER 24, DEFENSE. THAT PENALTY WILL BE ACCEPTED. 15 YARDS. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; BOY, THE DOLPHINS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THE JETS GET BACK IN THIS GAME. &gt;&gt; I GUESS VINNY REALLY DOES FEEL HE HAS TO HAVE HIS BACK TO THE WALL. &gt;&gt; ARMSTRONG A LITTLE FRUSTRATED TONIGHT. HE LETS VINNY HAVE IT WAY TOO LATE. YOU CAN SEE HOW GUILTY HE WAS. TRYING TO KEEP VINNY STANDING. &gt;&gt; TO THE 44YARD LINE. TONIGHT THE DOLPHINS HAVE GIVEN UP AS MANY TOUCHDOWNS IN THIS GAME AS THEY HAD IN SIX GAMES CUMULATIVELY COMING IN. &gt;&gt; TOLD YOU ABOUT VINNY BEING A FOURTHQUARTER QUARTERBACK. &gt;&gt; AND THE JETS WITH THREE FOURTHQUARTER COMEFROMBEHIND WINS THIS SEASON. THAT IS CAUGHT BY COLES, AND IT'S A GOOD OPENFIELD TACKLE BY BRIAN WALKER. ALL OVER THE JOINT TONIGHT. THE JETS HAVE BEEN GOING WITHOUT A HUDDLE SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER BEGAN. SECOND DOWN AND 6. FROM THE 40. VINNY. OUT PATTERN. CAUGHT. WARD. OUT OF BOUNDS, 33. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS, IT'S BETTER FOR VINNY TO HAVE THE NOHUDDLE. HE HAS LESS TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT, MORE TIME JUST TO GO ON IMPULSE POWER. &gt;&gt; AND THE DOLPHINS HAVE LOST ALL THEIR AGGRESSION ON DEFENSE. THEIR BUMPANDRUN HAS TOTALLY DISAPPEARED. THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE RECEIVERS AND THROWING THEM OFF THEIR PATTERNS. THEY'RE NOT GUARDING THEM AT ALL. &gt;&gt; THEY LOST THEIR AGGRESSION ON OFFENSE, TOO. I LOOKED DOWN AT FIEDLER'S STATS. HE'S 12 FOR 24 FOR 187. HE HAD THAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER ALMOST. THEY GOT A LITTLE TOO CONSERVATIVE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 33YARD LINE. VINNY THROWING. CAUGHT AT THE 23YARD LINE. BUT NO. OUT OF BOUNDS BECAUSE HE WAS JUGGLING. IT'S COLES. HAD HE HAD POSSESSION, HE HAD BOTH FEET IN. BUT HE DIDN'T. JUGGLES. INCOMPLETE. &gt;&gt; HE RAN ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD. HERE'S COLES. VINNY IS ON THE RUN AS WELL. THAT'S A GREAT CALL BY THE OFFICIALS. IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO LOOK DOWN TO SEE WHERE HE WAS AS HE KNEW HE WAS GETTING CLOSE TO THE SIDELINE. &gt;&gt; I THINK HALFWAY ACROSS HE WAS CHECKING ON CROSSING TRAFFIC, TOO. HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET CUT IN HALF. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 10 FROM THE 33YARD LINE. VINNY FOR WARD. INCOMPLETE. REACHING UP WAS PATRICK SURTAIN WITH THE COVERAGE. THIRD DOWN AND 10. THIRD DOWN AND 10 AT THE 33. AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY CHREBET! RIGHT OVER THE MIDDLE GOES WAYNE, TO THE 18YARD LINE. ANOTHER JET FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; AS BAD AS VINNY TESTAVERDE PLAYED FOR THREE QUARTERS TONIGHT AND HE PLAYED HORRIBLY HE IS PLAYING JUST THE OPPOSITE. HE'S MAGNIFICENT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; IT STARTED AT MIDNIGHT. LIKE TUESDAY MORNING INSTEAD OF MONDAY NIGHT. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 17. VINNY THROWS. AND FALLING DOWN, BECAUSE HE WOULD'VE HAD IT, WAS CURTIS MARTIN. HE JUST SLIPPED. &gt;&gt; BOY, AND HE GOT THE BALL RIGHT IN THE FACE, TOO. TESTAVERDE ON TARGET. AGAIN A LITTLE BIT BEHIND MARTIN. THAT'S WHY HE SLIPPED. GO BACK TO THE WAYNE CHREBET CATCH. WHAT A TOUGH GUY OVER THE MIDDLE. THIS IS REALLY WHERE YOU EARN RESPECT FROM YOUR TEAMMATES AND FROM PLAYERS AROUND THE LEAGUE. MAKING THE CATCH, TAKING THE HIT. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 FROM THE 17. VINNY. TO THE END ZONE. IS IT CAUGHT? IT IS CAUGHT AT THE 1/2YARD LINE. ONE OFFICIAL CHECKS WITH THE OTHER THEN SAYS NO! THE FIELD JUDGE IS BEHIND MARTIN. MARION WITH THE COVERAGE. AND THE FIELD JUDGE CLOSEST TO THE PLAY HAD TO LOOK ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE FIELD TO GET THE INCOMPLETE SIGN. &gt;&gt; THIS ONE MAY BE WORTH A CHALLENGE. THAT'S A CATCH. IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH TO HIS ELBOWS. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. AT FIRST LOOK, HE HAD BOTH HANDS UNDER THAT BALL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TOUGH. FROM THAT ANGLE, YOU CAN'T OVERTURN THAT. THAT'S A CATCH. NO. HE CALLED IT NO CATCH. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED IT NO CATCH. &gt;&gt; BUT, AL, YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN, THE MAN THAT MADE THE CALL WAS A GOOD 40 YARDS AWAY. &gt;&gt; THE REFEREE OR THE OFFICIAL BEHIND HIM DOESN'T HAVE A VIEW OF IT, BECAUSE THERE HE IS, LOOKING. AND THEN HE'S LOOKING ACROSS THE FIELD TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER OFFICIAL HAS TO SAY. WITH THAT INDICATION, HE ALMOST INDICATES THE PASS WAS CAUGHT. PUTTING HIS LEFT HAND UP IN THE AIR. ARE THEY GOING TO CHALLENGE IS THE QUESTION. &gt;&gt; AND THE ANSWER IS YES. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT IS A VERY TOUGH CALL, BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THE BALL BEGINNING TO COME OUT OF HIS GRASP. THE FIELD JUDGE IS WAITING FOR I BELIEVE IT'S THE LINE JUDGE OR THE SIDE JUDGE I COULDN'T TELL TO COME IN AND MAKE THE CALL COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE. SO HERE GOES WALT COLEMAN NOW TO DETERMINE, POSSIBLY, THE FATE OF THIS GAME. &gt;&gt; WELL, I FIGURE IF THE GUY WAS SO INTENT ON MAKING HIS CALL THAT HE SLIPPED AND FELL ON HIS TUKHUS LIKE THAT, HE MUST HAVE SAW SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; MM. OH. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE THE BALL WAS LOOSE THERE. BUT THAT SIGNAL THERE SIGNIFIES THAT IT IS A CATCH. AND HE IS OVERRULED. &gt;&gt; HE'S OVERRULED BY THE OTHER OFFICIAL COMING IN, MEANING ON THE CHALLENGE THEY HAVE TO SEE INDISPUTABLE VISUAL EVIDENCE THAT IT IS A CATCH. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER THING THAT OFFICIAL DIDN'T SEE WAS BROCK MARION HOLDING CURTIS MARTIN. HE HAD AHOLD OF HIS RIGHT ARM THERE. &gt;&gt; WELL, THE OFFICIAL WHO MADE THE CALL CATCH OBVIOUSLY DID WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE. HE WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED OUT. HE HAD TO MAKE THAT CALL. THAT'S ALL HE COULD SEE. &gt;&gt; HE IS SIGNALING &gt;&gt; NO, THAT'S A CALL. &gt;&gt; THE CALL IS THAT THAT IS WHERE MARTIN HAS BEEN STOPPED. HE SEES THE BALL AT THAT POINT. BUT THEN THE OTHER OFFICIAL COMES SLIDING IN AND SAID, "I HAD A BETTER ANGLE, AND HE DID NOT MAKE THE CATCH." ONCE AGAIN, THE FIELD JUDGE, WHO CAN BE OVERRULED BY ANOTHER OFFICIAL WHO SAID, "I HAD A BETTER VIEW." AND THERE HE IS LOOKING AT THE OTHER OFFICIAL, WHO SAID, "I HAD A BETTER VIEW OF THIS. THE CATCH WAS NOT MADE." &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DIDN'T SEE THE PASS INTERFERENCE, THOUGH. HE'S STANDING ABOUT SIX FEET AWAY FROM MARION AND CURTIS MARTIN. SAFE! &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE UMPIRE, ACTUALLY, UNDREY WASH, WHO COMES IN AND MAKES THE CALL. THE FIELD JUDGE... &gt;&gt; THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. &gt;&gt; ...IS SCOTT STEENSON. NOW WALT COLEMAN IS THE MAN OF THIS VERY LATE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. THE BALL WENT THROUGH THE RECEIVER'S ARMS AND HIT THE GROUND. THE JETS ARE CHARGED WITH A TEAM TIMEOUT. [ CROWD BOOING ] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NOW LOST TWO TIMEOUTS ON CHALLENGES, AND THEY ARE DOWN TO ONE. A 3 1/2MINUTE INTERRUPTION OF THE GAME. I AGREE WITH IT, DAN. I DIDN'T SEE EVIDENCE TO OVERTURN THE INCOMPLETE CALL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. MARTIN'S BACK WAS TO THE OFFICIAL. IT APPEARED AT FIRST HE HAD BOTH HANDS UNDER IT, BUT HIS HANDS DID NOT STOP THE BALL. IT WENT BETWEEN HIS ELBOWS AND HIT THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY FROM THAT ONE ANGLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE FIELD RIGHT ON THE SIDE, IT DID LOOK LIKE IT COULD'VE SLIPPED THROUGH. SO CERTAINLY YOU COULDN'T OVERTURN IT. &gt;&gt; IT IS GOING TO BE THIRD DOWN AND 10 NOW. IT WAS WALSH WHO CAME SLIDING IN TO MAKE THE CALL. HE HAD THE BETTER ANGLE. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM SOME PROPS. HE WAS HUSTLING OVER THERE, TOO. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE DELAYING IT RIGHT NOW. IT'S CONCEIVABLE THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT A COUPLE OF SECONDS BACK ON THE CLOCK. BUT THEY'RE READY TO GO RIGHT NOW WITH 5:51 REMAINING AND ANOTHER KEY PLAY COMING UP HERE. THIRD DOWN AND 10 AT THE 17YARD LINE. UNDER PRESSURE. OFF HIS BACK FOOT. THE PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE PRESSURE WAS ON THAT TIME. THE DOLPHIN LINE DID ITS JOB. VINNY FORCED TO THROW HASTILY. AND IT'S FOURTH DOWN. AND NOW DOWN BY 10, THEY'RE GONNA ATTEMPT THE FIELD GOAL FROM HALL HERE AND GIVE THE BALL BACK, AND THEY'LL NEED TO SCORE 7. &gt;&gt; AND THAT CHALLENGE, IT TOOK SO LONG. IT REALLY STOLE ALL THE MOMENTUM AWAY FROM THE JETS. IF THEY HAD JUST LINED UP AND NOT HAD THE CHALLENGE, THEY WOULD'VE STILL HAD THAT GOOD FEELING ABOUT THEMSELVES. BUT THAT 3 1/2 MINUTES KILLED THEM. &gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, FOR THE DOLPHINS, THIS FOURTH QUARTER MUST SEEM LIKE A WEEK. THIS IS A 35YARD ATTEMPT FOR JOHN HALL. TUPA TO HOLD. SNAP WAS A LITTLE ERRANT, BUT TUPA GOT IT DOWN, AND HALL BANGS IT THROUGH. SHORT KICK. DROPPED. PICKED UP AT THE 14YARD LINE BY BROCK MARION. UP TO THE 31YARD LINE. YOU KNOW, IF I GO BACK TO THE CURIOUS CALL AT 3013 ON THE 2POINT TRY INSTEAD OF THE 1. IF IT PLAYS OUT THE WAY IT HAD, THE SCORE RIGHT NOW, IF THEY HAD GONE FOR THE 1 POINT, WOULD'VE BEEN 3024 AND THEY'D BE GOING FOR THE WIN AND NOT A TIE. BUT... &gt;&gt; AL, THAT'S WHY YOU ARE A GUEST ON "SQUAWK BOX" THE NUMBERS, THE WHOLE THING. YOU'RE ALL OVER IT. &gt;&gt; I LOVED BEING ON "SQUAWK BOX" TODAY. I JUST LOVED IT. &gt;&gt; I KNOW. YOU LOOKED EXUBERANT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA GET AN EMMY. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN FROM THE 29YARD LINE. FIEDLER THROWS. AND THAT IS NOT CAUGHT. INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR ORONDE GADSDEN. SO THEY COME OUT THROWING. THEY'RE NOT GONNA SIT ON IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT KILLS YOU THERE IS RIGHT HERE. SEE THAT CLOCK? STOPPED. YOU THROW THE BALL, YOU GOT TO MAKE COMPLETIONS, KEEP THAT CLOCK ROLLING. &gt;&gt; I'D GO UP TOP AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SECOND AND 10 AT THE 29YARD LINE. FIEDLER. FLAG THROWN. CAUGHT. 42. FOR THE MOMENT A FIRST DOWN. ORONDE GADSDEN. BUT A MARKER BACK AT THE 23YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; SAME PLAY, BETTER EXECUTED. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF HOLDING AGAINST THE OFFENSIVE LINE. AGAIN THE CLOCK STOPS. 5 SECONDS IS ALL THAT GOES OFF THE CLOCK. &gt;&gt; HOLDING. 71, OFFENSE. 10 YARDS. REPEAT SECOND DOWN. &gt;&gt; GOT THE ROOKIE, TODD WADE, WHO'S HAD A HECK OF A GAME RUNBLOCKING. THAT TIME PASSBLOCKING, GOT CALLED FOR HOLDING. THIS IS TWICE AS MANY PENALTIES FOR THE DOLPHINS AS THEY AVERAGE. RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN. THERE'S THE HOLD RIGHT THERE BY WADE. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A HOLD THAT NO QUARTERBACK WILL EVER GET UPSET WITH HIS OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, BECAUSE CLEARLY RICK LYLE HAD A CLEAR SHOT AT JAY FIEDLER. &gt;&gt; THE CLOCK NOW STARTS AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE OUTSIDE THE 5MINUTE MARK. SO WHEN THE BALL IS SIGNALED READY FOR PLAY, THAT'S WHY IT'S RUNNING. ON SECOND AND 20. FIEDLER THROWING INTO TRAFFIC AND IS LUCKY IT WASN'T PICKED OFF. THREE GREEN SHIRTS VICTOR GREEN AND MARCUS COLEMAN WERE TWO OF THEM SURROUNDING THE INTENDED RECEIVER. &gt;&gt; AND, AL, I THINK "GREEN" IS THE OPERATIVE WORD HERE GREEN AS IN EXPERIENCE FOR JAY FIEDLER. THAT WAS A DISASTROUS THROW. AGAIN, LUCKY THAT THE JETS DIDN'T COME AWAY WITH IT. TRYING TO GET SHEPHERD HERE. LOOK AT VICTOR GREEN. AND MARCUS COLEMAN. IF THEY DON'T BUMP INTO EACH OTHER, COLEMAN MAKES THE CATCH EASILY. &gt;&gt; FIEDLER SACKED AT THE 6YARD LINE! BRYAN COX UNABATED TO THE QUARTERBACK. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; HAVEN'T CALLED COX'S NAME THAT MUCH TONIGHT. HE'S SAVING IT UP FOR THE BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; FIRST SACK OF THE NIGHT FOR THE JETS DEFENSE. AND, BOY, DO THEY NEED IT. BRYAN COX COMES UP WITH A BIG PLAY AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAM. AND HE IS UNABATED AND BARELY BLOCKED BY RICHMOND WEBB. TOO MUCH SPEED FOR WEBB AROUND THE CORNER. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, AL. THEY WISH THEY HAD THAT EXTRA POINT NOW. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; STILL 4:38 LEFT IN REGULATION. TURK'S KICK IS A BAD ONE. IT'S A CORKSCREW THAT ROLLS DEAD AT THE 39YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; HEY, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE WAY THIS IS GOING, THE JETS MIGHT GET TWO MORE SCORES. &gt;&gt; IT'S A 23POINT DEFICIT THEY'RE TRYING TO ERASE AFTER A 34YARD KICK. THE DOLPHINS ALLOWING, AS WE'VE MENTIONED, AS MANY TOUCHDOWNS TONIGHT AS THEY HAD IN 24 QUARTERS. &gt;&gt; THE AMAZING THING IS THAT REMEMBER HOW POORLY THE JETS LOOKED? THEY LOOKED AWFUL IN THE FIRST HALF THROUGH THREE QUARTERS. NOW THE DOLPHINS LOOK THAT WAY. TERRIBLE, 34YARD PUNT THAT TIME. LOOK AT THE FIELD POSITION FOR THE JETS. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 39YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. AND ANDERSON ALMOST RAN INTO TESTAVERDE. BUT EVERYTHING IS WORKING! MARTIN TAKES IT TO THE 24. THEY HAD ANDERSON IN MOTION, WHO NEARLY RAN INTO VINNY ON THE WAY BACK. &gt;&gt; HE WAS LOOKING FOR THOSE TO HELP OUT ON THE BLITZ PICKUP. AND HE DID A NICE JOB. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S ALL WORKING FOR THE JETS. &gt;&gt; NOW TESTAVERDE SCRAMBLING. THROWING. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. INTENDED FOR RICHIE ANDERSON. &gt;&gt; HARD TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU'VE SEEN A TURNAROUND LIKE THIS. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT BUFFALO PLAYOFF GAME YEARS AGO. BUFFALOHOUSTON, WASN'T IT? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. FRANK REICH LEADING THE COMEBACK. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW SAM MADISON'S WISHING HE HAD HAMMERED THAT BALL INTO THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; JETS, ONLY ONE WIN IN THEIR HISTORY, WHICH BEGAN IN 1960, IN WHICH THEY TRAILED BY 20 OR MORE POINTS. THAT WAS AGAINST DENVER IN '78. THIS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST DEFICIT EVER OVERCOME. THAT ONE WAS 21. &gt;&gt; CHREBET. &gt;&gt; HERE'S VINNY THROWING TO THE END ZONE FOR CHREBET! CAN HE MAKE THE CATCH? YES! [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; CHREBET. LOOK AT THIS. &gt;&gt; WE'VE SEEN THAT CATCH BEFORE. SIX WEEKS AGO, IN THE SECOND GAME OF THE SEASON, THAT'S THE CATCH HE MADE AGAINST THE PATRIOTS TO WIN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; ALMOST AN EXACT REPLAY, AL. SAME CORNER OF THE END ZONE. &gt;&gt; CHREBET IS MAGIC. &gt;&gt; NOW THE EXTRA POINT TO TIE THE GAME, AND THERE'S STILL 3:55 TO GO. [ CROWD CHEERING ] AND FOR THOSE JETS FANS WHO LEFT THIS STADIUM ABOUT AN HOUR AGO AND WHOSE RADIOS ARE BROKEN IN THEIR CAR, HAVE WE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PASS PATTERNS THAT ONLY VINNY AND CHREBET CAN WORK. CHREBET WAS LOOKING FOR IT OVER HIS INSIDE SHOULDER. VINNY THREW IT OVER THE OUTSIDE BECAUSE HE READ THE DEFENSE. HE SAW WAYNE GET BEHIND JERRY WILSON AND HAD CONFIDENCE THAT CHREBET COULD MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT ON THIS BEAUTIFULLY THROWN PASS. &gt;&gt; DID YOU SEE CHREBET EXPLODE PAST WILSON? UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; HERE'S A GUY THAT YOU NEVER WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT HIS 40 SPEED YOU KNOW, 4.19, 4.2, 4.3. HE'S GOT FOOTBALL SPEED. LOOK AT THE QUICKNESS TO GET FREE AND THEN THE AWARENESS THAT THE BALL'S COMING OVER HIS OTHER SHOULDER. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS CALL HIS NUMBER. HE'LL RUN THROUGH A WALL FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU OUGHT TO GET THAT JERSEY THAT YOU WORE AUTOGRAPHED BY WAYNE CHREBET. &gt;&gt; I'M GETTING A NUMBER 80 TATTOO. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT VINNY. &gt;&gt; THE GAME IS TIED. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE TWO FACES OF EVE. &gt;&gt; IT CERTAINLY IS THE TWO HALVES OF VINNY. THERE'S NO QUESTION. &gt;&gt; IN TOTAL YARDAGE, IT'S ALMOST A DEAD HEAT 361 FOR MIAMI AND 360 FOR THE ONCEMORIBUND JETS. BROCK MARION FROM THE 7. AND BROCK MARION IS INTO JETS TERRITORY. TAKEN DOWN AT THE 46YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU EXPEND SO MUCH PSYCHIC ENERGY GETTING BACK TO EVEN FOOTING, YOU FORGET ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS, LIKE STOPPING A KICKOFF RETURN. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT SHOWS YOU THE DOLPHINS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT 51 FOR NOTHING. THEY'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD FOOTBALL TEAM. THIS IS ANSWERING THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW FOR BROCK MARION. &gt;&gt; AND WATCH JOHN HALL HERE, THE KICKER, WHO'S IN ON THE TACKLE, BECAUSE HE GOES LIMPING OFF THE FIELD AFTER THIS PLAY. THERE HE IS. AND THAT, OF COURSE, COULD BE HUGE IN A TIE GAME AT THE END. &gt;&gt; I THINK HE CAME DOWN ON HIS RIGHT KNEECAP OR SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; FIRST DOWN FOR MIAMI AT THE 46YARD LINE. THEY HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS PLUS THE 2MINUTE WARNING. FIEDLER. AND HE'S GOING FOR 6! INTO THE END ZONE AND WIDE OPEN IS SHEPHERD! TOUCHDOWN, MIAMI! THIS IS A STREET GAME. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A JETDOLPHIN OFFENSIVE GAME THAT WE KIND OF PREDICTED BEFORE THE GAME, RIGHT, AL? &gt;&gt; UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT ALL THAT DEFENSE. I THINK WE MISSED ON THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT. WHAT A PLAY BY FIEDLER. AND WHAT A CALL BY CHAN GAILEY. THEY HAD GREAT FIELD POSITION. COULD HAVE MOVED THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD AND KICKED THE WINNING FIELD GOAL. BUT GAILEY GOES FOR THE HOME RUN ON FIRST DOWN AND GETS IT. &gt;&gt; I HAD A VIBE THIS IS THE WAY IT WAS GONNA PLAY OUT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU DID. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, YOU DID. &gt;&gt; THE EXTRA POINT BY MARE IS GOOD. SO THE RUNBACK BY MARION. THE BOMB FROM FIEDLER TO SHEPHERD. THAT'S HIS SECOND TOUCHDOWN CATCH OF THE NIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHO'S WINNING? [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT THE LITTLE OUTANDUP MOVE. AARON GLENN DROPS HIS COVERAGE. NOW HE'S LOOKING FOR HELP FROM VICTOR GREEN. WHAT A PASS BY JAY FIEDLER. AIRED THAT ONE OUT ABOUT 60 YARDS ON A LINE. &gt;&gt; LESLIE DOING THE "SHH." &gt;&gt; SO I SEE SHEPHERD BEFORE THE GAME. HE SAYS, "CAN YOU MENTION THAT MY SON, KHALEK, WHO'S 8 YEARS OLD, IS ON THE PRO BOWL TEAM IN HIS YOUTH FOOTBALL ORGANIZATION?" I SAID, "LESLIE, YOU TURN IN TWO BIG PLAYS TONIGHT, I'M YOUR GUY." I JUST DID IT, LESLIE. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] I THINK DAD MAY BE GOING TO THE PRO BOWL IF HE KEEPS THIS UP. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE LESLIE CALLED THE SHOT. THAT'S FOR YOU, KHALEK. &gt;&gt; YES. CHAN GAILEY REVERTING BACK TO HIS O.C. DAYS AT PITTSBURGH. AND THE REACTION OF THOSE ON THE JETS BENCH. AFTER WATCHING A 23POINT COMEBACK GO BACK OUT THE WINDOW IN ABOUT A 1:40. ONE TIMEOUT PLUS THE 2MINUTE WARNING. THEY HAVE SCORED 24 POINTS 23, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THEY WENT FOR THE 2 AND DIDN'T GET IT ON THEIR LAST FOUR POSSESSIONS. AND THAT IS CAUGHT BY CURTIS MARTIN AS HE CROSSES THE 50, TO THE 47. AND THE JETS HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE HUDDLE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S WORKED SUPERBLY FOR THEM. THE HUDDLE WAS SCREWING THEM UP. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A LITTLE DUMPOFF TO MARTIN! AND HE TAKES IT TO THE 37YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; VINNY THREW THAT LIKE I THROW IT. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE IN A PUB, SHOOTING DARTS. &gt;&gt; THAT OFFENSIVE LINE IS DOING A JOB. ONLY ONE SACK ON VINNY ALL NIGHT LONG, AND THAT CAME ON THE VERY FIRST SERIES OF PLAYS. &gt;&gt; TESTAVERDE WITH A 313YARD NIGHT. COMES THIS WAY. AND THE CATCH IS YES. IT IS MADE AT THE 31YARD LINE. DEDRIC WARD. FLAG IS THROWN AT THE END OF THE PLAY. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO 313 YARDS, AL. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY TAKE THIS TRAIL. &gt;&gt; WACKO. THIS TRAIL. HOLDING, DEFENSE MIAMI. &gt;&gt; WACKO. &gt;&gt; THIS WILL GIVE THEM A FIRST HOLDING, DEFENSE MIAMI. DOWN. &gt;&gt; THIS WILL GIVE THEM A FIRST THE CATCH WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN DOWN. THEM A FIRST DOWN, SO THEY'LL THE CATCH WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN TAKE THE PENALTY AND THE THEM A FIRST DOWN, SO THEY'LL 5 YARDS. TAKE THE PENALTY AND THE &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THEY WENT BACK AND 5 YARDS. OPENED UP THE OFFENSE, FIEDLER &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THEY WENT BACK AND STARTED CLICKING AGAIN. OPENED UP THE OFFENSE, FIEDLER MAYBE THIS WILL BE AN ABJECT STARTED CLICKING AGAIN. LESSON FOR WANNSTEDT NOT TO SIT MAYBE THIS WILL BE AN ABJECT ON IT THAT EARLY NEXT TIME. LESSON FOR WANNSTEDT NOT TO SIT &gt;&gt; WELL, REMEMBER THAT ONE ON IT THAT EARLY NEXT TIME. SERIES OF PLAYS WHEN THEY WENT &gt;&gt; WELL, REMEMBER THAT ONE THREE STRAIGHT HANDOFFS IN THE SERIES OF PLAYS WHEN THEY WENT MIDDLE OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THREE STRAIGHT HANDOFFS IN THE AND JUST KICKED THE BALL BACK TO MIDDLE OF THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THE JETS AND THE JETS GOT HOT. AND JUST KICKED THE BALL BACK TO &gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT LIKE YOU SAID AT THE JETS AND THE JETS GOT HOT. THE TIME, THEY DID BURN &gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT LIKE YOU SAID AT 2 MINUTES THERE. THE TIME, THEY DID BURN HE COULDN'T HAVE FORESEEN IT 2 MINUTES THERE. GETTING THIS WEIRD. HE COULDN'T HAVE FORESEEN IT BUT I THINK EARLIER ON IN THE GETTING THIS WEIRD. GAME, HE GOT TOO CONSERVATIVE, BUT I THINK EARLIER ON IN THE TOO. GAME, HE GOT TOO CONSERVATIVE, &gt;&gt; AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. TOO. &gt;&gt; JERRY WILSON. &gt;&gt; AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; HERE HE IS NUMBER 24, &gt;&gt; JERRY WILSON. RIGHT THERE, AND HE REACHES OUT &gt;&gt; HERE HE IS NUMBER 24, AND GRABS CHREBET AROUND THE RIGHT THERE, AND HE REACHES OUT THROAT. AND GRABS CHREBET AROUND THE &gt;&gt; I'M PRETTY SURE I'D GET THAT THROAT. KID OFF CHREBET RIGHT NOW, &gt;&gt; I'M PRETTY SURE I'D GET THAT 'CAUSE CHREBET, I THINK, KID OFF CHREBET RIGHT NOW, BELIEVES HE CAN DO ANYTHING. &gt;&gt; THE ONE THING THE DOLPHINS ARE GONNA DO IS PLAY TWODEEP AND GIVE THE CORNERBACKS HELP DEEP. THEY'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE CHREBET ALONE ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; VINNY WITH A 211YARD QUARTER. AND EVEN MORE! WIDE OPEN IS ANDERSON. ANDERSON TO THE 12YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF THE CLOCK NOW. IF YOU SCORE TOO QUICKLY, THE DOLPHINS GET THE BALL BACK, AND THEY'VE GOT THREE TIMEOUTS LEFT. &gt;&gt; VINNY. TO THE GROUND! MARTIN TAKEN DOWN AT THE 6YARD LINE. BRIAN WALKER COMES IN. IT'S GOING TO BE SECOND DOWN AND 3. AND THE JETS WILL TAKE A TIMEOUT HERE, THEIR FINAL TIMEOUT. AND THEN THEY HAVE ONE MORE STOPPAGE, AT THE 2MINUTE WARNING. SECOND DOWN, 3, FROM THE 6. &gt;&gt; THOSE GAMES ARE CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF SUNUP. &gt;&gt; VINNY TO THE END ZONE. AND OFF HIS BACK FOOT. IT'S INCOMPLETE. TIPPED IN THE AIR BY BRIAN WALKER. &gt;&gt; STILL GOT 5 SECONDS BEFORE THE 2MINUTE WARNING. [ LAUGHS ] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A GREAT PLAY BY BRIAN WALKER. AND TESTAVERDE TRYING TO GET THE BALL OVER HIS HEAD. COULDN'T DO IT, OR HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN PASS. &gt;&gt; WALKER'S HAD A GREAT GAME ON BOTH SIDES OF IT DEFENDING THE PASS, AND HE'S BEEN THE HARDEST HITTER ON THE FIELD TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHERE THE JETS REALLY DO MISS KEYSHAWN JOHNSON. &gt;&gt; THIRD DOWN AND 3. THEY HAVE CHREBET SLOTTED TO THE RIGHT. THEY SEND WARD IN MOTION THAT WAY. THE HANDOFF GOES TO ANDERSON. AND HE GETS TO THE 4. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A GIGANTIC PLAY COMING UP. IT'S THE 2MINUTE WARNING, AND IT'S FOURTH AND 1. AT THE 4YARD LINE. SO TAKE US THROUGH THE MINDSET RIGHT NOW OF HENNING AND GROH AND TESTAVERDE. &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT BECAUSE THE BALL IS ON THE FAR HASH MARK, IT GIVES THE JETS A LOT OF OPTIONS TO USE THE WIDE SIDE OF THE FIELD FOR A RIGHTHANDED QUARTERBACK IN TESTAVERDE. WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA GO FOR THE FIRST DOWN OR FOR THE TOUCHDOWN, I THINK IT'S RATHER IRRELEVANT BECAUSE THEY'RE THINKING THAT EITHER PLAY THAT THEY CALL WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BOTH THOSE FEATS. SO TESTAVERDE THEY LIKE THE BUNCH WHERE THEY CROWD THE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT SIDE OFF OF THE WING. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY TRIED A TYPE OF PICK PLAY, HAVE VINNY ROLL OUT TO THE RIGHT AND TRY TO GET ANDERSON OR MARTIN LOOSE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND MAYBE RUN IT IN. &gt;&gt; THEY NEED A LONG YARD FOR A FIRST DOWN AND 4 YARDS FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. SO IT COMES DOWN TO THIS. VINNY THROWING. AND STOPPED AT THE 1 IS ANDERSON, BUT HE HAS THE FIRST DOWN! HE HAS THE FIRST DOWN. NO TIMEOUTS. NEEDED A LONG YARD. GOT 2 1/2. &gt;&gt; RICHIE ANDERSON NOT EVEN PAYING ATTENTION TO HIS PHYSICAL WELLBEING. &gt;&gt; WELL, THEY BROUGHT THE RECEIVER IN MOTION, OVERLOADED THE RIGHT SIDE. AND ANDERSON WITH A FABULOUS CATCH BEFORE JERRY WILSON CAN DRILL HIM. GOOD THROW BY TESTAVERDE. WHAT A CATCH UNDER PRESSURE. &gt;&gt; ANDERSON HAS CAUGHT 11 PASSES TONIGHT FOR 103 YARDS. MARTIN. CAN'T GET IN. STOPPED BY TAYLOR. DID I SEE THAT GRAPHIC CORRECT? 19 FIRST DOWNS IN THIS QUARTER? THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE! &gt;&gt; THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO HAVE 19 PLAYS IN A QUARTER. THAT AVERAGES OUT TO ALMOST 80 A GAME. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT. UNBELIEVABLE. THEY HAD 10 IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS. MEANWHILE, SECOND DOWN AND GOAL FROM THE 2. OUT OF THE TIGHT FORMATION. FAKE TO MARTIN. THEN A DUMP. AND IS JUGGLED AND CAUGHT BY JUMBO ELLIOTT! [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; WELL, JUMBO THEY HAD THE HANDS TEAM IN. &gt;&gt; THE TACKLE LINES UP AS AN ELIGIBLE RECEIVER AT THE END OF THE LINE. HE'S OPEN. HE'S JUGGLING. HE'S FALLING DOWN. AND THEY'RE 1 POINT FROM TYING THE GAME. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TRICK PLAY OR A SITUATIONALLY APPROPRIATE PLAY FOR AL GROH AND THE JETS. WHAT WILL HE THINK OF NEXT? &gt;&gt; HEY, I GOT TO GIVE MY BOY AL SOME PRAISE FOR CALLING THAT POINTAFTER THING AROUND 2 1/2 DAYS AGO. &gt;&gt; IN THE MEANTIME, THAT IS ELLIOTT'S IT'S THE FIRST CATCH OF HIS CAREER. HE'S PLAYED 173 GAMES. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU CAN'T SHUT HIM DOWN FOREVER, AL. &gt;&gt; AND THE DOLPHINS ARE CHALLENGING WHETHER HE DID HAVE POSSESSION. &gt;&gt; WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE REVIEWING IT UPSTAIRS. REMEMBER, YOU'RE INSIDE 2 MINUTES, SO THIS IS THE CALL FROM THE BOOTH UPSTAIRS. THE BOOTH CAN STOP THE PLAY. SO UPSTAIRS. IT IS NOW TAKEN OUT OF THE COACHES' HANDS IN THE FINAL 2 MINUTES OF EITHER HALF. LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK HERE. DOES ELLIOTT HAVE POSSESSION? &gt;&gt; HE OVERTURNS THAT, HE'D BETTER CRAWL INSIDE THAT HOOD. THIS PLACE WILL GO BALLISTIC. &gt;&gt; THE CROSSBAR SORT OF GOT IN THE WAY AT THE END OF THE REPLAY. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM THIS ANGLE NOW. JUGGLE, JUGGLE, JUGGLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A CATCH. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOT IT. YES. YEP. &gt;&gt; HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T MAKE IT EASY FOR ANYBODY HERE AT GIANTS STADIUM. ONE BOBBLE, TWO BOBBLES, THREE BOBBLES. &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY IS THAT HIS FIRST CATCH, THAT'S HIS FIRST THREE CATCHES. &gt;&gt; HE STARTED THE SEASON HE WAS SUSPENDED FOR THE FIRST GAME. HE PLAYED IN GAME 2. HE HASN'T EVEN PLAYED SINCE THE LAST MONDAYNIGHT GAME, AGAINST NEW ENGLAND IN SEPTEMBER. &gt;&gt; HE GOT HIS MONEY'S WORTH. THEY CAN'T OVERTURN THAT. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, IT WAS RULED A TOUCHDOWN, SO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SEE IS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT IT WASN'T, NOT THE REVERSE. &gt;&gt; TO GO ALONG WITH THE FAKE AND EVERYTHING, HE DIDN'T TAKE HIS GLOVES OFF. HE'S GOT HIS BLOCKING GLOVES ON. AND HE'S GOT HIMSELF A TOUCHDOWN. &gt;&gt; HE DOES. BY THE TIME THE BALL HITS THE GROUND, HE'S ALREADY TAKEN THAT LITTLE HOP, AND THE PLAY WOULD'VE BEEN OVER BY THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A 305POUND HOP. IT'S JUST SO STRANGE TO SEE A NUMBER 76 CATCHING A PASS. YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO GIVE IT TO AL GROH AND DAN HENNING. GROH SAYS HE GOES BY A GUT FEELING BUT HE ALSO HAS THE HELP FROM HIS ENTIRE OFFENSIVE COACHING STAFF WHEN HE GOES FOR A TRICK PLAY, GADGET PLAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. &gt;&gt; HEY, WHEN YOU'RE THROWING PASSES TO A 305POUND GUY, I'LL CALL IT A GUT FEELING. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] BADABING. &gt;&gt; WELL, 42 SECONDS LEFT. A LOT CAN HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE GROH IS SPENDING THIS TIME DURING THE DELAY FIGURING OUT HOW TO GO FOR A 2POINT CONVERSION OUT OF A KICK FORMATION. &gt;&gt; JUMBO CHECKING OUT THE JUMBOTRON HERE AT GIANTS STADIUM. &gt;&gt; THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO CAUGHT THE FIRST PASS OF HIS CAREER. IT WAS THE FIRST TOUCHDOWN OF HIS CAREER. &gt;&gt; AFTER REVIEWING THE PLAY, THE RULING ON THE FIELD STANDS. TOUCHDOWN. [ CROWD CHEERING ] &gt;&gt; JUMBO WAS HAVING AN OUTOFBODY EXPERIENCE THERE. ALL RIGHT. WE SAW HALL GET HURT EARLIER. &gt;&gt; HE LIMPED OFF THE FIELD. HE MADE A TACKLE ON HIS LAST KICKOFF. NOW TO TIE THE GAME. TOM TUPA TO HOLD. THE EXTRA POINT. TUPA GETS IT DOWN, AND IT JUST DOES GET INSIDE THE UPRIGHT. TOM TUPA IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE LEAGUE AT HANDLING SNAPS LIKE THAT AND GETTING THEM DOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL JOB BY TUPA. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THAT WAS A HORRIBLE SNAP BY BRADFORD BANTA. THIS BALL WAS FIRED AT TUPA'S HEAD. KIND OF A KNUCKLEBALL, AT THAT. HE GETS IT DOWN ON THE POINT. &gt;&gt; [ LAUGHS ] AND HALL FALLS DOWN. HERE IS JOHN HALL NOW TO KICK OFF. A GREAT RUNBACK BY MARION SET UP MIAMI'S LAST TOUCHDOWN. AND MARION WILL CORRAL THIS ONE AT THE 11YARD LINE. AND MARION! A BEAUTY AGAIN, TO MIDFIELD. HE'S TO THE 49. THE DOLPHINS HAVE ALL OF THEIR TIMEOUTS. THEY HAVE ALL THREE. THEY HAVE 34 SECONDS AND, IN OLINDO MARE, AN OUTSTANDING KICKER. &gt;&gt; IF THEY GET 15 YARDS, THEY GET MARE WITHIN HIS RANGE. 15 YARDS WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT A 52YARD FIELD GOAL, AND MARE'S CAREER BEST IS 54 YARDS. AND THE DOLPHINS HAVE ALL THREE TIMEOUTS. &gt;&gt; AT THE 49YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN FOR THE DOLPHINS. THEY SEND McDUFFIE AND GADSDEN WIDE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WATCH CHAN. HE MIGHT GO DEEP AGAIN. HE'S FEELING IT. &gt;&gt; FIEDLER. BATTED. INCOMPLETE. KNOCKED AWAY BY SHANE BURTON. &gt;&gt; HUGE PLAY BY SHANE BURTON. HE WAS STUFFED AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE BY TODD WADE. HAD NOWHERE TO GO. SAW THE BALL, SAW FIEDLER LET IT GO, AND THEN JUMPED UP AND KNOCKED IT DOWN. BIG PLAY. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 49. SECOND AND 10. THREE RECEIVERS TO THE RIGHT. McDUFFIE TO THE LEFT. AND THEY GIVE IT TO THURMAN THOMAS! AND HE'S GONNA PASS, BUT NOBODY'S OPEN, SO THURMAN'S GOING TO TRY TO TAKE OFF AND GETS KNOCKED DOWN AT THE 47YARD LINE. THEY TAKE A TIMEOUT. 18 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS GONNA THROW BACK ACROSS THE FIELD TO FIEDLER, I THINK THE PLAY WAS DESIGNED. &gt;&gt; YES, HE WAS. ABSOLUTELY, DENNIS. GOOD CALL. AND YOU KNOW WHO MADE THE PLAY WAS BRYAN COX. COX SAW FIEDLER COME OUT OF THE BACKFIELD. NOW HE'S TELLING THE DOLPHIN BENCH THAT "I'M SMART. I SAW THAT PLAY. COME ON. TRY ME AGAIN. COME ON!" THERE'S YOUR NEW YORK CHALLENGE, DENNIS, RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; BOY, IF COX HAD GOTTEN BEAT BY FIEDLER FOR A GAMEWINNING TOUCHDOWN THE QB GETS DEEP ON YOU? HE'D NEVER LIVE THAT DOWN. THIS CITY WOULD NEVER FORGIVE. &gt;&gt; WHAT THE DOLPHINS NEED NOW THEY PUT TWO MORE SECONDS BACK ON THE CLOCK 17 TICKS. TO GET MARE TO WITHIN RANGE WHERE, LET'S SAY, HE KICKS A 50YARDER, THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET 20 YARDS ON THIS NEXT PLAY AND TAKE A TIMEOUT OR GET OUT OF BOUNDS. &gt;&gt; GREAT INSTINCTS BY COX. HE SNIFFED THAT OUT SO EARLY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. FIEDLER KIND OF GAVE IT AWAY. HE HANDED THE BALL OFF, AND HE LOOKED LIKE THE CAT THAT ATE THE MOUSE. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT'S HE SUPPOSED TO DO, JUST GO LIMP THERE FOR A SECOND? &gt;&gt; WELL, HE SHOULD LOOK AROUND AND FOLLOW WHERE HE HANDED THE BALL OFF AND THEN TAKE OFF. HE NEVER LOOKED BACK TO THOMAS. &gt;&gt; FIEDLER LOOKING FOR AT LEAST 20 YARDS. UNDER PRESSURE. NEARLY GETS SACKED. PASS IS INCOMPLETE. SHANE BURTON HAD HIM WRAPPED UP AGAIN. AND FIEDLER IN AGONY. SO FIEDLER'S STILL DOWN. [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] WITH 12 SECONDS LEFT IN REGULATION. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, HE'S COMING OFF HIP SURGERY OF JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK. HE GETS HIT BY SHANE BURTON, NUMBER 98, AS HE'S STEPPING UP INTO THIS POCKET FROM THE LEFT SIDE RIGHT THERE. THAT COULD BE AN ANKLE. THAT COULD BE A LEFT KNEE. PROBABLY THE ANKLE. &gt;&gt; OOH. &gt;&gt; BOY, THEN HE GETS DRILLED. &gt;&gt; YEAH, AND THEN COX COMES IN AT THE END. HERE'S MATT TURK TO PUNT ON FOURTH DOWN. AND THAT ONE, WITH NOBODY EVEN BACK TO FIELD IT FOR THE JETS, WILL ROLL TO A HALT AS THE CLOCK GOES TO TRIPLE ZEROES. SO WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF REGULATION. &gt;&gt; LET'S CRANK THAT HANK WILLIAMS THING UP AGAIN. ♪ ARE YOU READY FOR SOME O.T.? ♪ &gt;&gt; WELL, THE GAME IS APPROACHING THE FOURHOUR MARK. &gt;&gt; DANNO, IS YOUR FLIGHT OUT OF NEWARK? YOU OUGHT TO JUST STAY OUT HERE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN TO A FOOTBALL GAME OR SEEN ONE OR PLAYED IN ONE THAT'S GONE FOUR HOURS. I MEAN, YOU JUST DON'T SAY "FOURHOUR FOOTBALL GAME." &gt;&gt; FOUR HOURS AND WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH LONGER TO GO? AND HERE COMES THE VERY ALLIMPORTANT COIN FLIP. THE WINNER OF THIS FLIP IS GONNA GET THE FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; WELL, I GUESS YOU GET 21 FIRST DOWNS IN ONE PERIOD, THAT AUGERS FOR A FOURHOUR GAME. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, MEN. WE'RE GONNA PLAY A 15MINUTE OVERTIME PERIOD. EACH TEAM GETS AN ADDITIONAL TWO TIMEOUTS. FIRST TEAM THAT SCORES WINS. MIAMI IS THE VISITORS. THEY'LL CALL THE COIN. &gt;&gt; HEADS. &gt;&gt; HIS CHOICE IS HEADS. &gt;&gt; THEY USUALLY BRING PHIL LUCKETT IN FOR THESE. &gt;&gt; IT IS A HEADS. MIAMI WON THE TOSS. THEY WILL RECEIVE. &gt;&gt; SO THE DOLPHINS WILL GET IT. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEND A SHOUTOUT TO DIANE SAWYER, WHO'S JUST GETTING UP. HI, DI. &gt;&gt; GETTING UP? SHE'S ALREADY IN THE STUDIO. &gt;&gt; HERE'S BROCK MARION TO RETURN THE KICK. J.J. JOHNSON BACK THERE AS WELL. &gt;&gt; JOHN HALL SENDS IT INTO THE EARLYMORNING SKY, AND IT'S FIELDED BY MARION AT THE 6YARD LINE. UP PAST THE 30. AND ANOTHER GOOD BROCK MARION RUNBACK THIRD IN A ROW, THIS TIME TO THE 37YARD LINE. AND FIEDLER IS OKAY. SO HERE IS FIEDLER, TAKING THAT MONSTER SHOT WITH 12 SECONDS TO GO. PRONE ON THE TURF FOR ALMOST 3 MINUTES. WALKS OFF UNDER HIS OWN POWER. HE MUST HAVE BEEN TO LOURDES. HERE HE IS. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. HE'S NOT EVEN LIMPING. LOOKED LIKE HE SPRAINED HIS LEFT ANKLE OR HIS LEFT KNEE. AND HE RAN OUT TO THE HUDDLE LIKE THERE'S NOTHING. &gt;&gt; MAYBE HE'S JUST FUZZY. MAYBE IT WAS THE COX SHOT, THE SECOND ONE IN. MAYBE THE LEG NEVER DID GET HURT. &gt;&gt; COULD HAVE BEEN. &gt;&gt; IF THAT'S THE CASE, THOUGH, HE'S PROBABLY A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 33YARD LINE. FIRST DOWN. THE FAKE. AND THEN OPEN BUT UNDERTHROWING IT, AND IT'S INCOMPLETE TO JED WEAVER, THE TIGHT END. HE'D GOTTEN OPEN. HE THINKS HE MADE THE CATCH, BUT THE OFFICIAL SAYS, "NO, SIR." &gt;&gt; DENNIS, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, BECAUSE HE HAD WEAVER WIDE OPEN THERE. HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS. AND WHO CAN BLAME HIM AFTER TAKING THAT SHOT? &gt;&gt; THE IRONIC THING IS THE HEAD SHOT IS THE WORST PART, BUT IT'S THE HARDEST ONE TO READ, TOO. YOU CAN SEE A GUY LIMP. YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE HIS BEAN RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; THERE'S THE TACKLE BY BURTON AND THE HIT BY COX. &gt;&gt; TESTAVERDE WAITING ON THE SIDELINE. SECOND DOWN AND 10 FROM THE 37. AND THAT'S CAUGHT BY GADSDEN, BUT HE IS BLANKETED IMMEDIATELY BY MARCUS COLEMAN. GAIN OF ABOUT 5. THEY'LL SPOT IT AT THE 42. IT'LL BE THIRD AND 5. &gt;&gt; DANNO UNBELIEVABLY POINTS OUT TO ME, AL, AT THE COMMERCIAL VINNY HAS FIVE TOUCHDOWNS. &gt;&gt; AND 337 YARDS THROUGH THE AIR. 54 FLINGS TONIGHT. [ CROWD CHEERING ] A LOT OF THE CROWD WENT HOME. IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THEM ARE BACK. THIRD DOWN AND 5 FROM THE 42. AND THAT'S INTERCEPTED BY COLEMAN! AND THEN HE FUMBLES! AND MIAMI'S GONNA WIND UP GETTING THE BALL BACK WITH A FIRST DOWN! OF ALL THINGS, ON THIRD DOWN AND 5, THE JETS GET POSSESSION AND THEN ONCE THEY GET POSSESSION, IF YOU FUMBLE THE BALL AND THE OTHER TEAM RECOVERS, THEY GET IT BACK WITH A FIRST DOWN. &gt;&gt; UNBELIEVABLE. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION. &gt;&gt; INTERCEPTION, THEN A FUMBLE, THEN A RECOVERY BY MIAMI. FIRST AND 10 FOR MIAMI. &gt;&gt; AND A GREAT PLAY BY GADSDEN NOT ONLY TO RECOVER BUT TO STAY IN BOUNDS WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YEAH, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE BY COLEMAN. HIS SECOND INTERCEPTION OF THE NIGHT. IF HE FALLS DOWN RIGHT THERE, THE JETS ARE IN GREAT SHAPE. BUT THURMAN THOMAS CAME BY AND POPPED THE BALL LOOSE. TALK ABOUT A VETERAN PLAY BY THURMAN THOMAS. THERE HE IS NUMBER 34. AND GADSDEN, WITH BOTH FEET IN. &gt;&gt; FIRST AND 10 AT THE 34YARD LINE. GOOD PROTECTION. CAUGHT. SHORT GAIN. THAT'S THE TIGHT END, HUNTER GOODWIN. TACKLED BY VICTOR GREEN. GAIN OF 4. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT, AL. THE STADIUM HAS REFILLED. &gt;&gt; IT HAS! &gt;&gt; I THINK EVER SINCE THE HEIDI GAME I KNOW THAT WAS OUT AT SHEA BUT THEY'VE BUILT A TURNAROUND DOWN THERE AT THE LINCOLN TUNNEL. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING AROUND HERE THE HEIDI GAME WAS IN OAKLAND THIS CROWD, WHICH WAS 75,000, WENT TO ABOUT 30,000, AND NOW IT'S UP TO ABOUT 50,000. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY KEPT THE DOOR OPEN. &gt;&gt; THEY DID! &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO FOR THAT HEIDIGAME THING. I SMELLED TROUBLE THERE. SMELLED A LOT OF TROUBLE, AL. &gt;&gt; SECOND DOWN AND 5. &gt;&gt; AL KNOWS ALL ABOUT THOSE RAIDER GAMES. &gt;&gt; AT THE 39YARD LINE. DON'T I? A LITTLE TOSS BACK TO SMITH. AND SMITH, WHO HAD A TREMENDOUS FIRST HALF AND HAS HAD A SILENT SECOND HALF, GETS A FIRST DOWN TO THE 45. THIS GAME APPROACHING THE FOURHOUR MARK. OUR MINISTER OF INFORMATION, STEVE HURT, TELLING ME IN THE HISTORY OF "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL," ONLY ONE GAME WENT OVER FOUR HOURS GIANTSCARDINALS, A 2020 OVERTIME TIE IN 1983. KICKOFF HERE WAS 10 AFTER 9:00. THAT WAS THE GAME THAT HELPED SEND COSELL INTO RETIREMENT. THAT WAS HOWARD'S LAST YEAR. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. BLAME IT ON DENNIS MILLER. WEIRD STUFF HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 46YARD LINE. FIEDLER FLIPS IT OUT TO KONRAD. AND THE FULLBACK TAKES IT TO THE 46YARD LINE. THAT'S A GAIN OF LET'S CALL IT 8. IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN AND 2. TACKLED BY VICTOR GREEN. &gt;&gt; IF I WERE WANNSTEDT NOW, I WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT ONE THING AND CHAN GAILEY WOULD BE, TOO IT'S GIVING THE BALL TO LAMAR SMITH. FINISH THIS GAME AS YOU STARTED THIS GAME WITH SMITH POUNDING THE BALL AT A TIRED JET DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, COLLEGE FOOTBALL 1 AGAINST 2, NEBRASKAOKLAHOMA SATURDAY AT NOON. SECOND DOWN AND A LONG 2 HERE. THE BALL IS AT THE 47YARD LINE. THE BALL IS HANDED TO SMITH. AND SMITH WHEELING AND SPINNING AND PICKS UP THE FIRST DOWN AS HE GETS INSIDE THE 44YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE BEFORE THE LAST TWO CARRIES FOR SMITH, WE HADN'T CALLED HIS NAME OR HE HADN'T HAD ANY RUSHES THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF. SO HE IS FRESH. HE'S NOT HAD TO TAKE THE POUNDING. HE'S CARRIED THE BALL NOW 23 TIMES, BUT MOST OF THAT WAS IN THE FIRST HALF. &gt;&gt; THIS MUST FEEL LIKE TWOADAYS TO HIM. GO AWAY, HAVE A LUNCH, TAKE A NAP, COME BACK FOR A LATE PRACTICE. &gt;&gt; AT THE 43YARD LINE. ONE MORE FIRST DOWN, AND THEY'LL BE IN FIELDGOAL RANGE FOR MARE. AND THAT IS PICKED OFF AGAIN BY COLEMAN! &gt;&gt; DOWN. DOWN BY CONTACT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT TIME, THE PLAY IS DEAD AT THE 33YARD LINE BECAUSE CONTACT WAS MADE BY GADSDEN. &gt;&gt; WOW. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO MARCUS COLEMAN FOR HANGING IN THERE MENTALLY. HE MADE THE PLAY EARLIER TO PICK IT OFF IN FRONT OF GADSDEN, AND THEN HE READ THE EYES OF THE QUARTERBACK HERE AND THE ROUTE BY GADSDEN ANOTHER OUT ROUTE. THROWN WAY TOO FAR TO THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; LIFE DOESN'T OFTEN AFFORD YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OFF THE HOOK THAT QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; THAT INTERCEPTION IS HIS THIRD OF THE GAME, AND THAT TIES A JETS TEAM MARK. &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, SCHWARZENEGGER'S FILM HAD A GREAT OPENING WEEKEND. &gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, SCHWARZENEGGER SAID THE JETS WERE GONNA WIN WHEN THEY WERE DOWN BY 23. &gt;&gt; HASTA LA VISTA, BABY. &gt;&gt; HE IS SO OUT OF THIS STADIUM. &gt;&gt; FROM THE 34YARD LINE. TESTAVERDE THROWING FOR CHREBET. AND THAT'S INCOMPLETE. BRIAN WALKER COVERING ON THE PLAY. GO BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE TOP OF THE GAME THE WINNER OF THIS GAME IS IN UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF FIRST PLACE IN THE AFC EAST. AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO, IT WAS MIAMI IN A LOCK. IT WAS 307 AT ONE POINT. AND THE JETS WITH 21 FOURTHQUARTER FIRST DOWNS, 23 POINTS. THEN THE DOLPHINS TOOK THE LEAD, 3730 AND THE JETS CAUGHT THEM AT THE END. SECOND DOWN AND 10. TESTAVERDE TO MARTIN. AND HE GETS DRAGGED DOWN BY MARION AS HE MAKES THE CATCH AT THE 41. IT'LL BE THIRD DOWN AND 3. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST MINDBOGGLING TO ME THAT TESTAVERDE COULD LOOK THAT DISHEVELED EARLY IN THE GAME AND THIS RADARLOCKED. &gt;&gt; IT'S KIND OF THE WAY HIS SEASON HAS GONE. HE'S PLAYED VERY, VERY WELL LATE IN BALLGAMES. &gt;&gt; BIG THIRD AND 3. VINNY THROWS. CAUGHT! IT IS CHREBET! TO THE 40. TO THE 32YARD LINE. ZACH THOMAS CATCHES HIM FROM BEHIND. &gt;&gt; CHREBET IS NAILS. &gt;&gt; AND CHREBET IS WORKING AGAINST JERRY WILSON AGAIN. TESTAVERDE HAS GONE TO CHREBET WHEN HE'S ON WILSON. CHREBET COMES UP LIMPING NOW. WILSON'S 24. LOOK AT THIS BALL, RIGHT ON THE TARGET THERE. WILSON A LITTLE BIT LATE REACTING, AND THEN CHREBET'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A CONVOY DOWN THE SIDELINE. WHAT A GREAT TACKLE BY ZACH THOMAS, WHO'S PLAYING ON A BAD ANKLE. A FASTBALL, FINALLY, FROM TESTAVERDE. &gt;&gt; CHREBET'S GOT A LOT OF LENNY DYKSTRA IN HIM. &gt;&gt; 31YARD LINE. THEY'RE ALREADY IN FIELDGOAL RANGE FOR HALL. HIS CAREER LONG IS 55. RICHIE ANDERSON TO THE 25YARD LINE. IT'LL BE SECOND DOWN AND 4. ROBERT JONES MAKES THE TACKLE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE 12th CATCH OF THE NIGHT FOR RICHIE ANDERSON. WE TALKED ABOUT HIS VERSATILITY AND HOW HE'S FILLING THE VOID. [ WHISTLES BLOWING ] &gt;&gt; WHISTLE BEFORE THE SNAP. NO PLAY. WELL, YOU HEARD OF THE MIRACLE METS, OF COURSE. &gt;&gt; TIMEOUT, MIAMI. HOW ABOUT THE MIRACLE JETS? &gt;&gt; FIRST TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; THREE TIMES THIS YEAR NOT ONLY HAVE THEY COME FROM BEHIND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THEY HAVE TRAILED IN THOSE THREE GAMES WITH 4 MINUTES TO PLAY. THIS WOULD BE THE FOURTH TIME IN SEVEN GAMES THEY WOULD HAVE TRAILED WITH 4 MINUTES TO GO AND WON THE GAME. &gt;&gt; THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SERIES. THEY'VE HAD SO MANY MEMORABLE GAMES WITH KEN O'BRIEN AND DAN MARINO THROWING IT ALL OVER THE LOT. BUT I WOULD PUT THIS ONE UP AGAINST ANY OF THEM. WE ALREADY SAW GRIESE AND NAMATH AND THEIR BATTLE. THIS WAS REALLY TWO DIFFERENT TEAMS FOR BOTH TEAMS. THE DOLPHINS STARTED OUT GREAT. THE JETS WERE TERRIBLE. THAT FLIPFLOPPED. AND THEN, AFTER THE JETS COME BACK AND TAKE THE LEAD, THE DOLPHINS COME AND TIE IT UP. AND LOOK AT THIS. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS, A CALF MASSAGE A DOUBLE CALF MASSAGE FOR WAYNE CHREBET. &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU MIGHT SUSPECT THAT HE'S CRAMPING UP. &gt;&gt; EITHER THAT OR, UH, NEW YORK'S A LOT FREAKIER THAN I THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; VINNY TESTAVERDE FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THREE OF THEM CAUGHT BY PLAYERS WHO HAD NEVER SCORED. SECOND AND 4. VINNY BACKPEDALS. UNDER PRESSURE! IS IT PICKED OFF? AND WE'RE WAITING FOR A SIGNAL FROM THE OFFICIAL. AND THEY SAY NO. NO. JERRY WILSON CAME UP WITH THE FOOTBALL. BUT AFTER IT HAD HIT THE GROUND. ANOTHER LOOK. YES. IT HIT THE GROUND. &gt;&gt; GOOD CALL BY THE OFFICIALS, LATE AS IT WAS. IF TESTAVERDE HAS JUST A SECOND MORE TO THROW THIS BALL, HE'S GOT COLES WIDE OPEN IN THE END ZONE. THEY FAKED THE PLAY THEY RAN PREVIOUSLY WHEN THE DOLPHINS CALLED TIMEOUT THE QUICK SCREEN OUTSIDE TO CURTIS MARTIN. COLES FAKED THE BLOCK AND WENT DEEP. NOW VINNY'S GOT TO CALL TIMEOUT. &gt;&gt; HE CALLS A TIMEOUT. THIRD DOWN AND 4. THIS GAME IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT WAS 307 AT ONE POINT. IT IS NOW THE LONGEST GAME IN THE HISTORY OF "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL," BECAUSE IT'S FOUR HOURS, 10 MINUTES OLD. IF THE JETS WIN, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST COMEBACK IN THEIR HISTORY. IN THE HISTORY OF THE FRANCHISE. THEY ONCE ERASED A 21POINT DEFICIT. THIS ONE WOULD BE 23. IT IS THIRD DOWN AND 4 AT THE 25YARD LINE. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU BELIEVE THE DIZZYING ARRAY OF GAMES WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR, AL? &gt;&gt; INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER YOU TOLD ME IN THE FIRST GAME WE HAD SUCH A SHOOTOUT AND YOU SAID, "WE MIGHT GET ONE OF THESE A YEAR, MAYBE TWO." &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE RABBIT'S FOOT, MY MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU SURE THAT GAME WAS IN OAKLAND THAT HEIDI GAME? &gt;&gt; [ Laughing ] YES, I AM. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA BELIEVE YOU. JUST SAY IT WAS IN NEW YORK. THEY'LL BELIEVE YOU. &gt;&gt; FOR A SMALL FEE. THIRD DOWN AND 4 AT THE 25YARD LINE. THEY GIVE IT TO MARTIN. AND CURTIS TO THE 23. SO NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 40YARD FIELD GOAL FOR JOHN HALL. REMEMBER, THE LAST SNAP BY BRAD BANTA WAS BAD ON THE EXTRA POINT TO TIE IT AT 37. BUT TUPA DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF GETTING IT DOWN. HALL PUT IT JUST THROUGH THE RIGHT UPRIGHT AND NOW WILL HAVE TO DO IT FROM 40 YARDS TO CAP OFF WHAT WOULD BE AN UNBELIEVABLE COMEBACK. &gt;&gt; THE WAY THIS GAME'S GOING, I WOULDN'T BE SHOCKED IF TUPA PULLED BACK THE SNAP AND NAKEDBOOTLEGGED OUT TO THE LEFT. &gt;&gt; ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. FROM 40 YARDS. GOOD SNAP. KICK AWAY. [ CROWD CHEERING ] JETS WIN. &gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU, MOM. I LOVE YOU, DAD. &gt;&gt; START BLOWDRYING KOPPEL'S HAIR. DONE!
