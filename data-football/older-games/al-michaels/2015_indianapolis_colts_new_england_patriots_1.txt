============================================================

tonight's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by the Chevy Silverado shitty silver highstrength steel for highstrength dependability 2120 Indianapolis what's taking place over the first half tonight 20 Tom Brady 201 yards that interception that was returned by Adams for a touchdown was his first pick of the season Andrew Luck playing for the first time in three weeks he saw his numbers Gronkowski has been thrown to only once and he's been shutouts at this point Mike Adams has now picked radio up three times in his career twice last year and once tonight it was seven nothing Indy than it was ten seven New England as the second half begins there was 14 ten Indianapolis 17:14 New England and II took the lead by four and thence one at the hand quarterbacks with two great quarterbacks and they put on a show right away this fourth down throw huge to get the Colts out of the gate and then Tom Brady showing off a little bit of his mobility he really created some nice offense the one turnover the first half completely not Brady's fault none just unable to hold on to that one and now watch the spy of Jamie Collins underneath and Andrew Watkins his eyes up the field and tremendous firsthalf great quarterback with the ball to start the third quarter and they start with the first down here day me and medulla that's a gain of 11 yards one thing you just don't see a lot of is to see these guys dropping their pass rushers underneath and coverage but they're trying to take away all those in cuts that if the New England Patriots beat everybody with so they're trying to have somebody inside and sort of it inviting that to the outside now and maybe Brady has found something here too started early going back is granted for the passionate Affairs the offensive pass interference had cost himself a touchdown at the end of the half demon 25 pressure is going to come around the edge one more time watch out calmly Brady steps up gets underneath Trent Cole and makes yet another play we have seen Tom Brady and one of the differences in this game so far for him on offense is his extending plays within the pocket then able to find guys down the field find something every year to work on 16 years in this year LeGarrette Blount Deena one so many times the Patriots want to pull those guards out in front of plays but if they get tripped up they can just stymie the running back trying to make a move that time is Jackson came across we got pushed in the backfield second down and nine no cannon in the game the left tackle you get offended and as you two tackles taking it to the 40yard line only his second carry of the night but once again or the Patriots once they get in this third and five range so when you get those third down runs you see opportunity now for Tom Brady third down and six Grady goes to the right side and finally gets Gronkowski so a very quick look to the left and Ron Kowski makes his first catch of the night white Lowry is the guy that they thought was the best option for them to cover Gronkowski he's a former cornerback and yet he's a big strong guy about 215 pounds and you see him playing off most teams feel like that if you go up and bump and run Robb Kowski it is to his advantage so they're playing off of them and trying to react out Blake Lockett one miss Brady gets the snap Louis eat of about five we go to Michelle well cold safety Mike Adams is not on the field questionable with a hamstring injury he had that interception of Tom Brady in the first half he is on the sideline a towel around his neck just looking very frustrated wishing he were out there out hmm that's a big loss Michelle Colt Anderson is a great special teams guy Anderson is in the game down in Adams spot second down and five at the 25yard line you couldn't hold them back next monomers Gronkowski for the touchdown I can't even tell you what happened on that coverage completely blown there's nobody in here will know to quell Jackson was supposed to drop underneath that but had absolutely no chance that Dwight Lowry just blowing that's just wrong shredder until then Adams out of the game we mentioned that the lost their key guy in the secondary Gronkowski catches his first two passes of the game and again the Patriots pull off that's scoring at the end of the first half and scoring to begin the second half to back possessions just asking is good and about four minutes in duty another lead change is savage to Patriots on top by sex this is Sunday night Gronkowski targeted just once in the first half take a look at him through the years when he plays they average almost 33 points again highest average for any player who's played a minimum 50 G's vitamin T Smith the LA Rams back in the late 40s and early 50s would be the next highest Sunday night wouldn't be a good nickname these days I talked to Chuck Pagano at half time he likes what Andrew loves done saying he's done pretty good darn good for a guy who hasn't played for a couple of weeks we have been here before with the Patriots this time we have to finish now an update on Marcus cannon the left half before the Patriots he's been downgraded to out with that left toe injury al that had him questionable in the first half all right Thank You Michele so it'll still be Ballmer and Fleming and the Patriots who used to it mixing and matching tasting and Lloyd 20yard line Jamie Collins with the batted ball second down to ten Jamie Collins is just so nimble so many times his change of direction almost looks like the way a cornerback would do it just reading the eyes of Andrew Luck and knocking that one away I will say though that the one guy in this Colts offense that had a really nice first half was Anthony Costanzo playing against Chandler Jones he is that's a tough matchup and he's sigh but it's a bouncing bill look at that matchup Anthony Costanzo and Chandler Jones who probably their best pure pass rusher on the team and those two guys have been going out at Gaston Zoe's except arrays for doing exactly what you're seeing on the screen Sherlock has been pretty comfortable tonight his backs have done a nice job blocking and he has gotten some pressure he's escaped and made some nice plays out of it you know the offensive lineman's having a good night when he can't remember calling the name of the guy he's playing against and he's out of bounds yard line Malcolm Butler made sure he went no farther and that's going to bring in the punting group well pressure on Andrew Luck and he had to get it out of there that time he got hit right in the chops as he let that one go Pat McAfee to punt Julian Edelman that a touchdown this located his finger at least it looked like a dislocation three drops back to accept this punt last moment mr. Boyd at the 28 yard line and he says he was contacted he go for it update on some of the numbers the Colts doing a better job against New England on the ground but they've given up three 273 through the air the 342 already for New England up by six Patriots have the ball at their own 26 out there again and just looked at taken but they're going to say the play was over I'm not so sure about this one Colt Anderson came in to make the hit after Lowry was there with him Gronkowski makes another catch again elbow down wall out as the ball moving before nots good call all came out Adams Patriots making sure with the Lewis picking up three down to the 44 here's one of those rookies we're talking about Henry Anderson inside playing off that doubleteam he has made a lot of plays in the backfield for this Colts defense so far this season second and seven at the patriot forty fear tended for Dion Lewis 337 and here is what bregman husky the defensive coordinator for the Colts has been waiting for one of these third and seven plus and whatever is his best blitz coverage whatever it is this is his moment and his defense needs to get off the field you can't let this juggernaut keep rolling along crowd knows that too they stand as one seven that's incomplete Chandler looks for a flag doesn't get one Tola with very good coverage fourth down sometimes you just have to win oneonone that's all there is to it reaches around knocks that ball out a little contact which I think the hand hit the ball before it really hit one of the arms good play New England's first punt of the night Ryan Allen to receive it and it's a bad kick with the sign of his foot it squirts out of bounds up around the 24 yard line so the Kofi does its job offense takes over down by six these guys would be lifers Dick LeBeau 57 seasons on the field as a coach or a player now with the Titans dick folks um in two years with the Steelers 45 years Charlie Joyner great player coach as well 44 years course Don Shula spent 43 seasons coaching her playing Bill Belichick did not play in the National Football League 41 years in coaching and he hasn't missed any of them since he started on to Ted marchibroda from the 24 grunting holding offense number 74 first down so we're talking about a trick last night and Leon Costanza we asked him about did you ever need a break or walk away and he coach the Browns head coach before Cleveland moved to Baltimore he said at that point in 1996 I sort of did but Bill Parcells was coaching New England he brought me in to help him on the defensive side obviously that's when Bob Kraft got to know Belichick that one year then Belichick goes with Parcells to the Jets and of course Bill winds up after turning down the Jets job having it for a day with New England I think he was actually excited not to be a coordinator or a head coach and got a chance to take to the 22yard line he started with the Colts as an assistant there's some of the Baltimore Colts coaching staff for the areas with Ted marchibroda he made 25 bucks a week 22 after taxes he told us today would be about eight I tell you second down and 12 at the 22 yard line maskull once in over no shortage for my second tale outside the 40yard line bikie why Hilton for a first down so they overcome the the hold and call first down halfway through the quarter now there we go but watch Chandler Jones drop underneath this it almost went right through his hands Jones dropped an interception last week and I thought this one might have been picked off it sort of just went right between his hands from the 42 am on Bradshaw now in the game at running back fifty and a flag is down on the other side of the field away from the play illegal contact defense number 23 fiveyard penalty automatic first down Belize's Patrick Chung let's go back to that previous play here in Chandler Jones watches he drops underneath this CB he gets a hand on this think he did you can see the way that the ball started wobbling nice job by T Y Hill T in traffic stay focused and make that catch a lot of zone defense out here tonight I just I really didn't expect it I thought they were going to try and take away T Y hunting but maybe the respect of the other receivers this year so first down but isn't that the Patriots in the past whatever you expect you don't get you don't expect to get yeah and and really the the two things that they had to do differently this year they had to improve their defensive line play talking about the Colts to try and match up with this football team and they had to get better at the wide receiver position because they were able to take away twhite Hilton so they draft Phillip Dorsett they signed Andre Johnson and now they're getting a more balanced look from Matt Patricia left outside empty backfield incomplete Andre Johnson had a chance to make the catch couldn't hold on third down and nine just a little bit behind all the way inside gonna go across here and you'll see Andre Johnson slow down just a bit to give Logan Ryan a chance to get back in there well done by Logan Ryan who continues his hot play off of last week Johnson caught one ball on the opening drive and none Finch today they've got the speedster in there now Phillip Dorsett number 15 solutely fly he was their number one draft choice all the way back on the deep deep drive easily and Jo's converge for the sack and that'll make it fourth down on a mile Dominick easily with this quick first step of his is so tough for sinners who have to snap that ball look at how they've spread that out they tried to fan out but it left the centered collet Holmes oneonone and that time Easley was just too much every week you see a little bit something better out of Dominic Easley with that first step in his quickness with his fortyeight at the 10yard line bye Amendola district 2 yard kick five minutes to go on the corner here undefeated season beat cathedral 7nothing and friday night check it off underneath trying to get it to change white first time he's been in tonight polar for the beverage nice job out here you're going to have this out cut again that they hit earlier in the game but that was that trap coverage Vontae Davis rolled off of his guy Brady took a look and then stepped out of it sometimes as quarterbacks the throws you don't make are the best McGarrett walked in the backfield bassant ended therefore Keshawn Martin that makes it third down and ten with pressure right up here by the new guy ey McGill looky he got off and got in Brady's face which forced that high throw crowd again rising is one third down and ten so at the slip screen after a gain of seven by Colt Anderson taking the spot of the shaken up Mike Adams who was out to its fourth down what a huge tackle on this one I think he's right here watch Colt Anderson come up and make this play it looked like Amendola the punt returner who always makes people miss was going to end up with the first down there and that was a very special tackle by Colt Anderson and second on his first his off the side of his foot 32 yards the flag is class come around the corner what you know it's gonna be it's gonna be against the receiving team once the guy just could not help himself nope just could not help himself flying down the field clearly behind his man and just pushed him right in the back that was a 56 yard kick right there with some added yardage Buitoni crunchy gives us the call course nobody blocks Matthew Slater one of the great great special teams players in this league during the return of the kick illegal block in the back receiving team number 27 10yard penalty first down 356 left in the third quarter Patriots up 70 this drive starts at the 19yard the Patriots defensive end jabal shirt was questionable with an ankle injury we saw trainers examining his right ankle in the first half he's on the sideline no helmet and a pretty heavy tape job under that right sock out yeah and he michelle has been a significant addition and picked him up in the offseason from the Cleveland Browns leads his team in sacks and has proven what he can do inside something we really didn't do with the Browns second down and four five first down up at the 30yard line since they made the switch on this offensive line it has just been a huge difference they took Jack Newhart from right tackle moved him back in guy right here is going to make the block and then they brought back hugh thornton to play the right guard position but joe rights at right tackle we saw him last week against JJ Watt now yes he had a lot of help and all of that but he solidified that right tackle position that they used to have to leave it tied in on that side in order to pass protect no more with Wright 72 yards to the 37 yard line so Frank is not pickup 79 on 13 carries we're starting to see now the Patriots react a little bit to that running game by bringing some of the safeties down a notch and forcing him to get involved because remember one time in Andrew Luck's career is he had a hundred yard rusher and so the Patriots aren't used to seeing this out of them second and four with over two minutes to play in the third just past the line of scrimmage first two games that offensive line Chris was talking about it those were your starters the Todd Herman's coming over from Philadelphia they struggled made the change at guard you heard over two left guard Thornton the right guard rights to right tackle that was the big problem with Indy last year Chris both both lines the offensive line and the defensive warning they are better that they need to finish a game like this against the Patriots they have to stay on the field here with this third down three exploring the fascism Donte Moncrief was surrounded by a passel of white shirts in his fourth town he had it just let it sail along see Jamie Collins drift this way and it's going to lock once he scrambles the Thornton would have been a big first down you just wonder sometimes with that shoulder and you're not able to practice all those throws oh oh yeah three take the snap Anderson is behind you tell me I thought maybe they were going to try and get them to jump offsides illegal formation the whole right side of the line was not on the line of scrimmage offense this penalty is declined the result of the play is first now new there is absolutely no way possible that they should have snapped that ball and tried to stick it there were three four five guys around two players that was insane what are you doing here they don't even try to run a play i we see bizarre stuff I've never seen anything more bizarre than that what was the plan I don't know I mean two completely nuts but the 35 now search me for yard line McGarrett want nobody had any idea was going on it had to be a complete screwup I mean it's the only explanation you don't snap the ball with all these guys look at all these guys that's five on two and they didn't have enough guys on the line you have to have at least seven players on the line so they were fanned out on the right side and this is LeGarrette Blount we're in the final minute of the third quarter did I tell you the other thing it's not fair to your defense you know you get up there and in plays like that they're looking around I think Grif Whalen just said why the heck did you snap me the ball gold I didn't want that thing but it was Anderson who played the quarterback role Whelan was the snapper nobody was on the line not enough guys were on the line well just when you think you've seen law but that could be disaster at the end of the night 2721 into three and Sunday night football as wacky as it is just when you think you've seen everything Tomic man is the special team sport it's obviously that's a play that you're practice but clearly they didn't want him to snap it watch Chuck slips why'd you snap it he says second down and nine and now LeGarrette Blount will take the ball to the 20yard line setting up a third down and six exactly right I mean it just sometimes the coaches will say alright let's go out there if you get this look go ahead snap the ball there's just one guy snap the ball block in but if you don't get that look you can't snap the boat and top them up I'm gonna snap it to begin with you don't know the right number of guys on the line sediments laughter illegal formation which they were third and six and he's able to find enough space to pick up the first down at the 13 yard line it is so nice to have a guy on your team so the Tom Brady doesn't always have to throw the ball in that situation josh mcdaniels over calling the plays it was interesting here in tom talked about josh mcdaniels and how he weights up at 3 o'clock in the morning on Saturday morning to finalize the game plan so when Tom comes in he's nice and rested and we just ease his way through attention for a short game now from sometimes you get that look coming off the field we've had it several times when I played and as an offense when you make a screwup or you do something dumb or you gave up special teams play like that and that defense that's been fighting their tails off all night and getting the ball back to you here in the second half and all those things they just look at you like you said something about their family and that could take the air out of the room if the Patriots lined up in the endzone second and eight touchdown LeGarrette Blount so the trickery and deceit that went nowhere winds up on the other side as in New England touchdown and a twopossession lead I think I'm watching Aaron Rodgers tonight watch Brady step pressure to to create big plays the night when he's been under pressure and when he's been forced out of the pocket has been something we simply did not see at a Tom Brady a year ago he focused on it and he is delivering on promises right now the Garrett one and his career has 29 rushing touchdowns that is his first receiving TD this aspie adds the extra point and all of a sudden a very tight backandforth game as a 13point differential go figure go 48 to play in regular Auggie lovers like Chris and me know about Wednesday night robbery every Wednesday on NBCSN Philadelphia and Boston the Flyers and the Bruns meet in Boston this Wednesday night awesome utensil we can tell you that Sunday Night Football being brought to you by the Ford f150 every other truck is history by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL and by Geico 50 Minister City 50% on car insurance 20,000 artifacts house with the children's quite a deal here in Indianapolis here in town inde begins this draw Morrigan Jamie Collins I think scared him to death he threw it inside and Jamie Collins right here is going to be sitting right there in the space and his Moncrief came over there he looked at and just sort of collapsed but I think I lived as though another shot right there a nice job of getting T Y Hilton on the ground as well by the rookie Justin : second and ten then it's active the 60 unit Chandler Jones Silverson lingo revolt there and this was part of the problem holding offense number 76 this penalty has been declined results of the play third down so right make it third down and 14 one of the things that pep Hamilton was talking about was I have to call plays that get the ball out of Andrew Luck's hands and now that they're down he is reverting back to a little bit of what we saw early in the season when it's not there he wants to hold it and make a play flag down the team wide open 74 10yard penalty repeat third down anthony Costanzo a killer there's the matchup we've been talking about on the outside a little tug of the Jersey and little help from Chandler Jones on the call but that is a monster because that was a great play by T Y Hilton there and this this holding stuff really hurt the Colts early on I'll bet you Frank Gore had 150 yards of runs called back in the first few games of the year every time they take off and get a 10 yard or 15 yard line the change with the offensive line now it gets really tough tonight against the third and twentytwo my queen out of bounds at the 14 and now they're forced to punt down by 13 points and punting from deep in their own territory and same at Patricia's defense has done an excellent job this second half after a bit of a struggle in the first half they have come out here in the second half and delivered on every single series and then of course the big game changer yeah when you do the old fake punt whatever that thing was and this game now is starting to look a little like what some of those experts were saying about it the first part brings it back to the 44 yard line 55 yard booth living yard run back and the callup coming during the return of the kick illegal block in the back the CVT number 36 10yard penalty first down 1124 left in regulation Patriots trying to go to five and as if Tom Brady needed something else in his repertoire tonight it has been the movement skills of Tom Brady that has made the difference good initial pocket step up and throw touchdown here's the one touchdown pass why not this for a gain of eight yards now you get the ball to the closer here right and that play is something that the New England Patriots just love they love being able to get these guards out in front of the play and you don't know defensively is he going to cut up inside of Shaq Mason the most athletic guard that Josh McDaniel says he's ever coached are they gonna pop it to the outside I've seen him play big plays with both for that particular what is the closer normally but he's been the opener and closed her tonight in the past and the four games Dion Lewis has done the heavy lifting until Midway maybe through the third quarter then blunt comes in to put down the hammer but tonight and again it's what the Patriots do go against the grain so much once carry 12 times in the illness only for the two playoff games under 166 yards and seven touchdowns by Ladera that's about all you need check Mason in the backyard as a there Devane sneaking not where they're marking it it's to be just a little short and they're gonna call for the change to come in with our naked eye we think they are three linked short well that time the Colts had somebody on either side of the center so they were able to be a little bit stouter on that quarterback sneak I thought held it short so here comes the measurement and there you see a couple of inches shy fourth down and they're not going to do any favors for the Colts and give them a potential short field boot it away not very often do you see Tom Brady after a quarterback sneak on third and short walking off the field he's converted on the third and fourth and one sneaks about 85 and 90% of the time Whalen left in the fourth five and Oh taking on the Philadelphia Eagles Eagles play the Giants tomorrow night football night gets it started at seven o'clock two weeks Green Bay and invert two undefeated teams on Sunday the Cordia law scheme that with it incomplete second down and ten Harmon coming right out of the middle of the field here and then just reading the quarterback sighs he has really helped this defense a lot this year a couple interceptions already but he is that centerfielder that can go sideline the sidelines make plays like that and really has allowed Devin McCourty to become much more of a role player in the defense and take on a lot of different responsibilities fires that is Coby Fleener making the catch fish every third down now becomes very important third and three since he unbeaten wanted Buffalo today Denver pulls that an overtime win Green Bay knocks off San Diego despite 500 passing yards from Phillip Rivers Carolina won and New England trying to go to five another night and the Lions won today so there are no more winless teams as they knock off the Bears in OT great Johnson to keep the drive alive had to be right there from Andrew Luck pretty good coverage on the outside coming right at you here just enough to where Logan Ryan couldn't reach out and make that play where they needed a drive starter didn't they mmhmm just need something to get them going here big play in a while at a point when if Greenland gets the ball back they can really start to look the clock his receiver fell down on his team wide open dropped to the ground as a flag you know Joe writes who has been playing very well now the deeper into this game we go the more holy number 76 10yard penalty so Rights is right out here now I think a bitch got inside of them and got his back turned sort of pulled him towards him a little bit they started off so well with those quick releases they were hitting the head like six or seven different receivers involved both of whom and they've kind of gotten away from that a little bit here those tight ends could be really valuable to you here and a perfect now it's gone up at the 30yard line so they get a good chunk of the first and 20 back is filled up through set their number one pick out of the University of Miami as fast as they come makes the catch and we second in seven four three three guy and at the combine I think third fastest at that combine and so I'm out there with the lead people are going to give them a little extra room and some of those opportunities will be available block him by himself to the left they go three by one to the right side that's incomplete I intended for Andre Johnson third down and seven one of the reasons some of those quick passes haven't been there is number 91 Jamie Collins right here watch what happens as these crosses come across the field he's going to give Coby Fleener a shot and so that means that basically Andrew Luck has to try and find number two he has missed a few high in this game don't know if that is shoulder related or not third and seven the pressure that he goes Samuel Jones the 20yard line Chandler Jones gets the sack it's a 10yard sack he is twoandahalf tonight is fourth and 17 there's the pressure right at the line of scrimmage and once that happens basically the quarterback just has to get off of you there is no time and so that you get pressure jamming guys at the line of scrimmage and it holds up those guys just know the pressure to get there the 42 balances into the Colts bench in about the 39 yard line Patriots offense 183 in their first five games breaking the record set by the most seven Patriots a record that since been broken 182 which vo 17 as the team that went 16 at all and went into the Super Bowl with a chance for a perfect Asian hello David Tyree the Darracq what we're gain of couple up to the 44 yard line you know but for that sort of accidental pick six that Tom Brady threw that went off the hands of Julian Edelman this has been a little onesided that that play sort of kept the Colts in it in the first half and now we're back to that methodical here comes LeGarrette Blount game as they mock the clock they Trish was fired with 14 total yards Tandy's to 68 make the pick but its third down at seven Henry Anderson jumping up and knocking another he has been a tremendous asset on this football team excellent big plays against the run occasional plays against the past white a find for a third round draft pick 37 in the corner unimpeded all the way around as Al Michaels described it and then there's going to be a little Jam kasky right over the ball to make Tom Brady pull it down long enough for Lowry to get there so once again the Colts defense makes a play and gives the offense one more chance for these holding there's a flag here on a fourth and 14 flag before the snap well start offense number 36 fiveyard penalty we'll make it fourth in 19 you know there aren't many coaches really that make better adjustments and Belichick always plays them down but think of last week the Cowboys come out they have five sacks in the first half it looks like oh my gosh they can't protect Tom Brady about the second half no problem whatsoever struggling a bit defensively tonight the first half a couple of adjustments at halftime there you go taken to the turf at the 15yard line by brandon t by 13 this is Sunday night well bill belichick as usual making the right adjustments the two quarterbacks each to number 12 and Grady that has had the Colts number through the years made by Andre Johnson first down up at the 30yard line well you go back to all those great Manning Brady duels remember Payton lost his first six matchups with Tom Andrew Luck has lost his first four trying to get off that snide tonight you're set for a first down we have seen this offense explode before and it would not surprise me at all now at the bit of a hurry up here remember they went into Tennessee in the fourth quarter they were down 27 14 I think scored three touchdowns and that was when Andrew Locke hurt his shoulder during that fourth quarter so they are certainly capable of mounting a comeback here they were on the verge you going on three that's too high store said right in front of the bench no flag second intent it's just had a couple sail on him today you know it's it's not typical to see him miss hi the way that he's missing was some of these balls tonight that was an opportunity to keep that string a nice plays rolling she has some back there you see the numbers for the Colts excellent the first half and nary a point here in the secondary is incomplete Moncrief was out of bounds butler covering on the play it'll be third down that was a little much to ask that was pure double coverage with their best corner and Malcolm Butler with highlow coverage underneath them I'll tell you third and ten we almost have to consider this for down territory don't you I would the first down ten for a 25 yard game anytime you have what's called this to man coverage where you have those receivers and they're running with their back to the quarterback you see it almost every veteran quarterback knows to pull that one down and take off again this time the pass is low and incomplete intended for Coby Fleener let's say it is not easy to get off the ball if you're a tight end playing against the Patriots they sacrifice rushing the passer to make sure those tight ends take shots every time they're taking off down the field of course the tight in such a big part of this offense Dwayne Allen both had eight touchdowns for this team it's easy to go second incomplete Malcolm Butler seems to be everywhere intended for Weiland to be third down and ten can't play it a whole lot better than that much right here you'll see Butler basically run this route for Grif Whalen almost came down with course we all remember the Super Bowl the unbelievable play but I'll tell you how much respect Bill Belichick has for this guy he put him on Antonio Brown by himself and the opener you ordinarily we think right Belichick always doubleteams the best player on the other team that gaming said go get him out do it for Dorset fourth out of 10 and obviously they'll go for over three and a half to play had a easy first down and just did not see it going to do their old crossing round here he comes across the field there is that half the field he would have walked for the first down at least really is reciever stock for Ventura and the woman's going to take a telling one first hey 30second timeout it was a sixpoint game when the Colts tried this inexplicable unexplainable Kristen Pagano as I said would you snap it for I told you about all you needed to know today was interesting talking with Bill Belichick about his dad and all the college coaches that he used to hang around with and there's an offshoot of that Phil got to hang around with those guys that in the NFL basically you played a 43 defense everybody lined up and here was and all these college guys all had different plans to speak up so he got used to seeing all that crazy stuff fourth and ten the bass intended 14 windows incomplete so New England will get the ball Colts will be compelled to use their timeouts on defense and just hope to get the ball back as quickly as they can yeah just too many throws tonight just hi and that's certainly one that maybe t:y Hill had a chance to catch as well as he jumps well no he won't tell you you'll never know he's one of those warrior kind of guys but just wonder if that shoulder bothered him just enough tonight for him to miss I can think of four or five during the course of this evening that dismissed I started out sharp but then gradually the accuracy diminished patrons can use to fly what take the ball up to the 34 yard line and Indy will take a timeout so then we're gonna Patriots right now you know it's too early to start talking about an undefeated season but let's start talking about it they're gonna go to five and OH they've got their next three games and four out of five at home I mean how would you match this team up right now with the O 7 unit well I don't think they're quite as explosive as that team that had Randy Moss and of course the ability to hit all those big plays I'm not mistaken I think that was the 50 touchdown passes or whatever that year for Tom Brady and they just had the ability to scare you in so many different directions I even brought it up to Tom a little bit last night he said yeah you know not yeah that's not the same sort of he really thinks that Oh 17 was the best team in the history of football not just the history of the Patriots and he had a pretty strong argument until that final game against the Giants Giants Ernest knock them off in the last regular season took place in Arizona the lay of the game here so Bill Belichick who's been the coach of this team since 2000 talked him last night to him but about life after football him made an interesting be saying you know I've got a I got a life away from this he does he loves music please guys good golfer got a few other things going on Bob Kraft with Jonathan off his left shoulder as the era parents are running this team now we have New England taking a timeout second and nine now you've got Lombardi who won five titles two of those were Super Bowls when the Super Bowl began 66 Chuck Noll one four with Pittsburgh all in the 70s Belichick has now been to six as a head coach in one four also been to a couple as an assistant coach remember he was with the Giants back in 90 when they beat the Buffalo Bills in Tampa in the game that Scott Norwood had a chance to win at the end but was wide right that one up again LeGarrette Blount another time out here so we mentioned deflategate like four times in the road just to get that out of the way earlier got the over get me over alright so by the way the thing is not totally over because now it's gonna go to the Court of Appeals in February one of any impact on the season League of course wants to contend that they have the ability to suspend people and have it stick Brady of course not to play because judge Berman overturned the ruling before the season that guy I think mirrors America in terms of hearing about deflategate and up to the 36 yard line here what it'll be fourth down so it ain't over over but it might as well be I mean the whole league versus the Union and all that other stuff it's about power and control you know who has it the players the commissioner who gets final say on punishment all that stuff that football fans just love hearing oh yeah I just love that stuff boy we I think every time you bring up money or courts or fines or whatever you lose another football band so stay on this stay away a bit well what's good enough of it on what's better than offseason hearing Collective Bargaining 17 fighting his way back to you or goes Whalen we got another flag down we've already had 18 accepted penalties in this game and a few unaccepted Slater who's down there special teams maven son of a home Famer Jackie Slater the great gram tackled Massie good shaken up before now he's gonna need some assistance getting over the bench four straight years of the Pro Bowl as a special teamer and four straight years captain holding receiving team number 35 10yard penalty first down Matthew was hobbling over to sidelines would be a significant loss because he is the Pro Bowl guy no special teams great gunner he figures to for the Colts who need two touchdowns pass up combined three for the 32 yard line tackle about 26 of 44 now for 247 yards have to play 39 yard line that is a mod Bradshaw but Brasher cannot get out of bounds so the clock keeps on rolling remark folded Bradshaw is even playing in this game wouldn't get here Monday something like that secondly to throw that one away 2:05 and it will be third down and two this is when things get a little bit tough as a receiver trying to work downfield against eight sometimes nine guys in coverage just not a lot of gaps and say these guys remember the whole thing at the end of the year and I gotta admit I fell into this a little bit too rebus is gone Vince Wilfork and now why did rebus get out of here because he was able to cover up the field and all that sort of stuff Brown was gonna write this guy for guys who started it was Super Bowl pick up the first down and that takes us to the twominute warning with 158 officially so that much time remaining Patriots trying to stay undefeated on Sunday night and Tom Brady when he talks to Michelle after the game say now to play game that mean anything no big deal night this is the only blemish and just need he was able to work it to all his typical targets as he always does in a very workmanlike fashion tonight before it gets out of Basti why Hilton as it steps out first on the 30yard line with 152 left well we certainly have seen stranger things happen so who knows take a couple shots at the end zone here and go back to that onside kick at the the first half that appeared to be recovered by a clone that put C and replay so the Patriots got right down sport too far by Malcolm Butler second down Moncrief about a 4/4 guy and tried this double move and hey there aren't many human beings on earth that can really and stay with guys that are that fast on those double moves but Butler gave up the very early touchdown a whole lot since then second e10 Waveland was able to hold on so he makes a juggling catch that will be a first down at the 18yard line look quickly to the line snap it with 125 left Greg Weiland trying to go from go after that crazy played a hero with a touchdown here 18 yards to make it a onepossession game this is a route that takes some time to do offensive line just against threeman pass rush provides plenty of time and perfectly thrown ball there by luck so here we the National Football League is never over was all going to come down to recovering an onside kick Venna Terry to make it a sixpoint game sleeping over that push the ball of Dean Regina banj so it's plot Collins is a phenomenal athlete he was a triple jumper high jumper and he set the record at the combine right is he the one that went like 11 7 and you saw it finally pay off you say why do they do the long jump at the combine look at this we first saw this with kam chancellor I believe it was with Seattle in the playoffs maybe a year ago if he makes contact with any of those offensive linemen then I think it's a foul but since he cleared everything which of course he can do he's a quiet kid from rural Mississippi we said to him last night you ever meet Brett Farve he said yeah he said bees Plus cook his agent put him in touch with farfar says why don't you come on over and fish in my pond he said I went over any fish that they cleaned them out laying about boy so now it comes down to simply recovering an onside kick piece of New England recovers Indy can't stop the clock and the Patriots can run it out so that puts the good hands guys up front wall has to travel 10 yards or be touched by a patriot before the Colts can recover it kangaroo hawk but that'll be taken Gronkowski is out of bounds at a point 35 yard line and that's gonna that'll do it only needed it was recovery and they can run the clock out now he's so mad at himself he thought he had a touchdown on this play those up makes the play and you anticipate getting hit here he doesn't get hit and he takes off and there's nobody down there he's got a chance good there was fun talking to Tom Brady about Gronkowski and you know we were talking about the chip on the shoulder and all the deflategate and all that kind of stuff he says that Crocs not like that he just got his one of those guys he's never had a bad day in his whole life I don't think comes in never moved a couple of kneel down for landing you saw this fist pump from Belichick yep it isn't on the game for these guys but there is no love lost from the Pats and the coach we go to Michelle yeah but there have been some players lost and now it's Matthew Slater out for the game with a leg injury getting consoled by a number of his teammates on the bench medical staff looking at his right knee he appeared to be in great pain a couple of times as they looked at it so a tough game Marcus cannon also was out in this game the left tackle out yeah they paid a price they'll go home with a victory they take on the Jets next Sunday and then they have a Thursday night game in Foxborough against Miami you might like to don't mind pass along our condolences to Stephanie Infante Lindy and Fontes wife passed away former cult coach Packer coach my coach and Cincinnati great great man so much made about in a Brady and how angry he would come into the game a lot of it is just stuff because what we've known time a long time we watched him play a ton of games long has he not been ready to play and dying to win he has and he's been in the middle of these controversies and he seems to come out of the other end of them in this way by winning football games so back he goes to the locker room and then onto the plane and next week it's the Jets Volkswagen postgame report coming your way next seven the Patriot standing after Charlie by a point at the half doing live wins at 34 27 at Indianapolis the Pats are 5 and OH and the Colts are three and three here are your players of the game LeGarrette Blount carried 16 times for 93 yards including a touchdown a 38 yard he had his first touchdown catch of his career Chandler Jones also had two and a half sacks so he's one of our stars of the game and Tom Brady 23 of 37 better than 300 yards three touchdowns Brady as has been his approach this year has declined to be interviewed which means that one and Jones are the two people that Michele speaks with now down on the field look Garrett your third multi touchdown game against the Colts including your first career receiving touchdown how do you explain the success you have against Indianapolis you know great game planning by the coaches you know you know I stick to the game plan I'll do whatever they need me to do you know I succeed at it you know I just try to be the best at what I can do you know for what they need me to do your offensive line came in a little thin and then Marcus can and got injured how did they piece it together to help you guys out we got it we got a great group you know I'm office line those guys are tough you know their gritty their grimy you know and they do whatever it takes to get the job done you know who's gonna be in there you know we've been rotating guys all season so you know I know whoever's in they're gonna do a great job all right you guys have been downplaying the revenge factor all week long but how much more gratifying was this win I mean it's just like any other win you know we're playing you know we're on the right track you know but on top of that you know we got a lot of things to work on we got a lot of things to get better at so I mean we're just gonna enjoy this way right here tonight congratulations thank you let's turn to Chandler Jones who had two and a half sacks but two very different halves of football what adjustments did you guys make it halftime to keep them at bay in the second half yeah you know Andrew Luck did a tremendous job of moving the ball with his arm in with his feet and there's a few times where a guy out of the pocket and you know we just had to get to him and that was our goal late in the game you know this was a sixpoint game until on fourth down the Colts tried a trick play on special teams as you saw that going on from the sidelines what were you thinking you know I saw the formation that came out in and I wasn't sure what was going on but I thought it was a fake and there was great awareness by special teams and a hats off to our special chamber our special team coach great job in that play well now I'm gonna try it with you as well the revenge factor the plan for tom factor downplayed all week but how satisfying was this one it was a win there's another win in our win column and we run to the Jets thank you Bob all right Michelle their gritty their grimy but they stay on script that's for sure they have now beaten their once arch rivals the Indianapolis Colts seven straight times and Andrew Luck is Owen five for his young career against the Patriots since the Pats were two and two and the sky was falling last season they are 18 and two including the playoffs and their run to the Super Bowl last season
