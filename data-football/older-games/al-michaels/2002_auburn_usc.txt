============================================================

at the bender expect this thunder on the plane to the big 12 conference as Oklahoma Texas Nebraska were winners top 10 Colorado stumbles and the RAM in the country the Tennessee Volunteers in Porter State Seminoles were also winners the new boss with the Florida Gators turned out a familiar scenario and he'll go thr and the Michigan Wolverines beat the Washington Huskies in the matchup of top men he's a hero you come away tonight another pac10 team used to the hype light starts with I hope and a senior quarterback determined the graph though ring in the last goround the opposition is no rubber tree they come from the southeastern conference which could use a little good news to start this new season if pellets football 2002 is here and here are the University of Southern California Trojans massed at the tunnel who enters a Coliseum under the legendary sports stadium in all the world and so many great college football games have taken place here in this old Citadel the Coliseum was the centerpiece for two Summer Olympic Games 1930 to 1984 but it's known most of all as the home of the Southern California Trojans since the UCLA Bruins who used to share the place moved over to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and welcome to ABC's college football weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless matching the Southern California Trojan to the pac10 against the visiting Auburn Tigers of the SEC hello again and welcome to this continuing coverage of college football here on ABC Sports something we've been doing every year since 1966 and it has been our pleasure and we'd like to welcome back an old friend who has found his way home after a couple of years wandering around Dan Fouts gunner from Oregon and a great one with the San Diego Chargers he's no place I'd rather be than watching a ballgame right next to you well we've got ourselves a game today that filled with unknowns on the one hand you got the Trojan sword and over here you got the Auburn Hammer what do you think well that sort is quarterback Carson Palmer he's on the verge of becoming the statistical passing leader here at SD but that's not how they judge quarterbacks here they judge him by winning and right now he's last chance for him to live up to all the hype and expectation last chance for Carson Palmer to leave the Trojans to where they expect to be at the end of the year and that's the Rose Bowl we don't want to suggest that Auburn can't throw it but we do know they can run it with the carnera Williams their big tailback they call Carnell Cadillac because he's so smooth and powerful and while it's his moves that will wow you it's the way he finishes off runs that reminds so many Auburn fans of those great Auburn tailback he when you come up to tackle Carnell Williams you better be careful because the Cadillac will run you over and they've got a bunch of longlegged lanky freshmen that are going to be playing it wide up nobody knows what a freshman is going to do until he has done it but we think this could be a very entertaining college football game it is the end of the lazy hazy days of summer and the happy carefree times that we always enjoyed this time of year not quite the same as they used to be that thought is punctuated by the mighty strikes of the lamorne naval station here in california in that force of a tiger and the trojan now let's go to the stadium floor welcome back Todd Harris who is with us see coach Pete Carroll all right thank you deep coat the last on USC finished in the top 10 with in 1989 does this team have the ability and are they ready to get back there we're going to find out we got a heck of a schedule on the great opponent here at hope and we're going to find out one time because team we are and we're searching for that kind of promise your defensiveminded coats a lot of history AFL you've seen a lot of great safety paddles number 43 point Polamalu race tour is one of the best players I've ever coached in the next X takes in a lot of a lot of great football player oh he gets off to a great start he's really something special Thank You Samuel across it he Carroll is in his second season at USC Tommy Tuberville Omalu the man who were talking about Tommy Tuberville is starting his fourth year at Auburn he's 21 and 15 he won the Western Division of that conference mm and coach amped last year while he beat Florida two successive bowl games that came over to Auburn from Ole Miss this had been one of the coolest summers in Southern California history but when Alban arrived last Saturday so did the hundred degree temperatures but like they say it's low humidity right right the officials are packed in the referee is Gordon Reece and we're ready to play a football game at the Coliseum in Los Angeles Brian Killeen brought to us C simply for this purpose kicking off and the oven receiver goes back to the oneyard line and then back into the endzone Rodrick birthday and who it is having trouble finding anywhere to run as he gets up around the bend and moved it maybe to the 14 15 yard line so the kickoff work from Killeen and he's got him pinned deep as Daniel Cobb comes out the senior quarterback he had a battle this fall with Jason Campbell to win the start big guy sixfour twotwenty for some of the numbers on him he has overcome a lot of physical problems in order to get to this point he has a new puppet sit coordinated this year Bobby Petrino and he's very very comfortable he says so here's the first play of the ball game Auburn ball is handed off it has handed off to Carnell William who found daylight broke the play over the left side and runs it all the way up near the 40 yard line now the Alamo Rent A Car starting on it's for the Tigers as they pick up a big gain the guy they call Cadillac just carried it Williams of 202 pounds tailback they've got big fast wide outs in big tight ends the offensive fronts the tackles of both Pickers and 300 pounds that are in God or in the 290s they're big enough but they do need a little time perhaps to mill Crittenden goes at about 336 first down for Auburn getting a big play the ball is resting out at the 32 yard line if where they market where he hits the shot they go back to the same ball carrier Williams and he's across the 35 to the 36 picking up for the USC defense pretty solid group here Cody had 39 tackles last year the freshman you'd AG 35 the linebacking Bunch solid senior in the middle of that group Pollard and this is a very good solid group so not the biggest in the world the Trojans hurting some in the secondary Kevin our vet lost at cornerback broken foot all Ivalo you know about some of the Auburn fellas couldn't pronounce his name the Phil Nolan before it's over top back looking nobody throw thanks off big guy not afraid to run fumble and the veteran California project shuffled it at the Auburn 41 yard line so the Tigers turn it over as top took off had a good gain out of it but when he went down the ball came up this John Hill number five is going to be in on the play great move there by Cobb and now we've got to cover up but that ball is knocked out of there by hill you saw that right arm go in there rather middle linebacker Mike Pollard number 45 watch his shoulders and watch the elbow right on the ball and that will pop it loose before Cobb is down and the proteins come to the attack having made a break for themselves at the Auburn the 41 yard line Palmer turns and faked it Rose it back once the throw goes under these clothes of the slot fabric court by Malakal McKenzie coming out of the backfield and he'll take it down to the 26 yard line gain of 15 yards on the play the senior Carson Palmer at quarterback for the Trojan the threeyear starter given health he will be the most prolific quarterback in USC history and that's a pretty fancy fact he's already been invited to play in the eastwest Shrine game the lipo McKenzie was tackled by his own side in that time Keith Alex Holmes brought him down sushant McCullough has come into the ball game he got the pony backfield Carson Palmer stands up close quickly completes it to Mike Williams Mike Williams is a 65 210 pound freshman from Tampa Florida now the Alamo starting lineup for the prodrome the backs and receivers mail back starter is Mackenzie he had the most practice time McCullough will play along with him as you just saw Dustin Farkas will not play tonight he has a bad hamstring saving him for the regular season can't be a tailback University however without a big guy like this to open the door for you this is a key unit a change up front for the project Fred Mertz mateus is hurt and the derrick graph gets the start as they run the football with McCollum Cooper Messala one of the faster people in the state of California when he came to school here is coming out of high school in Pasadena he's a hundred and ninety pounder and he is room really quick there's no chemical it was the tailback on that play along with polite foe Mackenzie so SD like the terminology term called it they're a pony backfield and they want to use McCullough and Mackenzie and use Mackenzie has a receiver everything on the first play 14 yard line now another first down from Southern California they have to fall off on the hillside it'll go back to Mackenzie and Mackenzie will be used as a good receiver he'll go into a slob he'll do a lot of different things the Orban defensive front they return seven starters on defense gave Ratliff moved from offense to defense the linebackers very good crew here Brown in the middle he's the rock then to the end Thomas fly around all over the place and the secondary the safety is Robinson and Rose Green played corner last year and his figures the Trojans will set some beef and probably soon as Don Terry is Thomas right there and he's get a hundred and twenty two tackles a year ago here they go inside they found us the Korean deli bring Kelly in the slot right here on the read by the quarterback the flit by the linebacker Dansby as Palmer was all over that got the plant and then an outstanding effort by Kelly that swiped into the end zone once then to be vacated Kelly had a pretty easy er up didn't he he sure did here's the prideful points by David Davis and that is good and so the Southern California so Jones at 1205 to go in the first quarter of play go 41 yards five plays catch in a turnover and lead seven to Dundee Palestine Oklahoma Saturday 3:30 Eastern on ABC the Trojans needed a minute 56 seconds they use the pass more than the run on that play but it was cops fumble that gave the proteins the opportunity and here is the touchdown as Green Kelly comes off the slot position breaks the tackle it goes into the end zone and it's 7 nothing Southern California take the tackle of Mark Brown the middle linebacker and strong safety junior Rose Green couple of tough tacklers Kelly made it look easy alright here's that I am killing kicking off another Norco California rod retorted the deep man for the almond pie of the yard people being drawn and he's coming takes away from the first man got to speed across the plenty out to about the 23 yard line before del ruido captained by the Richardson program out of half an hour per game in game solutions keep Auburn thinks they can rush for 170 yards or more in fact the running back coach Eddie gran thinks it 200 is attainable their inexperience wide receivers must win the battle against the inexperience of the SD cornerback and they're going to try and find out calm carson palmer's weaknesses well they know one thing if they blitz them on the linebacker like that and they don't cover better in the secondary Palmer will find that wide open receiver Auburn comes to the attack now and they send three true freshmen onto the field and the referee Gordon Reese stops to play for a moment here wanted to talk to Walt wolf the umpire a start offense fiveyard four previous pot still first out so the Tigers having a little trouble getting untracked here a long way from home to open the season they're playing five games in the month of September that's a lot or Amish urdu is in there's a wide out so it's Abba Manu and Anthony mix he's six foot five 234 pounds that's pretty good size for a white out so Bobby Petrino the new offensive coordinator sending a different look out on the field for this second series and a cop turns around pieced the ball rolls it out yet the block gets up to the 20 and he's knocked down double yards short of the line of scrimmage as Troy Polamalu comes over and locks his legs great tackle by Polamalu because he was being blocked by tight end Robert Johnson Cobb pointed pointed out to here's full tomorrow right here and there's Johnson number 87 coming out now watch Cobb point to John say block number 43 right here well Polamalu is too quick and too accurate with the tackle so a Miss tackle on this block results in a tackle and a twoyard loss and back goes top pocket project and it is incomplete the pass was intended for over mono it was in perfect and pretty easy to distract the young teenage freshman at that particular point when he is surrounded by people trying to take his head off this is a an attack style of defense that Pete Carroll has the key is pull em all allamerican last year bidding to become another one of the SD great strong safety his ability to play different positions is key they say with the same alignment three crew freshman in there's white out shotgun formation now has topped up back he's 6 for he can see over the fact ball thrown hard down the middle past the 30yard line is very close to her first hand and caught by hobo Manu but I think he's a yard short of his first down well oh boo mono is a freshman a true freshman and that day through freshmen through mistakes not getting enough yardage with the hook route over the middle he pushes through dodi crosses over the middle and it's going to come up about a yard short so they're going to have to go for it here bull is this a risk guess who's going to get the ball I'll be number 20 for the Cadillac if he doesn't I'll fall out of a chair Crozier's almost jump I think the idea for hamsters to try to get them to jump but they don't do it and now cough comes off the center staff and called the timeout though they were just trying to tease the Trojans into jumping offside but they couldn't get it and the time is out with approaches leading 7 to nothing the open Tigers will go to the putt right here and that can be a considered risk against USD especially number 43 Troy Polamalu has got four blocks and whether he comes close or whether he's blocked one the key thing is here to put pressure on their dinner also Damon Duval is a three step hunter who has been known to bobble at snapper to Kareem Kelly is waiting for it to ball is way back there he's got a lot of room but he uses a lot of it in taking three steps no pressure on him it is the beauty oh my goodness is the beauty Kelly backed up on the ball goes into the end zone on one bow he kicked that ball inside his own 20yard line officially at 69 yards he staged the pigeons away with that one is that ABC Sports presentation of college football is brought to you by Keystone like always smooth parties happen Nivea for men aftershave balm more evolved skincare Chevy the cars you can depend on the cars that last will be there and AT&amp;T welcome to my AT&amp;T Wireless from the 20yard line USC ball they lead seven to nothing first quarter and the ball off to Suppan McCullough and the Tigers react to him and bring him that he might have a yard on it might have less than them take a look at our Burger King game solutions Etsy must stay healthy way too many injuries to their running backs last year they want to attack the new safeties for Auburn both Robinson and Rose Greene our former corners and they want to give that Cadillac a flat tire Cadillac got a great start with a 17yard run on his first carry but they never went back to him in the last Theory grant Maddox has come in at a receiver position for USC he is a possession receiver he's a good wood single back homer and the ball off and good movement in traffic by muscala will get everyone from 25 to the 26 McCullough's got more speed than anybody has never played here at USD so what he hasn't had in the past is the ability was just all right there make that first tackler miss with a nice move and indoor endurance is so important and you're running back but the linebackers these days are like buckshot coming out of a pin gauge you know they're going to get an answer you sooner or later you got three guys with shotguns over there against them today at Kelly and motion Palmer little bit of boo the lefty gets the pass away and it is intercepted by Carlos tens be the pressure came from Carlos Rogers the pass was away and that was a linebacker that intercepted that ball folks went Kelly went in motion that allowed Carlos Rogers number 14 a free shot on the quarterback what did Kelly top of the screen well that was Rogers man now his man is number three and he hits them perfectly and how about this interception the hit by the quarter and now the interception by the linebacker and over and owns the football first down at the Southern California 23 yard line then B is a big guys dick for about 2:30 a boy is deep cops single back William changing the play gives it the Carnell William got a crack he's alone he's gone touchdown others Lorenzo's ammonite in give him some help to take it free but this guy can really move it przemek 23 yards on the carry a lot of tailbacks used a lot of moves and jump outside but what we saw with the Cadillac that time all those moves were designed for one thing to get them in the end zone as quickly as possible I think cover bill got word the Petrino that hey we didn't give him the ball that last theory let's give the ball each team is not burned to turn over into a touchdown Auburn prized for the boy Duvall good he hit a 62yard around here warming up with the wind at his back carbon came into town on Saturday it is cooler tonight at the Coliseum than 100 percent 100 degree day single back is Williams number 24 and as he hits his left side the blocking is excellent but he sets up his blocks well and now the bumps is off one or two and the sharp cuts the flashing style of Carnell Williams get them thick check it out in real speed just how fast these moves are not only the moves with the power so we're all even at 77 here in the first quarter of play with eight half minutes to go Albarn will give it away now from the 35 yard line and William just having a chat scoring drive only one play for 23 yards but that old thing was set up by pressure and the great play by then before the interception McCullough and the Herschel Dennis Sheriff running backs Dennis is a freshman tailback out of Long Beach Poly they think he is going to be special if the low bouncing kick picks up back there on the 4 yard line by McCulloch protract governor field times enough to get him out to about the 24 yard line here's some of the happening Juke ending it's the losing streak happy times in Durham Colorado was upset again by Colorado State they don't have too much luck in opening games Michigan beats Washington in what Rick Neuheisel calls one of the great brain camp crime or cramps of the season it got the decade and Tyrone Willingham got his first coaching wind at Notre Dame against Maryland first down from the 24 yard line fastest thrown a little bit behind the receiver but it's still good for the first down and for Williams he 6 5 to 10 freshman out of Tampa Florida he's a big strong youngster and very settled for one so young he just trucked the ball away and muscled his way with the first down and he was battling a left ankle injury earlier this week looked totally healthy now he could be a big part of the fast offenses he will alternate with Kareem Kelly Kelly in the game now and the ball sits at the 32 yard line or it's the first down Palmer throwing gets it outside it goes to Brendan hen Cocteau has come into the ballgame as the bull back and is another freshman out of Breslow and he is out post to the 40yard line there's the top 25 coaches poll of after the happenings except for this game all the other games being early Junya Tech had a pretty good sized win over LSU and USD jumped all the way from 19 to 16 leaping right over there next reported Colorado Palmer turns and gives the ball away to the life of McKenzie and it's Mackenzie being him then has been riding to mind some slant room and get out across the 45 yard line but nothing doing funny orbit defense very good always has been I can never remember or burned up in pretty good they really have a good set of linebackers in Danby comics and Brown we've already seen dansby's athletic ability with that interception that time Thomas came over and delivered the big hit they got a couple of corners who are playing thing to do but so far as he has not tested them on 3rd down almost after drops off underneath it is McKinsey with the top boy the close to his berth down injustice depends on the market and looks like they're marking him at the 46 he needed to go to the 47 it's Carlos addendum to be making the tackle again for Overton this is as good a group of linebackers is SD will probably see all year there's beef and athleticism he is what kept McKenzie from picking up that first down and Tom Malone comes in to do the funding he is a new freshman from Lake Elsinore California this will be his first collegiate punt and he replaces Mike MacGillivray who left after more years of money here at Southern California so Tom Malone it is the head of the man waiting for his Roderick hood dish alone did not get all of it but it's a taildragger and it won't go down but the yield is go sideways and goes out of bounds who offered and gets a break there that ball get dragged it's fail it goes all the way down inside the pen but it's out and the 20 to 30 excuse me first down 32 yard this is ABC's solid football holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless at a tie ballgame at 5:56 to go in the first quarter of play at the Los Angeles Coliseum and the Auburn Tigers will go to work after a 32 yard punt that went out of bounds on the Auburn 22 yard line and you'll Copsey as Ronnie Brown set behind him and top stands out at the air and it is incomplete the man was completely covered the ball was intended for Silas Daniel he was the only man on that side of the field and Roy and Ron none who has come here from San Mateo California came as out of City College handled him well and none he does a good job here but this is poorly thrown ball too low tough adjustment for Silas Daniel try his dive for that ball on that fade round you want that ball up in the air over the outside shoulder good look the other way out a couple of men on this side reveal from the 22 second down and then they'll run it this time with Ronnie Brown and brown is in at 217 pounds about more from Cartersville Georgia will get out to about the 26 bottle could be nozomi beat before the game at the only time that Cornell Williams will not be in the game is when he needs a blow when he's tired guys got 44 yards in just three carries so he's being Ronnie Brown now giving him a that load Chris Butler is another tailback list is number two even when it came from the breast and is another question about a Venice Florida they'd like you to watch there's an and six and top which time throws high down the middle of the past again completely honest man wide open Marcell Willis was wide open then the ball just sailed away on tops throw an Auburn we'll have some fun yeah the 24year old six year senior was not a whole lot of experience got happy feet that time the pressure forced him to move around in the pocket mantoman coverage in the secondary over true wide open receiver Duval punting and Kelly waiting for us see who balled first pots remember was a 69 yarder he didn't get all of this one and it to like supposin but go straight sideways we goes out of bounds Matta Mountain than 35 yard line Tommy Tuberville yesterday in conversation at this comment about this line backing group that we've been talking about we have real good linebackers and one year at Miami had Jessie Armstead Darren Smith Michael Berra and Ray Lewis Rohan Marley and I compared these linebackers to those guys folks that's pretty fancy company yeah they're intelligent players they've got experience and then you put them in these athletic bodies dig for 240 and they run that's why they're so highly thought of fights ever built Almer rolls out get your sass away to the sideline and Mike Williams as the ball ricochet away you almost wonder if the Sun was in his eyes as it starts to set over the top of the stadium but that ball hit him right in the shoulder back to the huddle the quarterback that egg going to cut that with your eyes closed next time I'll hit you right in the mask with it the fine throw by Palmer on the run cornerback flipped down and they were wide open Mike Williams just with a flat drop Mackenzie and McCulloch in the backfield as Mackenzie goes in motion and he's now white out and gets the ball quickly and they get it to him and they've got the first down and Mackenzie they could across midfield all the way down to the Auburn 44 yard line I blame a lot to Mackenzie total bust by the Auburn defense nobody went with Mackenzie when he went in most men fill with koolaid junior rose Green tried to go out and pick them up but what carry culprit will come down number 80 green he's going to pick to the inside here two men go on the inside nobody goes out to Mackenzie's huge play for the Trojans you got that old craftsman sitting up here column two plays for Southern California and Norm Chow it's all about mismatches you move people around put your athletes out in faith and let them play mackynzie again coming in motion this time with the lights that Palmer goes down the middle with it too high hearing Cobert and when you talk to Palmer about receivers this is the fella he talks about Yuriko Burt he had it he was in front of the defender and Palmer through a coup just the case of rushing your throw he made a good read it's at the top of the screen far side of the field Mike Williams was double covered Palmer's saw that he whips around and it throws this ball too high for Kolbert or that might have been a touchdown for epi they try the left side of the line and there's a button there McCullough brought down by DeMarco McNeill Norm Chow like most offensive coordinators will tell you that we want to establish the run and then go from there they're serious to hear him and Pete Carroll talk about their quarterback in Carson Palmer here is norm right here and how they want to take pressure off late way to take pressure off him to establish a strong running game rose again hi and it is incomplete and the project will have to put it now Greg a hunter was the intended receiver I think that was the case of Garson being too close to the line of scrimmage and then overthrowing a guy in the tight end right here over the middle Greg Gunther who is six eight but again Carlos Rogers at six one came up and forced the tide for overthetop putts away this will go deep into the end zone beyond the field of play come out to the 20yard line very little angle on the kick he just killed it commanded it will be albans of all first down at the 20 the matter for the Indy Racing Championship estate that's dramatically just one point separating teammates gil de ferran and Helio Castroneves the race Court race Sunday will come down to the Chicagoland Speedway for the Delphi Indy 300 that we live at 1:00 Eastern 10:00 Pacific time on ABC arvin from the 20 and parnell Williams is back in there as tailback and he's got the ball they get a sea serpent in the backfield slow him down and make him down at the 20yard line it was Omar nasal that grabbed him by the arm and he was gone Harris Andy Fletcher for the University of Southern California is out of the game right now and they're checking for a possible concussion probably won't know more until halftime kids with you Thank You Todd second down and ten from the 20 Williams begin a goodfaith carries out the fake give top time finds the receiver first down or burn up at the 37 38 yard line Robert Johnson tied in he's another big one six six 270 pounds all these ideas look like tackle well this part of it doesn't eat because he's going to jump right over the top of number 43 Troy Polamalu is a great fake by both Williams and job good hand ping there watch this move by a guy and you said mix mix to 70 so put the ball at the 38 yard line first down and the 77 ballgame first quarter of play look at this kid run in front I mean he is so coming I just bounce the middle linebacker Mike Pollard right on his wallet DeSean Hill and pull Imam who finally bring him down collars came over and flared up in the hole and Carnell williams dropped his shoulder you don't knock many no linebackers backwards but Williams did that time well he broke the collarbone last year with that kind of unwillingness to yield sometimes you can be overly aggressive but this is a got the beginnings of being a terrific colleague running back woody the one that I saw last year I thought that ran with this kind of quickness in traffic was tortoise running back from Miami he was like that yeah he didn't have the power I don't think this fella head I played with James Brooks in San Diego for a couple of years the great offered running back is what JB did so well the attack the tackler and again that's not any old tackler that's Troy Polamalu when he said not his wallet all is on the 45 yard line now and it is third down and three they're blowing and it's caught and it's on the truck for the first down I love schedules and a penalty flag is that he's out of bounds at about the 49 yard line let's peels off the flag there personal foul against desi late in the whistle blew because receivers clearly out of bounds sometimes these linebackers don't hear that whistle when they're running fullspeed the rest of the official umpires won't wolf spread Jim Rainey is the headline personal foul defense 15 yards from the end of the run Gordon very quickly and Matt Gilchrist field Judge Larry Farina site judgment back to us Kerala for Dallas Daniels is trying to stay in bounds after this catch that left foot will step out of bounds and there's the late hit by father it was really late you know the linebacker he's ran about 50 yards to get that link they she's going to pull off push the ball down on the Southern California 36 yard line with a minute and two seconds to go in the first quarter of play Auburn gets in positions as what's important on the pro board rate this high as job comes back and throws down the middle wallet put by pilus Kenya first down over Southern California 18 yard line that was a heck of a catch by Silas Daniel's because Pollard flashed right in front of him it looked like Pollard might have even got a fingertip on that ball to change his flight callers knows he should have picked this one off so watch this ball he did get a hand on it what a catch by Daniel the poor out of Jacksonville Florida so here's our burn on the move first down toward them place the red close to the 18th that's where the official floral put it while they banded off to number 24 that Pharrell Williams and over the left side didn't find much daylight that night Pollard's there and so is Omar nasal talked about how William broke his collarbone against the tide well what he did before that and tonight is off to a great start over 50 yards in just seven carry this is Larry becomes though dangerous they can fake the ball to Williams and run these bootlegs and the first quarter time is gone it the 7/7 I after one ABC sports presentation to the college football returns after this message and the worst gimme min introducing pcs vision from Sprint clearly a whole new way to look at wire here's our Verna as we go to the second quarter of play sitting second down and 10 at the Southern California 18 yard line 4 is 7 7 Brogan's testing a turnover for first Auburn came back from the great interception that made a touchdown out of that one now this is the first sustained drive by either feed really that we've had in the ball game but sustained only to the 18 yard line Williams is back at the back field top is in the shotgun which will you is rolling through it when you video tested oh what a bad pass through it like the whole Martinez L who was between him and Darnell Williams we didn't put any air under the ball and they turned it over for a second time I'm not fear says L was on a zone pad drop or just reading the fact that Williams was swinging out of the backfield this is a heck of a play by ho Martinez L not only did he read it correctly he executed the interception perfectly here's Maisel right here the swing pass comes out to the outside here and watch these notes just fall off poor decisions even if that ball is completed to William there were Trojans all over the place sometimes as a quarterback you make up your mind especially when you got such a weapon as the Cadillac and so the Trojans dodged a bullet they bring it out to the 40 yard line for a first down Palmer looking beef goes underneath and close it very hard and it bounces off of Fury Colburn Tolbert knew he had some room to run to the short route only about four or five yards down the field but that ball has some steam on it he looked deep though and I think that's really the first time that the farmers had an idea going down but he didn't do it you would expect the type of turnaround from a Pete Carroll who is a defensive minded head coach this is a well coached football team the USC Trojans as overt moving a little bit orbit going blitz and they come hard and they make the play no they don't either it is Mike Williams making the catch as Palmer with a beautiful fake and the life of McKinsey threw a heck of a block to keep the play alive and Sioux Tigers hit the the would be carrier and took him down in the meantime Palmer's working for 25 yard this is why my life will Mackenzie is de starting back watch him pick up junior Rose green number four with an outstanding crushing pass block local wacko out on the numbers then Palmer very calmly knew he had extra time delivered a good path to William and it's another first down for USC at the open 35 yard line now the pro gens of threatening Carson Palmer looks he goes to the end zone incomplete intended for fury Coleridge always thrown out of bounds the mark Brown came in and smacked Carson Palmer has the ball over the way there is this is going to be the long path Roderick hood with good coverage there on the double move ball thrown too far but it's because of the pressure by Mark Brown great effort here goes over see almost right on the top when the ball came down though it's second down and ten that's mackynzie in motion meet dr. ball it turned the corner pursuit very good hood and brown mark brown the middle backer for the Auburn Tigers he's not the most active of the three linebackers but he covers a pretty good chunk of real estate himself back to back displaced by Brown pressure on the quarterback on the previous play announcer yes he's going to make a lot of money trying to go wide against the speed of these Auburn linebacker tonight well there's one thing that seems to always characterize the defense of Southeastern Conference football games and its feet over half is the way got a man all is talk but it's going to be short of the first down Doreen Kelly came back to get the ball and he when he came back he was a yard or so short of the first down marker Carlos Rutgers pretty good play there for over here they are hooked up on the outside and Kelly's going to push down and right now if the ball is thrown on time we've got the first down but he's got to come back to it to prevent the interception and that's also presented the first down solid tackle by Rossi fourth and one where's Sam setting him on the guidelines in civilian clothes source an and one virgins are going and McKinsey is in the backfield with Carson Palmer farmers on the throw throw to the left side panted Park by Grant metal and metal is not a mound which lies a 15 first down USC Rose Green knocked him out about one of those mud sprouts where you put three receivers in a small area and you run basically a kick play a team battles running off the route of Mike Williams on the inside and offers just did not respond in time here they are the bunt route right here and Rose screen is too late to come out to the outside confusion in the Auburn secondary so the fourth down play pays off for the first down and here the Trojans threatening they turn and give the ball for Susana McCullough McCullough's inside the 5yard line running with power getting a great block from dick of Rogers to get into that point and with SD alternating between McCullough and McKenzie they are both fresh and they're both being very productive here in the first half you will not see Justin Farkas Dena she is still having trouble with that the hamstring and you see that USC did not won the bowl well last year averaging just about 88 yards per game he's winning effect in doing that or anywhere else no second down all inside the five it's McCulloch touchdown so the offensive cross goes some Authority and Penta can graph opened up the middle of the line and McCulloch school and it is we really got to give some credit to that offensive line they're an experienced group and not necessarily one that has a lot of scars on it their pass blocking well and that run for a touchdown was the walkin by McCullough 1204 to play in the first half here's the porch drive by Davis it's good so the Trojans convert another Auburn turnover into a touchdown both CD the promo turnovers at USC lead 147 it's 147 ballgame at 12:04 to go on the firsthalf Southern California leading Auburn Omar days L has the key play in that last possession intercepting that short pass of Daniel Cobb to stave off the Tigers drive and give the Trojans some fuel Lyon Killeen we'll ticket for us be a Bigfoot knocked it down to Lapras Hooda the little breeze coming from that direction the vault segment on the four yard line by hood and hood will hit this all said about the 23 24 yard line a couple of turnovers for our Pacific Life game summary the interception by Carlos Dansby that is this 23 art beauty by carnal Cadillac Williams at side to torque 7 and then home rnase del with a Kip please do this free art plugs by Fulton McCulloch 147 produce ball is off the 23 first down for Auburn compact starting and saying its quarterback won the job he'll stay there using a lot of fresh people Lloyd quite warm well is taken by Cornell Williams and he bounces outside to miss the first tackle second cycle and he comes too close to the 40yard line and it'll be an Auburn 1st down and this is what his quarterback Daniel Cobb says about this big running back I'm really friends with the way he rode balls for is his emotions and his effort in his heart and I think that rubs off on those offensive lineman when they see him battling for the extra 2 or 3 yards after two guys hit him I just kind of think it listed lifts their spirits and make them want to go out block even harder first down at the 39 yard line for the Tigers and Tufts past is now the sidelines got a man out there passes court by 17 barometer do a Roma sure do from Miami Springs Florida just simply outran the defender and the pass was right off the money best pass of the game for Daniel table or it's with the playaction fake that fake to Williams on the draw gave him time to throw he could really step into this throw and he puts it right on the money Romo Judy was behind the defensive back there for SD and offered to break right back Ronald none with the man yacht Randall Arnold it getting that's finally and kept him from scoring the ball is at the 18 yard line first down or the Tigers they're into just gonna toss gives the ball the Williams Williams turns back into the middle and it's I mean you better get a hold of his handle because you're just not going to arm tackle it he should have been down around the line of scrimmage get around the big enough a month for years now time for the Aflac trivia question and the question this week which of these two schools have the most recent allamerican running backs and who was or there's a lot of great choices in that question SD and Auburn and second down call it eight shorty top still got it rose it Those is very hard and a tight end Cooper Wallace could not reel it in and I think I think that suggestion of the Sun being a problem when you look back into it might have been involved in that yeah if the shadows are extremely long the shadows are starting to creep over the top here and spread out over the field but they're in perfect alignment you look at these the receiver coming across here it's looking right down into that Sun and that was another high hard one from a quarterback there's domination bitches the Williams era lined up strong like Connor Williams goes inside the pen and he's close to the 8 yard line you almost picked your poison when you try to tackle this young man because if you are there in good position he'll either bounce you on your back girl make a move and embarrass you third in eight and they choices the play is to go wide and let's Parnell William run over SD tacklers they were lined up from right and that's where he went and he is one yard short of the first down the orbit on fourth and one is going USC lady 14 to 7 William flipping he flip and he drove into the line not just the question of the market he didn't have to get all the way to the 8th he was flipping but he'd never lost his balance Keith I think he got close enough obviously for the measurement but I think he got the first down here there's the slip but there's the dive Melvin Simmons covers them up this is a very firm turf that playing on real grass then hot and dry around these forks he did not get only did he did not get the first down the ball was placed on the 9 yard line exactly and Pete Carroll is a happiest I've found right now any time the defense can make a play like that it eventually against the back like that keep that slip obviously caught them yeah he didn't have full power he was trying to bounce to the left get outside just a bit and that slip law cost him is he's powered so the Trojans again dodged a bullet has Auburn's turned away downfield and USC first down from its own nine yard line over Sam and emotion carson palmer rolling out get this half away passes over the sidelines from the region le it is short of a first down but it's good food foot of the bowl nursing bombers having a great first after the play selection is allowing him to use his mobility la to roll out a lot of bootleg a lot of production the one interception that shows there was a spectacular play by Carlos 10 to be second down and one for USC and he's got the birds out Rob roderick hood make the tackle for over there been a lot of running backs around this campus Southern California Mike Garrett who's now the athletic director of OJ Simpson of course and Anthony Davis Charles white Marcus Allen Rickey Bell so many of them known as tailback you but it hasn't been that lately here's the pitch to Mackenzie Mackenzie aim is 60year like Daniel calm would turn it up to about the 25yard line that's a picked up close to three if anybody if any of those great running backs will tell you that it starts with that offensive line Etsy has had a lot of great offensive linemen about great running backs how about these guys gave well it was Tucker Frederickson and Joe crib then the fella you know so well James Brooks and played for the Chargers bo Jackson and Britt Fullwood Benelux and this fellow Williams is going to be right in company with these guys for the time he's on after cut back coming back inside for Mackenzie that 245 pounds the junior had a rough year last year a lot of trouble a lot of injuries us is that all kind of thing and now in fact the NCAA gave him the sixth year and now he's back to have his senior season and it's still vital to this office because of its versatility to line up to the wide receiver in the slot play the tailback position we've seen out well we passed lots to work in June McCulloch both of the backfield right now for the proteins on third down and five buhburn little shortstaffed has after all by himself the Auburn beef it broke down completely and McGinty went out of the backfield nobody covered him and he's still going all the way down to the Harvard 36 yard line and again it's confusion by the Auburn Tigers secondary it's about three or four times tonight we've seen an empty wide receiver or tailback come out of the backfield and not be covered the action goes away but at the straight drop back pass to Auburn defenders go with the wide receiver and wide is the key word here because that is what Mackenzie was as in open 37 yards on the play the Packers have a huge defensive coordinator Gene Chizik and you know when you when you put in to new coordinator you're putting in new vernacular you're putting in terminology at this and that and changing things some and it takes you a while to get used to it takes you a while to gel and put it all together yeah and they're going up against the veteran team you know Mackenzie McCullough and Palmer and this is the second year of norm Chows offense it ain't Mali punched X I'll tell you that where is malli plucks it oh it's out there down the road down yonder it's up there near ten months then my Laura Ghana Lord Polamalu's help out time out one of our officials got injured on the play therefore we're going six man no my goodness I didn't see that you know I know this type of long run those past plays the referees er officials are running down the field as well they sometimes get caught up in the watch this is a good crew this is a very good crew of officials I think 36 yard line first down for USC Palmer wanted to go quickly to advance also Arbitron throws the ball is intercepted then oh my goodness Jr Road green the intended receiver Mike Williams broke free when the defender absolutely fell down and was nobody around him in the ball field on Palmer and it was picked off it actually went right to Rose green with Palmer didn't do your penis read the coverage that's right helpful covers his row screen came over and got the pick all he had to do was keep it down and he's got a maybe six daddy gets the turnover interception by jr. Oh screen is set up by Carson Palmer not seeing the double coverage there goes Carlos Rogers trying to hold William and now if Palmer throws that ball on the line he's got a big play but he thought saw the corner fall down he thought he could lock the ball and get a touchdown but junior rose green red his eyes picked it off and Auburn will start first down from their own nine yard line so both teams now have two turnovers and Ronnie Brown is the running back for the Tigers they'll background has it bounces outside and gets it up to the 19 yard line where Deshawn Hill makes the tackle Brown 217 pounder making the second appearance of the ball game we've not seen Bruce Buffer nor Trey Smith as yet the other two running backs and by bringing over mano to the outside watch how it affects the defenders on the weak side they see the reverse coming and now Ronnie Brown is right by nacelles with a big game first down off the 19 yard line here's proud again just hounds in there a little no bone good ball it was Walt wolf the official vault has pulled a muscle and walk is the numpy so here he had the toughest job out there if he has to line up behind the defensive line and look for holding and all those intricate moves those offensive line and the defensive guys go through now you've got a substitute going in there who's not used to playing and I've heard you think you've never been there whoa go in one place worse and that's being a quarterback and being in the pocket deliver he's lined up he's not even you see to be up tighter Jim Rennie is the brave man who stepped into that position all burned again tries to stay inside with Ronnie Brown and they ain't going to get a whole lot of real estate running in that territory earlier we asked you the Aflac trivia question which of these two schools at the most recent allamerican running back and who was he the answer is Auburn it was Brett Fullwood in 1986 so I think perhaps that'll in some definitions and some of the travail that's existed at USC I'm trying to get a running game that is consistent and lasting out of the shotgun now job gets the heat stock goes down at the 15 yard line is Melvin villains that that linebacker comes whistling in and makes the tackle seven cents per the USB from Washington State that out a year and here he is that's the first act of the evening number 51 coming from the weak side here and again there's nobody there to pick them up that the bus on that offensive line and here comes a bamboo ball they need a big room here to get them out of trouble waiting for his Karim Kelly killers gotta look up right into the front to build the punt the beauty by Holden get that football Kelly handles it alright and turns up field now he's got some room and gums after the 40yard line he was tracked down by number six for Auburn Horace bullish otherwise he might still be running 62 yards but a 17 yard return and USC has the ball you're watching ABC Sports championship television well Pete Carroll looks pretty calm right now but he was a little hot a few seconds ago because the Southern California Trojans have been hit with a penalty flag for having 12 men on the field when our burn commit so as the result of 12 men on the field at the 15yard penalty the Auburn Tigers will get a first down out of the call and we'll all the football up at the 30yard line so instead of USC having the ball at their own 40 with four minutes and 14 seconds to play it's Auburn and here the pilots / before the game that mark pressman he with the putter on the program football team in the late eighties he's flying the Rockets that f18 those are the guys the Todd Harris would try to talk to we have some time Saturday the southeastern conference big 12 hours will bang his in Norman Oklahoma it is Alabama and Oklahoma at 3:30 Eastern 12:30 Pacific here on ABC sports that last for college football or those those two guys hold a wagon full of history don't think Oklahoma and ala bama I just like to hear you say both those schools names NL Williams is back into the lineup now has offer just a big break and here's some brilliant of turning upfield and goes to the forty and he's on the first down marker as Polly wolly makes the tackle I think yes he's going to get a steady diet of number 24 although that tackle really hooked up Williams and now he's got a bad ankle Paul Amato 43 is going to come over and slam him down after he gets off the block of Johnson ear but check out the anklets pinned down underneath them Ronnie Brown comes on to the field to replace him as we didn't brought off the field so the printer can have a look at him he's sitting down and started to work for him ball is pitched to brown brown or runs into one of his own men and finds a little bit of daylight and picks up about three yards on the sidelines Brown looks like a clone of Cornell Williams did not choose to go out of bounds on that play but lowered his shoulder and got extra yards straight ahead the trainer's in the medical folks are having a look at Carnera Williams be standing up now in front of the fanned and getting a good drink of water it's a kind of day where you can get dehydrated here's you see what happened is ankle get caught caught by dis Ron Hill we stake to come it open second down and seven for Auburn and white is it brown brown bounces outside goes back inside and he's got a first down means likely looks so much like William with the sharp cuts the slashing type of run and also always heading down the field when he gets tackled good onetwo punch for the Tigers they said they want they thought they could get 170 Eddie gran who is the running back coach for Auburn thought the 200 was a reasonable goal for tonight's game well then we shall know down there's anything evolve it's the first down for the Tigers that's a Trojan 46 stop looking around has time bros ballers court and just at the 40yard line for silent nu number 85 here's thought Harris alright Keith will the Cadillac wasn't a little low on cash you got right now bad cramp for the trying to get some surgery some fluids into minted to hold him up a little longer but he's almost ready to go hey thank you sir you know Keith Bernie Williams did not scrimmage you very much if at all we're all burning throughout the summer twoadays is nothing quite like game action and I think the cramps are result of that being his first action it's second down and four if your Brown bouncing around they take him down right off the 40yard line and give him a little bit inside Polamalu again along with Mike Patterson Patterson to sophomore 285 pound lineman out of Los Alamitos California Arnel Williams is back see that Auburn has two timeouts remember they tried they had to burn one in the first quarter when they tried to draw RSC offside 215 to go in the first half 14 to 7 so gently this is William I want to tell you there's a couple of submissions down there I mean they were right in the middle of the flesh description and it's pumped it out I'm not telling straight no step of the Valvoline amp I'm Joe a look at the great tradition that the Alabama and Oklahoma football programs we have an NFL conversation for you are you ready for some football and our first half highlights from the 33 first down for the Tigers minutes 39 to go puts path to the outside 29 yard line crossed by Willis and he's wrestled down in a hurry by barrel road overdose only by eight and then Jill six footer but barrel got the jump down and if you this field starts to shrink you start thinking about put the ball up in the end zone and get let me small Auburn wide receivers out jump the shorter USC corner especially that big old Anthony mix at 65 234 who happens to have a 42inch or three and a half foot vertical jump wolf second down and five run it Williams looking for daylight look at that two people missed the tackle ahead and right there's night but they don't get it now you get a penalty flag baby piece college football holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless welcome to my AT&amp;T Wireless and in part by Pacific Life I know it is insurance and investments rely on the strength of Pacific Life RadioShack you've got questions we've got answers and for November ease personal foul USB first down Auburn and the Tigers are knocking on the door with 50 seconds to go in the first half on a bad first half for Carnell Williams over a hundred yards or closer to a hundred yards rushing he's battling the cramps on the sidelines though he's out of there now and Brown is back Ralph SSB for the single back with three white up now I'm the sinner the gold 55 they pitch the ball back to brown got a whole right side it's not the five and hammered down to the two yard line Deshawn Hill and Melvin Simmons made the tackle but Brown made them pay for it the one advantage that Auburn has over NC is five that offensive line is fused in their mobile they get out in front they know they're going to get great effort from their tailback look at that shot that Brown puts on the secondary Betsy well they give you an idea of the size Crittenden the light tackle is 338 rockets 290 at Garden Island 294 Center 294 Lindsay at guard and Mark Parra the other tacklers 309 when you talk to Williams as to which side he likes to run into both his shackles are outstanding Tara and printed no mobility in their guards hawkish get out in front its first and goal Auburn first and goal for the Tigers at the frozen two yard line revolutionary new drama coming to ABC if you can solve this mystery you could put over a million dollars which Nevada spectral preview Tuesday September 17th at 9:00 8:00 central on ABC timeout called by Auburn the ball is right on the two Tigers have one timeout remaining and we have 23 seconds remaining to play in the first half Tigers trying to tie it up in a 147 ballgame with approaches bleeding Albarn I told you early on plays the five games of the month of September they go home to Western Carolina and bendy and then they go down to Starkville and decade barrels probably going to be grumpy after getting beat by inhouse alma mater on Saturday already gonna yeah that's four games in eighteen days for a lot the Auburn Tigers at sub schedule it couldn't resist though coming to LA and I can understand it the kids like it they're having fun first can go for the Tigers Brown boom wall nothing timeout Auburn's laps and that the clock 19 thick the thing about that type of play you if you don't make it you got to use your last timeout so now it almost limits you to throwin the ball in some type of fashion through your next couple of plays they have no ability to stop the clock remember they burned a timeout in the first quarter trying to draw out the SD offside Mike Pollard filled that hole boy there was nothing doing that big old 225 senior out of Long Beach just block the door well you got 19 seconds and you can get we need you know two plays out of it maybe even three you're really quick I like your idea throwing the ball up for Anthony mix the six foot five freshmen well you know let's let's play catch let's play jump ball you got a guy that size and they got to put them in the game first of all that's right he's not in there they got the big ugly's in there the tight end yep woloson Johnson of course they like Johnson they like Johnson very much as a receiver and these customs eyes to e6 yeah we've already seen this active athlete remember how he leaned over Kalevala on a fake play earlier any of 87 BIM of the backfield this time and cops heaped it and going for the goal line they're calling touchdown linesman is sending their Ronnie Brown the ball came flying out I think Brown might have been following the play and caught the ball on the ricochet it is touchdown you know you've been a lot of ball games but you haven't been a touchdown like that one I wasn't here I saw his hands go up but I was going to wait until the referee capitalized it and finally he did what that ball complying out now as the cop goes in there and here's brown right behind him and Ronnie grabbed it and muscles his way just far enough to get the touchdown 11 seconds to go in the first half this John Hill knocked it out but does he get in the official right on the line there's been the ball broke the Plainsman score here's the point and the point by blue ball is good and we're going to go to the clubhouse it looks like all even they go 91 yards on 15 plays using six minutes and 43 seconds but remember it was a 12 man on the field penalty that gave Alban the first down out of the 30 yard line that gave him life on that possession and then a couple of personal foul penalties against that's the eight into the drive let's check it out keep zeebee got in great shot there by Hill knocking the ball loose heads up by Ronnie Brown picking it up out of the air but all he asks to is gets the ball over and Robert Johnson may get a huge assist for pulling them over crawl to your life ball went over I'll give it I think it went over the ball did but it wouldn't have bobert son know how you wrap them and pull them in that's right told you be a factor netplay did she say that he was the primary receiver on that boat light looked like it so Brown owes Johnson supper no kidding so offered exercising opportunity the Trojans getting careless making mistakes the Tigers counted and it's 1414 computer Duvall will kick off as a little bit of help from the breeze going that direction Rajan's have two receivers back at the goal line waiting and it's very high and hanging short and going on about those no time elapses and the ball will come out with the 35 yard line where Southern California will possess it first down with 11 ticks remaining on the clock of the first half now that's a terrible kick by Duval because that gives SC a chance to throw the ball deep down the field to get a completion they've got a timeout they could perhaps get their fine plays dhikr David David in range that is not really a nail that you see Tommy chewing on it but he might be like I like him well if I see I'd give it one shot you got a timeout us you got to go you get it you've got a second shot they stick at me and I run out your clock so four turnovers in the game or convert it into touchdown then we are at a halftime in a 1414 five maker Walt wolf the umpire pulled a muscle and had to go out of the game don't know if you'll be able to come back or not and here's Todd now with Coach Tommy Tuberville all right coach I know it's early this season but those turnovers the gotta get off you're crazy well you know we just we can't get anything going we're throwing the ball so we've got it running but the Cornell's doing good job offensive line is doing a good job defensively we've just got to be able to adjust to their set we've turned some guys too loose they they've got a lot of different debt phones so we're going to do a good job coach that had some good like them sticking out so it's 1414 at halftime we'll be back in a moment with the bell believes halftime show welcome back to the Valvoline halftime show 1414 tie between the Auburn Tigers and Southern California Trojans here's nan bounce now for highlights of that first half if it was turnovers than touchdowns in the first quarter Daniel Cobb is going to run and then get hit by middle linebacker Mike Pollard who also recovered the fumble that led to this 14 yard touchdown reception by Kareem Kelly great interception here by Carlos sands be very next play Carnell Williams goes 23 yards for the score that made 77 now in the second quarter Bob is going to be picked off by a defensive end Omar days l and co pham akahl will pay it off of that 3 yard run 147 SC and then this inner chef tempted by junior Row 3 because it's wacky touchdown by Ronnie Brown with an assist to Robert Johnson take away the mistakes nobody scored I guess well you know if the both teams are playing fairly well for a first game of the year but if you look at the rushing yardage for Auburn that really tells the story the second half if Carnell Williams can get over his crab problems they could be tough ok 1414 tie at halftime now as we begin our telecast tonight you saw the flyover of the u.s. Navy warriors from the L'Amour Navy stationed here in California they are out of the via a BFA 94 fighter squadron commanded by commander Brian Reeves and we noted that two of the four pilots had direct ties in this game lieutenant Mark Preston we saw approaching cutter in the late 80s and Lieutenant Dan hight a 93 Auburn graduate you got to be lucky to get a ride in one of these perhaps a little foolish or a whole lot brave I think Todd Harris has some of both he's in the back seat here with Dan hight Lieutenant Dan hight who is the 1993 offering graduate and Todd came back I should tell you with his bag clean and now here's Todd with the pilots from L'Amour all right Thank You Keith the best pilot in the world bar none from the Navy mark stoner Preston here you led the pack over here I got to ask you what is more daunting kicking out of your own endzone here at the Coliseum or flying up formation well kicking and flying over the Coliseum are pretty similar in one sense everybody's looking you got one shot to do it right if you don't do it right you're the goat you do it right you're the hero so they're pretty pretty similar in that sense you look great and the man who gave me the greatest ride of my life who said Dan milehigh duck I tell you during enemy territory here with an Auburn Tiger even around the world what's more dying to call it the more Afghanistan that's pretty tough BSU fans are not time but we got a lot of fans with us well we're tied up the forget second half all right thank you can appreciate the right teeth backup you I look good I think my paws off an osprey I got the dress I will fly off a rally in wild in 14 time between offers at USC this has been the felling halftime show short enjoy traveling max life the first motor oil formulated for a higher mileage engine we'll be back with the second half after this message and a word from our ABC stations you're watching ABC college football holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless this may be bad news for the Auburn football team and their faithful Cardell Williams coming out of the locker room at halftime back to record the field walking with some pain obviously having trouble with crimps and if he can't go that's a huge loss for this football team because he picked up 97 yards on the ground in the first half of play so he's having probably friends and you saw most of those yards came after contact so to the style that Carnell williams employs but that is a huge loss if he can't go Ronnie Brown did have a good first half the Auburn Tigers kick it off and it's way back into the end zone by Damon Duval and it'll come out to the 20 yard line where it'll be a first down here's Todd Harris's report regarding Carney William okay they'll tell you what all the Auburn people are watching the sidelines right now because they're man number 24 is down on the ground what they're saying is he's having problems with cramp in his leg they're being specific but they are spending a lot of time on his hamstrings he's taking in fluid but all they can do right now is just stretch until the his turn comes and they say you can go back out on the field he all right thank you Southern California will come out here with Carson Palmer at quarterback they'll have a suit on McCullough in the backfield Whitman's buddy bird did he's in there as the fullback and Palmer gives to McCulloch and McCulloch pops it over the right side when the half a stride from making it big time but he's dragged down from behind Sonny bird in there is the blocking back and did a good job for that you heard Pete Carroll say a little while ago as they came out from the locker room that he wanted to run the ball more in the second half here the first half step there being embarrassed on the ground averages just two and a half yards per carry that's a perfect way for SD to start the second half they've also both teams have to eliminate these turnovers McCullough picked up eight yards on that first carry of the second half he's got it again cuts back inside Tigers jump in he's gonna lose the yard or so on that carry that Auburn had great penetration on defense and Spencer Johnson got there early with Dansby just starting the second half 1414 tie between Auburn and USC that's just one of five converting third downs in the first half it is third and three Palmer froze fast Court good for the first down to Kareem Kelly number two he's after the 35 yard line and move your team and he may want to establish the running game and make the offense work through the running attack but if they're going to beat Auburn today tonight rather it's going to be with this type of play short controlled passing game the cream Kelley headsup move there well designed play to get the first down with the catch and Palmer with the time to throw put it right on the money see they've only picked up 40 yards and 15 carries his van had noted not effective run it into the middle and there's nothing there he goes right down on the line of scrimmage DeMarco McNeal on Soltan McCullough lot of the attention goes to these great linebackers Brown Thomas and Dan's beef with DeMarco McNeil he allows them to run free that time he got a freebie of his own getting penetration and stopping McCullough second down and nine as they give McCulloch a yard that's Cole Burton motion Palmer still got it has some time to throw it ball ricochets off the intended receiver as Greg Gunther was defended tightly and it is an incomplete forward pass that ball green all the way back almost to the quarterback Palmer talked about hitting the receiver in the facemask I think this one hit him in the helmet piece fine throw by Palmer finds it tied in yep right to the hands right off the noggin yep günther is a sophomore out of Calabasas they're down and nine throws to the sideline they'll give him the 45 and that'll be enough for a first down even getting close to the line of scrimmage it was Mike Williams the big freshman receiver that was walking the chalk and made the catch he wears number one but he really should be wearing like 89 or something because he is picked five 210 pounds keeps his balance there and now knows where the marker is make the catch the sex addict beat picks up the first down hit play for a freshman so the Trojans keep the ball make it a burst down at the 45 McCullum's defended the backfield offered is offsides they've got a free play here McCulloch running to the right side picks up about 3 yards then to be got caught in the neutral zone or he's 65 224 pounds and anxious cool and 408 for 440 I can't believe these numbers that they get on some of these live bags look Elizabeth Knapp got chief Palmer pulled them up hard hard count yeah a little hip hop looking right at we didn't play by Carson Palmer got away with it sometimes you'll flag you for that first down and five now after the offside penalty all makethe drop those short just beyond the marker balls naughty bird to pull back that's another first down for the Trojans at the Auburn 44 if crowd favorite sunny bird gets involved he'll back by necessity last year when the injury bug hit the Trojan backfield the crowd gave a nice little applause there actually tonight you have what was when they started fall practice and starting backfield and civilian blows with Dustin Farkas the sail back and chat Pearson the Hoban they're not even dressed / Worf oh what a play that is by Denby and his come in quarterback Hutton there was nobody to keep him from his worry and he just upended person run admit people Norm Chow calling the next play but this one you got to give Eugene's hits at number 11 coming on to Bliss stream Kelly turns him loose on the route what an athletic tackle picking up Carson Palmer who's no little guy 230 pounds and down 11:07 ago in the third quarter the Trojans have the football at midfield it is second down and 17 armor gives us to my lipoma kinde McKinsey with a big run almost get the birth dad he gets about 16 yards on that carry McKenzie the big guys 225 pounds and healthy for really the first times it became the USD seems like SD is having more success when they go straight at Auburn it off the left side here of the screen right side of the offensive line at the cute hole and the quickness of Mackenzie to get through it you're not going to run sideways against already going worse this is McKenzie hanging over the left side and getting the first down as the Trojan offensive front has played pretty well tonight I think they've done all right at the conclusion of today's game we'll select the Chevrolet player of the game from each team Chevrolet making $1,000 contribution to each University general scholarship fund the ball rests at the 33 of over to 14 14 5 10 20 to go as a finisher order and the Sun is about gone into the Pacific Vollmer throwing as is complete thrown hard the curico burn Hobart will go down to the 20yard line for another USD first down and again at the short control path again they use that bunch formation that time and call the Palmer reading Goldberg getting open in the middle in these receivers are so both he and Kelly are so good at just sitting down and giving their quarterback a stationary target but you can put the ball right between the numbers darrel Poston is in there at the tailback got fresh legs but he can't get to the corner and they track him down a junior out of Huntington Beach and you didn't have the quickness and Auburn had figured that play pretty quickly they came right to it you know we've been talking about the cramp problems that kind of William is experienced well Rodrick hooded in the locker room we're told also having trouble with cramps I'm a little surprised you know because Auburn cotton Auburn it is assistant and humid Rashad Walker is in there at a corner spot replacing hood and there's Parnell Williams still walking around he's up and move it about now he's been try to play Carson Palmer penalty flag is down ball in court by Brandon Hancock to pull back and hand got down inside the 15 but let's see you about your penalty flag thrown by our substitute umpire and this is what it usually is holding against the offense so that will pack them up then yards The Drew Carey Show and whose line is it anyway we'll make it early premiere next Monday along with the regular season premiere of Monday Night Football that drew at boos line starting next Monday on ABC is won't back out there he's an old couple' warrior yeah you knew this he couldn't see out there and make sure everybody knows he's out there throwing to fly yeah a little hit soon as get along to make it second down and 22 now after the holding call against the projym and Palmer back throws this one to McCullough got a little bit of room first man missing and he's out of about the 22 short of his first down he's got to go way down there to the 10 yard line to get that really a good call by Norm Chow Auburn playing a zone defense watch the screen come out to this side as the bomber faced the passes draws the defense to him and now the convoy out in front McCulloch make Roger Smith and that's a good gain after that penalty though it is third down and 12 now pressure coming almond running sound of the pony that's the original line of scrimmage going to be fourth down and ten here comes the kicking team and now is a great call by team Civic a zone blitz that time he talked about the pressure but the man who was flying on the quarterback was defensive tackle Wayne Dickens number 96 he just dropped back there look for Palmer to run and stop them told this chess match between these coordinators tonight David Davis 160 pounds senior out of Hawthorne California he's 15 of 18 in field goals in his career as long as 47 this is 37 he banged it and he got it and the Trojans go back to the leave by score of 17 to 14 at 7:05 to plan a third quarter you're watching ABC Sports championship television Trojan man who put it up there teamleading 17 to 14 and here is Ryan Killeen kicking off the USC Trey Smith he is a single man beep in the end zone he'd come in first time we've had his hand on the football tonight Ajira holding after the 20yard line ABC Sports presentation of college football brought to you by Chevy trucks the most dependable longest lasting trucks on the road just from in jail specially formulated for mustache beards and sideburns rejuvenator Verizon Wireless we never stopped working for you and Olive Garden where a great Italian food tells you when you're here you're family what was that thing for beards and mustaches could use some of that extension Darnell Williams is back in the backfield but Daniel Cobb puts it down throws it up field of the sidelines in the pass is incomplete that was a great incomplete bath to staring down the rush of SD just flipping his sidearm and avoiding a loss that would have pinned the Tigers back inside there's 10 yardline obimomm who was the intended receiver got to know when to throw the ball away and he does such a good job he almost gets a completion out of it in fact Jobe Amano came real close to pick that one up yes second down ten this is William slide down behind the line of scrimmage at the second time now he slipped here's our Pacific Life game summary mail of turnovers in that first half linebacker Mike Pollard forcing the fumble from Daniel table and then getting the recovery and an outstanding interception by Carlos Dan being linebacker for Auburn Omar nasal drops off from his defensive end spot picked off top there and then junior Rose B will pick off Palmer for the second attempted and then a turnover that wasn't a turnover but was it touchdown Ronnie Brown out of his gut gun for over on third down and long trouble for COD he takes away from one throws up the middle and the boar that was almost picked off that one was almost stolen by the John Hill but it didn't complete it brings up fourth down of the bag of wool fun a lot better to piston theories for the Trojan pressure on the quarterback two plays in a row fine job of pressuring by Kenichi Oh desi and then almost intercepted by Sean Hill as he dives forward but can't take it off now here's Damon Duval he had a 69 yarder and a 39 yard when he gets all of it it's something to watch and he got most of this one it's fielded and Corrine Kelly masters off the tackler he's looking for help there's a block in the back they get away with it not at all either there's a penalty flag very clearly a block in the back by the short hill and that on this side so I can through the flag vigil on the other side was backpedaling trying to get out of harm's way good teamwork by our crew of officials from the pac10 though another mistake I'm going to give up some precious real estate to that he's saying why does the official on this side of the field call it that's because he was running for his life it was a difficult don't worry about it it was a good call if you see it would you look here's the John Hill number five right here to call that clipping it was 15 yards then and illegal block in the back of still 15 Jarvis I I think Pete wanted a on the auburn side because he felt they tackled his man on a bow but they didn't do it this is ABC's college football holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless Carson Palmer could know some good numbers tonight completing 68% of his passes but the disturbing numbers that number two they're because of the pressure from Auburn they starts this possession 16 yard line run it up inside and we'll guess some of the yards on it with Brendan Hancock that's freshman he's a pretty goodsized fella 235 pounds but he when you're when you're young it's hard when you're trying to make the transition into a Division one college football because the the jump is so big the game is so bad compared to what you've been used to if no question or out of that yep just like going from college to the pros there's some hole on the left side for my lipo McKinsey pretty good blocking on the left side gave him a good 2 yard hole as you punch through there and picked up puts the ball out at the 22 yard line but they're going to be looking at third down at about 4 in a number of substitutes has done that Auburn defense and Darius Williams 31 had been there male foul another linebacker in there not replacing Roderick hood is Rashad Walker at corner they brought 75 players when Tommy thought a lot of them would play that goes Palmer they've been successful over the short passing game he throws that one beyond the reason however alec poems that I didn't Holmes was available he just didn't hit it looked like he had a case of happy feet there because he had time to throw and again in one of those bus routes that we've been talking about here's the thing i right in the middle gonna come right down over the middle but watch Palmer has he dropped back misses a wideopen receiver here's the punt by Tom Malone Goodman filled it by Marcel Villa and an woola's good return comes out around the 47 yard line when 420 to go in the third quarter put it on your spot 18 yards if Aaron Rodgers leading by three 1714 injury report Todd Harris well Keith Auburn is the only team is suffering for injuries right now they're saying that Ronald not he went into the locker room and I asked for the situation is nothing serious he'll be back but he hasn't come back and last two series and Melvin Simmons 51 the linebacker they're saying he's suffering from us face of bell ringing Ida he should be back maybe to steer eager to see Justin Wyatt and the freshman has to go in and play and Bobby Otani another freshman is in there throw them the young uns are get to the place on the night and here's a rare very good defensive surge by Southern California to bury the Auburn runner well short of the line of scrimmage g'day Gaz led the attacked in Carnell William distantly had no place to go he is carried the ball twice here in the second half and he's lost six yards because of the penetration Oh deadly 94 fights off the blocks on Crittenden quickness that time beat power and Hef so velocity is four yards would be second down in 14 Daniel Tosh back and penalty flag facemask nasal leaked over a blocker and in the process of reaching for the quarterback talk to facemask on the way down and will pay for it he might caught a little kid too I don't imagine that will be a big good morning yeah I think so on it's almost an init person one though you know it is something over grabbing a face mask on a defense 15 yards for the previous thought automatic foot sound normally when you take that head off like that and you can see the he's bleeding a little bit he got scratched Carnell Williams with the block that's better be 15 yeah if he did take this hand off the facemask right away doesn't get the flight perhaps or perhaps only a five yarder but he ensured the tackle he took Cobb all the way to the ground so the ball will come all the way down to the Southern California 42 yard line after that 15yard penalty via the second fewest penalties in the pac10 last year not going to make Pete Carroll happy they're going to take time here for Daniel Cobb to come to the sidelines and get a bandaid but see there's the scratch right under the eye as baby reached inside the facemask it's real close to poke in his eye oh yeah Jason Campbell then will be sitting in to quarterback now they use the timeout though Keith I think the Cobb will be able to go back in if they can get the bleeding stopped they're trying to Campbell is number 17 he was a starting quarterback through the last half the season last year six for two hundred pound sophomore out of Taylorsville Mississippi and he will have to go in as soon as this timeout expires and looks like he's going to unless they can repair stand you'll come it's not a big deal it's just a finger scratch on the face of the orbital quarterbacks next entity it'll be Alabama Oklahoma at 3:30 Eastern 12:30 Pacific here on ABC Sports a class of college football Oklahoma alum Devon from years you know when you to walk 40 miles to see Alabama we'll have a play and just the mere fact that they're going to get their next enemy is fun with those having been around those two programs for so many years and so many memories boy oh boy and you know Alabama's going to be fired up the eighth time they play a team that's highly ranked they consider it a bowl game where they will not be going any bowl game for a while no more Jason Campbell is in the game replacing Daniel Cobb I finally got a bandaid on him and I think they just the problem solved but here's Jason Jason hands the ball away to Cornell Williams and here's the third up the middle behind the orbit offensive front and they get something out of that moving from the according to down to about the 38 great power on that run by Carnell Williams what he did in the first half when he ripped off 97 yards this 23 yard beauty came after the Dansby interceptions but you can see how he's always thinking downs field never to the sidelines once he gets there he's going to take Gonzaga second down and six I formation a lot of formations tonight go back to final Williamson he's greeted by number 99 Mike Patterson and Lou Daisy numbers there's been a little bit different here in the second half for Cadillac this is why the penetration NT is planning and creating opportunities in the opponent's backfield with the quickness of Patterson than those Izzy Daniel carving back at quarterback now having been repaired and pressure coming passes away drills it in they're complete good pass thrown with authority and right in between eight and nine on big Anthony makes it let me get the ball of that big guy that's why you go back to your starting quarterback he's a little bit fired up because you've got a bandaid on his eye but he's also been in the flow of the game mixed number 89 on the inside the plant that's a bright a nice hard low path by Cobb it's an easy catch for the freshman Anthony mix he puts his body on you I mean he's a field and hard to get to it I'll follow him on the 49yard line Tom rolls off but it keeps it going to take a liquor as he gets down to about the 22 yard 23 yard line Omar nasal again getting the piece of the action Daniel Cobb may kick himself when he sees this one in the tapes tomorrow because he had Anthony mix on a deep post route against Darrell Rideau Rideau is 5 8 Anthony makes 55 just put it up there's nobody else factor but those two has got to be six points you throw it at him aroma show drew he's the white man great speed run the ball with Williams and Williams trying for the first down is going to have it he got just inside the 19 yard line and that will be just enough it appears he can see where they put it you got an Auburn man down on the field that'll be Ben now on the center number 55 and a good would miss him is the Remington watch candidate and whenever you lose your center you talk about a scary time because now you've got to think about the center exchange through the quarterback Jeremy Engle is listed as the backup center but oftentimes some of those guards and tackles have played in particularly guards who played the center position before so you never know it is going to be a first down for Auburn when play resumes as they attend to in Nollan big senior out of Ponte Vedra Florida and it's Danny Lindsay the left guard is going to move over to the center position and that'll put troy Redick into the game at left guard and Troy Redick a true freshman you got a sophomore moving in for his enter when Lindsey moves over to Nolan's spot and now Redick moves up the true freshman under the bright lights of LA the sun's going away now it's been a very hot day two days here it's both start cooling off tomorrow but the Auburn Tigers are going to read our home they'll go and right from here to the airport into the plane lock the doors and see you and they may get out of that plane on the other end and go out to the practice field they don't have a whole lot of time before their next ball game they let get home at a reasonable hour won't they like what 2:30 3 o'clock oh my lord let's see what Todd can tell us about the Auburn Center well Keith near the kid who is helping cancer patients believe it not with his hair he grew in pairs 10 inches over the course of a year and a half so he can cut it off and donate it to charity the charity told lots of love the charity for cancer patients who have lost their hair feels emo and they use it to make wigs so here's a guy really you'd expect more from his size and probably even his hair to help out some good people I think he looks better I knew you would but then I would wouldn't he had a couple different colors the hair there dude it can help out a whole bunch of folks and he's humbling a bit so he's done some damage to one of his extremities he's gonna have to sit down for a time and here we go first down at the 19yard line or I'll burn the USD 19 1714 cogent path the lead Tigers are threatening and Daniel Cobb rolls out drop he throws the ball back the other way has a man oh my word Robert Johnson was all alone look away to see where everybody was that lost the football yeah netball and then run he knew he was wide open he knew he was close to the end zone here is right here watch the action goes this way and then it's the throwback great job at selling the block there watch him get up and now he knows to be catching his ball he may score if he catches the ball subir second down and ten nothing doing frozen meet up the tailback Carnell Williams never had a chance they've controlled him in the second half now they're doing a good job of getting wind it slants that time they plant it to the field and that's exactly where to Auburn want to run the ball both these coaches have a defensive history in their coaching career then we have come to the end of three Auburn continues to threaten but USC continues to lead 1714 back after this message and the word from our ABC station as we come back to the final quarter here at the Coliseum on third down and 13 Auburn pass is incomplete Anthony mix didn't hold it the pass at him right on the numbers he was falling down the ball was catchable and he did not do it at the only place the Daniel cop could have thrown this ball because the safety was coming over and the freshman had his B flip out from underneath them and can't come up with a cat this is a great throw by God he has to throw it hard and low as the slant route there go the feet there goes the ball his breath I was Damon Duval a 39 yard field goal try starting the fourth quarter is 20 leg and it could and so we're all even we've got 14 minutes and 51 seconds to resolve this issue cup high football game 17 tie in the fourth quarter Damon Duval will kick off our plant this seed David Duval had three game winning field goals last year he hammers it into the endzone is six yards deep and Jason Mitchell it's old to push the knee down son you're not going to run it out ABC's college football holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless apt welcome to in life AT&amp;T Wireless and in part by Suzuki maker of innovative motorcycles and allterrain vehicles and proud sponsor of Theismann Trophy Award now believes max wife the first motor oil formulated for higher mileage engines and not you can take life as it comes oh you can grab life on the horn dot the flame is lit that's the Los Angeles Coliseum as darkness settles in and here the Trojans first down from their own 20yard line and Carson Palmer's gone all the way at quarterback on a roll out penalty flag is floating in the air behind him thrown to the referee it is probably is holding the pass was completed to careen killer holding against the Trojan just another mistake as we take a look at our Pacific Life game summary about drop passes this Greg Gunther wide open over the middle I was flying off at faith and the Auburn side end Robert Johnson drops the potential beam breaker there as is Anthony mixed the couplet almost touchdown for Auburn in that last drive but they did come away with the pill goal to tie it up holding call against the Trojans move the football back to the 10yard line and that's where those 37 penalties now for SD 487 yard it's tough to overcome and got enough feast for that to continue our hands it off inside traffic busan masala finding daylight good run by the fella gets it out to the 24 yard line in the first down Rashad Walker took his feet away yeah Walker make the tackle that perhaps saves the touchdown because nobody's going to catch those down McCulloch be get down into the clear a drop plays a perfect call good vision power to break that tackle now just watch good tackle by Walker's he barely brings down McCulloch McCullough has got to step through this tackle though this what it would not have brought down Carnell William ball is just short of the 25 yard line as they market Auburn blitzing they pick it up passes thrown pass is caught by Furyk overt and covert after about the 35 and that's one of the first down so Southern California now puts the real estate at their back and they had room to move and they overcame that holding penalty brought themselves from inside their own 10yard line now out to the 35 in just two plays McKenzie is the DFAC for the Trojan he gets the ball he runs into a pile of humanity and picked up a couple of yards even with that vine run by zoltán McGowan SD 6.9 that's not going to get it done but this number here has been a big improvement Brett deep deep end as they have bugs kept Carnell William conject in fact Williams in the second half 1 yard those he is hurt double to his prints yep second down and eight Palmer's wasn't under these four Kinsey coming out of the backfield now I proba Kinsey down to the 33 yard line off over done various promise linebacker ran him down yeah John period comet past Mackenzie Amanda man covers and Mackenzie on an OP stand out with a great move here he comes out of the backfield here is Thomas is going to go out and in and Thomas is going to flip and fall down watch the head fake great sharp route and then down the field formal eyeful Mackenzie that's why he's been guarding tailback every down player can do it all 32 yards on that play he's in motion now as McCulloch comes in as the step back McCulloch gets the ball and nothing to do in that traffic and J reckless and here's a penalty flag two of them as a matter event I'd have a little personal foul coming up here that's all push the file on coming up it should be that the crucial penalty gets offered Marc Brown the recipient of the tonguelashing puts the football inside the Auburn 19 yard line for a first down McCullough Z's McKinsey layup back the eights back if you want to call it that all is thrown underneath down the middle ball goes to Kareem Kilic Ali from Oh Auburn looks like they may have a white shirt went for it the fight is on underneath will sue who gets to Cole I think Oberyn might have that ball since to the heart done digging it out I'll tell you this it in Auburn ball Junior Road screen with the big hit on Corrine's Kelly pop that ball loose and attending plays guest at the bottom of that pile but it is a tiger with it here he comes number 11 it's Carlos Dems be who comes out of there with the ball Kelly on the crossing route trying to make a big play here as he cuts up the field watch number 4 from the right side here again he puts his shoulder and elbow right on the ball and Dan feeds at the bottom of the pine for the recovery big play second big playing tonight for junior Rose green and the pro teams the golden opportunity of frittered away as Auburn takes over first down at their own 12 yard line top turns and gives it to Brendan Johnson the fullback Brown jumps when he carried the ball tonight he spins for a couple won't give it to will give you one the Rose green gets an interception in the first half horses the fumble here Dansby it's an interception in the first half and recovers the fumble here you know who field was a whole lot better right now is Martin brass son you bet he does top checking off is the quotas listen a koala Malo at the line of scrimmage it leads it back Williams behind the line of scrimmage John Cody made that circle take a look at our dodge defensive playbook and what SD is trying to do is pull a motto is move them around in different positions it's going to be used as a pass rusher throughout the season and trying to create confusion in the pass blocking assignments of the offense with its speed and determination one false step by a pass blocker and a quarterback to big trouble but Auburn's done a good job tonight of not finding Where's Waldo but where's Polamalu Matt Goethe Gord is coming out the ball game were to go to sophomore out of Huntington Beach and it looks like Matt had his bell rung a little bit because the teammates were talking to him and the furnace came in a hurry he never did step down or anything he just got to come out rest a little bit Dallas arch will come in and replace him he is a freshman on a credit Bay California it is third down and ten for Auburn was in the defense trying to hold them and Daniel Compaq get feet tips away gets them daylight and throws incomplete and so the thief in did its job the defense actually has been doing this job the whole second hand there's no question about it we talked about it the troubles were that Carnell Williams has had but the family game had faced a lot of pressure surprising mobility by Daniel copiers he breaks away from John Cody and just can't get a good grip on that ball but if he had thrown and could pass it might have been picked off though Duvall out of the end zone history at the school yard line pretty good kick Kelly yes that almost got around the corner it was almost the block in the back but not quite on either case but Southern California has very good field position after a 49yard punt and a 10yard return 17 tie with ten minutes and five seconds to play in the ballgame the Southern California Trojans will own the football at midfield for this possession time permitting stay tuned for the 50 car rental postgame report and here the trojan the Trojan defense did a heck of a job there and keeping Auburn him back after having fumbled it away and they give it back to the office great field position remember David Davis is an outstanding place kicker for SD he is take long to get him and rein McCullough is the beat back he's got the ball going to the left side and Auburn fetch him down in a hurry and no game attendance tonight 60 3269 the crowd crowd a lot of Auburn Tiger fans beer filling up the west end zone 10,000 is it and they're loud dictates the price some of these laidback Southern California pants earlier in the game all they've got berber you go down to Auburn and watch a ballgame in that big ol eightysix thousand feet Stadium I say here's a ring for a week second down and ten pressure was on ball was away completed to McKenzie penalty flag came right in front of McKenzie as Palmer delivered it quickly because there was an Auburn men right nice pace Carlos Dan field right in his face that was Dan be offsides so they'll pick up five yards on that make it the first down and five you know actually then I never did a ballgame in the news new over to do when they got all fancy in 86 down and see those gone oh it's not too late for you to go back I'm not allowed anymore that's we don't own that territory well Carlos Danvers had a great night this is a mistake though watch him try to beat the snap count but the lined up because he was safe there when the ball was snapped got four tackles on the night a sack interception bumble recoveries been all over the place second down and five that's McCulloch doesn't do it now he's just not going to get it why no he cannot run wide on this defense you know who the very motivated player we talked about Mark Brown he that of the linebacker don''t arias Thomas right there make sure the McCullough head go out of bounds what's the speed of the linebackers they just take off and fly Carlos Rogers fighting off the chicken flock Marine Kelly there third and six now for this play penalty flag half foot as is completed to cure a covert all the way down the 25yard line but look on for the flag that's done holding all over or illegal motion or motion yeah great pass and great catch too bad coming back are cameto legal i boy he just on that did me and I did do perfected after I saw March special people think I'll wipe my glasses Kelly Hayes is back with us again this year most of our crew back and it's a good bunch and it's good for me to be back with this fifth bunch oh yeah we're happy to have Tim brand who spent two years here while you were gone engulfed naked his fortune in the ACC in the biggie I heard he's making a fortune it's third down he loved being third 9/11 Palmer throws bollard caught underneath by Kelly Kelly need some help you got it and he's got the first down helmets lying around but he holds over the football as he gets inside the 35 yard line ream Kelly is making a statement tonight himself you know that I didn't have a very big year last year himself well remember he had that tumble last time is he had the ball deep in the red zone it was a great effort because he's got a long way to go after he makes the catch to pick up the first down and there's some head knock and going on okay it's a huge play by Kelly well clearly both teams want this game there is no question about it it means a lot to them but does it it'll extra probably move SB up a little bit in the minds of some if they think handle Auburn certainly a reverse might be for the Tigers Gary is down to the 30yard line or futon McCullough because 190 pounds but Kent is 225 so they're pretty goodsized and the other number four in today's game junior Rose Green is the guy that popped the helmet off of green jelly he's only a sophomore this is a young Auburn team and they're going to cause some trouble in the SEC both um last year beat Florida second down call it seven Palmer back gets rid of it throws at the sunny bird and sunny bird turns around and bang there's Rashad Walker and they butted heads and Downey went but he secured the catch he lowered his head fell for 6m finesse D first down so they moved the change to the 22 yard line of Auburn at six minutes and 41 seconds to play in the ball game a 1717 so seems to come out of here win or lose feeling they have been tested Palmer handed off to McCullough well assist in tries to come back out get to it as the Thomas makes another tackle Don Terry is Thomas who is on the watch list for both the Lombardi Award and the Butkus Award showing us why was fun to see David household Susan come by tonight for a little bit hadn't seen him in a while he's the athletic director now having come up through the ranks has always been an Auburn man I used to enjoy watching all David sit down that old typewriter and great things came out of that old typewriter he's really good now the ad second down and 11 and Palmer throws underneath it goes to Mackenzie Mackenzie diving for the first down gonna come up just a little bit short about a yard short Mark Brown reaching and getting just enough this is going to bring up a real interesting third down and short for SD haven't had a whole lot of success on the ground palmer has settled in in the second half numbers are very solid not going interception they've had success with the intermediate router specially the punch route well you get the feeling they're going to run it don't you dare them to explore mayshen gives you that feeling they are and Susana McCullough dive twists now is open close enough for the chains so they'll bring them off Pete Carroll's got to get out those old clips of Zam the BAM Cunningham going up over the top on third and short oh he's short first down oh my goodness that was close now has need to work on the clock 4:42 to play in the game or that could have been more than an evidence it would read close of colors in the back view with study bird Kolbert King hosted McCullough step to ball and finds a little daylight on the left side running right in behind sunny bird and he's going to have a pretty good pickup out of that looking very little variety in the SD running attack but that's by design they want to run a few plays well instead of running a bunch of different thing be quick norms that strength of this team is in at tailback right now and they are performing five yards on that play moves the ball down to the 8 yard line of Auburn second down and five o'clock again inside the five folks to the three this becomes a matter of will you hear about who wants it more right now that if the offensive line is controlling Auburn up front that offensive line in the tourism ball game off and on all night even hurt their victim down down coming hands who integrated football of the state of Alabama as much as anybody and after John McKay took the frozen's down there in beat Alabama like 42 to 28 bear took him into the locker room and said bors I just wanted you to meet a football player damn cunningham delightful man all this just short of the three yard line and there's timeout now called by southern california two minutes in 53 seconds to play in the ball game the trojans have their faith right in front of it third down and a long yard for the Southern California Trojans just short of the three yard line Auburn 3 they've been down here before and they haven't done anything with it this is a chance to win the ballgame perhaps right here give it some McCulloch he'll have the first down they will have a first and goal about the few yard line maybe inside of it take a look a couple of key played for senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly a critical mistake here is he forced to follow five junior Rose green and then on third and 11 what Kelly can first which is 18 yard resistance and takes the big hit from Rhodes green once again everybody on both sides of this big old stadium kind of holding their breath first and goal and the ball comes out penalty flag down fight going on for the football Rodin's day they have it a golfer might have been off died Palmer gets up with it here's the call Auburn's offside well they're anxious able to get there that might have been what caused the fumble in the first place could have been he fááááá after this is the goal from previous pot still first down Auburn has two timeouts remaining taken out of four limits for time roll off this plot but there was 223 McCullough disease fan Palmer gives it to him bright side tops at the goal line solid solid hit by Marc Brown little linebacker I got a user time out slow clock shows two minutes we go inside two minutes to play in the ball game now eventually Etsy is going to explore whether it sets down or a field goal you would think what a great tackle by Brown and jr. Rhodes green once again playing his first game as safety the converted corner ball is on the oneyard line McCullough single back now here comes bird across the block boring and Palmer Kingdom and I'm waiting for a man in the striped shirt to put up his hand there it is touchdown Trojans wasn't easy but they got it in and helps me pick dick for 230 pounds and to think it from the goal line 13 plays to go 50 yards and lift a bit they use 8 minutes and 39 cents that's awesome Davis for the point it's good still went 120 thick to play of the ballgame Southern California goes to the lead by 24 to 70 Carson Palmer walking around he looks lucky he's been dwarfed he's been used tonight but he sticks it in the end zone to take the lead Carnell williams now is back on the field clamps and all he's minus three in the second half the cramps indecision thinkin part the horse power away from the Auburn offensive the second half but he's back there at the goal line waiting for the kickoff yeah will they kick it to him I wouldn't his young man's had a good night kicking off he's put a few deep in the end zone evidence Williams is back there now you lean hip it knocks it big and deep and he kicked it away from him he did not kick it and he kicked it into the far corner and gave him no chance to get his hands on the ball that means government has to start at the 20yard line with a minute and 26 seconds playing the game and you look at the total offense in the fourth quarter here in that long drive all those plays by SD you got to give a lot of credit these defense shutting down this Auburn office they're going to be tested now though these are compounded fast receivers for top often has two times up remaining as copies back to throw can't get it off and nobody to throw it to but you got to throw it somewhere thought he throw it out of bounds throw it somewhere if no get back but he didn't lose more than a half a yard on the tackle yeah that tackle forth them use their time a second time out here in the second half is not the strength of this offense in now and incidentally the Orban Center who had to leave the game earlier is back at center stop wearing the band they that's the finger scratch from facemask foul a minute and 15 seconds to play in the game as Auburn has the time out to talk about it working to make us all winners on the road minute 15 second down a little more than 10 for the Tigers they've only gained 13 yards of the second half Daniel Cobb lets it go to the sideline ball is caught by Marcell Willis and the bullets will have a first down as he gets it up near the 40 that's perhaps the biggest play they've had for the whole second half has to be and Willis showing good strength to pull away from the tackler Justin Wyatt this freshman all is on the 38 yard line first down for the Tigers you got a minute hate that play required seven seconds staying in the shotgun was three white up real quick pass to the sidelines Willis grabbed right about the 40yard line that's the first time that's Jason leashed making the tackle for Southern California on the first down pass a pickup of two yards at hi Pat had really hurt Marcell Willis speed and they may go ten yeah he made a tough catch and then it comes down and leads with real good reaction now you've got 57 seconds to play at the ballgame and remember next Monday night Al Michaels John Madden Super Bowl champs the New England Patriots against the Pittsburgh Steelers that will be at mine Eastern 6:00 Pacific on ABC's Monday Night Football and except for the Denver Broncos who repeated at Super Bowl champs and haven't gone all that well for our Super Bowl camp lately a lot of shuffling around a lot of veterans will let go worth it yeah that's free agency that salary cap comes that's the NFL it's second down and eight to factors in this second half for Southern California defense create again up and Cornell Williams losing his ability to do much because of leg cramps really hurt and Southern California finally managed to punch it in detective 2417 lead 57 seconds as we get ready to pack now second down and eight from the 40 yard line all rows back to Cobb he parked behind the line of scrimmage snapper over on the ground back to him but that's picked it up and from the big old Mike Patterson had a hold of him and down he went and the clock will control all burned down a timeout now is a risky call by SD coming with the Blitz but it paid off inside 40 go down to 35 second Bob looking deep throws down the middle with it all is incomplete Locke tops with 28 seconds intended for Anthony mix Anthony mixes got to get a new pair of Jews that's twice now he should have made a catch earlier in the quarter he had a chance to make a catch at about the 2 yard line similar type around similar type of result beat flip out from under but he can't make the catch beau up down with 28 seconds to play it is fourth down and 14 this could be the ballgame right here koujun all back in cover Bob let's go to the sideline ball is caught but the Trojans having dropped their defense back converged on the receiver take him down and take over the football with 17 seconds to play in the ball game real smart defensive football for Pete Carroll's empty Trojan here in the second half knowing when to bring the pressure and when to drop back into coverage they roll the dice each time and they came up winner Southern California has a week off and then they go to Boulder to play the Colorado Buffalo right now they all drop back into their zone the only man open is Carnell William and when he catches the ball Trojans are closed now all we have to do is start the clock in the game is over today's Chevrolet players of the game are Carlos Denby of Auburn five tackles a stack interception and fumble recovery and all a night of form it Carson Palmer at quarterback for Southern California three hundred and two yards on 23 out of 32 and the gamewinning
