============================================================

barbarians opponents because of that man Bo Jackson number 34 who is left for 1523 yards and nine games this season but he's been bothered by a deep thigh bruise still a very important game for Jackson individually today it may determine whether or not he wins the Heisman Trophy great rivalry out of the south coming your way today and with a temperature near 80 degrees 82,000 looking on soldout Sanford Stadium in Athens Georgia Auburn taking on the Georgia Bulldogs and we can first update you a big game in the SEC Tennessee has defeated Mississippi thus the volunteers still control their own destiny for them to go to the Sugar Bowl they'd have to win their next two games as you see the Conference standings Florida was a winner over Kentucky today but they are ineligible for the conference championship Tennessee is 3 &amp; 1 there is Georgia still an outside and here's the mark of 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 &amp; 2 overall i'm al michaels welcome to athens this should be quite a ball game as far as the two teams are concerned and stulen knew he had a good team at the beginning of the season then recall on opening night it looked as if they had pulled out a miracle victory on the Block cut then Mike Sheila led Alabama down the field that's the only game Georgia's launched this season and that lost might very well keep them out of the Sugar Bowl as far as Robert is concerned a lot of people thought they'd be number one they were going for a national championship so if you think 7 &amp; 2 is disappointing well in a way it is when you're seeking a national championship but a lot of coaches would like to live with a mark of 7 &amp; 2 and that is pack ties record as he brings his Tigers in the Appleton now last week Georgia with a big win over then number one ranked guar that won it by a score of 24 3 here's Vince Dooley talking about the residual effect today well there's no doubt that has put added life to a football team but we do have a very difficult assignment and traditionally we have this assignment and that is to play two great teams and great programs and great rivals backtoback that is to come off of the Florida win which is a big win and then have to play a team like all been a great rival like Auburn we're sort of the Florida this week Florida had the same problem last week after their great win over Auburn having to play us so it is very difficult but there's no question that it's given us new life new hope for the possibilities of a championship new into Moines with conference losses to Tennessee and in Florida in seven and two overall they are seeking a spot in the top ten they still haven't changed in that and also they do figure to be going to a bowl looked like it will be the Super Bowl by any stretch of the imagination and the Georgia Bulldogs are ready to make their entrance 31 and won the conference mark the loss as we mentioned the tie surprisingly with Vanderbilt as the Bulldogs get ready to make their entrance before this ruck is proud of 82 the Bulldogs against the Tigers I'm joined now by League rosca everybody knows bull Jackson to zoo ballgames late for Auburn everybody knows Bo Jackson is still in quest of the Heisman Trophy but what about his condition Bo Jackson spent most of this week in the training room rehabilitating a deep thigh bruise he practiced finally for about 15 minutes yesterday and apparently he feels pretty good historically we have seen him play with pain and he has had some of his best games in big games like this even with a healthy bo Jackson and with good ground attacks on both sides do you sort of get some little suspicion that the quarterbacks may make the difference today I had that feeling early in the week and it was confirmed by both coaches Pat dye feels that Pat Washington right now is throwing the ball about as well as he has ever seen him throw the football and he wants him to put it up more than usual to test a problem secondary for Georgia so look for him to throw maybe 20 to 30 times James Jackson the same for Georgia he's more of a scrambler but he has a very strong arm now Georgia is a slight favorite two or three points depending on the line and most of that due to the fact they are playing between the hedges here at Sanford Stadium so what does Auburn have to do to win the game well for right now I'm going to revert to some coach's buzzwords it's going to be balance and consistency on offense pressure and containment on defense simple but not easy and fewer turnovers might help as well Georgia Auburn coming up from Athens when we come back series record georgia 41 victories over in 47 games that wound up as ties it's been a terrific rivalry through the years it began back in 1892 Pat guy is a graduate of Georgia and as most of me who followed this court know Vince Dooley is a graduate of Auburn and here we go with Auburn set to receive the kickoff it is a short tick and his angle toward the near side and he's taken at the 20 yard line by Kyle Collins and he is out of bounds right there so Collins makes the catch as you look at Pat Washington Bo Jackson's starting a tailback then Tommie Agee is the fullback in front of Bo out of the I formation the H back is Ron Middleton and Freddie wag and the wide receiver Collins I think doing Georgia a bit of a favor by making the catch on the ball it was going to and Georgia would have had to read kick at the chrony guideline on first down who picks up two second down and eight let's look at the line now Jeff sparks 233 pounded the tight end Steve Wallace is outstanding 6x 265 nice from Atlanta Jeff watt is another good one out of Gainesville Georgia Ben Tamburello from Birmingham the center Dan coward at the other guard spot and Stacy Searles into the final is a very good offensive front second down and seven with the ball of a 23 yard line and Washington to put it up for the first time he throws was bought by a GF in the deflection and age Calvin ruff put the pressure on Washington was hit as he threw the ball it came loose was deflected into the hands of easy number 30 now how's this for turning adversity to advantage you can see Pat Washington sitting up here the ball bounces off number 66 his offensive lineman into the hands of Tommy Agee his fullback number 30 no that was not a gadget play that has a little bit of luck the same thing bo Jackson his first carry and we'll watch him very carefully and see if we can detect any slight limp any sort of minor problem that still exists we talked about the bruised eye he's been banged up this year and that's part of the reason he has been relatively inconsistent of late but today is a very key game for him obviously and his race for the Heisman as you look at Georgia's defensive unit and that secondary is banged up and could be vulnerable we'll find out second down and five Jackson third down five at the 42yard line brings up the first passing situation let's see if Pat Washington goes to the air as Pat dye mentioned during the week is lying to a left Washington look that way then back over the middle and throws into traffic at the 47 box was there Mitch a couple of Bulldogs he says no cash gift parks number 82 is the tight end on the right as Washington looks left comes back to parts apparently it looks apparently to be a catch but John Brantley who plays walltowall linebacker number 42 really got a shot on him dislodged the football and it's ruled incomplete Lewis Kolbert one of the best in the country averaging 45 point one to put it in the air good high kick and a fair characters grow four at thee we'll take working at the 90 on its first series 44yard punt fish shy of his average and the Bulldogs take over at the 19 yard line it's been a very warm and the two freshmen Worli along with him as the running backs as you look at the offensive unit Jackson Worley and his running mate Henderson both having big games last week in the Gator Bowl Jimmy Hockaday the wide receiver on one side and Freddy Lane the other loss of one second down and 11 and it's Herman Archie in the game number 81 he goes in motion Jackson rolling to his left throwing against the grain and nobody is there the intended receiver was Archie but the pants was well overthrown take a look now at the offensive line with Troy's Sadowski freshman starting at tight end Wilber Strozier to 51 Stevens weighs 245 Anderson is their main man they call him the bell cow the center Matt burrows the other guard and the other tackle is Victor Perry at 272 pounds third down and 11 with Jackson from the 18 yard line and it's clouding up on a warm day in Athens boilie wrapped up back in the 14 by Gerald Williams the 63 270 pound senior stopping him behind the line of scrimmage and so the Bulldogs not only don't pick up a first down they don't gain anything they go backwards on every play and are forced to punt from deep in their own territory back to kick is Chris Carpenter averaging 42 yards a kick last week he had a 64 yard nura gainst the Gators and Tre game is number 19 the offer and wide receiver is back to receive detect standing at his own 40yard line fair catch is called for by ganas who backs up all the way to the 29 yard line so carpenter gets them out of a hole with a 57yard kick and the Tigers have the ball back with 1101 to go in the quarter each team has had the ball once neither able to move we played four minutes and Auburn imagined to start a second series at the 20 Washington hardly matter Daisy wasn't going anywhere anyway second intent as we predicted at the top of the show auburn throwing more passes than usual georgia has some problems in the secondary that we will document for you georgia when they had the football managed to accumulate minus five yards in three plays some indication of the tough defense being played by the Tigers second and ten from the 29 yard line and this time Jackson carries and ball skirts his way through with a penalty marker going down to the 38 yard line but lawyer Tillman number 85 the wide receiver may have been in motion will get the call illegal procedure that is the indication the referee today is joe hicks he heads the Southeastern Conference crew and that the gates Jackie's would be eight yard pickup illegal procedure motion against the offense fiveyard penalty it's second down and 15 with a ball of the 24 yard line Tilman comes out wide to the left and gayness goes to the other side and again it is Jackson looking for Rome and bursting forward out to the 36 yard line black and moss converged to make the tackle at least early on Lee it looks like no ill effects as far as that is concerned from a low angle you get a sense of the size the speed the strength the cutting ability of bo Jackson and when you look at him it's hard to get a sense that he's 225 pounds 6 to 225 four to speed in the 40yard death that was it a Decathlon performer in high school great allaround afternoon territory and written down John little making the tackle and that's the beauty of having Jackson trailing you on the option play the defense needs to think about the pitch and then Washington was able to turn it upfield himself that's exactly what happened to remember that Pat Washington was a wishbone quarterback last year he's running the option this time out of the I formation he picked up a good block from his fullback Tommie Agee number 30 and who's finally John little in the secondary who brings him back so to the 33 yard line first and 10 an exception skirting a tackle in the backfield and taking it inside the 30 yard line where Harris and Mitchell converge on the stop so Auburn moving steadily and quickly here in the first quarter with nine minutes 27 seconds to play and no score and meanwhile Jackson is now going out and Brent Poole it comes in forward spelling Jackson so the tailback number 22 who had three touchdowns against East Carolina last week on second down and seven from inside the 30 let's go by Bill Mitchell already number 56 and could be another procedure call but we'll wait sing mentally Walker at the line of scrimmage and it's offside against Georgia they apply outside we suspected was Henry Harris number 52 who was the guilty party and so instead of the loss with full wood carrying offer becomes the beneficiary of this fiveyard Markoff Finch Oh still second down and second down and two with Ag the fullback number 30 and full with the tailback number 22 at the line of scrimmage on a play that was very slow in developing and also I think the negligible gain or minimal loss was caused by some mistiming mixup in the ball handling I think they were trying to go with a hand back trap faking wide and then handing back to the fullback the quarterback didn't get his steps right so Washington was down to sink no gain third down and two if you're going to get out of sync that's a pretty good time to do it one second two in motion again flags go down on the end Howard was a man who jumped number 53 so ball teams having trouble getting timing down early on and the procedure call will cost him five that'll take it back to the 30 ID line and set up a third and seven now they did fall fire and Fulford by the offense third third and seven for the Tigers at the Georgia 30yard line Washington protected well wide open both in the area it was parks crossing the intended receiver covered by little on the play and Washington is now one out of four so a 47yard field goal defense of coming out for Chris Johnson who is their long kicker two of three and as long as a 46yard or against Florida this one for 47 fresh the beginning but a futile ending to that drive for Auburn Georgia gets the ball back with 749 to go in the first quarter I remember him well Frankie sink which won the Heisman Trophy in 1942 fireball Frankie swing sink which he had a teammate Charlie trippy who was also a great allpurpose player forties were some time for quarterbacks and running backs for the Bulldog at 43 years later as we come back to live action it is David McCluskey parroting straight up the middle my favorite mascot I got this is agha for if I'm not mistaken I'll go for look at three won a national championship in 1980 tough bark to funnel second and seven from the 33 yard line pretty Lane is imposing without pants before they online and has a first down vince dooley likes to use for running backs Worley and men and started and now McCluskey and Taylor in there this is tape from this low angle you get a sense of the speed and power of Lara's tape they have big fast backs there isn't a Herschel Walker here but there are some outstanding runners as he follows in behind Anderson and burrows number 69 first and 10 Bulldogs in the 41 yard line it's a scoreless first quarter to this point letsa key setting up on the right side they make that the strong side and mcklusky they stopped after a pickup of a couple Dave McCluskey a junior from Rome Georgia and let's check in without traveling at the side now I'm trying to get some insight into something Georgia calls the hydrant pattern and I've just got got just the tools to do it with me of course is the man you just saw her for I've got how do you feel about that has this game going to go how about this dog out well that was a fumble by Anka but we'll give him another shot later on second down and seven as Lange they ran to reverses in a 1714 win over baylor one for a touchdown the flow goes left but the reverse the lane comes back to the light the picket fence was well set up and all around the team gets a book good block from Strozier before Thomas number 41 brings him down after a 16 yard gain first and 10 Georgia at the 40 I'd line 543 to go in the quarter again it's Adamski's setting up as the tight end on the right side the play goes that way but not very far as McCluskey is wrapped up by Harold Holman out of the middle number 94 only one of the smaller players on a team 511 but a blocky 234 small but very very strong Hallman williams and rocker pretty much interchangeable there along the front wall that is considered the strength of the Auburn defense second and 11 from the 41 yard line pitch it she gets to the 34yard line McCluskey leading the way for large tape number 32 hunker down you hairy dog let the big dog eat he gobbled up quite a few yards they may not have a big dog but they got some pretty goodlooking pups and putting those two freshmen working out in the backfield on third down and three from the 33 yard line Tate the nine McCluskey cuts back inside at the 33 yard line by Pak Thomas number 41 who is starting in place of Edward Phillips at that linebackers fine Phillips out with a bruised kidney Coleman Williams rocker the interior line for Auburn have been dominating defensively this time leading the way that Thomas actually winds up making the tackle so on fourth down now Georgia with a field goal attempt upcoming Steve from Lee a freshman for as long as this year is 46 yards this a 51 yard attempt from the 41 yard line is long enough but it is wide wide to the right so two long field goals missed one by each side after two drives that started in promising fashion but they both come up empty and we're still scoreless with 348 to play effect the national championship picture less than three minutes to go in Columbus Ohio Wisconsin the last team to beat the Buckeyes at home back in 82 could do it again leading 12 7 late meanwhile Iowa has come from down 147 to go ahead of Purdue 21 to 14 and so the Hawkeye's are for the moment safe they had by a touchdown hey trout wig how about going over and feeding that War Eagle Lynn Swann tried to do that last year we almost lost it that's right well trout wig is on his way over to that War Eagle if that War Eagle is here tracee rocker number 74 the freshman out of Atlanta Georgia shaken up on the sidelines as Auburn is at the 34 yard line Jackson is back in the game to the 36yard line take Richardson number 99 makes the tackle run some scores in for you Michigan a winner 48 to 700 Minnesota Boston College takes care of Syracuse the Mountaineers are a 13point winner over temple Florida squeaking by Kentucky after that loss last week Florida comes back to win but only by two and we told you about Tennessee and Mississippi earlier on second and eight it is Jackson Hubbard maybe nice play by that shot for for his hometown right here that's the best place to stop bo Jackson before he crosses the line of scrimmage because when he gets up steam he has a lot of tools for to speed his worldclass sprinter speed despite the fact that he weighs 225 pounds 240 to go first quarter no score third down throwing into the back of one of his own men Kenny Sims number 57 breaking up the play so Washington has shown a couple of balls and heaven roundup as a completion and Auburn the king Louis Kolbert with kicks with a clubfoot and despite what would be considered a handicap by many a forty five point one average as he is up among the nation's leaders in that department and John little is the deep man for Georgia standing back to the Tony freeride line good high deep kick again this one's a beauty and they let it bounce and Auburn will try to down in and it takes a great offer Gary Kelly covers it my covert gamble was made by little and he signaled for the fair catch then let it bounce hoping he would go into the endzone it turned out to be a 64 yard punt next week three Eastern Time the big ade confrontation the muchanticipated one Nebraska Oklahoma that's our CFA presentation for you a week from today corrected score Syracuse beats Boston College not the other way around Zurich is 41 BC 21 giorgia first and ten and Jackson seeks in breathing space and gets out to the 5yard line two minutes to go in the period Georgia Tech still in the hunt in the ACC beats Wake Forest in Atlanta today handling Virginia knocks off North Carolina by two Appalachian stayed over Marshall Henderson and Worley are the running backs the two freshmen marker down before the inception of the play in Jo Hicks heading the crew here Tulsa Beach East Carolina by three touchdowns SMU had their hands full today but the Mustangs prevail over Texas Tech as the penalty goes against Georgia after the penalty half the distance to the end zone it is second down and nine the Auburn cheering section the Auburn fan seated right behind Georgia right now might have been instrumental and somebody not hearing the count on second and nine mistiming again does no damage Keith Henderson takes the ball out to the eight yard line Jackson bumping into Henderson that's the type of play that off times results in a fumble this time he's able to bring it out to the eight it was a little slow with his reverse pivot and he almost put it on his hip instead of in his belly Henderson of course the man who broke the long one last week in the game against Florida 76 yard touchdown followed by a 32yard touchdown who the 13yard line and we'll see where they spotted it appears to me as if he has the first down then mccurdy in on the tackle and he does it's a first down for Georgia let's check in with a trout again now it's the last time I listen to Jim Lampley I'm going to try and feed the War Eagle who's the fifth one not interested in eating a dog biscuit yeah it's a good thing we don't through teams with nicknames of occupier giant squid or something Crowley would go everywhere first down from the 13 yard line Jackson hands the ball off to Henderson out to the 16 yard line for a gain of three by the way that eagle is a tiger that's his name trying to keep our mascot straight up here today meanwhile is another penalty flag thrown but war eagle is not a mascot that is a crime Tigers are the official mascot delay a game call against Georgia the ticky tacky penalties here in the first period nothing major a lot of fiveyard Markoff to delay and walk side illegal motion right now it is first and 15 from the 8 yard line and it's Keith Henderson who comes out of Cartersville Georgia carrying for a couple and that could be the final play of the first period well as we figured it would be a fast game a running game and tough defense would be featuring battle of the trenches that's what it's been in Georgia breaks the huddle but they do not figure to have the time to get the play off and in fact they do so that is in of the first period each team mounted a drive that started promising ly but ended with long missed field goal attempts and so in 15 minutes gone in this great traditional battle in Athens Auburn and Georgia are scoreless corner is about to start in Athens Georgia Al Michaels with league Rose Cup and Al trot wig at Sanford Stadium vince dooley in his 22nd season watching his team with the ball second down and 12 from the 10yard line and action after from the loom at the 32yard line recovered by lover ruch character comes up for the football number 47 sprin out left by the quarterback jaxon he's looking for osborne number 24 who's running a middle ground ball is caught successfully great hit by jimmy warren number 45 dislodges the football is free and along comes Russ character number 47 gives a very opportune field position first half of the Tigers at the georgia 33 yard line it's full would the tailback wrapped up at the 33yard line led by Steve Boswell the defensive judge number 44 who missed the first three games this year with injuries he's a junior from Warner Robins Georgia so as we said at the top turnover certainly would be one of the keys today and statistics have proven out that when you get the ball in this kind of field position you should score 65 percent of the time second and 10 from the 33 yard line and not much cooking in the middle and it's Boswell who's been like a Mackin on the last two plays number 44 making the tackle grandpa what is a junior Florida so as Pat dye looks on he knows that next year when Jackson is gone it'll be forward who will be picking up the burden he is a good one question is will they stay with the iformation or go back to the ball I ran the wishbone in the first three years third down makes the forward and then throw speed please ready nearly came up with a ball after the juggling act with John little covered on the play and it's incomplete deep dropped by Washington and he's looking for Wade number fourteen on a crossing pattern ball juggled twice look momentarily like he may have caught the ball but I think you're gonna see it touched the ground there's the juggle there's a second juggle he never had possession a good call Chris Johnson to attempt a 50yard field goal he was wide from 51 and this one good just long enough and he hits it over so admission from 51 and hits from 50 takes advantage of the turnover after the bubble recovery they lead three nothing Ohio where Wisconsin has snapped Ohio State's 20 game home winning streak more importantly the Buckeyes have surrendered the inside track to the Rose Bowl Iowa need only win today against Purdue and next week against Minnesota for Chuck long to have the trip to Pasadena he so badly wanted out all yours Jim not only that Chuck long may wind up with a Heisman Trophy as well that's a good point and we'll get into that as this one continues on in terms of the Heisman situation in bo Jackson and Chuck long and Robbie Bosco and right now warm me have the inside track as well as I Johnson to kickoff with Auburn on top three nothing a good deep kick so deep in back that goes through the end zone and out to the 20 come to Georgia Bulldogs Jackson led in that race but long has been gaining ground and long had had one bad outing on national television they thought he was over and done with as far as the was concerned but uh meanwhile Monday night we can tell you a good one the New York Giants on top along with Dallas and the NFC East to take on the Washington Redskins our presentation on Monday Night Football at 9:00 Eastern Time that rivalry dates back to 1932 and I can tell you there's some tradition in that one meanwhile we had another penalty flag on the kickoff kick over an offside call another one against Auburn and so we'll find out if that affects Johnson again who quoted that one all the way through the end zone and has just kicked the 50 yard field goal for the game's first point well you've heard that statistics can be misleading but I think these stats are rather indicative of what kind of game it's been if you look at the total yards 69 for Auburn 47 for Georgia no turnovers and time of puts at possession virtually equal that kind of game we thought it would be Bulldogs came in slightly favorite Auburn has a three nothing lead by the way the official county 49yard field goal is what johnson is credited with Valda Shyam strike of 40 and another flag goes down this time because the tick is out of balance funny the fates and fortunes of a field goal kicker and the kickoff man a guy who just kicks a 49yard field goal then boots one on the fly through the end zone kicks the next one out of bounds at the 25yard line when he has all that time no one's rushing nicotine was all fried on the kickoff fiveyard pill then we'll kick over offside as well the flag went down for the kick going out of bounds but now we're being told off side as well on the kickoff so it wouldn't matter had he booted it through again crazy penalty to see twice in a row in your tenth team of the year back to the 30man Johnson to kick a spleen for who's back beef along with Jaxson Johnson this time it's a line drive to hopper filled in at the age bye Jackson the pants 225 to the 33yard line goes and that's where the Bulldogs will begin this drive hit me top 10 in for you now Penn State has drawn first blood against Notre Dame 7 nothing there Nebraska rolling over Kansas 42 3 we told you about Wisconsin at Ohio State and that's shocker the air force in the third period leading from the 33 I line with Jackson and quarterback James on a roll to his left going off balance mechanics for the in bounds it'll be second down and 10 from the 33 college football the rule states that must be impounded he is clearly out of bounds there no problem with a zebra there Iowa 5th ranked leading Purdue 21 17 in the second Oklahoma over Colorado 14 to nothing that game in the third quarter second and 10 Bulldogs from the 33 yard line Auburn ahead three nothing Jackson protected well completed Jimmy Hockaday number 85 this is the type of play that James Jackson needs Hockaday in front of Kevin quarter number three races toward the sideline and Johnson finally bring him down there was talk that Jackson might be replaced by Wayne Johnson early on first and 10 from the 40 yard line after a 28 yard game gets ripped at the line of scrimmage Gary killing of a 42 cocked item from this low angle you really get a sense of what it's like down in the trenches as Gary Kelly number 42 way to keep layer layer on a punt really gets a shot on the ball curve second down and 10 from the 39 yard line Sadowski sets up on the left side and they roll the other way Jackson first and ten and the 25 tape four five I stopped by Arthur Johnson Julie likes the alternator's running backs he has Worley and Henderson working as a pair and Tate and McCluskey who are in there now working in tandem and Jackson has the hot hand right now he was one of three for 23 yards moments ago now he is three for five for 65 yards second and five 11:15 to go in the hand Auburn leading green up and second and five close to a first down David McCluskey a junior from Rome Georgia both to fullback last year he was a tailback his first season here good blocking back in addition to doing a pretty decent job when he has the football he is shy of the first down by inches it's er down less than one outside the 15yard line Heath Anderson the third back inserted the and McCluskey so a first down at the 13 yard line Keith Henderson it was an allamerican tale back in high school recruited as a tailback has made the adjustment and moved to fullback with a great deal of efficiency from the 14 yard line Jackson nice take Pete its to the 5yard line and all from this angle it's going to be very clear that what I like what Jackson does here is that he sees when he's to keep the ball he protects him puts that extra hand in there there's the facemask right there clearly by number nine of Auburn and that's Powell the free safety he was close to a first anyway and they go halfway to the goal line from the spot of the infraction to put it at the two and its first and goal again out of the power I with Worley in there as the tailback it's whirling he is stopped inside the two yard line Tim Worley run out of bounds that time by Tracy rocker number 74 in fact he was not they spot the ball just inside the three under ten minutes to go in the half Auburn but Georgia rabbit second down and goal Jackson James Jackson is the hero of this drive so it's fitting that he should take it into the end part two of the option like he saw daylight got a good block from McCluskey number 43 and outran Thomas to the end zone extra point by Steve crumbly is perfect and with 951 to go in the half a drive has started with pretty decent field position after the penalties have negated that kick through the end zone by Auburn dog marks down the field to take the lead bo Utah where after a Bosco to Bellini touchdown pass late in the third quarter Bosco threw back to lynly on this pass from 8 yards out after a penalty for the twopoint conversion which has now tied the cougars up with the falcons of air force 21 apiece al michaels well that's turned out to be a beauty and it figured to be and maybe the most important game in the history of the Western Athletic Conference and a game not being seen by too many people but it's turned out to be a gym here at 7 to 3 Georgia on top Oh run out of bounds by Aaron Sherman so the Auburn Tigers will begin their drive deep in their own territory it was hard to imagine that game not being apart for Air Force BYU I said not being seen by too many people in light of the fact that it's not on network television and it was picked up by Kurt Goudy productions great cowboy televising takes it out past the 20 two yard line both picking up six and John Cranley makes the stop Georgia scoring drive right there convincing at the 32 yard line James Jackson the obvious hero of that drive but maybe the unsung hero would be David McCluskey the fullback number 43 who had two key blocks on the drive second down and four from the 22 26 where Brantley makes the tackle and bow is close to a first down we know it's Bosco coming on in that game and we were talking about long and Jackson before those are the three man as both picks up the first down who would be the Heisman favorites and it is going to be a very interesting little tussle here to determine who wins the Heisman Trophy first down from the 27 Washington coaching black out at the 30yard line after a gain of three contrast to last year Lee and his clutches everybody conceded the Heisman to Doug Flutie it was a foregone conclusion and Doug picked it up but this year it's a scramble he becoming the first quarterback to win the Heisman Trophy since Pat Sullivan Auburn player who you interviewed at halftime last year in the Auburn Alabama game so a fat here today does the games on the Alabama radio network on the Auburn Radio Network in the state of Alabama 33 yard line and it will be third down and four for the Auburn Tigers as we have reached the halfway mark in the second quarter seven and a half minutes to play in the first half Georgia on top 73 so here we have a third and what might be a passing situation but it could also be a running situation which one of those third and four and a half from the tailback 8004 back depicts breaks a couple attack territory five to 20 and he'll go all the way touchdown Jetson he must have heard us talking about the Heisman that's how you win the heisman like that goat must have heard us talking serve down you pitch the ball to Bo Jackson brakes and tackle there now watch as he traverses and you see some of that four through speed he picks up a block from Trey Janus a key block in the secondary and then he just coasts into the end zone Chris Johnson's point after he's good after the explosion by beau 67yard Gallup it's ten to seven offers tene 69 to 1971 this man did it all we were talking moments ago about Pat Sullivan his favorite receiver in those days was Terry Beasley but Sullivan rewrote the press guide for Auburn got the Heisman in 1971 and until Doug Flutie won the award last year he was the only quarterback to win that for many many years Auburn leads 10 to 7 final laying Bo Jackson's four years at Auburn and that's the first touchdown he has scored against Georgia and he does it in pretty spectacular fashion as Johnson's kick is down in the end zone and Georgia will take over at the 20 yard line to begin this next drive with 703 to go there he is Bo Jackson who has now carried 10 times for a hundred thirteen yards he would that deep thigh bruise has been hurt the past couple of weeks and has limited his playing time as a consequence it's the first time he has been over a hundred yards since the Mississippi State game which preceded the contest with Florida and East Carolina Jackson is the quarterback Worli takes it out to the 24 yard line after Osbourne had been the man moving on the planet second down and seven beau was already the career rushing later he passed up James Brooks earlier this four thousand forty yards coming into today's game Brooks had 3523 second and six and the new quarterback is Wayne Johnson Tracy rocker the fact that Johnson is in the game doesn't mean a whole lot about Jackson vince dooley was saying that he likes to get johnson in at least for a series or two in the first half mentioned earlier that Tracy rocker of Brush Minh is really the catalyst of a strong defensive line for the Tigers he chases down Johnson good pursuit there he had 72 tackles and 4 sacks coming into today's game so Johnson who is the opening night starter a redshirt freshman out of Columbus Georgia asks for and receives a timeout here preparatory to a third and 10 call from the 20 yard line 550 to go in the half with Auburn on top by 3 at hand sign of course will bring you uptodate on all of the scores including some big upsets today Wisconsin highlighting that particular category with a victory over Ohio State all coming up at the half meanwhile there's bo Jackson a 67 yard touchdown galloped he's up in over a hundred yards today I've been battled but it's more than that even though a lot of the stories territory this game who would win the heisman among those who will tell you hey we're here to win the ballgame not to win me the Heisman necessarily it would be a nice byproduct but Auburn thinking about a W they lead 10 to 7 Georgia national football third and ten at the 20 I'd line Johnson runs into his own man Tracy rocker literally rocked them I passed the boundary and that lame hit if indeed that is the call they need a first down for Georgia from the end zone you might get a better look and see if it is indeed a late hit by Tracy rocker number 74 that's that's on the fringe jakey jakey calls on the boundary but it's also on the print yeah he rocked that little baby to sleep not quite sure I throw the flag there and they're going to march it off now and it's going to be close to a first down but just short of the first down because the 29th a late hit out of bound by the defense it's an automatic first down so an automatic first down is what it is that might be a big play that's the kind of play it's a sort of I think back and say the game formed good very well yes they would have forced Georgia to punt and with time running down in the first half Auburn may have been able to control the football the rest of the way or at least most of the rest of the way in the sand up the middle goes Henderson and he takes it out to the 37 yard line when you get a break like that the elephants sometimes fires up the whole momentum of the game changes Georgia has not been nice to opponents here in this stadium particularly in the decade of the 80s second down three from the 37 yard line it's Osbourne lining up on a wing for the right out to the 43 yard line then mccurdy making the tackle under five minutes now remaining in the half and a first down remember the Bulldogs still thinking about a South Eastern Conference championship it's possible but they do need some help Tennessee would have to lose to either Kentucky or Vanderbilt after the 48 and naturally Georgia would have to win this game let's go down trow away now I've decided to really see what it's like between the hedges these were put here at Sanford Stadium in 1929 by a mr. Charlie Martin who wanted this Stadium to look like the Rose Bowl and of course to really be between the hedges here at Sanford you've got to be on the playing field back to you trap we always had the feeling you were between something we weren't quite sure what second and five from the 48 yard line that late hit penalty made through very very long kenderson number 30 who as he did last week so effectively against Florida takes the quick inside dive play gets in behind burrows and Anderson the bell cow Center really turns it into a big gainer before Tom Powell one of the best players in the secondary makes the tackle first down from the 36 guideline the 30 killed who takes the ball for a gain of two Powell comes up from the safety spot to make the tackle Anderson we talked about his nickname is a bell cow it's Dooley feels that he is as good as any Center he has ever coached he said in the last nine weeks he's playing about as well as any offensive lineman he's ever had there is the man we thought about that elected not to run for the United States Senate earlier this year second and seven so it'll be third down and seven coming up on a very big call here for Johnson in the Bulldogs is the clock ticks down to 255 Auburn on top came to seven late in the first half why to the right Tate is the tailback Smith sets up as the tight end of the right side miss Johnson firing and those two guys Johnson and Hockaday weren't on the same page that time we have here is a breakdown in communication Johnson thought that Hockaday was running a deep comeback pattern to the outside Hockaday was running a fly pattern and the result is an incompletion and also a 51yard field goal attempt coming for steam Crumley now who missed a 50yarder earlier snap is good and the kick is blocked and it's picked up at the 45 yard line and hurdling down the sidelines with a flag going down is number 93 that's brewed Andre Bruce and Kevin Porter is the man who blocked it Porter came flying a flag is down an official went down and I'm wondering if he threw the flag or whether the flag just came out when he was knocked down inadvertent dropping ugly Kevon quarter numbers is coming from the outside and this is classic right here you can give a clinic on this one now it's Andre Bruce number 93 who does a good job of hurdling right there that didn't quite look like Edwin Moses when I'm relatively impressed first down at the 38yard line with 216 to go mental in the first half and washington giving the ball the for inside the 30 24 yard line run out by Gary Morris and that's your backup to back folks we know how good Bo Jackson is but this is one of the best backup tailbacks in all of college football number 22 Brett forward makes a little stutter step Juke step to the outside he's got the wiggle he got the wobble and he had 642 yards coming into this game first down for the Tigers at the 24 yard line Washington keeps and to a seven or eight yard game in his pack takes into the 17 are burning tremendous shape right now they're not only deep in Georgia territory they have all their timeouts left and they elect to use one here but they can if they judiciously make the right calls eat up much of the clock and leave Georgia with no time on the other side if they do indeed score they lead by three Georgia Al Michaels League rosca al Trautwig with you 154 left on the clock in the half Auburn a hit by three and the Tigers have the football at the georgia 17 yard line second down three so packed I whose team is trying to win it's 18 and 10 watching his quarterback now Washington with forward running back in this set and he gives it the full wood behind some nice blocking but it doesn't develop John Graham he made a nice play looked like bull would had a couple of horses out in front of him but no room developed well the Clydesdales were out in front but forward can't get started he's hip there by number 42 John Brantley the line he's known as Rambo now it is third and one in Auburn looking toward the bench the entire unit there was some confusion and thus they are forth to use a timeout that's not exactly what you wanted to do right here you got a third one coming up and you can take some time off the clock so with time out here let's pay a visit to the campus of Auburn Dyer for a learning experience that will prepare them for a meaningful career there's an atmosphere here that promotes new ideas and creative thinking a college education begins with a strong faculty and a bright group of students and Auburn professors take the time to give their students the attention they need to develop their minds so that those who leave are better prepared to adapt to an everchanging world or perhaps even to change it during that break Washington had the headset on in the sidelines he talked to the coaches upstairs talking about taking time off the clock adjust to elaborate what you want to do of course is you want to score you want to get a touchdown if not a field goal the only thing two of your Auburn his take as much time off the clock response leave Georgia no time coming back the other way with this in a minute 20 to go it's third and one with a ball at the 15 yard line and Washington picks up the first down he gets to the 11 stopped there by Tony flack and now the clock will stop momentarily on the first down Washington effective once again on the option play and we will remind you that he was indeed a wishbone quarterback in 1984 we've covered him twice in 1984 when he was running the bowl it was the idea in the bone is that you outnumber your opponent first and ten from the 11 and Washington to throw nearly has a quick bar Gregg Williams number 23 who does not have that much experience in the secondary but it is an injury wracked secondary for Georgia on the pass intended for Freddie Wade and wagon Williams matchup there trying to hit way Gantt on a deep slant pattern and is nearly picked off by number 23 Gregg Williams who's playing a key role today as he fills in in that injured secondary that we talked about earlier that was one of the concerns of coaching Vince Dooley when I talked to him earlier this week second and 10 pull back of aging and run out of bounds at the 8 yard line by Tony flack so now it is third down jumping up from the eighth it's third down and about seven for the first eight for the touch 52 seconds to go in the half and one timeout for Auburn and I was wondering I was just going to answer the question he and they Co sent Jackson in and the answer here comes bow right up if you don't give him the ball at least he get in the defense something to really think about you pointed out earlier it helps the quarterback on the option flow because on number 34 they give it to ball he runs through the middle as a flag thrown Jackson gets to the oneyard line but a penalty marker was thrown in fact there are there was one thrown after the inception of the play I think there's gonna be a holding Pro and there was also a penalty marker thrown by the linesman at the line of scrimmage two flags are down the defensive team offside holding by the offense the offset whoa boy I was half right so the holding call that would have been a big break for the Bulldogs are they not lined up offside instead now it's third and a short seven at the 8 yard line 47 seconds to go first half Auburn leading Georgia 10 to 7 last time they had a third and such a wet third and long situation like this they pitched the ball to Jackson in motion and a reverse its way game coming the other way times touchdown what a play what up to look like he was going to get and that's out in the back of the playbook and that was a thing of beauty a good point because this is unfair think of Auburn football to use a gadget play in this situation normally they're very fundamental now watch braless number 78 he wisely does not quit there on dairy moss number three but gets in the way and that Springs him for the touchdown and Johnson kicks the extra point Florida State again driving into the end zone and let's visit the campus of Georgia that was really a great call by Pat dye and also a very wellconceived play think about what the defense has to think about you thinking about Jackson you're also thinking about Washington maybe keeping the ball the last thing you're thinking about is wig in the real key to this play however at the tail end is number 78 Wallace screening off number 59 Waters would have been so easy for him to clip there but he just stood there screened him off and then enabled weygand to get in for an eightyard touchdown executed nicely also you saw him fake to Agee so in fact the defense had to think about AG had to think about Washington may be keeping obviously had to think about Jackson and the next thing you know you got a Wiggy and running the other way love that call Mac to kick off a little squibber George I'm having trouble coming up with a football with maintaining possession at the 23 yard line and it's pretty Lane hanging on to it with 23 seconds to go in the half and Georgia with two timeouts left let's see it again at the end of this one pointed out earlier the key to this is the screen by Wallace on waters that enables Regan to slip by and break into the end zone and he has to break one more tackle that's by Gary Moss number three but I agree with it was a great call uncharacteristic of Pat dye and Auburn football but to see that baby diagrammed on the short court from the 23 yard line first and 10 Johnson is still in the quarterback we're going to keep it on the ground with McCluskey so the Bulldogs will not go to the air they'll be content to go into the dressing room down by 10 at the half one of the reasons he can come up with a call like that is because he now has offense with the iformation well all of the scoring in the first half takes place in the second quarter and the teams go to the locker rooms at Sanford Stadium on a warm day as we approach five o'clock in the evening it still feels like it's in the upper 70s 80 mm looking on 17 to 7 to score let's go to Al trout when Pat died all right now coach he must be fairly proud of that call you made for Wygant who scored that touchdown that was a rarity I didn't make that call Jack probe made that call in the press box and I did actually I told I was upset because we ran him because there's a third down play I worn a bowl and sit on the field if we if we didn't make a first down so we kick a field goal but it was a great goal that now that it worked what did he see that forced him to make that call well they had been running everybody to the motion out of own unbalanced line it is working Jess he's like like it it worked at in Florida some other folks hope when they work is a great call when they don't but all those fans been on Jack crow give him a little credit go he made the call it was great give me the highlights and lowlights for the first half for Auburn well I think the low wasn't for us well certainly to file a nonfamily out of bounds over there that we had them backed up and they probably look at the long run bye boo and that you know put us ahead picked our people up and we got a lot of football left to play Georgia's got a great football team and and we are trying to to get there all right you're on your way Thank You coach so far it's ten seven seventeen seven to correct that we'll be back with halftime in a moment teen seven when we return on ABC's college football the kickoff for the second half CFA college football this ABC Sports exclusive is brought to you by the US Army a place to be on you can be and by Mesa builders of technologically advanced cars and trucks for over 50 years so we are about ready to start the second half Auburn leading Georgia's 17 to 7 and again just to set the scene again in the SEC Tennessee controls its destiny they go to the Sugar Bowl if they win their next two games Georgia still has a chance if Tennessee were to lose or tie one of its remaining two with Kentucky or Vanderbilt but they still have to win this one do the Bulldogs and they're down by 10 as we start the second half Chris Johnson to kick things off for Auburn Freddy Lane and Truong Jackson are the deep end for the Bulldogs at the goal line Jackson on your lap beep kick through the end zone George's starting at the 20 let's look at the offer defense Gerald Robinson the defensive end number 95 then the freshman we've been talking about through the first half rocker Hallman 511 234 squat the very good Gerald Williams outstanding number 98 Pat Thomas one linebacker had a good first half rust character number 47 a sophomore from America's Georgia and Gary Kelly on the outside number 42 Bulldogs at the 20 Jackson is back in Andrew Johnson had finished up the hand the quarterback and James turns and gives it to the first day of school Keith Henderson for a gain of two Kevin Porter is one quarterback Jimmy Warren number 45 the other and then the strong safety Arthur Johnson the free safety is Tom Powell who has six interceptions this season he's up amongst the country leaders second down and eight the two freshmen Worley and Henderson Worley is the tailback Jackson looks back the other way and hits Herman Archie boring in front of Cooley he is the dogs offensively Jackson and Worley and men mission but we'll see a lot of tape in mcklusky Israel Hockaday and laying on the wideouts Sadowski the tight end and there's the rest of the line first down after a 12year I'd pick up all of the 34 yard line Jackson to the air again hits Worley the freshman out of Lumberton North Carolina look at Worley from his tailback position on a little swing pass it's what's known as a slip screen and what makes it work here is a block to the outside then he makes a cut back here you see some of the moves in the open field speed that has made him so explosive he has four four speed in the 40yard dash Henderson takes the ball just about to the 50 yard line it'll be second and seven and let's look at the hand ton number I pointed out in the first quarter how everything was pretty much equal well look at what's happened here as a result of what happened in the second quarter Auburn now taking the lead in total yards particularly in rushing yards 171 to 103 mostly as a result of the big play by bo Jackson second and seven eightyseven Sadowski this is where Jackson is particularly effective because of his threat as a runner he's looking for Sadowski number 87 who's running a sideline cut he takes the ball and then does a hook slide just under Tom Powell was he safe he got the call first our Bulldogs at the 36 yard line fakes and the keeper that's nothing Gerald Robinson number 95 gets credit for that tackle early third quarter Auburn on top 17 7 and the Bulldogs trying to narrow the gap to 3 second and ten Bulldogs at the auburn 36 Worley Nina for Tracy rocker number 74 makes the tentacle rocker who standing first half off to a good start now in the second as well Florida squeaked by Kentucky 1513 Tennessee two wins away now from the Sugar Bowl they beat Ole Miss Alabama does in seven Mississippi by 11 third and seventh Jackson unable to handle it Hockaday off his fingertips on what would have been a first down completion Hockaday appears to lose his concentration here because this ball is thrown pretty well to the outside on the sidelines that is just where it should be thrown low and outside Hockaday who has been their most consistent receiver not a big play man but a guy you normally think would make that catch very easily so now Crumley will attempt the 50yard field goal he missed one from 15 he had one block from 51 so a third long attempt this time he gets the kick away in a careerbest for the freshman who's long has had been for two and Georgia is now within 70 so Steve crumbly following in the footsteps of a pretty good one Kevin Butler who was here for four years into the great job and Butler is now the kicker for the unbeaten Chicago Bears Bramley after his 50 yard field goal the kick go on short angled pick field it at the 20 by Kyle Collins and he runs it back out to the 29 yard line and look at a word without route way al no question as you've mentioned this is one of the great traditions of the south or Vernon Georgia first playing in 1892 but the University of Georgia was founded in 1785 it is now celebrating his 200th anniversary the city of Athens wasn't named until 1806 and by that time it was already the center of culture and education and the founding fathers of the city felt that it should be named after the city of Athens in Greece which was already for centuries a cultural and educational center back to you thank you sure good history lesson from the 28 yard line first and 10 tries to exploit a hole in the middle and comes close to getting the first down he's out too close to the 38 Calvin ruff the defensive end as we look at the Bulldogs defensive tackle Henry Williams 237 founder Henry Harris waves to 69 Jake Richardson is in 257 pounds senior Greg waters buddy himself at 234 Bill Mitchell leads the team in tackles at a door George if John Brantley a sophomore linebacker plays the other side at a Wildwood Florida they measure it's that close and his second down Greg runner says don't call me buddy call me mr. waters Kerwin Bell will do that after last week and in 632 34 if he wants us to do it we will accede to his request as well he's our hostage second and an inch at the 38yard line 11 Giorgi 17 they let go do it Phil Mitchell pool make sure a bowl couldn't get started defensive backfield Gary washes one corner and then Greg Williams starting at the other today John little is the strong safety and Tony flack the serious looking flack the free safety thirds name face yeah 32 the crowd rises as one according the dog defense and extension who Tony black Rick with Mitchell beat these dogs some bully bones look at the swarming look of the Georgia split 60 feet fence here led by Tony Fleck number 88 Calvin ruff number 86 black number 8 in the secondary was up there very fast Louis Gohmert to do the kicking that's a tremendous emotional boost for the Georgia Bulldogs but they just did wobbly kick line drive pointed to 23 second and eight and third the ball back in 1980 1981 and 1982 there was no runner in college football to compare with this man number 34 Herschel Walker the cry here was let the big dog eat he did a lot of yards and the Heisman Trophy 1982 40 years after fireball Frankie sink which had won the Heisman Trophy for these same Georgia Bobo you mentioned 80 81 82 they're very few better runners in 85 as well John high school of course was the Auburn coach that was back in 1895 for 1899 so now Walker is alma mater Georgia with the football at the 37 yard line first down and a football a scramble for the ball in Georgia V James possession but Jackson ran into McCluskey back time put the Bulldogs have it back this is just a mix up in the backfield start down on the option play mcklusky should not be there if they're running the lead option he should be leading outside fortunately it's burrows number 69 the right guard who is alert enough to see the fumble there cover the football and save the drive second and 13 and Loras Kate gets it back near the original Linus rivers 2:37 and upcoming will be a third and ten for the Bulldogs on the subject of Heisman Trophy winners there's a man who hopes that he has that baby in his showcase pretty soon comparisons are obvious mr. Lee says they're like twins he said his same size same speed played all around same number same number third and ten undry Bruce number 93 stopping them with a ten to play in the period so Georgia to punt well Jackson needed 369 yards coming into today's game to surpass first Perl Walker's SEC rushing part rehearsal did it in three seasons Chris Carpenter who had a 57yard beauty in the first quarter hasn't kicked since but he comes down with it very hightech not nearly as much distance as the last time fair catch call for a made by George at the 27yard line the reason for the flag contact made by Mike Brown number 49 stop was only a 34yard booth let's watch Mike Brown number 49 well no competition he was too close to us too that's a real to receive it against okay continue don't know about that call but they March it off anyway to the 32 that's where our burn has the ball for Georgia Mike Brown the rover back it's too close to number 19 tre gayness the receiver here you must allow him the allotted yardage two yards is the ruling which states two yards must be allowed on the cap it was awfully close first down Auburn as AG who normally serves as the blocking bank occasionally gets to carry the ball takes it up the middle final score and what must have been a wild one Air Force had to lead but back come the Cougars to beat airforce hey and the Falcons their first loss Brigham Young 20 80 Air Force 21 second down and six from the 36 Washington fires complete for a first down Scott Bolden who makes his first catch of the day number 24 and he is out of bounds at the 47 yard line just to give you the ruling on that fair catch no player of the kicking team PB within two yards of a player position to catch a scrimmage picked while the ball is even the downwards place the receiver must be given a nonetheless that opportunity to catch a kick so it flows right onto margin calls and as it turns out it only cost a 5yard first down from the 47 yard line Washington get back in 243 by Paul Giles a freshman out of Monroe Georgia 6 for 267 pound freshman the purpose of course of most rules in college football is for safety when the game first got started back in 1876 there were 61 rules today there are 748 rules with 79 exceptions if they do it to confuse announcement sometime and about 4,000 different interpretations of said rules second and fourteen from the 43yard line buhbye freakiness and he is at about at a guideline drei gayness good catch Burhan Japan Georgia territory tree gayness a junior split in has been one of the most consistent receivers for Auburn not normally a passing team he's running a crossing route here this is one of Washington's better passes has thrown a little bit behind him but it is into the open area of the coverage good job of reaching back in the secondary and gain has finally run out along the sideline by mom first down Tigers at the Bulldog 22 536 to play third period offered with the ball in a sevenpoint lead whoa Tony flack and Calvin RuPt converging bow can do bow cannot do on that way second down and ten two good defensive teams a lot of times when you get to the bugs go to jail a defense you have a dull game it's been anything but second at 10:00 at 223 Jackson again nobody can lay down a block rock and moss in on the staff but so roughest topping price in a row for the last time last time we covered a game here in Athens we had a good run for that was in 1978 29:28 Georgia Georgia Tech dogs one on the last play of the game HAMP Arnold twopoint play this game I think we've ever covered until tremendous comeback yeah I think that's the best name the most exciting game we've had him yep eight or nine years third down and 15 flags go down and the play is dead before the snap as Henry Harris came bolting through unless he was drawn off that'll be five against the dogs Bowling Green wins again in Bowling Green is still unbeaten Baylor still trying to win a berth in the Cotton Bowl leading Rice Texas still has a shot at the Cotton Bowl as well SMU UCLA trying to go to the Rose Bowl she leaves Washington 1713 in the third period Cougars running big there third and ten for the 23 Washington scream to Jackson he's inside the 20 the 15 the tan and bowl goes all the way down to a baffle one now spotted at the three yard line go Jackson the premier running back in all of college football and I think right here you can see why not only is he dangerous as a runner also as a receiver look at the open field ability after he gets the ball Juke step lift leg power speed he has it all one pro scout told me Bo Jackson graded out higher than any athlete he had ever put down on paper first and goal from the 3 that's Bo's first reception of the season and he has stopped at the truth driven back by Bill Mitchell number 56 amongst others tonight statistics something Billy Hayes points out to me that you wouldn't figure first time they've thrown to Bo Jackson this season the first time he's bought one anyway of course barbering and only thrown the ball and completed it on 70 two occasions in nine games that's eight completions again second and goal from the tool I'll give it the full winner replaces Jackson and rough and black converge on the tackle so a very big play coming up here third and goal postes on the sidelines forward is the tailback so the wide side of the field comes Washington Harris late on the tackle comes the fieldgoal unit this is a big defensive play by Harris as we look from the low angle here on the option play momentarily it appears that Washington has some room but Harris leaves a charge as a whole host of Georgia tacklers settle in to stop the play Chris Johnson the chip shot and Georgia gets it back crispin number 20 is the man with the block rusty peasley number 20 a Brisbane defensive back sixfoot 185 comes from the outside and makes a superlative effort there to block this kick and now the momentum seems to be springing back towards Georgia Auburn had scored on the last three possessions of the first half the ebb and flow of this one by seven Steve Easley the freshman in his most scintillating moment as a bulldog bigblock field goal attempt it's still 17 to 10 and next week well why should 1985 be any different every year it's always the same to Braska Oklahoma a huge one in the big 8 national play three o'clock next Saturday 3:00 eastern time on ABC Bulldogs have it 149 to go in the third quarter they trail by seven Worley after a gain of 1 Auburn 17 Georgia 10 second a call today picked up shulock for the 22 yard line that's lean in motion and it's him mission carrying the ball after the 25yard line when they on file and regroup it'll be third down and five with a minute now to go in the third quarter big third and five right now for the Bulldogs we had a scoreless first quarter Auburn led 17 7 at the half and only a long field goal by the dogs on the board here third and five that's in throwing and incomplete Herman Archie was not aim down no first down for the Bulldogs they'll have to kick it Herman Archie is tall at 65 and a dependable receiver he's running the sidelines cut it's clear that he is not inside the boundary in the kick Chris Carpenter creig anus is back at the 30yard line for Auburn very deep beautiful kick all the way back to the nineteen goes gayness tries to come back the other way and he stopped at the 23 yard line another great kick by carpenter twooutofthree forum 57 yards and a four yard run back and carpenters of freshman you think the pro scouts are looking at him 57 yards twice today he's done that in the air the freshman Giants and arrested a great game normally under any circumstance and particularly so now with the Giants trying to stay atop the NFC East along with Dallas and the Redskins in dire need of a victory to keep any hope alive of getting into the playoffs Monday night from the 23 with Washington a quarterback he gives it the full wood and he takes it out to the 28 yard line and that should be the final play of the period so the teams will change ends and we're sit up for what could be a fascinating final 15 minutes Robert leaves at 1710 and we'll be back after this commercial message and a word from your local station fleet gross gupa now trot wig in Athens Georgia Auburn hands the football as we start the fourth period they have the lead 1710 and his pant Washington leads them up at his second down and five from the 28 yard line Fullwood is still a tailback and he takes her Randall's out to a five to twenty nine yard line maybe the 30 but it will be third down and three upcoming Giles and Mitchell in on the tackle for the dogs spotted at the 29yard line third down four look at the play selection throughout the year you can see it dominated by the rush through the year and also today offer in 33 of 43 plays on the ground today Georgia 39 of 50 third and four from the 29 yard line Washington throwing Bank and at the 42yard line the catchers made by Jeff parks number 82 nice grab by parks on a low throw one of the things we talked about at the top of the show and we probably should restate it now is that path I indicated earlier that the work of Pat Washington would be very important they wanted to get some effective passing to balance out the running attack particularly the intermediate behind percentage passes that time he was right on the money throwing to Jeff parks number 82 Washington is now five of eleven for 93 yards at one nets 13 Washington pitching back projection Bo can occur in the corner stopped in the 46 yard line Gregg Williams mattoni black making the stop earlier we showed you a graphic illustrating the junction has been far more effective in terms of yardage gained in the first half of the second half it's somewhat deceiving though it really doesn't indicate he's getting tired what it indicates is that early on this season when he was having those big games he was coming out early in the third period on a couple of occasions unless his numbers are shifted toward the first half over waited in that direction second and seven Washington nice move to throw it to Jackson who gets into Georgia Territory the 40 the 30 yard line and ball gets to the 25 and Jackson who had not caught a pass in nine games this season has fought q in this hand and again it's the screen pass Jackson face the blast and then slides out on the left plan here again you see some of the open who's the speed the versatility Black's gotten to know him pretty well today and so has Boswell for what is back in as the tailback first and 10 to the 26 yard line AG age five age e last year had a big day against Georgia picking up 115 yards on nine carries today he's a deployable ocker short of a rest stop for the tailbacks second and five to 21 forward first down Auburn from this angle you can get a sense of the quickness of front forward the back up tailback one of the things vince dooley says is that the bad news that when Coach Jackson is out of there is that Brett Fullwood is in there and vice versa but you have a real tandem of tailbacks there between them they have over 2,000 yards rushing coming into this game forward another year of eligibility we'll be back next year Jackson wolf from the 14 for would again pitch inside became football he almost ripped up at the line winds up getting about e to the 6 yard line it'll be second and to the power I forward takes the ball with some depth now it's like a triple option for the tailback even going inside he can go straight Murray can go outside he breaks the tackle there another one there really throws a surge there and it's John little the rover back number 19 often compared to Terry Hope relevantly makes the tackle one of the Bulldogs is injured can I pick out exactly who it is for the Bowman but the clock is now stopped with 1202 remaining in the game and the Georgia defense which did a scintillating job the last time all burned got down deep stopping them and the injury is a minor one to Greg Williams who's in there because of other injuries Myles Smith replacing Tony flack black playing Williams spot and they've had a shift in juggling the rest of it as you look at some of the scores involving top 10 teams Iowa and Perdue look at that 124 Johnson's up to the Ohio State second and two years bull see you later what mercial Walker used to do here Bo Jackson is doing now look at the power one two three tackles mile smith gets the last Chris Johnson kicks the and the bulldogs are in a big hole again as Auburn methodically moves down the field Bowl goes in for his second score of the day we have 11:45 to go Harbor and back up on top by 14 now 24 to 10 with 11:45 to play in the game bo Jackson gets a breather as the defensive unit will take over bo has carried the ball 18 times for a hundred sixteen yards and two touchdowns and he's also caught a couple of key passes today Chris Johnson kicking off Lane and Jackson of the deep man the beauty again that's including all the way through the end zone and he's a freshman we've seen Johnson the freshman and also troubling the freshmen have their bulbs and Chris Carpenter as well with Georgia kickers dogs from the 20yard line James Jackson the quarterback in motion Lane comes back the other way and then Lane is at the receiving end of the pass the beans only one mar 13 2014 and a half then made a strong comeback second and nine with 21 yard line to the 40 he would be if you had a different chart the number five running back I like Sean Jackson I covered him last year in the ball game against Alabama where he was very effective sprint draw it's just a matter of using his speed as he gets to the outside before Tom Powell the free safety brings him down in the second it was pretty good for a third string tailback first down Jackson Hitachi he wanted to go little switch in the tempo of the game now for Georgia they've gotta start throwing the ball a little bit more on first and second down and step up the action because with 1051 left and trailing 2410 they can't worry too much about establishing a running game Bulldogs at the 48yard line first and ten swing pass is incomplete intended for at Ron Jackson second down and 10 go back after a scoreless first period review the scoring for Ian Johnson kicked that 49 yard field goal 3 nothing Auburn the James Jackson took it in for three Georgia had the lead but whoa with that 77 yard run ten seven and then weygand on a beautifully conceived and executed play made at 17 7 at halftime 3rd period probably picked the 50 yard field goal 1710 and Jackson aimed at Auburn's last drive with a touchdown scamper so it's 20 for 10 as James Jackson takes the ball to the 44 yard line it'll be third down 6 pretty important play coming up here Jackson in these situations in the past has liked the sprint out pass to the sideline kept by his wide receiver third down and a long six 45 Jackson looking for the first down and came very close to getting it close enough bitumen makes the tackle a little bit of improvisation and he gets to the 38 yard line and it will be either a fourth down ages or a first down love to wait see he appears to be shot and he is happier so the Bulldogs will have it and forth it itches this is what you'd love to have mo Jackson in your back field or Herschel Walker yeah a red rage Frank secrets pretty good scramble Oh course this is the home of a another former scrambling quarterback once Paducah college Clark Sir Francis Francis fourth down and a yard or less to Worley the 37yard and inches go to the pitch instead of the pure power play because it gives him a chance to either cut back or stay wide first intent Bulldog to the tiger 37 laying in motion the fake pitch the Worland Jackson going P good defensive play by Jimmy Warren intended for Stanley Blaylock running to the corner Jimmy Warren breaking it up almost intercepted by Warren so on first and ten they go for it from the 37 yard line second and ten at the 37yard line soli one takes it to the 36 main Hill makes the tackle third down and ten coming up and we welcome those of you watching Penn State Notre Dame Georgia with a football third and ten at the offer in 37 driveline Georgia trailing by 14 as James Jackson goes back to pass throws and Isaac picked off at the 23 yard line by Kevin Porter something a Georgia Drive receiver burned leading 24 10th the Tigers get the ball back at their own 23 yard line Brett Lane the wide receiver who has been effective also on reverses his time to run a sideline and watch the work a Kevin quarter number three it's in perfect position gets the feet inbounds interception for the Tigers and that's his fourth of the season scoring summary a scoreless first quarter second period down to the 49 yard field goal three nothing offer and James Jackson gave Georgia the lead on the three yard run second period then bo Jackson on the 67 yard touchdown run 10 7 Auburn pretty way gained on an eightyard reverse at halftime Auburn ledge 17 7 then in the 3rd period a long field goal by crumbly a 50yarder made in 1710 but Albarn ended a long drive with Bo Jackson taking an in from 6 his second score of the day bo Jackson by the way has carried the ball 18 times for 116 yards and 2 touchdowns and he's played part time because Fullwood is the other tailback and it's goal wood in the game right now from the 24yard line this is full would carry and he takes you down to the 28 yard line for a gain of five second down and five the man who intercepted the pass Kevin Porter is fourth of the season sophomore and ironically a Georgian there are a lot of Georgians who claim for Auburn ironically just one Alabama player on the Georgia roster call it the Underground Railroad man and there's an offer in Georgia believe it or not in town about 20 miles from here that underground railroad that was only going one way these days that was George's second turnover on 2nd and 5 Washington pitching back to forward and he has stopped at the 29yard final play coming up for the Georgia defense just to reset the story in the Southeastern Conference Florida leads the conference race but they're ineligible for the Sugar Bowl Alabama now for one and one from the tube in the driver seat is Tennessee see they are 31 and oh if they beat Kentucky and Vanderbilt in the last two games when the bombs go to New Orleans Georgia must win this game and hope for a Tennessee wash were tied to go to the Sugar Bowl that's the way it stacks up at the moment Tennessee controls its own destiny the first diamond so the Bulldogs will be getting the ball back as the clock has now run down to under seven minutes to play pac died in his fifth season man Auburn after fire sticks at East Carolina and Wyoming watching his team trying to go even he was a watch charm guard for playing for the Bulldogs back in the late 50s watched charm meeting anyone under 200 pounds back in those times was considered small Louis Kolbert the putt lane is back deep lane standing in his own 27 yard line good hi and relatively deep pick in fact a very deep tech FairTax fall for fumble and recovered by lane himself at the 40 another beautiful kick by Cobert again a man who has a club foot but Nyota today or all season this one 854 yarder mister breakdown in concentration here by lane as he fumbles the ball let's momentarily that he's going to lose it so the dogs get it back with six ten to play in the game Sanford Stadium Athens Georgia Al Michaels with League roast up and out R at Lake Arbor and leave Georgia twentyfour ten and was six ten to go the Bulldogs a team noted for their running game and not their air game has to go to work in a hurry from the 14 yard line for James Jackson to quarterback Jackson under some pressure lost one 35 yard line team into center running back out there in the area but covered well and it's second down in 10 Jackson now 8 of 16 passing for 117 yards and we talked at the very top of the film you can forget that concept right now because Georgia trailing 24 to 10 has got to start putting it up and the Bulldogs are a team coming into the game only 13 passes per game kick complete intended for Herman Archie off his fingertips and its third down and ten thanks Dooley has not seen a Georgia Bulldog team season since 1979 but they're on the verge of doing that now they launched an Alabama on opening night trail by 14 here News team seeking an 8 come on the schedule on third and 10 Jackson sets up the screen hits Henderson Henderson looking for some room fights his way out to the 20 but he's shy in the first annum by five Holmen makes the stop and fourth down comes up from 540 to go in the game so the Bulldogs probably forced to go for it now trailing by two touchdowns fourth and five from the 20 and Fred Lane before comes in with the play they said Lane Herman our team to the right in motion with Jackson rolling right looking and throwing and at 39 Archie and he has the first now the Georgia stays alive just barely Arthur Johnson nearly picked it off but Archie was able to make the grab to go this is a clutch pass on fourth and five as Jackson Sprint's to his right looks to his wide receiver Archie who is six five and has curled back to the outside Kevin Porter is there but he gets in front of him for the valuable first down to keep the drive going from the 30yard line Jackson throwing over the middle man sign the 45 makes you from the 41 of Auburn 4:47 to go in the game Hockaday who dropped an easy path along the sideline earlier running a deep girl in route from his wide receiver position on the right he works in front of Kevin Porter number three takes the ball and turns back to the outside for more valuable yard before Tom Powell number of nine gets in for the final first and ten from the 41 of Auburn protection on the ground he scrambles to the 30yard line and that's a first down for 39 to go the momentarily stopped with a first down for the record Georgia has all of its left but that bold ladder until the next drive they've got to get in this time first we've got a score quick to get the ball back and score again first and ten dogs from the 30 yard line steps up rose dogs get a big break Tom Powell number 9 the best athlete in the secondary is covering Sadowski number 87 he was working down the middle trying to get in front of the safety man I think it was clearly our first two flags in fact and here's the call so they line it up and they will march it off Joe Hicks the referee a 15yard penalty that moves it to the 15yard line first in 10 15 yardline for 22 to go Auburn and white leading 24 to 10 or both to the right Jackson looking for the sidelines and at least done out of bounds and that stops it with 415 run out by Pak Thomas and Russ character next week as usual Nebraska and Oklahoma and a huge one to brass the second in the country Oklahoma 6 1985 no different from other seasons 3 Eastern Time like Saturday second and 11 from the 16 yard line Jackson looking for the end zone and Archie has it knocked away he was booked on the play the crowd wants interference but Warren was making an effort for the ball so no flag third down Jimmy Warren is covering the wide receiver Herman Archie number 81 they both have a right to the football Jackson is now 11 out of 21 for 162 yards and Dooley watches a third and 11 from a 16 yard line they try the pool gift it on the ground now fourth down coming up and timeout call by Kron Jackson because it's fourth and six and they better make sure they've got the play in sync here with four minutes exactly the play in Athens and Auburn leading by two touchdowns all eleven Auburn defenders as a unit went to the sidelines to consult with the defensive assistants and Pat died to talk about stopping a fourth and six up coming here with exactly four minutes to go in the game meanwhile Penn State stretching its advantage 36 to nothing about nine minutes still remaining in that one so at the end of this one was triggers to end before the game and Happy Valley will send you back to State College for the balance of that pray Penn State has been winning ugly today they put some beauty into their attack fourth and six Georgia from the 12 as Jackson looks for an open man and so the Bulldogs give up the football take their timeouts the two remaining on defense and hope to get it back again you've heard that this is a game of inches well believe it this Osborne is this close to having a touchdown Jimmy Warren is the man who applies the hit that finally dislodges him from the football kind of a crowd in there Stanley Black was in there also so now auburn figuring to keep it on the ground and eat up the clock and this is bo Jackson who's a pretty good man to eat up any quad and clean it as well taking it to the 16 24:10 offer it on top as the clock ticks down again the Penn State Notre Dame team behind us in terms of time and so when this one is over we will send you back to the conclusion of that one second down and five with a chance here for all of you to see bo Jackson perhaps again instead it's easy to pull back carrying on this play stop at the 15yard line it will be third down and six is John Brantley makes the tackle for the Bulldogs if it holds now Auburn would be eaten too they have only a miniscule chance of winding up to the Sugar Bowl but you know that Auburn will be going to some Bowl as far as Georgia is concerned near Sugar Bowl chances will go down the drain the loss here but Georgia for the mark of seven two and one and Georgia Tech yet to play figures to wind up in a bowl third down and six so it's fourth down Georgia did not use a timeout on defense as the clock continues to run down to 22 to 21 and Counting and they will be getting the ball back Lewis Colburn out of his own end zone to kick tinman front trying to block it cranking but he gets it away and a fair catch is called for and made at the 46 yard line by John little Bulldogs have it there in Auburn territory 159 to go 24 to 10 Georgia with a football at the Auburn 46 yard line let's go back to the second quarter here was Bo Jackson with Georgia leading 7 to 3 breaking a tackle slipping another getting into Georgia territory and scampering 67 yards for what turned out to be his first touchdown against Georgia in four years and it was vintage Bo because you saw the speed the power and the brokenfield running ability Wayne Johnson is the new quarterback a freshman as do here he sets up the screen and Johnson if he looks familiar to many of you was the starting quarterback in the opener the game that the televised Labor Day night Jackson took over the Johnson machine could be live action and he would arguably be the better passion just slightly second and 10 from the 46 Johnson on a deep drive taxi and throws complete but only a minimal gain to the 43yard line Jackson again makes the catch try Jackson block down to a minute 39 college football scoreboard will be coming up we'll be going in on everything that's happened thus far third down and seven here in a minute and a half under a lot of pressure throwing and finding the open Archy catch of the day and a first down the Georgia State barely alive Archy coming into the game and caught four passes all season Georgia does not throw back Oh but that's what happens when I play catch first half of the 30 be warned he's had a good second hand second time trying to hit Tron Jackson coming out of the back dome Jimmy Warren who's been very busy in the secondary particularly a dimension here in the second half deflects the football Jimmy last time Bo Jackson was in Athens was as a baseball player that night he went four for four hit three home runs double second and ten from the 30yard line Johnson line one thing Georgia is not going down with a whimper first and goal at the nine they still have their two timeouts left but they have to save those for what they hope will be a next Drive is still down by 14 points from the nine Archie the intended receiver and that pass stone to stop the clock as much as anything else second down second down goal to go Georgia with a ball at the 9 yard line Auburn coming in a 2 point underdog leading 24 to 10 Bo Jackson's had a big day the defense some key players and Georgia forced to play catchup second down so Legault Johnson for the end zone incomplete funny lane and a couple of defenders out in front of him third down pretty lame number for the Clanker back on the right is the intended receiver as Johnson Sprint's out he's covered by Warren and Powell in the secondary it looks momentarily that he might be open the ball is thrown just beyond his draft potentially it was a touchdown third and goal now the freshman Johnson back to throw incomplete and so it's borne down Herman Archie was the intended receiver at that time the defensive line put some pressure on Johnny so Johnson arriving late is now three of nine passing for 37 yards big day for the Tigers and on fourth down now Georgia even though it was an incomplete pass and the clock has stopped must take a timeout to discuss their options again it gives us a moment to look at this SEC race the winner of course to go to the Sugar Bowl Florida isn't eligible so they may win the conference they won today their five and one of the conference but the keto Alabama's for one and one but Tennessee with victories and they'll be favored the next two weeks against Kentucky and against Vanderbilt if they go five and one they are in Auburn would can't bring it to they'd be out Georgia three two and one EP on LSU would be bring one and one but again Tennessee is the only team now control its fool destiny on the way to New Orleans fortunately they won early when Tony Robinson was healthy and they won today over Mississippi by 20 giorgia with one timeout left and forced down coming up so they trying to stay in the game right here otherwise Auburn can obviously 46 seconds to play fourth and goal from the 9 Johnson going tip and incomplete Herrmann arts you got a hand on it and that's all Tigers happy Johnson unhappy with himself because he threw that ball high and inside and he thrown it low and outside it might have been patchable for Archie and a potential touchdown giorgia can stop the clock just once if they so elect an Auburn can run it out Washington has gone all the way a quarterback puts his knee down at the 7 yard line and the Bulldogs at the moment anyway not electing to use their one remaining timeout it's all academic anyway as the Auburn Tigers will go eight into a team that many thought would win the national championship Vince Dooley will watch his team lose for the first time since opening night when Alabama in that wild ending came from behind to beat him Schuler leading the team down the field at the very end after it looked like Georgia on a blocked punt and won the game since that time they have gone seven oh and one with the tie against Vanderbilt and a very happy Bo Jackson will join his mates on the way back to Auburn where they will prepare for their battle in a couple of weeks against Alabama Jackson bothered by a deep thigh bruise so he did not carry the ball as much today as he might normally have but he did a masterful job scored twice caught a couple of passes his first two receptions of the season and after the Georgia timeout Washington pushes me down we can write a finish to this one a very happy fat guy wins at the end by 14 Julie the theme of the conference go Susan died in his fifth year a man who has taken the Auburn program and turned it into one of the best in the country
