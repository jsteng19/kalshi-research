============================================================

I never thought the trophy could feel as special but this one absolutely does I'm only a bitch in the what was it now everybody go one iota we go 2050 now Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya season's greetings and not a moment too soon after an off season that was one endless episode of Law &amp; Order we have some actual football tonight the Patriots truck become the first team in 11 seasons to repeat his Super Bowl champions the Steelers a regal franchise already with six Lombardi's and a prime contender to make it seventh partner happy New Year to the patriot motto this season and tonight certainly moving us against the world and it's just the way they like it around here is that you know Tom Brady really wasn't at his best this preseason was he distracted now probably is he motivated tonight oh yeah one thing we know is when the lights are the brightest is generally when Tom Brady's at as best I expect a big performance Steelers Ben Roethlisberger comes off his best season 11 and 5 got to the playoffs what do you think of that team the questions about the Steelers all on the defensive side gone or legends like Dick LeBeau and Troy Polamalu this is a young fast athletic defense but they are going to be severely tested in this environment tonight opening night game number one from Foxborough Massachusetts lights camera action when we come back the Patriots and the steel celebrating ten years of Sunday Night Football NBC Sports welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League national anthem please welcome Grammy Award nominee and New England's own grace putter you see by the dawn's what's so proudly we at the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight or the ramparts we watched were so gallantly me streaming rockets the bombs bursting in gave proof through the night that our flag was still there oh say does that starspangled Oh so the pregame pageantry is over and we go to the field now and welcome Michele Tafoya Michele both of these teams are without their star running back tonight Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell and New England's LeGarrette what are both serving suspensions for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy in an incident a year ago miss Berg is also without widereceiver martavis bryant who's serving a fourgame suspension for his own violation of the substance abuse policy meanwhile last night New England what they're starting proposed center rod Brian Stewart on injured reserve designated for return for a concussion he suffered a month ago he'll miss at least eight games and also starting right now Brian wound L is inactive tonight so that means three rookies will play on the awesome offensive line tonight David Andrews and Trey Jackson his start and Shaq Mason to see significant time rotating in Bill Belichick told us the offensive line talent is better than last year's whether or not they're ready is the question out all right Thank You Michelle all they have to do is protect the franchise meanwhile there's the part of the Pittsburgh franchise you've got bail and you've got Brown and also Ben Roethlisberger all coming off spectacular seasons Ben's best be part of that draft class back in O four with Eli Manning and Phillip Rivers so Brady's won four Super Bowls and Ben's one two and played in another New England has won the toss and as always they elect to defer that's Bellatrix mo3 Archer is back to receive the kick on opening night in Foxborough light rain right now temperature in the 60s Stephen Dostoevsky now in his tenth season as the Patriots kicker season on with the touchpad Ben Roethlisberger Miami Redhawks the Angela Williams the University of Memphis Antonio Brown century mission Marcus Wheaton Chandler high school Keith Miller Virginia Matt's faith Minnesota Calvin Beecham Southern Methodist University Ramon foster Ripley high school Cody Wallace Texas A&amp;M David de Castro Stanford Marcus Gilbert or Tony Wallace one of the guys in the crosshairs tonight marquis Pouncy who was out for about half the season at least pittsburg front of the 20 on the first scrimmage ploy 2015 and they start with Williams the longtime Carolina Panther and a great debut as a stealer and team yard game to the 38 taking the place of Le'Veon Bell Dante Hightower makes the tackle first down barely very rarely do you see Rob Ning kovitch on the outside not able to keep contained but that time a little bit of the speed and quickness of DeAngelo Williams the difference will give you a little grab a little tug from Matt Spain to help out that ever no flag 18 yard picked up on his first carry as a Pittsburgh speeder that same telling you a brown and motion to the right side and they flip it to him and brown great after the catch picking up yardage you need us so there a gain of nine it'll be second down and 1 Roethlisberger last year tied with Drew Brees for most passing yards in the league and when you do the math on that that's over 300 yards a game great TD to interception ratio 32 to 9 second one up at the 48 Williams and Williams takes it to the 50 Rob Minkoff H Purdue Alan branch University of Michigan Ducklin brow tech challenge owns Syracuse University dama Collins 7 me Jerrod Mayo Tennessee dr. yachts how the university felt from Malcom Butler West Alabama universe Patrick Chung the Ducks Devin McCourty Toro Brown takes and so Butler the Super Bowl hero now in the role of shutdown corner he should be on Brown most of the night if not all been fake Roethlisberger slipped that maintained his balance and it's caught by Heath Miller who takes it to the 35 male makes the tackle Miller now in his 11th season out of Virginia that's a gain of 14 the Pittsburgh Steelers have been running the ball so well now we're seeing this Patriots defense forced to react up to it in the playaction very effective DeAngelo Williams early on showing some will quickness he's lost about 15 pounds from when he got cut with the Carolina Panthers and it shows so calling this one Tom hailey now in his fourth year as the offensive coordinator in law last season seal is establishing a lot of offensive team records and DeAngelo Williams to the 24 he can flame all three now he's 32 years old we asked Tomlin last night can this guy really play all three downs he said at least for two weeks at the young Malcolm Brown right here and so far he has been struggling inside that time was David de Castro just sort of threw him away to the outside these are gaping holes that you typically do not see against the Patriots defense Williams three carries smack receivers to the right now he's lefthanded looking but the defense does its job and he gets taken down at the 31 yard line by Malcolm Brown number one draft choice out of Texas it helped that they were in a zone defense that time so the safeties back here deep able to kind of see this one from afar no doubt about that Antonio Brown who was a lefthanded quarterback in high school say idolizes bike Vick and white omelets that every time he looks at bacon kind of dosing wide eyed but Patriots defense not wide blossom 8 second down and Williams he gets bounced back but bounces off he would be tackling its thrust that obeys me of a first flag of the season Dante Hightower in on the tackle Karl Jeffries is the referee we'll hear from him number 77 offense Marcus Gilbert well he got away they held him the first time but Ning kovitch this time was going to get grabbed and very tail into this thing just as the Angela Williams was jumping to the outside you saw a Gilbert just grab the Jersey and dicot so what looked like a very promising Drive you try the gimmick play that goes nowhere but that works and now the thing fight your way back in the field goal and another second in 28th the backup running back is will Johnson fullback by trade that's Johnson behind blockers gonna give it to him Shelvin used as a wall carrier but freshman to backup duty tonight with bailout Williams getting the start tackle made there after a gain of about six and it will be third and very long and easily is down that's Dominique easily the injured New England Patriot the Patriots during the offseason pretty busy the Boston Pops going to Bruins games tiring that trophy around everywhere they went concert and nearest places lead who ended last season on injured reserve and we'll take a look at what happened to him as he was fighting there with Cody of Wallace you saw him grab his left hip and here's a young man has been through a lot of injuries injuries to both knees in college and finally healthy they were excited about he gives them a bit of an athletic pass rusher inside some of the other guys more run Stoppers and so that will hurt easily a player resumes with a third down and 22 from the New England 36 yard line Bill Belichick in his 16th season as the head coach here spent five years in the lanes 41 years total as a head coach or assistant coach in the NFL checkers going over something with Mike Tomlin still the secondyoungest coaching league Mike McCoy of San Diego's at least get in feel something do get a little closer Williamson's in the block and he finds me here and never does get open enough to pick up enough yardage to put them in field goal range to the 26 yard line Chung and Butler are there the Steelers now with a new kicker they were able to pick up Josh Scobee in a late trade a couple of weeks ago from Jacksonville because Sean squeezin their top kicker got hurt in the Hall of Fame game in Canton Ohio in August and then they brought Garrett Hartley in and he got hurt so they picked up Scobie with a lot of experience and his first effort as he steal there will be a 44 yard attempt no wind to speak of and snow bees first kick is no good lied to the right to a promising drive gets bogged down on a trip play in the penalty and then the field goal attempt no good here comes ray speaking of Sunday night football three nights we will be in Texas for the Dallas Cowboys against the New York Giants on Sunday Night Football here we go Tom Brady taking his first snap of the season Hey in the empty backfield fix to the lake quickly brought by Edelman and Julian Edelman their number one receiver gets forced out of bounds by William gay flag on the play coming in late personal personal foul number 77 offense 15 yard panel the down counts second down that's Nate's soldier who got into it with Jarvis Jones right at the very tail end of the play it's Jones up underneath him then you take the swing and there it is sort of all's fair until you get to that point and as soon as somebody reacts obviously the fist under the chin unsettling for Nate's older he reacts and he gets it Tom Brady winning four Super Bowls MVP and three of them and he joins Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana as the only fourtime winners overall he and Bella Trek have been to six every one of the newsmen catch the closures of course was last February in Glendale Arizona first and 25 from the figgety the fastest part on the outside and that is on newest it was first in twelve he's that actually the penalty was marched off from the end of the place to his first and twelfth Dion Lewis makes the catch and that will give them the first down up at the 44 giving a lot of space on the outside as Tom Brady goes right to the no hado a cautious start here for the Steelers defensively Brady protection that's it to the outside Louis again playing in his first game in two years came up with Philadelphia got Bert was with Cleveland got Perth there was with Indianapolis briefly and he may play a very big role tonight Dion Lewis Tom Brady said this guy is about to become a cult hero here in New England with his quickness people are kind of loved watching him play and there's a brief taste of that like I knew that David would hit him he was here when the Pittsburgh 43 yard line with he going up your stairs it just now come going and get a little closer to these receivers when he swings that one incomplete intended for Rob Gronkowski Tom Brady Michigan Dion Lewis Pitt Julian Edelman Kent State Danny Amendola Texas Tech Rob Gronkowski Arizona Scott Chandler Iowa Nate solder Colorado Josh spawn Kent State David Andrews Georgia Trey Jackson float estate Sebastien Ballmer University of Houston two rookies at center and right guard one receiver missing is Brandon LaFell he's hurt undefeated list and brainy going B then a little too deep intended for Danny Amendola down the right sideline he'd beaten gay down the sideline before the safety help could get over there and it will be third down in ten oldest play in the park against man courage Julian Edelman is going to come down here just a little pick rub whatever you want to call it doesn't get called and they just miss a big home run ball there really no excuse Tom Brady just missed them Patriots they can beat you by running as 50 times we're throwing it 50 times against Pittsburgh historically they've been very passive and they start that way tonight no Russian so far five passes then great play clock at one town has to escape but not very far I can only get to the 43 that's but improves their number one draft choice number 48 making the tackle so you'd be looking at a real long distance field goal obviously here and then pass up that opportunity over 16 Ryan Allen comes in to punt had a screen pass coming this way if I Dupree unblocked on the play and for some reason Tom Brady's didn't like the screen pass late getting the ball and just got unsettled Brian Allen Belichick has always loved left footed punters and Alan over the years Brown is back across with fair cats and collects it at the 7yard line that's where Pittsburgh will begin the second drive off halfway through the opening quarter on open a night no score bill belichick on his iPad Super Bowl starters after the old one season they lost they lost four after their o three when they lost two starters after their old for victory and then six starters are gone on offense Connolly in Vereen four on defense including the starting corners browner and Revis and the third corner would have been Arrington who's now with Baltimore so Bill Belichick not afraid to mix up the roster nice come guys go he shocks people there is Malcolm Butler he of the immaculate interception in the super ball and now their key guy Pittsburgh from the seven yard line Williams and loins up to the 12 yard line Angela Williams 9 really good seasons with Caroline had a tremendous college career at Memphis he rushed for over 6,000 yards and four seasons there and they knew that they were in trouble in terms of lady on bail and is going to get suspended originally for three games now just for two they bring a minute thirty twoyearsold second active running back oldest actor only Fred Jackson his older second down and four take him down by the shoelaces by Chandler Jones number 95 then we third down no question one of the best players on this football team for New England right here Chandler Jones had some injury problems last year just six sacks but by the time it got to the playoffs he took off he and Rob Ning kovitch I thought were brilliant throughout the playoffs is Matt Patricia the defensive coordinator good young talent Dante hi on these things third and five showing blitz here they come and then throw is planned from Butler so Butler may have taken care of regard to locket but Brown says not me baby not me that is as perfect to coverage as you can have and watch what Antonio Brown the leading receiver in the National Football League does catches it right off his hand that is unbelievable he had no chance at that ball he's almost like what Malcolm Butler did in the supermoon Wow from the 22 yard line under the sea why couldn't it have been us Cole from Jeffers coming illegal formation offense number 68 was not on the line of scrimmage fiveyard penalty replay first down Kelvin Beechum the left tackles the back and look at that catch by Brown again phenomenal this was one arm and grabbed he had the ball and one arm and Malcolm Butler's helmet and the other he was trying to get his left arm down the ball got stuck on his arm at me still Cottle back in the 17th 1st and 15 this burger throws Brown there and to the 20 yard line for the 129 passes last season let's go to Michelle Al patriots defensive tackle Dominique easily has gone to the locker room he's questionable with a hip the medical staff was looking at his left side I'll tell you when he walked back to the locker room he walked slowly and very gingerly so he has remains there now we'll keep you posted I thank you for shell second down and 12 if the Steeler coaches headsets are okay right now we were told couple of minutes ago that they were getting the Patriot radio broadcast in their headsets maybe 12 Roethlisberger tough to bring down at this time he's brought to the turf by Dante Hightower the toughest guys in the league his saggy got guys hanging all over him throughout his career but Hightower had him and his grasp took him to the turf these two inside linebackers find a way to get to the quarterback I thought it was one of the differences in the end of the season last year both he and Jamie Collins and if you're wondering there is no horse collar in the pocket so even though Hightower here is going to grab them around the back that is not a penalty sakurachan 18 and then biased on but he may be a little short of the first down Heath Miller needs 18 gets 17 as they'll spot the ball just short of the 31 yard line Devin McCourty covering on the play and they bring in the punting group where as a defense you want to play that line but that's cutting it awfully close nice job by Devin McCourty coming out of center field and making that solid tackle McCord he made a bunch of solid tackles in the Super Bowl when Marshawn Lynch broke out a few times Jordan Perry on the job from Brad wing and tranny can't win now with the Giants here's a Minghella who collected a can flag is thrown there and Bella brings it back out to the 34 the flag is there Matthew Slater involved in the play Pittsburgh indicating it's against New England will get the call from Jeffers during the return illegal block in the back number 18 of the return team 10 yard penalty first down the weeks later opening night no store in Foxborough max coming to NBC a mind erase the body of clues that lead Paul's most really mystery blindspot premiering Monday September 21st on NBC Town Boston about a 40minute drive away but not in rush hour from the 10yard line I used to be a Lewis mr. pepper we started talking about we were told that they were having trouble the Patriot or the Steeler coaches in their headsets they were getting the Patriot radio broadcast that you don't think do you opponents would not call that trouble they would call that whatever there is every team that I know of has some story about what happens to them in this stadium and of course deflategate was all part of that and that's not going to help the fact that they're getting those radio signals in their headset to be on Lois of course there were a spate of stories this week longform pieces by ESPN and Sports Illustrated talking about pervasive and persistent cheating but the Patriots have extensively done since 2001 the one thing that Belichick has told us team and hey forget it boys we don't listen to the outside noise but there's a lot of outside know there's a lot outside noise and it's going to be enhanced after this start here I mean the Grady tries to sneak as he does very often Patriots at a very stern response to those reports this week but it's been an ongoing saga in New England enough for a first down Brady able to pick up the inches needed with a minute 40 to go another this is what Brady does very often on third maybe fourth and short now Brady's knee did go down but it's like they felt like it crossed that line but I tell you it is unsettling for a visiting team to come in here and have something like that happen you want to say okay we're starting the game now we're on an equal playing field but I guarantee of Mike Tomlin is hot right now from the 20yard line to the outside flag is long I mean Lisa should be listening to our broadcast mean the patient's radio guys are good but he was pretty good on Lewis's holding side number 77 offense 10yard penalty repeat first out and sold her second penalty of the quarter you know it happened so many times to those tackles that especially when they're not anticipating that the back is necessarily going to bounce outside on them they're blocking blocking and then all of a sudden the back jumps and the defensive player makes a move in the tendency to just grab and then you're outside the phone work and here comes a flat it's Brandon Bolden sets up wide to the right running back by tree all the way and that's plot sitting down at the 19yard line is Aaron Thompson the six week 200 pounder from Marshall tackle deer by William gay well probably the best pass rusher for the Steelers this preseason right there James Harrison just say that how about that he is the guy and Mike Tomlin Sam you know he really doesn't like being the leader he likes being the villain but can't help himself all these guys just ball him around like he's the Pied Piper they all show up at the cold tub at 6:45 because he does second and 11 pumpkin pie there's the sideline bug wrestle down by Cortez now Linda will be third and short on the first play of the second quarter B's we've played one on opening night Pittsburgh nothing New England nothing special continues effort these messages Gillette Stadium Foxborough Massachusetts Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya the seasonopener no score start the second quarter New England with a third and two at its own 28 yard line what a tease Thanks it went in motion picked up the first down julian edelman up to the 37 yard line let's go to Michelle that communications issue down here on the Pittsburgh side it was with the coach to coach head sets the word is that they were getting some sort of Patriots radio broadcast bleed into those headsets while that was going on the Patriots coach coach headsets were shut off so that things were a level for the moment but right now I'm told that everyone's headsets are up and working well again for the time being that's according to the NFL y'all stay tuned Brandon Bolden gets taken down behind the line of scrimmage one of the most exciting young players in the league right here watch them shoot this gap in here Ryan shazier I don't know that I've seen a faster linebacker coming out of college just has the ability to make big plays wasn't healthy a season ago but they say he has made huge strides this year and guys like Ryan shazier and Jarvis Jones are going to have to take big steps if this defense is gonna play well linebackers up to the 40yard line beyond Lewis came Heyward vo I'll stay Steve McClendon tear order that fought well today aren't there moats James Madison Ryan says 'view Boston University Lawrence Timmons Florida State target zones to it William duty low Mike Mitchell Ohio University Will Allen the Ohio State head so on Blake elusive sixes the question in Pittsburgh the defensive in particular that secondary can they hold up third and six and that's Clark for another first time that's element again that Pittsburgh be in there under the tutelage of one Keith but lay the new defensive coordinator going against the new quarterback Antwon Blake they call him Zilla Kazee they say just mean he's a mean tough guy and he has his hands full inside we saw in the Super Bowl as well in the playoffs last year very difficult to handle Julian Edelman at the line of scrimmage but a lot of changes in this secondary including bringing Bill Allen the veteran to come in and try and help him with communication Louis thanks for the outside taken down there for a short game so Dick LeBeau they did not renew his deal he moved on to Tennessee working there with Ken Whisenhunt Keith Butler offensive coordinator was the linebackers coach for 12 years so he was actually there before Tomlin came in milk our hired him and he stayed on and now he's the DC one time linebacker during Seattle second grade ethos and finds Edelman again the 35yard line tackle there by Blake and Alan trying to take advantage of this young offensive line up front gonna come with the old Pittsburgh Steelers cross blitz here but that was a nice job by Dion Lewis coming across and picking it up not a big guy but they say you stout and he will block and then you don't get there with more covering Julian Edelman already four catches Gronkowski sooner or later Gronkowski was going to catch one and there's his first of the season of the 16 yard line very difficult to cover the seams against Gronkowski and there's a big hole and Tom Brady got that one off just in time touchdown they came up to the line that run the play right pouchy the back touches lay in the yards 13 plays to the first score of the season and they've got issues with communication on the back end Robert golden is in the game and he typically is the special teams captain plays very little but he's going to come out of the side here and see that Gronkowski is completely uncovered they were worried about communication on the back end for Pittsburgh and now it is come to fruition that was poorly done the last two or three plays with that hurry up offense gave them problems you the extra coin a snap from the 15 three yard field goal and no issue here on the first official new extra point in the National Football League of seven to nothing all right our plane is up downtown Boston on his head 63 degree night and by 95 and head back to cover tonight's aerial coverage being brought to you by Stadium it opened in 2002 it open 13 years ago yesterday against the Pittsburgh Steelers and it's a night when they celebrated their first Super Bowl title now seasons that kick into the night and then starts the night sixfour sixfour 63 yards takes over the 20 when we come back secondary coach Carnell lake a pretty good player in his time he's the defensive back coach in his team this unit had a little problem here Chris yeah right back here in the back end nobody sees Gronkowski and now all of a sudden Brady sees that nobody sees Gronkowski but this is a team they're keeping this he's saying come on come on come on let's go snap but I got Gronkowski wide open and that's a walkin at the perfect matchup Williams running back diangelo stop sharp good start for the Steeler offense tonight but then a penalty they try to trick play with brown throwing and since then the Patriots have pretty much stuffed them yeah but what has been working has been DeAngelo Williams and what always works is Rob Gronkowski and one of those guys you definitely want to invite to your party I'm safe up on stage singing and dancing and heard all kinds of thing the guy that loves life doesn't it it's around 2nd and 8th from the 22 those two hi for Keith Miller third down take a look at been Jewish career number one pick back in oh four there his numbers right there that's his first eight years first eight seasons and then with Todd Haley coming in as the offensive coordinator took a little while for them to get in rhythm but he's been pretty terrific especially last season they are missing some bigtime weapons tonight maybe the passing game as much as the running game who turned out to be fun for me before touchdowns not here and the center marquise bouncy meanwhile walk this burgers going to go feet feel and it will be so on a third down in a hayward Bay at one point figured to be a superstar with Oakland he was a seventh guy picked in the online draft really hasn't done much through his career not getting another chance here a 48yard game just three catches last year but he can fly a 43 guy in a course drafted by the Rangers in that situation and on the other side Pratt like Fletcher a guy who got beat like that more than a few times last year in Philadelphia from the 35 yard get outside to pick up five yards before he's pushed away less than ten minutes to go in the Hampton New England on top seven I think in Pittsburgh driving mr. Paul sheared on the outside number 93 a guy that they are extremely excited to have but that is not the first time tonight that we have seen the speed of DeAngelo Williams hit outside this defense and boy you go to a patriot practice and all you hear from Belichick has set the edge set the edge so far in this game they've been getting beat on the edge Williams seven carries for 46 yards number eight is a two yard at government setting up a third down and two at the 28 yard line ten seasons in the league for Williams nine years in the league for a Mike Tomlin and everybody talking about when he got hired he won the Super Bowl in the second year the owner in the league was saying finding the next Mike Tomlin 8 1 it was the problem a lot of young coaches got hired none of them turned out to be anything close well in almost a halfcentury you've had truck Gold Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin that's it at the helm of the Steelers third and three down to zero Roethlisberger that's incomplete Antonio Brown looks for a flag doesn't get it covered by Butler and in comes the field goal unit hey this Malcolm Butler is making an impression he's been all over the leading receiver in the National Football League now obviously Ben was thinking back shoulder throw there didn't happen the Malcolm Butler that's a long way from being a sub in the Super Bowl and then all of a sudden now you're covering the number one guy who's the new girl Remus I guess 46yard attempt Scobie already missed important to speak of and that one is good we picked up from Jack's building a very auspicious killer beginning seven of the oil eight and a half to go and a half seven to nothing new england after a missed Scobie field goal his second he got the young guys on the front tonight drafted pair of rookies and Shaq Mason and Trey Jackson that's coming in the fourth run that puts him under fire on opening night who and well so far in the 36 yard line rady off the play fake fires over the night edelman big night for julian edelman already five catches for first down so far tonight Tom Brady's getting the protection from that interior three of this offensive line if you're going to beat Tom Brady typically you have to get him to move laterally the Steelers would have loved tonight to make Brady step to the side but that anterior three their young that they're getting the job done luis people know where he is stuffed by Jarvis Jones at the line of scrimmage it'll be second down in ten they need a whole bunch of that out of Jarvis Jones this year they have been very open and honest Keith Butler the defensive coordinator basically saying it's time you know you're a guy he led the nation in sacks and we just haven't seen that look at the shot he put on Nate solder there and came in took care of Dion Lewis as well if he starts playing like that and shazier pers the way that he can was young defense good fast Brady before pressure gets their swings it caught Danny over his shoulder making the ground stays inbounds first down you play man coverage you're going to get a pick set right there and then you're gonna get the swing route they ham and dole up the sideline they missed the first one they don't miss that one it is a difficult proposition one of the things that's happening in this game tonight is that William Gay is being asked to play inside because they wanted this club of veteran communication between Will Allen William Gay and Timmons but you just have to wonder now is everybody a bit unsettled with their position that was a gain of 18 that is the big question coming in from Pittsburgh Grady gets out of trouble and that'll be another first down in the 30 20 yard line is Brandon Bolden comes out of the backfield to make the catch brothers you know we were talking about at the beginning Chris the fact that the defense in Pittsburgh that's the big question you know they're gonna score very potent offense especially when you know Bell gets back and Bryant obviously but that secondary was the key yeah and what you do not want to see are the mental breakdowns mike tomlin chief Butler intentionally made this defense very simple for this game as it was going to be loud the road and so far we've seen those breakdowns balance on this drive is beyond Lewis picks up 8 yards well the other part of this defensively that you have to see out of the Pittsburgh Steelers is step on to it and Cameron Heyward they have to take care of the middle in there Louis tries to back you swing girl horse down spotted I think just a little bit short of the 10 yard line well if this young offensive line can play and play well think about what the future could be here they've had the two tackles Sebastian Vollmer and Nate's older play for a long time here and now you've got David Andrews and Brian stork coming off the concussion Trey Jackson drafted and Shaq Mason a very athletic guy on that left side along with Josh Klein we're thinking that's a young Bunch could be here for 10 years raucous cannon in the right tackle third a short one already sneaks again that's gonna set up a first down and goals we took down to five minutes left in the half tell you what Brady's going to take a little shot on this when coming in from his right side but he has away shazier timed it up perfectly they doubleteam can a champ but it wasn't until a week ago that you even knew for sure the time was going to play tonight at the 5yard line therefore gain of about for these gentlemen William gay there to make the sub alright here we go it's tough enough to play against these guys when you've got 11 out there you show up with 10 and we have seen all kinds of trouble I don't know what happened exactly Mike Mitchell was coming in and out of the game for a little while and so I'm not sure if he got hurt but the throat then seems a little out of sync now defensively second Lord Boldin is the running back that's down Gronkowski the second boy they made that look pretty z9 play 64 yards for us five passes and brought to the end zone twice today right there Wow and they put him in because of his veteran leadership and communication they gave him a run formation and then just went right by Will Allen don't know how you stopped that big guy I asked Bill Belichick do you think you'll see cover two which basically means the middle of the field open he said nobody plays cover two against us as they can't cover Gronkowski at the 23yard line this task is good for all Patriots to make it work can you take a look at the solution for that's pretty good tip Jason day Ricky Fowler who won here last week Watson is in there Charlie Hoffman played well down the road coming up beginning Thursday off channel skinny right there to the 17 yard line the Pittsburgh Steelers haha trying to get out of it 357 to go in the open Rob Gronkowski came here in 2010 and since then in terms of proficiency well red zone since Brock got here 42 touchdowns three interceptions that's a 55th overall touchdown pass that Brady has thrown to Gronkowski until 94 in the zone both New England touchdowns now the Steelers from the 17 yard line around the tip by Butler spins away for another cup of the orange takes it up to the 22 yard line this is going to look familiar to a lot of people this was the old Super Bowl play come out with a pick now it's gonna come and Butler's gonna drive on it he just played it a little deeper but he did get a big shot that time on Antoniou Brown a little more effective pick that time Marcus Wheaton second and five we're gonna have left in the half draw Williams up to the 31:8 flag however is sown at the 20yard line holding number 72 off that's the center taking bouncies place Cody Wallace interior guys just aren't used to being in space and that time it was Cody Wallace who got out he's gonna make a good block but he just again is Angela Williams got to the outside you just grab the outside of it and you saw Jamie Collins begging for the flag and John at that time not a big hole by any means by Cody Wallace on that one at her second and 15 from the 12 those his way to the 21 had a chance to talk to Malcolm Butler about that Super Bowl play and he said when I saw him plant that outside foot like that I knew he was going inside I drove hard on that thing and just made the play he said one of the things that was really key for me was seeing that foot move and then the reaction time you're going to see come back in but he said I was so angry that that tipped ball I was covering landed in the lap of the receiver I thought I was to go to the games I had nothing to lose at that point I just fired my shot ended up working out when he came out on the next play went back in for you know why pass caught by Antone and he is out of bounds at the new england 41 yard line so a big third down conversion Butler again covering on the play and we posted the twominute warning 37 yard gain Antonio Browns not too bad either that time you don't get a good solid jam on him and that's an issue running that go route from the slot position is so much easier let's see if they come back to it five grams for him twominute warning 14 nothing with these stealers on the move so the halftime coming up they and Tony and Rodney are all here weighing in in the first half we'll take a look ahead to Sunday Night Football Giants cowboys but f time two minutes Pittsburgh has all of its time like that double trouble and Jonathan Stewart at Carolina four years at the 40yard line brought this burger leading up to the line will huddle mid40s five in the Hat stare has been waving the ball all night they just have to start the burden points atchoo 22 OH wrestle him down about three yards short of the first down in bounds so it'll be third down time considering those three time asking we'll need to take one here at stirred that in three and Josh go beyond we shot within and Ben's gonna throw tended to market Terrell brown longtime 49er came over this year and it's fourth down well and because you know what Bella Jack's gonna do he's gonna try and take away your top threatened at San Antonio Brown so they knew Marcus Wheaton and they knew Darius Hayward Bay had to make some place tough play here but it could have been a real game changer they just have not been able to do it now they're gonna go for it you're on board yeah Scotty would have to pick a 53 yarder Waqas Berger has whistle before the snap timeout have been called coagulating a 30second timeout fourth down when we come back first player to miss two field goals for the Steelers since 1970 first player since seven Watson discovery stays on the sidelines here's raucous burger after the New England timeout the 35yard line each first down here Darius named invade and they'll take a timeout with Pittsburgh because had they not prayed he would have had enough time to march down the field again back after the timeout first down 31 yard line Steelers have two timeouts and if the Royals smooth to cut it the inside to the 25yard line Pittsburgh letting the clock one here now you're to the point where really getting into Nerdist I'm not using a timeout here that's a lot of time off the clock second and five no it's not it's the official comes over to see your on the choc means I'm not taking that time out leaves them alone 13 seconds how could they mess this up there it is his right foot is on the chalk even when they get a layup this is a layup there's nobody there well I understood not taking the time out earlier but here now they're down to 13 they're gonna leave a timeout maybe two on the board in the meantime they'll take one here Wow the clock stopped well the clock stopped Pittsburgh had to take a timeout just to figure out what they get gonna do here it's third down and five at the 25yard line they have one timeout and I want to settle for a Scobie field goal Ben Roethlisberger that last one really moved the safety see if he comes back and now you're going to get another New England timeout yeah and that enables us to tell you this info kit go special brought to you by Verizon watch live prime time games benefi mobile only on four eysan by chevrolet finding roads by Everest the most intense IMAX daily experience September the 18th and by nationwide one is on your side snow here of course over the winter they came back in it when they had 110 inches in fact thousands of fans Boylston Street to celebrate the Patriots fourth Super Bowl win 96 degrees here two days ago the snow finally melted third and five from the 26 under pressure cause and that's incomplete they looks for a flag and doesn't get it and his 4000 so from the moment they're gonna get Scobie coming out to attempt a field goal of about 44 yards there is a word BAE doesn't play a lot but anytime you're planning gets mantoman coverage you don't stop you've got to make sharp breaks you've got to try and separate and you're brown on the outside another good job by Malcolm Butler that's been a 44 yard at 10 times an ugly ng would seem to be a wreck promise to drive they have a new holder as well in addition Scobie the punter is the new holder and that kick is good so with three seconds remaining in the half it's now 14 to 3 well one person not in attendance tonight is the Commissioner Roger Goodell Oh opted not to come watching on television to sort of understand it I mean you know he can argue both sides of it I'll tell you one thing if judge Berman showed up they would parade him around the stadium in a sedan chair we've seen signs around town free coffee for life for judge Marvin I read one article that said the only chance the Steelers had was given up when judge Berman made that ruling I tell you they've hung in there pretty good against this Patriots team even despite all they're missing on the offensive side so Tom Brady not that he needed any extra incentive or juice or whatever didn't remember he can say all he's man he pretty much approaches every key the same way yeah when he came out on the field though about an hour before the game for his very first appearance in front of this crowd they went crazy as you might expect and he gave it some pretty good fist pumps like he had just thrown a couple of touchdown passes knew that in the first half and the Super Bowl champions on opening night he drives culminating with Gronkowski touchdowns lead 14 to 3 coming up next time after these messages from miracle Tom Brady nearly 15 of 17 in the first half two of those completions touchdowns to Gronkowski the Pats 14 3 at the half here's Dan Tony and Rodman alright Bob thank you Rodney you spent time with Rob Gronkowski last week and he knew he's gonna be the focal point of this Steeler defense he made it look too easy I was too easy Dan and all week distillers talked about Jim and I being physical at the line of scrimmage slowing him down and if they didn't do any of that coach and with all the changes in the secondary I know about miscommunication but this is just lack of execution you cannot let the best tighten on the planet go up the seen my Tomlin was worried about the young guys making mistakes here's a big one no one covers Rob Gronkowski easy touchdown so now all of a sudden they decide to put two guys on it and guess what they still can't cover and get our hands on and we're gonna rough him up he runs right up the save you cannot let this guy score is too tough sounds that's inexplicable when the two touchdown drives Brady 12 for 12 a hundred and 34 yards Fitchburg had opportunities here they did and there's so much pressure on their offense they can't make mistakes but they're looking for the big play and sometimes it's not there this is a double pass a trick play but you see the safeties deep and Tonio Browns just got to throw this away he can't take the loss and then Rodney this you can't have these kind of mistakes where receivership gets the ball but he just steps out of bounds but offensively they were moving the ball they're having success then all of a sudden they try a double pass coach they get a flag out the words don't get too cute don't outsmart yourself penalties two missed field goals they should be in this game well the Steelers have more total yards than the Patriots do but they're down 14 to 3 coming up look ahead to the Giants Cowboys Sunday Night Football opener featuring Odell Beckham jr. but first while everyone knows that sports are exciting let's take a look at some of the folks who take that excitement and go the distance at halftime the Patriots lead the Steelers 14 to 3 meanwhile looking ahead our first Sunday Night Football game features the Giants of the Cowboys and the last time these two teams met on a Sunday night last November the Giants Odell Beckham jr. made a play you might remember even if you still don't believe it was sunday night football against the Cowboys its first from 10 on the 43 yard line who does have a long playaction is a double move out and up I go to jump for the ball I see that you know I like it uses the one on that I had was just the right arm and it was the only way that I was gonna be able to get a hand on the ball so I just reached back and little did I know my life is gonna change forever after that play you are going to see that may be the greatest catch I've ever seen unbelievable as a word that's often overused in sports but that was pretty close to unbelievable Beckham and the Giants will be in Dallas on Sunday night
