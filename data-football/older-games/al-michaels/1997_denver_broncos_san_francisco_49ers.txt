============================================================

San Francisco on a sparkling December evening pool about 50 degrees and freakin Park sold out tonight jammed to the rafters for the 49ers in the Denver Broncos and much much more few months ago Jerry Rice who returns to the 49er lineup tonight after 15 weeks Pollack major knee surgery was introduced to this hottie she has returned to the lineup tonight with head coach Steve Mariucci another chapter in Jerry Rice's storied career we know he's going to play but what's the criteria for how long he will play well he's going to play on occasion throughout the game and I want to get him in the game here on the first drive a little bit but it'll all depend on how his leg is feeling if he's feeling good well then we'll play him probably a little bit more but if he's if he feels anything at all then we'll pull back and everybody just wants to him play and walk off healthy you've got coach thank you okay all right Thank You Lynn so we have Elway against John we have a team seeking to get homefield advantage throughout the playoffs Jerry Rice back Montana's number retired at the half Terrell Davis apart from that not much happening here tonight here we go from San Francisco a beauty as Jason Elam kicks off taken at the three by Chuck Levy who's the fastest of the 49ers Arizona Cardinal brings it back to the 34yard line Steve Young again a great year seeking his fifth passing title leads the league in pass trading 18 touchdowns this season only six interceptions terry kirby out of the back field because garrison Hearst is hurt William Floyd the fullback Stokes and Owens the wide outs and the retiring Brent Jones the tie then dese proud Dorman Gogan and Stratford it's a mixandmatch offensive line that's gotten better week after week and the first pass is blocked Floyd the fullback he'll run a lot about ten times tonight and they'll throw at him a lot but he drops this one defensively a 43 for Denver Neal Smith on his way to the Pro Bowl trailer Tana Vasa comes back from an injury and Alfred Williams Mobley having a great year Aldridge and Romanowski the linebackers bill an ex 49er Crockett and Gordon at the corners at order and Braxton the safeties Gordon's had a fine year until last week when he was burned for three touchdown passes second down and ten and young Floyd makes the catch and Floyd fights his way to the 38 now it's third and five and Jerry Rice is coming into the game here he is as the third wide receiver we're going to do tonight according to Steve Mariucci is when rice is in the game they're going to do a lot of motion they want Gerry on the move they know that Denver doesn't know quite what to expect whether he'll play from the slot or split out wide this defies all that we used to think about rehabilitation from a knee surgery slot right and emotion goes right by Kirby breaks a tackle first down at a lot more and down the sidelines he goes we forced out of at the 25yard line dan said they're going to motion in a LOF they bring him in motion and bring him to the left side and then driving across the field the other direction and they scream that way Frank that might have been the most highly publicized decoy in the history of football is rice underneath the screen to the outside Ray Brown out in front of it with the block looking for somebody to crush and there is where Kirby steps out and they mark it at the 26 terrific all that conventionally now first down at the 26 yard line out of the I formation Boyd the fullback Kirby the tailback Kirby come what Steve Mariucci referred to as one a this season as brown gets into it for the moment with loutish garrison Hearst had assumed the lead role he was the featured back but with first heard and they hope to have him back for the playoffs Kirby has to play not in every down situation but a lot more well garrison Hearst was a guy that they really counted on to bang it in there he's got a thousand and 19 yards and the 49ers are are hopeful of his broken collarbone will allow him to come back five weeks after the injury that would be for their first playoff game after the bye week could well happen it wasn't displaced and they feel confident he will be back second and ten Owens down Kirby cuts it back takes it to the 18 yard line short of the first down tackled by Crockett it's third down short to long one in that neighborhood with garrison Hearst out of the lineup the 49ers will they admit they're going to have to open up their office a little more Hearst with the thousand yards rushing and this is Kirby former Miami Dolphin he's a rookie at 75 reception good receiver that the 49ers feel they have to open up their offense a little more they have to get Steve Young into rise back into the lineup and spit out to the right rice oneonone third and short young that's the other way a lot of traffic and they tried to jam it into Brent Jones who has announced his retirement at the end of this season Allen Aldridge breaks it up so it's 4th down and 2 and Gary Anderson who's approaching Knick Lowery's career field goal mark will try to come one closer well it's so much emotion in Brent Jones one of the great 49ers over 400 receptions a terrific guy and this will be his last regular season game played here at San Francisco Anderson 32 field goals on Monday Night Football mark Mosley the record 33 trying to match that with a 35 yarder long time stealer is no good it's the upright so the 49ers get the big third down play and came cash in they bog Don off the opening drive 315 into the game San Francisco nothing Denver nothing so the Denver Broncos with no score first quarter takeover the first time John Elway's number OU's in his 15th season the man who has guided his team as a starting quarterback to one 37 career wins more than any quarterback in history first time the 26 yard line la gives the ball to Terrell Davis battery Sanders for the his first carry of the night is a sixyard game the ball came loose but after he didn't the ground what all makes the tackle the supporting cash for Elway Terrell Davis in his third year looking for a 2000 the blocking back Smith and McCaffrey of the wide outs and Shannon Sharpe the tight end Zimmerman Diaz Infante Nathan will go to the Pro Bowl is an alternate Habib and Jones the interior 5 from the 32yard line second down and four Davis again and Davis ones into his own Niner funny Randall right guys there yeah who ran that was a threeway collision a fascinating matchup tonight obviously everybody knows how well Denver runs the ball with Davis having over 1700 yards this is the number two run defense in the NFL here in San Francisco and that is just a case of Bryant young driving nailing back but the last couple of weeks the 49ers have been burned by Kansas City in Minnesota 150 343 yards is caught for a first down by Rod Smith Rod Smith coming into his own this season 62 catches stopped by Tim McDonald 15 yard gain in the first down Smith having a great year that story coming up for the practice squad 49er defense Barker young Stubblefield leads the league in sacks and dolmen Woodall Plummer and Norton the linebackers and the secondary the great wanton Woodson with Marquez pulled back from an injury McDonald and Hanks to the safeties big time defensive leader first down at the 44 yard line Griffith the table from Caroline as a free agent mainly of blocking back occasional wall carrier stop by folk came to three Dan talked about the forty niners being number two in the league against the run Mayer number one against the pass so they have had a great year defensively yeah it's just the last couple weeks Steve Mariucci and the staff a little concerned that they've been founded on when you're only giving up an average of 82 yards a game to give up double those numbers the last two weeks is a cause for concern especially preparing to head into the playoffs they that up tonight second down and six the bass is high and 10 for Rod Smith oneonone with Marquez bulb it'll be third and six overthrown by John Elway he shakes his head he knows he should have had that one Rob Smith hooked up for the first down in front of Marquez Colt Marquez Pope was out so many games came back last week after being injured in the second game and this was just a little too much smoke on it down a little keyed up early in the game here six or receivership the answers away and then it's income Raj Smith couldn't hold on Rod Woodson might have got the hand he was close to it Goodson a terrific story Woodson Pittsburgh he sits right in his face and then the little handful of him as he comes across Dan but he's over there he's on that thing all the way doesn't even have to extend himself hardly to make a play on the football Rod Woodson is tall over eating up that covers heating up that route by Smith ruins upon the eleiza gay is the laser came drops it at the 11:00 it's a lot of football hit by John Mobley the linebacker who's also great on special teams and Denver has it so AZK dancing at the 11:00 dropped it Dedrick dodge the former 49er comes up with it but John Mobley created the play Jennifer is in Eden now for the fair cuts as hard to believe NFL terminology that's a muff never had possession and it just goes right through his it right off his shoulder pads I think that's a pancake there he took a tremendous shot Mobley very active very athletic but the ball was long gone before Mobley hit him the ways of Kade no chance that wall hits him right to face with the face man the shoulder pad you can only assume that he lost that somewhere in the lights away GK has fielded thousands of punts most of them I'm sure a lot better than that a second fumble cut in the last four games first and goal the sexes that I can't picks up the couple to the 4yard line it'll be second down and goal junior Bryant in on the tackle with less than nine minutes to go in a scoreless first quarter another look at the muffed punt hard to think it would be the lights though it's coming right straight down but it did it got him right in the shoulder pads for the facemask and and then he just got creamed there's not a lot of wind fact for here at Candlestick point a very very calm night but a ways that came misjudging where this ball is going to drop it asked great the face man it is second down and goal Davis Davis gets in for the touchdown so I want a picture of power by a 210 pound running back he does I've said it over and over he plays like a 240 pound running back and you had a great view of his legs just driving and pounding and pushing and forcing the pile into the end zone looked like they were on skids the entire 49er defensive unit that was in position watch these guys just slide back into the end zone give a lot of credit to the left side think about the offensive line of Denver head McCaffrey Zimmerman Diaz Infante that's just superb Elam for the point after that is the 15th touchdown of the season for Terrell Davis ties a team record that he said last year the milehigh salute 7 upping Denver neil smith the longtime Kansas City chief comes over to Denver and he'll be going to the Pro Bowl and John Elway who's just guided his team with Shannon Sharpe off his shoulder to a 7nothing lead as the 49ers have it at their own 22 yard line first drive resulted in a missed field allocation joining us and Steve Young gets con tied by Alfred Williams Alfred Williams and Neil Smith are both playing hurt they have had a real problem with torn tricep muscles in their arm and Alfred way to the Pro Bowl in a year ago and he's just getting back he's a little healthier than Neil Smith is but a big play there notice nobody touched I'm trying to figure out what Derrick theis is doing over at left tackle as he just waves at Alfred Williams who goes to the inside and just lets him go that's a bob McKittrick not going to be happy that's a blow up front by somebody and Alfred very smartly doesn't drive Steve Young into the ground Bryson on second and 20 that was a 10yard sack that direction poet by Gerry up to the 28th fifteen weeks after the off a 16yard reception that is consecutive streak having a reception in how many games the 176 I believe he's trailing only art month that's 177 now and every person in America who has had surgery on a knee that's watching this game is now scratching their head and utter disbelief myself included raycrockett hit him third down and 4 for the Purvi and he's tackled at the 30yard line Romanowski and that short of the first down so forth down rice comes out kind of appropriate his first reception is a 16 yarder with Montana's number getting retired tonight Largent with the second longest street and month with the longest streak and rice could get that next year armed with 183 tommy Thompson the punt and rice was saying before the game he said one of the reasons I spotlighted tonight I said tonight's the night was because Joe gets his number retired and he also said it gave him a goal to shoot for tommy thompson twoputt short kick but letting it go was Darien Gordon and it is down at the 42 yard line perhaps you heard of him the 82nd guy chosen in the 1979 draft Joe Montana looking on from a suite at the half to be retired in a ceremony Carswell and he's taken down for no gain second enemy Davis finds very vulgar all flag comes in Ken Norton may have had a face mask may have had him by the face mask and Phil look at a rookie referee refereeing his first Monday night game will make the call well the flag was thrown by the umpire who's standing right behind Ken Norton face mask on the defense number 51 five yards on which is still second down not flagrant so it will be second down but that was certainly unnecessary seeing there about six other guys headon even stopped and there you see at the top of the picture see the lefthand of Kenny Norton not often you see a running back pointing to a facemask while it's happening Davis's six Davis is forced out of bounds close to a first down just inside the 48 by birth Hank boy he is bruising that's twice he is this bold Hank's over I'm not sure he was for steady birth by birth then almost a pig's head off but only in the game the first time he carried the ball down you and I both saw it he ran right over Hanks well talk about running big that's what Terrell Davis does he's only 210 pounds but he thought this is not the way a 210 pound guy meets somebody he hurt you he hurt her Hank's on that the 47 and stateís exploding through the hole Jen McDonald's stops him at the 40yard line a gain of seven thanks again bold overhangs you couldn't be a cheerleader out there a guy stopped him for he gets through to me and right now John Marshall the defensive coordinator the 49ers has to be thinking to himself look out now this is a couple of bad weeks defending the run and we're not off to a good start tonight as Terrell Davis chases Barry Sanders right up to the second he trails Barrie by a hundred 25 yards second down and three once one incomplete intended for Davis you know you'd think Barry Sanders is back home in Detroit resting easy tonight thinking that the 49ers haven't left a back get a hundred yards on them yet this season and that so his lead ought to be safe John Marshall they're the defensive coordinator the Niners but they've been gassed a little bit the last couple of weeks right now he's got to be a little upset and maybe thinking about walking his safeties up a little closer to the line Davis has carried seven times picked up the Blitz and sannen sharks first catch of the night and Shannon Sharpe who will be going to the Pro Bowl is the recipient of his 60th pass of the season standard sharplooking that right into the hands last week against the Steelers the Denver Broncos dropped with Mike sham an estimated to be 11 passes John Elway having a great game against the Steelers but they were dropping passes all over the field a week ago Shannon surehanded ordinarily mike shanin saying maybe they're getting a little too casual with it focus tonight they do go Davis's way a lot that's his 41st catch of the year Lee Woodall makes the tackle second on Davis taking down after a short game it is crisp Goldman and Lee would all converging on the stop dolmen having a terrific year Steve Mariucci says we are a veteran friendly organization indeed they are Golemon one attend guys 34 years of age or older on his team and one of nine guys on a defensive unit that has Pro Bowl experience assisting now he well in excess of 30 the passion from Smith much for a flag no Merton tanks tucked it away big year on his way to the Provo looking for his sixth interception plenty of time for John they pick up the Blitz you can see their thanks with good coverage Davis out of the backfield and stepping in front just timing it perfectly Matt Jason Elam this will be a 49 yard field goal attempt muddy surface and books back through the uprights started to the right drew it back in Denver ants three they lead 10 nothing Gary Plummer going over things on the 49ers sideline the 49er defense you can't really blame them for a 10 nothing deficit right now it's the way Zack a fumble that led to a six yard touchdown drive of sorts and then a field goals made attendant up it back to the 20yard line buhbye Steve Ross George Stewart these special teams go to the 49ers pacing the sideline and here's tonight's the Home Depot coaches back seven current NFL head coaches where at one time or another assistance with the 49ers Pete Carroll the Patriots whose kozilek Bengals Jeff Fisher Oilers and his green Vikings Mike Holmgren Packers Ray Rose Eagles and Mike Shanahan is across the way tonight the Denver Broncos head coach all seven at one time or another coaches here assistants in Steve Mariucci winds up getting the job after one year West Coast offense all over the elephant Kirby except for couple the irony is then at one point at Mike Shanahan decided to stay three years ago and if Seaford had not been here this year that Mike would have been the 49er coach he took a lot of a whipping and we're gonna him tonight but they've made in 95 and then last year thirteen and three and could very well be that again this year second day for the 23 yard line Collins Owens and JJ Stokes in the absence of rice this season have been able to emerge and there is jury awaiting his next opportunity but but Owens really had to step up along with Stokes and they've done that there's a typical West Coast pattern but a twoyard book by a wide receiver in the slot this is this is a reason the quarterbacks throwing percentages have gone way up in this league stadium 60 87 and that's why that's a pretty high percentage pattern nice back in the game pressure Steve Atwater was blitzing throws it out of bounds and so it's fourth down and the 49ers sputtering here in the first quarter well a beautifully timed blitz by Atwater right between the center in the guard no 49er there to pick it up and Steve Young had no choice it was just real so much of a blitz is timing look right on the right side there comes at water right between the center in the guard and Steve Young almost got caught on his ankle there that's just really well timed by this seventime Pro Bowlers Steve Atwater intended to Jerry Rice he just had to throw away tommy Thompson to fun court under pressure from the corner expires and a leaf flag has come in at the end this flag came in when players were already headed for their respective benches Randy Kirk number 57 he was right in the middle of it and George Stewart doesn't look any too happy with his special teams linebacker personal foul unnecessary roughness the kickin team number 57 first down quarterinch is the first time this season the Niners have allowed 10 points of the open a quarter end of one Denver 10 San Francisco nothing and Monday I have football resumes into this message and a work for ABC stations city by the bay San Francisco site of Monday Night Football week 16 we begin the second quarter now Michaels thank you for dandy two yards picked up to the 39 he's tackled there by Venus Stubblefield well the Broncos led last week 21 to 7 at Pittsburgh and watched that evaporate they had a 13 nothing lead at Kansas City in the game they eventually lost and tonight up on top again as you look at Gary Kubiak the offensive coordinator something Mike Shanahan has preached to his team and it's a luxury on the road to be up early and take the crowd out of it a little yet they've squandered that extremely disappointing second half on a 38yard that's McCaffrey covers by Morton third down take a look at the numbers through the first 15 minutes to play the key play in the first quarter it was a waste case unless the totals are anything less than impressive well certainly not much from San Francisco on the ground only two yards rushing and only one first down offensively not much of a quarter at all for the No and throws an adjusting on a pattern but dropping and it's incomplete was Rod Smith he was able to come back get position the ball was there dropped it the litzen was on the coverage but John Elway bought some time in the pocket on the Blitz and as he does so well moved around and still being able to pick up the receiver and Ron Smith just dropped it well again Frank you talked earlier documenting the drops and that's just right on the hands of Rod Smith a tremendous effort by John Elway once again wasted by a Denver receiver just plain dropping the football on the subject of drops since a ways okay dropped the punt Rod Woodson goes back to field this pun he used to do a lot of this early in his career Pittsburgh and very successful D'Andre kicker is Tom ruined Woodson from the 16 is a flag thrown and to the 26yard line far as well gets into it with luck that's what's his first punt returns as Rick Dennison barks the special teams goes from the sideline rod had not returned to PUD since 1994 in Pittsburgh before he had the reconstructive knee surgery well one thing we know for sure there was something along the lines of an illegal block in the back by the 4200 block in the back above the ways of the receiving team first down at sec bronson a reserved defensive back watch on the left side of the street there it is right out in the open whoa tough to get away with that then for leading ten to nothing 49ers trying to rip up homefield advantage throughout the NFC playoffs go to 12 of 3 throws and it's caught by it takes it up to the 24 yard line really stepped up big time this year you mentioned averaging 15 and 1/2 yards per reception good athlete big six three tough for a defender and crackit playing way awful under spec team the speed and first down 49ers well the motion of the 49ers rotated the the secondary of the Denver Broncos to the other side of the field really leaving Crockett alone as San Francisco second first down young frozen held and it is not down by Darius Johnson intended for JJ Stokes dangerous best second down Stokes is the other read receiver for the 49ers that has stepped it up since the lawsuit Jerry Rice in that first game he's big he's six for good coverage here by Johnson see really just a little late getting the ball there unusual for him dogs of all deployed breaks a tackle of the backfield miss fullback in the league Bar None picks up five Coit Tower fabled San Francisco landmark and in the foreground pier 39 afar from Fisherman's Wharf back into threecount Park we've come through down and seven at the 27yard Meno to Brent Jones and his longtime roommate on the road has a first down after the 50 defense maybe not the best Blackie tight in you're gonna have a round but he certainly is a good receiving tight in they often move him into the stop as they did here big hole Steve Atwater number 27 there on the stop Brent Jones he's got a great first away from a defender you saw it there problem the 49er first in 10 San Francisco Floyd in the Bronco territory the 47 yard line shackled by Gordon garrison first who came over this year and look at the spark he's provided a thousand year our season but a broken collarbone and they think they've hope he's back for that January third or fourth playoff game and the 49ers this year actually are running the football more than they are passing the football but that is because of garrison Hearst being healthy I think it's apparent tonight that against this Denver Bronco team they're throwing the football much more than they would like to it's been almost all Steve Young to this point second down and six and now it is inside the 45 short of the first tackle by Romanowski a third and short they're going to try to get what they can get out of Kirby they're going to try to get maybe ten or so out of William Floyd but the loss of garrison Hearst has really affected the way Steve Mariucci their head coach calls a football game he'd like to bang it in there with earth 25 times a game Kirby very versatile he's a good running back he's just not the power runner that Hurst is good receiver out of the backfield nice back in the game third whistles no clue job by Steve Young at the 49ers little ng out there tonight a lot of stake here tonight this was a third and three well Steve gave at a heck of a hard count even from our vantage point Claire here you can see his entire body give a tremor when he barked out almost went offside myself yeah he who both flinched it was a good one don't shake tremor around here not where we're sitting that's the hit Bob no no you can touch Steve right there as a matter of fact Steve wasn't even expecting the ball Chris Dolph in the Sooner man false start offense peace flagged for a penalty Linna chris doumitt when you say though Dan well the center can't be offsides he could snap at whatever he wants they thought that Derek theis gave some kind of a flinch let's see let's see if we can see a little bit I think Steve was expecting the ball and just didn't get it dereck thief's never moved I don't Derrick teeths never moved at all that's 49ers kind of got waxed a little bit on a phantom cool let's throw down a name it is in rice could be rice what surgery diving catch it's his left knee that was surgically repaired on this pattern breaking to the left sideline he's got to play it let's take a look at he's gonna have to plant on the left knee right there now he doesn't plan on it hard but he does it just enough to make a cut to the outside Frank I just can't watch this and I can't believe what I'm seeing well I know you've had yours cut on several times and I haven't but I've been around it so much in my life he's wearing a brace and I think it's bothering him first down from the 39 is Kirby going Jerry Rice two catches tonight among if he scores a touchdown tonight among all of the other things that would surround something like that it would give him an even 1000 points for his career I think with Jerry Rice and Steve Mariucci would really like is to walk up the tunnel together with Jerry Rice being helmet absolutely and forget about saddle next week and start thinking about the bye week second at 11 and then throws and puts it in there perfectly for William who pulls it in at the 28yard line and holds the sticks runs down what a catch on the part of Floyd who came up in 94 as a first round draft pick that horrendous knee injury in 95 but he was a real surprise to the 49ers of what a good receiver he was nice pass pressed by the Broncos huh watch him go down concentrate on this football diving catch scoops it up good effort first out of the 28 that is caught by JJ Stokes the 18yard that's close to a first actually directing traffic well and whilst moving to the inside um didn't like that and watch him break to the inside here now Jung said no move over here and so typical the 49ers when they are in their offensive rhythm everybody gets to touch the football and they get to touch it all over the football field whether it's Brent Jones split as a wide receiver Stokes Owens Kirby everybody participates in a 49er Drive when they're it's Williams elevated yeah that's just saying dese pulled him off why not they got it one time before Wendy stood poof go to the well and try it again the deesis time might have flinched a little bit the amazing thing here is peace might have flinched a little bit it's this it's like hot even doubt it's like hockey you call the wrong penalty you got to even think that right what a great story this offensive line and the 49ers is though at the beginning of the season they didn't know what they were going to use and they lined up different than offensive line almost different in every game to in preseason and finally settle down about the third weekend of the season first and five for the thirteen and they give it to Kirby and Sturridge Keith trailer the first guy to hit him this drive began at the forty nine or eight yard line just a minute into the second quarter now we're halfway through the quarter and the Niners have marched all the way down to the 14 numbers on this drive William Floyd is being looked at on the bench the trainers second down and six rights in motion young close thank you that's a thousand points taking the ball with you good move against Gary holds on to it takes a shock it all right there well the one thing that's apparent Jerry's hands they're just goodbye Anderson he's the only man to score a thousand points with none of them from his foot the only non kicker to do it and you believe it 107 big numbers especially when you're daft end nothing 92 yards in almost half the quarter the wife's reception it's 10:00 to 7:00 and the kick is taken at the floor falls down slips again and it turns out to be a perfect ankle cuff and somebody does a full summer soil Braunstein is there to give your book evil provides this shot tonight in San Francisco next week the dolphins and the Patriots here 107 Denver leaves it Broncos have it they begin this drive from the 39 we would all in butchering it Guerry plumber came in as well and boy they really clogged the middle and when john elway is forced to give ground of course like any quarterback when he could run parallel to the line of scrimmage he's got a chance of doing something really dangerous when you come from the middle and force him backwards John having to give way too much ground smartly just gets rid of it nobody close for the 49ers to make second attack from the pantry makes the catch tweeted immediately by Rod Woodson at the 18yard line a third and five Caffrey is the kind of received at the Woodsen likes to go up against Blitzen is a gambling cornerback and where he probably doesn't have the speed that he had when he came up he still got pretty quick then McCaffrey does he just got a lot of moves with Woodson doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to anything he just plays a very tight very close will gamble a lot he's right there and it's a pattern that's really dependent upon the defender missing the tackle to pick up a first down away from the gun average accept the coverage is illegal Tyrone Drake furred and his arms wrapped around Willie Green well the green of course came from Carolina as a free agent pass interference on the defense well drink for it first of all it's like he knows this pattern is coming talk about sitting on a pattern played it well we sure did he's all over this thing he's right there well that's well the original C play behind throws a flag so he's throwing at maze gone Drake firts left hand and left arm which may have grabbed the Jersey is able to see from behind has to capitalize we've got flags again what Smith thanks the guy we talked about Woodson playing it very tight gambling that time he came up against rod smithy and no question he was holding Smith holding defense push down Winston was playing that for a fiveyard stop in Smith gave him a little motion like he was going to do that and then broke to the outside Woodson had no choice the reality of it is on a first down play it's only a fiveyard penalty it's still first down it moves the chains but it's only a fiveyard penalty if Rod Woodson doesn't hold him NASA misjudging the play to the inside you're right it might have been a touchdown and the grand scheme of things not that big he's a gambler in the corner but 5:48 to the half directing traffic launches one for Smith is count about Burton Hanks is their oneonone with it no question he was out of bounds but Elway again directing traffic trend to get what Rod Smith the turn upfield and he did in Elway put it up there just gamble that he could take it away from Hanks B comes down out of bounds there's the battle on the sidelines first foot coming down out of bounds nice job by Rod Smith going up for that football he really out battles tanks for the ball that was a superb effort on his part would have been a foot wider he'd had something always got a lot of confidence seconded Sam go back to Davis and Davis takes the ball to the 36 yard line they're by Brian Young again the situation is this if the 49ers win tonight home field throughout the NFC what would that mean it means at Green Bay faces the 49ers in the NFC Championship game it's here if they don't win tonight they could win it next week there's a quarterback comparison tonight young with 161 in the touchdown Elway the 28 is just how to keep pace with they lose the tiebreaker but at least it wound up has been over for SI matches made by sharp at the 50yard line and he takes it to the 49 or 42 tackled by McDonald in a first down from Denver what a great read between Elway and Shannon Sharpe Shannon Sharpe has been quiet in the first quarter and end of the second quarter of at that time no coverage at all Hank's creeped up to the line of scrimmage Elway read it sharp read it now watch this 46 10 McDonald coming up he nice easy eight a mistake I got to be covering the title and he blows it Elway and Sharpe both read it on that blitz switch off McDonald has to come out and take Shannon Sharpe and that is just a major medal they're allowing a guy of that receiving capabilities to run free fortytwo on first down is really green boughs whoo how close was that well they're discussing and that two officials and they both seem to agree on it how close is this that's a call that I don't want to have to make and an official on either side of it they make this at top speed and we can look at it in slow motion you must come down with both in bounds and from that angle looks like a mighty good call yes a left heel the left heel looks like it lands out of bounds when you look at it from that angle would you have to like to call that now the heel comes down and the rights in the left heel looks it lands outofbounds that's a heck of a ball rustles into the turf for a loss of water under four minutes to go and this crowd getting ready for the electricity at halftime Joe Montana to have his jersey number 16 retired san Francisco's defense settling down a little bit taking the Denver Broncos out of what they would like to do and that is to get five six seven yards on first down with Burrell Davis running the football to a passing game Broncos it's picked off for the down and pull brings it back to midfield marker down back into 28th for the interception took place at hope it's on the return could have been offensive any chance to pass interference defense number 23 one Bank first down Denver I think Willie green is the receiver to that side of the field he's going to run a post pattern going to go down about 10 yards bring it right there in the upper right hand there's no Dante yet hope this reaches out with his right arm and sells Willie green away you just can't hold your ground and push a guy off like that what we have is that three enter when we have two interferences and a defensive holding on this one Drive to the 26yard line Tim McDonald to the tack looked like a change at the line of scrimmage by John it looked like everyone was not in sync with him second down and eight now then draw the move to 45 to go in the opening half Kevin green now playing defensive end for the 49ers they tried to put him to the open side of the field he plays it Woodson heparin and Griffith are in this game for the Broncos because they're looking at Terrell Davis on the bench with Gary Plummer and John Elway and a little joing match and that's serious problems for Denver is Terrell Davis gets a looksee from the trainer's well that's a risky throw by John because Woodson sitting all over McCaffrey when well played to no left hand on the back death in to draw flag I made the decision to throw he's standing right next to McCaffrey we wondered why well Davis on the bench takes a timeout with a third down and eight upcoming third and eighth the line of scrimmage is 226 they work on Davis Denver leads fivethree but did i football live on the web and you can pick it up at ABC M and F dotcom that's the address has a big play coming up here third down and 27 yard line Davis out of the get out of the shotgun 2:29 errs come on a blitz L he's governed by Pope and it's fourth down with inside wishes both with inside help from bronze and they had him blanketed Elway just basically throwing that away that Elam comes on for a field goal attempt full of roughly 44 yards as the outside coverage by Pope watch the 31 come from the inside Elway saw it just do it out of the end zone is no why and DeBartolo will be presenting Joe Montana at the half as you know he resigned this Chairman and as a director of the 49ers as Steve Young on first down Jones makes the cash in the flag goes in a moment but any resign as the chairman and director of the Niners because he wanted to distance the team as much as possible from an investigation by a federal grand jury in Louisiana into his involvement in an application for a riverboat gaming license his sister is now assuming the roles that he had Denise shorten holding defense number 53 the pillory is the result to the play as a first down first after San Francisco bill wolf will also be a part of the halftime ceremony so a lot going on at the half bill Romanowski all over Brent Jones as he tries to come off the line of scrimmage breaks to the outside gets the completion and also gets to pass him very small boy I hate to hold a guy that bad then still have him go downfield to catch the pass did not doing Utah fees Wow at least effectively first a Niners at the Denver 49 go ahead those caught by Joel young and Jones they call themselves Klugman The Odd Couple and they are he's a lot of fun David bean walk Denver is just turning Jones loose on the inside which ones back though which ones Klugman here this has got to be Fletcher first down 49ers the 49ers have it at the 25yard line first down three Jones that time John Mobley came blitzing through and leveled Leon then would have had a fraction more once again Brent Jones was wide open with justly letting him roam across the middle I pick him up on the outside but he's when they go into double coverage on the outside he's wide open good look at Terry Kirby also open but you can see Brent Jones wide open inside the five yard line but the pressure from Mowgli didn't allow Steve Young the time second and ten it on against the first down stops the clock talk about his ability out of the backfield as a receiver very rice powder only did his me there's a little problem for him but doctors told him to forget about time on 49ers 1 left tonight Jerry Rice 15 weeks after surgery huge ovation before the game and they got him right into the thick of things early on it makes this catch this first catch since opening day follows this one with a diving catch near the sideline and then voila into the end zone a thousand points in that stellar career three catches tonight 40 yards Jerry Rice safety Darian Gordon after what happened to him yes he think been last week and everyone all focused on Jerry Rice and it's very in Gordon in the coverage again Gordon then you get in the barrel you get in the barrel it's hard to get out not many secrets Ernest a garlic first down hates a sack inside the tan slides will and Steve wants to conserve the timeout calling for the huddle the time and Steve Young would have tried through the end zone this is a much wiser Steve Young he would have tried to go right over the top of somebody through somebody you're right and that's a Steve Young the Steve Mariucci his coach is very happy to see second and three and romanovski makes this the all inside the wine time for the 49ers no need to take a timeout now they they can play the double game here get it in and take all the time Worcester Denver has done great trap block fair for Kirby huge opening by the 49ers trailer comes out he led showoff the one Nature's Way in for the touchdown Floyd with the lead block going behind huge Kevin Gogan 330 pounds of rightguard almond at center Strafford two right tackle executed play on the goal line there's nothing fancy about this here we come try to stop it Denver could what after breakdown the 49ers point deficit rice and company and neil smith and his club watching another road lead evaporate as it did in pisa city as it did last week in pittsburgh a team known for finesse no finesse here one of the oldest plays in the game a 49er touchdown and Steve Young all over it on this Drive the way he executed and moved his ballclub down for the score Tyron Brexton up into the air but doesn't have enough going for him to repel Kirby good news for the 49ers Oh offensively Garrett garrison Hearst out of the least until the first round of the playoffs not sure he'll even come back there Jerry Rice has already scored his touchdown tonight probably will not come back into the game but Terry Kirby with that pretty good show tonight good receiver we know that out of the backfield but also running hard today well if the 49ers secure homefield advantage Gary rice doesn't have to play a football game for 20 days he will not play next week in Seattle because it's on an artificial surface and this surface is very knee friendly so there's such a service a big three weeks for Jerry Rice when you look at where he is now how much better that knee will be if he comes out of this thing on skate Wow a job for the tech the Broncos have not returned a kickoff for a touchdown brings it back to the 26 yard line so 14 ticks left for Elway Joe Montana the retirement ceremony coming up at halftime tonight I'll have a chance to take a retrospective look at the career of of Joe and then they will bring down the house in San Francisco and the only people unhappy about it the concessionaires it's not too many people figured to leave their seats at halftime tonight first down from the 26 yard line Stubblefield makes the tackle and this is the way the first half will end so the Broncos thing but they leave the field down by we reached the hand and the San Francisco 49ers Broncos 14 to 10 and they're just warming up for the main event Joe Montana at halftime we'll return after this message from the National Football League and a word for ABC stations starting in 1979 this was a mystical time for the San Francisco 49ers Joe Montana came on the scene as Sir Lancelot came into Camelot in behalf of the greatest fans in the NFL in behalf of the greatest city in the world this man has etched his place in NFL history as the greatest quarterback that has ever played the game and now my dear friend it's taken me 19 years that I've been waiting to do this we are retiring number 16 forever with our grateful gratitude to Joe for what he did for all of us god bless you thank you huh thank you very much I would just like to say start off by saying that I'm very honored to be standing here tonight back in 1979 when I first stepped onto this field I never imagined that with be in this position tonight having my number retired when I look back on on all those years I think we all should feel a little gratitude I know I do too individual who I believe is probably one of the greatest men caring giving that I've ever come across in my life I would like to say personally say it was an honor playing on his team and behalf of my wife and kids and myself we love you Eddie and thank you but I also have to thank another gentleman up here tonight who who I feel was just a bigger part of making this turn around in this organization not only in helping my career and my success in the NFL but also making this team what is shaping up to be even today and that's bill loss I thank him I thank you for having those that faith in that little skinny legged kid back Terrance in 1979 I also want to say thank you to some two people very special to me my mother and father for all the sacrifices they went to to enable me to do these things that I needed to do to get here I want to thank my wife and children for being patient with the crazy schedule of the professional athlete because she was always there for all the support whenever I needed it those little back rubs on Monday morning I also want to say thank you to a bunch of guys and there are none of them up here because if I tried to get them all up here that would have taken us forever to assemble all my teammates over the years because without them I certainly would not be here I thank them and I thank as Eddie alluded to earlier other the greatest fans anywhere in the greatest city anywhere thank you for your support on the current affair back in San Francisco Al Michaels with Frank Gifford and Deirdre for Lynn Swann as we start the second half and the Broncos will be getting the ball as the 49ers kickoff tommy Thompson back to receive it that's a shortcake eighteen yard line at the 30yard line by Jim schwanz if John Elway comes in what a night incredible excitement rice coming through neither team rushing the ball very well but the huge advantage in yardage going to the San Francisco 49ers and of course a questionable status of Terrell Davis you know Denver would like to get back they're really pounding the football davus not in the lineup Rocksmith escapes poke comes close to a first down and very emotional at the happen and Joe looks like he could still play in great shape looks terrific well you know he's such a awful looking guy it must be terrible to have to go through life with those baby blues but when you look at how many franchises in this league have never tasted success you realize that the 49ers cup runneth over when it comes to great football players and the wonderful victories I've had here very very lucky 82nd Chevron seats the first and gets it he keep thinking back the barn will bought the team in 77 they had two horrible years and loss comes in and fixed Montana and you know since that day this team has not only won five Super Bowls they've been in contention every season you know when you think back and I think back over the many years of covering Joe and watching him play he's one of those players that could do everything so easy and then at the end of the game you'd look at it hit thrown for 300 yards four touchdowns and you he just was not impressive he didn't do it in a quick really just said it's so easy so graceful treats of course the 50yard line of the close to a first down Burton Hanks makes the stun I guess if you wanted to just summarize the forty niners and what has happens it said to Barlow bought this club I guess you could simply say they have written the book on how to do it the most copied team in the National Football League the most copied organization and football everyone has taken some of the ideas that the 49ers started and tried to implement them into their own system and he just saw part of it Shannon Sharpe coming across that's 40 minor office taken to the Denver Broncos by Mike Shanahan it was short of the first and edie's we've talked about it and it's been welldocumented recently the perspective troubles for Eddie DeBartolo but let's not forget that scene tonight when Eddie DeBartolo gets introduced and he had to wait to introduce Joe because 60,000 people are chanting Eddie Eddie that's what the chant was what if you try to the other 29 owners out around the National Football League what would happen risk well I know a few that there there would be a chant go on this would be but it wouldn't necessarily be there thank you here enough table Woodson meant that play he was out lined up over at the wide receiver he read the formation read the play that comes from a lot of looking at tape and gambled as we talked about it earlier you took the shot and he held him short of the first down coming from way off here he comes over 26 coming in behind and has enough strength I'm not certain Carl David but this is a major blow for the chose the Terrell Davis and the rest of this football the backhand to the three yard line while I set that up nicely yes little Mike Shanahan was talking about him last night he said he is a football player he's got a lot of quickness we want to get him in there we want to working but what can you do with a Terrell Davis and Vaughn Everett makes the big play for Denver right there wellness 49ers certainly were obliging with absolutely no backside pursuit whatsoever when Vaughn Hepburn cuts back there is nobody in a red jersey very very smart play by Hebburn but a mistake by the 49ers on the backside Drake furred saves a touchdown and also gets a little bit of the facemask 46 yard gain laughing one for watch Smith he is three times tonight Branko receivers have come down with a football but on the chalk well we thought they had that one he loves this to McCaffrey and also to Shannon Sharpe who gets comes down with one foot though talk about it again positioning by the official as one when the left one does not get down that's the way it's supposed to be done by the side judge got some good calls tonight it's inside the one but no farther third down and goal right now the the 49ers are going to have to adjust to the way they're going to attack the running back Terrell Davis not a real shifty guy his style of running his power he'll take you on try to go over you certainly with Vaughn Hepburn it's going to change he's going to cut he's going to change directions he may even do it behind the line of scrimmage Ronson that came from the corner it a clean tackle mike shanahan his field goal unit started to gingerly move out there for the 31 closing down right there gets up from the inside but the Broncos will go he's got it on him run into the end zone on 4th down set up by a 46yard run why would a lift that is to to get that punch that into the end zone take the lead this gives your entire team with your superstar Pro Bowl running back on the bench it gives your entire team a lift that you can punch it in when you have to over the left side he is in fatty and Gary Zimmerman over there with this good surges Auto high solute Vaughn hasn't had a chance to do a lot of that this year I guess his first rushing touchdown of the season it is the first touchdown he has scored in three years not since 94 as an eagle as he got into the end zone Denver by three Vaughan heparin coming off the bench and he'll have to be the guy out of the backfield the rest of the night Terrell Davis finished for the night and his chances at a rushing title probably finished as well as the kickoff he's taken by Chuck levy he'll bring it back to the 35 yard line update I'm Lynn Swann Lin well I spoke to Jerry Rice and he came onto the sidelines and put an ice pack on this bad knee he bruised that knee when he made the touchdown catch he said they drove him right into the ground on that knee but structurally it's fine it's no more swollen than there has been after practice during each day of the week Mary you she said he is probably not coming back into this ball game but he feels comfortable because the 49ers scored that touchdown at the end of the first half without Jerry Rice in the ball game out so he got him back into it at ten seven nowhere you can't ask for a better night for Jerry under the circumstances in Marion she was telling us yesterday he hasn't slept because of Jerry Rice and we said exactly why have you not slept this week and he said because I keep thinking about him getting reinjure well just take a look at that touchdown catch and we could see how Jerry bounced off that left knee just imagine if that would have happened on an artificial surface Jerry Rice would be more than just having a nice back on it he he'd be limping badly that's why he's only going to play early on a grass field that be playing next week in Seattle to the 40 his teammate comes in and draws the flag it was late coming the Romanowski as you said the former 49er got in there after Steve had applied the hooks live and I'll say it once again this is the news Steve Young I think there was a shot to the head that made them well it got the call and it's Romanowski 's head Romanowski tries to land on him with his helmet just not going to be tolerated going in and landing on somebody with your helmet being the primary source of watch him come in here watch his helmet watch we does with his hat right there that little dip with his hat and hitting Steve Young with his helmet is what got Romanowski in trouble Romanowski was in trouble in preseason he broke Harry Collins's jaw Chuck levy picks up a couple to the 43yard line several thought it was 20 or 30 pounds it was a whole bunch of money and put College on for the rest of preseason and in fact the carry was never written all year long no not to imply that bill Romanowski is some sort of a cheap shot artist because he's really not he's just a guy that plays the game really hard but that will get penalized time in time out when you land want somebody with your helmet being the primary point of attack Ray Brown is he heads to the 49er sideline their left guard Jesse Sapolu comes in and a second down over the it's JJ Stokes for a first down the 31 yard all kinds of first dozen Cipolla be only one I know of playing in this game that the has had heart surgery there he is now in his 15th year he was not going to come back he kind of talked him into it and he's filling in right now for Ray Brown but but a fine shot good concentration you lose a whole lot of beef and a whole lot of muscle at left guard when Sapolu replaces brown and there's a good look at harris barton a fixture tackle for so many years here are the 49ers the pass is incomplete intended for William Floyd Harris and I were talking before the game and he told me that he's had surgery on that knee and he fully intends to come back next year and play for this San Francisco ballclub and we talked about it earlier too and we ought to Richard Steadman outed to dr. Steadman out in Vail of Fame orthopedic surgeon and he said it's come along fine he intends to continue his career he gets that off in a couple of weeks he'll start his rehab and plans to be back and that's good news there's good people second down and 10 from the 31 Stokes flagged about exactly read every by Stokes this flags back at the pocket you're going to have roughing the passer I think called against Denver but a late pop against personal foul roughing the passer on the defenseman have to listen first they just won't tolerate the helmet on the helmet or leading with your helmet and that was also just a little late Alfred Williams coming in there it gets a good move and there again it's it's nothing big that hardly hurt Steve Young it's the action of that dip and then the striking them with a hat but that is just about as soft of the roughing the pastures you'll ever see first and ten Floyd for a couple to the nine yard line second down and eight here's play before that's JJ Stokes I think talking to bill Romanowski hmm ooh and there is a real lack of social graces on the part of Romanowski in any country second down and eight 9 complete intended for Owens raycrockett in the middle of the action they cracked it right in the middle of it throwing his body and he's having a terrific year so far Romanowski had a holding call a a personal foul for hitting Steve Young and a really real breach of etiquette a real breach of etiquette that's an unflagged breach of etiquette but a real loss of personal hygiene no penalties for expectoration semantics and drops incomplete Darien Gordon on the Cobra John Mobley coming in right in Young's face he have to deliver that a little more quickly than he wanted to I'm opening with a heck of a year you wonder why sometimes you you wonder about Pro Bowl loading period but John Mobley certainly had a Pro Bowl year by far and away the leading tackler the Denver Broncos Ernest you're right Frank I it wouldn't have been it's a surprise that he didn't go to a Pro Bowl mission there is no kick somebody's got it although Frank as we know in the Pro Bowl voting more often than not you're elected to the Pro Bowl a year after you really deserve it and a lot of to snap false start offense left guard five yards still fourth down if there's a good news to that equation a lot of times you get elected to a Pro Bowl a year after you don't deserve it anymore right occasionally you'll retire and in summary tech Montana probably got a voter to this year much publicized story in Denver raycrockett upset with the way that some of their guys filled out a Pro Bowl ballot this is a 32yard nerf for Gary Anderson to try to tie the game thirtythird he's kicked in his career on Monday Night Football tying mark Mosley in that department 381 in his career too shy of Nicklaus record the game tied at 17 from the 24 yard line for the game time Raj Smith his favorite target first down up at the 41 yard line away going down again staying in there so his receiver breaks open but he knew he's going to get the shot and he did for the 49ers coming with the Blitz and the Broncos effectively picking it up six six 49ers coming on the pattern and even though John takes a hit his guys formed enough of a pocket in front of me could a good look downfield and made the completion but they continue to pick up the 49er with for their secondary that is picked off five Merton Thanks thanks down the sideline six intercepts into the game that was another blessed by the 49ers and John had to rush it and John had to throw that did not even see Hanks Thanks absolutely free just looking into the eyes of Elway steps in front of it he's gone 55yard run back for burton hanks just have to think that Elway thought his receiver was going to break it off and that would be McCaffrey he didn't and Hanks came from centerfield and took it all the way in Ed McCaffrey ran a pattern of a receiver that did though there was a blitz going on certainly expected McCaffrey to break off his patterns he did not and Burton Hanks was a beneficiary career touchdown number five and his own salute Oh aand the Denver Broncos the interception by Hanks has given San Francisco a sevenpoint lead and Derrick LaBelle the former 49er will run this kick back for me watch the football but he has recovered as sack bronson created it I think Beland covered it up didn't he Tony Vila and the broncos flirting with a little bit of disaster here in terms of his he loses the football but vielen covers up if they lose tonight not only to the 49ers clinched home field throughout the NFC playoffs but a Denver loss means Kansas City clinches home field throughout the AFC playoffs had Poland step up to the 28yard time now for our Monday Night Football fact presented by Prudential who is the only player in history to catch touchdown passes from Joe Montana Steve Young and John Elway and the answer is it's not easy but I love it don't know Mike Gerrard and it started with Dallas in it he did 49er and now boy and giant only UCLA star who career was limited somewhat by two major leg three straight three straight blitzes now we're the 49ers against Elway and they're getting into his face well the country didn't sync up on the last one and we cost them six points been very disruptive third down seven Gary Kubiak the offensive coordinator John Elway everybody airs Damon mike shanahan from once again flag is thrown as no play whistle before the snap no play prior to the snap false start offense Jones all that movement can be very disruptive to see out of the corner of your eye the movement of a quarterback or line shuffling of the defense going on a silent snap count moves his leg the centers three to seven la guns of deep down Woodson's shaken which him shaken Rocksmith right in between the Woodsen and Tim McDonald that's not a healthy place to be and I think it's Woodson making contact with his own guy plowed right into McDonald coming over makes more contact with Woodson right there oh you see rod the front of his helmet just going right into the thigh of Tim McDonald we'll get a good look at it from this angle but watch the helmet right at the hairline whoo right there as he just crushes into the right hip of Tim McDonald Rod Woodson on the sidelines he got up and walked out off the field has a slight cut over off the field has a slight cut over his nose but it goes to be alright that Chuck leave he's the except there's punk for the 49ers who started the game with a ways okay then he must one they put Woodson back there now geckos back up the field day time check and for the 20 the fastest of the forty niners brings the wall back to the 34 yard line tackled by Glenn two drugs an ultimate weekend FL cement FL booze Marcus Allen 26 career TD's against the Chargers these news items brought to you by Budweiser ties the NFL record most TVs against any one team held by Jerry Rice 26 against Atlanta so Marcus Wright their Colts 41 zip over the Dolphins most lopsided win in the history of the league in which a team entered the game with seven fewer wins than the opponent Pat's dolphins next Monday night winner is the AFC champion from the 34 yard line is me man the 46 yard line flag down this flag comes sailing in from the field judge whose responsibility it is to to zero in on the tight end and his release from the line of scrimmage pass interference office number 84 fishing are still first down with Brent Jones pushing off the Tyrone Braxton but again John just didn't grow me around in the middle that field almost uncovered watching come off the line of scrimmage Romanowski doesn't even take give him a pop it pushes off of number 34 Braxton well many times I wouldn't have been called makes it first in 20 weather hit me Oscar Felix simile which shows either going into broadcasting or politics he says first at 120 holy except stupid Terry Kirby pick so 5 to the 29yard line often time they overlap defin rent brent has a lot of friends who would like to see him run for Congress and the Bay Bridge spanning San Francisco Bay conveniently shut yep look at that shot downtown San Francisco all the great saints in the world at second out of 15 I feel 49 Shaya the first of these tackle there by Crockett Denver with good coverage and the 49ers picked up and protect Steve Young but he had no place to put the football fortyniners marching what they hope will be inexorably toward homefield advantage in the playoffs and the the Broncos right now on the other side of a strangelooking coin that clerk was looking very shiny about a month ago and all of a sudden it's a home of a story here on third down and four tea wide open thinking the catches change a Stokes inside the 20 yard coming across the field flag down a player way back it's a lot of this happiest guy in this stadium is raycrockett cornerback who completely lost track at JJ Stokes he is not giving up a touchdown this year in coverage and he still hasn't that was a 60 yarder and that evaporates on a holding pool that will get eventually I saw it look it was announcing it but it didn't go out over the stadium PA and we didn't pick it up when he gave the signal for holding hee hee was it Chris dome in the center 67 good well again good should have been old and Keith traveler so it's third down and fourteen to some of the touchdown those two outside the series have really come around was against 67 Chris Coleman we look at it again and this is nothing was it I totally take down but again look at Owens across the middle where the 49ers have worked so effectively this evening Darian Gordon following Owens across the formation just too late to react and get in on the play fortyniner running play William Floyd for three fortyniners spreading it around six different receivers connecting up with Steve Young that's their offense that's a lot of production last week Young's first seven past completions were the seven different receivers spreading it around that's become the 49er mantra this year second down south works the sideline hey the first day that gets a shot in and romanovski it works me two roommates team up as Joan just came back to give the young a check off and comes up close to the first down I think Brent Jones reacting that at the end of this play Romanowski gave him his best shot and Brett Jones was still standing right here and brick Brent got the foot down took that one and flips the ball to Romanowski I think I took it and it didn't bother me at all they're former teammates second effort next before going to be asked to avoid employed should garrison Hearst not be able to back is playoff game right now when they go single back the two tight ends floyd is the main man he'll be carrying the football a lot more than he did before Hurst was injured but without Hearst e49 our offense is just philosophically different they're going to expect more from Steve Young our bootlegs perhaps the draw play waiting seconds but incomplete good coverage said John back there with a man Tyrone Braxton well with Burt garrison Hearst brings to them offensively when you look at Floyd he averages three yards to carry kirby about three and a half yards of carry the garrison Hearst with over a thousand yards was averaging almost four and a half yards of carry and he gives them an explosiveness that that is lacking from Kirby and Floyd neither one of those guys is really going to break off the big gainer he's there Terrell Davis yeah by far and away the fastest guy struck leaving but he's really not much of a threat from the line of scrimmage second of Ted and that will be the end of the third quarter San Francisco 24 Denver 17 monday night football resumed after this more ABC stations that chat coming to you from the Goodyear blimp eagle by above freaking Park in San Francisco Al Michaels with Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf and Lynn Swann we start the fourth quarter throwing and it's incomplete a little short and young goes down hard Owens covered by Crockett on the play me young is holding his arm as he comes off the field it was hanging it's better down play again he's been hit a lot tonight sit right on that left shoulder looks like he got here on the elbow looks like his elbow might have made contact with the helmet Trevor price made him pay won and the 49ers will punt Darien Gordon is back to receive Sally Thompson drops it inside the five just does bounce into the end zone Broncos takeover of the 2014 44 left in regulation Steve walking it off his team up by a touchdown the Broncos from their own 20yard line by 7:00 reaching in was Tyrone before McCaffrey Drake furred is taking Rod Woodson spot at the corner now the old zone blitz comes off the corner Dana Stubblefield drops back into coverage and Drake furred knowing the Blitz is on is playing the short patterns gambling that it's going to be a breakout by one of the wide receivers he was writing all over Rod Woodson second attend to give it to for all day was done for the night picks up three so Davis is done for the night Elway's numbers are very ugly tonight John is 11 of 27 for 79 yards when he's taken a lot of shots to after he's thrown the ball not sack that many times with he has taken some vicious hits seven out it's again and they convert big by Smith on a big beam all the way to midfield he's out of bounds at his own 49 single coverage if you pick up the Blitz and you get the completion you're going to get big yardage the Denver Broncos are their own 49yard line trailing by seven first and ten after that 26yard hookup later Smith on damn boy Antonia well it's been a tough year for Bryant young he has just been bothered by an ankle and a foot all season long has really never played the way he played last year and that's just an allout sellout talk about getting up field and trying to disrupt things it's like he's getting healthy just the right time down yeah hopefully hopefully he's getting back close but this is a game that Steve Mariucci said he wouldn't be playing too if Greenbay little lost Greenbay keeping the pressure on the 49ers forcing young to play titin sharp annotation to the 47 yard line another blitz for the 49ers who continue to come in our way in this path both would like to congratulate he and Annabel they had a little baby girl Christina join the family last Thursday and he is not happy with what's happening here tonight but is watching his team a month ago they were in such great shape and now all of a sudden looking at a wild card they lose tonight and we're next week and Jackson go on that's what this was one of the problems they had against the Pittsburgh Steelers we've talked about it all night right in the hands of Rob Smith as a couple he's lost tonight that was up close to the first town plenty of time for Elway couldn't put it in a better place eleven times they dropped the football against his Steelers it was fourth down and six so butts against the 49ers it's fourth down and one wonder if there's multiple fouls here George Stewart the Niner special teams coach it is a poll against ever at offside against the 49ers mm apply holding on the kinky team number 56 offsides on the right hand defense attorneys offset we play fourth down he burns the guilty Bronco James Williams for the 49ers since 78 when the NFL instituted buys for teams a hundred teams have played in that first round only three of Ghana the super I was looking squarely into the face of those numbers right as we say in a worstcase scenario a road two flags for them hitters into the end zone Anthony Lynn of the Broncos to call this a hold is to be very kind of generous Anthony Lynn guilty of an allout tackle the floating kicking team number 37 ten yards repeat fourth down look on the right side of your screen 37 you pick this is holding maybe so you thought Rick Dennison was bad before what do you think he feels like now let's try this again fatigue now becomes a bit of a factor covering a bunt for the third time and the one guy who's not critique is truck levy the rug back guy for the 49ers he's the fastest guy on the team at the 7th well certainly applaud by the 49ers that was pretty obvious all right Phil what's good at going the illegal formation on the offense for six men on the line of scrimmage Inigo four hands to the back on the receiving team number 51 this occurred after the change of possession by rule San Francisco retains the ball after their Pillai first down thank you yes only three pucks an unexpected break terrible field position for the 49ers so even after all the Denver mistakes it still works out for the Broncos from stoppage the winner wins Dan AFC East sad over the big comeback win yesterday over iterators yes erasing an 18point deficit biggest blown lead in the history of the Raider franchise as Dennis Erickson was exultant to the end a seattle victory is kirby picking up about four to the 11 yard line 11 and a half to go 49 news second down and five up on the 12 yard and JJ Stokes the intended receiver with only a touchdown lead nobody's leaving this early this game very much third down and five Enzo and then throws it away nobody opened and he's trying to go screen left and gender was all over he very wisely threw it away and it'll be a good field position for the Broncos or it should be it rarely has a team benefited from as many mistakes in the kicking game as Denver did in that last possession after after three consecutive mistakes punting the football they end up ending the 49ers at the 7 yard line the 49ers do absolutely nothing with it and now the Broncos are going to come out of this if they handle the putt cleanly with pretty good field position Joe Montana looks on Sally Thompson to kick from the end zone one of the best ever at running back hunts won't have the opportunity used to take and dies in the bog at the 41 yard line and the Broncos now have to be thrilled yes not only thrilled but also they're gonna have to capitalize because you're looking at a team that up until Peach Toyama bitch kicks a 54yard field goal at the gun into the wind appears to be solidly on its way to home field advantage throughout the playoffs to a team that right now is going to have to win if they lose here tonight next week to host a wild card game thirtyeight gamewinning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime and his career as Elway finally would all into Bronco territory taken down by Paul or did he just throw it to it off the 49ers came with no Flint just a straight fourman rush after a real high percentage number of blitzes coming after Elway this is just strictly a straight rush at his own drop yes Dana Stubblefield he did it they could deflect it intended for McCaffrey and right into Woodall's hands Dana Stubblefield hit it with his left hand if he's not having a bigenough year teen sex 'we caught in the traffic and now the 49ers look for the kill at the 11 yard line with 10 47 to go Willie rustles his way to the trevor price in on the tackle Stubblefield 15 sacks to lead the league amazing for an interior lineman he hasn't had a sack in the last three weeks he had built up an early lead and boy just a a really subpar night for John Elway and just like that it's not a poorly thrown Elway ball just unfortunate for the proper and this is a result second and seven from behind it was Alfred Williams saving what might have been a tuck Stan Williams wearing that cast like bandage on his right arm for that torn tricep both he and the Neal Smith both Smith have the same problem it is really painful I know that you'd like to refer to your end since bookends but I think it's taking it to the extreme that they both have exactly the same injury today puts his head down and comes close to getting a a little short here puts you up by 10 I got to do it officials time they're going to take a look at the the measure and 49ers want to see just how far short they are Watson lots of time left at 9:17 but you make it a two score ballgame with a successful field goal boy that's hard to pass up especially with that guy Gary Anderson who's as steady as they get may not be that close either almost a yard you got to send to Anderson oh boy and they do these to make him score twice Gary tonight has made a 32yard ER and missed a 35 yarder and again Anderson have to shy of Nick Lowery's record of 383 career field goals at this point in each man's career Lowery having played in 15 more games than Gary Henderson 20yard attempt Johnny Thompson behind puts them up by 10 with career field goal number 380 that's one way to crystallize it when you look at those numbers Steve Young is never up near where it is for the season and Elway 25.2 and you know it's a an esoteric situation basically and the John has not had any rating in a game that low since 1986 from the six yard line 4:49 are out past the 40 maybe grapefruit trying to run him down and finally does at the 32 yard line that that is exactly what the broncos needed at this point in the game to the dismay of George Stewart the Niner special teams coach we've got a Denver Bronco that's injured and down on the field back at the 31 yard line 61yard run back that's Duane Carswell the injured Bronco a couple of years ago this man LaBelle was the number one back for the 49ers and a lot of starts for the 49ers so it's a combination of some good blocking at the beginning of this return but then it's a case of Louisville breaking fortyniner attempted tackles and he broke about three of them on the way go to your blood eagle circling the moon first and ten from the 33 yard line deep the pants goes to the outside and we'll be green was curling back to the inside inside out coverage Pope on the outside and Merton Hanks on the inside and no way just basically throwing it away so many great stories tonight one thing we really haven't touched on I mean you go back now that he's on the verge of being 13 and to the 49ers the hiring of Steve Mariucci what I shocked it was last January and the way it's turned out right now August and they play Jacksonville here routed by the Jaguars and we left there going you know they could be big trouble second and 10 Dean yard line for a first down tackled by Bronson I think he proved his mettle when they came away from that first loss they went down to Tampa Bay and guests got bombarded down with young with a concussion they lose Jerry Rice and Nutt had to be about as low as you could get and he he kept his team together and he kept himself together and he's proven that he belongs in this league I think and he's a real class act right now trying to make a case that this game's not over five yards to the 10 yard while I'm tackled there by Zach Brompton when your offense is predicated on the running of Terrell Davis says Denver's offense has been all season long this is a tough way to shift gears for them nothing against Vaughn Hepburn but he's not Terrell Davis and you've got to do a lot of things differently Gary Kubiak walking the sidelines second and six Davis 20plus Terry's and four tonight show Narendra he picks up one here to set up a third the game Davis had carry tonight ten times for 28 yards evarin has now carried 12 times for 64 yards of course he had the big run some 136 yards a lot of it is just when the guys look around the huddle when you've got a 1700 yard ball player that's a guy that everybody in the huddle looks to and is used to seeing and all of a sudden you subtract somebody with that kind of productivity from from the huddle a lot of its psychological there's a it's natural to lose a little confidence I'm Lily gray I'm doing you can run the football I said well Davis you control the football a lot easier la angry but at least they're in position to make it a sevenpoint game again well John agreed himself I think al he had a wide open receiver and John just throws away from him back behind him Willie Green has absolutely no chance to react back to that football this is a that hurts that's a killer at this point Elam not exactly having a strong night today boy that's he's normally pretty did with that thing he made a 49er missed a 44 and now misses a 29 and was 6:37 remaining in regulation the Niners are that far away from home field throughout and that far away from giving Kansas City homefield throughout the AFC and I suspect that our audience in Kansas City is pretty big I don't think anybody's give them a lot of credit for what they've done who's the starting quarterback what six weeks ago we filled up now five straight wins big wins from the 20yard line on first down if this continues we'll be in a situation next week where they will either have to beat San Diego at home and they'll be heavily favored to do that or have Jacksonville lose to the moribund Raiders next week in Oakland but if Jacksonville were to win and Denver were to lose then Denver would have to play Jacksonville in the playoffs in Florida in Jacksonville and that is a scenario that nobody in Denver was envisioning five weeks ago impossible second down and three taking the police it's an app in the 21 third and one Steve just a glance of the play clock a guy who can take that all the way down if he picks up the first down here he really puts Denver in a vine bees they need a couple of timeouts and then there they'll be forced to start thinking about taking time out on defense well this is precisely the situation and why the 49ers have added so much muscle up front Ray Brown at 3:15 Goggan at 3:30 this is not the old 49er line where a lot of finesse was necessary it's a one second a third and but the bestlaid plans go awry here he sits fourth down oh you go with the delay that's that's a wild call that's that's not getting a chance to use your muscle I thought it was more like a draw play yeah you're talking third and one you know Denver's defense is certainly not thinking any kind of pass so the draw loses a lot of effectiveness yeah that's not power football that's the strange girl yeah and now the 49ers we'll send it down to Darien board Gordon ran over and at lunch it bounced and it bounces out of bounds near midfield well he thought about it well once again Denver gets excellent field position they have had three or four possessions here where they hit they cannot complain about where they've started on the football field and they've done very little with it 49 or defense here in the second half is really tough enough here the second half right down the football in fact it is loose and it scared of green who comes up to the football he's got a store have it in brain touchdown the goalies came out of the file this would have not blow had a hard time picking it up well John couldn't find anybody downfield he just could not find a receiver couldn't pull the trigger good coverage downfield just ready see the ball coming out of the pile and the Broncos none of his offensive linemen who are back there are aware that the ball is loose only Harry Swain number 74 is giving any kind of pursuit at all Rocko's find themselves in a midst of a nightmare after by Anderson Greene scores the third touchdown of his career a guy who led the league in sacks last year held out didn't report to the Carolina Panthers they released him the 49ers that veteranfriendly group is kind of a luxury to the 49ers they really had no place to play then all of a sudden Laurie Barker went down with an injury and he's been able to fill in for Barker's so the luxury turned into a necessity on the part of the 49ers and it just turned into a touchdown for Kevin Green least he didn't dive into the endzone I remember one of his previous to remember he launched himself from about the 3 yard line whatever you gonna do it again for us on a Current Affair our misbehaving Polly's whiny little squirt turning our Parliament's into a rap there it is until tonight brings it back up to the 30yard line Kevin green what a character is the guy who was with the Rams and then the Steelers and then on to to the Panthers and this is what he does in his spare time Americans back at second Steve McMichael remember they former defensive tackle for the Chicago Bears Mongo he has to escape the Grande to recover I just I love spontaneous wrestling like that so fewer they froze and that's incomplete great fifty to go and before it I don't know what that was you know that was a let's get on the plane and go home to Denver and regroup and beat San Diego and see what hard all over again if the Broncos win next week they will host a wildcard game most likely against Jacksonville second down and ten by Rod Smith up at the 36 yard line and again a reminder that the team that has had the homefield advantage in the National Football Conference five out of the last six years has used that advantage and gone on and won the Super Bowl not just got to the Super Bowl they they won the Super Bowl four years in a row and five of the last six a men is undefeated here of being this year by sharpness outer bands or the Niners just keep rolling despite and we chronicled it tonight the problems with it DeBartolo being forced to resign his position but in effect Carmen policy has been running this team on a daily basis as the president of a CEO for for seven years in the 49ers and Steve Mariucci are convinced that this organization will not miss a beat along the way here all right Mike Clark is emerged as a reveal fine executive great receiver to Joe Montana persona New Year's that's incomplete another drop fest at Lake Clark and through the years John McVay was here and did a wonderful job and they know how to Scout and they know how to to draft and trade and work the salary can put people in the seats and take home Lombardi trophies and there might be a sixth one in the near future well winning was more important than money spending money at the bar below in the corridor second and time Plus chase just and as the Broncos lick their wounds and go home you have to wonder about Terrell Davis and will he play next week Tony Jones they're starting tackle is on the bench right now on the sidelines and they are icing his leg and Harry Swain is replacing him now some good news for Denver is that hopefully they're starting left guard marks Lara Wildeve starting to practice with the ball club maybe he'll be back there's harmed right there that he'll be back in time for the playoffs happy a hell bass is too high intended for rod strengthen its fourth down and for the 49er faithful a great night of victory for their team those kids will have something to talk about remember in the crowd that I had an excessive 68000 ten and that's almost picked off and almost picked off it would have been out of bounds anyway Darnell Walker with a coverage on McCaffrey well it has been a while since this Denver offense and John Elway in particular has had such a difficult time of doing much of anything mr. desperation to hell by John Elway there on fourth down but with the exception of another Kansas City game in the part of the 49ers this defense has been what has made this 49er team and has brought them to a it is now a 13 and 2 record if you're a 49er fan it just doesn't get any sweeter than tonight I mean how much sweeter can it be a clinch home field you finish the season unbeaten at home Jerry Rice comes back Jerry Rice scores a touchdown and the 49ers just dominate thanks for a touchdown they retired joe Montana's number as sweet as it gets in the end
