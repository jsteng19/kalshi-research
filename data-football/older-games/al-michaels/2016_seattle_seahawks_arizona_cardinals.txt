============================================================

let me see between one another right now those guys been playing great football since they've been together it's going to be a tough task woman but I think I'm more than ready prepared and we'll see how to outcome is Patrick thank you orbital and the Cardinals are without wide receiver John Brown whose sickle cell trait which is an inherited blood disorder is causing him hamstring pain as for the Seahawks there without linebacker Kevin Pierre Lewis and allpro safety Kam Chancellor will miss his second straight game with a groin injury Thank You Michelle that will make the Cardinals a happier group the standings this game so important now in the NFC west of Seattle wins they would have a two and a half game lead over Arizona if Arizona wins they're only a half game back the Rams lost today in London to the Giants 49ers lost to Tampa as you take a look at the standings and now Steven Hauschka will kick off for Seattle the Seahawks won the toss they have the third and Houska will send it down towards Britain golden and also JJ Nelson waiting in the end zone there he is the speedy one always a threat to go all the way Bruce Arians who's done a magnificent job here since taking over three years ago and off we go from Glendale Arizona on this Sunday night with a kick deep into the end zone Arizona we'll start from the 25yard line let's take a look at their starters carson palmer USC david johnson northern iowa night bashira University of Pittsburgh Michael Floyd Notre Dame ehrenfels UC Irvine Jermaine Gresham Oklahoma Jared valdaire Hillsdale College my coupon seat Idaho EQ Shipley Penn State or a Wofford James Madison loser Humphries University of Florida Humphries was their number one draft choice last david johnson lines up as the tailback here on the first place once Cummings from the 25yard line Carson Palmer at the helm and he gives it to Johnson Johnson an extra woman finds none smothered at the line of scrimmage second down last four games against Seattle tough sledding for Carson who sustained a concussion against the Rams in week 3 sent out the next game against San Francisco and then last week played against the Jets played well but had to come out of the game at the end of the game and it turns out to be a little bit of a hamstring tweak to all eyes on him tonight as he was somewhat limited in practice as Richard Sherman obviously keeping an eye on him all night long as we do in every Seahawk game and the pass is caught on a slant by Fitzgerald who takes it out to the 42 yard line 17 Larry Fitzgerald over the middle tackled there by Kelsey McRae playing in Chancellor's spot first down how did he get so wide open while they think there's going to come a screen and Fitzgerald it's just going to go right back inside and there was nobody there very cleverly drawn up that time by Bruce Arians and company up to the 42 yard line Varner is looking for that fast one Chris mentioned only seven points awesome it's jail but this time he is taken down immediately by KJ right sniffing that went out perfectly no gain second 210 yeah it's just so difficult on the outside when you've got these guys trying to get these blocks and then you've got one of the great inside linebackers KJ right to come out there and clean things up this is the defense they made some big mistakes in their game last week against the Atlanta Falcons don't expect a repeat of that here tonight almost all of them in the third quarter second to 10 to take the chaching Palmer escapes and thought that's going to be a first nap Jane Jane Nelson there's a flag down during the quali is the referee and he will give us his first call of the night a Nalgene man downfield that's number 76 now that's the left guard the veteran mic you potty no stranger to the Pro Bowl missed last week's game with an ankle injury you're just gonna see I think that they thought that was going to be a very quick pass at the outside and then when Carson Palmer had to pull it down his offensive lineman assumed it was out and went downfield and obviously too soon well they just changed the callers originally your potty and then Terry McCauley said it was offensive pass interference on Michael Floyd all right second down and 20 from the 32 yard line outside pick a little about 10 David Johnson makes the catch and let's take a look at that potent Seattle defense michael bennet Haley Taylor high school a table Reuben Iowa State's on them again Tennessee cliff April Boilermaker Cassius Marx UCLA Bobby Wagner the Utah State KJ right Mississippi State Richard Sherman Stanford Kelsey McCreary Arkansas State borough Thomas DBU Texas DeSean shed boiling stay a part of the legion of boom course it really pitch it down at ten now throws and that's part but short of the first down Floyd and he gets tackled in front of the Seattle bench but you can see where the marker is Floyd looking for the first down he's not going to get it he's almost two yards shy it's fourth down working against Jeremy Lane you're gonna see them just battle all the way down the field here is they're both pushing and shoving just a little bit the throw drew Michael Floyd back and just left him short I think that his timing of his route just got messed up because of all the contact and had no idea where he was it came up well short of the marker Brian quickly who was signed at the former jet the Arizona kicker it bounces at the 18yard line and takes a sideways huh he's down at about the 16 and that is where rusev and the co of offense will go to work when we come back Sunday Night Football brought to you by Chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you've got to get DIRECTV Bud Light beer with your team on it and by Farmers Insurance the calash montage of some of the Cardinals going all the way back to when they were in Chicago Michael Goodwill than some job with this team starting in Chicago then they went to st. Louis coming here they were the Phoenix Cardinals for a while and they decided to embrace the entire state when they came into this building 11 seasons ago no score siena running its first play now from the 17 yard line and Wilson starts with 5y under pressure Ziggler escape he has to sling it away the pressure put on by Kevin mentor the Cardinals love to blitz it'll be circa down to ten Russell Wilson he has just been phenomenal over the last 17 games going back to last year take a look at that last 12 regular season games 29 touchdowns only two interceptions top grading in the lead and even this year despite an ankle injury sustained in Week one and knee sprain in Week three he's not running as much but he's been very effective throwing the ball crystal Michael is the running back then he swings that one to the outside and that is caught there by thugs Walsman would have a third down and short as we take a look at the Seahawks starters Russell Wilson I'm a whole pack of bad news Chris and Michael take Susanna Doug Baldwin Stanford Jermaine Kearse University of Washington Tyler Lockett Kansas State Jimmy Graham the youth Bradley so Ole Miss mark Lewinsky West Virginia Justin Britt LHS my Z Jemaine of pity giggle Maggie's Garry Gilliam millionperson then a mixing and matching along thoughtless easily they're down this is going to keep it and this and not be able to turn the corner because Tony Jefferson the safety comes up to knock them down and it's a three and out just a brilliant play here they're going to do the read option and hope that Jefferson's going to jump on that is what Russell Wilson thought he was going to see but then Jefferson who's had a tremendous year so far comes out to make the play he gets his hand underneath you could call it sure close so they didn't have to punch and a booming kick and going up to his own 21 yard line had great coverage as well each team has had the ball once it's a 54yard booth no score don't miss a moment of tonight's game with the NBC Sports app watch the game anywhere live on your laptops tablet and connected TVs about that site Sun going down Camelback Mountain Scottsdale the Valley of the Sun when the Northwest portion of that valley out of Lindale Sunday Night Football and the Carden is habit that they are on 21 yard line Baumer under pressure throws and that will be incomplete it's the tight end Jermaine Gresham go to the field going to the grass they grow it outside and card it in at University of Phoenix Stadium it's second down and ten Jared Val deer is going to have the tough assignment over here going against Michael Bennett Michael Bennett will line up up and down that line just about everywhere and there's no question that Bruce Arians thinks that he is the most disruptive player along the defensive line in the National Football League so keeping up with Michael Bennett tonight is going to be job one for Arizona's offense second and ten time it's Johnson taking it for a gain of a Pemberly Johnson was picked in the third round played at Northern Iowa the school that also produced Kurt Warner was here tonight doing the game on on radio and he has ascendant it was Chris Johnson who came in last year and then David helped to spell him and then David took over toward the end of the year he's the fantasy football darling of the preseason and he's living up to all expectations and you see him flanked out here as a wide receiver he started in college as a wide receiver trained that and plays very much a fight one when he's blanked out thirty seven blitz coming Masha's in complete a little high off the fingertips of britain golden covered there by Earl Thomas and that's a three and out for Arizona Earl Thomas was simply sensational a week ago right there a guy that can play the middle of the field they play a lot of man coverage and you have to be able to go sideline to sideline there but a pure Intimidator inside when he drops down in coverage like that can pick up even the best of the mantoman on those wide receivers in the second punt a high and short kick fielded at the 40yard line fair catch made there by lock in Seattle of the board Russell Wilson almost getting better year by year fantastic start to his career fit the season take a look at that Otto Graham Sid Luckman norm grant Brockman three guys from the deep past there he is fourth highest yards per play in the history of the league almost half of his passes down field 21 yards more have been complete since the beginning of last season 16 touchdowns he's just been terrific the third most accurate guy of any pass is only behind tom brady and matthew stafford he wouldn't expect that out of a deep we receivers set to the light he comes over the middle and low at his home there Marcus goals and put the pressure on that time it'll be putting a lot of pressure on all night long number 44 probably the biggest difference in this Arizona Cardinal team this year has been to play at their outside pass rushers and Marcus golden with six sacks already sort of a James Harrison kind of build to his play and he has been sensational the other side Chandler Jones with four sacks and that bookend approach finally they have that sort of pure 34 looking defense to attack an offense from the forty only frame swings a pass side to the 45 goes Kristin Michael it'll be third down as we take a look at the Arizona defense frosty weather USC Corey Peters Kentucky come on in trouble you Chandler Jones Cherokee down lieutenant watch this day Kevin minute LSU Marcus golden Mizzou may after Patrick Peterson LSU Tony Jefferson Oklahoma Tyrann Mathieu LSU Marcus Cooper both Limpy big offseason acquisition is Chandler Jones looking over in a trade with the Patriots and we'll some things in the coccyx and stick them it is van that Marcus golden again put the heat on coming through the middle to pressure Wilson fourth down yeah and Nick van that a guy that they were excited about coming into this ballgame Luke Wilson was hurt a week ago hurt his knee and so van that a rookie was going to get his opportunity when quite hang onto the personal all right John Ryan descended that a Patrick Peterson with John Brown inactive tonight Peterson strange running back punts won't have an opportunity here BC calls for a fair catch at the 12 yard line so the game has begun each team punting twice no score in Glendale easy load here to Larry David reverb this Larry Fitzgerald number two ranked wide receiver David Johnson the second ranked running back in the league is Cheryl run blocking why that Larry elusive plays often in the slot these days David Johnson number one in missed tackles Irene Davidson did they mention my name Larry big big Jets fan he was here on Monday night to watch his team get down 28 to 3 but they make sure he's coming back to under eight minutes to play first quarter ball at the 13 yard line I'm exploring a whole is david johnson very close to a first down over left guard he goes he comes into the game averaging five yards per carry good double team over there on the lefthand side and david johnson kind of very patient it's one of the things he learned from the older Chris Johnson who's hurt now on this team he was always a sort of big powerful speedy guy but he got to the National Football League and he learned sometimes you have to slow down sometimes you have to allow that double team to take place in that time jarred balladeer Mike's body once they got up on the defensive tackle got some movement and then David Johnson got through their game nine second down for the 2yard line and some patients finds the open spot around the left side tackle by McCrae and it's a first down for the Cardinals now don't you get the feeling that this Arizona offense is shifting just a little bit you know so many of the big plays in the passing game and deep bombs and Bruce Arians loves throwing the ball down the field but it's quite possible now that their best players david johnson the running back and so you almost feel like that maybe if they could get to some play action passing establish the run that some of those big plays might come back definitely i mean they're they're running it more making fewer deep shots of this to this point decision and johnson finds no limits interesting krista the the the difference in these two teams arizona running it war not taking as many deep shots and seattle which used to be the running team of course Marshawn Lynch as retired is now throwing the ball more than they have in years we talked about Michael Bennett watch him come here off the edge and get DJ Humphries and just take him straight back Humphries has added an element with his athleticism and tackled that from time to time he can still get powered when somebody gets underneath his chin second and ten left side too close to the 34yard line and that's gonna make a third down and about three shed makes the tackle as kam chancellor and in the Cardinals are quite happy to see him in civvies missing his second game groin issue and the hope to have him back next week when they go to face the Saints in New Orleans was this custom MacRay taking his spot wait for three guys to play with the Chiefs third and three to the ground and making the catch histories Larry Fitzgerald as he has done so brilliantly knew exactly how much you need me for a first time and that moves the sticks just don't know if there's been a better catcher of the ball in the National Football League than this guy Chris Carter you think of Jerry Rice some of those kinds of guys but it's such a rarity I was watching tape the other day and he dropped a fairly simple ball and I just like to roll it back go is that Larry Fitzgerald on that play but the biggest difference with Larry's game now Bruce Arians told them hey I can get you a hundred passes a year but you got to come in here and block and more often than not he will be at the point of attack on one place and he is again here is caught here by Floyd Michael Floyd takes it out to the 50yard line they're trying to get him going drop some passes early on and then got him a touchdown throw last week against the Jets and picks up a first down here and that's probably one of the things that has been missing this year from the big play element because Michael Floyd in the past was one of those you know the 50/50 balls they call them where you go down the field and you've got a smaller corner on you and just throw the ball up in there and let him go up and get it and so far this year that really has an apple I strive at a quarter by either team 50 the best kind of the albergue bounds boy coming back to receive it incomplete and that will make it second down in 10 and Frank Clark number 55 came in and pounded Palmer he Carroll over on the sidelines of course had his hands full a week ago with that sort of sideline blow up with Richard Sherman there were some blown coverages some blown communications and it was interesting peat instead of going over and screaming and yelling he just sort of let them handle it then he goes saying I know who I had over there I know how those guys operated I mean they'd figure it out and he turns that into a positive it could be a good thing second and 10 Jansen about three it'll be third down back to last week's game against Atlanta in the coughed up a 14point lead couple of blown coverages of course she had Chancellor out yet gray in and his Chris Rashard who can be a little volatile himself the defensive coordinator and there they were and Chris Rashard I talked to him this week and he said yeah then there came the happy dance at the end where they all come back picking up Richard Sherman and bouncing but Christmas card said you know hey I've gotta examine what I do sometimes I get mad and I should let those guys breathe for a minute over there before I come after them 237 rusher paid on and he's gonna get sacked justice enveloped at his own 45 yard line Clark comes in April comes in as well half the defense fourth down maybe the best pass rusher is cliff a roll coming off the edge over here going to try and block him with a tight end good luck with that and then you've got Frank Clark the things how Arizona has gotten beat in the past out against this bunch is they get in those third and long situations there are times against Seattle's defense you have to just say the football we're not going to take a big chance and turn it over this is their third punt already and it bounced at the five and takes a great bounce for the Cardinals and they're going to pin them at the one as good as it gets for their new doctor quickly as usual an array of bigname stars dropping by tonight shows so Justin Timberlake he'll be there Steve Martin will be there as well can I choke any family or just a University of Phoenix stay Seattle pin to begin this time the litters from space Kristin Michael for no gain we second down and ten Bunji Gunther came in there Alan almost got a safety out of that one now is great penetration coming right there and this is a Seattle offensive line that is extremely young they have not played together much they have not spent much money offensive line and Center dressed in Brooklyn third different position in the last three years Wilson that out of the gun and throws and that's going Station and afford so Wilson you go back to week one that played Miami in Seattle and he sustained an ankle sprain and then a knee injury against the Rams in week 3 at CL wearing a brace and that's been limiting him at least in terms of his wanting the season he said he's felt better than he has in a while so he's gaining some confidence that clearly this is a different Russell Wilson 100 or 200 yards rushing at all so far this season third and six in the final minute of the opening quarter pressure put on Wilson just has to throw it away Wilkin Cardinals were coming in and up the punt from the end zone one of the marquee matchups on the outside Patrick Peterson in the Pro Bowl every year of his career matched up against Doug Baldwin who I thought had one of the really remarkable runs that I've ever seen for a wide receiver 11 touchdowns in his last six games of 2015 and tied for the league lead with 14 on the season that matchup will be fun to watch tonight marquee on both sides on here after from Ryan short kick and Peterson set up the cars with good field position at the 33 yard line as we go to Michelle well you mentioned the injuries to Russell Wilson week three in the win over San Francisco he sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee stabilizes the inner thigh bone to the upper shin bone and it is involved in every motion than me makes so change of direction throwing on the wrong those are both impacted and as you said that's on top of the right high ankle sprain II suffered the first week of the season out and Michelle he is not missed any action at all and that's a very good thing for Seattle because their backup quarterback is a rookie trevone Boykin that's it just kind of on lesson to be there every week and he has been only doesn't matter from the 33yard line twentynine seconds left in the quarter a shirt again doesn't do this often and slides to a stop after a nineyard games takes the ball to the 24 yard line and that will probably take us into the next quarter it was Michael Bennett and Watford roll Watford Rouge really a backup right guard took care of him on that one I think Bruce Arians is just now breathing after Carson Palmer took off running on that one with the bad hamstring into the first nil nil Sunday Night Football back after these messages aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by Geico down upon the Arizona State Fair those water slides service is a nice place to be at this time of year Steinke one degrees outside in Glendale Arizona temperatures that they got up almost to a triple figures very cool inside here all right the Green Bay Packers fans everywhere by icy house traveled pretty well as well the Seahawks come down here with maybe ten thousand or so fans from the Seattle region they're into saying we have to use the silent count sometimes in our own building they bring so many second and two to the outside to the 20yard lines you know it's an early season game but this is usually important especially in Arizona because they can pull through than a half game otherwise Seattle has a two and a half game lead and of course we know what that means Arizona had the bye last year went to the championship game in the NFC Seattle won a wild card game thanks to a Blair Walsh missed field goal and then they got beat the next week well and it's just a point of pride at this point as well because Seattle's been coming down here every year and just kicking the heck out of them Marian said I think they're sick of watching all the tape I put on because I've been forcefeeding it down their throats this week Johnson and he's gonna get corralled Zack at the 21 yard line by TJ Wright loss of one second down and 11 this KJ Wright is really something zero missed tackles on the season and we see him so many different times in coverage against tight ends in various parts of the field but he cleans up so many things David Johnson makes people miss all the time that KJ right just has a wonderful way of staying in front of people in making plays second and 11 this bit Johnson at to the left side empty the backfield Seahawks blitz that's incomplete Johnson looked around one of the flag doesn't get one Bobbi Wegner the line back through the coverage Aryans upset about that noncoal third and 11 now you've got this one's scary here right you got Bobby Wagner against the guy who effectively is a wide receiver who plays running back and really Carson Palmer has to give him a little better opportunity on that one I thought Johnson did a good job of leaving some field where he could fade to make that catch and just slightly overthrown but if you get that kind of a matchup expect Arian to come back to that one so the replay don't like it there get him 11 we're stepping up and complete ciothes putting on a lot of heat evil again it's fourth down and they'll try to take a three nothing lead with a cat and zero field goal here boy Andre Ellington was wide open on to play but it looked like somebody got a piece of carson palmer's hand there was a table there comes Ellington across the field watch this he was going to pick them but this first down there was nobody there so a 39 yard attempt now Chandler Catanzaro last time we were here on opening night bad snap Boston the potential victory they had a nice snap here wouldn't you know it another problem a flag down that's Bobby Wagner who comes in but you have a penalty marker can't touch anybody if you're going to jump over it's legal as long as you don't touch anybody and our in certain it's going to be on Seattle it was a fourth and 11 Wagner was not all sides on the play I didn't see him if he just touches the helmet or anything else at that Center which he did right there that little toe tap is gonna cost them at the official saw it and the left foot on the numbers of the snapper but it results in a long conversation before McAuley gives us the call right beside him you had a table Aruban holding down the guard there's no foul what a difference so they looked at the formation no foul no points still nothing nothing well Bruce Arians you can see what he's been doing for the whole commercial break on the sideline very upset about that call by the way that is not reviewable he wanted that play to be reviewed it's not reviewable that costs him a timeout as well timeout we're going to challenge flag men think Aryans is arguing that he hit the center when she did that plays not reviewable but there it's a foul if Wagner had gotten too close to the center there you can't cover the center clearly he touched him clearly that should have been a foul they missed that one and Wagner was not close enough to the center to be considered covering him up so no foul there either and then losing a timeout he's like piling on at that point we throw a flag and it can't be reviewed that cost you a timeout Kristin Michael carries for a gain of about three and Bruce Arians who has not had a whole lot of luck this year with the kicking game they worst missed the kick against the New England Patriots they had issues in the Buffalo game this has been a long year for their special teams in particular the field goal team at the 34 second down and seven Silva and nothing brawling in the second quarter his hands quickly for a first down to fall Richardson takes his first grab of the night with speedy one second round pick back in 2014 you see so many of those tries for that when it's at the end of the game you don't often see it in the middle of game do you and here he comes right up the middle and Wagner obviously one of the great athletes here's a guy that's in the top ten of run defense past defense everybody Luke Kuechly the only one that sort of matched him this season so far with everything that he's done at the 44yard line Willson to the outside and just delving into the rulebook a little further incidental contact is not necessarily a penalty that's in the book so that was either they missed it or was ruled incidental contact or accidental you tell me can you explain the difference to me between an incidental contact and contact I thought the rule was supposed to be about player safety because you don't want guys flipping over and doing all that sort of side you know I think if you wipe the guy out is what they're thinking about you tell them I gave you a water me too I'm like you always at 20 what's the difference whatever you want act whatever that's how I got whatever that's it let's drop the 50yard line right and out of the hands of Jimmy Graham coming back after he missed the last five games last year with a patellar tendon injury which resulted in an operation and took him quite a while to get back he didn't play at all in preseason and he wasn't much of a factor the first couple of games but his return and fetching a lot of balls the last three games or so in this offensive because of I've been he's clearly not any third and 10 from the 44 Seattle has only one first down and that's incomplete and a flag is thrown Richardson was an intended receiver Cooper only who was the pawn we're recovering on the play penalties on the guard below in ski and the the punting unit comes back in again for what will be the seventh putt of this contest yeah he was working over there against big coleus Campbell and just had to hold on we'll talk more about this offensive line for Seattle they have not invested a whole lot of money in it best they can hear tonight Ryan's punt written Gordon collection at the 11yard line and brings it back out to the 1911 in a hand to the hand nothing nothing chasing is the pressure to wit builds in Martinsville Virginia her Junior broadcast booth apart the race that's that Sunday I said Joey Logano was responding around with a win at Talladega to evade at the moment well there you go David Johnson went to Northern Iowa and so did the man on the right mr. Kurt Warner went to three Super Bowls one woman with the Rams power now the treats he's going to go keep that feel it take a shot and the pass is incomplete shed was back there with Thomas covering on the play pass intended for JJ Nelson's second down in ten yeah it's that DeSean sheds done a nice job over there you think about what it's like playing opposite Richard Sherman you're gonna see so many balls come down the field here's a guy that was on their practice squad he was a safety he's just sort of filled in on special teams whatever he could and they absolutely love the fact they think he's one of the hardest workers on their team maybe not the most talented guy in the world he's about 220 pounds huge foreigner back but he just keeps making praise over there opposite Richard Sherman don't know where they'd be without in this shoe to the outside and Johnson and he exploits that as he dances down the sideline for a good game tackled thereby KJ right for him that's a first down and for a gain of 15 David Johnson through six weeks 833 scrimmage yards most in the league and before this day is done he could wind up as the rushing leader first Cardinals player since back in the Chicago days John David crow the de League after week six and some of the changes up front with Earl Watford and DJ Humphries on that right side of line much more athletic than what they had in the past few years and it's really helped some of them stretch runs and further note that was their first year that he sent me a woman who seconded the crow to the 35 yard line gain of one here David Johnson David Johnson tonight has already carried the ball 10 times but they've limited him to 32 yards you know it's kind of fun talking to David Johnson about Bruce Arians Bruce Arians so hard but really hard on David Johnson I said give me some example that he said well I got named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week one time but he refused to give me a game ball I was missing blocks and had a couple blown assignments in rough finding out a game war last week against the Jets JJ notion on the end he's able to get out to the 40yard line Bobby Wagner making the tackle to be third down and four believe that Bobby Wagner you know they picked Russell Wilson we all know how that worked out in the third round tremendous choice won the job as a rookie and then Bobby Wagner was also picked in that same draft just ahead of Wilson when you talk about John Schneider hitting the the jackpot there it was it's one of those poor guys they pay a lot of defensive players big money and it's well deserved and we've seen the results four straight years a number one scorer gumpa fair to johnson and instead of a loss on the play and another punt cliff April came in and Palmer was able to get rid of the ball and put it into Johnson's stomach in the first half that's as good as it gets for Carson Palmer right there he is dead to rights cliff Averill had him throwing him to the ground and just flipped it out that looked almost like a Russell Wilson kind of a play and then David Johnson took over from there so this is a first KJ write down on the field down so an injury timeout still no score gang busters matchup on Sunday Night Football next week the Philadelphia Eagles the Dallas Cowboys Eagles Hampton Minnesota their first loss of the season today Cowboys with a PI their 5 and 1/2 goes for to Philly Dallas next Sunday night its first down flag is thrown the outside and that squad for what would be a 12 yard game and then another flag comes is it two fouls on the play Floyd makes the catch might be one on Floyd like he may have pushed off a bit at the top outside defense number 73 pass interference offense number 15 printed off strap that's michael bennet offside and there was a 12 yard game went away offsetting penalties here and he's no stranger to getting an offside call no he's not and Bruce Arians says guy lines up offsides all the time I said you're gonna mention that to the officials he said yeah before the game after the first play after the second play I'm just gonna talk about it all the time but he has been a nightmare and now that making bodies back here's andre ellington that gives david johnson a little bit of a rescuer on this series takes the ball into seattle territory to the 49 yard line russell wilson over on the sidelines you know it's been interesting to follow what's happened with him this year since spring that knee in his ankle obviously some things that he's always done moving around scrambling around and such has been limited a bit but I think he has just improved so much as a pocket passer you see him almost like a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning getting the ball out of his hands very quickly now not letting that pass rush get to him the time of possession but there has been only one scoring threat in the game and that was the field goal that was taken care of by Bobby Wagner and resulted in no points and that's nothing nothing halfway through the second quarter you don't get to be the number one scoring defense four years in a row and not be pretty good so far we have really seen nothing thrown the way of Richard Sherman and one deep shot down the field that JJ Nelson but not much has been there they can get this running game going play action might work backers but not thus far it's Sherman and he will shadow Floyd going to the other side but the play clock was running down and a timeout is called here as we go to Michelle well Darren fells was questionable with an ankle injury went back for xrays got the ankle spattered he's working on loosening that up to Ron Brown is questionable with a knee injury Patrick Peterson left the field for a little bit ran to the xray room and when I say ran I mean he sprinted but they had been looking at the left side of his lower back he is back now on the bench and appears to be ready to go yeah there he is Michelle and he's smiling as well he was Peterson he was exactly what happened to him he's on Baldwin their little twist maybe of the back at that point and you'll see him reach for that back here there he is it's the bend over Michelle said he Sprint's to the xray room and he's back on the bench and just trying to stay loose yeah he really does not particularly like covering smaller receivers like Duck Baldwin he would prefer the big guys on the outside because you have to cover so many more routes that plays into slot you put virtually up to cover every possible route that there is playing in there and it's tougher for a guy Peterson's pretty big guy third down and three Arizona sickness a first down get it to Seattle's one first down David Johnson makes the catch over the middle that takes the ball to the 42 yard line it's just so hard you get so much pressure coming from Michael Bennett he has so much quickness and speed and then all of a sudden he drops his head and puts his helmet right underneath your chin and you get thrown back into your own quarterback and I think Carson Palmer has learned over the years playing these guys you don't hold the football you don't give Michael Bennett that opportunity get away is Johnson the yardage in this game is about a four to one ratio at this point the Cardinals have gained 128 yards in Seattle has been limited to 30 yards there is a little element missing though when cam Chancellor's not in the game isn't there I mean here's a 240 pound safety we saw him essentially knock Mike you potty out when he pulled around the last time they played in Seattle but they bring him to every game because he's sort of the what they call him to bouncer over there anything gets going on the sideline it's up to cam chance it or take care of it perfect description and it's gonna set up a third down two or three johnson probing through the middle doing a good job on him tonight limiting him to about three yards per carry you can see my cue potty is just not right he's got that bad ankle he went out for a player so but this is one of the most powerful one blocking guards in the game and you can just see him hobbling around just a little bit here just feeling uncomfortable just have to keep an eye on him at the 34 thirtytwo Johnson and he will enough for the first down to the 31yard line he goes for 40 left in the half Pete Carroll the ebullient effusive one always hard to believe when you think about an oldest Coast in the league he's 65 you think back to he was an NFL coach back in 94 he coached the Jets for one year before going to New England and the u.s. seeing and a lot of success there obviously and then to Seattle in 2010 their practices in Seattle are more competitive than some games I've seen they go and practice and it shows out let's say they pick him up sometime and the pass is incomplete because the coverage is great Earl Thomas is back there covering David Johnson the intended receiver will be second down yeah Thomas says I don't think so you're gonna get a little wheel route coming right up the way here and Thomas just gonna go straight with him there aren't many safeties in this league that can intimidate that can cover and that can lead a defensive unit he's a guy that by his own admission doesn't say a whole lot but lets his play speak for him out on the field he has an intensity about him that is infectious with this defense they have several guys like that but certainly Earl Thomas one of the leaders back there on three there's our throws and it's tip right was there at the 21 and it'll be third down to ten good battle on the outside between these two soon to be legends Larry Fitzgerald and Richard Sherman and one of the things Sherman was telling us is that you know Larry's not quite as quick out of those brakes as he used to be and you can sit on him sometimes he noticed that Revis was sitting on a few of his routes and he thought he could get away with the same stuff third and ten at the 31 in field goal range that every kick for Arizona these days is an adventure whoops coming again Palmer Garlan that sermon is all over Fitzgerald's for just a short game fourth down and now that group will come in with Catanzaro and Brewer the snapper Quigley is the holder neither of those guys the snapper or the holder was with the team at the beginning of the year and here's Catanzaro and of course they'll keep an eye on mr. Wagner this time well the table at Rubin the last time took the guard and sort of pulled his shoulders down I can't imagine jennair he's been a trying though he's been at this time and a 46 yarder is good so finally some points it takes almost 27 minutes three nothing hours all right next week starts with Thursday Night Football per usual it's the Jacksonville Jaguars against the Tennessee Titans at about half past 8 on the NFL Network Arizona on this Sunday night they lead three nothing white in contrast to the last two times Seattle came in and they they blew him out early and two combined score of those games was 71 to 12 and it's a line drive kick that will be returnable from the oneyard line Tyler Lockett when an outstanding rookie season takes us to the 17 Justin Bethel makes the tackle there and this will take over we talked about the batchat between Patrick Peterson and Doug Baldwin and Peterson said that when you're covering a guy in the slot every route imaginable and every direction of a break imaginable is available to that wide receiver so far Doug Baldwin just one catch for nine yards so Peterson's been doing a nice job and that move off the line of scrimmage right there I think is the one that ended up hurting Patrick Peterson's back pump dealing with wit guys like Doug Baldwin play up the play so he reached through the back again here for an xray Michael taking it out to the 23 yard line Kristen Michael interesting story because here's the guy was a high draft choice played his first two years in Seattle he was backing up Marshawn Lynch's little immaturity came into play so they dealt him to Dallas and then Dallas let him go was on the Washington Redskin practice squad for a month and then last year when Lynch was hurt and Thomas Rawls was hurt they expect him back in a couple of weeks to go up Michael back and now he's been there he guys issues and he picks up a first down here after the 29 yard line and Russell Wilson knows how important he is to this team right now without Marshawn Lynch and Thomas Rawls and all the guys that they've had so he writes them a little inspirational note before they go into meetings at least once a week and trying to talk about how important it is to show up every day like it's the most important day of your life go to work and do some Michael started that was only the second Seattle first down that's incomplete pass is broken up ran the intended receiver Tony Jefferson covering on the play and that takes us to the twominute warning that much time left in the half 3nothing carnage for the halftime coming up the Eagles and the Vikings their first loss of the season if you haven't seen that AJ Green catch he'll enjoy that one it was a beauty Mike Tirico look ahead to the Jags and the Titans which is the Thursday night matchup James Boettcher is the defensive coordinator second year took that one Todd balls left here to become the head coach of the Jets and his Mirren has done a heck of a job tonight second out of 10 listen to the outside trying to stay with him and he does and that's a short game Seattle was just two first downs to this point in the game another third down play coming up right here they are old for four on their third down conversions and we're not seeing Russell Wilson scrambling escaping being the total nightmare that he's been against the Arizona Cardinals and some of their main coverage in the past he did try to run one there Tony Jefferson got him on that Wilson spreads amount orange Prosise into the back here living another which the name free because he flag down so what would be a first down one at the waitandsee Barton was indicated against Seattle and concurred by Karen to call me that's the right tackle Garry Gilliam all right right out there going against glaze Campbell on the outside and clearly this is a team that is sort of making do at the tackle position right now Bradley Hsiao on the left side and Garry Gilliam on the other side they've got some good young talent inside but more often than not they're having to help those tackles outside it's 1/3 and 15 bring receivers of a bunch to the left crowd roaring and under pressure again and closing at the feet of Jimmy Graham they're at a hard time connecting the night miss fourth and 15 Sandler Jones with the windmill at offseason acquisition from New England here we go on the other side against Sal here and I think this was one of the great acquisitions that Arizona came up with because when Chandler Jones got on the left side and Marcus going on the other side all of a sudden they had bookends and so they couldn't have an offense that would help one side or the other they had equal pressure coming off both sides and it just difference on this defense this would be John Ryan's of the game it's a good 150 yards brings it back to the 25 so a minute remaining in the half dispose of Greenup Sunday Night Football being brought to you by BMW we want to make one thing the ultimate driving machine by Verizon join the better network because better matters by Subway try the new thick cut autumn carved turkey sandwich by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance Arizona State Fair doing that 430 years from over a million distance over two and a half week period every fall so far this Seattle offense oh four five on third downs and Arizona four four nine that really the difference in the game and when Carson Palmer has 10 more yards rushing than Russell Wilson you know get a strange first half working so that last note more points than any team in the final two minutes of the half as far this season oneyard gain here Johnson taken out of bounds here Michael Floyd take a look at what happened to him so he's out for the moment and you know John Brown is not playing do Ron Brown was back in the locker room floyd reached for his hamstring so they have fitzgerald in the game this floyd on the bench and they're down to their one four and five receivers now with JJ Nelson now is the speed guy number 14 is the one guy that has the ability to strike quickly going to be four and five of course Fitz's number one second down and eight is almost picked and Thomas me thinks he had it he comes away there's a flag down to begin with here and far in the past folding because number 25 it's moved as to whether he got it or not that Sherman called for the penalty we saw his arm wrapped around the right shoulder let's see if well you tell me you know sometimes you know they're looking from a long way away I always think what's hard to tell is okay the arm is there is he really impeding the progress or is the arm just their official that time I thought the progress over the 32 yard line first down the left side but he closed that one out of bounds JJ Nelson have a step that time but he was already on the chalk as the ball came down second and ten now these receivers are doing a decent job giving Carson Palmer a little field remember David Johnson earlier and left some room on the outside and Carson missed that one and really JJ Nelson was open here and the ball just thrown off the field Baumer 12 was 21 the only so every little bit more than four yards to pass the only offensive numbers for sizing pretty terrible second okay preview sling the defender away is Jermaine Gresham picks up a first down stays inbounds picks up a few more yards and finally gets out of bounds with 104 pushed Jeremy Lane out of the action yeah this a little forearm shiver to the side there and get off on me and then runs up close to the first down but really all aggression was trying to do was just run out of bounds and stop the clock and Lane basically kept him from doing it and almost cost him two first down the third and one then the girl comes into the slot the first down is Johnson gets it up to the 43 yard line now is when you really have to pick up the pace though you can't fool around and obviously Seattle lie on top of the ball carrier and trying to lay it all that they can one time out for Arizona as close to a first down they want to conserve that time up and now they figure they can so Carson has to take it here with 31 seconds all of the passing tonight at least the successful passing has been underneath bomber 14 of 16 when he throws short and old for 7 between 11 yards and 100 and remember Bruce Arians lost the timeout trying to challenge that play were Bobby Wagner jumped over and you weren't allowed to challenge it and it cost them a timeout and it may come into play in a big way here it's second down and inches with the ball of the 47 yard line not busy throws and the basses incomplete so the coverage is outstanding you see three Seahawks around Gresham and the pressure was put on Palmer at a throw of his back foot third and inches they just keep putting so much pressure on you saw eight guys up around the line of scrimmage on that particular play they're just they're not going to allow Bruce Arians any cheap and easy completions to set up a field goal try here before the end of the half we're down on one now you need to at least convert here it just feels like that this is going to turn into a David Johnson kind of a game that he's the best receiver may be out there that Larry Fitzgerald and Bess Rahner they give it to him here and then spike it out of bounds is finding Moammar a guy who has barely been in the game second year guy out of Boston College and they let him loose then he picks up the first down the gain of 23 coming right down here and they brought some pressure Larry Fitzgerald drew the coverage off with him Seattle up there playing tight on that third down and one and they go for it third foul deer on the outside taking care of Michael Bennett who could get a little tired after all these pass rushes they bought the field a while this afternoon how is the first catch of his career he left the practice squad and weak for now and incomplete Nelson the intended receiver that Sherman with him step per step and you've got 17 seconds they are still playing Bobby Wagner on the outside against David Johnson oneonone they took a deep shot on that before but Wagner is playing a good 10 11 yards off in that type of defensive alignment they could just raise up and throw the ball to Johnson who's pretty darn good in the open field and still have time I think to get up and spike the ball thick field goal in the 25 on a second to 10 fourman rush and he tries to dump it out a dozen but now you have 22 pressure on the clock is running down they have no time they have no timeouts there was a defensive shot somebody came in with a floor arm and may have stopped this clock before the half ended otherwise there was no chance for the clock to be stopped so Palmer was under pressure just trying to dump it off what Watford was the only guy around it so he of course would be an intellectual receiver then you got the action after the play and the question is when they put any time back on the clock Jeremy Lane came in he's the guy who comes in with a late shot there he is as the clock was running down and of course you can see McCauley reaching for the flag so there's your penalty on that side it was very close to whether that clock ran out I'm sure that's what they're discussing if it's a defensive penalty because they will get that additional snap could be offsetting here there are two fouls after the play unsportsmanlike conduct on the offense will pull the player off the pas personal foul unnecessary roughness he fist number 20,000 Kirk after the play the clock ran out that's the end of the first half Wow so the Cardinals squander an opportunity to make it six nothing settle for a three nothing lead at the break coming up next is the Toyota halftime after these messages tonight's first half highlights are brought to you by Chevrolet the Cardinals take the video ready to meet the Seahawks on Sunday Night Football pressure put on and he's gonna get sacked you're gonna try and block him with a tight end good luck with that another problem we got a strange first half work Chevrolet the most awarded car company two years in a row there you go at the half so hockey score 3 nothing Arizona leading Seattle the buzz Russell Wilson it's only the second time in 70 career starts he's been held scoreless in the first half Carson Palmer tonight 15 of the 26 130 David Johnson leading the league in yards from scrimmage has 83 total there and week 17 last year it was 30 to 6 at the end of the first half Seattle and tonight it is 3 nothing Arizona Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya on Sunday night big big game as far as the standings are concerned in this division Arizona would be a half game out with a win or two and a half back with a loss Seattle gets the ball and start the second half and gonna run it out of the end walk it to the outside he finds its bumped out of bounds up at the 28 yard line and we go to my show well a laughter Seattle's defensive stand to end the first half I had trouble corralling Pete Carroll as he left the field he was sprinting around from defender to defender slapping their helmet saying that's what I'm talking about and here we go second half when he did slow down he told me we have to start over we got nothing going offensively it doesn't matter why we just have to start over you gotta love watching this guy here if he is loving his defense and what's not to love with those guys but offensively let's see if they can get something rolling here in the third quarter or they really miss a lot see it so much now without Marshawn Lynch wisten michael they're going to get Thomas Rawls back in a couple of weeks who started the year as the starter got Burton Michael's done a pretty decent job tonight he's only carried the ball five times now for totals 19 yards you know one guy that really has made a difference up front is Justin Brett a guy that has moved up and down that offensive line from tackle to guard now into Center and if there's been one bright spot up there it has clearly been him second down and six Michael setting up the third entreat you know Chris another really interesting thing is Arizona's had the ball over 22 minutes Seattle's had the ball about eight minutes in Seattle's last 10 regularseason games they have had the time of possession advantage then tonight way down complete reversal and I thought it looked like Seattle's defense was a little worn out there at the end of the half some of their best pass rushers you could tell they had been on the field for a long time so Seattle has to start converting some third downs just to give that defensive break they're all four five on third have only two first battles in the game mrs. fire number three and he finally connects the gram he's targeting him a couple of times tonight gets it into him here where he first down on a gain of 14 yeah really one of their core plays sending him down and then sending CJ Prosise outside and look at that shot there by DJ swear injure right at the bad knee of Jimmy Graham and he said it happened to him the first time against the Rams and sort of took his breath away and he got up from that and said well if I survived that I must be alright while the 49yard line man that's the catch flag on the play however thermoforming would give us the cool pass interference for 15 that is curse he pushed off before making the catch back to come working against Marcus Cooper up here there's always at the top of the round a little stuff but I don't know you know again it's easy to see the arms extended it's harder to see if it had an effect and you know these guys sometimes back judges are 25 30 yards away so they just got to do the best they can Seattle has not run a single play from Arizona Territory gonna keep this penetration has been 46 get stuff Michael does buy coleus Campbell doing yeomen work again tonight here in the league out of University of Miami Callay is Campbell and watch trying to get him cut off there's just no way Leia's Campbell is one of those guys when he walks out on the field and you get a look at him six eight and just a monster of a guy consistently gives them five plus sax every single year never got a lot of recognition finally started getting to some pro bowls people know what kind of player he is now you think you're the Phoenix Suns game appeal and another flag here and that's going to make it second 26 offensive coordinator for the Seahawks narrow bevel a lot of success of his run there but tonight can't get anything going pretty good Arizona defense they were sharp last week too though the jets out of the end zone just limited to three second twenty six little stream Michael defense very well banking through there is they own whose cannon to make the tackle after a short gain gain two to one of the magical parts of this defense and what they do is they play a defensive back guy that was a safety in college at linebacker day home Buchanan and when you watch this team they just look faster than other teams and it's because they have smaller quicker guys on the field and it's hard to know is the league really moving entirely in that direction where it's just all about speed and coverage guys third and 24 from the 35 yard line eight yards no problem there CJ Prosise tackled by DJ square injure fourth and 16 and another punt I swear injure gave him a little lift last week didn't he came in with some big hits an interception and it's allowed them to take Tyrann Mathieu and move him back to what he does best which is playing the slot where he has been one of the best in the National Football League his new Ryan sixth Bunny's averaging 48 yards could be golden back to get this one is gonna be well short of that average and goes out of bounds and they'll mark that outside the 20 official stops at the 24 yard line but the only 33 yards back in Arizona Michele Tafoya and I spoke with Bruce Arians in halftime asked how they might open up things offensively and he said if they'll get their hands off of us and stop holding us we'll be fine and he said the refs need to do a better job of getting their hands off of us he did acknowledge they did have some deep targets available and simply missed them by the way they'll be without wide receiver Jurong Brown he's been downgraded to ow ow all right Thank You Michelle we talked about John Brown he's out so you get two three guys are out in Carson Palmer playing with the short deck with Michael boy does comeback common gets rocked as he releases and that's cliff Abel spent a good portion of the first half in the Arizona backfield what else is new when you bring pressure in the middle it means sometimes that you have to block down and when you block down you're gonna end up with a guy like cliff April coming off the edge with absolutely nobody Jared Val dear just let him go and Carson Palmer had no idea there this is not a turnover secondly ten here goes Jennison and just a sheer will made of six one of the knocks on david johnson coming out of college we knew he could catch the football but people didn't think maybe he was tough enough to run between the tackles and he was sort of a former wide receiver but he has proven himself inside one of the most elusive backs in the game 25 missed tackles already this season and he is a big strong tough guy and clearly in my mind the difference in his first half he has been the biggest part of the offense really on either team behind the arch and scrimmage you go five wide here and he got action on the right side of the seattle defensive line that's Frank yep third and three in a first down that hurts moves it to the 36 yard line Seattle penalized five times 235 hours only one penalty tonight for ten yards there you go good veteran quarterback play there breathe his own 36 yard line with Tosh good show the age of 33 still doing it gain of eight so Fitzgerald what a career he's had little doubt he'll be on the steps of Canton someday the question is how much longer for for Larry he's got amused about maybe retiring he's 33 years old Bruce Arians told us the other day said he thinks he'll keep going as long as Palmer keeps going I should allow you to want to break in a rocky quarterback you wonder if they might be a package deal Carson Palmer Larry Fitzgerald adversary you know there's three been riding this train a while now second two is Johnson again showing a pace just trying to find enough room that he does and takes the ball in the midfield strike making shed with him first now that's what you love to see the kind of fight that's going to come with this here and then just keep spinning and come back inside and make sure he picked up that first down sheds know little guy about 220 pounds and David Johnson wasn't going to give up and this is that kind of game out I mean when you talked about it this is a really important game for these two teams they're half game back for two and a half back play action that buys time and then Johnson makes a catch and it's about eight more to his yards from scrimmage total taking the ball of the 43 yard line he is great picking up yardage after contact there's his wife Megan he got married in the off season and they've gonna have a baby very excited about nori and we're starting to see right now to that because of the work Megan's husband they are now getting some play action passing doing that this pass rush is slowing down second down and two from the 43 shut up bye shed flag is down and knocked back box tops seven minutes remaining in the third Cardinals are sure this is against Seattle the Seattle defense is reacting they're sure to after the play personal foul against our office depilatory that's Jeremy Lane again came and lead at the end of the first half and that puts them securely in field goal range as the ball goes down to the 28 yard line Jeremy Lane was hitting blocked here right there he got his hand up underneath the facemask and it was lame just before the half who almost got that pal as well so there's the shot and it's keeping this drive moving now trailing thin now in the backfield they give it to him and before he can take it away but on the flag before a tie then Jermaine Gresham time of possession of course one sided Arizona's had the ball twice as much and they've had about three times as much yardage and in terms of first downs at that one to this list Arizona has 15 and Seattle is 3 this is a Green Bay Packers Chicago Bears and the snow in the mud defensive work Woody Hayes and they said Beckwith yeah over the middle making the catch stickiness at the 26 yard line is Gresham tackle there by Reuben drop and they do a lot of this sort of zone blitz tough drop out one of the defensive lineman Reuben went right in there and for Doug Baldwin he has been in that position way too much tonight this offense just unable to convert on third down first Rashard knows his defense they're playing well but how long can they hold it together here last two defensive coordinators Gus Grantland Dave Quinn wound up with hook coaching job to Jacksonville in the Llano respectively he's it's time back at the 26yard line right is there making it a third and eight why are we so impressed with the tackling of the Seattle Seahawks there's a reason that they're ranked so high every single year they call it heart tackling where they've been trained in the offseason taking the ball getting in and once they grab and get wrapped up twisting so that that ball carrier starts worrying about his knees and ankles getting hurt and gets him to the ground quickly third and eight Arizona six out of eleven converting on third down Johnson but he's gonna probably be tackled a little short of it let's see where they spot it right makes the stop they're gonna spot it inches short no now McCall D comes in and he says first down and one of the other officials is hold on a second let's measure so Terry's coming and he staying moving the chains and then the other guy says wait a second hold on Johnson on the outside of the bunch and you're gonna see right there KJ right just coming in and make one of those hot tackles here get that knee on the ground I think he was short of it didn't you I did absolutely McCauley signaled first down there the elbows down and the baby before that first and time I was taken by Seattle to mull it over so they measured and well short of the first down half a yard certainly so recharge defense Ariane's making the call at least for the moment Ariane's is leaving his offensive group out on the field at the 18 yard line passing up for the moment anyway what would be a 36 yard attack so then they run the flier in the Australian hit them kwan/wong shot by the tight ends to that right side and they give it to Johnson and boy that's the hurry close and again doesn't look like he gained anything and if he didn't it's going to be Seattle's ball we DeLeon pile Johnson through the middle put it down at just about the same spot there's no gain and they turn it over to the Seahawks four and a half left in the third and remains three nothing set that at football being brought to you by Southwest yes to low fares with nothing to hide that strain sparing see by Toyota let's go places by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL and by nationwide nationwide is on your side it's Friday night Perry hi Steven by Gilbert the penalty for the first time is than those guys so the defense holds Arizona now goes to work from his own 18 get nothing going good three yards per play caught up at the 21yard line Jermaine Kearse makes the catch mean of a couple well they stopped him on fourth down thanks to their star players glyph April first then KJ right and then Michael Bennett's going to clean it up at the end April kind of shoots down in the gap and forces Johnson to stutter Jay Wright got a piece and then Michael Bennett dropped him to his knees four minutes left in the third so the 26 setting up a third and three for the Seahawks that defense has been on the fields so much tonight last thing they want to see here is a throwing it out I just can't remember a game in which I have not seen Russell Wilson scramble around and make it I can't remember one that I'll see going to go back to the knee of the egg whowho's it but you tell me six possessions six months we'll go 5 wide and Wilson fires over the meadow or Christ in and then the ball comes out at the end of the play and McCauley comes in there and it hasn't been a whistle until now here comes here comes lags all over the joint so there we go again wait Jefferson's walking away it's as if Arizona is going to be the guilty party here Laius Campbell knock down the pass and it went right back to Russell Wilson's arm who tried to run for the first down and then after that everything went berserk so Wilson winds up at the bottom of the pile all kinds of laundry being thrown and another conference here did the ball come loose and is that why everybody was scrambling and did that there's some files after the play a sports or like conduct office they were suddenly six coming off the pile I supposed to like knock 92 defense play off the pile the pool is all set at the dead wall spot fourth down I said Germain of Fetty the number one draft choice and frosti Rucker or the guys who get the penalties plays Campbell is going to come on this loop and knock the ball backwards and Russell Wilson is going to take it out of midair and then Marcus golden is going to make the tackle on it and then here we go and pulling people off the pile is a penalty I think for the first time this year that they've instituted that we seen it now three different times here what they want to do is keep all that junk from happening NEMA goes is a reception for Russell Wilson like Brett Favre's for silver for real Ryan's the golden gets taken down right there by Thor and back comes bomber you show the season on NBC we think you'll enjoy very much Chicago med then you configured this Thursday the medical drama coming your way Thursday night right here on the National Broadcasting Company mikey bonnie is back in he's been in and out there he is big enogh number 76 wall to 20yard line Jesse so Marcin Palmer is 14th year won the heisman trophy back in Oh and who was his coach Pete Carroll who was his teaming Chris Rashard the defensive coordinator so he knew that that Rashard would be a coach someday said he just had he had that aura about him and then of course we talked to Palmer about Pete Carroll and when when Pete came in actually it was Parsons junior year before he had taken over for by Tuesday 14 of about three so I love you know you get with Carson Palmer really bright guy 36 years old but in the legal long time what did he say in terms of what did Pete Carroll teach you don't give the defense too much credit they were walking off talking all this philosophy and all of a sudden Pete just stopped said hey don't give those guys that much credit now he's out here in a three nothing game and you got to give the defense a little bit of credit but it really was Pete Carroll who sort of changed the career path of Carson Palmer not very good at all his first year at USC which was his junior year comes back his senior year and Pete said forget all this strongarm stuff let's get the ball out of your hand let's get some completions going and end up winning the Heisman Trophy I mean when's the Heisman becomes the norm or know who will pick in the draft Johnson picks up a hardearned first down before he is driven back by Bobby Wagner so took him down to a minute to go in the third quarter Fitzgerald one of the great blockers but Bobby Wagner one of the great linebackers and just discarded the wide receiver here to make the play but not before he was able to pick up that first down and you know how this is just the difference in the game is that Johnson is able to finish these runs a little bit better and is converting a few first downs barely in this game but it is not much more than that this is just a slugfest of great defensive football Baumer dropping back in the corner and then over the Nelson and he gets taken down from behind of the 45 yard line by the Shawn shed otherwise he might have gone all away Dean 224 yards nice job here by JJ Nelson's squeeze and back out to the outside against shed and then using that speed to break across the middle I'll tell you when you see a 20 yard completion in this game it the place becomes electric there just hasn't been many of those the coverage has been good on the outside for sure into three three nothing Arizona aerial coverage that is being brought to you by Geico now Michaels with Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya mr. Fred Goodell the director to Wisconsin tonight football they're the standings against the animal comes in four and one having won three in a row Arizona three and three and again they're either a half game back or two and a half back or the Cardinals in the poor Seattle would have a commanding Lee next week's action first things first three nothing and the first time here five yards we've talked about Michael Bennett in all the different places he lines up and all the different things that he does but so far it has been several guys having a nice game a cue Shipley has done a good job against him the undersized guy in there playing center but no matter where he's lined up they have had plenty of bodies on him you have to wonder just how healthy is after getting that meat dinged up a week ago but he has not had the total impact that we've had seen him have on this offense multiple times before definitely second man is five from the 40 this is 20 second carry of the ninth and gets pushed all the way back and crowd wants a flag but there is none and Matt Bennett all the places he lines up Chris it's everywhere I mean there's no way to have a decent scouting report he does lineup a little bit more outside as a pass rusher but 13 times or so that he lines up at linebacker on the inside so a very difficult guy to try and scheme against but I think he's you know it's just been a tough night they've been on the field forever tonight and usually they're on and off the field very quickly that's what the first time sucks the stumbling stays on his feet and gets all the way to the 14 but a flag down flag is back at the 29 yard line line of scrimmage was the 37 holy that's Michael Floyd again I think he grabbed the outside of the Jersey and just as the play was beginning to break away take a look right there and then when Jeremy Lane started to break away you can see the the Jersey fully in hand and so that's usually a pretty good indicator when you see the defensive back do a pirouette and then on the inside you see larry fitzgerald cracking down on michael bennett so he's been hit by everybody on the field now so it was it was third down and two but now it's third and four he's that's a spot bowel comes back from where it occurred instead of a first down and a 14yard gain you back of the 39 but it's third down and four and jumping it is Earl Thomas to break it up and need him in off to the races and that was Jeremy Lane but the heat on me Palmer getting rid of the blow on a hurry so fourth down and they gonna bring in the punting group Earl Thomas came from about 12 yards deep that time and almost made this play he recognizes it right away knew exactly what it was and almost had a pick six right there so they're not going to fool around with a potential 57 yard Ryan Quigley sends it down to the 8 yard line by out of lie it there the penalty three nothing it remains coming up on the halfway mark of the season already the way Thursday night and if fell now we're gonna have it for you about half past eight Jacksonville against Tennessee 3a fewer points the first reporters Arizona at the Jets back in 2012 the remains 3nothing 13 minutes and regulation and as a sevenyard game here which is a big game these nights or these this particular night for Doug Baldwin run out by Cooper second down I tell you you have to appreciate what Arizona does with James better on the defensive side they've got him backed up and they're still bringing blitzes they're slanting the line they're bringing blitzes and linebackers and no fear I mean you could just see it there is no fear from James Boettcher and what he's gone it's a gain of nine second down and one the longest game that I see out of four and so first I'm here for Michael you know that one teams have the ball more than the other when you win the time a possession battle you clinch it before the end of the third quarter they hand it over 30 minutes in the first three quarters thirty to fifty right out of 1450 t.o.p so they're adore me now the frontdoor me it's good overtime under 12 to play is only the fourth first out of the night for the Seahawks Willson under pressure sliding away flag is thrown again as he swings that one Alliance Marcus golden number 44 putting the heat on Marcus golden spent a problem tonight always a good listener so McCauley looks over he wants to know where they're airing his once thing to play and he'll take the he'll take the 10 yards penalties on the left tackle Bradley salad yeah and one of the things they knew of course al was here in Arizona and they knew he was going to have a tough time trying to hold up against these bull rushes going right back into him and they thought that not only could they go through him but they could also squeeze the pocket in on Russell Wilson so basically he wouldn't be able to scramble around that happen in addition defensively they're also sort of taking one of their pass rushers and rushing them up the middle but not very hard to make sure that Russell Wilson doesn't get out and beat him with some runs burst in 20 from the 11yard and then deep downfield and Bormann cannot make a onehanded track so she's done many many times in the past home to Jefferson with the coverage second down to 20 well what Wilson has done as the dual threat as you can see I mean last year 553 yards the year before 849 when they go to the Super Bowl and lose of course the New England two in the end of the game this year just 33 yards so you know he contends that we say who blew the ankle and the knee and all of that but obviously it's a factor but the other thing is that they made CJ spiller receiving threat in order to play CJ Prosise but Bo sighs really so far hasn't been a factor second and 20 zoom in to the outside great ball loose and it's Michael who's their mentor made the tackle almost comes up with it and it's third and a mile upcoming that's was this ball out and was a knee down elbow down up good call you know you this is one of those circumstances third and a million you go okay you don't want to do anything crazy here clock is ticking down here so at some point you got to try bird and a quarter in the field 25 yards and Wilson is going to shovel it precise and he gets hit after a gain to the couple by who else DJ Swearengen no DJ swear injure was one of those guys early in his career was getting fined by the league office he like about every other week four hits to the helmet they brought him in here they thought he could be a really good player and they worked forever with him to get his head out of some of these tackles and now when he comes up and takes people on we've seen him put on some devastating but legal hits and past few weeks he mogul from the bucket he while I answered a busy night for almost a lot of bounds at the 48yard and stayed in so Arizona has it on the Seattle half of the field but by 3:00 Sunday Night Football being brought to you by the Ford fseries the official truck of the NFL by Kelowna extra inviting you to find your peach and buy GE the digital company that's also an industrial company Seahawks forty years in the National Football League and won that title with Wilson at the helm in the 13th season of course we were here for the New England game which came never so close she has to knock and Butler had other ideas so now you got Brock coil 52 is in there as where is on the sidelines and Fitzgerald and attention to the 44 and what about Wagner was movable Michelle well after the end of that last defensive series Wagner went to the locker room with cramps we've been told he has an IV and he's back out here didn't miss a snap although he is not on the field at the moment and there is Bobby coming back out here but just at this moment comes back out with nine and a half to go it is second down to five see that little cotton ball they're going to get blood us they put that little piece of cotton onion ivy ramp up again but he's a well that's knocked down at the line of scrimmage and we third down and five you know it almost is starting to feel now like if Arizona's offense can't get it going and Seattle's defense can't win the game you know they're gonna have to come up with a way and we saw hurled Thomas take a shot that's trying to go pick one up at some point when you begin to realize your offense can't do it defensively you take some chances and sometimes when that happens you give up big plays for touchdowns give it a homeless their average this year tonight we've had three points they will knock that last pass down third and five a little one slip pitch away and then Fitzgerald get some work before I ask possession that's incomplete and it's Sherman knocking it away little area shot fourth down yeah and what happens Carson Palmer drops the ball so he can't really tell what's gonna happen here there he is he's going to drop coverage and come back in and although stately Fitzgerald's head off there now quickly to punt bounces at the one and then slides into the endzone Sherman the hit of the night with 907 to go three nothing cards Wednesday night rivalry night National Hockey League action on NBCSN original six the Bruins they know Chara the Rangers Rangers beat the Coyotes earlier today at Madison Square Garden three two more scoring in that game than we've had tonight amazing really it's fun for me to watch a defensive fight like this that last part was only twenty four yards it's giving into the end zone it's a 1yard game here for Kristen Michaels stop by coleus Campbell second down well one of the things you have to do to Russell Wilson is you can't let them beat you outside the pocket so watch what they do they sort of build a little steel cage around him and make sure that he's not moving around too much and he can't step up and through the way that he has sometimes in the past second and nine and he tries to get it away the ball is loose and recovered back at the two yard line Chandler Jones came in created the fumble and knocks him all the way back inside the to tomahawk and I don't know if this is going to end up hurting Russell Wilson or not he's moving that shoulder around watch this tomahawk chop right down is that arm started to come forward and the issues with the tackles on the outside for the Seahawks is becoming a problem yeah that has to heard the torque there now you could see him he was rotating that shoulder after that play was over Marc Lewinsky the guard was able to recovered it stirred down a 29 and wasn't makes the catch up at the 13 but in comes Ryan for what will be his ninth punt of the night this offense is no slouch but I tell you what James Boettcher and his crew have done an unbelievable job look at this angle that's like a 45degree angle and that turn just so he can get that tomahawk chop down look at that just laying out around the corner used to see Robert Mathis and white Freeney remember those guys turning at that torqued angle like that coming around the edge select a cue ler play so a Mathis last week and then you've got Bradley salad the left tackle who gets the attention here it was seven and a half to go now in the fourth quarter meanwhile we're talking about better in his defense there they're trying to pitch their second touchdown shutout in the Roby's the Jets were limited to a field goal on Monday night and three points here another reason this game is so huge with the point out that if you look at the schedule of Arizona they have five of their last seven games on the road and six of their last nine felt like they gave away one early but this is yeah this is an offensive line just so you understand what's going on with Seattle they pay a lot of guys on the defensive side of the ball and they obviously play Russell Wilson and duck Ballwin and some guys but this offensive line is probably the least expensive offensive line in all of football right and here's Ryan's kick collection to 32 brings it back to the 39 7eleven good on the come out roll left to the for three nothing Arizona that's where we are this and that's the way we'll end October on Sunday night a beauty next week is those Cowboys Johnson now up to the 43 yard line on the first down Latynina for second down and six Johnson tonight 24 carries 84 yards and part of the reason that David Johnson has been able to do this Mike you potty jerod balladeer on the inside these guys watch this doubleteam coming in here against a tava Ruben who is a big guy I mean that is getting movement and then you could see KJ right the linebacker behind him he can't get through the mess so it doesn't look like much but four yards four yards four yards and you got the first down and that sort of been the formula for the Cardinals tonight six and a half to go second down and six as a first down taking it to the Seattle 47th but hold everything flag down 42 yard line pulling off 42nd are holding all on the tight end Gresham great jump cut that time by David Johnson but fresh them out here another one of those things you know you're you're thinking this runs going inside and all of a sudden you feel pressure Frank Clark trying to get to the outside and just end up grabbing them they've been consistent they've been calling this one all night and now you've got a one loose Ariane's is such an aggressive play and yet you're in one of those kind of games and your defense is doing so well boy that's a tough sighs here's your left tackle sow on the park Palmer who gets him bellick back of the 23 yard line cliff Averell spent a good part of this night in that Arizona backfield first guy in on the sack Lawson 9 we have two offensive linemen responsible for one guy and he still gets there that's pretty good nice move by Averell inside what a tremendous talent he has been number one since he came in the league with 24 sack fumbles and he has just been relentless tonight it's a half a sack third down and 25 Sanna may wind up with one decent field position for a changed Joshu Seattle has not had the ball tonight in Arizona territory not only didn't shut out the deepest penetration is their own 46 well when you make Bobby Wagner miss a tackle you know you've got some moves in the open field Johnson coming down here and here's Wagner to got him Square it up and just can't quite hang on to him but that was a big sort of 15 yard run just to give him a chance lying quickly so how the locket is back the flag is down the ball is picked up at the 31yard tackle is made there at the 27yard line Tanner McEvoy came in Marsh winds up with the football but it's all about the penalty now unbelievable your team has absolutely played their brains out and then you get a motion call here and essentially all you had to do probably for the rest of the game was plant the football as long as you don't lose the game on the offensive side or special teams you got to feel pretty good about what your defense is going to do and finally they probe Riley it was a special teams play it was great defense and finally the Arizona team finally gave him a chance and look at Pete Carroll McEvoy rookie from Wisconsin a free agent so she AnnaLynne far in territory on the Arizona half of the field four and a half ago he's a penalty I think McCauley said a penalty added to the end of the play he does that is a fiveyard penalty I get the call from the field in the second here it was at the 22 yard line so clearly within housekeys range they tacked on the illegal motion penalty is what they did George fan is now the left tackle and Wilson on playaction is gonna dump it off on the outside cook Baldwin and welcome to the moment we'll have picked up the first down however flag down back at the 33 holy Edison it was Brandon Williams number 86 glossing the first down and mixing the first in 20 there we go right there Tanner McEvoy he really is just gonna run right through the block Farren Williams yeah Rowan Williams just could not hold up the first out of 20 at the 32yard line the illegal motion penalty was on Pecola provo special finger and Wilson Claire first covered by Marcus Cooper second down and 20 you know it's just been that kind of game out here so far tonight you think about all the chances the Arizona Cardinals had they came down got a field goal when they were inside the 30yard line then a blocked field goal a sack at the end of the half and then lost it on down so they've had plenty of opportunities all those field goals that were missed or not tried now are coming into play missed opportunities so many games come down second e20 we'll see fires over the middle yardline then incomplete Doug Baldwin can't hold on hit by swear injure the third down and 20 where's our guy where's your right back here they're going to do a little end cut we're just going to come up and deliver the hit and that ball is out if they don't gain a yard here you're looking at 50 yard field goal attempt / attack with rice in the backyard well short of the first down that's McAvoy who blocked the kick so he's the big hero at the moment and now in comes Hauschka to attempt a field goal this has not been his favorite place he's made 12 of miss 7 in this stadium when 63% for a field goal kicker is bad this will be a 40yard attempt John Lyon holds will increase to snap it and we are knotted up at three so four minutes remaining in regulation sitting down the stretch in LenDale Arizona three three with NFL game pass you can replay the games you mess with condense games in 45 minutes for the full broadcast versions Suzanne offer nfl.com slant in mass check it out today University of Phoenix Stadium which has already hosted two Super Bowls and vocal classics home of the Cardinals and Arizona will take the ball after the touch back at the 25 oh so many games come down to special teams then this one might as well as Bobby Wagner heaping rocking the field goal attempt then you got McEvoy coming in here the penalty to boot on Arizona and a team that hadn't been passed its own 46 yard line is set up for the 40yard attempt by Hauschka who actually took a little bit of a divot sure he's where he knocked it down it's pretty good over the picturing lugs or in a wedge not necessarily good when you're a field goal kicker but he was able to bang it through Seahawk since 2010 them 18 block kicks after he Fitzgerald and the co2 getting forward progress through Jeremy lien with the coverage on the plague getting six yards on the gain it'll be second down and no about four yards maybe this is when you start getting a little squirrely as a play call or you come out here and you basically if you had punted the football you'd wonder if your defense would have just held up and won the game for you and now you've got to go back into the offensive mode but you know this defense kind of been kicking you a little bit too so you don't want to turn it over twice and lose the game based on their defense five as it turns out five and he gets taken down on a roll just having a fantastic night he's had a few in his career 8yard sack he has two and a half sacks tonight and it's third down at 13 just can't watch him use his hands here this guy is one of the best available and using his hands just gonna take Humphries hands and just SWAT him down as he comes around and somehow Carson Palmer held on to that ball I have no idea that was Roethlisberger asked holding on to that one but you can't lose the game by letting these guys come get you on the defensive side these are like sharks smelling blood 13:13 here they come on the Blitz and Palmer steps away from traffic deeds first down from Floyd up at the 38 yard line and thirteen on an end cut he picks up the first down Jeremy Lane on the Blitz almost gets the Palmer steps away and picks up 16 yards biggest block of the night right there by David Johnson comes across the formation gets just enough of Lane to allow Carson Palmer to get that ball off and pick up the first down each Sherman takes us to the twominute warning one three time outs of their disclosure three three on something to look coming up the Volkswagen postgame report Michelle as usual on the field with the stars of the game Mike and Mike and Tony we'll break it down and then we'll take a look ahead to next week's beauty in Arlington between the Eagles and the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football we are dropping Michael Bennett inside now is a pass rusher they're gonna try and win this game with a sack bump we'll watch this side over here a lot of the 38yard line Johnson get out of the backfield they're gonna stop him behind the one in a scrimmage lost of a couple Frank Clark with the tackle no time management now interesting on both sides both coaches probably want the clock to run a bit here but depending on the outcome of this play you may see one of the two sides taking a timeout give themselves a chance definitely this is the key right here on second and 12 Floyd makes the catch he's out of bounds that'll stop the clock so not necessary to take a timeout here either side shed covering on the play now you've got a third down and two at the 46 yard line now we're starting to see pending in April more and more stunts and games and loops and one of these two guys is going to come screaming after Carson Palmer here in a Bennett but you got to feel like maybe this is David Johnson time here third and two Fitzgerald comes into the slot it gets short of the first down so it's fourth down four and two and Carol now he'll take a timeout he's gonna wind up getting the ball back boy Earl Watford Allen that play completely missed watch this working against Michael Bennett biggest play of the night wiper goes right we'll never made contact Bennett didn't end up making the stop but it was his disruption of David Johnson that created that play for Bobby Wagner so Seattle's gonna have one timeout this is quickly sixth but it's the 15th punt of the game not surprising when we've got six total points from the game and that's MacAvoy right there what do you need what we've already seen what he can do hit a good putt here you can start using Arizona's timeouts to try and keep them back up now the good part again it's plotted the 22 lakh it did not call for the fair cats that's Bethel coming down and making the play on them so the ball is at the 22 we have 69 seconds one time out in Arizona has all of its timeouts Bethel was a great play by that that's a gutsy catch there with no fair catch by Tyler Lockett to get away with that one that could have been game over he loses control that ball there we go though Russell Wilson we've seen him in this Stadium and some clutch situations before we've seen both sides of that coin avidly all 223 lines up in the gun blank by working precise four man rush under Tom the cloth locket makes the catch second down gain of knives you know the one thing I never liked playing in a game like this is you know you sort of feel like okay we can give them a couple underneath throws but what that does for the offense is it gives you confidence and Russell Wilson they haven't had a great night on offense you give them a couple of completions and all of a sudden they start feeling it out there and it picks up momentum on their side Lockett was able to get out of bounds the clock with 103 all without move the right side is to go to Taiwan here they come and the pass is caught by curse and curses his own 40yard line up near midfield Jermaine Kearse you made a catch for the ages in that Super Bowl two years ago 17yard gain able to take advantage it was a big time blitz by Arizona but both inside linebackers had a free run CJ Prosise came over and gave Russell Wilson just enough time but here it is how they a little confidence now going on the offensive side when it matters both up at the 48yard pressure put on Wilson gets away flag is thrown and he just slings that ball and if with a mix of Corey Peters first through 13 accepted penalties in the game eight against Seattle Garry Gilliam the right tackle against owls out of the game so George fans playing the left tackle spot rookie out of Western Kentucky right here you're gonna see the reach and the crab just because he doesn't know Russell Wilson get ready to reach the scramble out just that little grab easy to see by the officials on the other side George man panting Jones Phaethon first and 20 back of the 38 the ocean the ball taken up to the 49 yard line another flag pose ice made the catch but barrels gonna watch the team polo go back even farther and that's fan you're a rookie at a Western Kentucky and you're looking right into the eyes and Chandler Jones good luck you're gonna get out here and then a loop back inside they call that a pick top because they're just going to pick the tackle and allow Chandler Jones to come back inside and Fant just grab them so this drive is there's more backwards offense in this game than forward offense up dives first and 30 41 seconds now if you're Arizona you hold of me start burning all new start burning your time man I don't know if they can block the goal passing keep it on the ground and that's nothing so it's going to be second and 30 that's precise and Arizona letting the clock one down really but yeah interested yeah but you know you stop it and then they complete a 40yard pass downfield thing you want to kill yourself I would rather take my chances with the timeout I think so to consent with it or at all three on the left tack it was second down and whatever thirty thousand feet or whatever yeah so I would have burned them all harrion's decides that he's going to take his chances next chance with the coin toss so it's the end of regulation might say regulation was underwhelming we know that at 33 there they are two to one ratio in both total yardage and time of possession I mean Arizona has to be sick looking at these numbers double double you know that's a game you win by 20 points rushing is the three and a half times as much wow I mean give credit to the Seattle defense it is so easy when you're playing on defense and your offense is doing nothing just sort of roll your eyes and not give up but you know more or less and get frustrated this defense kept hammering in the air ring and got it way this game is going there now maybe you kick off if you win the toss you single that time outs all replays will be alert the Calista score wins unless it's the team that has the most positions for the field all the important will have the opportunity what's our fault come on what could the rookie backup quarterback gets the call with heads so Arizona's going to get the ball you heard the rules suck Seattle wins the game field goal or something short of that extends the game over sound we go on Sunday night go to overtime again the standing Seattle is four and one they're looking for their fourth straight win Arizona three and three some huge game in the division as we conclude week 7 Houska to kickoff written golden and JJ Nelson for the Cardinals that will bounce through the enzymes so have the ball at the 25yard line but you know the reason I think I would have burned those timeouts is I think Pete Carroll would have been forced to run the ball twice he could not pass protect he couldn't take a chance on a sack fumble in that situation so you would have at least forced the punt there now it's cooked something crazy have happened of course but I really thought Pete Carroll and Darrell Bevell had gotten to the point where they said you know what we just can't take a risk here on dropping back here and losing our quarterback and maybe losing the game on a sack bump Magruder's go second in authority Ariane's decides to go for overtime wins the toss Johnson up to the 30yard line I mean it's such a weird game in so many ways we come out here tonight maybe it would be a defensive struggle but you're not thinking about three three no not between these two teams course their defenses are very good but you just wonder now this Seattle defense has been on the field for so long do you just turn around and keep giving at the David Johnson at this point and wonder can't we just are they finally to that point yet where maybe they're ready to give up some long run here so Johnson tonight as long as one is 14 yards but he's gained 101 28 carries leaving the lingam yards from scrimmage they thank it to him outside Snelson he spun away got a couple more yards and has it at the 50yard line tackle thereby shed they brought Larry Fitzgerald down in a blocking formation to make it look like run all the way and then Nelson speed on the outside he was left oneonone because Seattle is forced to come up and play the run against David Johnson so they go hard playaction he's one on one on the outside against maybe the fastest guy in the National Football League had to give him all that space right at the midfield strength nothing bosses the line of scrimmage or gets there Tony McDaniel right there for the tackle it'll be second down and ten take a look down the line here Michael Bennett that's Bruce Arians was all over the fact that he thinks Michael Bennett is also I've got everyone three receivers to the right side bomber looking the other traffic in that David Johnson is the intended receiver and right was there so third and 10 don't you just get the feeling that some defensive play is gonna win this game just the more you watch it it's like every time somebody throws the ball you kind of hold your breath but the played and Nelson was a huge play even if they have to punt the football because what it did was it brought it to midfield so now if you punt you have a chance to pin them back and really put pressure on Seattle's offense to have to play backed up which they engage all night long except the one time when I got the blocked kick and turned that into a field goal and now Seattle takes a timeout you only get two and over to Apple so they're down to their final one before the third down and ten you know Bruce Arians has the guts of a sailor right he's he's gonna throw it in any circumstance at any time anywhere that he's also seen what Michael Bennett and cliff April and some of those guys have been able to do to his outside protectors so for Palmer tonight to 38 Wilson has said very few days or nights like this one in his career on the ground Wilson's only carried the ball twice tonight 42 if I were to throw the ball here I would want this one out of my third and ten it is flowing for an 18yard gain to the 32 yard line so a huge stirred down conversion first down to the 32 straight zone defense and what a throw by Palmer here he's going to split the gap between the two underneath coverages that's not Sherman's responsibility and the guy that have been struggling to catch the ball this year Michael Floyd makes a great catch in a clutch situation pick up 5 hardearned yards he gets to the 27 he's closing in on the rushing lead right now Ezekiel Elliott of Dallas I believe would still be in front but not by much this is like a repeat of when we were here for the New England game right opening Nance to come down and win it with a field goal and Bruce Arians would rather try and score a touchdown then try another field goal oh yeah field goal extends the game Seattle would have one opportunity a touchdown and wins the game this was the case in the Green Bay playoff game we did last year and Arizona takes a timeout timeout Arizona so each team one timeout we're gonna see next Sunday night Philadelphia Dallas rookie as he killed elion lead in rushing you got the rookie dak Prescott who's the great Carson Wentz and the Eagles that Eagle defense today was tremendous as they knock dog Minnesota five and one with the cowboy sworn to of the Eagles got a few story lines and that went Washington losing today the Detroit and giant London beat the Rams so four and three everybody above 500 in the NF seized let your toxins pass rushers over there in Philadelphia gets maybe the best offensive line in football at the Dallas Cowboys there Johnson Rana 30 yards behind Elliott for the rushing lead in the try to win it in get up intended for Nelson and that shed coloring on the play going for the win and said it's third down and five what an unbelievable play by shed to not have a pass interference watch how patient he is he does not interfere with that play I thought for sure when that ball was underthrown that he was going to get pass interference and ball on the 1yard line that was tremendous I mean that was tremendous now Nelson could have jumped back through them and maybe drawn that flag but great patience thirtyfive brother twentyseven with protectionist eyebrows and it's not caught by Floyd he was there we would have had the first down instead he gonna bring in Catanzaro for an attempt of about 45 yards makes it great catch in his hands let this one hit him right in the shoulder pads there's nothing wrong with using your pads to help you make a catch but you've got to put your hands on it at the same time it hits your pads now we got to watch Bobby Wagner game will go on even with a field goal Catanzaro from 45 high drama again on a kick and this time the kick by Catanzaro is good so it is 6 to 3 in Seattle will now get one possession bring it a hand into overtime six three six to three Wilson the waiting his turn title lock it back to receive Seattle gets one possession they don't score it that's it you get a feel going we go on you get a touchdown they win the game that'll lock it Bob a little bit my injuries this season but he is explosive Catanzaro an opportunity to run it back so Wilson and company come out to the 25yard line there's Arizona's defense they're getting ready know one thing about overtime you look at the Seattle guys that D on the trampoline everything is poured down territory now so even if it's whatever it is fourth down you're going for it there's nothing to lose and that is the situation back up rookie left tackling the game George fan brookey right guard Jermaine a Fetty and defensively now your plan receivers because you are confident with Seattle's offensive line and they give it to Michael and Christine Michael takes it out to the 35 so a nice way to start comes off the backside Graham lays down a nice block and that's a gain of ten and a first down tight ends getting it done here Brandon Williams first block there and then Jimmy Graham's going to come around and clean up the backside of that with a nice it as well so feels good when you're struggling with pass protection to the 10yard run to start those yeah their longest rush of the night from the 35 by Jimmy Graham who had a changeup to him Jefferson makes the tackle and that's another first down I think this is one of the better throws that Wilson makes when he is on the move he has this innate ability to sort of lob throws out there I've seen him do that on multiple occasions even running directly towards the line of scrimmage and drop it in over the top of a defender not many people can do that perfect touch gain of 13 at the 48yard line stepping up fires over the middle and that's a gain of about seven that's gram again making the catch it's going to be second down and three Chandler Jones but the heat on but couldn't get to him very nice place to start this Drive now that the pressure is getting there almost instantaneously but now we've seen in the last couple of plays Russell Wilson bootleg out right now step up and through the pocket he's starting to give them in a little Russell Wilson move here and of eight second and two and going through the hole goes Michael taking the ball to the 38 yard line we're just about on the edge of field goal range here right there the doubleteam there is what set that one up the Augsburg in a perfect time full place for their quest drive of the night what adds confidence when you get that extra down on the 38 this is Graham some overtime period to the 23 yard line that's a gain of 15 not only did he do that he also helped them protection watch this knocked down Josh Mauro then go pick up the first down you know that's the reason you pay superstar players like that and it's really an effective thing to start working those quick throws over the middle now to Jimmy Graham who had kind of been lost in this game at the 24 the line of scrimmage Marcus golden so now you're in territory get the fourth I'm gonna hear a field over where that Marcus golden is just relentless a I'm really happy to see guys that work as hard as he does and practice every day all the extra stuff that he does they have such great respect for him now starting to get the results of the sacks that he deserves second and nine from the 23 whoa man watch that that was good again for yard line that's locket making the cash and that will make it third down and four well this is one of those times that ordinarily you'd say all right Russell Wilson on the edge of bootleg quarterback draw all the things that come into play and do they now or not I think Jimmy Graham is option one for being here he is going to be flanked out down here to the bottom right wide to the right bottom of the screen third down and Wilson in complete stopping was Graham Tony Jefferson was back there now it's fourth now so House good comes in to attempt a field goal and this would be about 36 yards I have no idea what Jimmy Graham did there you know he's like he did not anticipate that one at all last one he took a divot and still got it through not his favorite place to kick from 36 yards to keep the game going at each team with a field goal in the next score will win the game it is six six was 642 left in the overtime period so now we are in suddendeath overtime next score wins the game game can end in the wreck of the season in a tie very infrequently does that happen the last one was two years ago the Bengals and Carolina wound up in a 37 37 tie and there were a few players that didn't know that it could end in a tie now do you really want to call Donovan out on that no okay you just did he wasn't the only one correct Zoe wasn't admitted it now Scott to kick off he got written golden and JJ Nelson both back at the goal Hospice kick yards in taking the lead is Nelson and Palmer will get the ball at the 25 little recap of the game tonight all defense with David Johnson with a hundred and sixtyfour yards from scrimmage he already lit the lead in that department Russell Wilson he's had better nights with nice Drive their special teams of course you to block kicks for the Seahawks first one into their first score of the night Damon 36 yard field goal in overtime to extend the action run the 25 playaction 250 euro it's funny mama who made the first catch of his career in regulation and the old guys second year guy at a Boston College team of the practice one in week four 26 yard game you could see Michael Floyd at the top running the post route which drew Richard Sherman just enough out of that area to allow Carson Palmer to fire this one in there and it's not always big arm throwers are needed in the National Football League but that was one of those throws were lay it in there perfect we're getting to tease the play because bells we yard gain here for David Johnson to the 45 yard line where you can only imagine how exhausted this Seattle defense has to be I mean they have been out there a lifetime in this game and have not folded yet they just keep hanging in there and this is a defense that has a way of making plays in these moments to win football they've defended 84 plays and they've been on the field for over 40 minutes old Thomas Richard Sherman some of these guys have a knack second and seven Palmer great protect is incomplete intended for Fitzgerald everybody wants a flag everybody Rudy for the Cardinals of course but they're not going to get 1/3 down stars going at it right there I'm gonna push by Larry Fitzgerald ball overthrown no call that was the correct one so third and seven five receivers a bunch to the left three the pair to the right blitz coming karma hanging in fighters over the middle notion to the 5yard line Carson Palmer they almost got to him and Nelson takes the boiler first and goal 40 yards right ere is going to come up and run the end cut and it's Richard Sherman who just loses his footing and can't come back to make the tackle I'll tell you JJ Nelson has made some big plays in this game stepping up John Brown unable to go Michael Floyd missed the key pass and he's get some love on that sideline now so maybe you run a play or whatever where Palmer takes the ball or whatever hash mark Catanzaro feels more comfortable with he'll go wins the game and play clock was it one took on that one final time to get down there take a timeout when do you kick it right now you know ordinarily but Bruce Arians I mean how long did he talk with us about this yet what has happened to his bugle teams and and how it's hurt him this year and how they could be undefeated and all those sorts of things take a look at again at Nelson and Palmer almost getting sacked there's notion working on Sherman now the weird thing was Richard Sherman was all over that route he almost broke before Nelson did and just stumbled a bit and he is the famous dancer Druce then we saw him in Seattle last year when Ellington ran for a gamewinning touchdown with that fabled dance and now you line up at a first and goal from the fire the Johnson and he's gonna hate to the end zone but they're going to say he's just before he gets to the goal line not the pylon off its warring second down and goal the Earl Thomas came out of nowhere to push him out of bounds that's interesting he does extend that ball and never come right up to the line and they give it to Johnson Waggener stop snow at the half yard line one more look you can't challenge it's everything is reviewable in New York if they want to stop it but they didn't and now do you bring in the field I think you bring them in here I mean at this point assume that was that was close I think once that foot hit the pylon no but you know you just kinda you got a look at Bruce Arians how did you know he's watching this with half his eyes closed here and well that's why he has a new snapper the play clock is to zero so that's gonna cost them five for eight the way blendin offense fiveyard penalty they got it right here so he has a new snapper than a new holder who got Aaron Brewers snapping picked him up Ryan Quigley came in to punt is the holder so these are different guys than had the problems in the New England game on opening day in the Buffalo game Wagner right in the middle same thing he's going to be trying to jump over the top one of those guards need to reach up with their hands and make some contact with it it's no good how in a movie that's a reason and españa it has been a nightmare it has been a nightmare for this thing there comes Wagner right over the top and some pressure off the side was that Sherman coming around the edge he thinks he's won the game Oh yes Wow can't make this stuff up back her up over the top and he made contact again it must have been incidental so now the ball is at the 20yard line I just got it Kristen Michael picks up one Arizona doesn't have a timeout my understanding of the role which is clearly wrong is if you jump over and you make contact if you jump cleanly you're fine but they're got Earl Watford putting his arm up and making contact so maybe I don't know by the way if you're thinking Seattle can run or not and settle for the tie which would be so beneficial then there is a twominute warning in overtime they play this like a fourth quarter so the clock will stop second and nine it's made up at the 26yard line that's Doug Baldwin now you got a third down they can take it down to the twominute warning this Catanzaro does he get another opportunity down the line he said they stopped him here they're gonna get the ball back I'll tell you what a guy that is a big hero right now is Kelsey McRae he's the guy that chased from behind and got Nelson at the 5yard line there's something going on in the end zone at the Sherman had missed the tackle and the fact that there was no touchdown on the reach for the pylon and Earl Thomas has played so third down and four the Clark is going to stop at two minutes right there a two minute overtime warning not sure the players necessarily knew what the situation was here layin alive third and four we come back so two minutes Seattle would have a timeout Arizona does not go back to the Wagner play again and the missed field goal well by the time Watford reached his arm up that was Watford initiating the contact so he did not hit the center did not land on the center shirt allow Sherman laid out couldn't get to it third and four existing play call here incomplete pass news Arizona a lot of time after a fun Wilson my purse covered by Marcus Cooper on a third and four gutsy gutsy call because they brought all the pressure watch all this stuff coming in here and this offensive line all night long has been tough perfectly picked up that time get the oneonone on the outside against Cooper speaking the guy make some big plays in this place Jermaine Kearse it's made of Udo levy 31 yard gain Michael get them very close to field goal range before he is taken out of bounds clock stopped 147 gain of six this is a Pete Carroll kind of football game isn't it I bet you he said 50 times on that sideline tonight don't give up guys we're gonna make a play special teams defense somebody's going to make a play we're gonna win this game I promise you said they're going we're gonna win this game I promise you're gonna win it now they bring the rookie Alex Collins into the backfield on second down and four and they give it the columns it's a yard maybe a yard in advance so right now you are looking at about a 55 yard field goal attempt if they don't gain another yard Russel Wilson was telling us that sometimes he goes over the sidelines and the toughness of moments and he and Pete Carroll look at each other and go unloved this I love being in this situation can you believe we get to do this how much fun is this and here they are again and I'm a lot of fun right now on the Arizona bench it's third down and three at the 36 block one and down to a minute left in overtime sensation badge and hates the world inside the ten broke away from time Matthew and now we've got a first and goal and of course big news to be coming in Matthieu no question one of the better slot guys has been struggling with that knee injury clearly not himself just yet oh boy worse than gold Catanzaro opening night disaster the middle goes Kristen Michael this would be about as bad a loss as a team could suffer if your Arizona to have your defense play the way they played tonight and and to be in a chance to get a half game out instead of two and a half out and losing head to head and also before you hit me up right there you had that five yard delay of game penalty so now haschke comes in to try to win the game 28 yard attempt John Ryung into hole that is impossible I'm telling you there's something inside his brain about this building whoo oh my goodness gracious that could not have happened you know what maybe this is justice for all concern oh man I guess if a game deserves to wind up in a tie this is the one Brian push it down house Kurt just close it I'm just telling you and we've watched this al every kick that Hauschka is made tonight he has gone up and fooled around with the turf and felt uncomfortable I don't know if he stuck his foot in the ground that first field goal barely cleared he kind of chunked that one a little bit and maybe the happiest guy in the building right now Chandler Catanzaro oh my goodness and larry fitzgerald washington peterson watching ball at the 20yard line Sophia settle to the tie or do you air one out here and hope for a pass interference penalty that would extend the game you got three receivers and a bunch to the right be careful you don't get one picked off but all its Lyman back there examine attack where do you run the stampers play here here's Fitzgerald he gets out of bounds and he there's two seconds left on the clock so you're on a fivesecond play and he got one more opportunity defensive foul would extend the game even though they'd be no time just be careful with a guy like Larry Fitzgerald going down the field he can make it look like a pass interference when it's not a pass interference and a little acting on his part here don't be stunned you gutsy call by any official to call pass interference here who knows who knows does your alltime prevent defense threeman rush he's going to air one a bomb and incomplete Fitzgerald II intended man in the end zone and that's the way it will ends chip shot field goal attempts that could have won the game hon so these guys go 75 minutes neither sees the endzone that's going to make this whole race in the NFC and the NFC West in particular a little crazy when you throw that tie in that nobody figures you'll have so the Cardinals are three three and one and Seattle is 4 1 and 1 and 0 missing this one how skirmishing his it winds up 6 section OT we will have the Volkswagen postgame report
