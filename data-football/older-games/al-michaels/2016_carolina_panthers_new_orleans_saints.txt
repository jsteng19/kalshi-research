============================================================

buddy we had to come out here and be ready for a good division opponent the Saints quarterback Drew B is past for 465 yards the last time you two teams met so what does the defense need to change to limit him tonight you know I think for most we up and we have to go out and we have to execute you know we have to do a much better job of executing connect and tighter to receivers and really giving our D line the chance to get out to the quarterback and that's something we didn't do in the first game Thomas thanks so much and tonight Cam Newton gets back the guy he calls his hidden gem allpro senator Ryan Khalil returns after missing two games with a shoulder injury and punter Andy Lee is out for the season so Michael Filardi will putt in his first NFL game tonight he will also hold on kicks and the same secondary took a big hit starting quarterback Delvin Breaux is out he will be replaced by BWL all right Thank You Heather the two coaches Sean Payton Ron Rivera there are the standings Atlanta off this weekend six and for Tampa Bay four and five so the Saints will either be four and six or five and five Carolina trying to go to 4 and 6 Carl Edwards Jr of the World Series champion Chicago Cubs gets the pound the drunky pounded when she came in in the seventh and fantastic final game of the World Series Graham Cano will kick off New Orleans won the toss when you have that offense you don't have to defer you want the football and that's what they're gonna do and he'll be kicking off to Marcus Murphy into Tim Hightower very pleasant night here temperature is 63 degrees little wild fires in Western North Carolina Georgia part of Tennessee lot of smoke around the Charlotte area yesterday today fairly clear right now so 11 is underway and there's a lot of weak start we have a touchback let's take a look at the Saints offense drew Brees Purdue barking Rome Alabama's Brandon cooks Oregon State Michael Thomas V Ohio State will expand forth ball stage Coby Fleener Stanford University Andrews P Stanford senio kin lamented Washington knocks Unger Oregon Jerry Evans Bloomsburg University Zach Strief Northwestern that potent New Orleans offense year after year has been storing it for a long time great offense very leaky defense their first overall offensively in the league first with the pass and the first play of the game Brandon cooks can't handle it second down drew Brees just keeps on rolling 37 years old having another fantastic year 24 touchdowns two picks on his way to another certainly 4,000 maybe 5,000 yards season what else is new with this guy 16 here in the lead sign as a free agent from San Diego back in oh six and this time he hits books and stays inbounds and picks up a first down well much like in the first game they are going to try and take advantage of the secondary now this Carolina secondary is much improved over what drew Brees saw in that first one if they're young Whoopie starters out there at the quarterback position and really solidified the safety positions as well and their first run of the game little poll that closes quickly mark normal won the Heisman Trophy when he said Alabama let's take a look at the Panther defense Charles Johnson University of Georgia start off to the lake University Utah jaehwan short Purdue West Horton USC Jack Thompson Washington Luke Kuechly Boston College Thomas Davis joins James Bradbury Sanford performance beat Ohio State University Boston North Carolina Delaware Virginia front seven is great issue has been the secondary ending and Ingram gets stuffed at the line of scrimmage so they started with two passes into the two runs and it's third down and eight come in with a sixth offensive lineman but it doesn't bother Luke Kuechly he's just going to weave his way through the traffic here to make that play and set up a third down and long and now this much improved Carolina pass rush that has been really productive the last three games gets its first shot my third and they breeze trying to climb the pocket as he normally does but he can't the bull is that the ball is loose all the Panthers think they have it Charles Johnson got in there and doesn't have it the Panthers come up with the ball so big turnover early in the game each team telling us yesterday it's very important on the Thursday they get off to a good story barrio addison right around the edge here working against John Phillips and Mario Addison has simply been on fire here lately getting pressure on the quarterback and comes up with a huge play to start this one Addison and Johnson right there so the Panthers who let the league last year and turnover differential and found a problem in that area this year get a big turnover early in the game we talked about bulk team saying it's very important on the Thursday to start quickly because each of these teams obviously coming off three days rest we difficult losses yep so here goes new moon from the 32 of deceits running back as the venerable Jonathan Stewart Stewart has a little convoy out in front but can't get around the corner taken down by Bell as we take a look at the Panther offense Cam Newton war eagle Jonathan Stewart the University of Orcs Calvin bismuth deep flow to state a game junior DRS a universe Greg Olson the U at Dixon Oregon Ducks my Kramer's Oregon's say Andrew nor well the Ohio State Brian Khalil University of Southern California trade Sam Darren ragdolls high school and there goes Johnathan Stewart who picks up about nine yards and sets up a third down and one to doing his thing here since he was drafted number one back in o8 at Dixon's gonna come down you guys see good patience here on the part of Johnathan Stewart just waiting waiting and all of a sudden the whole popped out to that lefthand side and they really desperately need to get this running game going without Ryan Khalil in there the last couple of games they really have not looked like the Carolina Panthers we saw with that run to the Super Bowl season the numbers on offense average twelfth an unfenced welcome pointspergame 11th rushing and first down they hand it off this stewart screaming stewart picks up about nine here so you had the first down on the last play it's eight here and sets up a second down and short cam newton number one pick overall in the league back in 2011 twenty thousand passing yards over 3,000 rushing yards accomplished that last week against Kansas City and that loss here on Sunday first guy in history at that age to do it Ron Rivera let this team to the NFC Championship last year pretty much pull off what they did two years ago when they started three eight and one and got into the playoffs never give it to Ted Ginn on the inside handoff and he no is not scored a touchdown this season until now gets into the score Devgan got into the end zone ten times last season that's his initial foray in there this year and they cash in on the turnover so they use the exact same formation and use of boats backs going to the same side and it gave New Orleans a problem on the first one a pass let's see if he got in the end zone was that me down first that's going to be the question of course reviewed on a scoring plane need down not even close right so Ted Ginn still with a goose egg and the touchdown of the apartment after I'm sure they'll take a look at this bring it back but it will make it a first down and goal Pete Morelli says I got it going to the hood when it comes back into be first and goal with that question reviewing the play the runner was short of the goal line ball be placed at the oneyard first down offensive lines gonna go one way and everything else is gonna go the other way all you're really trying to do here is just make those linebackers who often read the flow of those offensive linemen together all what tobert in his fullback oh you almost bobbled the snap and the cross stuarti we rush through the middle you stopped at the line of scrimmage it'll be second down and goal you know I know there's probably a lot of young people in the crowd in that end zone hoping that Cam Newton quarterback sneaks this right do these pretty generous about going over and giving them the football so they usually come running down from everywhere whenever he's somewhere close to the goal line can't wait or we can roll out we'll take a look here Larry Tauber Stewart off play action yeah look out and he's gonna get sacked back at the 13 yard line Nate's new part comes in number 54 and all of a sudden you know how a third and go all the way back at the 13 yard line Chris got an extra offensive lineman over here and this is just gonna be one of those it looked like it was just gonna be wide open and that Dixon looked like he was gonna be wide open and then all of a sudden it wasn't wide open Snoop are coming in boy when cam turned around you could almost feel it couldn't ya we're both like look out this is gonna be a headon collision ball to his left and that was the end of that play third down and goal after eleven yards sack the shotgun Whitacre flanks him in the backfield and he fires over the middle like it's tip and it's incomplete so after the Turner wound it looked like they were going to lead seven to nothing they'll have to settle for a field goal attempt after the review of what is not a touchdown and this gets tipped here by Tyler Davison the tackle so they bobble the snap right on first down gets sacked on second down and a ball tipped on third down give the Saints a lot of credit here that was a huge stand after that turnover and there is the new holder you know kicks it through just like we ended the game Sunday night is a flag down on the play wrinkle on stand roughing the kicker number 22 that's Kenny Vaccaro and yeah I have the option of moving the one with the ones going for two yeah personal foul that's not running into the kicker that's a first down of all things a personal foul that gives them a first and gold to move the ball Battle of the six yard line Faro is going to go through and basically take out both legs Wow what a turn of events to make that kind of a stand in this big game for these two teams Sean Payton's going crazy but now you asked that defense after they're over there celebrating highfiving and getting a drink of water come back out here and do it again they do it again a defense that played they were on the field for 83 plays on Sunday against Denver this is the eighth play of the drive and Newton's going to bat again at the 14 yard line so twice now in the first six minutes of the game Krueger and Ellerbee converge on the sack I think this is a total option on the part of Cam Newton we saw him do it a week ago and ran for 19 yards they give him the ability if he feels it to keep that ball that was a straight dive you could tell even the left side of that offensive line wasn't expecting that bootleg he made that decision on his own a second ago has that one tipped and that's almost caught but dropped right there but mr. part of this drive at the New Orleans 32 this is going to be the tenth play of a drive last week it was unbelievably at the 20 play drive that ended the punt damn Jordan their best defensive player had no problem getting around Jonathan Stewart is not happy this has been a really strange sequence as an amine bobbles fumbles sacks everything in this sequence here saying if defensively the Saints come out of here with just the field goal they're going to be celebrating over there touchdown overturn third and goal leaving fires and throws that one out of the end zone intended for Olson so it took them 10 plays to go from the 32 to the 14 you know and I know they don't want to run Cam Newton they don't want to do all the things that put him in harm's way but when you're on the oneyard line and you've got the best rushing threat at the quarterback position perhaps ever some of the spectacular runs he's made down there it's always tempting for that to be one 32yard attempt the Lord he puts it down and you know you through as I quality though settling for three with eight have to go and legal there's no night football they brought to you by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% of the car insurance by Lexus see your Lexus Microsoft Circus the official tablet of the NFL and by Coors Light anthers the team that came into the league is an expansion team along with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 95 and the following year they made it all the way to the NFC Championship game there were one game from the Superbowl as where the Jaguars that season under Tom Coughlin Jerry looks good he does pick off the ability Marcus Murphy 20yard line well these two guys get together you can count on a lot of points is going to quarterback rivalries when Roma face is Eli Manning through the years that's fifty five points per game that great and of Brady Manning rivalry through so many years 58 but number one would be Brees and Newton that 58.4 I can tell you is that is overwhelming it's a great matchup now breeze those and that is caught and forward progress shouldn't it a first down and we'll where Brandon cooks who gets tackled by James Bradbury the rookie out of Sanford and when you talk about that quarterback matchup start with the New Orleans Saints and here's a team that's at a topten offense each of the last 10 years since we have seen this combination of group reason Sean Payton top ten and seven of those ten years absolutely the outside goes Mark Ingram the nice off to the races for a 14 yard gain that's the brace himself on the Microsoft Surface box over there being a 14 and a first down now some of these just basic inside zone play you see how many defenders Carolina has up in the box on this first down but good misdirection you'll always have out of New Orleans Carolina players and coaches we're talking about they always give you a little new wing time we get together off play action the protection expunged about the year and I'm great story in and of itself to the 49 to my town list about four years of football came up with Arizona played in the Super Bowl actually the Arizona Pittsburgh classic after the OAH season that knee surgery and that when he gets back they brought her back last year and Ingram that hurt that I shot early in the season and now he he sees about Albany 33% of the carries for New Orleans with England getting the rest by towel again and very close to a first down attack there by Coleman they're done a pretty nice job here on the edge with their tight ends you know this is a team in New Orleans that that does a great job you see them now and a lot of like too tight in and Bunch formations there's a lot of guys crowded around the quarterback in the line of scrimmage but from a receiver standpoint it gives you a lot of feel to work with three tidings the company diamond formation and a first name breeze checks you up again I shower nearly dropped it but hangs on and picks up about five Luke suit he makes the tackle it'll be second down let's call it for one of the things I love watching about Drew Brees is how quickly he goes through progressions he will look down the field not like it and immediately snap his head foot right there and just get the ball out of his hands you know there are when you watch him in pregame warmup he will do that he'll throw the ball here but then fake throw fake throw fake throw all the way through his progression so they are just top of mind at all times second and four to the outside you talk about Bryza I'm not sure I ever saw a guy check it down faster than he does yeah and it's really it's kind of remarkable right let's watch him in pregame warmup and see how he does that to get the ball out of his hand but then here he goes there is my second read ain't gonna come over and throw one more time and go yeah that's two that's three that's four okay and in his mind that is how fast it works when you talk to that guy or a you think he's gonna be running but he is he is just quickwitted and goes through things very quickly third John Coon takes you to the 34yard British bookmaker already came out with odds for 2020 in the presidential race and Tom Brady I saw is in there 100 to 1 I saw that that would be bad tell you these quarterbacks anymore they're almost held to the standard of the President of the United States when they say something off collar or something inappropriate it is really national news watch your Twitter okay he caught Michael there's a fencing coordinator the pass to the near side and that's John Phillips and makes the catch and he goes nowhere Thomas Davis you know we talked about Hightower coming back we look at Thomas Davis here's the guy he is no stranger to the surgery table remarket oh my goodness the fact that he came back from three knee surgeries we talked about that before but what he did in the Super Bowl to be ready to play in that game you take a look at his arm before that game and it was what two weeks to get ready for that it just a brave man let's put it that way he wasn't really one of my favorite players and still playing it oh really these two inside backers about as good as it gets easier year 12 come back across the flow here the high time and he's gonna get stopped at the 13 3 he broke his arm in the NFC Championship game and well that's what it looked like going into the Super Bowl I mean it really does I hate to even say this it looks a little like a football and to put that thing together and you cannot imagine now they had it wrapped up and ad imagine breaking your arm because laces up swinging out again this time it's wooded Sneed and Sneed Goodyear takes the ball of the 17 a guy who was actually with the Panthers on their practice spot a couple of years ago and he has really turned the corner in his career great job by Drew Brees here you're gonna bring up blitz and not have that safety ready to cover up there we go just raise up pick up a first down but you're right I will each needs one of those guys that I don't think many fans around the country may even know who he is they've got some good young receivers and puts in Thomas but I'll tell you there are a lot of third down conversions in big plays made by Willis need two and a half left on the corner my towel is the back this is the 11th of the saints drive and they're gonna hand it to cooks coming in the round stays inbounds picks up a couple be second down you know it's amazing to me now that we're seeing this diverse an offense on both sides really brand new plays that have come out which lets you know how high a priority divisional games are these were probably game plans that were put together the last couple of weeks on Fridays and Saturdays getting ready for this short week like three days rest room each team as we said at the top obviously each team feeling like just an excruciating defeat and Sunday second down and six and that is caught and you almost have the first time and cooks gets pushed all the way back so cooks was about a yard shy of the first when they caught it Shaq Thompson carouse them and they're gonna spot that one about two two yards shy of the first on third and two yeah he got down around that yellow marker and looked like he was gonna have it and then tried to make that move around was that Kuechly good luck there it was interesting to talk with Drew Brees about Luke Kuechly was and he said I go the line of scrimmage the last time we play he called out at least the third of our plays he knew her plays he said it's just remarkable spot to since best in the league thirdly short which is the case here Sneed flanks Breeze in the backfield and they will almost over here minutes drop it his drop Kirk Coleman hits Coby Fleener so they're gonna rule that Fleener had made the catch drops it and that's gonna set up a fourth down yeah he was very close to the first down I was a little surprised they didn't rule this incomplete that's the way a lot of these go but because of the fact that ball came out it dropped well behind how they give him a pretty good mark there where it ended up in mmhmm but I think he would have had the first down but because of the fumble and that's how it was ruled then they had to go where the recovery was so the ball for the moment is spotted at the 9 yard line and New Orleans wants a measurement they're short but Peyton wants to see just how far he has to go it's gonna be as you can see I think repair is considering challenging this if it the spa he could if if they lined up to go for it ok that's not even close alright that makes why they measured that you know usually the bank bank plays they're gonna call I was close so they'll try to tie the game on a field goal attempt here by well Lutz he is a rookie he's the youngest kicker in the league 22 years old play the Georgia State these plays are all exist 27yard attempt and he puts at 36 seconds remaining in the opening quarter on Thursday night 3 3 Jimmy Fallon later tonight on NBC Bank of America Stadium Charlotte man I think doing construction in this town you look at your window there's like there like five cranes within three blocks and not little buildings either no good good sign let's kicks off and that will skid into the end zone for a touchback 36 seconds to go in the quarter 33 in Charlotte this is a moment of this and every Thursday night football game with the NBC Sports app watch anywhere online on tablets connect the TV by the way that's not downtown Charlotte that is Uptown Charlotte as you know the clock from the 25yard line this Drive begins with moving the pocket under pressure again for word man has already been sacked twice nearly gets sacked again Darryl Tapp put the heat on second down clearly was the old tuck rule if you will tried to make a throw and it just fell out of his hand so there's no tuck rule but you know what I'm talking about especially if you live in Boston I've heard of it yeah second and ten inside handoff goes to Jonathan Stewart and his ninth year in the NFL lured onto the 31 yard line it'll be third down and four and it's really good to have Ryan Khalil back in there not only in the run game but in that protection scheme as well he makes all the calls a lot of times you'll see him turn around and talk to Cam Newton tell them what's going on and that's exactly the way cam wants it and that will take us to the end of the opening stanza into the first quarter with the score New Orleans three Carolina three there's gonna cook ball presented by Bud Light continues after these messages from your local station tonight's aerial coverage provided by Geico Charlotte NC Bank of America Stadium Al Michaels Chris Collinsworth Heather Cox game is time you start with a third and four from the Panther 31 the first time it's Kelvin Benjamin into Saints territory they convert third and four to Benjamin of a soul of last season after not entering 19 yards I'm gonna get the little double slant going right here he's just so big when he's going up against somebody in that man coverage situation cuz he just picked bodies guys no he got hurt on that he was his left arm hanging as he came to the sideline Newton actually escaped again he's under pressure one more time and just has to fling it away with a poly put the pressure on that time it'll be sucking down and ten let's take a look at what happened to Kelvin Benjamin every made the catch looks like he got undercut and then maybe landed on that shoulder arm was hanging as he came to the sideline so he is a big part of this offense two second to ten at the 50yard line let's take five is it one my is zero as they get it away and Jonathan Stewart gets taken down for a loss of two and a flag down relatively penaltyfree to this point Pete Morelli with the coal the illegal formation number six he was on the end of the line the penalty is declined third down Darryl Williams the tacko who did not report eligible thus a penalty declined and that's gonna make it to but when you've got your tackle on the line and your receiver off that is ineligible because essentially then you make Darryl Williams an eligible receiver and he obviously did report technicalities of play receiver you see an offensive lineman inside of you get on the ball you would know third down and 12 or cam caught him in a blitz here then they're coming again pressure up the middle and he throws and that is broken up intended for Funchess and broken up by King Crawley rookie out of Colorado then LLL be pressured Newton well you can't do it any better than that if you're Cam Newton you basically buster once you saw it you let your offensive line know exactly what it was and they still ended up getting pressured you know when they get those oneonone matchups at for me personally I think Ted Ginn is the guy a lot of times that is going to scare people deep and if you want to hit those comebacks we saw it a few times in the game a week ago might Palardy is the new punter this is the first time he has hunted in an NFL game and the left footed kicker gets off a wobbly kick but an effective kick that gets down inside the 10 yard line that but ideally when on injured reserve Thursday night football being presented by Bud Light here with your team on it there's three three told you about the shootout that we were expected either like how we do it soon the cow well you know you've got greatness on both sides of the ball I think it would be hard to argue that Luke Kuechly hasn't been one of the top three or four defensive players in the league and Drew Brees every year is trying to set new record and we'll go through a few of those that is some matchup inside playaction breeze flows underneath to Ingram and Mark Ingram should have a first down spot the ball up the 19 yard line Davis and it's complete in on the tackle now one of the things that Luke Kuechly is going to have to do when he drops back into pass coverage he's going to have somebody underneath him and he'll have somebody run behind him and so the key according to Kuechly is get back deep early because as time goes by Drew Brees starts to drop his eyes and look for those checked outs who will watch him play in that high low tonight one wanna check down to the nineties nine 64yard taken down as they serenade mr. Keatley this time Ingram was going high and then Luke Kuechly took them low it's amazing almost like a running back running through a hole on the other side just no way Joey Evans was gonna beat Luke Kuechly to that hole and we talked about a guy who loves playing it here at Carolina doesn't he said I have been here for a while now even with a rough season this year in a bad record I have never heard a single fan say anything negative about me or our team since I've been here first gonna pick out of Boston College five years ago when they serenade them as well as Luke the Coon gets tackled by Keatley it's third down and six I can remember some of our conversations with Aaron Rodgers about John Coon Aaron didn't he'd never wanted to believe the field and we're starting to see more and more the Drew Brees is feeling the same way here's a guy's good enough honor excellent past protector and can catch the football coming out the back here then you see the good bodyguard third and six and breeze fires deep downfield and too deep into traffic Bobby Flay knows there and lucky fleas all over the joint nothing guys in the backfield when they have the ball going all the way downfield 35 yards here watch this coverage down this is just oneonone and Coby Fleener is wiggling and twisting and Drew Brees was going to take a shot anyway and just try and drop that thing in the bucket but it would have taken an absolutely perfect throw one of the very best coverage linebackers maybe we've ever seen Thomas Morris head good punter third in the league in gross average Ginn collects it at the 28 yard line looking for room decent run back up to the 37 back to there by John Hill still 3 3 in shrug there's a night football being brought to you by Verizon joined the better network because better matters by mercedesbenz or nothing while USAA official very appreciation sponsor of the NFL and by Walmart celebrate the holidays with Walmart buy gifts groceries and check out South Point High School Rockville South Carolina David Clowney of the Houston Texas that's his alma mater for 9/11 this year we go back from the 38 now awfully slow star tonight picks you up here punchers have another chance to see the Saints defense here they are Cameron Jordan Cal Nick Fairley Barbara Tyler Davison Fresno State Paul Kruger the University of Utah Danilo lrb Richmond senior high school Craig Robertson night x/vw Webb the College of William and Mary Keany Baqarah Texas Jairus Byrd Oregon long Bell the Ohio State University sterling Warren SMU against that defense the pass is part of the 30yard line that's punches again grabs by him first now let's go to Heather now the Panthers are without wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin right now he's gone inside to the xray room now prior the head his Panthers head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion examined that AC joint on top of his left shoulder Panthers are calling Benjamin's return questionable Thank You Elliott Sonny I was hanging a bunch these figures to play a bigger role here and that pass is incomplete addiction the number to pay then behind Greg Olson drops on second down yeah you saw a couple of completions in there to Devin Funchess and they were kind of going after the backup cornerback BW Webb who's playing in there for Delvin Breaux and there's Dennis Allen the defensive coordinator he was hooked up this defense no question second and 10 especially of late and that's a screen that doesn't go anywhere he was Picaro on the safety blitz Knox came down so it's third and 10 you just have to always be prepared because Kenny Vaccaro plays so many different roles he's the SWAT cornerback that he hits a ton of bricks and tell you when you can't get a screen pass off you understand just how quickly that gets there but the speed of out of the secondary to get pressure can be a real difference back we're the Olsen is their leading receiver vision 50 caches hasn't caught wonderment as meaning the targeted third down and ten and there is another sack the knell Ellerbe is when where Raven comes in a mess the third time that Newton has gone to the grass tonight hello he's gonna come around the edge right here they're gonna try and block him with the back side running back and the back side tied in and neither one of them could get a clean shot on Ellerbe and that's we have seen really an improvement out of this pass rush 11 sacks in the first eight games in the season high six last week and some good pressure here tonight so fourth down and now another punt the new guy on the block Palardy can not be before going into and so I'm gonna have to go in the half thrill NASCAR champ future stars of the sport in the track on NBCSN then on Sunday Jimmie Johnson could win these NBC's look at the headquarters of national associations stock car auto racing I think that's what it stands for Rasta NASCAR the exciting weekend this weekend down in the Final Four on the track all right these steps away until complete duck if it's intercepted by Coleman at the 45 Golemon sets this offense up inside the Saints 35yard they just don't think I've ever seen a Paul get away from drew brees quite like this one he's just going to move around in the pocket here and do a nice job buying a little extra time but then when he stepped up he really got a pretty good platform to throw the pawn it just wobble on him and there was no problem at all for Kirk Coleman who wasn't even playing half the field he was deep centerfield that ball just floated you know you don't see that breeze last week had two interceptions on consecutive passes against Denver so Clemence Coleman had seven interceptions a year ago during the league 14 before that Philadelphia been around so doing yeomen work from the 34 yard line this is Stewart going next end of nowhere let me suck him down say this Craig Robertson who's taken over is the middle linebacker for the New Orleans Saints as a young man I haven't really been impressed with I mean he is he wasn't really supposed to be that guy Stephon Anthony was a firstround draft pick James Laurinaitis kick was brought in here to be the middle linebacker and I would say as they went into camp he was kind of an afterthought right now he leads this team in tackles and just keeps making plays in the one and pass game the former was on deserving than was released today and just really signed someplace else and finally that hit also his first catch of the night so Olson has started his career with the Chicago Bears and it's been four years there and then in a tremendous trade for these guys and a really terrible one for Chicago here stablish himself was one of the premier tight ends in the NFL I tell you the other thing about Greg Olson this year one of the better years he's had blocking that's always been the knock on him I was just have you seen where he runs four or five he splits out but this year blocking he's been doing pretty well they're done 1 and they're gonna take a 31 when we come back Thursday Night Football being presented by Bud Light Bud Light beer with your team so the timeout was just call third down and one for the Carolina Panthers now at the Saints 25yard line and dazed and I this would be a Cam Newton run not so sure and you know back to days of year we go you very close flag astronomy so you you got blonde we'll hit some after it was out of bounds and less moving slow and getting up and you know the can mistaken his watch this season even had a chat with Roger Goodell about it this time its bond bill bill trees goes out of bounds unnecessary roughness right here downtown what's happened if they hadn't called this one there would have been an investigation I'm gonna read this guy right here and once he crashes down inside there by Jonathan Stewart to pick it off but this is yards out of bounds they had to call that one he said 43 meant 48 Vaughn Bell and that lose the ball through the 14 that Benjamin is back at least on the sideline so if he can get back into the game the fake to Stewart I'm gonna give it the Stuart than a fake to again so I mentioned it just briefly but the hits on Cam Newton I mean he he got to the point he said it's not fun anymore a lot of those hits of course coming yeah he runs so so much he's so big and that precipitated a call between him and Roger Goodell and he was grateful to the Commissioner he said that he heard me out he asked me a lot of questions about not just that but other things and he appreciated the fact that that he took the call and got some answers and they got a call second and ten and that's incomplete at the goal line intended for function covered by BW web and they get through that so I said to them the other that we were meeting with camera sister had the call and he said goodbye so long you know one of the really fun things about the job that we have there are a lot of fun things but when you have when you get to watch these young men grow up you know we met with cam since he was a baby in this league and you can just see the maturity and the fact that he's the MVP and he understands his bigger place in this league if it was a fun conversation and fun right now B's Benjamin's back in the game for him he looks the other way throws and and that's going to be a first been gold as Olson makes the cash so they said three receivers to the left then it goes to Olson and his first down and goal going up against the corner back here sterling more but that's the kind of a killer but I guarantee a Cam Newton wears them out in the film room tomorrow for not scoring a touchdown here you are a tight end turn and score running back Johnathan Stewart picked up Kenny Vaccaro they brought another one of those slot blitzes off the edge that's one of the reason it's so hard to take Johnathan Stewart out of the lineup it's such a good blocking well they've been down here before and I failed to get into the end zone this time they give it to Stewart and Stewart single yet an alley short of the goal line so they had a first and goal early in the game and then white wound up settling for a field goal in our second down and goal with six minutes to the half take a look just how close Johnathan Stewart got to this goal line they did hold him out a mnemonic came up there to make the play ACA is automatic on the golden law here in the second go on this any guy Jim Stewart that's his fifth rushing touchdown of kids and pants take the lead watch this movement right here taken straight back Andrew Norwell Ryan Khalil Trey Turner you simply cannot do it any better than that you saw Stuart jump over the top he really did not have to that was a blow away block by those interior three 5:42 the ham the trainers right now look at him handle ten three Newton took another shot on the handoff here on the touchdown go back and take a peek at this perfectly legal if you're going to carry out the fake on a read option or a bootleg defensively you have the right to make that hit because you don't know if he has the football or not so there are some that I think Cam Newton has been a hundred percent right about that he should have been protected that wasn't one of them he goes over the pictures on the sideline me law it's ten to three with our first touchdown of the game two teams that scored 79 points total each of their last two meetings and that one has then dropped out of bounds by Marcus Murphy a horrible mistake by working at a Missouri he was their seventh round draft choice and he pins them why would you catch that anyway it was going to go out of bounds on its own you to gotten it out on the 40yard line matter of fact some teams you'll see them they'll run out of bounds and reach back in and catch it because that takes the ball out of bounds that hurts but Samaras cadet has done most of the kickoff returns Murphy has had five and that was his sixth and have Ruiz tries to get him out here Brandon cooks makes the catch and James Bradbury one of the two rookie corners with the tackle good games Bradbury back healthy again number 24 this is a completely new secondary than what drew Brees saw last time around when they were playing Zach Sanchez but to get Brad berry back and just get these two rookies on the field Darryl Worley course you all know about Josh Norman and he's playing for the Redskins we'll see him on Sunday night but they drafted three quarterbacks to try and make up and they're finally starting to play together and play well second down and five some shot tender Thomas Davis makes its actively third down and one making that Thomas Davis when he hits you I don't think I'd are even saw this one coming holy folks these two inside linebackers can really run and when they get there it's damage time the third and one connect force field position more like we were 13 1 degrees as it so they will force that fun Charles Johnson there and Starla tuolei going off the field celebrating fourth down one of the things that you know is that Drew Brees gets the ball out of his hands so quickly there are times you just can't get there you see him raised up to throw that ball quickly into flattened and he would have had this first down credit Charles Johnson for basically a turnover there Thomas Moore snap kick first putt was 50 yards when the shorter and his fair caught it's a 49yard line by 10 amperes ham it had been filled for ten to the half they leave by 7:00 Ron Rivera now in his sixth season as the Panthers head coach boy I tell you they've taken a rhyme on the loopdeloop here the past few years from week six in 2013 to week 2 2014 they were 13 and 1 and from the 3rd week and 14 to the 13th week they were 1 anymore then they went on summer roll from week 14 in 2014 through last year and one not three insects crazy and start from the 49 here it's the other way and then he finds Mike Tolbert the fullback who gets a first down at the 34 yard line before he is tackled you know you you look at Mike Tolbert and I would say he's a shade over 240 and yet he ends up being one of those guys that just finds his way into the passing game all the time ize has been such an effective player coming out of the back field for as long as he adds a little shame the English came here four years ago and Stuart Stewart's carried the ball but the games only touchdown but ten carries the nitrogen team yards 1.8 this running game just does not look the same Johnathan Stewart last year averaged 4.1 yards per carry down to 3.6 at about 900 yards rushing it's easy to go just we are 34 so far this year we've had some injuries the offensive line we'll talk about those but it has not been the same running game second the Nate Newton is going to go it's incomplete against beauty one ran out of room third down and eight Darryl Williams now playing the right tackle position and they're going to give him a little help on the outside they've been chipping with backs they've been helping with tight ends this time the guard Trey Turner comes over to help they move Mike Rimmer's over to the left tackle position after Michael Oher went out with a concussion and he's been out for a while since week with that concussion 17 that he does miss the blindside movie around his life and the pass is incomplete glory round and it dropped it and never bringing the know to try to tack on three very clever play here at the end of this thing watch the punchout going from behind and just pokin that ball out who was that I couldn't see the number on bail on bail yeah there you go the safety coming up there and making that play that rookie I tell you we talked about him all the time in the running game that he just made a big time playing the pass game 49 yard attempt for agonal again new holders Velarde great effectiveness go to the Hat 13 to 3 Panthers so seven to nine days next Thursday Thanksgiving tonight wrap up your day is the Pittsburgh Steelers hapless to take not coax teams right now in context of the Vega the problems in Pittsburgh obviously travel indeed to his back of usin that's the thanks give knocked off Green Bay right did I got their season back on track with that big win at Green Bay we go see them on Sunday night and that is going to be interesting to see what's happening with that team gave them a lot of points in Tennessee and it's the pretty hot Washington squad ball comes out to the 25 we go to Heather what guys tonight wellknown chef Emeril Lagasse who is also a huge Saints fan and is watching the game tweeted this this is how we do TNF at my house how when are you coming over for some gumbo go sings hey guys do you think we have enough time to get there postgame let me tell you something we weren't invited he's great that restaurant is fabulous it's fantastic we were in there one night and withdrawn Peyton's in there and he said you know he was living on the other side of the wall yeah he had a hit a condo he's moved since then I would weigh 400 pounds but I lived on the other side of that wall take out next door is pretty cool that's Michael Thomas picking up 16 up to the 41 the rookie out of Ohio State off to a great start this season except for last week seams possessions right there field goal on the the second Travis the only decent drive at hand tonight been a rough night so far for Drew Brees they had 465 yards passing last time against care no big place nothing but big plays the first game from the 41 and that is caught here by Coby Fleener but the Stanford with Andrew Luck elated Indianapolis and came over as a creation in a second to that just give you some idea drew brees over a hundred quarterback rating the last five games and leading the NFL with 332 passing yards per game it's what Shaun McDermott and this defense is working against twominute warning 13 to 3 right coming up as the Lexus halftime Bob Tony and Rodney breaking it all down for you Rich Eisen in the NFL Network who'd give their take on Tony Hall boy was that classy the statute Sam Mills these late linebacker playful both of these teams terrific man who died much too young now in 2nd and tuefel pick up the first down is released takes the ball through the 42 yard line blue breeze coming up to the line here seen several three timeouts very cautious approach defensively tonight not going to give up those big plays like they did last time Brees would dump it off and it's caught by anger of a mark to the 20yard line Michael Thomas the rookie wideout upspringing with a nice block all the way to the 20 game 22 watch we'll keep the run right down the middle of feel Tampa to defense which is great he's so good he can cover that tight in going but you lose that element of Luke Kuechly on the outside and then there's Michael Thomas on the outside with a good walk as well I think Drew Brees gets it now and we're starting to see that understanding yes he wants to go get those big shot plays but as long as they sort of play that shell coverage in the back and not really wanting to put rookies James Bradbury and Darryl Worley in a tough position and mantoman coverage against the speed to some of these wide outs they're just going to allow them to have those little check downs right now drew Brees taking advantage 15 of 19 for 130 yards the world below of his average yards per pass degree written s six and a half he's the kind of guy who from the 20 they action and he's going to go down who's has plenty of action to Mario Addison hey Juan short also goes there that's the second sack for him it's one of those trick protections here they're going to go here but the back is basically going to run into them and mean that cine Ocala meant a is going to and Charles Johnson really forced that action now six and a half sacks for Addison he's the team leader second and twenty select the screen here and this is Ingram than Ingram takes the ball all the way down to the 14 yard line clock still rolling Saints have two timeouts it'll be third down and four and now they will spend time out number two all right NFL shot calm you can get free shipping on the largest selection of NFL licensed products we visit NFL shop calm today that's the official store of the national football team back in the day you could count on Jimmy Graham and Darren Sproles when they got down here right remember all those who just worked in tandem and now a lot of these young receivers out here for Drew Brees and they spent a lot of their time just getting in sync just learning what they're gonna do and believe me the red zone is like a whole new game there's a football game between the 20s and once you get inside the 20 it's a whole new game so some big guys you know the Coby Fleener the world are the kind of guys that you start looking to hear skill and as the third and five no snap please benzine flag is thrown yes infant Steve couldn't handle it and think it was Coby Fleener moving just a little start the brainy to off there Luke Kuechly walked right up on him and almost made him flinch he just lost track of it a little bit you know Luke Kuechly knew exactly who was likely to get the ball there too and he Fleener just got lost tracklist snap count it was just a half account too soon makes it third down 10 from the 20 and repeat the new left tackle be under pressure here from REO Addison that's the one frees us to dump it Thomas Davis came in that's gonna make it fourth down and he got an Ingram who gets shaken up and it was Thomas Davis with the collision Thomas Davis on that man coverage and he just sniffed it out I'd say we haven't seen him with huge hits already in this game reason those the man he wants to go to is going to the grounds and they have a 38yard attempt by the looking mule Lutz and that kick is blocked they down the side decision good morning and once again the Shh a block a touchdown as was the case with the extra point there's a flag down the flag comes down on one back which would be under 44 that's bradbury that'll take the touchdown away but it gives him the ball and pretty close to the field goal range like 92 Vernon Butler right there is going to end up getting this hand on this football and I tell you for the New Orleans Saints they just have got to be incredulous a little shove there from Bradbury well behind the play completely unnecessary they drop that foul to place well back up field as you can see so they're gonna figure out where to spot it oh my goodness God hates that clean James Bradbury was a good 5 to 10 yards behind Luke Kuechly no way was he going to get caught and now they're going to spot the ball it's tilting they're still going down the field with it and New Orleans has seen enough of these tight shots on the boundary here this is just unbelievable they saw that last week get the white shoe on white so you couldn't tell if he stepped out of bounds or not yeah I mean Bradbury overall the guys you're gonna take out of the play the rookie kicker it's a good job by lunch even if he wasn't getting pushed to the ground at least give it the full Academy Award performance there but that is just never behind the you go last week the ones trying to take the lead in the final minute of the game it gets blocked Denver gets the two points Denver wins meanwhile the officials on this play and there was parks did he step in he's not he said that was the ruling on the field meanwhile the officials have been going up and down the field with the ball to see where they were gonna spot it and we had it back at the 40 then they headed to 2925 to see where the foul took place I really wants to get together with the guys to figure out where to put the Block in the back the third at the 30yard line that will be enforcing their case well responded to 40 yes so now we've been moving the ball up and down and then they're gonna go back to where we thought they had it but it because the fountain place at the 39 roughly put the ball 240 Rivera says didn't you see the replay he was beyond 40 that is a huge palette in a lot of ways not only took the six points off but now it may now take two three points off unless they can pick up about ten yards to have a legitimate shot here marijuana has two timeouts 23 next to the head Nutan stepping up in the pocket under pressure Chloe in complete again patted but he was out of bounds he was beyond the end zone so very close to another touchdown for again but it's simply second down to ten Wow what a catch I was starting to flinch looking at that looks pretty good doesn't it there's a ball roll out well everything gets reviewed left hooks down the wife of Michigan State not possession the crime is looking at and now Marelli's going to the hood because they're gonna stop this to take a look inside two minutes no challenges sometimes it's so good even the referees can't believe it yep I think that ball even got tipped a little bit so again has control all the way to the ground the question now is he clearly gets one foot in does the other foot the top of the other foot right line through the endzone it looks like it I don't think there's any question did you as long as that ball didn't bobble at all that is a spectacular play now I'll tell you one more thing when you're running at the goal post like that and you're not exactly sure where you are to hang in there and make that kind of catch was awesome what a play by tech get unofficially but officially he would be the first guy in the league at least to my knowledge or knowledge who had a touchdown taken away and a touchdown giving back to Rick Lee the left one no question and the right foot I think it's gonna be a TD cats as his first touchdown of the season he almost had it but it was negated by a penalty now he gets one that they roll incomplete and that cam is going to go over and present a souvenir good stuff yeah it's a lifetime memories of those kids you know Ted kin a season ago had ten touchdowns that's his first so one of many areas where this team is sort of not quite been what they were a season ago and they'll go get an early Christmas gift mr. big sixteen seconds left in the first half and Carolina trying to keep their season alive up to twenty two three there you go there's again here on the outside greg robertson the linebacker had to strand stay with maybe the fastest guy on the field you see the two safety split that's called a Tampa 2 defense Tony Dungy would know all about that one and four Cam Newton he saw that matchup and just launched this thing really well covered by Robertson but Jen was even better I'll tell you in the happiest guy in the building right now James Bradbury Ted Ginn and Cam Newton just bailed him out yep and the Panthers are gonna get the ball to start the second half as well for a middle linebacker can't do a lot better than what he did on that play I mean that was Craig Robertson flying down the field good coverage on the fastest guy on the Carolina offense and Brees will take it at the 25yard line see if he wants to take one deep shot to try to get in field goal range with 16 seconds to half time I'm not sure Drew Brees will get a deep shot the rest of this game because they've been playing conservatively anyway now you're going to take a lead into the second half and there's no way Carolina's going to get beaten deep I don't blink just a little kneel down here that will end the first half and you have that block kick it's miraculous Carolina had a 17point lead Sunday against Kansas City and wound up losing the game Sean Payton can only hope mr. grace 22/3 is our halftime number stay tuned for the Lexus halftime report highlights analysis one Moorhead on Thursday Night Football presented by make the lemon is the end of a season begins here in Charlotte North Carolina you beat Oh Bubba make you lose turns the painters the board he's gonna get sacked back at the 13 yard these puzzles complete duck addiction intercepted the second go on this any dogs in you simply can't any better than that and on we go to the second half in charlotte al michaels Cris Collinsworth man Heather Cox Thursday Night Football twenty two three the numbers for Brees so a lot of short stuff tonight 16 to 21 on 45 Cam Newton as well except for that last pass to teddy him the defense for the Panthers very good tonight obviously you're holding the woloson three points in 30 minutes second straight game that they haven't done that but last week of course a different story for Carolina at the end as Kansas City came from behind erase the 17 point deficit and just as excruciating was the loss sustained by New Orleans to Denver at the Dome third corner starts with a touchback let's take a look at Cam Newton and what he did in the first half early in that half he took a sack when he dropped back and did not step up into the pocket that was really on him but on the touchdown pass quite the opposite Cam Newton gets back here comes the pressure again no problem just step up launch it and there you go the difference maker in that first half Cam Newton for all his great skills is still learning a few of the tricks of the trade and that would made a difference well it was going to be 13 to 6 if the Saints had made a field goal and said it's 20 to 3 the block and subsequent touchdown now from the 25yard line first play of the half is a pass the gain of 8 to 10 in and we go to Heather the Panthers with the lead but head coach Ron Rivera said we must do a better job running the ball just 25 rushing yards in that first half now as for the Saint Sean Payton actually quite pleased with the defensive pressure they've been able to get on quarterback Cam Newton the big issue we must cut down on turnovers al now six turnovers in the last six quarters for the Saints right now though that's been a killer tonight Carolina turnover free second down to two now trucking ahead is gonna be a yard short Jonathan Stewart they've held him in check tonight there's the issue you're just talking about Heather running running the ball Stewart carried 11 times for 19 yards this Craig Robertson is a little bit Luke Kuechly Lane I mean he really has some athleticism reading that running game from the other side and he is just filling the gaps and making a lot of legs third and one even outside the pocket then a throw back and that's gonna be a first down as Greg Olson makes the grab always a dangerous thing to go back across the field but Olson gets free picks up the first down yeah and almost a whole lot more than that is he feetsies way over to the left side there and okay this is a big play by Bob Bell there wasn't a lot left on that side of the field you can see Greg Olson just getting lost in the mix in there and that's always defensive players heat definitely pulls into a gain of three the naysayer first man quick hatches tonight for Olson and 53 for the season at the 44 Kelvin Benjamin hurt his shoulder in the first amp was out for a series with me a series in half and now obviously back in grabs it here let's give a little tip of the calf to Greg Olson we talked about how much better he is he's going to be blocking the best defensive player for the Saints Cameron Jordan now is this perfect no but good enough for Cam Newton to escape outside make a big play beam of 19 Benjamins second catch of the night we can flush that it's his eyes downfield and just throws it into the bench second down to ten take one more look at cams and last completion here and he is really not shoulder square anything they fight each but just so physically talented able to make some plays like that a guy that there's not much he can do as you look at him now how in the pocket doesn't he look like he's standing up a little straighter he spent a lot of time watching the Tom Brady's and Aaron Rodgers of this league and he sees them just standing up so much taller and Ron Rivera is a little worried that maybe that's the reason he's getting some of the hits to the legs we have the 65 245pound Newton and well yeah oh there's your shoes he is the fashion plate oh my goodness how about some of his that just what he came into our meeting with record I thought he'd just dressed up like that for press conferences but he always has the Hat the matching hat and the perfectly colorcoordinated city wakes up and the night before he actually lays his clothes out his dad taught him to do that he said I'm not much of a morning person I'm a little groggy don't talk much of it just gets up and gets dressed like a fireman I guess blam dude the outfits that he has worn especially his postgame press conferences he loves hats gonna the guy out Southern California the Venice district of La who makes hats for me what was the word autonomy the winner belladonna shake him down and mrs. Stewart his nicest one of the night yeah Newton came in yesterday and we talked about the word milliner I get mill under his hat maker mainly women so you know cam he meet Lainey he's he loves to learn he have his phone out he's put it down he wrote it down and then of all crazy stuff he can't make this up Lou came in for a tryout yesterday D millander after practice at the former Jets defensive back they tried him out at the defensive back everybody thought he was bringing a 31 punch straight ahead and it'll be a first down it was fun now he was in a good mood and you know everybody was talking about that at practice you saw a little bit of that bouncing around and playfulness and that is sort of the trademark of this team but they were working to you know this wasn't like a week off they were out there practicing the day before the game which not many teams do see that before with frequencies snack recovery series here to the left side Stewart tries to give squirt down to the 29 Stewart well that was a nice finish to that run there by Jonathan Stewart I think looked like it was going nowhere fast and ends up picking up four or five yards out of it he is just a big man you lose track of that sometimes he's standing beside Cam Newton and Mike Tolbert you go he probably weighs 215 220 about 245 pounds out there this may be the most impressive team in the league coming off the buzzer he's both impressive offense checking in five from the 29 yard line one Cameron Jordan the minute Stuart gotten the ball he is right there exactly four losses five yards on the read option you're not going to block the end guy in the line of scrimmage in that time it ended up being Cameron Jordan who just got there before they could hit this mesh point here that is what they were supposed to do Greg Olson was not supposed to block him they read him and I guess cam will probably tell you he should have fooled that ball out running himself and written the son of Steve and fires it's caught as ocean to the 22 yard line so they converted on the third and long to move the sticks what a goodlooking route that was by Craig Olson looked like it was going to be one of those deep overs and then he just put on the brakes and Danny Vacarro just kept going so big big play there by Olson just aren't many tight ends and League to run for five and have that kind of great creativity and route running opening drive of the second half this is the 11th fake the Stuart and the pass is incomplete at the 10yard line Devin Funchess covered by sterling war second and ten for the Panthers now they go unbalanced line to the left to make you think they're gonna run the football that way and then to go with that quick playaction fake here's the extra offensive lineman over here and this is when cam in this offense really at their best quick play fakes get the ball out quickly find that first read and that's what the Saints were trying to take away trust rate again and escapes and just has to throw it away at that point this Jordan put the pressure on I am pursuing camp third down now when you bring up pressure on everybody it puts a lot of pressure on the toughest matchup of your line and that being Cameron Jordan going against Darryl Williams Williams is a guy and looks like cam may have hurt his finger something if he was he's clutching his hand did he hit it on the helmet of cam Jordan he comes back to the huddle he was clutching his hand so the play clock is ticking down he needs some extra time even get my third down and ten nothing Ted King and take a small loss tacky thereby Sterling's or and that'll make it fourth down and incomes Kanoa again was it I think it's his left hand round he's grabbing right there named was able to get the next playoff and now you know for a 42yard attempt mic filartiga it is good to tack more 817 left in the third it's 23 for Carolyn Thursday night football being brought to you by Papa John's if this will beat the sponsor of the NFL by the new Volkswagen knob all track soon to be everywhere by Bo's get closer and buy well the Saints win in Super Bowl 44 over the course they're doing 17 a lot of futility frustration obviously four years in the Big Easy and then Jim Mora came along and very successfully brought that franchise into a new light so Jim tonight part of the New Orleans broadcast that's great that's true senior under the head coach at UCLA and Sean Payton has recently become the winningest coach in Saints history in outside here get a flag show you have a touch back for the moment you have an offside coming I tell you that was the most stunning play I think I've ever seen in a Super Bowl that onside kick or actually I didn't see I was at the concession stand outside number 30 of the kicking team number 10 of the kicking team 5 yards will be added to the end of the touch that spot ball B place at 30 yard line first down their timeout did we get the trip close to the 30 back after this NFL Thursday Night Football being presented by Bud Light here with your team on it big banking center Charlotte men should be for a lot of construction going on downtown great time to be a contractor in this area Greg Olson going over the pictures penalty head moved the ball to the 30 yard line that's where a breeze the company home without a touchdown tonight begin this dry and on the ground to go nowhere at defense Mark Ingram took it and was just pushed back from the outset Lawson I tell you this Charles Johnson's having a night tonight who's right around blocker looked like Tim lalito right there to make that play but you know we talked about in the opening on camera if this defense gets back to what they were a season ago we just don't know this team has gone on great runs in the past but this is this is a vital game for them tonight that are they gonna get a flag his breeze went down Charles Johnson knocked him down roughing the passer number 95 the others somewhere Cam Newton's rolling his eyes right now because that's eleven roughing the passer is now on drew brees didn't write none for Cam Newton since last year and we'll detail it as we go as we go along it that's the 11th time that Drew Brees has received a roughing the passer book Cam Newton zero now twice they called roughing newton but they were offset both times by penalties and Mark England tries to exploit that fortyfour and Ingram is slow in getting up hit there by Kirk Coleman so they work on him injury timeout so you're ready for that other football Saturday morning 6:30 Eastern man united against Arsenal Saturday to alter Eastern you've got the Spurs in west hand on NBC and NBCSN Rebecca Lowell gets me pretty good ha she's great at the 44yard line drew brees in the pocket and the past total complete Ingram was able to walk off under his own power Josh only intended receiver and there is mark on the effects for Coleman with the shot at the top of that helmet remember he took that big hit from Thomas Davis earlier in a rough night for the former Heisman Trophy winner Saints two and a half quarters without a touchdown that is manned by explored kind of news as cuts after a very short game weekly with the tackle well there goes Kingsley right here you think he can run one tackle James Bradbury mr. tackling you've got books out there who could absolutely fly but token number 59 I have a third down come into the backfield and throws and Smith tan mat well he does for the moment and let's see me they get a more good market to the 39 he got up and went forward but Leonard Johnson got him to the ground five yards short of the first time its fourth and five take a look nothing yet there's a knee clear and a forearm yep if you go here don't let you have to you're down by 20 you got six minutes to go you have to well don't forget last time they tried to sneak somebody into flat I think it was Charles Johnson who got his hands up and knocked kind of a quick throw don't see the pic plays against this team play clock at 1:00 Brees gets it off and then throws and they do get the first down as cooks needed five and got six you know this is this is just a mistake by a young player out here I mean you've gotten to what trooper he's gonna do right you got to pick up this first down on fourth down there's just no reason I guess there was a guy that ran the corner in behind him maybe that's what he saw but I think everybody in the building kind of knew where that ball was going and we were obviously with a first down marker is first down now give it the Hightower with on the bench in my tower for regard bb2 breeze lux is spreaded around and again tonight that is the case cooks his court seven to lead the team and he said eight different guys it has just been no big place not even more inclined to be safe checking the name scream pick up another first down a muchneeded one spot the ball just sign 2:23 you know we're finally starting to see a little offense out of the Saints it's amazing that this team that is essentially number one and has been for a long time but offense is struggling this much with Hightower right there to stop up the highpowered Saints they're averaging only four point six yards per play and they try all kinds of different things to get at Luke Kuechly and they just cannot get it done that time they brought the tight in around the top Josh Hill to try and make a block and Kuechly just tossed them aside and made another play Marcus Murphy that comes in hearing about his errand it makes the cashier and is forced out of bounds it was about a third down third and four now you got a guy like Brandon cooks out there here's a guy it's had two of the three longest plays in the National Football League ninetyeight yarder hits the Raiders an 87 yarder against the Panthers basically neutralized because in the style of play that Carolina's playing and elite holding into less than seven yards per reception third down they give it the cooks coming around the corner and let's see where they spot this obviously see where the marker is where the yellow line is ball just inside the 13 yard line Morelli comes over to make sure they have it right on the line meanwhile you've got winter Johnson who gets shaken up on the play that's Johnson who was down Leonard Johnson just made a spectacular play and it's not a good sign for New Orleans his Ingram goes back to the locker room miss Leonard Johnson just now walking off the field we're gonna get a challenge here because while we were away they willed this a first down you see the marker there you see the knee going down he's short course Rivera and his coaching staff they see the same thing and if he challenges here and they won the challenge to report out so Rivera with a challenge which we think he will win was down at the 13 yard line which is short of the line the game fourth down bankers won the challenge so now it's going to be fourth down pretty clear here even though the official sticks are on the other side I mean they almost matched perfectly but close enough you can see short of the 13 he needed to get past the 13 so it's fourth and inches now 26 on see made a great play his fourth Galligan the price and Ingram's already gone back a lot important issues breeze will keep it himself and breeds to lean forward going between the center of the guard and appears to have it the who knows what he was stutter stepping in there trying to find a spot well bring the chain gang out that was the the 12th play of this Drive you just kind of hesitated and then Starla Tula lay I think so it was that finally got him this will be very very close so the sticks are out there they're gonna put it down first out first down by a link may be excruciating so far in this game you know a lot closer than that if it matches up with that stick it is a first down tie goes to the runner so first now now they picked up five on this drive and the motors handed off the jongkul and he will go nowhere check in with Heather you guys saw Saints running back Mark Ingram getting escorted off the field he was visibly frustrated he is now in the locker room being evaluated for concussion and the Saints are light at running back out Daniel ASCO and charts cadet are out leaving just Tim Hightower and Marcus Murphy at the position right now exactly at a high tower they get the brunt of the ball carrying Murphy is secondyear dive messed up on that kickoff before and breeze gets taken down and gets tripped up by Kony Ealy who had a game for the ages in the Superbowl against Denver third down he sure did and here is Kony Ealy he is not the star turbinate comes in on those pass rush situations under speed has taken over for Terron Armstead the really great tackles in this league and just beat him inside for a huge sack and we just have heard nothing tonight from Michael Oh young receiver one pass to Hightower Hightower take him down if it's go we are in line so they're gonna wind up about nine yards shy of the first down on fourth down you just can't block Kuechly that's the problem when he starts to move there'll be somebody come out right there on him Kelly mente and he's like just dismisses them yeah it's not even like he's trying he just sort of dismisses them and goes up and makes the play well they're gonna line up for the field goal which you know we can you can certainly question here it's still gonna be a threepossession game if he makes it but we're gonna go to the end of the quarter to begin with so that is surprising to me with 15 minutes to play in regulation I think you go for it we'll see when we come back and the three aerial coverage tonight being provided by Geico as we look at Uptown Charlotte with Carol Cris Collinsworth I see start the fourth quarter and they're going to the field goal unit and there's a will Lutz attempting a field two ways to look at this goal snappish I'm horse that gets at them but they're still down by three possessions granted it's a fourth and nine but you still need three scores in the game in which you have six points in 45 minutes and four seconds nobody's got that warned over there and if I told him something like these two guys have been telling them all night don't try and score in our Stadium Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis all night long have just been waiting through this offensive line and making play after play at delivering big hit after big hit it's not news breaking that this is happening this has been probably the best pair of linebackers in the National Football League now for several years so but they have started to deliver and as the offense gets a little better and the defense gets a lot better here over the past couple of weeks is it possible this team that lost only one game in the regular season until its Super Bowl and could make a run yeah it's possible well they have a tough trip ahead you see go to Oakland next week to meet the hot Raiders and then they go to Seattle the following week so they'll stay on the west coast and not come home between games but that is a that's tough sledding not if they play like this yeah they holding the Saints to six points and again I you know I think about that call do you go for do you not go for it again they then down three scores in a game in which they they won't get England back either in all likelihood then the one running back bouncing ball fielded it to 12 and Fozzy Whittaker gets taken down under the 19 yard line and we check in with Heather again all right out former Buckeye Santana Holmes who plays wide receiver for nine seasons in the NFL likes what he has seen tonight after Ted guns touchdown Holmes tweeted just walked into the house to witness a Buckeye touchdown hashtag Ted Ginn a lot of Buckeyes on the field tonight out well Heather Santonio Holmes made a pretty good catch as I recall in the Super Bowl against Arizona which to me was maybe the best of the Super Bowl certainly in the top three from Roethlisberger to win the game the Cardinals a victory this is a short game here for Jonathan Stewart back to you Heather all right Panthers allpro Center Ryan Khalil went into the locker room to his right shoulder examined that same shoulder that forced him to miss the last two games his return is doubtful now the Panthers don't have a lot of depth at center back up Geno Greg hausky is out so Chris Scott is next in line guys his 0 starts at center yeah he's a right guard by trade the back and that's gone first thing to think about is to make sure we get these snaps we saw him in there Brad Kowski had played and started the last two weeks but was made an act of tonight so he will not be in there second and nine and do a little bit of milking of the twat over here in the fort with a threepossession lead Stewart again you know I'll probably the biggest thing with Khalil being out is that he is the guy that makes all the protection calls for the passing game you will literally see him turn around and tell Cam Newton what it is and cam wants it that way he does not want to make the protection calls he's looking down at the secondary so major doubts in my mind about how much Chris Scott knows about sliding the line so we might see some things now defensively out of the Saints show something one way try and get Scott to check that way and then bring the Blitz off the other edge and again burning the clock moving directs traffic throws the catch by Olson is in completely right in front of the Saints bench so they were there providing assistance to the officials interesting when I first saw it I thought he had it let's see I guess possession both feet in his knees there every putt was as I should put down before that but one foot but they could indeed was on the chalk as no challenge he's doing some work around the house the other day in Atlanta when he got the call in and Ely Cuthbert sends the kick down in the 27 yard line Marcus Murphy trying to atone for that misjudgment at the kickoff return which was very costly brings it back to the 49 yard line less than 13 to play in the fourth there's the net football being brought to you by Bad Santa in theaters this lunch they raided our by tmobile switch to the network billed for unlimited data by Chevrolet the hosts awarded car company two years Amazon echo information music more just action NASCAR Hall of Fame NASCAR famous stars artifacts in numerous interactive exhibits on the phone all right from midfield now key drive down by 17 here for the Saints Brees takes the low snap and then high finds a nice crease and picks up 11 getting into the 40yard line they finally just got Luke Kuechly a little bit off stride and able to do that but now for Sean Payton they've got to pick up the pace here a little bit we're still back in the huddle this has got to start moving a little faster here my tower again look at that whole pie tower explodes through it and takes the ball inside the 15yard line untouched as he runs for 27 probably the unsung hero of this offense is Zach Strief who really has had one of the better years of his career big block right there on love popping that one out of there so backtoback runs and here goes the Saints very quickly to the 13 yard line number again great moves slips a tackle in the backfield so the 9 yard line went by Keithley fake Keithley on second down and six I thought Keithley was gonna take his head off right here check this one out what a move there by Hightower you don't see Kuechly taking off his feet very often let me get the license plate on that as it went by second six raising the gun now Franklin and throws and that is caught in the end zone by Brandon Coleman who has seen no action in terms of being targeted tonight and Brandon Coleman second year why not from Rutgers pulls it in and just like that it takes in a minute and 37 seconds to get a touchdown yeah Brandon Coleman had a big day against Atlanta catching seven and that's the backup that's Robert McClain who had to come into the game because of the injury to Leonard Johnson so drew brees taking advantage and wouldn't you know it here come the Saints so you get Coleman at six six the plane is five nine and the kick is good and all of a sudden with 1122 to go it's a 10point game as the Saints finally get into the end zone NFL Thursday Night Football presented by Bud Light here with your tune anniversary today this is the 40year anniversary 48 year anniversary of the famed heidi game through the Jets and in 1968 to kick off here this is Joe Webb he's a quarterback and a running back and the special teams dice and a lot of him through the years taking it out to the 33 the high knee game is the game who's on NBC November 17th of 68 and the network cut away because it was time to show the rest of the country heinie and while everybody was gone the Raiders exploded for two touchdowns won the thrill a phenomenal game and of course some executive made that now if Fred Goodell II was producing and Mark Lazarus was the head of NBC they never would have happened of course never would happen back in 1968 good school the old body is coming off the football game Sal from the 33 that's tipping that's incomplete and if we're Olsen second down and 10 you know the very essence of this game has now changed with Khalil being out Chris Scott missed the first four games of the year with a PD suspension so he really missed a lot of training even at that position and so now on the other side of the ball Dennis Allen for that incomplete pass can dial up a few blitzes or do whatever he wants to do but you got to keep pressure now on Chris Scott so can you ten then rush for set up a spring that's dropped with Stuart all of a sudden now you've got a third and long they'd taken only a few seconds off the clock and you have all night eleven minutes and seven seconds in regulation yeah and that's Sheldon Rankin is their number one draft pick who sniffed that thing out everybody with the Saints talking about how smart that young man is and he's so bright even as a rookie they let him make some defensive calls up there on their line stunts we saw a little bit of that intelligence right there third and ten and the 30 30 and a fourman rush lead to fires over went on that's drop at the 48 yard line by Benjamin and this crowd said wait a minute we've seen this movie before we saw it like Sunday blew a 17point lead and right now in danger of who knows what that is a heck of a defensive play right there that's kid prolly right wow what a big play in a big moment for a backup guy working at a Colorado so they had the ball for all of 20 seconds on that possession Menengah Palardy kicking a flag is down it's a beautiful kick if it stands flag is down up at the 36 yard line near the sideline and those will man downfield yeah I think they may make them kick that one again yeah that was fellas three perfect 53 yards and out of bounds man downfield illegally and they will bring this back ineligible man down field number 14 of the kicking team fiveyard penalty fork down that was Joe Webb who had run that kickback so they bring in battery we can tell you that week 11 the Sunday night attraction is Green Bay Washington backers try to get it together tons of interest going to the nation's capital for cousins and the Redskins who are very much in contention for a playoff spot on Sunday night I know the Tennessee Titans are playing good football right now but they put up 47 on that Packers defense that was tremendous early in the year right actually Clay Matthews gets hurt their best cornerback Sam shields gets hurt it's a little different right now a lot of pressure on Aaron Rodgers to deliver now again this one is a a bit of a line drive filled it to 31 Marcus Murphy brings it back to the 39 yard line 10 to 44 left in regulation well the third annual Art Rooney sportsmanship award honors players who exemplify outstanding sportsmanship on the field each team nominates one player and the NFL players current players will vote it'll be announced at the NFL honors award show February 4th and they're the nominees from these two teams act Streep the right tackle from New Orleans and Greg Olson is stellar tight end of Carolina the good players and two good guys absolutely so the difference that penalty made on the punt they would have had it at the 14 out of 39 so we'll always benefits by 25 yards and they start this Drive with a short pass here to John Kuhn who picks up three or four yards that make it second down and seven now again what this game means Atlanta has to buy this week so there's six and four and they'll stay that way Tampa's four and five Saints trying to get to 500 and Carolina just trying to keep their season alive and go to four and six second down seven from the 42 Greece has that one tip another tip and that's Luke Kuechly getting his hand on it to make a third down and seven and that was really a nice block and pick up by Tim Hightower gonna come right around there and Hightower is going to give him a great shot and kick we still knocks this thing it's like one of those things you have when you're kid you punch in the bounces right back up and you just can't get rid of third and seven the reason is you protected well deep and to the 25yard line comes out incomplete Brandon Coleman who just scored the touchdown had it Trey Boston was there and the ball came out fourth down boy what a bigtime play by Trey Boston who made a huge interception last week and so many times as a receiver it is catching the ball this is a perfectly clean catch and when you hit the ground it just jolts it loose can't complete the catch makes it fourth down and Thomas Moore stood will putt for the third time in the game angled kick fair caught and and drop at the 8 yard line and Ted Ginn is able to we think recover it at the bottom of the pile he does so Carolina just does keep possession the must intend to go at a tenpoint game it's sharp past year coat of many colors was the number one broadcast moving on November 30th Dolly Parton's true story continues with the will the event Christmas of many colors November the 30th right here on NBC nice time in Charlotte North Carolina 15 degrees at the moment Ted Dan that was the 14th time he's fumbled a hunt he's able to recover it the ball is at the 7 yard line and in the backfield Seward gets hit there by barely you know Nick fairly every once awhile just flashed greatness and you see a little bit of that quickness and loop into that power right here watch this move just off the ball so quickly and man they're lucky to hold on to that ball right there Jonathan Stewart good play just to hang on now they're starting to crank up a little pressure maybe they're starting to realize what's going on at the center position here with first got in there they much more in his face is the fullback on second and 13 give it the ham and he will go nowhere scrimmage Kruger and it stirred down at 13 they're going a little conservative here watching this lead we're gonna give drew brees some great field position if they don't come up with this one if you love the offensive coordinator look I'm sorry Mike Shula be right with you in a second after this message ah Mike Dave the whole thing they're all pretty good coaches right third and 13 from the three and a few packages let's see if they try to go after one who's gonna take it himself and came running through the moon we've come up a couple of yards shy of the first down of the 15 yard line so they give themselves a little bit of space they can take the play clock all the way down here and that's three straight three and outs now for Carolina yeah and one of the problems they had when they had that negative play on that first run was now they're inside the 5yard lines that the punt was going to be an abbreviated distance and I think Rivera just wanted room for his punter and Peyton wants to take a timeout here he wants to save what would be about 35 seconds at this point because they were going to run that play clock all the way down to one before they punted so he wants the three seconds put back on the clock he is all of his time mask so I think it's a judicious use of it here at this point to save the time you can say 35 seconds why not do it you know Carolina has just lost so many close games this year what is four games by three points or less errect go through what happened last week and it's got to be in the back of your mind a little bit after blowing that big lead and here comes through breezily great field position recommended his first NFL game moves this one this is a beauty all the way back to the 28 yard line Marcus Murphy looking for some space coverage is excellent knocking down at the 33 flag comes in late as a 56yard punt by a guy who was working in the garage with his fiance last Sunday only got the call to come into the NFL fresh legs Keith I'll say our leg during the return illegal block in the back number 15 saw the receiving team 10yard penalty puts out I tell you this is some play right here by partyin remember it when all the second guessers out there want to talk about Ron Rivera going conservative on the goal line or whatever but he would have had to punt that one from 12 yards instead of 15 yards behind the center here comes a guy off the couch it makes one of the plays of the night he had been with the Carolina in the past and organized team activity so they knew him and he was in Atlanta's camp for a while he was in Cleveland for a while I think is Indianapolis may have been the other place but like a lot of these punters and kickers they're all over the joint let's go to Heather I had a chance to catch up with Mike Florida yesterday and he told me that getting that call on Sunday night was extremely emotional for him tears of happiness saying you know what it was the culmination of three years of hard work lots of twists and turns saying you never know when or even if that call will come it's been a lot of people say no and someone finally saying yes and Heather he got the call he lives in Atlanta so he drove up here four hours on on Sunday night and checked in called the 24 yard line and here's Hightower and hood that stuck at the line of scrimmage for colon filling up from the safety spot to make the tackle you know Kirk Coleman it's a really interesting guy we talked about all the interceptions he had a season ago but he's the swing safety tre Boston is the guy that's back there in coverage and Michael Griffin plays the run so whatever the other guys do best it's up to Kirk Coleman to fill in the other way very good against the run good back deep as well second and 10 breeze spreads it out everybody into the catch Sneed 32 flag comes in through distributing the ball tonight 10 different receivers have caught passes building number 59 defense fiveyard penalty for a new spot automatic first down it's a Kuechly and it's an automatic first down so coming into the game tonight the leading receiver was Michael Thomas out of Ohio State the rookie draft in the second round he's on the court one tonight I almost didn't get to the line of scrimmage on now is the first penalty on Keithley this year the straight Boston makes the tackle a high tower after a gain of six and let's just say this it wasn't the most blatant hold I've ever seen but it was a big one because they were going to have a big third down right there otherwise and that got him going again so under seven here's the penalty again and that hand gets inside the Jersey just a simple plug and they saw it second and five and up to the 37 yard line again Ingraham evaluated free confessions and he's out my tower doing the ball carrying he's carrying eleven times per night for 65 yards now Carolina's starting to react a little bit bringing some safeties down because this run game is getting but this is a big big during a deuce for they swinging at the high collar and a big first down up to the 41 yard line stop there by Thomas Davis and we're under six minutes to go you know and this is sort of that moment in the game now where you know defense is all the great plays they make and that defensive line is starting to get a little tired as short week and one of the things surprising me a little bit is they keep going back to the huddle this is the 61st play run by the Saints tonight freeze throw flag is down Thomas comes away with it and a flag in the secondary no way get that ball in there last year number 26 defense penalty is declined result for the play the first down let's see the rookie and a West Virginia Darryl Worley I mean there is nowhere to throw that ball and he got it if you looked at that thing from where Drew Brees was standing and there was about a sixinch window and a great play by Thomas the walledin you've got a shot taken on cooks who picks up a couple here okay I like that James Bradbury he's a big strong physical guy he gets up in their face and when he hits you 7:45 breeze shoots it out to Hightower stays on his feet and should pick up the first down what is have a nice night let's go to Heather another injury update for you Panthers defense with adult defensive end Mario Addison he leads the team with six and a half sacks two of those came tonight he is out with a right foot injury they've got ice on him and just took them back into the locker room hmm that's a significant loss by bears Harris axes head of just said tonight gone without a draw Hightower taking his way down the 33 yard line mcclain makes the tackle Kuechly shaken up a little bit to play before Hightower's now run the ball 12 times for 69 and caught 6 for 36 and that is Luke Kuechly yeah he was definitely limping back to the field after the last one injury stoppage well that's a badass site if you're a Carolina fan as you can see they're a football fan yeah Luke Kuechly literally it's more than it looked initially still down let's go back to the play at left Lake it's stuck underneath there and it kind of looked like he took a bad step right when he started to make this hit with that left leg but he was sobbing out on the field and I don't know what's going on here this is a guy who plays just about every snap oh my gosh and has for five years oh my gosh I mean nobody loves the game of football and is loved by this city and loved by his teammates more than that guy let's hope he's okay well that's that's an encouraging sighs he would at least stand up before he gets into the cart look at this reception by his team hits yeah oh my gosh just brokenhearted yep it was often not only a fantastic player but if you've been around this guy and you talked to him and we were talking about yesterday about you know remembering the Super Bowl even though they lost and he feels so much different about it now than you did then you feel bad you lost the game but then you think back and you go man you know you dream about this time you're a kid you got to play in the Super Bowl but and you live in fear of that yes you do being taken off on the court I guarantee everybody in this crowd now is just deflated now somebody Thomas Davis probably have to pick this defense up their seasons on the line David Mayo coming to the game of linebacker and now he's the guy who puts the heat on and then Hightower makes the catch breaks tackles and takes the ball to the 21 yard line not only Kuechly up Mario Addison it was two sacks tonight is out Saints come up no huddle ticking down to four minutes so you bring a David Mayo in and instead of leaving him and coverage you blitz in also Leonard Johnson who an author or breeze the fires and a nice neat who cannot hold on to it flag on the play on the other side we offside I think against the Panthers sides number 98 defense fiveyard penalty remains first it's the tool I stole the to line number 98 that's a touchdown saving play right here by James Bradford watch this one this is going to be a catch he comes off of his guy and comes in and makes the hit here to save a touchdown that is going to be a touchdown there's no question about it Willie Sneed had first out in five Brees throws that is caught and breaking attacking his Michael Thomas and he will pick up a first down Thomas Davis shoves them out and it's first and goal for the Saints you know what's amazing is just how methodical they've been with this comeback there has been no panic whatsoever not even a hurry I'm not even a sense of urgency for the most part and just going down the field and I still say the fact that Ryan Khalil went out on the offense changed the ball grease fires caught inside the five Steve not only that you were you're right it's very methodical to the point where down by 20 the astute of a fourth down go for it kick a field goal to stay down by three possessions and now on the verge of maybe making this a threepoint game don't forget Mario Addison who I think has been their best pass rusher for Carolina out of this game as well so Carolina fatigue rushing the passer and Drew Brees starting to pick them apart Brees is 31 of 39 get a flag coming in late in action on both sides of the line Streif and Johnson both start and the calling on Strief that was interesting it was a delayed call it didn't look like street moved the defense reacted then jumped back and started pointing and then they finally threw the flag 301 on the clock second go you'll see a lot of crisscrossing over there they candle but then broken up and almost intercepted Kony Ealy Kony Ealy knocking it down excellent point making it third that a goal probably touched out saver right there Kony Ealy they were coming across the formation and Kony Ealy who will never forget the game he had the Superbowl probably would have been the NBP at Carolina would has made another huge one there third and goal split hightower fourman rush over the middle and that is Coby Fleener for the touchdown a bullet right down the middle now right where Luke Kuechly would have been we've got Thomas Davis on one side now instead of Kuechly you've got David Mayo and Drew Brees said let's check him out see how he does right in there boy he threw that ball former Coby Fleener thought about turning around way it is game on now mister trying to make it twenty three to twenty Lux with more stayed holding now you've got a threepoint game you've got 252 and you've got the Saints with two timeouts and the twominute warning when Drew Brees gets it going it is tough to stop and Thomas Davis barely missed that one you play that kind of Tampa to where you're gonna drop that middle linebacker you remember earlier in the game that was Craig Robertson and chase Ted Ginn all the way to the end zone same sort of defense right there but when you're on the goal line you don't want to back up too far right because Drew Brees gonna get it in there in front of you well Ron Rivera is talking about we have to finish games and here they are again putting themselves in a precarious position you're almost leaving it to your offense right now to get some first downs and take all the time you can't off that clock and I think that you're going to see the Saints bringing all kinds of pressure they have a pressure point with Chris Scott be in the center you've got the pressure point of the fact that this game now is on the line you go after them here lunch the kick that's Joe Webb back Fozzy Whittaker is back there as well from the goalline web he slips and thus is taken down the 15yard line they hit there by Shiloh Keo and that is bets back on the 15yard line so we're talking about field position you know let's go back to the beginning of this game and Carolina had a couple of nice plays right off the bat with some motion and going wide and all the different things but some of those plays are really tough to one though when you get the feeling that you're going to see a lot of pressure coming off the edge the only reason the Saints don't bring that kind of pressure is because they're burning a little bit at the quarterback position a little afraid of man coverage here the Panthers have had three straight bring it out Newton throws and that is errant and a flag comes in those two par that tangled up with Jonathan Stewart Carl Johnson comes in to make this call there's no cow on the party so Karla head linesman who was the head of officiating a few years ago and a head linesman threw the flag within it's waved off here it is again it's a great job here by Nathan stoop are you cannot have pass interference behind the line of scrimmage and that's exactly what it was to understand that Rivera pleading his case obviously no valid second down and ten now and is it nervous time in this ballpark Newton goes nowhere and hang a third down and the Saints are gonna take a timeout so they are down to one plus the twominute warning and of course and drew drew brees world it might as well be a month on the calendar all right a little bit of the pulse here Newton take a look at those numbers not very good breeze Benoit 32 of 41 to 42 less than what he normally averages but still he's had it when he needs it 17 unanswered and there's the most depressing side of the night in the Carolina back in the locker room and you'll get a report as soon as we can on him man you you just have to take your shot here right now and I know there's some things working against you but you just cannot turn around and kick the ball back to Drew Brees at this point he's not thinking field goal with this one he's thinking let's go get us a touchdown and get out of here with a win bigtime play here they've got Ted Ginn they've got Kelvin Benjamin they have Devin conscious down to Saints look like a group pressure and they don't linebackers back off looming traffic throws and that is taught by Kelvin Benjamin that is a big catch boy did they need that not much of a route just got in behind the defense here and the decision to not bring pressure there very interesting one you could have almost told what was going to happen there Kelvin Benjamin is just a biggerthanlife wide receiver they play above the rim in these key situations you sit back in his zone he doesn't care about getting hit you just throw it up high and he out rebounds everybody that is a core element of this offense gutsy catch to go up and hang on to that one but no pressure gave it a chance and then it's a gigantic first down New Orleans that takes its last timeout so the only time the clock will stop now is at the twominute warning after most likely this play here comes the pressure again Stewart is the running back we just want to get the clock down to two minutes and they will on the 2 yard game to the 35 so it'll be second down and eight when we go to the other side of the twominute warning and Brees get the ball back man what a bigtime throw and catch that was when they needed it most we come down to the twominute warning in a tight one in Charlotte Carolina 23 the Orleans 20 this Thursday right after the game it's the Volkswagen postgame report Heather on the field interviewing the stars of the game and will take a preview look at Sunday night's game between the Packers and the Redskins second down and eight now and ball is handed off to Tolbert and that will take 40 seconds on the clock as we go to heather al we saw an emotional Luke Kuechly get carted into the locker room right now the Panthers are telling us that Keithley is in the locker room being evaluated for a concussion now remember he did miss three games in 2015 with a known concussion that season and will not return in this game yeah that's see those are the only three games that he's missed in his career and therefore almost every every snap and we thought it might have been his leg but turns out to be obviously something else and fit the best hair you can taking the clock there you lay down on third and eight you can on the ground to do like your Fosse Whitaker's just stay inbounds and that's going to take you down to about a half minute so Brees will have oh you know probably a little less than 30 seconds with the time we get down there to try to get them into field goal range you know I just have to go back for one moment to the decision to play the zone out of that play most defensive coordinators not all but most defensive coordinators in that situation will bring the Blitz believing even if they throw hot you can come up and make the tackle at about seven yards force the punt and go on now I'm not saying it's the wrong decision I'm just saying typically hitting this league that's what you see surprising time out here let's go back to the Benjamin catch and they look like pressure but then they drop out and they're just going to rush for here and they do get close to getting the Cam Newton now there is definite pressure right up the gut if you can understand what I'm saying typically if you bring one more than they can block they have to throw hot on the outside usually a slant or some kind of a stop route to come up and make the play and you know there's no writing at your it's just that's the typical one that I see Emma with your brother always thick or thin until Sunday Mike flora Thea took but a big boy in his first NFL game another booming kick 13 yard line Marcus Murphy and he will get taken down 25 then there's a flag at the end of the play and there's another flag that comes in from the moment you got 14 seconds on the clock they're gonna return holding number 54 of the CVT 10 yard penalty first out and that's about the last thing they needed that's Nate's two parts and now you're forced to air it out 14 seconds and hope to get out of bounds you don't have a timeout so you'll need a long pass if you're Carolina you got a you know guard the sidelines but then again you gotta be careful over the middle you can you can catch one over the middle but you better fly get out of bounds I think this is one of those you just throw a Hail Mary at the sidelines and hope for the best I'm trying to get Lutz and field goal range because you have to throw this thing 50 yards plus just to have a chance at a field go on the other side right but since careerlong is 57 he won the game with 11 seconds left in the season Koosman last month so breeze now escapes he just dumps it off here in its high tower and it tries to get out of bounds to save at least one play six seconds well you have big tight ends but not so big wide receivers we've seen Brandon Coleman go up and get one Michael Thomas is a big body I'm not even sure now you can throw a Hail Mary in get out of bounds this might be one of those Stanford plays now the only thing people you need a Stanford player you need a defensive foul deep downfield which would extend the game by one play sabri's was in front of the sideline and do it one more play they do Michael Thomas makes the catch and now you gotten up at the 36 yard line which is fine and dandy but now what do you do I mean I it's fine it may not be dandy though we should kind of jugs gun to throw this thing 65 yards into the end zone who knows maybe Drew Brees can still do it I don't know if your trailer well kinds of gimmicks it's gotta buy some time to let those receivers get down there anyway since the threeman rush are they gonna accident to a little short pass here give it to Thomas and he'll go as far as he can but only to the 44 yard line well they made this crowd sweat or not didn't make huge when it was 23 three lines up twenty three twenty seats of these teams is now four and six they are each two games behind the division leading Atlanta Falcons and the volkswagen horse game show coming up on the other side of the break
