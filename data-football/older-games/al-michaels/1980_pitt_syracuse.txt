============================================================

Stadium Syracuse upset mania 22:17 this was the final game in the 71 year old stadium that had been the home of Syracuse University football on this very ground would rise the new Carrier Dome literally workmen began the following Monday uprize souvenir of old Archbold the workmen began tearing it down and literally after all the work had begun was only one year until this magnificent structure was completed 50,000 season here was a great moment when the inflatable roof was pumped up the final stages and here was last summer as the carrier dome was in fact the new sparkling home of the Orangemen cost 27 million dollars well today was a rather nasty morning rain asleep stolen a cold wind blew in but inside the Carrier Dome were very pleasant 65 degrees and dry or this meeting between the Pitt Panthers who are 6 and 1 on the season ranked 10th in the United Press poll against Syracuse for entry and playing better respectable games against powerhouses like Ohio State and later without the services of Joe Morris against Penn State this ABC Sports exclusive is brought to you by lowenbrau but you want the taste of a truly great beer there's really only one tonight let it be löwenbräu by Chevrolet and your Chevy dealer with Chevette Monza citation and the new Monte Carlo Chevy's up ahead for 1981 and by IBM helping information to work for people hello everybody I'm bill Fleming along with Broyles and welcome to homecoming on the campus of Syracuse University this would be a win that would be very welcome for the orange bin not since 1972 has Syracuse defeated Pittsburgh the Frank comes at a very tough year because Pitts defense is probably the greatest in their history it certainly is bill and we've got a great matchup because Joe Boris is clearly established himself as well the best backs in America he's the driving force behind this football team and he's got a good good chance to have another day just as he had in the early games rushing for about 160 yards they need him to have a healthy roll and he's up against the number one defensive football team in a man these Panthers are big they're strong was the host of this game well it certainly was it was from puck formation it was really a hairsplitting call by the officials in had to do with the up back on putt formation he was lined up neither on the line of scrimmage or in the backfield can you see you can see the error on your screen he's one half a yard behind the line clearly a foul but as I said highly technical bill and what happened was simply this Syracuse punted it was a great bunt it went all the way down it was fielded by Joe Joe Heath and he barely got out of the end zone hope it would have been buried very close to its own goal line on the one foot line that is not how it turned off because they called the fiveyard penalty for that man illegally placed his Alliance Ben talked it over with the referee so that was the situation as Al Michaels and Frank Broyles saw it so let's go back to their call of the game this bird was fair lucky on that play they would be starting from the one problem white is averaging 37 yards of kick and this time instead of team it's Terry White who drops back for the Panthers another low kick but again good distance White has to back up well as it turned out it was certainly a significant play because there was the final score hit wanted by seven points and it could have gone without that play either way so Pittsburgh won a 28 to 21 and don't think the orange man hadn't been thinking about that now here is jackie sherrill who was standing in the tunnel on the far side waiting for the Pitt Panthers he'll be dressed in white today to come on to the field ranked 10th in the nation in the latest UPI poll now the significance of this game I think is twofold it's significant certainly for Syracuse Frank and as far as bowl aspirations Pittsburgh definitely has to have a big impressive win no question in Pittsburgh has a lot of fake also they've gold begin compete realize this they have to get an invitation to one of the major bowls Dallas New Orleans and the first step in that direction would be to win very impressive and Syracuse has voted for Syracuse they have made zillion burst is made of four men brings of the Orangemen back to problem this big great facility is their first indication and should build they be able to office upset Pittsburgh what a boost Oh Jackie so syracuse came out man just in their dark Jersey and their pumpkin right helmets which seems appropriate on the day after Halloween so we'll be ready to go with this one Pitt and Syracuse a new Chevy citation we said it was a whole new kind of compact car and well there's the series record and with all of you apologies to the people of Pittsburgh we didn't mean to leave the SI you got it threat once though frankly as you can see it was it's it's Pittsburgh out in front as far as the overall series is concerned this rivalry has been going on for a while the rivalry between syracuse Pitt Penn State and West Virginia I think one of the great rivalries the to bill and the East has made a commitment if we said that Syracuse wants to climb back to the summit it's out of bounds on about the fiveyard line so they'll have to boot it over well what a perfect day it is Eastside here today 62 and it's terrible outside windy and cold a kind of had a cold reading that goes right through you up here in this part of the northeastern section of the United States though it goes right through you though oh it was cold this morning looked out the window Bill and it was snowing Gary Anderson will do the booty from the 35 well we hope you enjoyed the first game of our doubleheader today what a tremendous game contain Georgia South Carolina nation is that the Bulldogs won it by 3 but the duel between Walker and Rogers with Justin Mendes hope you had a chance to see it there it is great guys that's up to about the 27 yard all right let's take a look now we'll be seeing expert panel senior from Brooklyn Ohio at quarterback Joe McCall number 34 freshman from Miami Florida Randy McMillan the veteran in the backfield from Jarrettsville Maryland and then Mike Collins freshman Aliquippa Pennsylvania really Collier will be the light out with a guy over see you from Cordele Georgia Rick took on over senior quarterback who was the safety man for injury Turkana though two weeks ago came back as the quarterback when marina he has been selling the offensive line up front for a Pittsburgh a left tackle Jimbo covert 264 in a sophomore left guard is Bob Theta 245 in a sophomore the center is Russ Grimm 270 in a senior right guard mo Boras 266 in a junior right tackle allamerica candidate Park May 275 and Benjy Pryor is number 84 senior died in its now second in five fires at complete at the 45 yard line Benji fire is tied in that's the first dog now defensively for Syracuse not a lot of experience here is you'll see we have defensive end Chris hand and Mike Charles but ski and Kimmel Zoo Nick Collins Bingham Hinton Kilpatrick Eric open and spits first down and it's up to almost Medfield Joe McCall the running back getting it to that point this looks very good these first series bills very important to establish the confidence obviously they've got Syracuse a little bit on the move running three times and passed and once placing the bindi prior defensive end as Jimmy Kimmel starting his first game just a freshman eightythree next time you know I don't think we could say enough about the quarterback story Franken while we do have a moment I think we should mention that the track on oh did something that you just don't find very often there when it with a starting role which was his a year ago was won by a moreno he didn't he didn't slosh around and say and feel sorry for himself a shucks you know what's the matter he went to the coaching said hey I want to play when Tobin plate safety Manning played very well all spring and most of the fall in place so well takes the hand off and it's quite columns the flanker at the 40yard line another first down for the Panthers a 15yard pickup and they're showing a nice crisp offensive machine here in the early going they really are dry Collins as the freshman brilliant sensational athlete just a little simple turn in but he was a man prior was up in front he caught the safe to man up and Collins was wide open against Tennessee and for one touchdown separate hippie jackie sherrill on the sidelines his fork here has that go to the Panthers and he'd done a good job bill three gold teams in a row and this year one of the finest football teams in America both office have indeed them defensively they have the weapons in any case you did visit Hershel Walker rushed for 219 yards Georgia South Carolina you know in the first game playing against Boston College I think it's something like nine receptions is one of the finest tight ends in America and you're gonna watch trapano drop back and for you fans at home watch his work he's looking right down the middle and he sees Syracuse being spurred on by this capacity crowd here 27 or 28 yard line he's got he's got a circle on top mysteries I'm sure but that was pwned on the defense there it definitely his coaches feel he's mature at the one thing that you learned playing defensive sake to do things really you learn to talk when he learned go through this the quickness drills and ready for that last play feel he had a knock down deep for the first down first and 10 for 5th on the 27 yard line there's a marker down as McCall gets to the 24 yard line remember so many white Charles a 270 percent more brought him God did I mention the inexperience in that defensive I'm Bob Syracuse as contrasted with Pitt all seniors on the fifth side but we've got three sophomores and a freshman on the front for for Syracuse one thing bill if you can say about the Orangemen they play hard and they played together I've looked at all of their film I saw him play last year one thing there that they will get after you then they don't stay block very long they're not big but they do have quickness but one thing you mentioned they lack overall team speed to match the Pittsburgh Panthers illegal proceeds you're setting the Panthers back it's a first and 15 again a look at I'm sophomore who won the starting role as a freshman a year ago and fathanah was hurt himself was worth in the 16 more you see teams going to that big tiny the reason for that there is that they are so talented number one in cycling many teams using faster and so there's an open area in front of the safety man is thirdly Enterprise quite a target six foot four and 225 well he's caught three passes today for 40 of those 45 yard it's second down on that particular play no story just begun incomplete the defensive van was him it might have bumped him and everybody I think collectively and was holding their breath to see if in fact there was contact they fired you he called it just right the fish was right on top of it he was bending within three yards of the play and he did not call him in offense evidently he they could hold them in force the threepointer Carla stop by Tim cards middle I'm back senior yes Jim Collins is been the lead of this defensive unit he had 101 tackled so far this year is the ventline back ok here is Dave Trump who is 6 for 10 on field goals as long as this year as a 41 year der this will be 37 and it's on its way and it is good so this player takes the lead here the early going by the score of three to nothing but I think that the research Hughes fans are heartened by the defense forcing pip to get only free back adjustable you mean you're still changing tires every winter honey where is the other snow tire I can't find the snow tires found a cab yeah we can but just no time for anything by the way from Friday good near tiempo eliminates winter tire change over because tiempo is a rain tire snow tire some tire one tire that does it all how about a we then quality and innovation no experience no job I could do that job but it would give me the chance of fact payers are demanding accountability in public institutions nowhere is the TEL ability war evident in high school activities which involve half the students of most food and less than onefifth a local school budget that's the best bargain and education here's a young man who has the distinction of being ranked in the top 15 in the nation at koban Syracuse in kick returns so he's the deep man he'll be along there on the other side has plenty more with him number 44 Dave ready to addictive all scores to go in this first glad you could join us for this one of those big hi kids coming down besides too many white jerseys on the offensive backfield on for Syracuse Dave Warner jr. at quarterback and in the backfield with him Joe Mara's fivefootseven junior Kent Mandeville a senior at the fullback spot and Paul Zeb Yuto a speedy junior flankers Marcus packet the white out defense and there's no huddle by the way I'll give it back to you it's kind of strange everybody was on the side the offensive line will have Kissinger as the tackle at 276 248 a junior left guard the center is Jerry theory 241 John Lally at guard at 251 and tackle on the far side 259 a twoyear John McCallum Chris Java is the time Marcus Hewlett that upsets Frank Maloney just a little bit coverage by the Pittsburgh Panthers with Warner rolling out to the left the defense moves right over you have to receive was covered although he could have made a sensational catch reminds me where's being healed and they are all soon which 264 on the third day pass is intercepted by the foot compose and it's picked off I saw some Surrey on the rebound or hit one of the players on the headgear good reaction by Sunseri but there's a marker talking about the 13 so obviously Syracuse is hoping desperately the penalties penalties against Pittsburgh Warner shaken up on that play ball a lot of pressure on them Frank yes there was one thing that Syracuse has got to have this pass protection bar water on this case he didn't have it he was rolling out throwing back just a little bit Olga the middle which is a very difficult role very average fake because he's setting up the throw but you can see that it goes right into Tom Flynn number five the freshman and it is locked out white and finally Sunseri the fine line factor the junior the football team wants to be a fullback and he uses his stiff arm and finally I guess it was Warner that knocked it finally made the tackle yo you know that good point frankerz i thought warner may have been hit that free through it actually where he was shaken up a little bit was going the first quarter leading players cause her footsteps Pittsburgh coaches feels like feel like but he is one of the great players in America even though he's just a freshman he's had a sensational year so far but he took his eyes off of this play his Kilpatrick number 19 was in the Hall of let him know that he shouldn't catch the ball inside and in completed way and Kilpatrick is coming at him at an angle where Collins could see him yes so here comes Collins out wide to the right house but way out as the flanker on the second intent situation is on the 40 one thing they'll scuse me one thing that Syracuse has got the guard against is letting Randy McMillan 225 pound fullback get turned down field north and south if you can redirect him and force him to go sideways he's not as effective as he is once he comes down blocking me pigheaded this is the fourth year situations here in this first period hi good coverage but these men were covered and syrupy forcing a fourth in five situation at 34 yard line 35 Chris pan the left defensive end is the one that put pressure on Chicago and didn't give him a chance to wait till Pryor came open over cross pattern Dave Hepler is back averaging 39 yards a kick Jim sweetie II the snapper is gone in number 53 for Pitt gets it a little low however got some pressure there he floats one down to the left corner and it's going to go out of bounds close to the 5 twenty nine yards but Hepler didn't want the art adji wanted the accuracy it just cheated Syracuse out of 15 extra yard you know one thing that there is Dave pepper one thing that we want to mention is that it's very difficult to verbalize that is cheap and both teams have been working on hand things because they have they have prayed that they'll make the mistake and they won't get the world well I'll tell you that defense is really tough Horace Horace is going to have his work cut out for them this afternoon they're going to go after them try to confuse them and give them losses and Buster plays is up to about the seven or eight yard line new Joe living a little bit here missed three games because of a shoulder injury and during that time so you realize how important you really is to her now you long back or is that here on the pleasure by the Orangemen I should point out but the reason for the nohuddle is to try to catch Pittsburgh in the wrong defense don't give them time to call all of their various multiplicity of assignments force them to play one defensive made in Syracuse and have a better chance to make some first downs but not so far in good will yard effort longest 52 and Bruce Babcock number 50 is gone in as the expert Stefan that is taken that's the 31yard line so a brilliant kit putting Syracuse in a hole is covered but not so brilliant a kick by a Syracuse back in just a moment babies television sighs can I get a twohour special it's an eye on you battle of the Network Stars December 5th thought we'd easy you know one thing we should point out I think about the Pittsburgh team is that they have been played in the first seven games have had 32 that's what Syracuse is defense is really gambling on here is commenting on the fact that you've got to have that break we've got to be able to force that pump force that interception because we can't stay with a very strong no doubt about it whispers the one game that they'd lost was the Florida State they turned the ball over seven times built most of them on their own side of the 50yard line field goal opportunity we have a second and eight situation with the ball just inside the 33 to nothing over Syracuse Jim comes on a headon collision thirty further down rather in the ball back to the thirty we can see on the screen Jim khaalis getting defensive signal trying to figure what a head pulls his two backs in there tight Nepal and he's got his hand bombs above the 19yard line on the isolation watch cog you know what good receivers do is they deceive the defense's back into thinking that they don't do something different so that they can get open and a first out so if it converts to make a first in ten on the 19 yard line of Syracuse first quarter Pittsburgh leading three to nothing good defensive play man was there rust Spitz got his hand on the football and deflected up high so that the receiver couldn't get to it Walker's down Syracuse as if to make was 41 to go in the first quarter and again in case you join is a little bit late we are bringing this game to you first game ever televised from the Carrier Dome Syracuse New York for two years dances away if it's inside the 15yard line turkey is very definitely defense and stop Pittsburgh from getting seven points and maybe best bacon three there's number 73 mark made little guy only goes to seven six six down the size of these good evening well that was perfectly played back you a big plus is a penalty like we can see it maybe a 15year talking to Collins the defensive captain of Syracuse the marker was thrown at the 24 yard line that's what it is amazing folks will come back to the 29 here's that that new one that we've been seeing occasionally frankic splendid well build thee the rules make this felt like that the lanlan blocking for the pass is the toughest skill to master they need some help and so they can use their hands to try to control the offensive lineman's walk devious mind as long as you don't crack he slithers three down to about the 18 yard line as our copain brings him down I think that going back to that bruising through I think it's Vivek help to passing in college football that's another reason cuz it takes a head out of the blocking and let you use your hands a little bit more will try for his second field goal I think that's often that that's good it just did go over the left right so Pittsburgh has made two field goals here in the first quarter however Syracuse goal line is still detected from a touchdown back in just about in New York this is Dave dials with special bonus coverage at norman oklahoma JC Watts of the Sooners has just gone six yards for touchdown in the third period Oklahoma leading North Carolina at 21 to 7 1055 left in the third well you know there were only six undefeated untied teams in Division one a going into today's game today's games I should say a North Carolina okay Lana as you saw I think in the third quarter all right here is Dave job he was just kicked a 34yard for the Panthers sales one 20 and I think we ought to say something here Frank about the significance of this nohuddle we what psychologically do not do the purpose of forcing the defense to limit what they can do if the TV uses a nohuddle they don't have time to call all the various different alignments that they could use and therefore it gives Syracuse a little bit better chance of knowing what to expect from the Pittsburgh peoples and now this is we explain they go home what was a successful I think I drop it too first exam quarterback he's got senior defensive front five dildos very very strong they have the muscle but you have the movement to go with it they build an anchor points for the few green and Jackson of those linebackers to just roam at will and that's reasonably the nation did you join school delay we did mention the fact that a lot only 58 yards per game and not a singer first time it's very close nice reaction as Ricky Jackson brought him down first out and freezing the chair listen please they want to yell very Kepler they want something to happen because excuse has not made a first down and their first two possessions they need to get something Haven and lo Warner who has taken upon himself and receivers who puppet to scramble for the first number 79 John McCallum label the first time you would have been sure if he Jetson has the football solo Pittsburgh now gets the ball goes hand came off the ball at the 32 yard line so here is piss playing flawless ball and Syracuse which have been hoping for some mistakes on the opposite side makes the bedroom right here very definitely one thing you want to do on the oil field is the whole ball properly protected so that someone can not strip it out and give the opposing team just gold did you see whether the ball No yes yes let's burn out in front we have exactly three minutes to go in this first quarter really the better field position of the two teams and converted into green to threepoint plays Ricky Jackson there you know you green does get a lot of publicity mighty tough he's to 17 because the other hosing do you design their offices to run away from mr. Hugh green all twotime allamerican look at his acceleration bangs them out of bounds at the 18yard live it will be a first time Randy McMillan that's good side lot of experience comes from the Jarrettsville America excellent blocking Bob and lures the right side of the offensive line and they they just moved them back to gave McMillan here we have an injury that's an article play and the fellows knocking on a bombs he took a pretty good shot because McMillan is a little bit like a runaway tank when he gets going on a sweet play the time and has the key block he must keep the defensive end you see them are 84 Benjy prob driving back keeping this team what we call finishing the block we have a saying in coaching if you keep your base you stay off your face and that's what you have to do in coaching and playing that position tied in on that particular block are the things okay a lot of defensive stops here in this first quarter you know the defensive unit Syracuse has been on the field a lot and that could have a telling effect later robbery game Iori end of the field and that's what's happened to poor Syracuse they cannot make the first down they've had poor kick and they've turned over the ball by a fumble an interception giving Pittsburgh today he is driven back by about four she refuses best tackle play the tide Ian fryer be blocked at number 48 zooni to stand up linebacker and Zhu Nick is not as big as proud but he does do what we ask the defensive en de Duke use his hands to protect and then disconnect and react to the ball in lower pipe sneak makes the play along with some help from Charles inside inside and he gets his nose right on the tenure team before da tunak in on the stop again he ran for a touchdown you know against a state with him in the subject quarterback threw the ball out in the platen Zoo just stepped in 11 yards for the touchdown one thing we should mention is that with the football position to get close to the goal line that's something that they like to use jackie sherrill making a few notes in Oz we have a third diamond team the panel to total car I just couldn't say enough Frank about that first game we saw on ABC today about the running of Walker and the running of Rogers oftentimes when you have a matchup like that and it's build up by everybody saying watch Bill Walker watch Rogers it doesn't come off so well maybe for one or the other or anything but it wasn't the case today because when you look at the statistics on that deal George Rogers had 168 yards and Herschel Walker the freshman sensation of the Bulldogs had 290 now between them Frank that's nearly 400 yards well they have two of the very best in America what they have going for they'll they have been muscle and they have the C both teams use them very wisely running inside outside trance screens when you give them the ball enough and they gonna make enough guy they just took our kids never George he'll run back the invitation mr. 15 to 10 elusive thrower power i formation one thing we want to watch is the intensity of the play all the goalline you people at home watch the blocking and whether it goes look that out about picked up at 89 chris hemsworth got touched he came from the back side and wrestled the call to the ground phone very short Jeanne six second and goal situation here's for Syracuse to build a line on new line of scrimmage in the back feel if they possibly can of Pittsburgh only has four or five seconds now in this first quarter and Turkana wants to talk things over with jackie sherrill let's quickly take a look at how the top ten are doing today Alabama Mississippi State deadlocked in the second quarter alabama UCLA in the first quarter zip zip against Arizona third ranked Notre Dame warded on maybe today if 33 to nothing well we'll be showing that game a little bit later with gifts the Alabama Notre Dame in two weeks I am Georgia defeated South Carolina and that fuller from Athens today Oklahoma now has gone up 21 to 7 against North Carolina I think we saw that a little bit earlier on the update Nebraska 28 13 and a half time over a tough Missouri team Nebraska number eight in the nation so strategy has been set with a second six the second and goal situation Pittsburgh out in front by the score of six to nothing with five ticks on the clock in the first quarter from the Carrier Dome in Syracuse New York a comfortable 62 degrees inside and I might say no win I was gonna say the same thing normally you think we'll the timeout they were trying to get keep the win for what a play but not in this beautiful beautiful facility what a tribute it is to the Syracuse University and the friends and supporters that they have in this area and that it's all pay for that the key they had ever have to like the record mode 27 million dollars seventysix the ball on the sets of Syracuse picked rittany leading six to nothing in the first quarter touchdown as Joe McCall sees through there and he was hard Joe McCall I love that feel a bootleg play and I think chicano expected to run the ball over but the defense played the run part of it perfectly but they forgot about McCall who had slipped out of the backfield and came across in behind unknowingly to any of the Syracuse the business watch how wide open years they'll I could have thrown that there have great execution Benjie Pryor was right there had he not caught it so we now have a 12 to nothing game and that ran out the clock of the first quarter jackie sherrill is unhappy with trapano for calling the timeout i think that we should make notice that make note off that pittsburgh has used the shoestring play a couple of times you remember they used the throw in the game early and the season against Boston College that's the swinging gate where they where they fake the horn and run for two days to say it alright while we have this timeout let's so once again join Dave dials in New York dials live camera coverage Norman Oklahoma 28 to 7 Oklahoma leading six lengths North Carolina 551 to play in the third period Oklahoma touchdown JC Watts a oneyard win oklahoma 2807 leading 16th North Carolina well it looks like the Sooners now I have really taken a commanding lead over North Carolina previously undefeated and untied one of six in the nation so we boil it down each week it seems Frank we've got to Alabama and Baylor and George is still undefeated and then Notre Dame still undefeated North Carolina going down and then UCLA is the other one so it's it looks like it's gonna be five and maybe more there we have an all reaching and parity I think in college football now I think it's a healthy sign that teams around the country are even out do so white collar's number thirtytwo running pond had two men on him and the score remains 12 nothing doesn't make jackie sherrill very happy but we have come to the end of the first quarter that's the school Royals getting ready to begin the second quarter here in Syracuse New York Dave trout teeing it up I'd say one very significant thing Frank you've got to have the football in order to do anything in Syracuse is that they have the football along with the great play of Pittsburgh units to not make a first down with poor field position turn it over Cobin the end zone for the third time cannot run it back good look at Joe McCall who scored the only touchdown of the day's game Joe's seeping back behind the secondary into the end zone and grabbing it Joe McCall a very talented freshman for Miami Florida yes that's right a pleasure Syracuse cheering section here was there blue pompoms exhorting their team to get moving first in town on the target wedding in the second row number 66 in there I'm sorry both of these first quarter statistics you'll see what we mean about time and position well they they reflect exactly what we've seen overwhelming advantage to Pittsburgh in every category all the way down except the 150 recuse trying to avoid the colonel was too we will be a great football team they have not had a mistake surprise water swarm Oh where's the boy stuff my Thunder 86 the defensive left out 250 she gets one look and that's all he does for the quick pass for some ice cream is it goes big for deep they have going penetration in the backfield you can see wanna get one look murasky number 68 stylistically sizzle Sunseri Jackson field position for sure Hughes terrible the beat Pittsburgh you've got to get the ball down for Barry in the field and hope they'll make a mistake you're not gonna move 80 yards again very often maybe once the ballgame at the very most if you're very good this time the previous one was only 23 yards but it is taken there by the deep Fangio's talking donkeys somehow worms his way out of it and gets the ball up to about the 35 yard line I see a marker down on the far side of the field don't know whether that was a penalty marker or whether it was just to mark the ball this is only the second possession where this burg is honest visit with all except when they were bound beef and Syracuse territory ABCs NFL Monday Night Football live at 9 o'clock Eastern Time what a matchup the fairs in the brown tell you that Brian's site was really something against the Steelers in that grilling upset of the Steelers last week and Browns will be facing Walter Payton in the Chicago Bears it'll be interesting to see how spectacular a site will be against the movie for Cleveland's right on the heels of three straight pictures and well and I believe we're going to get an interference call here although the pass was complete Benjie Pryor was on the receiving end of it think that the mistake penalty has caused by the fact that the defensive back is going off college number 32 into the play from the rear he breaks let's he pushed it into number 18 and hip pushes closed down Collins in the problem worth it they will decline the penalty so llamas on the 32 yard line Pitt leads 12 nothing we are into the second quarter just two minutes into it the sidelines an almost unstoppable play to Blake Collins one thing that receivers have to do is to make the defensive back miss read their attentions see if they feel at home and watch Collins push down and see if you can tell what his intentions are any peloton hitting love 18 the defensive back what the spread when Collins breaks it off Hinton is not in the picture because he thought College was going deep finally Hinton of a team comes in and wrestlers and out of bounds first down on the 49yard in the first at this time in a fine defensive play Tom Seavers number 26 was a sensational play Sivan is the defensive linebacker and had he not gotten his hand about seven feet in the air looked like he would have been a completion to fry and probably touch them that was great second down and ten ball at the 49 yard line Pittsburgh is out in front and has possession of the football drills it down to the 40th and her foot ski brings him down one thing I really like about ricado he can float the ball he can zap it in there and he control arm and he knows what to do with the Blitz company because on this particular Kaiser you've seen 33 first blitzing up the middle and he just lays the ball out to the battery is too safe the valve outlet secondary receiver boarding the lost and then Mike Miller who knows what to do with it when he gets it under his arm big boy sir he goes he goes to the outside he's got a touchdown no man has scored for the bankers and brilliant piece of running got a call that was it was a beautiful car and we're gonna watch this again from the sidelines except the whole fight Malloy the Syracuse folks was standing what from the camera see the blocking develop right on the line of scrimmage the lamina go step back like a pass at the draw plate in fight the defensive lineman to rush and now McMillan when he gets north in saudis South as I said William at the show when he goes down that be a watch out he knows what to do with the ball even though he's a fullback he combines POW and speed and the extra point is up and good and so the Panthers have shown their offensive strength here with their second touchdown leading by the score of 19 to nothing and we have 1201 to go in the first half he blew past Kilpatrick who was really in position to stop him and didn't even react it was so quick there to see the speed bill call that big use do you think it you could catch him but very few he'll I watched him play three times and he gets on home field he's very difficult to bring down this truck to come on he gets them high there's just Norway koban ranked 15th in the nation and it returns he's been able to kick should return any one of the four go to the Buddha to we're gonna take another quick look at McMillan's great run watch the block and watch the two guards number 70 number 77 and number 56 grim makes the very key block that Springs Macmillan into the secondary and then Aquafina number 20 cannot get him to the ground he'd already bypassed Kilpatrick and then number 15 well but it's one second to go on the surf you can handle attack here first exam before the ball carrier that even starts to move as Meissner for a yard and meal all in there feel like I said earlier the chill deep are so aggressive there they are ranked number one in the NCAA and total defense number one again rush they try to intimidate the opposing team I don't care who they put they want to blend some Christ through and give me some bad plays and they have turned in big on the freedoms of other content last time that Syracuse have the ball they gained a yard they just lost to you Jellico is running two men right there third down and 12 another critical situation for Syracuse they get out of the long yardage situation to where they have to throw the ball cutter scores that you'll be interested in today like that you have to have big blocks and get Freddie through these you will see that waters on the floor back against the grain as you can see the poll around the completion 47 those are outside of the job one thing that they will see oh this particular play is that water's gonna roll out he's looking down feel he wants to go down a vehicle and receive as a cover to reacts perfectly lays the ball off to his secondary receiver Marston first I'm running jewel absolutely knows what the Dooley runs down the field for near first down Pittsburgh 19:11 here in the first half the temple offensive formation that confused the default 86 brings him down again let me free just go across that defensive five few greens 222 but then he go 250 275 255 those three middle men they didn't have the manpower in the backyard tomorrow's a 47yard line you know that was perfectly played by the Pittsburgh defense short y'all two defenses you talk to penetrate Hugh Green is going to recognize the price one thing he does is protect himself read the play and then react and you see why he's a twotime allamerican chance for the third year in a row Jim goodwill is it's a horrible one good field position as far as Syracuse is consuming the pizza day because they've got the Panthers back there well there was a case where good booth has really been a very good thanks to Mars to one of the very fine brothers in America he's averaged 162 yards to game so far and missed three ball games to cause an injury 9 minutes 21 seconds to go in the second period the Panthers of Pitt ranked 10th in the nation the United Press poll ahead of Syracuse first the 42 yard line no he didn't have to do that the ball was overthrown but Cedric was right on the back of Benji Pryor it's unusual to see the tight end go on that long bomb situation it very definitely is you'll see Kilpatrick he actually bumped right into prowl and I think that there was no intent to impede and embarrassed very much think that it could have been ruled either way bills running side by side the roof very clear and there's no intent to impede the receiver it's not passing it very close big break for the Panthers 48 yard game and a first down at the 42 yard line of Syracuse in the second paragraph 914 the plan before just about a yard short one thing that we she know that you've already noticed the previous possession by Pittsburgh they went right down the field passing ran the draw play for the touchdown they had the ball in the old ten yard line leading by 19 the nothing that came right back and threw the bomb got a airfares and they're threatening again Indira's on/off there's no predictability keep the defense off there was a market down back at the 42yard line motion here I was thrown by the lines when I believe stops the clock e24 to go in the first half and cuts off the front teeth bill penalties Lyman down feel on the pass it was a bootleg and official you could see him drop the flag is he watched right down the line and saw the Pittsburgh Pittsburgh linemen crossed the line of scrimmage ruse there's very clearly adopted so the Panthers will come back now to their side of the 50 yard marker EEMA Boris goes into the lineup at guard penalty's about even so fire pit 5 to 55 and see refused to 15 it's a second down situation 26 yards to go on the 43 yard line a Pitt Panthers six of one coming into this game honors this year I'm sure they'd be ranked in the top three very definitely number 75 as he pulled off the line even number 75 wasn't it on the website mix it again the cult coaches worry about those quarterback people hear the singing the noise in a arena like this football and the light would have a humming noise illness what the players say is hard to verbalize and you'll see some motions because 31 yards to go for pit Padilla's be surprised you know they just take that long pass and give them a build on the draw like they do the touch stop so daily for the second inning he hit the game and thumbs up for the beginners up to this pitch turns first mistake we want to watch college run the path where he goes in and come back out and if the last mr. gilpatrick number 19 reading the quarterback for me come on be watch him at the bottom you screen compass it momentarily but he holds on to it for the intercept great flight and here is Warner getting heat Barney goes with the 42 short of the line of scrimmage Boyarsky number 68 fired through there I'll tell you this if Syracuse would go down and punch one in seven the momentum certainly is got to have to go to them Goldman appreciates you good begin to happen to you when you can get the momentum crosses over to the right side shoulder tackle by this senior 275 stop pa let's go down in front 19 to nothing we have 7 minutes and 13 seconds to go in the first half it's enough a Dick Clark great to the star of American Bandstand graduate of Syracuse so all that bring up before Steve Fidel covering 12 so once again Syracuse he sees that tough defense up against him you just haven't got time to move nice kick coming down to Julia's carpet 47yard booth that as far as they're concerned it's still Halloween 19 nothing maybe back in just a moment you would obviously like the score to be a little bit better which again help us feel he's very proud of this new home for the orange man of Syracuse of course you remember coach when Jake was the coach of Dartmouth I remember very very well our ABC crew went there when Dartmouth played Cornell when they had the great Marinero he inspired that team that day and beatable this is a great tribute to he and his and it's painful give the ball with Melanie slices out of bounds at about the 12 yard line we have a fun piece Ferb report very confirmed report that Alabama has been beaten by Mississippi State Alabama the nation's number one team it is confirmed Frank the Crimson Tide have gone down to defeat today hit that again goes to show you what get happened in the crazy game of college Poe Dameron Boulard what a great win probably the no you go to Mississippi State graduation it really is you know Emery was the one that started the wishbone which is elevated Alabama these 10 years to such fantastic phenomenal success and so he does know a little bit about defensive ways bone but to be able to stop the Alabama and win that ballgame is a feat that no one no one in America could ever expect events college football with you we talked about earlier anyway detract from this game or get away from the play here but you just are so estaba it's something like that worthy of more than just a hunch first time for fit about the 22 yard line will have all the scores for you at halftime certainly that's got to be the talk of college football today around the nation we're down to four undefeated untied teams in Division one a right now and now the question will be know what's going to happen who's going to be number one little B UCLA real maybe Georgia sneaked in there but that's what's coming watching Husky Syed was going deep and kill puppet smegal one thing that Chicano and merino both had been doing because they've had great conference in their receiver it's roll the ball up the scrambles on a deep pass this is what Ricardo does he was a safety man he should know better than this because Kilpatrick just laying back watching mr. all the throne quite a bit interception and another opportunity will get false here it's all of the score 19 another the clock has stopped for a timeout we'll be back sure can what's your written estimate mr. Goodwrench wants you to know in advance just about how much the job will cause he has the GM training and tools available NCAA doubleheader starting to probe Easter check vocalist see the games in your area live on it easy jerry Kilpatrick has stolen a couple of foot footballs today has given the arms from new life first antenna who's maintaining up in the first half how much to go can you imagine what it's like in Jackson Mississippi right now so I can't but let's watch you green allamerican three things the offensive man does he controls the block and look at new grain used his hands keep his feet free then once he recognized where the ball Chara's come in he react right through and puts a hit gear on the numbers a great flight here the pit pans view they're saying Huy he is so fast young man that's fine I'm only the coach I know how upset he is his team cannot make any yardage he cannot move the ball with opportunities it's very discouraging well it's third down and 16 to go how did he guess is what they might do gonna protect the paths of the toughest thing because you know almost the line of scrimmage the random oh you dream covering him who is literally everywhere don't forget you know mention a good point about protection for TRC it just goes in there almost at will and by contrast for Cano can stand back there and really compilation protection is the toughest skill for master in the game all coaches recognize and of course this team the block problem America and there's that mismatch you might say is given one a very difficult I spiral coming down and the fair catch called for at the 27 yard line by Troy hill three minutes 41 seconds to go in the first half the Carrier Dome here in Syracuse New York the Panthers are out in front of Syracuse 19 it up they'll run along with Frank Broyles back at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse New York there you see a thank T to nothing with 341 the first half now has a first intent on its own 27 yard line the setups of walking nice defensive reaction and for property incidentally turned him inside my name team to stop it from going outside those of you who are interested in what happened in that Alabama Mississippi State's game David Moore kicked a couple of field goals so this is at the state of the second quarter that in six to three leave then Alabama driving in the closing seconds John Jacobs time quarterback fumbled the ball the Bulldogs recovered and preserved record Mississippi State University right passes car the 47 yard line for one thing that Cano has his pass protection and that is the foundation for successful watch the protection of line of the guards look at their technique Ben Ficano starts and throws steps and throws to the out pattern and Katia comes back and takes a fine catch gets in bounds over before their first down little release out here to the right so tell me Paul who have caught a touchdown pass earlier father yard and a half maybe to two minutes 33 seconds to go in the burg has a builtin twominute offense bill because they are passing team and that's tratamos that's 11 out of 19 124 yards he's getting a good workout pittsburgh has 13 first downs in this first half Jim Collins is that linebacker is really a very fine football player the best defensive plays backing up trying to play the ball watch his reaction come and follow it once the ball is thrown he's got to get McCall number 34 damn they both slipped a little bit but he's able to bring him down about a yard and a half for the Panthers on the 45 yard by Siri no way to catch it 15 surprising it is to me anyway oh he is tough he's got them with big news to look at the thigh zone you know he's a power runner he's a great blocker what a valuable asset Brandon McMillan has been to this 15 that makes it 25 to nothing and Dave Trott will try to make it what he says well yes it does she's gonna get good blocking by 584 and of course McMillan breaks outside 15 Finch was not blocked but he couldn't catch now watch the speed of this big man that's tremendous speed he now runs this free safety aquaplane number 20 in for the touchdown 72 yard drive in five plays and the holy took a minute and 56 seconds to score for the Panthers who now have a rather commanding 2016 other heat and the devil himself has 119 yards today and that comes incidentally on nine carries fine fundamentally my job to me take they have up what he's averaging almost more than a brother thirteen point to the wiki Bernstein thank 145 to go in the first half and the Panthers have a very impressive showing going for them here stalwart defense they played over two mistakes without allowing the score on either at the top of the show we talked about Pittsburgh wanting to get into major bowl to claim one thing has already happened Alabama loss and North Carolina another undefeated team is losing pittsburgh is looking very good there's bull scouts here so they have a chance there's a marker down at the 35 yard line on that kickoff and it may very well be that Pitt was offside on the kick scooby franca yeah well I just saying that Pittsburgh the goal of this football team they are senior beveren seen season Squad they wanted to be in a major bowl ABC News halftime report we'll bring you the latest developments on the situation in Iran and then tomorrow in a special edition of issues and answers Peter Jennings will talk by a satellite to iran's Foreign Minister jokes today at 11:30 Eastern Time followed by our interview with the US Secretary of State Edmund muskie at 12:00 noon Eastern Time special edition of issues and answers over most of these ABC stations we're standing by almost every hour for good news on the hostage situation we hope it's worth coming very soon would it be great if we could get him home right away but you know when you see all that incoming mail Frank good call bill I would not run it out the ball was kicked too high the defensive coverage will right down inside the 20 now to keep their gotten to past the 10 yard better than 45 seconds to go in this first half Syracuse really has not had much in the way of fuel position in this entire first half of that for two miles and then the bill gets his nose in the 25 yard first time reading he's had time to throw and still he had to go to the short man because the coverage of the defensive secondary was sugar well what happens is Pittsburgh's just rushing three men you can see that though all receivers are covered there are big gaps here they can doubleteam both were for all three of their rushes I should say then he has to dump the ball off and Jackson m87 misses before Cadell brings him down Oh deep and went back to the 38 mahalia's pleased about that that's the sixth completion more Syracuse it's very difficult to draw up an offense against pitch Pittsburgh defense this Pittsburgh's in a prevent defense and bill Neal number 66 gets blocked inside opens up the running room bar water but he doesn't want much yard just to get out of bounds to stop the clock thirty seconds to go in the first half he'll play by one of the last play by one I think was the best place mate all day because the Pittsburgh had the rush they had the Blitz and he recognized it and he saw just the opening inside he broke through for the first down very fine play on his part Frank Maloney talking to him Frank sit his 7th year here at Syracuse University I remember him very well he was an outstanding guard at Michigan under bump Eliot in the early 60s he had planned to go to law school actually and was in his first year at Northwestern University as a lawyer intended to be lawyer I know something happened he just decided he had to get back into football he he went back to Mount Carmel High School where he'd been a prep star in Chicago and all he did was just set all kinds of records at Mount Carmel as a coach and then he went back to Michigan as an assistant and finally worked his way up at Syracuse University and although we had I think a graphic little earlier it was and 13 that has been stated fit the two biggest rivals it looks like it's gonna be all in 14 they two years and he's got some great question difficult somebody put an extra in there stops the clock 23 seconds to go in this first half Pittsburgh out of front 26 nothing will be running out all of the scores is behalf of here at half time but again let me remind you that Alabama went down to defeat today Mississippi State Bulldogs go green are we going to go back and watch you bringing what's the password watch number 99 all two years in the road since again this year actually is dropping off momentarily now let's see what he does all of a sudden he wants to go back to play and then someone else cause the penalty let's watch it again Paul that you you see Hugh guess Paul that hit gear in on the numbers what a great player he is I see what happened one of the Pitts players thought there was a late blocking hit on the part of Syracuse and as the Syracuse player went down there looked like the Pitt player just gave him a little me right there ripped and it was detected by the official as unnecessary roughness in a personal foul and so it makes it first down for the orange man 23 seconds to go in the first half I believe this is the deepest penetration they've had 35 yard line very definitely and they've got a chance to throw for the end zone I guess bill I would expect the Pittsburgh to blitz and try to pick him up man for man and fire tackle wanna for a loss and they've had luck with it they have to accuser has not solved the problem of past protection hadn't found the remedy yet wide to the right is Mike Dombrowski stops the clock with 17 seconds to go in the first half with a pitch he made in traffic wondered if he plucked it again water makes a good throw he's throwing over the linebackers head he has to drop it in and you can see that these want to get hit by Flynn and Dwight Marcus Marcus Hackett was the receiver on that one and Paulson Buda was the receiver here 10 sec well bill they've got to throw it across the goal line I've got the Troy quick and throw it I've had somewhere inside of 100 and got much chance ten seconds left the boy first hang yes I'm sorry 10 seconds to go in this first half I feel a sensational kick your be on the sidelines as we look at it again was able to concentrate pull the pass in is an excellent drove my water throw back to the far sideline and look at the ball good pikes barrel jumps up holds it falls on the 2yard very clear legal completion pointed out to him Pittsburgh has not a lot of touchdown on the this year in seven game now the ball is in the oneyard line three seconds to go given this set of circumstances remember they couldn't make the first down in a store against Pittsburgh and that was in the festival a year ago on a oneyard run well I say it would be fitting if Little Joe Morris to punch it in there the greatest winner in Syracuse history number 47 and those emotions try to spread the defense they don't even react to absolutely super cold this to your foot the dorm has gone bologna says go for two all logic most of government one across the mouth Oh and emotion had three receivers to the left No the clock ahead of the ball care to the right right hand side for the touchdown sure on the touchdown it's the option to play for Jesus from penetrating right here then has enough room to jump duck inside before since even while dining out against Green watch the green is trying to take the pitch and the quarter back low penetration time Isner 86 green comes back in but he could not been out a touchdown by water justifying the individual effort so it is 26 to 6 have you heard the roar that the orange band got we'll be back with today's halftime activities right after this word from our local state watch the right guard holy crap actually they pried open just a little hole no one knew that he had the ball but the safety man Flynn made the backer and he was the last person to prevent effective first time how about a prime beef hold it to the right you see building over momentarily before the bridal party dilaloo turn found field finally knocked out of bounds software the freshman first down and it's in Pitt territory recovered the 49yard line now he did that as a matter of fact in the game last week the most unusual play unless you look at home look at it again you're gonna see wanna raise the ball up the throw and somehow I slipped right out of his hand the ball goes back behind him and then goes fault in the rule is if the ball is not forward it's a fumble even though it slips out I guess this official reeled that is it official therefore was an incomplete cranks two weeks it really is you must have a very small hand the big hand that you need to have a good firm grip on the ball second and 10 the ball is at the 49 app it draws blasting through there is Horace about the 45 here's South Sunseri that we climb back there junior and we got Steve Fidel who's back after a couple drinks out with a virus problem Williamson is a senior at strong safety then Terry White a senior has a cornerback then Thomas also a senior at it's 8d where tratado used to be a freshman Tom flail Jilla book crosses over to the far side big play here for Syracuse water originally Williams once now well at least with this field position at the 47 in fit territory Jim good will the farmer has an opportunity to pin the Panthers back good field position about to get pittsburgh to make a mistake oh they're gonna fake it penalty Marty well I believe that Pittsburgh recovered it and I think it's a clipping penalty on Syracuse and therefore the ball will go over to Pittsburgh at this spot they'll refuse the penalty telephone was falling he was sure that the first toppity fumbled the ball forward pittsburgh recovered it at the 35 yard line and the penalty was in fact against the orange man of Syracuse so they'll go back on defense Tom Vick Panthers number 29 there was then shot first down 4/5 13 minutes to go to 34 engi player on the left side pulling the defensive player off Frank mentioned a little bit earlier that you do hear sort of a buzz sound in this Carrier Dome and that's it's caused the family by the huge like there's the fennel leaf shocked off against Pittsburgh back to the 30 the same thing happens in Astrodome and also in the Superdome I've talked to the coaches in Arkansas played last week against Houston had four five penalties but they couldn't hear the quarterback snap can stream strange sensations to here twenty six to six is the score pit out in front third quarter the Panthers have the dog would call his stop good defensive move he only got about three yards by Craig Bingham outside linebacker you know McCall did not start thinking against Boston College rank in the game that we covered earlier that he came on strong and in his approach you have to bring a freshman even though he's very talented long very slowly so he doesn't get discouraged and make mistakes and Pittsburgh's playing for the national championship that's what their goal was so they wanted to break him in and not rush it and that's the fastest Ricardo getting some heat Jimmy Kimmel comes in for nothing now Jamie Kimmel starting his first game is a first to the defensive end now we've got a good look at the defenders and on the opposite side of Colonel Mike Charles grit her but ski what ski goes to 21 of the lightest men on the defense and Jamie Kimmel we just made the stop Tom Siebert in place of zoom ik was a starter today Jim Collins perhaps the best defensive player middle linebacker third and 15 and Ficano in the pocket Rose Ron it is almost intercepted boy coming close with Cedric Hinton there is a biggie or because he refused actually looks better it's offensive thrust after taking the kickoff then fit it after getting the ball hot refill and Kimmel sacked of Chicago is the first one since the opening game of the season against Boston College so that's quite a feat a couple of first today huh yes sir he's been averaging 29 yards in this game kicks it or there's a vicious tackle as koban is cut down at the 37 yard line and that's where Syracuse will have the ball when we return number one right now Arizona is leading second ranked UCLA by four and touchdown the Arizona honey what's the ball John McCallum was doing there but he did a little backward dance the best block and missed the call thinking that snap was all the quick count let's look at this fast and I think we can see that Pittsburgh still is has a big decisive lead in first downs commanding rushing convincing in passing over whelming in total ternal was the same and a little bit more respective as far as respectable and time of possession is Syracuse at 11 the pittsburgh 17 but still overwhelmingly Pittsburgh faithful saw its first 15 on procedure penalty 11:36 to go the third quarter bit out in front 26 6 bought Syracuse has come to life here in the closing moments of the first half and in this second half what does this quickly doesn't wonder saw that both of his receivers were absolutely blanket you know it's interesting about you green as we look at him you know he really wasn't recruited primarily by the Panthers actually rooster Jones was the man they were after in that shows Mississippi but film came up and you know at all if you happened to see hey who is that guy that happens sometimes and Horace green has been a great football player and he has the ability to rush as he did on that play equal to lenient in country meister got his head big paw on that ball and knocked it down six fourandahalf 250 so he's got good size for a tackle and he has good speed bill he was a tight in at one time and they've moved to defensive tackle one thing the water has not had as much pass protection 11 yards for little Joe Morrow's today averaging 162 again what's it right in there to joke short of the first down though he has to go all the way down with a forty eight six and a half yard line and this will bring up the fourth come on the 35 once again turkey was in long yardage situation build one thing to try to avoid at all cost against Pittsburgh defense they're too quick and have too much ability to rush when you have to throw the ball Jim goodwill back to punt good highest Faro and Saric is is down quickly on first of all rather the last sucker I'm pursued after that good hi hun 24second hang time today Phil and what great coverage prank bingo mez was down and made a great play to force the Dolphins for the night yeah a good reminder here at 9 o'clock Eastern on Monday night the berries there in the brown be a good match up there as the Browns are coming off that tremendous victory over the Steelers and the Bears have wall to paper with great fault two years wall in the 9 yard line handoff goes to McCollum healed almost in there they're still getting some pursuit that runs well the Syracuse villains have not had a great deal to cheer about but they have been very vocal here starting from the end of the first half when Syracuse got on the board they can't help but to just inspire you all the builds are very deadly bill and you can see the difference in their fare to use play there's something about the fan and support the momentum increases that enthusiasm and something good what happens for you second and 12 took out a Boeing beef to the end zone looks downfield sucks his head and goes out for office perhaps Syracuse feels after hearing that Alabama the number one seat of elation was upset today by Mississippi State said shucks anything can happen after all they wouldn't Eliab in there today departments always coming they feel that college football today is a lifeanddeath struggle every week and the force s fine for the favors exciting but it's tough on us old coaches on Feb 3rd down and the big sign says hold of Hold'em the big electric scoreboard side 39 wool slashing through there for the first down and very quickly getting it his Randy McClellan brought down by our cocaine say McClellan has been the difference today he has just been tremendous we're gonna look at from behind the beef this look at the pig split of the guards and you're gonna see how this just the wigs play right up at middle with grim number 75684 through the side and giving McMillan a chance to break in the secondary alkyl pain number 20 making the choir big first down for the Panthers 859 to go the third quarter and Pitt is on her foot 26 to 6 on the pig drop kakano fires it to Benji fryer out of about the 35 one thing that's impressive about the Pittsburgh team is that they'll throw from anywhere on the field they share the old goal and they have competent bucardo they have confidence in their receivers they believe that they have great pass blockers giving Ginza quarterback plenty of time and so they use their weapons and I think they're to be commended for it bill eight minutes 25 seconds to go third quarter hit out in front with the ball now and the score twenty six to six it's second down and about three at the 31 yard line in fifth territory that's down about this one as they throw the streams and Macmillan well let him get loose very far he's gone as we've seen twice today Siebert decks him at the 35 incidentally we're going to have the highlights of that Mississippi State Alabama game on college football 80 so check your listings for that game well the most of these ABC stations stream was a good call on that circumstance Takano did a good job of setting it up and with no one but he's tough he's you said Bill gets an open field already thrown 23 times today and here's number 24 and it's great through the arms of Benji fryer covering was Greg Bingham and that means it's a second down situation in Tennessee 35yard line of Pittsburgh there's Tucanos stats for the first two and a half quarters fourteen completions 24 attempt for a youngster who was playing safety man two weeks ago and then literally in the middle of the game switched over and played offensive quarterback and that's birth is 6 and 1 on the season Syracuse for and pray stop on Wayne DeBartolo by Craig Bingham number 57 coaches have a warm place in their heart for Craig venom bill he's a aggressive youngster he can run a for 600 he's not very big just 200 pounds but he has a attitude of that nonstop allout intense effort that was a good indication of it as he tackled the park deeper tarlowe third down on 11 fussing pattern and it is incomplete good defensive play by Cedric hit mom it brings up this look at just the end of the play as very talented offensive the quarterback is ripe old pop of Colin's it would have required a perfect throw at an outstanding catch but it was really a fine defense it's right on center can't remember 18 endoverend coming down to koban after 30 bucks his head and his snowed under at the 34 yard line 37 yard 649 to go the third quarter Syracuse gets the ball on their own 33 yard line trailing 26 six with about six minutes to go the Wildcats of Arizona are still points already we've seen Alabama defeated number one team in the number two team is trailing illegal now let's take a check on some of the other stores juice okay to Georgia Tech today 17 to 12 Clemson to the close went over Wake Forest 35 with 33 Virginia Tech in the fourth quarter over West Virginia Mountaineers of Michigan overwhelmed Indiana 35 to nothing at Bloomington 52 to 31 while the Wildcats had quite an offensive pumps there today 18 situation on the draw Joe Morris tries to go on the side new clues after a huge e but it doesn't get a chance as he is sliced from underneath by Terry White number 23 Manasota in a close one over Illinois 21 to 18 big win for the Gophers in Iowa bounces back 20 to the 13 over Wisconsin Kansas over Kansas State a great rivalry there look at this Texas Tech a three and three team on the season against Texas a five on one team and they're out in front 24 to 20 indeed the weekend of upsets of 1980 order pouring of sensational paste and bamboo SOPA holding onto it right in heavy traffic running to the lap what's close to do tough to do and you can see them dude always gonna run for the first down white and Ricky Jackson in on the play first um and going nowhere is fullback in Mandeville as Hugh greens is there with the salting time now quick check on other scores SMU out in front of Texas A&amp;M another one of our regional games here on ABC oh look at this San Jose State out over Baylor twenty three to twenty two in the fourth quarter and fader gets away from Southwest Conference play not a good situation in Colorado another big surprise Frank over Iowa State Bank nice to win one Donnie bill second and tannin Warner is quick down he goes as for ER ski 275 pounds see your middle bars every time we put stories up we seem to the thoroughly surprised today continues to move great offensive team third down situation 15 to go as Syracuse there's Stanford I'm fond of Oregon State thirty three to six that's a half time ago see Russia's on once again long yardage I keep harping on this but somehow to avoid long yardage because the two hints Jackson and green just lay their ears back in here they come and no one can protect fall bit too quick too strong i floating kick coming down to about the 16 yard behind at stake Jarius Dawkins comes to the sidelines up to the 25 go to the 35:42 there is a mother mile marker was screwed in there too late to see 43yard okay well there was a lady neither he signaled the referees signal clip let's see I didn't see if that's what it is but I mean couldn't pick up who loves teams have talked Wow shall not clipon punt returns there's a very damaging penalty to the 27 yard line three minutes and 46 seconds to go in this third floor and pit is out in front 26 to 6 be friendly the Syracuse tea was plated if not even maybe even a little better in the third quarter there's been no scoring in it a great deal Sookie's is a different ball this hang it's all coming up alongside of McMillan who blasts in for a couple of yards to about the 31 yard line like sunic number 48 brought it down along with Jimmy Collins he's been outstanding there's a new gardener 33 I think it's going to be interesting well jackie sherrill the coach to pittsburgh changes strategy Billy's been : practically every town from anywhere appeal maybe settle down and run the ball well he told me this quote of all he has followed the host earlier game plans but that one's been outstanding here's a letter 36 yards in 11 carries that two interceptions today have not lost they fumble as such every fall yeah let's look at that fumble again real quickly come battle the field you can see that Macmillan had already gone for those four played before Cecotto could get the ball to it and then the condom made an errand posted to him the hill and look lucky to get it back two minutes 35 seconds to go third quarter straight back he goes on a third and eleven situation nice play friends right at the 41yard line Benji park going on the sidelines two runs of a game nothing one pass first now that's advantage of being able to throw so proficiently kakano 15 out of 26 for 158 yards and one touchdown I'm sure you're sitting at home and you're saying you need to tell me this guy has not been their starting quarterback gives you a rough idea of what they think of me Marino very definitely this of course given chicano credit because having worked on defense all spring all September ice the Hualien is how much had he worked the quarterback he said only on Monday bill once a week and then he would go over and play safety man the rest of the time and there's Dan Marino number 13 a very talented sophomore quarterback and bear his numbers all the year he was injured two weeks ago those deep past approach is incomplete intended for Collins bill that's number 10 DJ Kavanagh the great Paul America met Kavanagh who's playing for New England right now younger brother it looks like he's gonna be ready in a couple years that was good good size he's like Matt Matt Kavanagh had one of the greatest games I've ever seen of a college quarterback in the Gator Bowl against Clemson a couple years ago well think of this season when he got hurt against Notre Dame what if you have coulda made they're down there did 10 158 to go third quarter Chicanos hips another from this vantage point the roof very clearly says and you at home judge that the receiver all the defense's that can get territorial rights that means if he is those right he's got the rights in the defensive back do not touch him before the ball gets through the receiver he had territorial rights in my opinion it was a good call first down that's the 36 yard line for Pittsburgh 80 first down this is as deep as they have been territory played them tough no scoring at all here in the third and here's the call slashing through to the 26 yard line and almost a first down it's not a first down very close to 10 yards Mike sunic brought him down one thing about a team that can throw and run they keep the defense off the balance that's the name of the game today is to keep the defense unsure in their minds whether it's gonna be Iran oh pass we're gonna have a measurement to see if it is the first down but Pittsburgh is very adept it mixes up the drawl the screen and the pass and occasional run the point that Syracuse has little opportunity to stop a couple of inches headed 38 seconds to go in the third quarter and bits out in front 26 to 6 the arms man now hoping to stop them from getting on that scoreboard again before Syracuse can score jackie sherrill in his fourth year as head coach of the Panthers certainly as the greatest defensive team in Pitt history it's not that either feel I'd love the head I'm in think of many years I'd love to have a theme like this just dumping it off the center and spinning around there is Mike Dombrowski about Mike's not very far from home Buffalo and it'll be a first down and it is right on the 10yard line less than two minutes to go in the Arizona UCLA game and Arizona is on the verge of another big upset earlier today Mississippi State stung number one ranked Alabama six to three and UCLA is trailing Arizona with two minutes to go and Oklahoma defeated North Carolina 41 to 7 another undefeated team Texas Tech is beating Texas getting close to the 5yard line as Joe McCall on the set mock movies 1:10 to go third quarter next week we'll play Louisville at home and then the last two games of the Panthers will be away at army and of course the big one on the 28th of November at Penn State I have a feeling now with Penn State improving every week that that could be quite some time to think is it you see it on McMillon down certainly smelled it out actually the owner there's young Craig bring him again bill and I talked about it earlier but the coaches say that he they call him a coaches player he just does everything with all our effort fine young for a young man like katana who's been overall defense he recognized the Flitz the man for man coverage he knew that Kali recognized it also going right down bound you throw it up high and hope he can outjump the defensive back good effort by the defensive backs bitch to keep it from being a completion three seconds to go third quarter and here is Dave trout to try for his third field goal that's good and the six on that 26yard field goal and pittsburgh has gotten only three points here in this third quarter Syracuse eight within three seconds really of shutting about Arizona will then get the ball back on the free kick so it looks like another big upsets the nation's top two college teams going down a defeat today Alabama being defeated by Mississippi State and Arizona defeating UCLA at least if it continues that way for the next 60 seconds or so we'll keep you uptodate and we understand that bigger number jothee they're playing San Jose State away from the conference game so now we begin this fourth period kid is out in front 29 to 6 over Syracuse with the game pretty well in hand almost completely today he gets over y'all so strong against the slow pipe of offense for the tailback has fined up 7 y rd bears nuff said San Jose State Doc Elway the coach a great victory for him Baylin was undefeated Savonarola for the first time built in the history of their institution 81 years I've ever got position of seven and over seven what 28 yard line and Texas today 24 to 20 that's just gonna say the same thing Arkansas has got a tough one tonight against Rice playing without their starting quarterback and so upset seen as you said there could be massacre Saturday Jones still oh damn John just feel hurt yes yes not skin Mandeville down at the 33 yard line go take a look at the stats and of course they're still hobo wealthy and growing but the one thing I want to point out looking Russian 19 yards and when you have an absence of ability to move the ball again Oklahoma I'll guess the Pittsburgh on the ground you're in I mean 162 yards is what John Morris had coming in now the reason you don't see rows at the top of the staff list and Marcus Allen of USC is there is simply because the NCAA has a method of determining the top rushes you have to play in 75 percent of the games that have been played Morris sat out pregame so that's the reason he's not up there but we still can't deny the statistic yartsa game is good and anything against anybody Pittsburgh a really outstanding clothes like that let's watch it yeah you're gonna see the difference really what makes the difference of a great football player is his quickness to move once he wants to go somewhere Ricky Jackson is coming from behind but you going to see green like he'll hit him and and that could be a shoulder crank kind of hit you get with those dislocations with two defensive end Ricky Jackson just was out nearly as outstanding as Hugh Grant let's watch Ricky Jackson and just see exactly how he does come all the way across he's lined up on the opposite side of the point he recognizes the playing news he comes in and helps on the play from with Hugh green new quarterback Jeff Fisher rookies had a couple of times and said wow what happened by the fullback the defense get a chance I guess to see the rush by Pittsburgh just watch how quickly off and the quarterback just has no chance for sensational block by then the hill then the core species trying to get outside and Greg Myers in the 86 place before toriel were 22 twenty nine to six wheel falls for this message and we'll be right back they've one of the quarterbacks starting today for Syracuse blinking a little bit extra and moving his head around as if he's trying to shake off that rat a crushing tackle put on by Ricky Jackson the new green to develop a menace nagging he's down at the 41 yard line you know before we begin today's game we made a comment Pittsburgh was going to need help in getting to a major bowl they're definitely building beef and they have gotten the help today with Alabama losing UCLA across with beef not to be affected by that cause they're barred from the bowl but then North Carolina was another undefeated team that's got beaten and USC cannot go so Pittsburgh can move up and have them very much an outside chance of come in before they play Penn State what Jimmy Caan's makes the stop on Joe McCall clock moving 10:59 to go in this game yeah as Pittsburgh has been very convincing today over a Syracuse team that has been very gritty I agree with your house to solve it though in the top twenty by one dimension we have five teams the top 20 have lost today and if you see a white losses that would be the sickroom so far or 200 yards today by the way and here's another surprise coming up Texas has been defeated by Texas Tech Texas dicks Texas was in one of the Southwest Conference race and Texas Tech one in two Ollie Bale is still undefeated in conference board first in channel there 46 yard line and pecan oh look some clothes deep plecos a perfectly thrown football splitting the two defenders before yard indication of the speed of light Collins and the farm of Chicago you can see you've got to throw it quick because he's going back across the grain he lets it go as far as he can and collars just outrun driving number 21 and the free safety are cocaine was should have been back he won and another touchdown for Collins and another extra points for Dave trout and that just does put the game out of reach without any shadow of a doubt thirty seven to six so Pittsburgh with ten minutes and four seconds to go in the ballgame has increased Philly thirtysix the six as Pittsburgh is out of fun of Syracuse now and we do have a final on that Arizona game and the Wildcats did it they upset in UCLA 23 to 17 saw again the nation's number one and number two teams you see la that means number three more days today well be the top team in the nation both an finally runs it out that gets it to the amount six times he stood there that end zone with those long high booming kicks this time he decided to take it I'd have been hurt pointing to his knee left foot like that it's not serious let's see if we can see exactly what happened we can say that the knees buckled right undream and he is in pain there's no doubt about you've been tearing off the field we hope that is not serious well they'll slap some ice on that very very quickly to keep that swelling down and hope that it isn't any deep damage so the ball is pleased over the yard line where Syracuse will have it Dave Warner who was locked a little bit goopy there for a moment earlier by green and Ricky Jackson he's back in the lineup there's the man who did it Blake Collins and he for a freshman just is unbelievable that was a sick privacy but he's basically a running back in the booth I am after the third game was called three 486 y'all here's another hometown of the rather famous former Pittsburgh player Tony Dorsett Pennsylvania well I believe he played at the same house till name became obedient policy another player down on the artificial surface now you've won a corner again and going into the lineup now as his backup Jeff Fischer all in all I would have to think bill that Jackie's girl is pleased with the performance of his team so far in this ball game his defense is been outstanding his offensive end when they get to they've really come through and they're taking a good look at that left ankle of Idi koban was not the need so we'll be back in just a moment
