============================================================

they think is the best and for more on that let's go to the field and check in with a injury well they were all in one future halloffamer over another stdm told me we're talking Rembrandt and Bango there's no way I choose voted for men and two and a half for Brady Terry Bradshaw and John Elway is revered pretty because of the rig's is position and is more than that came from Santa playing the role of Switzerland you sit and held his feet to the fire and said okay who starts in overtime I wish you two been in Switzerland when I play East Stephan vistas key to kickoff New England won the toss elected to defer the ball bill belichick 10th season the coach Brad this house keys dick Manning and company going to work and let's take a look at the Indy starters Peyton Manning University of Tennessee Joseph Addai he then state Reggie Wayne do you Pierre gar√ßon mountain mean Dallas Clark University of Iowa Geno Robinson Missouri Western State University Charlie Johnson Oklahoma State Brian lilja Kansas State Jeff Saturday North Carolina at Chapel Hill proud of an Oregon State University with brian beam northern illinois Peyton Manning making fifth consecutive starts dog as his first game and hasn't missed the start since both declined for yard line Joseph Addai fix it up to the 27 yard line for Manning he was the MVP of the league last year but in a way he's kind of where Brady was at this time last year remember he had the bursa sac problem didn't play in preseason that took a while to get started there's very mediocre through the first seven weeks the team is 3 &amp; 4 and then blazing hot down the stretch to finish nine and all second down at six but the pass is a short one for a minimal gain Gene Robinson makes the catch let's take a look at the favorite starters my brightness Cincinnati Vince Wilfork University my direct purchase homeless Carey Guyton Georgia Tech dry male tendency to leave at Duquesne University of California Jonathan will hide all Brandon Meriweather proud father Morgan here with Brandon McGowan the you of mein Leben Duquesne University there is Butler Yukon as if to give us time to introduce the defense Indianapolis want to do a rare huddle third down and six it will be three and out on the pass intended for Pierre Garcon Gary Gaytan in on the coverage and you took a look at that New England defense among others tonight they're missing Ty Warren who was a late scratch because of an ankle injury you're gonna see gar son come out and around here on the inside this is a bit of a matchup they played three different coverages on all three snaps there so the game has already started for Bill Belichick and Peyton Manning Pat McAfee is the looking puncher drafted to the seventh round out of West Virginia west from his things we packed up to the let's take a look at the New England's Tom Brady mission Laurence Moroney high school Randy Moss brand University Plus Welker Texas Tech Benjamin Watson Georgia Chris Baker Michigan State Sebastian Balma University of Houston Logan Menken's Fresno State Dan Connaughton Southeast Missouri Stephen L cos theta Nick Kaiser University of Toledo unlocked he was shaken last week but he is in the lineup infowar is the pass is caught on the Moss to the 36yard line he's tackled by the rookie Jacob Lacey for Tom Brady first quarter first game last year Bernard Pollard of Kansas City rolls into his knee and the next thing you know he's on an operating table and the Patriots not happy that he had a surgery on the west coast and he had a staph infection too dude after that the Tom Taylor's last by he feel he said the only thing the last thing to have come back for him is his energy everything else structurally and physically he said his terrific second short as we take a look at the Pope defensive starters while the Memphis Eastside Magna high school Antonio Johnson he's City State Daniel Miller Kent State Dwight Freeney say filled with Georgia Gary bracket inception whisperer Jacob Lacey name building bully named Horace high school Anton Badou to the mecca how universe Jerrod powers called yet these two teams are one two in fewest points allowed the season and that pass is incomplete seemi Silva covering on the play Benjamin Watson was the intended receiver and so each team starts with a three enough any time you don't see help on Dwight Freeney coming off the edge here you know Tom Brady is gonna get that thing out of there in a hurry so almost a tipoff from the stars you don't see help on Freeney you know it's going to be about a two second throw by Tom Brady Chris Hansen is the punter that TJ rushing is back the Colts for a fair catch at the 10yard line so a 3 and a 4 inside Indianapolis and New England from Indiana Sunday night football brought to you by Southwest Airlines go to Southwest comm grab your bag it's on in engineering by Sprint official wireless service sponsor of the NFL and by Coors Light when the mountainous turn green as cold as the Rockies some scenes from this great rivalry which really of course got got heated up after Tom Brady became the starting quarterback in New England who bled so much started the decade and then Brady comes on the teeth door says be here throughout he's nothing on overall pick in the draft in 1998 ten yard line makes his 61st packs of the season first down he breaks out of a Brandon McGowan tackle a 25 yard game like this one very much any time you give Dallas Clark a free release you are asking for Trenton it down the middle of the field that has been the game plan of the Patriots in past years hit him and hit him again that they mess against a Maryland defense that what else is new will show Manning every look in the books tonight Chris one thing he's had to do is is mixandmatch five regular starters from last season are gone try Warren is gone tonight with an ankle injury Jarvis Green was already hurt and of course at the beginning of the season they sent Richard Seymour to Oakland well the good news though is they're playing the Colts tonight so basically they've been playing a nickel with only two down linemen in the game that being Vince Wilfork and Mike Wright both essentially knows towers she's made getting position he got in front of lead who has come over to the coats after several years in Cleveland and then last year in Detroit and was able to reach back toward Manning and make the grab first down one of the things we talked to Peyton Manning about was the idea that he knew they were going to take away Reggie Wayne knew they were going to try and take away Dallas Clark he really felt like the Pierre Garcon maybe position to have a big night the 27 is ready but it's good for 25 on a great brand by number 87 Jonathan can I have better coverage than that and Peyton went up and quick snapped it and there's a whistle and is also I think going to be a challenge before he could snap at Belichick was right there Scott great history religion the ruling on the field that it was a completed pass there's one thing that nohuddle does is it doesn't allow you to talk to the guys upstairs the assistant OSHA's you just have to make the call pretty much on your we think the ruling on the field is going to be a getting both feet in 3:30 then there's one he drank the right foot as he has control right there and then just for good measure that foot is also we think in that it won't matter though he's what Scott Greene is going to see is that angle and this one as well after hearing the play and again Christmas one of those things where normally if they ran a normal offense normal pacing the assistant coaches upstairs to take a look at it that challenge had to be made on the sidelines by Belichick you know by the seat of his pants he cause Peyton Manning got him to the line of scrimmage and quick snap the ball he forced his hand first out 26 yard line is his 10 that's gonna be good for but Dallas Clark he's covered by the rookie safety out of Oregon PacSun first down folks willow pressure here and Derrick Burgess gets pressure around the corner as well Bill Belichick Callahan you can't Blitzen and be successful in paid to just confirmed what Bill Belichick God when there's really not have a running game to speak of right now 3.7 is the team average and for a die who was a firstround pick back in oh six his average this season three point four league average is always 4.0 4.1 my goodness Vince Wilfork just took Jeff Saturday and just planted him on the seat of his pants righthanded Josefa God 16:53 25 Saturday gives you long about 25 pounds second in the living complete the aircar saw was the intended receiver Bawden covering on the plate will be third down and 11 well they're doubling the inside receivers now bill belichick is down here in the red zone and pierre garcon on the outside has man coverage he has to be able to win this battle they're basically giving him an opportunity they're doubling Reggie Wayne right here but they're singling up on the outside and that's one he just has to win the drive would not that time third and 11 his bunched three receivers to the right Clark is to the left Manning will shut up a stream and they go and plays to take the lead paetynn is just going to fake a screen out to the come back at crosses Joseph Addai works back underneath beautifully blocked and I terror for the Colts that's what works when these receivers get down the field and get some blocks at time Dallas Park with the differencemaker they ran it twice for three yards they have some indoor fireworks here don't get me started on fireworks in in Stadium next for the extra point that's good Colts offenses on fire 8:19 remaining in the first quarter seven to nothing Indianapolis good way to enhance the experience of son school defense will come out Chris talking about if there's one key to the game it's the pressure that the defensive ends can put on and that is the key to a lot of games against the Colts 10 training in Mathis bring the heat and very often they do meanwhile totally ban takane is down so the patriot defense already ty warren elite scratch and now Fanta Kane is on the turf J will from over that show any time for some green we're talking about grainy since Oh two sacks fumble which is a worst thing in a quarterback's lexicon when two of them have combined for 56 first down what was at the 27yard line and doing his thing for 11 years with the Patriots short gain here to be second down and 7 and their silly fan to Kane who is a linebacker starter and also on special teams as well who took a shot on that run back and he's probably their best bilis it going over things with that defense which watch the coats san aiken is in the game he's one three receiver the bailiffs handed after but he boats would be a first half of a Steve and Neil block but he is a little bit short of it they'll spot the ball at the thirty six and a half it's going to make a third down and inches van cop√°n and Steven meal right best interior play starting to see right now the Patriots trying to establish a running game all have to deal with and it's great he will keep it himself and lunge ahead with a good thrust to the 40yard line and that will be a first down Jim Carlo was the anointed one they talked about him replacing Tony Dungy whenever it was that Tony was going to retire that had been the case for over the only fryer hit coasting experience is when he was the head coach at Wake Forest they get fired in 2000 and was trying to get a job for one of his assistants and he called Tony Dungy who is a tampa and cold winds up getting a job on Tony staff and then comes de Indianapolis but Tony came here and I too radiography and with Phillip trying to take him down until it gets to the six yard line perfect pass hold in the middle threads the needle in stride 55 yards first and goal all those running plays set up this linebackers they're now stepping up on the playaction fake and you're able to get Randy Moss with a free release right down the middle I'm gonna suggest that's not a great idea for the future I've had success against Randy Moss they get somebody on this when he gets he swings really take it to the twitch session they've been running back by committee in the winter this season for the most part of course Fred Taylor was brought in from Jacksonville got hurt Maroni and he's been a disappointment to a degree through his career number one draft version thought he'd be better by now and he understands that his average right now four point three but he is an opportunity with all of the injuries Sammy Morris and Fred Taylor who really shine chance closer to five yards of care second and goal into the end zone he goes for the touchdown so a 90yard Indianapolis drive is answered very quickly in a three and a half minute 73 yard drive by the New England Patriots an extra point away from tying the game they bring in an extra offensive lineman over here Marc love war and he just gets the doubleteam and gets him in and when Lawrence from Maroney talking to him last night he said I'm tired of all the suggestions I'm going back to what I know about running the football and really much tougher lately the staff speed after each team goes three and out each team with a long touchdown drive that's more like it 447 left to the quarter 7/7 right here on NBC what you got for that to be a Raider fan chad simpson will down it there and was for 47 to go peyton manning coming back and of course the big play on that drive was the past moss so he talked about what happens when you establish your run watch carry bracket hesitate for just a moment here on this playaction fake gonna step up and now you have not a tight end but Randy Moss running behind you and he simply couldn't get in the hole against that cover to defense Donald Brown comes into the game Brown was their number one draft choice hurt his shoulder a couple of weeks ago so he has been enacted for the last couple of games rod mink of it she's now going to play the outside linebacker spot normally occupied by totally Fanta came setting up in first out the inside linebackers Gary Dyke meanwhile let's go back to Joseph a dime we've heard his hand or fingers on the touchdown play watch the off the right hand and he gets a tangle left with brains and McGowan and he went from the bench back to the locker room so that's why Brown is in at the one at the 36 yard line taken down by the lead well he just came back to let Bo down index and middle finger on his right hand are taped together over his gloves at least they do have Donald Brown in there as you mentioned remember though he missed the past two games with a sprained left shoulder right and ironically it was a dye burning his hand on a reception because it was after the reception is he got hit at the goal line and it is touchdown of the night a 15 yard pass boys who is on second down and nine Kali working at a BYU drafted in the fourth round who's already made a big mark Darius Butler a rookie from Connecticut makes the tackle now let's look at the changeup here Gary Gaytan the linebacker is going to come up on Dallas Clark and bump and run coverage as they go back to the no huddle offense down and seven from the 39 year probably most of the inside trying to get it out to brown he was covered by Jerrod Mayo and Myron Pryor the rookie lineman out of Kentucky is the guy that time who put the heat on Manning for behind ya filling in for Tully Panther Kane's gonna come around here and get some pressure this is exactly what they were trying to do by starting Derrick Burgess in this game trying to get a little additional pressure and that time Minka Fitch got there here's McAfee now to punt hundreds MIT now two touchdowns one run and and Wes Welker brings it back to the 29 after a short kick 42yard mood 10yard return 3:07 remaining in the quarter game tied at 7 themes of the decade the decades drawing to a close most regular season wins the Colts 109 in the past 108 12 or more games that folks have won over the last six seasons going on a seven look at the Patriots for that perfect rake of the season and the Patriots for those 3 Super Bowl wins and the Colts with one so three rings for Belichick 20 Dungey one the oh easy with man this game time 700 first contend with three minutes to play in the quarter in the bowl of the 29 the outside free and buffet is back there and Malthus goes all the way back down the field to run them down there for a game of twenty nine but one of the problems that you're gonna have here you've got draw powers a corner coming up here and trying to make this play because of all the receivers on the field it forces the Colts to go into this nickelanddime defense but watch Robert Mathis you talk about how much this defense hustles how many defensive end Jenner see him do that first and ten Brady by jakub laces it'll be second down to 10 to 20 remaining in the quarter sebastian Bomer is the new starter has left tackle for the Patriots and I don't think that Dwight Freeney thought one time during the course of this game that he would see oneonone protection on the outside but Ballmer who has played very very well format light did a great job there the just activated Isiah stand back thumbs into the game quarterback at watch over when a multidose second round choices for the Patriots in the and he goes next to lower at the 40yard line its powers again in on the action coming up to the line of scrimmage to stop him drive powers the rookie cornerback just got his revenge on now don't foul it jack got him on the last powers got his good protection and then a great match at the 21yard going to the outside getting position on buffet and a 20yard gain in the first battle for third and long break Tom Brady with a pump fake right here is going to pump to the outside and freeze this corner back right here so that he can't fall back underneath Randy Moss great play by Brady and puddle is it is Brady and I think he goes nohuddle they're thinking that that that play was close enough on the sidelines that they wanted to avoid a challenge a potential challenge on the moss catch that was losses third catches so Brady goes to the line of scrimmage as if to indicate hey we don't want to give them time to think about this and overturn it second out of nine gravy with three completions tonight in five attempts all three to moss the inside handle to Kevin for holding offense near 67 decentered ain't kokanee the center here and it's going to be interesting to watch dan Copa tonight he was out of the game last week with a knee injury some question as to whether or not he was going to be able to make this one at that time Daniel Muir just a little too quick for now in the final minute the quarter second out of 19 it's watching moving into the slot on the left baekpa Moretti he gets it to the 15yard line so it takes braiding almost a quarter but you know sooner or later he's gonna find wes welker who makes his teamleading 56th catch of the year and that was the first nap this entire game the Colts played defensively without their nickel Tom Brady saw it convicted apart 56 grams for Walker who's also missed a couple of games so that's in six games plus a boyhood quarter the game tied at 7 Indianapolis continues after these messages second quarter in Indianapolis Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth an Andrea Kramer the game is tied at 7 and it's third down and four for the Patriots at the Indianapolis 15 yard line Devon filled flanking Brady the gajillion missed a couple of games of the Vulcan cool and the pass goes to the outside and that is Isiah stand back just activated making the catch and picking up a first down well one of the problems that you have you try and come up and bring everybody around the line of scrimmage not a lot of support underneath that time we're seeing Tom Brady any time these pass rushers just they have to make a quick move to try and get there you can see how frustrated they've been so far because Tom Brady has just gotten stand back so amused to form the past couple of seasons that Dallas had two receptions last year his left side and tented for Randy Moss and got it away quickly second a goal they came with a safety blitz that time and it left oneonone up with the outside Randy Moss against drawed powers and they call this rookie an old man they said they have never seen anybody come in with the kind of understanding of the game of football that this kid has he just continues to impress and they think he's a future whole goal Moss got shaken up Moss comes off the field here back on the bench on second down and goal a tight formation and they give it to Moloney ellis block and he's tackled at the 4yard line it will be third down and goal watch needs a moment on the sidelines yeah for Randy Moss that's what Tom Brady said we said all right when you go out and you're playing against the Indianapolis Colts what's the first thing you look at when you break the huddle they said wash after the right walk line up in the swamp that way now this way Stanback is do they left third and goal ladies gonna go down put that much to this point and got a 30 day Malthus sets up Nick cassia outside then goes back inside and comes away with the sack huge play that's the kind of pressure they're gonna need tonight but they're gonna have a chance against this Patriots office red zone wolves continue for New England right t6 lead and he does then at 45 into the second quarter in the decade no seven bill belichick he knows Peyton Manning extremely well he knows a lot of great quarterbacks very well against Joe Montana there was his record against Dan Marino this is Bill as a head coach Cleveland in New England and is the primary defensive assistant either with the Giants in the 80s or the Jets at the end of the 90s in Manning seven and seven in the regular season two and one in post season so when you think about it Belichick and Manning have played this little chess game for the equivalent of more than a full season postseason the end zone by chance Simpson well you can watch him on the sidelines going over the Polaroids and they're looking at the same exact pictures but as far as brainpower Peyton Manning against Bill Belichick that's pretty good that's a pretty serious competition on the respective sidelines and Peyton was telling us last night that Bill Belichick stands at the 50 and watches us warm up I turn around and watch them warm up and of course they do completely the opposite of what they do in the game during pregame warmup there is lot of gamesmanship going on out here the essence of the game is deception Oscar now the bounds at the 25 yard line that is where he steps out at for a gain of let's make of the 26 gain of six one of the things that you'll see the Colts do is use these little pick plays in here they're pretty good at it they don't always make a lot of contact like they're all it does is create a little space where that slot receiver to come off and make the play that time body saw blitz right to the back second school the ground for a very short gain over the right side B third down and three as you can see bantha cain questionable with that rib injury sustained on a special teams play in a day list Thomas who's been in it I wouldn't say the doghouse but now tell what somebody mind them for a couple of weeks he's back in intended for pierre garcon and li pod with the coverage on the play and it'll be fourth down leave baden a guy that started 15 games for the Lions last year an old warhorse in this league is just gonna beat bear gars on to the ball and i think a lot of times these Patriots quarterbacks they read the drop of peyton manning so once you see a corner do something like that look for those double moves to come or by Welker that's why three odd juxtaposition when you look at how they both got into the national football league Manning of course was a Harold pace pool player as well as the college player Tennessee knew he'd go 1 or 2 in the draft and he went number one Brady played at Michigan you know the story sixth round so whereas Manning was the first guy picked in the draft Tom was the 100 mm wes welker a pickup twelve yards on a screen to the outside tackled by Gary Brackett one of the early stories in this game for me is Sebastian Ballmer the left tackle who's playing for Matt light here's a guy that grew up in Germany was a soccer player and swam and just didn't think it was quite physical enough for him so he joined a local American football team made the German national team and European allstar team travelled to the States for the global championships and impressed so many people there then they had about ten recruiters show up on his doorstep my first and 10 making the catch and going into the end zone Antoine Bethea is right there but Moss makes it look so easy as he gets under that ball hung forever and he's able to make the catch and go into the end zone absolutely love what they're doing here forget the corners go run your routes on the safeties you got Antoine but they going straight down basically having to true not happening so Randy Moss against the safety just an unfair competition Tom Brady took advantage look at that catch it's great Vicki again Sebastien Ballmer looked at the job he's doing on Dwight Freeney that route took some time the atom under control boss out of 71 sweet 63 tonight the extra point by Gustave ski is good Moss is cool and New England has a tenpoint lead early in the second quarter Tony Dungy is back in New York of course watching the game in our Studios at 30 rock and clearly Randy Moss has been the story of the game so far and in addition to Moss what else have you seen so far Tony well they've done a great job in New England moving him around to get him away from the doubleteam but also the Colts haven't gone to Dallas Park even though he's been covered by a linebacker a lot I think Payton may be out thinking himself figuring they're gonna take him away they'll start to go to him I'm Sur against that linebacker cover and we'll watch that as this Drive will commence after the run back and the kick is taking a yard bring up past the pointy 23 yard line Kyle Arrington made the hard hit once the baton does go to Clark here Clark has caught two balls tonight for 37 yards Wayne is caught a pair as well for 41 well one of the things that Payton's had trouble with here lately is the fact that no one's respecting his running game I watched him against Houston last week and he would go play fake on the stretch play that they used to run so well and the linebackers would back up and look like a run in the line happiness those are the head to the line of scrimmage he was out of the pockets that is no grounding second and ten but you cannot be onedimensional against great football teams now there is a flag you have to at least throw it with a receiver somewhere in the neighborhood offensive pass interference number 17 blocking downfield on a forward pass 10yard penalty first down so it has nothing to do with grounding but the penalty is on Kali well here's what happens on this one they expect the timing of the screen route to be such that he's going to get it out in about two or three seconds when it I tried to scramble out of there they threw off the timing they blocked early and that's why you got the foul so the dam remains first down his first and Brown gets to the 21 yard line Brandon McGowan making the tackle it's a gain of seven of the least second and 13 through week nine Indianapolis twenty ninth in the league in rushing yards per game now the average is 27 there's a die on the sidelines right now his average is weak cool his average is 0.6 the 28 yard line Gary Guyton makes the tough stop so from the first and 20 they go down to a third and six at the 28 yard line well Donna Braun missed a few weeks here with a shoulder injury but now is back in and he certainly he's a very intelligent young man good football player very college player in his here picked up this office pathetic flag down as well at the 29 the near side of the field and that was a free shot for Jerrod Mayo illegal shift offense two men moving penalty is declined fourth down and how did Mayo get that free well it ended up happening peyton manning saw what was coming a blitz look coming so he brought Dallas Clark down in tight but the play clock was running down and on that play Dallas Clark had to try and get on the line of scrimmage and get Reggie Wayne off they were both moving and they come up with the penalty so the late shift by the Patriots got paid that time this is already Maccabees fourth punt what's the last time you see hunter but for time minutes of a game wes welker with a one v9 at the 42yard line nine and a half to play of the hammer whittling up my avionics ef4 night outside booth gazed at Lucas Oil Stadium where's content now for the Patriots in the his family auction and the the inside fake out of the gun that's good for 36 yards and he's shredding the Indianapolis secondary while they shift coverages now and bullets going to come down and play a single high safety here and Tom Brady had the absolute perfect call I am what that four or five speed it is and right now the Colts just have no answers for Tom Brady and another problem Tim Jennings owner has just left there the 5yard gain here or Laurence Moroney or second down let's go back to Oh seven and you're gonna see a pretty familiar play here undefeated in Randy Moss same thing same Antoine Bethea instead of running routes on the corners they can and force that safety to turn like a quarterback they're not used to doing that they're not these balls in the air and the day got support second down and four when the 16 yard line here's Brady to the first at Christmas acre they can be dancin the other thing we have to bring up to Chris is that Bob Sanders who was the Defensive Player of the Year a couple of years ago he is gone for the season Kelvin Hayden is not playing and neither is Marlon Jackson they are already before the game even starts three guys who were huge and when we were at practice on Friday Aaron Francisco who they plan to play as the dime back got hurt and practiced and he can't play in this one so they start with they're all over the place right now Brady having a field day Sean for 223 yards their time on Washington a little miscommunication is Giraud powers with the coverage and looking back was mosses at the center no you told me a fade slant and go here what's this he's going to come in fake the slant watch the reaction by powers this kids really something I mean he is really a good player how many rookie corners have ever had Randy Moss assigned to him in a oneonone situation and so far he's held his own now the safeties have been getting burned but he's done okay second and goal boss what's the delight five plays 57 yards and that's 23 going on 24 unanswered points for New England gentlemen a rookie at a Kent State rooters a quarterback has just scored his first NFL touchdown instead of the beginning this was they hit the buzz of a heavyweight championship fight if this were a heavyweight championship fight I think they would be sending New England to a neutral corner right now if India break no question about it Robert Mathis had a chance over here he had Tom Brady beats Nick kashering gets him in his hands but Brady too strong escapes buys a little time and finally finds Edelman there's really the key to the play you know Tom Brady's not a fast guy he's not a scrambler but he is a guy that within the pocket has a great feel for when somebody's coming after him just avoids buys time and you can imagine trying to cover somebody for six seconds at this part of the field Dwight Freeney on the other side tries to come with the inside move but they have neutralized him all game long and in fairness let's say this sebastian Vollmer for the most part has not had a lot of help has been a tremendous key to this explosion of points for the Patriots gentleman with a broken floor on he has that cast on the right arm and had 24 points against a defense simpson downs it in the end zone they started to 20 Sunday night football brought to you by Disney's old dogs in theaters everywhere November this money fit by Toyota moving forward by Subway restaurants introducing subway melts like chicken cordon bleu subway eat fresh and by Coors Light about to turn blue your beer is as cold as the don't look at me when I Oh measured Bengals first out of the 20yard line Simpson feedback with the die on the bench around on the Simpson up to the 26 yard line watch Vince Wilfork right inside here we had a chance to meet him last night he's one of the largest human beings I've ever seen he comes in and he's a great guy who's so personal because and also the receiver Robinson hit as he throws and Mayo says well I tell you this game is almost being played in Reverse for me I thought that that you would see a ton of pressure by the Colts in this game and yet it is the Patriots pressure on the outside Derrick Burgess is working on Ryan diamond Dean just barely gets a finger on him when this print pass protection has to get better for Peyton Manning his name they have to rely on pity across the 30 for a first down before he's tackled by Darius buck going back to the basics at their playbook now they just get Reggie Wayne in the squad with that little inandout move he is one of the quicker receivers around and cause well like panic juicing the 24 jonathan Wilhite the last play they brought Reggie Wayne in and then out this time they're gonna go out and then in the Patriots as they have done the majority of the times in the past want to try and pressure these white outs and get their face and this is section again if you mr. ad I scored a touchdown earlier in the game but had to go to the locker room and they taped two fingers together so he has not been in since we'll take a look at how they've taped him up there and so it would be in particular difficult to get involved in the passing game again the last Pierre Garcon interfered with by Lee body interference defense first down well there you had Pierre Garcon the guy that peyton manning's thought was gonna have to make some plays these receivers and the body going to grab the jersey there at the end they're gonna call inside the 30 that chad simpson who mainly runs back dicks would come into the game on a very key drive with the team down by 17 and do the job but Derek Burgess is going to blow this when he's gonna loop back inside trying to get a pass rush the ends up losing contain where Jeff saturd he what a nice move by him to get on the outside and get the contained sealed as well great speed on that one by Saturday I saw on the back of the endzone covered well second down and gar saw needs some help they're gonna run out of ambulances around here it really was completely thrown off timing Garcon I think almost thought the play was over and then Paton just threw it late if machines Sanders that comes in at the end remember no force out anymore so this is clearly out of bounds and gar sauce still still down hopefully just there the wind getting knocked out of them by the legs or Sanders as he went to the turf you can see Sanders legs sort of getting him in the midsection and let's hope all it did was knock the wind out of him that'll send Hank Baskett into the game the former eagle and it's not totally shocking and practice on Friday he was taking a lot of reps and so he sort of slowly in the last couple of weeks been playing a little bit more of the former Philadelphia Eagle who just sort of jogged on the field so yeah Reggie Wayne he beats the second year back will and on a drive at Indianapolis needed to cash in on the get seven we're gonna see the safety trying jump underneath of the field Peyton until he was completely out of position great job by Reggie Wayne getting those feet officially 7dx Stover boots it through so after New England escort 2414 rapping Garr saws left foot on the sideline after he was hurt and then Wayne makes the catch in the back of the endzone to make it a ten point game again and with force 17 to the half New England will get the ball Reggie Wayne benefit at that time from all the attention that Dallas Clark's was getting Sony Dungey talking about how much attention that these Patriots pay to Dallas Clark red 14 catches they had a plan for thanks for Reggie Wayne Wayne's caught five tonight for 77 yards I'm afraid me Slater be cold don't come out by Wheeling would have a comparison take a look at the figures right here and your perfect rating and good numbers for Manning but his team was in serious trouble before the one scoring defense in the NFL is the Indianapolis Colts and so far they've been from recording it showed pressure and checked out of it and a gun philosophy second and ten and again we were talking about coming into the game the two teams that had given up the fewest points per game in the league thirteen points five for the courts 24 tonight on pace to give up about 50 after a he's the new defensive coordinator and Jim cow intended for Wes Welker where you saw the bolts and paint man wes welker establishing something underneath so important because if they can just pay him deep in because of work looking for three it out and they get there for you we've seen Tom Brady on the cover of nearly every magazine in the country sports and otherwise he might be added to the list for the ballet magazine her next like that before answered the punt the guys in front of the one of the great things about this rivalry the games have been so highly anticipated and most of them have have really lived up to the building I read something the other day somebody actually wrote that the network's made a deal with the league to make sure these two teams faced each other and even though they're not on the same division that's not how it works there's a formula and it just so happened to work out that almost every year they do face each other well it's a good idea and if there is that formula savagely you should do that now that's amazing these two teams used to be in the same division and the games meant nothing when they did play twice a year and now that they switched divisions all of a sudden this is the greatest rivalry of all looked like our saw who had been hurt and had his foot wrap twisting around hand it's just for a second bottom of the coverage but it's incomplete second down well Carson's going to have to win these battles he is oneonone where's the ankle bothering him in a little bit so we'll give him some benefit of the doubt but it is the coverage on Dallas Park right now that's a ladies wait Jun 12 2014 2 slot right over here kinds of traffic around Dallas Clark win this back and injurytime up that is Rob Nicholas who is down on the ground Banta Kane was injured earlier so there's the man who was filling the spot occupied by the starter Banta Kane so they are really down to Derrick Burgess and a Dale is Thomas on the outside 3:24 to play in the first half and as you look down upon the state capital of Indiana tonight's aerial coverage brought to you the blindside I'm not so sure this crowd doesn't think that that injury had something to do with wanting the Patriots to make a few substitution that out there there's a pretty sophisticated crowd they've seen that happen before I'm thinking the same thing when a guy is down and then won't sudden he gets up and he looks like he can run a marathon false start offense number 85 that's Garcon who was lined up wide to the right he did he definitely flinched and you know sometimes this stadium gets so quiet wide receivers aren't used to hearing the snap count you know there's always a bunch of noise and things then when it's this quiet you start hearing jokes and Eric Burgess forced the issue getting into the backfield and hittin Manning for content and on the coverage a kid I really like this Patrick Chung number 25 last week in last couple weeks he's proven what a great Blitzer he is now out there in coverage on Dallas Clark they have some really good young safeties for the New England Patriots they can hit they can cover and they could run so Mac defeat upon fifth in the punt they also punted five times from the first day against the 49 there's a couple years ago shower he would barely see here's welcome kind of bounds at about the 36 yard line speaking of magazine covers for Brady it runs the gamut hu si plenty of time supporters they undercover lindy colas dichotomy here and then they both may get some time to time you know I think I can say in the English language and they can find something to throw up from the TriCaster right these guys are remarkable disease on holes the neither guys been on Popular Mechanics to our model the 36 yard line described against me for games the twominute warning two and a half to play of the half how much does Tom Brady like Kevin Park really singing his praises about how he's one of the most intelligent players that he has ever played with loves in the backfield understands the passing game understands protections and just loves him as a guy in as it told us last night right at the top of the list of smart players dependable always in the right place 11th year for second round pick back in all the way down to the twominute warning and Indianapolis Tripoli a filming on this Sunday night second down and eight for because Robert Mathis got right in his grill third down and eight what a brilliant play by Robert Mathis even on the bit of a double team coming on the outside watch this move splits the to an honest it's a sack the courts have been able to pay you get the point there's Brady Edelman with a cast on the right forearm when he scored that touchdown before his first NFL touchdown he was a right hand to quarterback at Kent State he had a spike at left handed let's stand back here gonna come down and get a chip against white brainy Franny said I know I'm going to end up getting hit from all different directions but for a wide receiver that's a pretty good one right there mmhmm so now with 147 Chris Hansen with his third punt of the night EJ rushing in a game in which there were 38 points before the hash but thrive short kick we skip leveled out the Paton coming back out he is two timeouts 33yard boot look at that Simpson now who had come in and did a good job with a head injury and he is questioning the return so we die with his fingers Browns coming back off the shoulder and now you got a problem with Simpson well that just means throw a couple more wide receivers on the field let Peyton Manning go to work this is him against Tennessee right before the half he drive the drive he put together and this is a guy with a couple of timeouts in a minute 36 seconds when he talked to deal with a safe brought by Reggie Wayne six spotted at the 30yard line they're leaving Dallas Clark down inside here too is up at the 36 yard line tackle by will hike Reggie Wayne right out here or Dallas Clark I'm sorry on the end of the line of scrimmage we're fast walk by Kali giving them what Indies taking underneath yes from territory at the 48yard line he in a penalty illegal motion offense back was not set that back was brown illegal motion with 41 seconds we saw Donald Brown in practice the other day of course he's been out a few weeks with the shoulder injury and he looked a little uncomfortable he and Payton ran into each other one time on a handoff and you just sit out a couple of weeks in this offense and all of a sudden there's a lot of foreign things they changed everything every week and Brown just got caught just a rookie second down and seven at that point he's gonna have to start looking deeper downfield there's no anyone knows that as well starting to see the defensive lineman for the Patriots in this nohuddle offense worn down here they don't have much depth left over there because of all the entries this will be the 36 play run by the Colts in this half he'd been feeling good inside position the pass was a strike and he dropped it third down nice move by Austin Collie to get open he's going to go out fake the out come back inside but now you know sometimes they talk about workers in your for Kali and that passes infancy and now Indianapolis is in a situation where they're forced to punt well the one thing I thought Kali had trouble with last week against Houston was the bump and run coverage and so far we have seen the Patriots up in his face the entire game forcing him to make moves against that bump and run coverage and it hasn't worked and timeout is taken by New England this will be the sixth punt for mcafee and it's the most punch in a first half by the cold since 1992 through the decades talk about the Colts at 1:09 and there they were Lombardi's Packers with 96 in the 60s the Cowboys under Landry with 105 in the 70s and then Bill Walsh started a weave his magic and San Francisco at 104 that continued into the 90s with George Seifert and Steve Mariucci at 113 to the 49ers had that spectacular 20year run and other Colts at a buck o9 in this decade more than 7 what the punt go but we'll be down at the mine with 22 seconds and Grady will probably just take a knee and the teams will head to the locker room yeah the Colts do have a couple of timeouts here so can't really afford an incomplete pass at this point or you might have to give it back to the upthat's well they've got two timeouts right you can only stop it twice so it's looking up at the clock knowing what the strategy is here me whomp New England will get the ball to start the second half remember they won the opening toss and elected to defer the math right here you can still do a couple of the clock run out sent some indie even calling the timeout right here the teams will head to the locker room and for a 38point first half halftime in Indianapolis New England 24 the Indianapolis Colts 14 coming right up but first these messages Space Station
