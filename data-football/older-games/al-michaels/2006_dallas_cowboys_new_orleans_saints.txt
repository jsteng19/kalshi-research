============================================================

how bout them Cowboys is the rallying cry once again in North Texas and y9 the Dallas Cowboys have won four straight five of their last six they calendar the field at Texas Stadium and Irving ready to take on Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints on NBC's Sunday Night Football Al Michaels along with John Madden Andrew Kramer welcome to Texas Stadium the Saints come in as the best story in the National Football League in 2006 Hurricane Katrina made them vagabonds last year they were three and thirteen now they're back home in New Orleans they are eight and four under rookie head coach Sean Payton who's done a tremendous job drew Brees came over from San Diego he has been terrific and of course Reggie Bush the Heisman Trophy winner last year beginning to make a name for himself four touchdowns last week for the Cowboys a remarkable turnaround in the middle of the season they had a Monday night meltdown against the Giants Bill Parcells changed quarterbacks went to Tony Romo and this town right now John is gaga over Tony Romo who's won four straight leads the league in passer rating Bill Parcells of course wants to throw a little cold water on it but what's your feeling about what he's done for this team and his performance oh yeah I think he's done everything for this team I mean you watched Tony Romo and he's very comfortable in the pocket I mean he can drop back as a quick release can get rid of the ball he can also escape he can get to the outside I think he throws the ball on the run as well as anyone and as I look at this cowboy team now he's really improved all the areas he's made the wide receivers better he's made the offensive line better and he's made the running backs better his team is eight and four as are the Saints so John so what do you attribute this remarkable turnaround and what's the formula to be to read my team on the road tonight I think it's a Norland Saint offense I think they have to have a big night and if you say you know what's the biggest thing for the same team to me it's getting drew brees because he's not only a quality guy but he's a quality quarterback leading the league in passing it and he's something special and he's gonna have to have a big night tonight so we've got Romo we've got Brees and a couple of other guys you may know a little bit about Reggie Bush Terrell Owens star power in the Lone Star State tonight on Sunday Night Football the herbing Texas the Dallas Cowboys come in very healthy for the 13th game of the season it's a different story though for the Saints more on that let's go to the field and check in with Andrea Kramer hello Angie don't play despite a who told me to practice with that all week fancy doesn't feel structure we'll keep an eye on them and of course closely is a tremendous story of seven runs Rams racing right now the top playoff seats the Bears play the Rams tomorrow night they're tending to the winner of this game will move for the moment into the number2 spot who use the Seahawks were beaten by Arizona this afternoon so Seattle is now eaten five leading the NFC West Martine gramatica who'd been on the street and then was signed when they released Mike van der Jan and won the game last week at the Meadowlands to kick off Fred McAfee back to receive black balls popping in away we go from Irving Texas you've got Michael newest to run the kick back and Luis now out to the 29 yard line and a penalty so a flag on the run back Jerry Austin is the referee tonight all right Jerry the stage is yours on a return drew brees two really great years with San Diego but they had to make a decision there and then he hurt himself at the end of last year and had shoulder surgery they decided to go with Phillip Rivers so Brees took a look around looked at Miami looked at Marlins and it turned out that New Orleans was the spot forum and right now he is having a tremendous year in his Johnson is probably the primary reason for their record they spread a lot as they empty the backfield and on first down Marcus Colston that seventh round draft choice makes the catch and let's take a look at the New Orleans offense drew Brees Boilermaker goose macau's the University of Mississippi Reggie Bush USC marques colston Hofstra University the town's cop East Carolina University mark Campbell Michigan tomorrow universe Oklahoma Jamar Nesbitt South Carolina Jeff Shane Notre Dame Jerry Evans Bloomsburg University John Stinchcomb Georgia you've got portion Macalester both in the lineup at the moment and when they do that they normally split Bush as they do here and then that pass is dropped by the tight end that's more feeble unable to handle it let's take a look at the Dallas D markets beers Louisiana State Jason Ferguson George Chris can t Virginia al singleton temple Brady James LSU taking it down Perdue DeMarcus Ware troll fans Newman Kansas State Roy Williams Oklahoma Keith Davis Sammy's the state that Anthony Hitler without for second down and 10 now with the Saints a kinky receivers to the left when Colston goes in launching into the Swat Reeves under pressure so that Dallas defense and they can put a lot of pressure on with that nickel DeMarcus Ware is there and he figures to play a big role in tonight's game we under Marcus where is a big pass rusher for this cowboy team and when you when you get him up here in the line and you give him a start like this and you just watch him you are not going to be able to block him with a bat and you better turnout DeMarcus Ware because he's going to run right by anyway he'll play left side like he did on that time when you've also play on the right side like he is right now on the third down play breeze out of the shotgun third and 17 stepping up throws underneath the Reggie Bush and Reggie those patented lose because Terrence Newman is right there to say Matt now you know in a corner back making a tackle like Terrence Newman just made in the open field against Reggie Bush can get excited about that as he can about not going to ball down because you always say Reggie Bush you have to get him an open space and he's very tough if he gets an open space Terrence Newman has to do what he did Steve Weatherford a rookie from Illinois with a booming punt that is fair caught at the 21 yard line by Newman e 53yard punt so Tony Romo and the Dallas offense coming out onto the field tonight football being brought to you by Southwest Airlines proud sponsor of the NFL official airline of Super Bowl 41 by Verizon Wireless by the new 2007 lincoln navigator and by aragon friday only in theaters downtown Dallas Cowboys we'll start with four receivers as they huddle up here you've got Owens and Terry Glenn as their starters and then same herd and Patrick Crayton are the others so they are Julius Jones in the back they were for watch here and Tony Romo on his first snack of the night with a quick toss to grano s to turn behind him to make the catch and pull it in and take it up to the 23 yard line he's tackled by the former cowboy Scot Shanley Tony Romo even though it's his first year as a starter has been with the team now for this is his fourth season three years backing up people like Quincy Carter Vinny Testaverde Drew Bledsoe and of course he took over for blood so in the second half of that Monday night game against the Giants starting on next week against Carolina and led them to a comefrombehind victory the trail 40 the muffin that one apology leader stands on second and eight that's notify James and cleanest James in the Saints territory being chased from behind nobody will get him touchdown Dallas 77 yards for Julius Jones the longest run of history you know everyone has to block to get a play like that it starts with flows all atoms you're going to see Terrell Owens you're going to see Oliver white right there in the fullback he gets that lead block there Jones gets to the outside Terrell Owens makes a block on the corner and then Julius Jones his guy there matica for the point after so a two yard pass to Glenn a 77 yard run by Jones and just like that it's seven to nothing Cowboys Julius Jones came into the game averaging three point nine yards per rush and he was seeing less and less action as Marion Barber was seeing more and more especially on short yardage and third down and in other situations and then Julia says I've got a little bit left myself friends and built for ourselves loves having two backs that they'll eat figured plenty equally Micheal Lewis we started the year on the unable to perform less and he loses the football a scrum and nothing yet from the officials the line judge at the body language of a guy ready to point in Dallas is direct to but jerry austin comes in and says no Saints recover and then comes reason we'll go back and take a look at Terrell Owens and what he did on the touchdown run by Julius Jones well you know in an era where you know wide receivers that really don't hustle I mean that's a pretty average block but you know look at Terrell Owens just run on this thing he's not he's going to get a position right at the end to make the block he doesn't have to but he's just kind of refreshing to see a guy play all out Josh Bullock's a little shoved there at the end as if to say hey listen pal try to keep up with me that's nice McAllister taken down by Al singleton after a gain of four to the 25yard line the Saints number one in total offense and that means they've gained more yards per game than any team in the league and in passing yardage they lead in neck department as well Sean Payton does the play call you know and girl Brees wheels around it's not only his wide receivers but Reggie Bush has 73 reception on his way to close to a hundred he's on that sort of the pace right now and this is McAllister up to the 26 reduce McAllister he's coming off knee surgery he'd been their primary back over the past three or four seasons then he tears up his knee has ACL surgery then he's recuperating and then of all things Houston passes on Reggie Bush and New Orleans gets Bush and so it's almost like insult to injury but Sean Payton said hold on a second there's plenty of room for you he's still going to get 20 carries again and goose is really a team guy and all he wanted to be part of the team and where he stands and we just watched the way they play and he takes the heavy load of the running game third down and five please protect first down as the connections made by McAllister and deuces up to the 34 yard line Brees loves to spreaded around Bush with 73 grams closed in 54 Joe horn is hurt you'll see Deborah Henderson tonight and that's McCallister's 25th catch of the year we intrude Drew Brees moves around also you know he changes his launch point he's he's a shorter quarterback and you know that's probably why he went the high school in Texas and didn't go to a Texas College because he says he's six foot he's probably a little under six button there's not a lot of people one six for quarterbacks but this guy's festival five receivers that go to Reggie Bush and Bush does not go out of bounds comes back in and takes it up to the 40yard line breaking away from a Keith Davis would be tackle that's a gain of seven it'll be second down and three and a new Saints record four running backs and as we say he's on a pace that would net him about a hundred and the Saints right now going without a huddle on second down and three and again that five receiver said yeah they have the empty backfield and Drew Brees is excellent in the shotgun and frozen that world not caught it is incomplete there's no fumble as Henry will take it toward the end zone but Marcus Colston never had control of it third down you know we're talking about DeMarcus Ware and when a big pass rusher he is watch him here he starts out in the slot then he gets a good run and Jamal Brown is the left tackle and then he had DeMarcus Ware met right there that was a heck of a flexible collision I think Jamal Brown is the best offensive lineman of this group second year out of Oklahoma he was in number one draft choice last year Natalie showed blitz and they do and then Greece gets it away in the past for Coulson is incomplete that's Erin Glenn who comes in in the nickel covering on the play fourth down Bell fun you know and we're talking about Drew Brees being 6foot him because he is six foot he's going to get pressure when you give him pressure it's like here you bring both safeties right up in the middle the big thing on a shorter quarterback is always to rush right up the middle get in his face make them have vision problems Steve Weatherford his first pot was 53 this considerably shorter Patrick Crayton takes it from the 23 back to the 26 yard line and for a 36 yard booth about six minutes into the game seven to nothing Dallas Danny and Tomlinson of course playing on some other planet right now has already broken the record for touchdowns three today 29 for the season we'll see him a week from tonight now the Cowboys on their second possession for the 26 yard line first and there's two tight ends and two wives here Rowe Moyle play fake stepping up has a great feel in the pocket and the pass is caught by Jason Witten the tight end up at the 44 yard line Witten on the other end of that big play last week in New York in the final minute his self chromatic his gamewinning field goal NoFD Cowboys do owls they put three tackles in for protection here's their third tackle Jason Fubini and that's what makes the pocket you see they have they have that extra lineman in there and they just form a pocket right around Tony Romo and it's definitely usually when you put like a tackle in a tight end it's usually a running situation when the Cowboys do it was to beanie every time they've done it this year they've thrown the ball and that's how this success that takes him out to the 44 yard line now Jones again and this time he does not good in fact Mark Simoneau the first the hit him let's take a look at the Dallas offense Tony Romo Eastern Illinois Julius Jones Notre Dame all of a whore NC State Terrell Owens Tennessee Chattanooga Terry Glenn the Ohio State University Jason Witten Tennessee Flozell Adams Michigan State Kyle Kosar Arizona State and remarque Colorado Marco Rivera Penn State Park Columbo of Boston College mark Columbo doing a great job this year heard a few years ago the Bears number ones actually said his career might be over so far so singling him out to us this week as a guy having a terrific year you go the other way second down this time as Jones takes it up to the 48 yard line let's take a look at the New Orleans defense Charles Grant Julie Brian Young Utah Friday Leslie UCLA Will Smith the Ohio State Scott Fujita Cal mark Simon Arkansas State Scott Shanley Nebraska Mike McKenzie mommy no other senior hi ho marched out Meyer Fresno State Josh pullups and the bras Fred Thomas whose high school bruised Mississippi will they go to work on Rodney Leslie he is the guy taking Hollis Thomas's place Thomas who would be is been suspended for the rest of the regular season for violating the league's steroid policy so Leslie number 77 as the nice order there it's third down and six brawl moment of the shotgun stepping up to the outside that in slip Terry Glenn the intended receiver but it's sailed on and it's worth down here sometimes wonder if that really sailed on him or if he just didn't have anything in he's learning a lesson you know if you don't have anything throw it away don't force the ball and I think that's one of the lessons that Tony won't give that Tony Romo has learned you think Bill Parcells has parked on that a little bit yeah hey so um sometimes sometimes for always a good plug throwaway of cutting isn't bad Matt McBride float this one into the arms of Michael Lewis at the 12 yard line Saints will take it there six and a half to go in the opening period the Dallas Cowboys on top of a New Orleans Saints 7 nothing star video coverage tonight brought to you by Sirius satellite radio Irving Texas Texas Stadium home of the Cowboys in 71 Reggie Bush is the running back in this set Mike Carney is the fullback Brees will throw and a hit Carney and Carney out to the 21 gain of nine for Drew Brees this is a familiar stadium he hasn't played here in ten years but the last time he play here he was in high school he went to Austin Westlake I came in here in the state championship game had a tremendous night and his team won the Texas 5a title from Austin drew brees grew up there wound up going to Purdue in the big ten in the San Diego here and this is Kearney the fullback again so you you have Bush and you have McAllister and then you have the fullback and they passed to him and he runs for a first down and I think I think maybe that was his first run of the year because they usually block him and you know again when you're talking about Deuce McAllister and you're talking about Reggie Bush Mike Carney is not going to get a lot of touches but they do throw it to him and he's a good bleep block or a very good lead blocker at the 29 yard line on first down and Reggie wishes are back now and they'll swing it out to Bush and Bush survey he just hesitated and then he has those moves if you watch the play at SC you know he can do that he looks ahead he sees where the block is gonna go cuts to the inside turns it into a first down and I was saying the other days is you know I'm sure as a kid you know he was never it and tag I mean he has those moves that are just natural moves and you know he just sets up weights and then you know just you know plants this way and that goes that way and you know you hate to say someone's like Barry Sanders and I don't mean that at all that he's you know in his work here like Barry Sanders but he has some Barry Sanders type moves and he's explosive he catches the ball again and of course we're not going to anoint him you don't anoint our wookie as the next very standard but that's a point well taken John among the things he does that Barry did too he lose his yardage a lot of the time because he's looking for that big run and so the downside to that is you're gonna lose yardage on a good percentage of your running plays right especially to the outside and backs it that you know dance and make all those quick moves aren't going to lose yardage but they're also going to get some big big game second and ten freeze to the outside corny who has a one and two catches tonight and takes it across the 50 to the Dallas 48 yard line and a first down for the Saints yeah that's not a big thing to do I mean a bad thing to do when you get here and you have your two receivers here so you just run everything off and then you get Mike Carney out there with no defender and just let him or run right up the field now a guy that is this good lead blocker is going to run over someone in the open field Reggie Bush's in the tailback now 48 yard line Barney was in the slot and Philip by Chris Cathy number 99 well Chris candy you know it's funny Bill Parcells he says I not only have a doghouse I have a hotel and he's right I mean he has an entire kennel and in the kennel this week would be Cathy and his opposite number on the other side Marcus Spears yeah because he figures that you know he's not getting good enough play from his two defensive ends in the threeman line and Cathy's a tall guy I mean he's six foot six six foot seven and he plays too high and he's not getting a pass what an aggressive pass west on first and second down he says Spears on the sidelines and that's a dangerous pass and it's incomplete Terrence Newman is right there smothering Reggie Bush it'll be third down and nine you know sometimes you just shouldn't throw that ball I mean if you look look at the receivers and you look at the coverage right here to do something like this the coverage has to be off what the coverage back off if you're going to throw that screen you can't have both those defenders on the line surprised that he didn't make it audible for third and nine he sends bus into the slot you got McAllister offset in the backfield he looks to the outside and hits Colston and Colston will be taken down just short of a first down by Anthony Henry so Colston makes the catch but the ball spotted at the 39 it will be fourth down and one you know a good tackle there by Anthony Henry I mean that's what you have to do if they're gonna throw that slant on third down you have to stop him short of the first down and make them make these types of decision I think Sean Payton will learn this from Bill Parcells who over the years seems the loves to go for it on fourth down and they will on fourth and one and it's McAllister handing it to Devery Henderson and that will be a first down so Henderson touches the ball for the first time tonight he is explosive thirdyear wide out out of LSU and on fourth and one they run it back to this side and pick up the first you know you look at Sean pate and then looking at that card you wonder how did this card even get on a play for short yardage DeMarcus Ware was there in the backfield he was lucky to get by him watch 94 here you know he has that reverse he sees it coming and he could only get one hand on it but that is a heck of a call for than one I don't know that I ever would have made it said that earlier this year Javon Walker pulled that off in a Denver game and here DeMarcus Ware well he may have missed Devery Henderson but he then comes flying into the backfield for the second the next play but there's a flag that was offside against the Cowboys and it's gonna be on the guy made the sack the mark is where I was going to say that he either got a heck of a jump on that ball or he was offsides and it turned out to be the latter here he is you see him right here yeah he got jumped before the ball was man but say he is that quick that he could not have went before the ball stuff is gonna jump like that type of player that you have to account for of your own offense he always have to know 494 ease and then in the half to go in period and a Reggie Bush for the 20 yard line yeah I think Reggie Bush brought something into this league a running back leaving his feet you know that's something that most running backs in the NFL don't do and Reggie Bush said he started this in his junior year at USC where right here at the end I mean you taking the deficit thing and you just jump over guys now now he said the first time that he ever did that he was on the 8 yard line and goes into the end zone I think I know how do you know that you can get eight yards on a leaf it's 24 feet be a great long jump Brees over the middle some more cable dead tighten and he'll take it inside the 10 so cable taking over when the Saints lost their starting tight end Ernie Conwell and he'll play a much bigger role as we go down the stretch I don't know that he will be he's limping off the field he got hurt on that play it was an interesting play what they did Alizee is they faked a screen to the right they got the cowboy defense to go out to that side and then they brought Campbell in the or the cowboy defense vacated now they give it to Bush no room on the right side he takes it to the five but this drive started at the New Orleans 12 it has reached the Dallas five we have reached the end of the first quarter on a 77 yard run by Julius Jones the Cowboys lead seven to nothing back after these messages on The Today Show on NBC suck a second order now Michaels John Madden names Rhea Kramer long drive that has consumed six and a half minutes has encompassed 83 yards and it's second down and goal as we start the second quarter Drew Brees the Saints quarterback off the play fake going into the end zone and that's knocked away by Anthony Henry intended for Terrence copper copper a former Dallas Cowboy Drew Brees does a great job of playaction pass room because we after doing playaction passes you have to have a good fake of the run but you can't stay with it too long you have to no bounce back up and get ready and he does he does that very very well Anthony Henry has 16 to it's an unofficial statistic for the Elias Sports Bureau does a great job of keeping information like that he leads to me that was his 16th right there third down and goal from the 5yard line the Cowboys just substituted six defensive players and that is what the discussion is more than likely about Gerry Austin the referee and now another change of five now five were coming in and five were going out the jury Austin and we lost his audio there at the end a move not common to football I believe is what he said is to me a heck of a lot of things well you know what it used to mean they used to call it jam and the signals that it was a big George Allen Washington Redskin thing where where the defensive guy makes a move or a sound that tries to claw the soft side and right now the sound is enough for drew brees to say time out we talked this over with third down and goal and here is what we're did yep a flinch a couple of points and a mentally third down and goal here John from the 2 yard line I think with Sean Payton is thinking if you're going to go for it on fourth down you would run the ball here now you'd run it and say if I don't make it are running up fourth down if you're going to kick a field goal on fourth down if you don't make it then this should be a passing down and now you've got only Carney in the back field we've got push in the slot to the left and it is Carney for the touchdown that is the element of support they say Carney never carries the ball they give you a pass formation they not only do that they offset partner you know he wasn't the fullbacks behind the quarterback they offset him here which says now this is the passing formation you got wide receiver wide receiver wide receiver spread them out you put your block or here this guy's a blocker no he's not a blocker you just handed it to him a boom you hit that quick crack right up the middle so that's Carney with a k and that Carney with a C John Carney to tried to tie the game Mike Carney touched the ball four times on that drive John Carney ties the game they go 88 yards in six minutes and 44 seconds and the Saints had seven first bounce along the way what a drive seven seven and the New Orleans Saints locked up at 7:00 early in the second quarter with the Saints to kick off Billy Cundiff a former cowboy brought in recently to kick off Kearney is still the field goal kicker and so kundan seems a bouncing liner down a Miles Austin and Austin able to break a couple of tackles inside the 20 takes it out to the 27 yard line Romo will go back to work he's two of his first three for 20 yards they love Tony Romo of course Bill Parcells you know the thing about Parcells it's not just Romo every time bill gets a star who becomes a sudden star if Larry David ever retires Bill Parcells should be the guy who replaces him on Curb Your Enthusiasm this is one guy who can curb their enthusiasm it's bill yeah yeah I mean he just doesn't want anyone to get carried away with themselves and whereas he says you know we don't want guys to be cute cool for school and he worries a little about that role but I don't know that the show drama throwing deep for Owens and it's incomplete intended for Terrell covered by Thomas speaking of ourselves rolling a little tape here for you I'd say that you guys are looking at him like a rookie and I'm not I'm impressed into the fact that he didn't turn the ball over and and he's managing the game well and that's what he's supposed to do and he I think he's a he's a football guy and he's he's interested in and playing well but we've got a ways to go here so put the anointing oil away second down and ten it's always the anointing oil and don't put them in camp yeah yeah and that's a passion is intercepted by omar Stoudemire another former cowboy and Romo turns the ball over so I guess we will put the anointing oil away at least on this Drive stop Meyer with the pic reads it perfectly and the New Orleans Saints get the turnover yes start Meyer is back there and he's just readin everything he's going to try and get Terry Glenn Terry Glenn right here 83 he's going to try and get him to the corner and you see stockmeyer there is back deep enough that he has everything in front of him he has blend in front of him he has Romo in front of him he has the ball in front of him and that lets him make a perfect jump from our spot where one time played for the Cowboys st. said three picks against the 49ers last week stop Meyer picks off his second of the year here now Brees retreats has about 12 seconds to throw and then the coverage is so good that he has to settle for McAllister underneath and The Deuce is able to pick up about three I'll tell you defensive coaches and head coaches really get upset when that happens when you give a quarterback that much time where Drew Brees could just sit back there and look right look left hook up in the middle look everywhere you think someone has to break loose sometime and none of those pass rushers broke loose well I said that's part of the threeman line but they also have a blitz come in there so they it wasn't just a free man Russ there's a start of a threeman line but they brought four now off the play fake Brees throws over the middle and that pass is incomplete trying to get it to Billy Miller who's the backup tight end mark Campbell caught that pass earlier to give him a first and goal but limped off and Miller is in there right now look at Sean Payton man he has he has his list of plays and again everything is broken down you know it's first intense second law in short third third long goal line short yardage red zone all those things so all those color codes and all those plays have a number on him and he just calls that number industry agrees that part is so huge he's taking fighting that call to a new level here at third down and seven and that's a pass that is caught on the outside by Colston and Marcus Colston takes it to the 24 what a story this guy is he's the fourth from last guy picked in the draft he's almost the guy they call mr. irrelevant that goes to the guy who's picked dead last played at Hofstra reminds you of Wayne Chrebet in that regard not in terms of his size and seeding all of that but what a shock he has been this year a great shot for New Orleans you know I was just watching him in the pregame warmup and you know he's six foot four 231 pounds but he really catches the ball with these this guy has great and soft hands miss last week's being displaying banking didn't practice much but when they're denied and then the past is gone John Owens the other tight end short game war on Colston let's go Andrea well like you said there's almost mr. irrelevant he had thirty three receivers selected before him he told me he never would have thought you'd have this kind of season he said he was confident in his ability but he never expected this this is great guys he said it's just crazy for me as it is for you guys and he said his welcome to the NFL moment was in Green Bay and routinely lined up against Charles Woodson he said that's when it hit him he was in the NFL 57 Cassie's form second down and six and they give it to Macalester they'd like to run that play a lot with a run normally Reggie Bush in motion and it looks like they can either give it to him on an endaround or give it to do sup the middle looks to do here setting up a third and one yeah that's exactly what they do and then they can check it now if you want to really collapse the line and come in on Deuce McAllister then they can hand it to Reggie Bush on the outside so they're always checking the containment you know if you don't have containment out there then shortly here after the ball is going to be handed to Reggie not now because be on the sidelines but that's that's the thing that they look for when they run that play they look to check the containment on the backside third one double tight end with a fullback Kearney in there they give it to megalis be reduced to the outside and McAllister coming back from knee surgery takes it to the 11 yard line and that's that's a lot of you hear this chorus induce a lot of people came in from the New Orleans area you know don't we see that more and more where there's more opponents fans and the stands I think that's that thing where people are selling tickets or something but I noticed just this crowd even blows here there's a lot of Saint fans here tonight and then of course any time he'll do some McAllister who carries the ball that's when you hear that big goo first intention the 11 that pass is caught and taking it to the 2 yard line that's Terrence copper the former Dallas Cowboy you've got a few of them and of course Sean Payton as the head coach Gary Gibbs as the defensive coordinator were both on parcels of staff last year right and I think Sean Payton learned that from Bill Parcells remember when he came here he brought those Patriot guys in the jet guys and you know guys that were kinda they called him his guys but guys that he knew and Sean who leaves Dallas knowing the heat goes down in New Orleans Saints and he brings his guys that he knows from the cowboy second and one from the to the fake to McAllister in the past caught by Kearney Kearney is playing his 44th career game he has never touched the ball this often in an entire game tonight three catches two runs scores the touchdown here he has two touchdowns in the game first two of his career and New Orleans takes the lead there they're gonna have to start doubleteam and Mike Carney here again a big fullback like that you can't sneak him out because they're playing him for the lead when they see him coming in I think it's going to be a run they think he's going to be the lead blocker and then he it's gone he goes out in the flat only carnies are allowed to score tonight here's John with his second point after so after the stop buyer pick this Saints marching again 14 to 7 New Orleans holiday season in the Metroplex the dallasfort Worth area that's the stadium new digs in the 2010 season outofbounds and that's not what you want at this particular point not what you want in any particular point to kick off a dibalans ramen company going to work for the 40 down by 7 looking for the next big play and what it has done is gave us confidence to go out to each and every week to make legs and that's what Tony brings to the technics very when talking about Roma theorists folks Romero and John Romo from Wisconsin where Tony grew up wound up going to Eastern Illinois he was not highly recruiting wasn't drafted signed by the Cowboys now in his fourth season and his time has come and this is Jones and his time has come as well with a 77 yard gain we're talking about Parcells and keeping everything in check what did he say the other the other day he said you know Cinderella can lose that shoe at any time and talking about Romo but you know clearly when you look at bills expression remember the exasperation the frustration has gone to almost ebullience not tonight yet but you know over the last few weeks you know we were talking about how much Tony Romo has helped the team the running game the offensive line the wide receivers he has also helped his head coach and we built ourselves is a totally different guy than he was when we did that Carolina Dallas man Jones to the 45 yard line and it's an amazing and it's an inseason turnaround in that giant game the way they performed that night and they lose and then they start out down 14 nothing to Carolina and that that's a season on the brink and now all of a sudden they've gone from a moribund season to one during which a lot of people think they're the best team in the conference yeah remember the game before Tony Romo started everyone was worried about Bill Parcells as players were calling them guys that coach whether were calling him Jim Burt his ex player came to the game cuz they her there's something wrong with him they said hey you're not the same guy you're not to Bill Parcells we know and then help shake them up a little on second and five that is little Smith who missed last week with a sprained ankle but he is back tonight in top form third year guy out of Ohio State their number one pick in old for sacking Romo and making it third and 15 yeah that's what the defensive end has to do is take a hard inside move when you see Will Smith do it on that play in fact he lines up on the tackle but he ended up going inside the left guard Kyle Kosar I think anytime you get you know a quarterback like Roman you want to get pressure on them right now it has to come from the inside and if your best pass rushers we get defensive end they have to take hard inside move nine and a half sacks warm Romo gets knocked down again and the issue was forced and Glen was the intended receiver and that was Will Smith again getting in almost raised a flag down I was just gonna say he didn't take an inside on that one he went outside and it will like anyone Blythe and on top of that it's a holding call on Andre gurad the center watch Will Smith he just comes from the outside here I don't think anyone blocked him see the tight end Witten he's kind of there but he doesn't block him and we'll gets a free run at Tony Romo Matt gets a free run at Tony Romo Matt McGuire leading the league in punting average with a small chance to held by Sammy Baugh and a flag is fun it's gonna be running into the kicker as a fair taxes made speed Gleeson the special teamer backup safety for the New Orleans Saints runs in two McBryan now the question is is this of what variety I don't think it can be a first down of any variety it'll be if it's a 15yard variety you know it could be very close but if it's the the fiveyard it's not going to be close to a first down because this is not an automatic first down right this is a fourth and 15 and that is the option they have in that situation 14 to 7 to Orleans today for the NFL man of the year somebody weighs me not only is having a great year but if he's a guy he goes into a difficult situation I mean it's not like recruiting guys to come to you know training camp in La Jolla in New Orleans we all know the story it's all part of the whole process the devastation the rebuilding but he cast his life there and then he embraced the city and the city is embraced him and along the way a lot of his teammates have bought into it as well and there is Tom Benson last year they were vagabonds of course with Katrina hitting at the end of August out they went to San Antonio and played their home games in San Antonio and some in Baton Rouge and a lot of people thought they'd never play in New Orleans again the fact they went to the Superdome they get Brees as a free agent he helps get Reggie Bush to feel a lot better about coming to New Orleans and they're 8 and 4 and had to leave tonight yeah Reggie Bush knew that when Drew Brees called him he said I felt ten times better about going to the New Orleans Saints and that's that's the that's what drew Brees exudes I mean that's who he is that's what he is you know he believes in it he believes in himself he believes in the saint he believes in Sean Payton and then he gets that across to the other players and they all believe in him and again it's you know it's small potatoes a football team in a situation you know with that whole region was just devastated but it's a little part of the process and for what it's worth and I just think it to lift his spirits and all of the rest and have the players in bracelets but the situation is in and it is great from the 17yard line breeze flows and the pass is incomplete intended for Billy Miller because in today's football you know you have to think about free agency you know and how are you going to get free agents don't want to go to New Orleans and I think it's quite getting guys like Drew Brees Brees and now they've got Bush in the way Sean Payton Asst has delivered in his first year and all of a sudden the team that was three and thirteen and nobody expected the Saints to be really a contender this year the next thing I know if they win tonight give you the number two seed in the conference at the moment remember when Reggie White went to Green Bay yep second and ten that connects his court lime juice McAlister is tackled there by Grady James sometimes it just takes you know a player a group of players you know to give credibility and then as you say you have to win I mean if they beat the Cowboys tonight then they go on and they get you know top seed they do well in the playoff who knows I mean this this is a heck of a launching point for thirtyfive DeMarcus Ware have to keep your eye on they run a draw and this time Dallas is able to defend it and stop them shy of the first down McAllister is across the 25 to the 26 yard line and it will be fourth down yeah I think one thing that they're going to do probably is start running Reggie Bush more inside it you know that they just get him outside and those screams and those kinds of plays and I could see there will be a situation someday where in a play like that third down you're gonna run a draw you put Reggie Bush back there and let him run the draw the rookie Weatherford to punt movement from the 24 and good coverage by the Saints special teams unit here is he's tackled at the 26 yard line six and a half remaining in the half Drew Bledsoe started the season as the Cowboys quarterback and lasted until halftime of the Giants games he had Bledsoe in for fiveandahalf Romo's now played six and a half so Owens is seeing the ball a lot more Glenn slightly less Witten considerably more and Patrick Crayton the third white out considerably more you know I feel that the cowboy offense had that one big plays Julius Jones they haven't gotten started yet and maybe they have to get back just like it's the start of the game get back to the running game get that going and then go off of that you know it's not an uphill fight yet you only 14:7 and it's Jones again a way that 77 you are and run earlier for the touchdown tripped up by Omar Stoudemire and that will be enough for a first down 10 yard gain out to the 37 yard line yeah and that's what I'm talking about I'm starting running the ball you see they have Fubini in here now is it tight in usually as I said earlier they put him in for protection purposes I think this could be the first time that they ran when they had to 3 tackle offense in there but I think that the Cowboys have to get back to running get back to a solid game for Jones with 106 yards tonight on 6 carries 77 on that one Romo by in time pump faking and then he's finally wrestled down by Scott Fujita and nobody could get free Romo is dangerous when he can improvise and get into the pocket and go to his right at that time the secondary did its work and Fujita knocks him down but I think that stuff's going to come later I mean like I said I don't think they've gotten there their offense started yet and you see McKenzie in the corner he's just out there waiting for everything I mean he was he was going to play a cover two and then he just comes in has a heck of a collision he takes carry Terry Glenn away in that first 5 yard there's no one one yard game as it turns out second down at the 38yard Lowell took his on a sign over the 40 Charles Grant makes the tackle you know you look at that Saints defense pretty good up front linebackers we have a couple of X Cowboys in there it's been a vulnerable secondary though John and you know as you look down the road is this the kind of defense that can get you through the playoffs you know again it's a little like the Colts and those types of things they can if their offense scores a lot of points and then yeah I think that's what drew Brees is doing tonight so far and the first asset that the Saints offense controls the ball keep the defense off the field does those kinds of things they can if you put all the pressure on the defense in a you have to win this for us there's no way they can third and six Romo rolling and that's juggled and not caught by Creighton the coverage pretty good by Mike McKenzie the xfactor who had two picks last week in the game against the 49ers so that st. defense given up that one big play but apart from that they've been very tough tonight yeah I think the Cowboys have really gotten away from the run and they're putting too much on Rome and I think they ought to go back the other way you know go back to establish the run making in there then the throwing will come believe me now Reggie Bush in college of course returned a lot of punts a lot of spectacular returns at USC back the hole this one in McBride with a booming bomb filled it at the 7 plus trying to get around the corner will never get there that is great beverage Miles Austin back there to knock him down at the 4 so a 52 yard punt yardage on the return of New Orleans backed up that was a great special teams play but I think right there he got away with a face masculine de unseen unfold yeah now they usually don't miss those things yeah not that kind look at his eyes you can clip that he knows if he got away with one yep Reggie Bush is explain that guy grab my face mask this is the kind of shot you don't put up on the board again that it goes against the home team first in ten from the fiveyard line Pierce McAllister but for the 28 yard line pieces given name is du Lamas Lamas jihad McAlister his high school coach if they deduce after David deuce Palmer receiver few years back with the dolphins and then he changed everything there's been he had made it official yeah I think the Vikings right not the the Dalton yep now he is he is deuce finally and he's not back to 100% yet I mean he's playing he's playing well but he's not the old piece the time second and seven and is in McAlester again coming up about two yards shy the first up to the 13 where he's tackled by incan adele 315 to go in the opening half and I like what Sean Payton is doing here this first half better than what the Cowboys are doing I mean he seems to have a plan and you know he he had some bad field position but he just kind of stuck with it stayed with the running game you're mixed up play action class they control got an excellent job of Crakehall love the way he puts Sunday night football on the card and quotes that's cool third down and one from the 14 he's rolling hitting Marcus Colston for a first down so Colston they didn't know he was going to play didn't practice this week miss last week's game and the seventh round pick from Hofstra has cost five walls tonight for 51 yards this is an interesting play Drew Brees is going to come out to this side and he has three layers he has a short he has a medium and he has a deep and the deep one is a guy he picked Colston Bullock yeah no I was just gonna say it looked like when he first came out there that he was going to throw the short one the Reggie Bush just to get the first down from the 26 yard line come facilitate the trade of Donte Stallworth here's Bush and Reggie Bush gets in behind his blocker and picks up a first down he gets right in behind John Stinchcomb the X Raider and follows him for enough of a game to pick up a first down twominute warning Saints with the ball in the sevenpoint lead show mention that John Stinchcomb his brother Matt the former Raider started the season with Oakland but right now I'm not in the league John is the younger brother both about 6 6 and 315 and this is deuce mcallister on first down taking it out to about the 43 yard line jeff fain loses his helmet there was Jay Ratliff that did that I think his Geoff faint in there watch him there's Ratliff and he's getting the push he takes his right hand and just pushes right up under fain but you have to like feint he stays with the blocks and I mean you know I mean anyone could block with her hat on but walking with your hat off second down and five Brie's stepping up throws on the run hits bush in the Dallas territory he goes to the 31 yard line and so Drew Brees steps away from trouble avoids the sack and turns what would have been a loss into a 24 yard game thanks of course to getting it into the hands of Reggie Bush and that's a timeout here for the New Orleans Saints they have one left and 67 seconds up 147 without playing the role of position and had every it had the look of a guy with a cramp and that was what they did Messiah stood out of Colston but of course when you down and you have to take an injury timeout you must come out for at least one place he'll be on the bench here on second down and 10 and that because of the injury they are forced to take the time out there and they are out of them here but they're still at 62 seconds and it's second down and 10 at the 32yard line we're usually outside and that is caught by Deborah Henderson is a flag as Henderson spun away from the moment gets the first down what the call is going to go against the Saints drew brees brought him in in a blitz and you think then when you get in this situation you can anticipate win because they want to knock you out of field goal range you get in that position in the field so you're going to you're going to go and you're going to get the Blitz and then you're going to get one on one but they had a penalty here this this is a thing that a rookie has to do we know that Reggie Bush can can run the ball and we know he can catch it we know he can do all those things but to be in every down bat you have to be ready to pass propel that's not bad mentally moves him out of field goal range second and 20 brief tries to get him back into range and he does and then the ball came loose for the moment that's demobbed Jones making the catch his first of the game the official is looking at each other to make sure that it was a catch they'll try to snap it before the replay guys upstairs and said we want to look at it and it appears that they did get the play off that's one of those things where you know it's going to be looked at carefully upstairs was it stopped in time is the question the right and Bill Parcells is out in the field but again we know there's nothing that he can do about it now you can't throw a challenge like you're inside two minutes so it is simply up to the replay official to determine whether he wants to stop the play or not here's what Austin has to say about it play is being challenged before the snap Challenge game official review this matter it's not a challenge can't have a coaches challenge so the official upstairs did stop it before breeze could spike it and they'll see whether this is a catch or not again take a look here this is Jones making the catch one foot down gets hit by Brady James in comes Williams the ball begins to come loose did he get the second foot down because if he did he had that's a catch and then he lose the ball but recover the ball so it would still be New Orleans ball and the play would count and it would take the ball all the way down to the 20yard line you know the other question I had is did the review get in before they snapped the ball and then you know if it did or didn't how do you know well you know it's it's Jerry Austin said they do I think the replay officials now know that this is what's going to happen if you have any sort of controversy the team that might get the short end of the stick will get up if they're on offense and try to snap the ball before they can call that so I think what's happening now you're seeing it more and more is the replay guys will call down the hope well that's it isn't that something so they're gonna think they they in effect win the result here but then Parcells by throwing the challenge flag that is unsportsmanlike conduct inside two minutes so now they're going to march off the penalty against the Cowboys so here's Parcells who clearly wants to stop the action but you can't you can't throw the flag and the coaches know that inside two minutes and if you do you're gonna get an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty anyway I talked to Mike Pereira about that the head of officials and he thought that coaches were just throwing the flag out there when they knew they couldn't just to either do like this talk to the referee or get an extra timeout so they were going to make a penalty out of this they'll tell you that the you know that took him out of field goal range and then and then that penalty was a big penalty because it put him in field goal range and it's going to make it third down and five and Gerry Austin is a guy who's reversed 43% of coaches challenges in his career in effect he has the ultimate say over that the replay booth can stop it but he overturns more coals than any current referee in terms of percentage of overturned pools with drew Brees is thinking now as you'd like to get a little closer you know maybe pick up 10 or 15 yards then go for a shot for the end zone and then have you field goal 8 if you need it New Orleans does not have a timeout Brees throws over the middle that's caught at the 6 yard line Liz Jones again for the touchdown or do that Wow if they drew Brees or something I mean he is so cool and he is so good in this situation this 2 minute situation he is special Bill Parcells standing there with his arm thrust knew that he gave him 15 yards of pretty good field position but Drew Brees did what he had to do Jamal Jones and what is Jamal Jones doing in there he's in the game because Colston got hurt I mean think about this that's Jones's first touchdown Mike Carney the fullback has two touchdowns tonight John Carney has his third extra point and the New Orleans Saints out on the road against a redhot team trailing seven to nothing have scored 21 unanswered points and lead 21 to 7 you're gonna see here's here's Roy Jones here he's in a single safety Roy Williams and and he's back there in a single sent to safety they have five receivers it's just a zone Jones runs right to that hole in the zone Roy Williams misses a tackle now that could be a four point miss tackle right there if he if he tackles him there you know they could stop him and make him settle for a field goal but Drew Brees is up to them by the way he has five receivers out there he looks looks looks fine Jones sitting down there in the middle of that zone and hits him perfectly Brees has already thrown for 199 yards that's a 95 yard drive earlier an 88yard drive they have out gained the Cowboys by better than a twotoone ratio Williams listening the tackle 44 seconds remaining in the half Dallas will have all of its timeouts and in a 14point hole Miles Austin from the to bypass the 30 gives it a good run back up to the 39 yard line so 37 seconds and all of their timeouts and now they have those receivers I'm anything you know Terrell Owens maybe you have to get him involved Terry Glenn do you need you know you'll get a couple of plays here because you know they need a wake up call I mean I think the you know Cowboys offenses kind of sleepwalking out there and they haven't gotten started they haven't gotten anything started I think I think you know and it's not a time now but I think they left their running game too soon and they'll probably get back for that at the start of the third quarter here now they have to spread them out and they need a couple of big play and the passing game nonexistent Romo is 2 out of 7 for 20 three out of eight Glenn takes it up to the 47 yard line and they will take a timeout so Ramos completed three passes tonight and Brees has completed 19 to 8 different receivers and they don't even have Joel Horne in uniform tonight every don't you feel that Sean Payton has done an excellent job of calling plays tremendous Tony Romo there are his numbers right up to the moment three out of eight with a pick drew brees meanwhile closing in on 200 yards for the half two touchdowns Julius Jones had that 77 yard burst even the extent of Dallas offense Mike Carney the fullback comes out of nowhere to become an offensive threat with two touchdowns Jamal Jones gets into the game because Colston gets hurt and he scores and in New Orleans Saints have played nearperfect last 22 minutes of the half don't you like the way drew Brees competes on loss but this guy's a football player but he may only be six foot and you know and not have he'll be the perfect NFL body quarterback but he's the perfect NFL mind and armed quarter ball start 62 that's Rivera and of all things if Drew Brees doesn't get hurt at the end of the season last year San Diego Denver and he had a torn labrum and had major shoulder surgery he is and he feels he would be he's probably a San Diego charger this year and Phillip Rivers are still on the bench right and then and then what happens to Phillip Rivers right here and they won't get after the Drew Brees next door second down from the 41 yard line Tony Romo trying to get that anointing oil back out and put away the SAP throws into a lot of traffic intended for Owens who wants a flag but will not get one Mike McKenzie with the coverage and that's going to make it third down and eight and then all of a sudden you get a flag that comes in about five seconds later I tell you a 21 to 7 lead will give a defensive line well that's Mike McKenzie and that's something that it would get a coach nuts right I mean of all the things that the Saints didn't need at this time was a taunting penalty I mean you got them it's an incomplete pass just go back and huddle up you don't need this you don't have to talk to him you don't have to say a word that's no I don't know every that yeah yeah I know you know compete is one thing play like heck isn't unit is a rather than this don't want use your brain as to eat it I need to take a timeout here and they will it'll be second down and eight the ball is at the 42 Grammatik is the field goal kicker so he's gonna need a little more yardage here maybe about 15 yeah I mean and that's that's the area that 12 to 15 yards you wanna you want to hit that to get dramatic I mean you hit something on the board here at the end get a little momentum because like I say I mean they get off to a great start with Julius Jones's run but after that it's kind of like they they threw the whole thing in neutral New Orleans better than a twotoone advantage time the possession look at that in terms of plays they run 44 to Dallas's 19 that's what the quarterback does he looks at at those images there and that's that's the defense that the Cowboys are using and they take a picture at the snap and right after the slant the Drew Brees is looking to see publish their formation second down and eight the ball is at the 42 yard line well.all gets protected five yard line that's Glenn that's a first down and Dallas has to spend its final timeout now you've got 11 seconds you get into range for a gramática field goal with that reception so now it's about a 43 yard attempt but you have time to run another play assuming you either get it into the end zone or get it and take it out of bounds because I doubt they're gonna have time to get up there and spike it now I would just try if they're going to run one play before they attempt a field goal I'd try a fade I think you have to throw it in the end zone I wouldn't I wouldn't take the chance of having to get up there and Spike it right I've always thought the safest place to throw that in the end zone is the is a back of the end zone if you throw the ball to the back pylon whether either your guy gets it or no one gets you I think that's the safest and the perfect player if you throw to the back pylon right here he's not the front of the end zone with the back of the pile the back to the end zone Glenn and Creighton go to the right Terrell Owens has not caught a pass tonight and there he is to the left with eleven chicks and no time outs wall mow the pump fake and there he goes toward that back pylon and incomplete because Mackenzie's coverage was very good on Terry Glenn and now in comes grammatica to try to make it an 11point game I think I would have chosen the other side he had single coverage over here down in the bottom with Terrell Owens and and it was pretty good coverage but it was single and I think I would have taken my chances with tio dramatic of course has been around he was with New England and training camp and he was out on the street and he plays Mike Vanderjagt and this is a 43 yard attempt that is no good wide it to the right and there is still one tick left in the time for I don't know maybe sayers it out here who knows ball comes back to the 33 yard line left it out he just pushed it was on the left hash mark and he pushed it pushed it to the outside of the the outside of the end zone on the outside of the gulper st. scored on a Hail Mary against the Bengals at the end of the first half for about a month to go but this time they settle for the meal down and they settle for that 14point lead any great performance by breeze in this first half 190 I'm 217 Bob in the game toy the halftime show on the other side of this bridge Toyota halftime show brought to you by Toyota moving forward in New York with sterling Jerome and Chris I'm Bob let's take a look at some of the highlights from today beginning in the NFC we'll also check the playoff picture in each conference so we'll roll it first from Carolina where the Giants came in as losers have four in a row but Eli Manning had a good day no interceptions three touchdown passes including this one two plex ago Burris covering 28 yards the Giants beat the Panthers 27:13 in Washington Jeff Garcia continues his hot ways this 60 yard pass to Reggie bounds gonna set up a Garcia to Donte Stallworth touchdown they would eventually make it 21 3 the Eagles go on to win at 21 19 and they've taken two out of three now with Garcia as their quarterback since McNabb went out these are the standings in the NFC East Dallas of course we don't know the outcome of the game we're going back there for the second half against the Saints the Giants back in it and Philadelphia at 7 and 6 some people counted them out but that's not the case they're still alive in Tampa injuries to work done and Jarius Norwood man thick justin griffith the fullback got a chance watch this move yeah ah there you go that one mated 14 6 Atlanta Atlanta wins at 17 6 over Tampa OK in the NFC South the Saints at 8 and 4 pending the outcome of the game in Dallas Atlanta right back in it for a wild card and maybe for the division title Carolina is hanging by a thread in the NFC North the Bears have the biggest lead and in fact they have clinched the biggest lead in any division Minnesota still has a wild card chance because 6 &amp; 7 doesn't eliminate you in the NFC maybe the best game of the day in Arizona on 4th down and 20 Matt Hasselbeck is going to hit Deion Branch who needs to get it to about the 6 and he comes up one yard short Arizona holds on 27 21 Seattle still with a comfortable lead in the NFC West and st. Louis in San Francisco just about out of it st. Louis plays at home tomorrow night against the Bears the overall NFC playoff situation looks like this beginning with the division leaders and of course the Bears have already clinched if the playoffs were to begin today the wild cards would go to the Giants and the Eagles and those on the bubble include the Falcons the Vikings the Panthers and the Rams if only there when we come back we will switch conferences breaking down the AFC playoff pitcher when the Toyota halftime show returns in less than a minute of UCLA and now with the Jaguars is the winner okay on now to the AFC for highlights and the playoff picture will begin in San Diego where the Chargers clinched the AFC West and sent them reeling Broncos to their fourth consecutive defeat LaDainian Tomlinson did it again that time from a yard out later from the six and then late in the fourth quarter he sports for the third time on the day from seven yards out 29th TD of the year to just 13 games breaking the year old record set by Sean Alexander of the Seahawks he might at this pace wind up in the mid30s just astonishing what LaDainian Tomlinson has done and go to the standings in the AFC West as we said San Diego has clinched Kansas City and Denver still clinging to wild card hopes in Kansas City today with the Chiefs rarely lose in the month of December Steve McNair said you're losing today guys as he chunks this when 87 yards down the field Mark Clayton goes in and Baltimore knocks off the cheese twenty to ten and they are in control in the AFC North with an eye now towards possibly getting one of the top two seeds in the conference if the season were to end today Cincinnati would claim one of the wildcard births and Pittsburgh has not yet mathematically eliminated how about the game in Jacksonville and how about the game for Maurice jonesdrew 303 allpurpose yards including this 48 yard touchdown and Jacksonville blowers are the Colts 44:17 Indy has lost three out of four so they were once a shooin for a bye and homefield advantage throughout now they're in a dogfight not for the division but for the top seed in the conference Jacksonville would have one of the wildcards today in New York the Jets are supposed to have the easiest schedule right I don't think so taking on the Buffalo Bills Nate Clemens going to pick off this pass from Chad Pennington returns at 58 yards for the touchdown and Buffalo with the upset 31:13 over the Jets so since the Pats lost at Miami today the Jets could have moved to within a game of the top and the division had they won they did not so the Lincoln still has the twogame lead and the Jets are on the bubble when it comes to the wild card situation there are your division leaders Cincinnati and Jacksonville would have the wild cards the Jets the Chiefs and the Broncos are hoping okay as we bring in Jerome and Sterling what about a sleeper team in either conference well in the NFC for me would be the Minnesota Vikings I know you're saying Brad Johnson isn't playing well he's not but they have a good defense they've got a great schedule the rest of the way at home against the Jets away Green Bay at home against st. Louis solid defense a good rushing offense I think they can still sneaking the play well I think of the in the AFC it has to be six and seven Tennessee and the reason I say that this bench young is extending drives especially on third down with his legs where he's carried the football 27 of his 69 carries on third down keep that offense on the field and he's finding ways to win football games at the end three straight comfortable from behind win and after Nolan five stars he had won six of eight Chris come on guys the sleepers the Dallas Cowboys did you watch the best amount yeah and Tony Romo is starting to get a little bit of a feel now of what it's going to be like the played for Bill Parcells when things aren't going so well I bet you he's getting an earful it out though I always got a full Hef to turn it around we'll see if he can as we go back to a love John and Dallas after this break and we'll see you next week it's big you know stage four it is set we want to win for the guy next to us and it's I think it's a special bobbin more that's helped us get to this point and things aren't going the way you really want them to go you make adjustments a second half you don't come back out there and do the same thing it's just for and trying to make it work as the game goes on you see a lot of guys a lot of teams mentally breakdown and that can hurt you in the long run so it's always a measuring measuring stick when you're playing the number one offense in the league we're playing well right now they're playing well it makes par there's no better time for us to meet with some guys walk Rhino said oh this is a big we got to get this one well you know what you're right and next week as you mean they get bigger and bigger and bigger until you get to the ultimate piglet and right now we come back to Texas Stadium the NFC seating situation at the moment Bears play the Rams tomorrow night in st. Louis 10:00 to 2:00 at the moment whenever this game would be the second seed because the Seahawks have lost so the winner here goes to 9 &amp; 4 the loser goes to 8 and 5 waiting for the smoke to clear it's about the stoop I got to say it's the stupidest thing in sports there are pyrotechnics now with every pregame show halftime show it's doubly stupid in indoor arenas in the NBA and NHL and this whole place was just full of small few minutes ago because some garbage at hand cons and you know you say it once and hopefully I'm wrong but it's a disaster waiting to happen this is Boston that past the 20 to the 28 yard line we check in with Andrea we can see through the haze Andrea injury up the sense titan mark Campbell is expected is questionable please return he has a left knee sprain but wide receiver Marcus Colston has cramps is expected to return now remember Shawn payee was Tony Romo's quarterback coach for three years here in Dallas so I asked him what his defense has done that no one else has this season he said they're doing a great job of keeping him in the pocket where he can't get outside and make his big place Tony Romo in that first they have 4 of 11 444 yards Owens hasn't thought of past wins caught three together the Jones who at that 77 yard run and that's been the extent of the Dallas offense up to the 31 numbers through the first 30 minutes of course it's dominated by the Saints apart from that that one run by Jones breezed with 199 yards plus losing seven on the sacks of 192 net passing and twotoone time of possession the Saints had a a great game plan they just kept the ball away from the Cowboys and I think really the Cowboys are putting too much on Tony Romo and he's filling a firstyear quarterback maybe he wasn't usin work he can't take everything on his shoulders yet second and seven Roma throws and wide open his Glenn his fourth catch of the night and playing inside the 30 the 25 to the 20 yard line they'll spotted at the 19 and the crowd has something to cheer about for the first time since the Jones touchdown run and that's what they needed them and it needed something to get him started I mean here you see Terry Ghent Glen comes in motion then he goes all the way back across the field where he started from again Terrell Owens makes a pretty good block there for him because he hasn't caught any passes so he figures I have to do something to contribute in this game but before it's over I think tio is going to be a pretty big part of it booty with a 50 yard gain Miss Jones gain of 30 taking it down to the 16 yard line the Cowboys haven't had enough time of possession to even get to Mary and Barbara you know they have that onetwo punch Julius Jones runs and runs and then they bring in Marion Barber and he does a running and you know they haven't they haven't had any continuity where they can do those things and I'm sure that's what Bill Parcells talked about at halftime Roma who had 44 passing yards before that 50 yard in the Glen rolling to his right where he's been dangerous and finally hits Owen so Owens makes his first catch of the night steps out of bounds very close to the first down marker at the 9 yard line yeah and that's the thing that you have to do at halftime you have to think you know what can we do with them here you know you know start on my one side bring them emotion bring them across the field get them on and out do something to get him the ball change it just don't leave them in the same place all the time where the defense can just focus on and that is a first down they spotted at the 8 yard line first and goal James next up to Julius to the six second down I'm sure this is the you know type of thing that the Cowboys really wanted to do all along is not just you know pass pass pass and have an interception turn over and let the the Saints keep the ball they wanted the time to possession they wanted good mixture you'll get their run going then they can do the play pass then Tony Romo can get outside the pocket and get in a rhythm of the game Tony Romo in this cowboy offense hasn't gotten into any rhythm yet tonight second and goal rolling left against the grains going back through the middle incomplete trying to jam it in to jason witten it'll be third and gold you know that's one thing that he could do I mean he can throw on the run as well as anyone and it doesn't always have to be to his right and he can go left and turn and throw that ball like that with a lot of velocity I'm linked Tony Romo does this as well as anyone step up and throw the ball and again you say well it's a little away from Jason Witten but was also away from the defender and he put that ball where he had to third down and goal from the six and he's the back field out of the shotgun he receivers to the left and through to the right looking running throwing incomplete and lucky it wasn't picked off that's Mike Mackenzie who had two interceptions last week that pass intended for Patrick Crayton so they get the 50yard strike to Glenn then Owens makes his first catch they have a first and goal but have to settle for a gramatica field goal attempt and that's the one that he's going to kind of force it here and you see Mike McKenzie he has a position there in fact he runs a better pattern than a receiver Creighton does the crate has to be more physical you know the wide receivers when you get down in the goal and you have to be as physical as a line 24yard attempt for gramatica is good so he misses one at the end of the first half makes one here the lead is 11 Saints on top 21 210 ribs I don't know where that is jumbo we're going right after the game bad Michael Lewis to run a fire to the 27 yard line the group raised was something special in that first half and that was the ball handling one here again you go playaction pass but look how quickly he gets off it and gets to his receiver here he just had great vision upfield Mount Jones right there in the middle of his zone and Roy Williams missed the tackle the Drew Brees has put on quite a show in that first half as in the 26 for these clothes and it's party you play such a big role in the first thing talked about drew brees before remember San Diego wound up with Phillip Rivers as part of the Manning deal after the 2004 draft and River sent on the bench because Brees ascended and became a star in San Diego and then it became a case of what do you do if the Chargers well it made it easier for the Chargers to elevate rivers and give him the good deal and let breeze go because Brees tore his labrum at the end of last season the party first down when Johnny was talking last night about the recruiting trip he went to Miami but they were gonna pass on him because it was shoulder he said they opted for daunte culpepper and his you know reconstructed knee and that's another story the breeze goes there and then Sean Payton among other things just taking him out for a tour of the town and gets lost and gets lost yeah and he's he's showing us an area where he lived and then he didn't know how to get back and he was lost but you know he's the head coach he's the captain who said he doesn't want to talk drew brees with white they called Nicki loofah see the general manager and he starts getting directions rook and here's Bush and the Heisman Trophy winner off to the races again inside the twenty touched it touchdown Anthony Henry had the angle on him and Bush made it look so simple just cutting to his right touchdown Saints I bet you're Reggie Bush's making this whole league look too simple out and when Heath does that I know what Bill Parcells is thinking here he is he's in the backfield and he just throws him out a little screen out there a good block there a pretty good block there with the rest as Reggie Bush he runs out of a tackle there makes a move on two guys right there boy is he fun to watch honey he's fun to watch for every fan except if you're a fan of the Houston Texans and every Texan fan has to be saying one in the hell did we do after the draft hey I want this guy on my team fire first pick I'm picking Reggie Bush I don't even Wow here's carnie for the point after well four touchdowns last week on the board the night the Saints like this thing are for real 28 pair as a rookie running back with the 49ers in 1980 the year before they began their great run but Bush is on it a pace to get into triple figures of course the hospital buns the ball about ten times again normally a little bit more time he's only carried three times a private guy with this just full of life and energy in Vegas plump for everyone to be around Miles Austin to run it back then again a good 2:38 reading a story today about you know Reggie Bush's jersey sales number one in the NFL right now let's go to Andrea I'm gonna go buy one yeah well I can tell you Bill Parcells it's not gonna go by one because he is just heads had a stun look on his face on the sidelines and he was stunned when he talked to me at halftime he said we took a bad beating in the first half we have to take our time and be patient of course this is before that Bush touchdown and he completely scoffed at any notion that Sean Payton's familiarity with Tony Romo is why they're playing such good defense on him there you go back here you know Romo and Peyton with the Eastern Illinois can I've seen him Sean his position close here over the last three years Ronald off the play fake throwing caught by Glenn at the 42 of New Orleans and he takes it to the 35 Fujita stops him there and there'll be a little more alacrity to this Dallas attack now as they get up and huddle up yeah I just got a feeling that the Dallas Cowboy offense just never got started I don't know I mean there was great defense I think that was you know time of possession they didn't have the ball and then when they they did have it they didn't get anything going quickly and I think they kind of got away from their running game although his barber has been such a big part of that run a game recently but tonight he's been limited to next to nothing tackled air by Fujita Barber has become the guy who's seen the the brunt of the ball carrying of way he's seen more action Jones less but tonight Jones is carried 10 times and that's Barbara's first tote and barbers a guy that usually you know goes north and south takes the ball hits it in there quickly is you know a tough type of runner and he runs a lot of those third down draws to so I think that's one of the reasons he's going to have a better average second down and one more my eyes time has to check off underneath caught Witten tackled there by Grant the defensive end covering the tight end short game third native coming yeah you look at me in the first half with Terrell Owens and Fred Thomas I thought they were gonna work on Fred Thomas and they they started to it but he's done a good job on Tara Lola I mean you see the coverage here you say why haven't they thrown to Terrell Owens well Fred Thomas is discovered of pretty well if Fred time is the guy has been picked on a lot of weight to 5/9 185 had eleventh year cornerback usually about the six inches to Orleans I think they have to get to the inside and cross and stuff that's where this defense is all over reflected that is incomplete and to distort that and Kwan the lake the tackle put the pressure on that time only Ramos saying he wants to go for it here and it's like Bill Parcells says okay and like I was saying they had trouble just keeping their wide receivers outside and getting up the field and the success they've had of those big routes or those deep end or crosses and I think if they have to come up with a play now it should be one of those crosses would be pin 18point deficit mid third quarter if you miss a field goal 52 yards you give me the ball at the 42 you might as well go for it four thousand eight almost stepping away from pressure thrown and that spot bio is what a break for the Cowboys on what should have been an interception it looked like a Fred comest pick at least it be knocks it down it's fourth down and they turn it over on downs instead it's an early Christmas gift for number 81 I was just talking about these seat pins and you're gonna see Terrell Owens right up here and this is the deep end he starts there and he's coming in Tony Romo throws a ball but he throws it right to Fred Thomas and I noticed it in fact that was a double cutaway Thomas has a thumb injury you can see that right thumb his rap wouldn't make the pick couldn't lock it down and Dallas gets back in the game 28:17 Fred Thomas destroy it on the sidelines because he had a chance to pick it off at least knock it down instead the deflection goes into the hands of Owens talked about that thumb injury and that was severe enough to keep him out of the game against Pittsburgh on the 12th of November he does not have an interception this season and the Cowboys have turned it into an 11point game the newest to run it back newest a pass to 30 coming back from knee surgery last year up to the 38 yard line and we go back to the touchdown pass you know I'm not sure we saw a Fred Thomas it looks like he has a cast on that thumb and the ball went right through his hands and you know it's tough and you can see you know he's saying how in the heck did that thing get through there but it's tough to play when you have a cast on your hand but that his coverage has been pretty good against Terrell Owens and again that was that was a place they had to go I thought I you know on the end of the cross and they win on the end and Fred Thomas ran it as well as Terrell Owens did speaking of hand injuries we were here for the second week of the season and Owens broke a finger and had surgery that didn't cost him any time he has plates on his hand when an African he was able to those are the 38yard toss deuce mcallister runs right through the middle some tough running the inside up to the 45yard line tacking tackle by econ adele the one thing the Cowboys have to be thinking about now is getting some some pass rush on first and second down and maybe doing that maybe they widen their ends a little and then maybe that opens up the inside run for deuce mcallister because I know you know they have to talk about at halftime you know we have to get to Drew Brees we have to put pressure on them we have to get to them on first and second down they haven't been doing douche again stop them a little short of the first down or did they know they're gonna spot it at the 48 they have a nice little spot there that's nice enough for a first down I like the combination that Sean Payton has here you know the way you know he'll you'll run do some McAllister inside you know and then you'll get the ball to Reggie Bush outside then you forget about his fullback Mike Carney and you'll give him a run or you'll throw him the ball in the flat and to me it's great mixture along with your wide receivers there goes Bush and motion to fake the McAllister the fake to Bush the deep pass he's caught on the run by Devery Henderson and he takes it inside the five yard line on targets more than 30 yards from the line of scrimmage the season breeze is not 10 out of 13 for 50 yard what a playaction that is when you could fake two McAllister then you can fake to Reggie Bush and then you could throw the ball to your speed guy Henderson all the way across the field and Roy Williams nearly hoarse Collins him at the end but there's no flag and it'll be first and goal of the two and Drew Brees put that one in there perfectly they give us a McCallister and he stalked just short of the goal line second down and though bought a it Payton has done a fabulous job of play calling them they're right he's really kept this Dallas Cowboy defense offbalance you know when when they think he's gonna run he fakes a run and throws when they think he's gonna throw he runs when I think it's gonna be a tailback he gives it to the quarterback and and the cowboy defense has been on their heels there goes geese for the touchdown I think goose learn that from her Reggie Bush we were talking to him last night about it we said yeah he jumps a lot and says most guys go to that second down now there was a whistle before the play which nobody heard in Jerry Austin comes in and signals I assume a false start now I would assume with you a false start or not yeah that's what I would assume didn't hear the whistle never heard the announcement it's going to be an illegal substitution is what they're telling us that he said you go upstairs in the reflected we're checking with them they don't know what the second and goal Greece grows crying again and he is taken out of bounds he's already scored twice tonight he stinkles touch them for a guy who'd never had one in his career but he's well short of it a yard anyway well carny knows a rule that the goal line goes around the world so the ball doesn't have to be inside that pylon and that's what he was trying to say that that I broke thee I broke the plane of the goal line even even though it was outside I don't know that was that was pretty close wasn't it very close by the way the penalty was on Zach Strief who did not report as an eligible receiver at the end of the line meanwhile Payton is out on the field and now he knows the guys are upstairs are telling him you might want to challenge this call and that's what it will be he's going to challenge it to see if it's a touchdown so the challenge is successful and I guess Carney does know about the goal line for a guy who hadn't scored in his career now 44 games old he has the hattrick tonight as he as long as his feet or his body are inbound the ball when it crosses a plane does not have to be inbound the pylon is out of bounds but as we say the goal line goes around the world so it's just extended as long as he crosses the goal line before he is down no matter where the ball is and you can wave you your empty hand over it and have the ball well out of bounds in effect it's still a touchdown right as long as your body's inbound karni for the point after open the eyes if this guy would score three touchdowns tonight 20 million to 135 17 now Michaels John man names for Kramer Irving and an onside kick attempt here does it go 10 yards as it was Billy Cundiff who kicks he has to go ten yards before the kicking team touches the ball Jay Bellamy winds up with it and the officials have yet to signal who has possession I'll tell you the old the old pupils trying to run it in then the teacher isn't he kickers touched at all after the gong ten yards and recovered it it will be in New Orleans ball first and ten you bet yeah nobody touches it until it gets past the 40yard line once it reaches the 40 then a saint can touch it which they do it goes off somebody's foot and then it's collected there by Bellamy and boy I'm telling you yeah 35 to 17 and you go for an onside kick that's a gutsy call Sean Payton has made a couple of them tonight that you'll force someone sidekick here Marcus Colston he is the receiver here but maybe he knows that right now he has a momentum and there's no way that he's going to give it to Parcells he has it and he says we got it we have everything going and we're going to keep it we're gonna onside kick and we're gonna keep going here Sean Payton is coaching in his 13th NFL game I don't know that I've seen a better coached game to this point in time there's a lemon he's that great mixture and great play calling him of course he has the guy there pulling the trigger was clear wouldn't do breeze tonight second down in five what we knew about the sings come in and you about breeze you knew about bush okay McAllister is sort of a proven commodity you knew about Joe horn he's not even here tonight okay Colston a seventh round draft choice he was he was hurt but he's playing but how about Mike Carney Jamal Jones who's Kaiser scored four touchdowns between them who are they but but that's the thing once you get it going and once you know played ball in and do you get it rolling and you're gonna spread the ball around and you have a real played quarterback you can do those kinds of third down and five breathe underneath this is Billy Miller the tight end might as well get everybody into the act Billy Miller playing because mark Campbell the starting tight end got hurt and here's I mean the Saints among other things working through a number of injuries or any con well the number one tight end he's hurt he's out then they lose Campbell tonight and Miller comes in but isn't this something this this Saint team I mean they go you know from a you know feelgood story they want a few game they're eight and four they come in here to Dallas to you know everyone thought Dallas you'll come in is probably the best team in the NFC and if these guys come out they're not a feelgood story anymore now first and ten so they're a feelgood plus and that is caught by Henderson in between two Cowboys and before they can touch him he's into the end zone for a touchdown every Henderson he's their big play guy yeah I mean all those guys you mentioned them Jill Henderson is a guy if you're going to get a deep one you try and get him to ball deep Sean Payton is thinking right now it all worked you know I score a touchdown I go for an onside kick I get that and then I get the big play Drew Brees is thrown for 384 yards he's a Texas kid he grew up in Austin he led his team to the state championship in the stadium ten years ago he is used to Friday Night Lights tonight at his Sunday night lights out what a performance there that was a great pass by Drew Brees against the cover too John Carney to the point after and with 347 left in the third quarter the number one offense in the league has rolled up 42 points on the Dallas Cowboys we're going to see here's what it looks like here's Anderson right here now we're going to get a cover to where the corner comes up and hits here the safety comes over Drew Brees is going to hit him right in hole right in front of the safety behind the corner there's a window right in here and watch Henderson down here in the bottom he gets by the first guy see the window right there group before Keith Davis the safety can get over there here's a route you see right up there Henry is trying to hit him and then he gets away from that then he comes under control a little because he knows that the next guy is going to be the safety coming over Keith Davis and that was a heck of a throw by Drew Brees but that was a good route by Henderson and you know and getting away from the Anthony Henry and then finding that hole coming under control a little in that hole drew brees had shoulder surgery in January for month rehab he in Alabama had it done by the noted the surgeon James Andrews inlaws live in Alabama so he was able to get down there and stay down there for the rehab Miles Austin to run this back and he loses the football but it's picked up by Elam and Abram Elam is tackled at the 33yard line coming into tonight Romo was first Brees was fourth there'll be a big change after the game here because 158 and change is a perfect rating so breeze is 146 point three and Romo seventy three point eight a lot of that is that 50yard pass the Glenn but drew brees has been close to perfect tonight enemies if the short ones is if the medium ones he's hit the deep one the ten different receivers Rommels gonna launch one there's a flag down and Owens will draw another flag because that was Thomas again who appeared to be beaten on the place you have a flag down all the way up field near the 50yard line and then a flag came in at the end of the play two separate issues here and that's kind of what we thought you know that the Cowboys would do is work on Fred Thomas over there with Terrell Owens and I still think the thing that they have to do rather than those ups are just running straight up the field because Fred Tom on the defense automatic first down but again I think they have to the only thing that they called is illegal contact here he's passed five yards now he can't touch him he gets his arm in there that's what they called there and then they didn't call pass interference there obviously he threw the flag right there I thought he did too that's what I'm confused about and he can't if he threw the flag back there at that time that had to be pass interference because the first one had to be hitting him after five yards and we saw that then the second flag would have been passed into Ference of course the ball would be right there with a passing defense curve you assume now they're telling us they decided there was no passionate person despite the flag being thrown it was picked up okay everything's afterthefact with mystery tonight on first and ten and Thomas is right with them yeah I know what they're trying to do and I keep going back that the Thomas is covering that well okay you you know you've proved you know we're trying to get the ball lowens we're trying to take a shot to them we're trying to get it to them deep but you don't have to just run up the field with them I think the place to run with Owens is maybe bring them in motion maybe bring them across the field on a deep crossing pattern or again going back to that deep end because they've they've proven right now that they can't just put them out there and run enough on that second and from the 37 and that is taught by Glenn right in the middle of traffic we knew he was going to get popped and Fred Thomas makes the tackle and that will be enough for a first down yeah and that was the the deep end of Terry Glenn and they had Terrell Owens in the slot on that one and he ran and in also in fact he was wide open so he had and in from the outside receiver right there Terry Glenn and just inside of him also running an in pattern with Terrell Owens let's get four 18 yards win six matches tonight normal has only ten computers only to score too Jones first and before he gets slim that abounds by Josh Bullock's you know one of the things that this st. defense wanted to do and they've done an excellent job is to keep Tony Romo in the pocket I mean he's you know he's pretty efficient in the pocket but he's really he's really deadly when he'd get outside and and they've had great containment on him and they made him you know just throw from ribbons with him stay in the pocket not let him get out and buy extra time because when he gets out and buys extra time that's when his wide receivers a lot and who would know that better than Sean Payton to work with him every day for three years first and ten to the outside and Glenn gets free and makes the catch at the 19 yard line he's tackled there by Jason craft out of the pocket and they do keep numbers on that as well as everything else he's the highest rated passer coming into the game in the league when you get him outside the pocket so he's number one outside the pocket Brees is number one out of the shotgun and I think that's you know this st. defense realize daddy I think their defensive ends and tackles pushing up the middle have done a good job of not letting Roma the pocket he throws what makes the catch Whitman breaks a couple of tackles though on his feet and then plunges forward to about the 12 yard line Tony Romo is asking if he could go no huddle he was signaling over in the sidelines that he just wanted to line up on the line sprint what she's doing here bob was going nohuddle second and five at the 13 yard line that is he throws from behind that fence was incomplete looking towards when Brian Young made contact with them as he releases it third down and five I think we're talking to Gary Gibbs the defensive coordinator of the Saints and he was talking about Brian Young as being his most consistent guy and you see how they're keeping him in the pocket the ends are getting up the field not letting them out there and then they get the push from the tackle that time being Brian Brian Young right in Tony Romo's face third and five a Marion Barber the back here on fair game flag will be against the SE snap for a time out his call time out was paused for a time out the snap let's go to Andrea well we've been singing the praises quite a bit of Sean Payton so before the game I talked to Mickey Loomis the Saints general manager I wanted to know how he even found out about he said his name was out there but he was telling me that the league the NFL keeps a halfanhour interview on file of prospective head coaching candidates so in early January he got DVDs of about 30 or 40 assistant coaches they're all asked the same questions when he would Lewis told me he was most impressed with Sean was not so much what he said but how he presented it Lewis also said that what was important to him is that he'd actually worked for Bill Parcells he wanted a guy who had a firm hand and he liked that in Sean Payton but I don't know what do you think guys this mentor relationship how long do you think that's gonna last you know Bill's got a pretty long memory for blow outs like this well I think Bill's going to be upset with his team if they don't win here I mean they you know they haven't been very sharp you know if they're going to do something to have to stop em in there the defense has to play a lot better map to pack a lot better third down and five and now Romo is going to take a timeout so they have a play call he looked at that defensive alignment didn't like what he saw and in a game in which he's already trailing by twenty five he has to burn a third quarter timeout next week we had West we go to San Diego the Chargers and a lot of people think they are the best team in the league right now we know LaDainian Tomlinson has had an unbelievable season and they will take on the Kansas City Chiefs she said a touchdown record today did Tomlinson 29 that eclipsed the mark set by Shaun Alexander last year and he's gonna break Paul hornings scoring record which has stood for decades maybe next week 1960 years women performer build and Dennis said he's two points away from time man they spread him out the walls of the floor fade into the end zone and blennies there and he's out of bounds couldn't come down in the end zone and you have a flag down back at the 17 yard line that signal is for a legal chop and I don't know what those other signals are well an illegal Chop lot number 65 and 62 the penalty is declined fourth down she had Gerard and go running Rivera the center and the right guard yeah it's gonna be right here and right here and again if if one blocker is engaged then the other guy can't hit him that's what it is now Rivera cuts 'm which is okay he can do that but then the log comes over the top which he can't do and so it's worth that I forget about a field goal this deficit fourth down and five on the 13 yard line their last touchdown came on a fourth down play can they do it again no Lin covered by Thomas and another penalty flag down at the 13 yard line I think that was against the Saints al I think they jumped which will be awfully close to a first down side number 68 so it's fourth and five result of a penalty well I was thinking the same thing lost who was thinking I was looking at wrightpatt and say you know well the five yards give him a first down yeah oh he's over the penalty maybe a measurement he's theirs although the penalty will leave them all approximately three inches short that's impossible to know it gave the International signal just before that is I have no idea of what it is I know one of its three entry sure and having it how do you know it's five yards and three inches okay I give up okay so it was it was it was fourth down and five yards and three inches if you need three inches that's a quarterback sneak one and I think Tony Romo will just keep this one now you're going to have a false start against Dallas or you're back to fourth and five and three inches all start sixtythree offense five yards the way this game is being called tonight if you had an offside here against the war liens he probably give Dallas a first down but you know you wonder wonder why Dallas was going through all that I would just think you just you know you need three inches you just you know snap the ball and just fall down and you know you can get your first down on a quarterback sneak and then go back to work from there with a new set of downs workin fathers final minute of the Fuhrer wahwah and has that one picked off in the end zone that's picked off by Jason Kraft on a pass intended for Whitley if Jason Kraft is a Nickelback the the Saints were in five defensive backs of course when they when they got that fourth and five then they then they went to nickel with the extra defensive back and you'll see craft is just going to come and undercut it you see he was fun instead of leaving Jason Witten you know on the top of him he just came right underneath in front of them the figures you know that he's in the end zone all the way through the end line so write him suit say he just comes in there with Whitman and just undercuts which is apply which is the thing that he would do though whose Macalester up to the 26yard line well there can be some booze in there with that deuce this yeah you're right it is a very mixed reception he will not have to run another play here first time a Cowboys opponent has at five touchdown passes in a game and Big D going back to the Cotton Bowl years 47 seasons so they'll change ends here it's the end of the third quarter the New Orleans Saints trying to go to nine and four with 42 points the Dallas Cowboys who've won four straight 17 and Sunday Night Football is back after these messages from your local NBC safety coach in the huddle because he's so fundamentally sound at the same time a guy who's a great competitor and a guy who wants to weigh in he's a winner as we come back to action in the fourth quarter wheezes pass is incomplete Bobby Carpenter the Dallas linebacker put the pressure on him and that makes it third down and four you know one group that's done an outstanding job tonight is this Saint offensive line talking to do some a Callister last night he said the biggest surprise to him was how well this offensive lines play and said they're just kind of a bunch of guys that they put together you know Jamal Brown was a right tackle they moved him into left tackle he got Jeff Fame from Cleveland Joey Evans the right guard is a rookie and and he said you know he didn't expect them to play as well as they have and you know all the surprises timeout know within this Borland Saints game there's that and here the biggest surprise to the Callister is the offensive line try not changed third down and 4 after the Saints took a timeout swing it out to Bush and that pass is incomplete so they took a timeout for on that play and one of the few things that having to work tonight for the Saints who had scored touchdowns on their last four possessions you know that's what you need in a quarterback like you know drew brees he's so efficient yeah I mean he hasn't he hasn't made any mistakes he hasn't forced anything and when he does for one awry like that all it is is fourth down in the front Steve Weatherford to kick Terrance Newman backpedaling past the 40 Terence Newman down the sideline and is finally forced out of bounds near midfield by the punter Weatherford and now there's another flag down on the sideline by the way we have solved the fiveyard and 3inch mystery I'll get to that in a second John oh you got the yep you got the fish curry slaw I'm gonna look at oh good keep preparing to Saturn illegal block from behind by the return team ten yards first down I'm just gonna have you wait to the other side of the commercial just a little bit of a tease but we have the mystery has been solved 42:17 New Orleans John there's the down box the chain is marked at what they say is exactly five yards and then Jerry Austin was able to say the three inches shy biggest the down box before that play was three inches behind the five yard mark as Lomo throws incomplete so live and learn they mark the chain at exactly five yards and then with the down box behind it that's how Austin was able to come up with they need three inches where did you come up with that's how Austin came up with it like because I don't know that Austin did because I look you know he gave that he gave that universal international look you know oh yeah like this one here like I don't I don't know we've seen that before he did that we've seen that look before now but we have discovered you know research that took us to you know the Nairobi and beyond that they mark the change at the 5yard line second attack look Romo going deep and Terrell Owens over his shoulder could not hold it in and he say induce of not now I mean that's the one they've been they've been trying to get terrell owens deep on this side again it's a nickel thing here and that's that's a pretty good deal to give a double move they give a double move and he's expecting the ball up in the outside he's looking over his outside shoulder and it comes over his inside shoulder but you know he got open he made a good move he had to catch that and that's that's on Terra third and ten twentyseven makes the catch and that's the first down as he drops down Fujita makes the tackle at the 40yard line sometimes you have to mix that in to you know they've been they've been trying to go deep to him the whole time you know get him out here I'm Fred Thomas and do all that sometimes when you you just play that stuff if you just crying out there you know that you can take it out you can take it in you very easy give it to barber on a draw and that carries nowhere second down to ten I think that Sean Payton has done such a good job against Bill Parcells tonight that if you're gonna get mad at someone you kind of have to have a priority list you know maybe you put yourself and your coaches first and then your players second and so on I don't I don't think you will put it on the opposing coach you madly second down and ten place a formal buys time and that is caught by Glenn up of the 49 yard line then it'll be a first down any one thing these these st. defensive backs were really hitting I don't know if they're if they're good defensive backs or not I mean they you know that's been the thing they've given up a lot of big plays this year but they're sure playing very crisply tonight Jay Bellamy put that last hit on talked about Fred Thomas earlier we've been having a great night and then he got beat on it Owens touchdown on the deflection apart from that you're right John they again when'll begins to stumble and that will cost him a sack will sniffing take advantage of that if Brian Young has really done a good job getting pressure up the middle because then the ends you know Charles Grant Will Smith they can keep containment C they can stay up field so that Romo can't get to the outside you see and then if you do that then to go along with that you need the pressure up the middle and Brian Young has given him that pressure up the middle big time tonight against going wrong second and 18 Romo airing it out Owens had trouble finding the ball double covered by Thomas and bollocks yeah and this is what the saints who have done all night to tony romo is they doing it they didn't want to let him outside so they had kept those ends up the field made him stay in the pocket you see they have pressure from the outside but even bigger than that is the interior pressure so they can't step up because if you just contain them on the outside that he can step off or step to the outside but if you contain them on the outside and get the pressure up the middle there's no place for him to go and kudos the Gary gives the defensive coordinator who was on the Dallas staff with Payton last year as the linebackers that's caught by Whitman at the 50yard line and Gary Gibbs knows Tony Romo very well because when he was a linebackers coach for the Cowboys you know Tony Romo would would run the scout team there's Gibbs right here Tony Romo would run the scout team so he was always hitting his defense ready against Tony Romo and he said Romo would do stuff and he would make plays need run and say hey they don't do that their quarterback doesn't do that he said so he knew what kind of a playmaker Tony Romo acquired a putt the nose the ball the reverse spin on it Michael Lewis makes a fair catch at the 16 11 11 to go in the fourth Bart corny my corn late a guy named Mike corn one of the great stars of the game with three touchdowns the troll died there is and then when he wasn't scoring John Carney was forest filled evening but I'm really impressed with Sean Payton I mean I've been impressed with him for a long time you know I thought he was you know a good young coach and I was never sure if he was ready to be a head coach but you know he he went down there he took a tough situation he had to change the environment he changed the environment the players have brought into it planning a big big part of that was second and seven breeze taking the play clock roll over them and begin to eat he's up the clock talked about the play you go back to that fourth and one early on on the reverse McCallister hands it off the Deborah Henderson and then Carney with three touch coming in then you have the onside kick with an eight for the touchdown on a third and five looking at Sean Payton keep in mind after the o3 season he came very close to winding up as though back so close he was thinking about going out and buying some silver and black clothing a sport coat right but they went with Norv Turner he came back here then last year Green Bay interviewed him after Mike Sherman was fired he had a formal interview in Green Bay New Orleans wanted him and as his interview with New Orleans he point and then the meantime Green Bay had called it back and told me didn't have that job and that's a false story right here and that's when he's a top five yards John Owens where'd he go out to do with Mickey Loomis and he's thinking you know am I in play in Green Bay what's gonna happen down here he gets the call he's not in play and he any longer in Green Bay they go to dinner and before he can even go to Buffalo he never shuffles off you know you know and that's and that's big I mean there's only 32 of these jobs and you know and he's a young coach and he one of them and he took it a difficult situation a lot of times your first coaching job easy the first camp the head coach has to be a difficult situation are going to be available Callister on first and 15 payton a little bit like Jon Gruden Eagles quarterback coach and the late 90s and he goes to the Giants is the quarterback coach offensive coordinator Jim fossil rain comes here under Parcells listed as the quarterback coach in the passing game coordinator because they really don't have in effect what you call an offensive coordinator who cement his associated would Bill Parcells a lot more than just three years I mean you know you hear stories about Sean played that Bill Parcells he think that you know that he's been a part of a of Bill Parcells forever it will really only together three years this is deuce up to the 29 yard line well it's now it's it's maybe the biggest surprise in the league talking about the the Saints certainly a great feelgood story considering everything that's happened to that devastated region now this team is really for real there are seven minutes away from being the number two seed in the NFC going to nine and four and thoroughly dismantling a Dallas Cowboy team that a lot of people thought was the best team in the end of seat right coming in they were the best team and then if they keep the Cowboys and you have to think that they're the best for one of the basket and that's McAllister on the third down and behind a Mike Carney block to the 34 yard line and that's that's your that's your deuce whoo combination and Mike Carney is played a heck of a game tonight I mean you know this this is what you expect of them this type of thing but that line has done a good job of block and it looks like looks like there's a little give up in the Cowboys on and this is this is where you want to get guys and they don't look like they're quite as anxious to play as the Saints are right now and that's a great position to be in but you have to give credit again to this Saint offensive line and they have taken these guys and they have beaten this defense down and with it's a 35yard game it's plush remember him Dean of five Andrea well between reduce and between Reggie it's interesting that it was only six years ago that McAlister was in Bush's position he was the highly touted firstround pick as the rookie and the veteran on the team was Ricky Williams yeah remember him well deuce told me Ricky didn't help him a lot and he said this was his team in fact he said that Ricky Williams belittled deuce as a player in front of the team he never forgot that to McAllister said that this was one reason that he wanted to welcome Reggie Bush as much as possible McAllister in 19 carries a hundred five yards as a Reggie Reggie pitch yourself here I don't think they're talk very big crowd numb feels like the Superdome I think that you know that he knows that there's plenty there for both of us that you know the running back position and the way this saying offense is it's it's not just going to be won back and I think Sean Payton kind of assured deuce mcallister that you know they they give gonna get to know the guy that's going to tell you that the court is going to get the ball alive in a different way you see anyway that second effort he picks up the first down he was stopped initially by where and then lunges forward well now he knows for sure that he's a big part of the offense you don't see this a lot inside watch watch deuce mcallister here on DeMarcus Ware he's just going to stiff arm him right there you don't see a lot of stiff arms on inside running I mean usually a stiff arm to stay safe for being out towards the sideline mention now he knows is as opposed to you know when the coach sits you down after they grab Reggie Bush and says you know I'm gonna make you a part of the islands yeah the hope it's true but there has to be a little skepticism and he's coming back off major knee surgery 21st carry of you know John the other thing we haven't talked about with the Saints tonight you have a 53 man roster in the league they have 34 guys who weren't there last year and when we did the Saints at the end of last season I've never seen a more up you know down fraud and you understood it there was no home as you take a look at what their stars have done tonight they were on they were on the road and there was some of the numbers for the you know the three I guess mega stars right now for the Saints Drew Brees is five TVs and you know deuce mcallister do this stuff such as the gun isn't bad either Reggie Bush inside the 10 and he'll step out at the four to the first down and go but I know Jimmy John you and I at that time they didn't even know they were going back to New Orleans and of course you know Jim Haslett paper a great quarterback and then good coaching because today the free agency it was many changed in part that you not only have to coach well we have to coach quickly and this is interesting now the student is saying to the mode and I'm not going to embarrass you well and Bill Parcells the sake that I don't I don't need that I'm getting this league too long and you don't have to feel sorry for me you know I will have my day and then maybe at the end as a kicker how about that onside kick yep I still think that this is a trend that we see more and more allergy you know the opponent in and maybe now it's well we started the night by saying how about dem cowboys is the new rallying cry once again in Dallas and we're going to end the night with that old refrain from New Orleans who dat gonna beat dem saints 4217 New Orleans on Tuesday night don't miss a new Friday Night Lights right here on NBC and there's a man who knows all about Friday Night Lights growing up in Austin Texas do breeze on a state championship in the stadium 10 years ago and he's having just a great night as one of those delicious nights if you're in New Orleans st. and like we were talking about the the Saints this year they come in here at 8:00 and 4:00 they're a feelgood story maybe there'll be a playoff team then they come out of this game but still a feelgood story as you say but maybe maybe they're the top team in the NFC right now well you look at the Chicago Bears who have the best record but you know it's it's been all defense to them they're tending to they play in st. Louis tomorrow night area division leaders and that's going to go to nine and four from New Orleans so at the moment they're going to be the number two seat Seattle losers today Dallas will drive to four Seattle would be three and they won't even kick a field goal here they're just going to kneel down and give Dallas the ball with 113 remaining in the fourth quarter sweetest bath he ever had coming up a rock star of the game highlights and interviews from Irving and now with New Orleans opting to take Annie Dallas will do the same and you know John was thinking about when Bill Parcells was talking about Tony Romo and put the anointing oil away I don't think you put the anointing oil just it kind of travels from city to city rex grossman had the anointing oil in September and then Tony Romo had the anointing oil as you look at cowboy owner Jerry Jones and I think the anointing oil just like it kind of moves around maybe Drew Brees has the anointing oil right now yeah but Drew Brees displayed I mean the other guys are young in any any quarterback who they're gonna have bumps in the road and you know tonight was a bump in the road for Tony Romo so breezy you know he's had those two good years I think people were always a little skeptical and now they realize what he is Sean Payton and you can see Bill Parcells saying good job and I would echo that I think I think Sean Payton did a heck of a I will let us guide it to the heckle job I would put about four exclamation points at the end of good job meanwhile breeze 26 out of 38 to 384 the Cowboys go to Atlanta next week Saints are home in the dome against the Washington Redskins Saints would 4217 our postgame show coming right up not only seeds fans in the building that who dad chin went up they are 9 and 4 with a 4217 wind but the night started out as if it was going to be a Dallas night because he had a 77 yard run by Julius Jones and just like that it was seven to nothing Cowboys but then came the onslaught and it began of all things with a Mike Carney one first touchdown of his career then before the second period was over the second touchdown of Carney's career on that pass they led 21 7 then it was 21 10 then Reggie Bush took this swing pass and went 61 yards for a touchdown to make it 28 to 10 it looked like they had it safely tucked away but then on a fourth bound play Thomas couldn't make the interception the deflection goes into the hands of Owens to make it 28 17 but then an onside kick a Carney touchdown his third of the night and a romp for Reggie Bush and the New Orleans Saints as they wanted 42 to 17 drew Brees having a tremendous year and tonight a tremendous night 26 out of 38 384 yards 5 touchdown passes for the native Texan Andrew will be with him when we come back and Richie Bush will be alongside as well in a moment when we come back to Irving Texas Saints ran up 536 yards tonight most ever allowed by a Bill Parcells coach team in a game that didn't go into overtime doing good measure to Drew Brees Reggie Bush and company drew and Reggie with Andrea Cramer you may say that you like the heavy lifting of being a running back but boy it's hard to beat you as an allpurpose threat tell me about the 61 yards screen path you know it's a great play something that we've been working on in practice and know someone saw him films and something we felt like we could exploit and we use it to our advantage you know drew did a great job of getting me the ball and you know coaches call great place what were you able to exploit in their defense you kept them on their heels all night this man right here you know this is the answer right here you know he's a great quarterback man and he just did a great job but putting the ball in places you know where they couldn't get to it give him our receivers a chance to make plays and you know rest is history thank you very much not true you must love Texas Stadium because last time you were here in 1996 you won the Texas state championship and put up 55 what is it that has enabled you to have five touchdowns against a very tough Dallas defense you know coming into each game you just don't know how it's gonna play out but I'm more happy than our fullback got three touchdowns today you know and I just happen to throw them two of them but you know I think there's just a great allaround team effort obviously this game in a lot to us for these NFC standings but not only that but coach Peyton coming back here and I know it meant a lot to him and we wanted to win it for him very aggressive play calling by Sean Payton maybe exemplified best by the fourth and one call what's going through your mind when he calls a reverse in short yardage like that well he told us on Wednesday that was gonna be the call in a critical situation on fourth and one so you know we hear that stuff all the time and we know that he's gonna live up to it he's gonna call it and obviously he expects us to execute it and we did and obviously was a big play in the game you mentioned Mike Carney before your fullback and allaround team effort but what about the performance of your defense in being able to corral Tony Romo I thought they did a phenomenal job you know they got us a turnover that resulted in a touchdown in that in that second quarter and and I just felt like we were really feeding off one another you know they get them three and out we get the ball drive down score touchdown I think momentum just stayed with us and that's what it's all about audience can hear the crowd yelling still for your team to what extent really are the Saints almost becoming America's team the other America steel I think this is amazing you know that you'd come to a really storied place like Dallas and play the Cowboys and win the way we did and yet our fans are still here yelling who debt and you know Saints and all those things so that's that's awesome we got great fans it obviously means a lot of them too thanks for your time thank you so there it is uptotheminute now Chicago plays tomorrow night and they can clinch your bye if they beat the Rams they're ten to two Saints would be the second seat at the moment Seattle would be third Dallas would be 4th at 8 &amp; 5 final score again 42 to 17 the New Orleans Saints defeat the Dallas Cowboys next week we go to San Diego and that means LaDainian Tomlinson Phillip Rivers and company against Larry Johnson and the Kansas City Chiefs football night in America begins at 7:00 Eastern and for Pacific time until allow my crews John Madden danger Kramer on fire NBC Sports Group save goodnight from Irving Texas
