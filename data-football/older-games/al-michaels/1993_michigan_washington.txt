============================================================

their offensive line features 67 340 pounds he anchors that line behind them Napoleon Hoffman will be the key man today number 8 Darius Turner number 31 starts at fullback Matt Jones said let the senior start and Mark Brunell the lefthander who two years ago was the MVP in the Huskies Rose Bowl triumph takes over and what to watch what he can do with this offense is bring the option at you there from the left hash mark first and ten Brunell to throw on first down complete damon defensively now for the Wolverines and they're going to line up a little differently from Hutchinson on the outside Agha Khan inside with Henderson and then also get a Russian breaking mica Thomas sent the Wolverines starting lineup here's the defensive backfield that backfield has been decimated all year by injuries second down the scripted play is a counter watch the fullback Darius Turner is to get this play here it comes number 31 explodes and Dick Vermeil the young man was so happy he could not wait to tell you about that play yesterday now he said and as you said Brent it's a counter all the way you'll see big Peter Peterson number 60 and the Lincoln Kennedy leading it through and you see Jerry's attorneys making a good gain right off the bat on a counter play Happy New Year mr. Vermeil and we welcome both Schembechler and bono bleeding wolf three haulers we got a lot of friends in Seattle I'm totally impartial in this game now drops it off and Kaufman slips on the reception they played the Michigan fights on down there on the field and I was standing next to Bowie couldn't help himself he started singing Oh here at the top of the game give everybody an idea of what happened to the defensive backfield at Michigan for coach Gary holder well he had two very fine corners that could play mantoman defense which allowed him to use those eight people inside and bring heavy defenses and blitz he lost both of them early in the season to injuries and so they've had to layoff being aggressive in there and have played more standard coverages now the Novak look for the Huskies now the first tackle with no backs in the backfield that really gives you the opportunity to spread the defense across the field focus your attention to the left side of the screen tied in cleaning out running back to laying underneath he was split out as a wide receiver no defender in that area again Brent no backs in the backfield spreading them all the way across the field first flag of the game Craig McKee Thomas was coming that time Greg McDonough is starting his first game a little bit anxious you'll see I'm here right to the bottom right hand corner of your screen number 41 see him jump across there again starting his first game and it being a Rose Bowl game Shantay people's number three strong safety blitz sack so now it is third down and defensively the Wolverines this year have been very good against third down giving up only 26% Brent they went for a period thereof 26 third down situations in a row and did not allow the offensive team to convert Brunell changes the play at the line the option this is coffee get the first down will stretched out in the hitter in that secondary hop came out about this is the numberone thing Gary Moeller the head coach of Michigan was concerned about the option the running of the quarterback tough the defense they'll come down the line of scrimmage option all the way pitch right there dumb blurt makes them flip it out there now you're flipping it to a guy that can fly doesn't get the block he needs outside doesn't get the first down john merdell punting for the Huskies Derrick Alexander deep for the Wolverine thankee de washington hop and wear gel gets one inside the 20 again for the 22nd time this year Verdell gets one inside the 20 yard line that'll bring a smile to a coach his face anytime now offensively for michigan jenkins only a freshman but the key here is steve effort the center he missed last year's Rose Bowl because of a knee injury but he's back a lot of talent here for the Wolverines especially Tyrone Wheatley Elvis Grbac is their quarterback they will operate without the huddle first in ten Wheatly smack to the line of scrimmage see they're trying to come off man the man blocking and in block zone you'll see up there to the top of your screen that Rob Doherty number 70 was laid off the ball and if you're laid off the ball against a quick defensive team like Washington you aren't gonna make an end Grbac pointing to his slot man as briefly plots in motion he'll look toward the left side incomplete third and long now defensively for the Huskies and remember a year ago they brought talented Steve mplet in here Andy Mason speed especially when it gets down and on the outside Jaime Fields with Dave Hoffman and James Clifford standing tough on the inside Walter Bailey's the best cover man Josh Moore is the only man over return next year in that secondary is Gary Moeller brings its Wolverines to the Rose Bowl for the second straight year the droplet first down and Wheatley to the 45 yard line with Pahoa hanging on that was a draw trap play good entrapped life by the offensive right guard Joe commotion he'll see him right here now following as he traps across they show us protection he's catching that was supposed Harry goes across there he kicks out there it is there's that lice laying up inside everybody else playing dead playing defense it gets the good game 23 yards for the talented sophomore Coco's Oh gets down in that pit ready to take on the defensive lineman again to midfield and parkour the free safety being forced to make too many stops if you had this Husky defense Bernie go get the pullback did a real good job that time of cutting the lineman right at the point of attack right on the line of scrimmage look at you cut him down and allowed him to find a way through there most of the time you don't want your fullback to cut a man in the hole you'd like to take him on I and let there running back run off that three carries for 32 yards already for that young man who just stepped in motion Grbac on this short drop fires coming to the 45 yard line and Josh Moore is defending bellmen Malvo and that beau as we watch this Michigan team we see that the attack has opened up more through the years the passing game more in vogue in college football well I think more one back and sometimes no throw the ball and I think coach Moeller's decided in this game that he's going to open this thing up and he started out that way deval just across the 45 yard line first and ten for the Wolverines their opening possession Ricky powers were scary waiting for the official signal getting up from the bottom of that file and he appears to have saved a moment for the rule David Hoffman the inside linebacker number 54 in the middle of your screen scraping off reading it all the way you'll see him flash now here he come boom he gets his head on the ball knocks it loose right there he gets help from the backside then he almost gets back in together second straight ahead and penalty flags come fly Miz DeMarco far appeared to be offside Brennan talking to Gary mower about his offensive game plan he said that they were going to put more emphasis on the quick passing game the 3step drop the fivestep drop they're gonna run draw traps and then run right at them last year they were sacked like five times in the first half that that type of thing by getting rid of the ball quickly and also running a lot of draws and traps mercury haze and the speedy young wide receiver checks in from Michigan and moving the ball to the 41 yard line draw play Wheatley Wheatley to the 37 yard line this will be third and short Hymie fields making the stop you'll see what I'm talking about the game plan unfolding in front of us draw I can watch the offensive linemen now as they shift set the show pass now freeze it right there freeze it right there you'll see the guard pulling across the trap as they allow penetration that's what's known as a draw trap Smith in motion her back pocket holds up he's got spit for the first time Smith is out of bounds inside the Washington 30yard line you see they catch him in a mantoman coverage and you notice number two Walter Smith went in motion one way then ricocheted and came back see and the coverage people could not stay up with him as he went one direction and wheel around and came back across the formation different start for Gary Moeller and the Wolverines in this game a year ago the Husky defense stormed all over Elvis Grbac early but not today first and ten again to the 25yard Don James's concern defensively was that the big Michigan offensive line could run right after their quickness he and they're a lighter quick moving defensive team and Don James that was his number one concern but to these big guys see they get knocked them off turn their shoulders and if you can't keep those shoulders squares you're gonna allow a crack up inside not a big crack but they got through xander in the middle and coming from behind was Steve the young nose man picked it up immediately and hustled back boy the guy that made the great play on that was DeMarco far the defensive blame and he's sitting inside here now yes it is a screen downfield has thrown behind the line of scrimmage so linemen can go but d'marco Farr reads it he moves down the line of scrimmage he he doesn't make the tackle but he makes him jump he can't get going again then the defense ricochets back there and makes the play good play by d'marco Farr Aires picked imarco far he might be the quickest defensive lineman I saw this year not a great big guy but very quick you know I talked to DeMarco far yesterday and I asked him about playing in on all Americans team effort he said he's played on a lot of bignose guards but he's never played on one my size that's quick as I am I'm going to give him some fits there was a penalty on this play and it apparently is going to go again listen Elvis Grbac in his final substitution infraction against the offense penalties decline third down was it Gary said was that law sit down that's what he wanted to know right away to see what down it was in this situation the ball is inside just inside the 25yard line and Michigan leads to get to the 18 for a first down against Don James defense Washington has been really to convert thirddown situations in all year only giving up 25% success against him on third down because of their kicking game you would think that Michigan would be thinking two downs to get a first down in this situation we'll have to see how that unfolds esker beck has time throws the Magee incomplete the gay being covered by the linebacker Hoffman that time and the ball was just a little high now the ball was thrown a little too high maybe the reason it was thrown too high DiMarco fara 75 quick ricochets back up inside he's right in front of me now and he forces that ball to go just a little bit high good job again by DeMarco farm well the Wolverines are going to attempt and alahzab a field goal here despite the injury that he's over if they go through with it the ball will be put down at the 32 yard line 41 yards and a morale boost from Michigan early they came in here very concerned about their kicking game and Peter Eliza Bach hits his career long way provided some spectacular pictures of the Rose Bowl parade here earlier today what a sight that is to watch the floats being assembled so now Louisville will kick it off then they drive Coffman deep into the endzone it'll come out on the 20yard line and let's go down below to Julie Moran Julie you're gonna notice the initials TS on all the Washington helmets and that's an honor of a very outstanding young man his name is Travis spring he was a strong safety at Washington and he died only weeks after attending the very final Washington spring practice and the team voted to dedicate the Rose Bowl and the possibility of three in a row to the memory of Travis spring Joey thank you very much that's warm story involving teammates of the late young man up at the University of Washington what they want to dedicate to his memory more than anything else is a third straight Rose Bowl triumph they trail it by a field goal and his pounded by McDonough's motion been good let me ask you about this young man Greg mccomus when we just saw his role here today well he started out as a fullback they moved into outside linebackers spring practice he was hurt early in the season missed the first four or five weeks when he came back they've moved him inside this is his first opportunity to play considerably inside well he flashed that he saw the gap that time and he just he just ran through second and ten there's the toss to comment he made the most of it Tyler gets him out about you know when you have that kind of speed you can make a little dip to the inside freeze the pursuit then get back outside but pretty good blocking see there's stepping around there they get it locked up in and they get the blocks out they've got a nice block out there by the fullback ccan you made that little JIT move inside and then bounced outside that slows down to pursue here's the bullion comic book can he fly he averaged 34 yards a touchdown run in high school Turner is the pull back for the Huskies the pressure what he does extremely well running for Washington first down 17 yards this was is exactly what Lloyd Carr the defensive coordinator from Michigan was concerned about this young man's ability to run see he gets up underneath he's flushed and there's some quarterbacks you're better off not flushing this guy is one of them see he still showed that he might throw the ball now he tucks it under and run Boyd does not like that aspect of defensing Washington's offense and Shonte people's goes to the Michigan sideline play fake by Brunel receivers are covered inside the 40yard line 19 yards to chasten Shelley you just cannot give a quarterback that much time on any down situation and this pattern took at least 5 or 6 seconds to develop he cross the field all the way across Shelly the young redshirt freshman catches the ball gets it down good job by Shelly but you can't give a quarterback that much time shelley completions ron 5ml who is perfect for 23 are actually Shelley is a true freshman not a redshirt freshman out of Vallejo to the 36 Lloyd Carr told me that they were gonna try to funnel everything back inside to where there's guys in there with a bad mood bad temper that conduct they didn't want to get spread out horse everything back inside Brunell is a real good athlete he can both run throw very excellent ball handler he fakes well see him like that puts the ball back on the hip that hides the ball from those linebackers and sometime the free safeties J berry comes out in the slot as Turner goes in motion and with no backs his first touchdown of the season but they'll spot it at the one a gain of 35 you'll see there's no back in the backfield Darius Turner went motion to the right side of your screen he spread the corner wide they hit the seam down inside that zone defense where the guy had the pre safety did not get over there breaking up touchdown or on the oneyard line and extra blocker as Jones leads the way Kaufmann following the two fullbacks into the middle and met Dyson swatted him that Dyson is a quality football player first team coaches all big ten this past year he's had some injury problems they've been moving him playing him in a different position today than he has all year part of that game plan to funnel people back inside Dyson on one side and Hutchison on the other side push him back inside look down here if you wanted also straight hand to copy over the top into the heart of that deep fence and this is some stand being waged by the heart of that goal line defense for Michigan the defensive line is doing a real good job at getting the offensive linemen down and allowing the linebackers to come back up over the top I thought he scored from up here maybe he did but it looked like it from but up here we have a pretty good seats either pushing back up inside there use the lead back the lead back carried the ball rather than being the blocker and the tailback carry the ball Eric bjornsen the wide receiver and a converted quarterback will hold for Travis Henson who was from Spokane Washington to leave no team is accomplished Moeller trying to win his first coach from Washington there in that last shot a levan he's coaching the road this is whateley pictures way Whately to the 32 one thing you don't want to do is give him a crack we were doing the game this year Brent when he broke it all away a long run for the touchdown 99 yards I think it's important now for Michigan to come back out and you know they went down they got that 3pointer print they lost a little of the edge now getting off Washington that seven pointer but now if they could come back to just fight him back get back in there knock them off the ball a little bit regain some of that momentum they just gave up this is Wheatley to the 33 for a couple of yards and a reminder that tonight the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans Miami Alabama 8:30 right after our Rose Bowl they'll square off for the national championship and hear Gary Moeller and the Wolverines are trying to win a Rose Bowl title for the big 10 which is having a tough tough season but guys beaten by Georgia earlier in the citrus here at Burbank on a short drop high couple of balls high Bo Schembechler anything you've noticed with his throwing delivery well you know when you throw that ball laterally that far that's a very difficult fast to throw and he's just a little bit off target plus if he threw it lower Kohi I think Tommie Smith would have picked it up he was coming right see right there he had to get up that's a dangerous pass to throw him to the flag you bet it is third down Michigan has to get to the 41 for a first down turbek sprinting to the left why inside gets it off complete to Hayes Hayes to the 44yard line and a first down Gary Moeller did a real good job right here just calling that play they've had problems and passed protection now they take it man bring them outside now if they want to rush up inside there the quarterback is not there he's outside the pocket he can buy some time now at the bottom of your screen you'll see mercury Hayes now watching work back to the ball see him right here any good job execution edie davis checks in is the tailback and Wheatley is out this is Davis behind Leggett and Davis finds a crack and battles his way across midfield to the Washington 49 yard line goodlooking run dick Davis haven't carried the ball that much this year he's just a redshirt freshman that's it you know and he's playing actually out of rotation because the one running back that they had there Jesse Johnson is not playing today and that would normally be his turn to carry the ball powers blocking for Grbac Grbac Goes Down eggs and ER and he overthrows him you know sometimes the quarterback who's got the good strength good arm he's got that long body good leverage and he's a little pumped up a little adrenaline flowing there a little bit more than anybody else you know if you're a linebacker you you can you can use that adrenaline to an advantage as a quarterback it can hurt your accuracy right here comes third and three for the Wolverines trailing Washington seven to three 2:14 to go opening quarter ours is the tailback in motion the fake delegates got the middle there is a penalty flag down there's a penalty flag now watch your back here Siri is coming out in motion you'll see the defensive wide he hits the scene with a tight in a playaction excellent call they're playing run all the way there it goes to tight end no safety in the hole Shane Falco everybody up inside no safety at all touchdown to do something well that's the one negative of the eightman front you know you don't have four guys back here on the only have three they were all right till he went in motion so Tony McGee with 33 catches on the season and five touchdowns for the Wolverines and Peter allows the veteran who has kicked his longest field goal of a season to start in the Michigan scoring on the day and give him a chance as they drove it deep in the end zone knowledge of what the defense was going to be in third a lot of times you have those in game play this is Barry from the three play is the thing here you'll see Nell if I can quickly explain you'll see they're running back coming out in motion they were Amanda man here he switched got out here the linebacker was supposed to pick him up he didn't do it Clifford didn't pick him up to here and run watch 53 right in the molina screen see he reads run he doesn't take him right here you see he's playing run no one covered him free other safety where the three deep was locked up on the other tied in touchdown a career long reception 49 yards and a first down handoff slides through that opening to the 29yard line every time we've seen him play Brent he is played when you average 6.5 yards of Gary through the year and 5.94 your career you're doing something pretty good we have an injured offensive lineman down appears to be Peterson miss of seven children born and brennick Scotland long ways from home right now bit of a new look here Ella Bache under pressure steps away from Stanley and he'll throw this one away you got away from the charge by Stanley there is a penalty flag down at the 30yard line now it's nice to have the opportunity yesterday to sit and talk the officials out here in the field Brent when they were getting their pictures taken no Lego receiver downfield coach Bo's he is intense as you were as a football coaching coach come on you gotta compliment him on the design of that last third and three play though that was wellconceived offensive football play Jim Becker you said when I was a young coach if you have go to your clinics and listen you speak as an older coach in the football now it'll be third down for the Huskies pushed out of bounds near the first down marker let's see where they spot this one on that far side mobility at the quarterback position when you have a quarterback that can make you miss back there Dyson had a member 91 had him back there didn't come under control watch 91 lefthand corner of your screen here that's Matt Dyson see now he should be a little more balanced right there see better athlete at that quarterback position you've got to always be aware that look at him go for that part and he did just get it just enough for a husky first down you know this guy's got all the tools as a quarterback Brent you know we were talking about his ability to throw his ability to run the option his ability to scramble he was a 3.9 that's 1b grade in high school in four years pretty smart young man the Arntzen the slot receiver to the right Brunell on first down his receiver slip Jones the fullback slipped at the 37 yard line that was a nice story that Matt Jones number 22 on your screen was telling us yesterday remember Brent he actually is the starter but he asked the coaches if Darius Turner number 31 could take his place because he's a senior and they're very close friends and he thought the senior should start there's Darius Turner who did start the football game and is a good football player but it was the starter Matt Jones that asked the coaches to put him in there the Arntzen motion the draw at Kauffman and Kauffman welldefended by Tony Henderson Tony Henderson can do that plan inside he came into the ball game with five tackles for loss he's a quick guy he's also very strong at the point of attack also an outstanding student I think they own those rundowns they oughta get back into that that option because I know that Michigan is really concerned about it Coffman 8 carries 11 yards Michigan's defense doing an excellent job against the talented tailback Bernal throwing under pressure and there was no receivers there was no receiver there he has to call it there was nobody as you said you see they're loading up game plan to put pressure on here to see the defensive front right here they're spread across six guys right they run the stunt freeze it right there see these two people cross charge they came like this they didn't pick it up properly see right there you see 97 Hudson getting in there he should have been picked up properly in there he wasn't that's why he was so clean inside there here now you know good field position after this punt even if you don't get a punt return that one moves the ball back inside the 20 the down marker flips to 4th and the Huskies will use Verdell with Alexander set to give the Wolverines what they hope will be excellent field position he hangs it high at the 49 and a penalty flag is down yeah they interfere with his right to catch a football they didn't give him that few feet that they're supposed to give him right there they hooked his arm the flag was thrown right away good officiating you'll see it right there Sam right there he bumped right in me Alexander did not have a chance you've gotta get him room to catch he got a fair catch you must give him room to feel that ball there's one more look at that same play dirt down standard good concentration reaching to take the ball football and that's 22 Matt Jones now they might say that Matt Jones was blocked into him let's see what they rule the Michigan player was running Jones in to the receiver now an official might miss that ok that would be easy to do if you're looking at the purple jersey but it was fairly clear on that reef watch it that the white jersey had sealed up to ward alexander he had no place to turns against the kicking team 15 your screen now you see right here in the righthand corner now here it is down here happening this is a huge break for Michigan that's a good call that's a good call see there's 30 yards in penalties 15 on the guy downfield and now 15 here disagree I don't think Jones had any place to go on the play to tell you the truth I thought it was one of those accidental things you still have to give him and people actually locked into him I think Alexander's judgment was atrocious I think Alexander should have got out of the way however I'm not sure that Smith was trying to block it freeze it right there he should have pushed Smith out of the way say he's not trying to block her anybody he's just trying to not clip him from behind yeah here he is but his left arm you know we could go on and on left arm down at his side indicates to me that he's trying to get out of there as best he can regardless you know regardless there was contact made it's certainly impacted they but the interesting thing that happens on it is that after the penalty Michigan gets a first down they get the ball it's a huge turnaround in this Rose Bowl the ball is now inside the 40 and it's go back quarter of the Rose Bowl comes to an end Michigan leading Washington by three ten to seven in seven over Washington Huskies trying to win for the third straight time that would be at first Michigan has other ideas Smith in motion Wheatly Tommy Smith came up from his Rover position to take him on first well they play him as you said a rover they play him as a true strong saftey they play him as a safety safety now they walk him up and play him as a defensive end at that position on the line of scrimmage you'll see him at the top of your screen right now lefthand corner of your screen number 22 versus reverse angles now he comes right down on the line of scrimmage that prevents the cutback Smith pressing again at the line and it backs on her bank it's time you know Elvis got back there set up and then moved himself he had no reason to flush he's been knocked down a few times already he should have sent right up there pause and let the ball go there was no reason for him to flush there's no one around him see he had her set reset and throw and that was just enough to not get it there accurately enough for the completion when you have time you must take the time to set up properly and throw the ball well a coach motor sure not playing it close to the vest lerton tan he's going through a vaguely and a penalty flag with the clock running down so they're back her staples and up five yards and hope that he did not punt one into the end zone for a touchback which makes a little bit easier for him to lay it inside that 10 yard line Kaufmann standing back at the Husky 11 Thank You mo 50 yards let it go he hit one like that all year now Happy New Year yo man Pramila stat right here is time of possession Michigan less time in more points more good place now Brunel hands to Jones and Hutchison takes him on at the 23 yard line and down we go to Julie Moran Julie well Brent I'm here with a former husky and a number one draft choice for the 49ers Dana Hall and Dana you were here won the Rose Bowl last year and now you had a shot at the Super Bowl I'd say it's been a pretty good year for you yeah so far so good you know last year was a very exciting experience for me win the national championship you know in the Rose Bowl and now the have the opportunity to play in the playoffs and make them so Super Bowl is very exciting but you had a pretty tough assignment covering Desmond Howard last year it was tough only came out a game with one catch and I think a lot to do with he didn't respect me at all and it's tough right now is they're having a tough time out there but the golfers can get rolling I think we can get this one good luck in the playoffs and back up to you Brent yeah thank you very much Julie that is certainly a badge of distinction for that defensive backfield of a year ago they came in determined to shut down Desmond Howard if you look at the game tapes the coaching angle they were yelling and pointing and they dogged him all over the field in that in that Rose Bowl triumph of a year ago but this is a more versatile Michigan attack this year more weapons Washington will have to play at its best now to come from behind again burnell's option this is Jerry being with the way the Wolverine defense is hitting Morrison has been in on a couple of plays Maloney is out there and Dyson Dyson did an awfully nice job that time because he went down the line of scrimmage forced the quarterback to pitch and then broke and sprinted down the line of scrimmage and women's it was in on the tackle nice job of playing defensive end a year ago Michigan hunted ten times this year it is Verdell and the Huskies who are being forced to repeatedly punt in this game this is his third already that's a return type punt real low if he can get to it can't get to it I think the coaches told Alexander to stay away from it when you have good field position he was headed for the locker room folks that's a 38 yarder 44yard line motion Becca your observations about the two quarterbacks are Elvis Grbac and Mark Brunell well I think in the case of Washington Brunel is a tremendous threat outside the pocket the more he scrambles the more it's going to hurt Michigan in the case of grbac he is not a he's got to stay in there if he's going to throw the ball well here is second down this could be a throwing situation for the Wolverines as grbac Chuck's quickly with Wheatley Leggett goes out Novack's short drop 1 sweetly almost intercepted Chuck's more handed in his hands I think he was surprised he was you know the Brett you said short drop which was true he's set short but if you said sure you should unload the ball quickly because if you don't now watch right here he'll go back and set short if you don't get ball right on the ball quickly the rush gets to you you can't throw it accurately sometimes you can't see either third and seven Tony McGee dandy that was a tight end Wheatly iliza back draw trap here it is again now skiing the big offensive lineman right here will pull and trap and cross now watches because he pulls across Russia it was the other way around 70 to see him right there he turns up they rush so hard he beat him at the buck good blocks down field great speed state 100 feet meter champion I want you to tell our audience the conversation you had this year with Tyrone Wheatley well the backfield coach asked me to talk to him and I clearly asked him whether he wanted to be a track man playing football for a football player running track and he told me he wanted to be a football player I said well then you have to start to practice like one and play like one because he hadn't done it up until then he look like a football player on that run didn't he folks now here's another football player needs to respond out to the 25 and a reminder that we've got more football coming your way tomorrow the NFL playoffs will begin right here on ABC at noon doubleheader action in game a 1 Frank Gifford Al Michaels Dan Dierdorf they'll have Washington and Minnesota and meanwhile dick you and I'll pack up after the Rose Bowl go down to San Diego it'll be the Chargers a wonderful story against the Kansas City Chiefs a doubleheader coming your way tomorrow at ABC and a blimp but your blimp will just come right down the coast with us we look forward to those pictures in San Diego now first and Ted Turner and it is a swarming Michigan defense up by 10 led by Greg McDonough's doing the job real good down line play there to brent by Buster Stanley number 60 he held his point right there on that counter play they tried to double him he held his point then good flow good pursuit from the linebackers good job by Buster Stanley yes we have an official timeout right now Washington is being held to less than three yards a rush they have gained 47 yards in 16 carries against this Michigan defense well Michigan's been tough against the run all year only giving up 89 yards of Paul game boy hey that's darn good run defense they're almost impossible to get outside of with the basic normal type play the I toss the sweep it stuff we have got an official injured down here on the sidelines that's the umpire John Bradley and watch the bottom lefthand side of the screen he is in that pit area and an umpire you can see he just got rushed there at the side up high that was Corwin brown number 20 accidentally coming alongside brushing that side of the face Brunel on the roll burnell's got it into Turner's hands and Turner battles his way to the 31 yard line and met Dyson on the tackle the umpire is going to leave this game which means that the crew will adjust on the field right now so one of the linesman will come in and operate for the time being as the umpire now the umpire you can see he moves right in behind the linebackers they're on the inside that's the linesman who for the time being will be the umpire now on third down short drop Brunel fires and a diving reception by Joe Crowley and he's injured on the catch he did an excellent job of diving out there to get that one I mean he sacrificed his body and these are these are tough tough tough throws good throw like I'm watching briefs right here at the bottom right hand corner screen look and go out there and make that catch heck of a job good concentration all the way giving the Huskies a first down at the 36 yard line trying to get something happening here before the intermission it's showy : ground the free safety number 22 see on your screen here was right where he ought to be you'll see him come in he just misjudges it look at him he's looking at the ball he goes for tseebo for at its highest point right there but he didn't get there quite quick enough excellent job by Shelley Travis Henson I want you to watch down by the goal line as we see the replay did he have possession we'll come back and take a look Martin Rick he's back at the end zone we had to run in and quickly say take a knee don't try to come out so credit young Wheatley with telling Hayes to get down now let's take a look and did he get across the plane of the goal deck now you'll see watch the lines right freeze it right there you can see the line is here now the ball is out right here the judgment has to be made by the line judges side judges they're at whether he had the ball and broke the plane it's really questionable it could be Michigan's ball going the other way the law pounced on the ball and if he didn't break the plane it should have been a touch back here now back off that short truck fires to his tight end who was founded in the 25yard line McGee hit by fields two flankers and I think they're going check with me to what they think is the weakness of the defense we have a man down that is Walter Bailey he is their best cover man you can just listen to this time 245 pounds hitting Walter Bailey at 185 pounds he breaks a couple of tackles before they finally swarm him down at the 26 you know he does show some shake and break not like a track man would be playing football more like a football man that can run as fast as track people you see him shake and make him miss there you know Schembechler tell you you were a football player you would be a truck man either much of a choice now you watch 91 to the left side he was being Hoffman come down the line of scrimmage you'll see him appear from the right side of your screen no watching he shakes he makes him miss he comes back here comes Hoffman he makes him miss Wheatley's emotion we're back go back with plenty of time and a diving reception by Alexander at the 32yard line a tremendous job by Alexander covered by the coverage pattern doesn't develop right away he keeps working back to the quarterback until the ball gets here excellent job by Alexander giving Moeller and the Wolverines a fresh set of downs you'll see what I mean right here is rolling out he's rolling out so you know now watch through the left side of your screen it's seen working back to the quarterback you can read his numbers right there excellent job good coaching one of the big play men from Michigan this year defensively the Huskies get ready is wheatley comes in motion and grbac rolls to the right and he's going to put it up deep for Alexander it'll be second in ten more covering in there really going after that was a double move they went out push the defender up made a little out move then starts down going deep you'll see the ball just throw it over the outside shoulder let's see if he gets the foot down he gets it down on the line good call by the officials there's Josh Moore just a sophomore Torrance California most improved defensive back in the spring demonstrating why he won that award by being a good coverage position on that play Wheatly to the 33yard line clifford cleaning up ha caught up fast from his safety position clifford also a minor league baseball player with seattle and not quite sure what he wants to do he'll get a look by the NFL he's a very solid blocker I should say blocks very well to make the tackle that is the key point that the Washington coaches have always made about Clifford he underwent major knee surgery a couple of years ago and he's an outstanding inside linebacker you can see the protective brace that he wears on that right knee timeout as the clock was running down instead of a penalty Grbac effectively took the time out and he'll come over to the wolverine sideline michigan by a field goal chickens may have moved and let's go down for Washington and for Walter Bailey as you can see they're taking his left shoulder right now he has a slight separation in that left shoulder and at this point they're saying he's possible for the second half but they're giving us no definite word on that Julie thank you and dick that would be a blow to that defensive backfield you drawing right away because he is their best coverage guy you'd see in that scheme where they play an eightman front two quarters in one safety well there's a lot of man man man to man coverage and you need quality people to play that defense and research now shoulders quite a burden the Wolverines will attempt to exploit him before the afternoon is over Alexander in motion toward that side Rebecca's looking in that direction Verbeck fires underneath the Smith and he really threaded the needle on that toss fields and Hoffman were there with coverage it is short of the first down and Michigan will punt see he wanted to go to the tight end in motion wide receiver and get the first down good coverage he couldn't get there so he comes to his third receiver Stanley who ran a crossing pattern but good defense by Hoffman prevented the first down lousy punt and Coffman will let it roll Huskies get the ball at the 29 yard line after that 33 yard effort so when the young man should drop the short one inside the 10 he booms it out of the Rose Bowl and when you need that strong like this is no wonder you guys get prematurely gray as coaches so what else is new they'll do it to you every time John Bradley has received a couple of stitches down below and checks back into the game this crew is from the Western Athletic Conference they're tough guys they've been up to Laramie and Fort Collins they know how to handle things town here of course beau he was always an official's guy first and ten now for the Huskies down by a field goal here's the fullback Turner for the 31 yard line Michigan's defense is doing an outstanding job against the run here in this half against the run all year but I came in thinking well maybe because you know there haven't been many great running teams in the big team this year that would distort their defensive stats but hey they are sound on defense up against that run especially 17 carries 49 yards big Lincoln Kennedy over there on the left side had his hands full with stalee Brunel Sprint's out to the right he's taken down at the 31 yard line that was Steve Morrison number 36 he learned from Erik Anderson and he is an outstanding inside linebacker see the thing he did that time Brenda's he came to balance meaning he kept his feet apart he bend his knees and he went in and made the proper tackle at units when you do that it's tough too for that offensive player to make you miss now third in law one of the things about Morrison with those quick feet he can also drop back into past coverage better than an awful lot of inside linebackers in college football for now under pressure steps away from where great block to give him more time Mark Brunell that Damon berry Damon berry did an excellent job running down the field looking back inside he sees the ball going to be outside and he goes ahead and turns all the way around Damon berry did a real nice job now what's the left side of your screen scramble it came the Blitz oh good good mobility gets outside the pocket you see he's looking back inside now watch what he does is the ball come down he makes an excess Willie Mays playing centerfield there Brent excellent job where that ball almost popped out there too as bad as they have been running that's how good they've been passing Hannah mel has used eight receivers here in the first half but now looking for daylight to the 13 yard line it almost get the feeling if you're a husky fan that you'd be better off throwing on first down wouldn't you you know in Michigan is doing a good job of mixing up what they their normal basic defense that they play mostly year and then their game plan defense that they're playing in this ball game that they haven't been playing and and it really throws you off when you come in prepared for something and detail your preparation and all of a sudden they're playing something different option Washington ball but Morrison made a big play against Brunel excellent job I'm Morris and now here he is just follow him as the linebacker now good job is to down the line option see if what he stays in position see he doesn't want to overrun it keeping his shoulder square see he's his lane he attacks makes a play well done now third and a long for the Huskies they need to get inside the 5yard line so he must have 14 yards or it'll be Brunell straight back the Huskies at the back ten four point lead over Michigan and the Big Ten touchdown reception here it is in the Rose Bowl hutchinson get some pressure on it but you'll see him down the bottom in the morning the street right in right there throw right where you have to Thornton right outside away from the inside defense excellent job take another look at that you'll post your attention to the right side of your screen right over here you'll see it's mantoman coverage you're going to blitz it the safety right here and I'll freeze it right there see my own he's working over to pick him up he's already inside so he sticks him and hitches to the corner see no I didn't get much of a stick but enough seeing the ball is thrown probably grabs him by the jersey excellent job Safety's not used to being in mantoman coverage they're happy in Aberdeen Washington today three minutes and 14 seconds left in the first half you know Bo that's a case of a safety trying to disguise his coverage just a little too long and not getting them in position well he let the end get outside of them yeah Hayes will down it again while coming up at halftime here's Wheatley Wheatley for a first down and 20 yards on the run flying play this time by ffensive LY me you'll see they're pulling from the right side of your screen they get the kick off they get the lead up through you see big number 70 they're working his way up through there that's Rob Doherty that gives that guy room you give him room boy you have problems already a hundred and twenty yards rushing on ten carries for Wheatley Mason was coming Alexander can't get the handle but credit the pass rush that time yeah at that bliss comin ol Andy Mason number 13 coming he had pressure all away they were trying to run that wide receiver screen st. he could nurse feels getting it off getting it to him and you want to get those people upfield on those kind of places if you can but you don't want to get the quarterback he'll either powers checks in along with Davis giving Michigan a couple of tailbacks in this formation and it's Davis from that fullback look and it did not fool Hoffman Hoffman was ready and he took him down at the 42 yard line you know that's the same type of play the draw trap that they'd broken twice 1 for the long run this time mr. Hoffman is key in it all the way now watch the trap blocking see the offensive lineman Big Joe Pass they come across trap he's frozen on right now there he is he's waiting for him to get there good job by Hoffman but you're not going to get it done game is the quarterback when you've got Todd Collins over there is your backup and and go back here on a four point shootout third down the pocket holds up Grbac goes to tuber the coverage and Michigan dearly wants to test Walter Bailey's replacement you know I really think they call that anticipating mantoman coverage they went zone coverage tough to run a deep corner against a three deep tone I'm surprised that they did lay off man for the underneath that deep corner say not much of a chance to get his up corner pattern on a 3d tone I was shamed park boy you caught the 2 and that was 21 coming to help out from that zone now it is Stapleton and Kaufman will let it roll dead at the 18 yard line the art monitor himself there bring Kaufman's mad at himself constructed threw his head back there he should have run up there and fielded that ball 11 stepping to the right side and again nothing doing with that running Mina Agha Khan who was born in Baghdad makes the stop for the Wolverines he did a real good job of taking on the offense he tackled Tommy Gallagher and just knocking him back almost right there and just waiting for the ball carrier to get there and make the play himself didn't need much help nice job see there's big Lincoln Kennedy drama major you'll take the spring off to go to the NFL combines then he'll come back and get his degree trying to open the whole that time for his tail back and Buster Stanley stepped in there defensively and time out is called big Lincoln at 325 pounds he says he's working to keeping his weight down but look at this agility look at this agility good footwork good hand placement he can't block all 11 battling see in Washington comes back with the same kind of play they run the quick trap there with Andrew Peterson trapping across the ball for a moment like the ball went down yet he might have lost it and an offensive lineman was forced to pounce on this ball let's take a look at this real quick trap you see him pull right there he gets a kick out block there it is he gets hit the point now he Retton yeah he does fumble that gate comes out Harrison picks it up number 71 just in case they got a look and Verdell gets a Washington bounce and Alexander let it roll quietly to the 20yard line was 48 seconds to go at a 53yard punt an experienced punt returner like Derrick Alexander should have picked that ball up he wasn't threatened probably cost him at least 12 yards right there 47 seconds Michigan doesn't have any timeouts 47 seconds to go with Grbac Alexander Smith tumour and Wheatley they're all on the field now for Michigan here at the end of the first half move by the right tackle cost the Wolverines five yards coach mower and talking to him about his concerns What did he say my concern is Brunel and the option the option has been defense turned about you finding out his starting lineup I think he learned that from the coach pat was standing right here after you know he wasn't real easy to find out the lineup for him either to McGee at the 24 yard line with Hoffman all over the tight end two big plays for the Wolverines here in this half and it was McGee who caught a touchdown pass from Kerr back in Wheatley who exploded around midfield and Ty material again and nowhere to rumble against the Washington defense like lustick hitting him with 23 seconds to go there's a hi Shelley Shelley to the 44 yard line final 13 seconds here of the first half number 10 Todd Collins you saw on your screen there Brent he was the quarterback today we did the Michigan game this year against Houston and he played awfully well good future at the University of Michigan Perry is did a great job in filling in for the two games at Greer bhakta number 65 seven touchdowns and and only three interceptions that's a good touchdown to interception ratio Brunell to Shelly 40 yard line see they don't have any timeouts you just got to get up there that I don't think they just want me to change the clocks top left on that clock I think you'd just snap and down it oh they got to go with four seconds you got to go with the clock to having stopped here on the first down yeah might as well throw it into the end zone see he wants to get a good huddle call Brent and get a good play and take one last shot and good definition by everybody he's only got the one play either way and he wanted to get good definition nowhere and the first half comes to an end and we'll return with more for this message and a word from our ABC station carries permission Michigan trails it by four points is back deep they've been kicking away from Wheatley they have been putting it in his hands with a great play for the kick it's a back up inside linebacker that's played well when he had the opportunity to play behind James Clifford that was an excellent play good speed it got in there knifed his way through nice job of covering a kickoff nice way to start the second half set the temple for the defense but with a special teams play kakuzu Doherty Everett scheme Jenkins the starting offensive line on the field for the Wolverines Leggett and Wheatley other running backs tumor and Alexander the whiteout Wheatly with a crease Wheatly to the 35 and he did it pretty fast too of USC against Ohio State at 1980 rushed for 247 this run gives Wheatley 208 yards on the day Michigan regains the lead talk about people with speed here he is he's done this before he's been an excellent kickoff returner through his career this kickoff lady the ball was up in the air and hung up there now he sees the minute he gets a kick up off to the right of your screen see here's that little shake and break inside safety over in it fortunately they have speed and the safety position come from the right and puts him down otherwise it's a six pointer Washington will start at the Wolverine 45 yard line first down they swing at Matt Jones the fullback Dyson takes the amount of bounds at the 39yard I'm going to take a look at that touchdown play please don't always go where they're supposed to go it was supposed to go over here it didn't go there big Doherty is pulling to trap here it didn't go there DiMarco far slants bound inside go ahead and run it slants down inside he sees the whole back side right here and he just keeps going straight ahead he says heck it's nicer right here now you can see how valuable speed is he's in between two safeties they can't collapse outside in on too much speed Tyrone Wheatley three track events while in high school in the state of Michigan he is an extremely talented athlete who checked in a little bit heavier this year and Mark it down the Tyrone Wheatley going into next season will be one of the most celebrated backs in college football and we did the third game of the season he wasn't a starter third and short Turner for the Husky first down people's couldn't hold on and he blasts his way to the 31yard I've really got his pads down into the tackler of that time and really fought his own way for that first down Bret individual effort by Darius Turner well the contest between Wheatley and Kaufman has been no contest so far has it Kaufman looked good on that 47 yard kickoff return but Wheatley headed for a possible Rose Bowl rushing record he already has the longest run now for his score on first down Bernal driving the Huskies what a wonderful save by Brunel well I'll tell you this this guy is a competitor a bright competitor good concentration downfield he wants to throw look at those eyes probably a dummy audible in this situation he gets back he's reading right now he's looking for the second receiver third receiver now he's back as a ball carry keeps the ball in the left hand in the position that he can go ahead and throw now he tucks it under and becomes a running back steps his way to the 17 yard line and 28 of more touchdowns rest 70% that's a very good percentage good coaching football inside they toss Brunell off a beautiful fake hits Brunner see he faked the toss like you said grant and that pulled the strong saftey who has supports contained position makes the top safety up in there see face itas good extension right there that pulls the safety up playing run he throws this tight end pattern in where that strong safety would normally defend good execution second concentrate on that tight end he should be leading them on no kind of Defense that time showed that they can come off the ball not as big as Michigan offensive line see they come off the ball here and all mantoman blocking there good bunny picks up the linebackers awfully good job by Jim Neville in the middle of your screen the center and they get up behind him there again making a stop on a good football team as a true there's any reason for Michigan to change what they give it to number six number four sprint champions Jamie feels Jaime feels right here he was a sprint champion in the hundred meters yeah ten six here he is playing linebacker you throw the ball out there it doesn't take him long to get to the point of attack Wham there he is him or to the sideline and kneel down replaces him go back battling free with a flag down on the far side you know the headset you see the coach is talking there it's really important to have a guy in the press box doesn't narrate the game to you give you the facts give you the figures but don't keep talking to everyone so why do you put a guy on there and it's he's like I am talking all the time you know you can't have that kind of guy talking to you in the headset drive you crazy be precise be concise give me what I want to hear and shut up the penalty boosts the ball back inside the 10yard line I'll shut up you talk there is that offensive line and effort it's a wonderful story muskies will be stomping in come back into the end zone she Washington went to a cure zone defense that time Michigan rolling out trying to buy some time they worked down there had a shot at it another penalty flag thrown back by the goal line who dropped the hanky holy decline and Stapleton will punt out of the Michigan endzone with Shelly the freshman wide receiver standing across midfield in Washington territory looking for a return and he may have it at the 45 40 down at the 35 yard line 10yard return for Shelley playing on a very short field here Brett you know he had a return therefore he stayed up inside he had a kick out block then he jumped outside the kick up experience running punt returns best thing you can do is keep going to feel with it from where they are in field position with the one play that Eric bjornsen wants to run that flanker reverse and throw the pass this would be an ideal spot on the field Kralik is in the game and bouncing goes outside to the right run right straight ahead with the draw play and Richard Thomas getting his first carry in the game you know bjornsen told us about that play you were talking about coach and he said you know we've been working on it for eight games we haven't called it yet if he doesn't call her we're gonna call it ourselves won't get the chance right now because he leaving the game and he was swinging it he's a converted quarterback he volunteered to play receiver and they'll be back at the quarterback position next fall so it's Brunel with that you can sense Brunel's confidence growing in the pocket the way he is pulling out and quickly setting up and you know because he's he has the ability to do both set up in the pocket and throw accurately set up and scramble out if he has to roll out if he has to he's not limited in regard to athletic skills he's 14 of 18 for 246 yards throwing the ball against the Wolverines today across the 30 put the ball what about the 27 44 yard field goal attempt Eric Nam's Hansen he's 3 for 4 and that bitch is coming in you know his brother is the kicker at Detroit had a great year kicking 21 of 26 field goals Brent you really liked him when he was in college I thought he was a Heisman Trophy won the Orson is the holder here comes the 44 yard attempt you know bread I didn't think he was going to make that because heat the kicker Hansen broke his rhythm he started most of time when that happens you don't get it done low snap see everything was often guard to regard to rhythm but he still kicked it accurately take another look at that see the ball down low holder does a good job of getting it back up there if the origin does and he puts it weren't supposed to go between the go home 31 and 24 55 points on the board in this Rose Bowl and still a lot of time to go they put it in Hayes hands this time Hayes blast for the 24 yard line let's look at the Michigan quarterback numbers right now 20 to having a pretty good day last year in the game he was 13 and 26 powers goes back to the left and makes it to the 29 yard line the Ricky Powers was a starter there and he injured his ankle and this is the first game that he's a hundred percent healthy you know I visited with him about it yesterday and he you know he gets hurt Whiteley takes it over and he can't get his job back but he said if I get my opportunity today I'm there chillin I'm a good tailback with Davis checking in he gets the call Davis to the 31yard line here's what I don't agree with dopant you know it's easy to secondguess but when you've got a horse that's running and really running hard keep him in there and getting the football I'm gonna give Moeller one little pass on Wheatley because when they set up to return that kickoff he was not on the field this last five tumor was out there yeah we'll get a check that's enough rest but you know you get it running back this really hot just like a quarterback that's hot just give him the ball he made he's banged up that's what I was wondering however he's got the helmet on there on the sideline powers Grbac Verbeck has time throws to Alexander you know what they're doing right there they running one man pattern impossible to get any pressure on the quarterback one man pattern working back right here you'll see that everybody else stays in right here anybody else going out for the path they're just gonna all but we defy you to get to our quarterback now watching work back into that zone Mason and fields are lined up defensively on the same side for the Huskies and they were ready for Davis and Davis got to the 44 are you Washington glans who may have joined us at halftime or a little bit later Walter Bailey injured his shoulder in the first half and it's unlikely that he will return in this game Reggie research number five is the cornerback he is on the wide side of the field there he is and he has held up quite well thank you underneath the Smith and it was restoring first with coal I'm coming over to clean up on the tackle real good job by Reese are releasing the slant pattern when the inside soon as he saw it thrown he released back up inside and makes the tackle good job by research now gir back in his last third down in this series McGee scored a big touchdown for Michigan earlier and you would have to think that the Wolverines want to get there tight end back involved in this offense as Wheatley returns Wheatley and tumor check in from the sidelines so McGee will line up and Wheatley no surprise and he got the first down off a second effort he has gained better than 200 yards and yet this one may be the most important of the game he may be a little bit short this time then just go ahead and draw on trap with a Ganci netted then he killed I think that's Buckner and came down inside there and made an contact look at the effort look and he's not a track man play a football he's a football player here it is again I'll see him fight him DeMarco Bart is 75 has him he runs out of that he's still not down he works down he's a little bit shows knee was down and they've spotted the ball oh it is just short and the Wolverines I think it's a Weasley is staying on the field Wheatley is the up back in this formation and Butler sees him defensively now both Butler and Hoffman point out that Wheatley is on the field and so as a result the Wolverines will punt and Shelley makes the fair catch at the 17yard line that was a good decision to go ahead day you know the fans want him to go for it but you're only one play out of the ballgame of 3124 goahead run to play defense Huffman squeezes through to the 23 yard line see they're given the opportunity the offensive line to put some weight forward and just come off the ball and nail nail people in their zone a blocking scheme like that time they just came off and he ran back behind the nose garden big Lincoln Kennedy number 75 leads the offensive line is the tackle looks like the moon coming over the mountain line up on the right side and Brunel family in pursuit and he fires complete and now it's being waved off now the other official comes over and a penalty flag came flying also did he Co out of bouncing and come back in Dec I think he did here look to the lefthand side of your screen he's out of bounds right there you can go out of bounds and come back into college if you're knocked out of bounds but you can't do it if you're not knocked out of bounds dun gets it explained to him so a very costly penalty in this situation they're eaten up to clock time here's take a little while against Vernell slips regains his balance Tyson's 9 he lost his balance and he just could not avoid the bulrush see that's the one negative to that peddled techniques he's lefthanded and he peddled without turning his shoulder to sway back so he could see better to his right that time couldn't do it see he's a lefthanded passer he come straight back now see he stumbles right there regains his balance sees Buster Stanley number sixty flushes and WHAM here comes his partner Matt Dyson a 16 yard loss Verdell Alexander at the 41 13 returned a 34yard punt see what he did first off it was a lousy punt see the coverage couldn't get there but what's what he does he have tax the coverage people they don't come to Milan see there's Johanna that joke doesn't come to balance either reaching for and he just goes right up inside he's averaged over 13 yards who carry over here the chance Michigan's been waiting for we had motion in there and the Huskies are claiming that Jenkins move and they're right that is a costly penalty down they're going in it'll make it first and 15 he's just a redshirt freshman just a little guy at six foot seven 298 pounds and Don James like that call Harry as there's drizzle I saw him walk by yesterday in it over there by the swimming pool in the hotel what's he gonna be when he grows up go back Wheatley with that inside shuffle pass to the 15yard line and this will still be a long way to go they've got to get inside the three yard line for the first out is Tommie Smith red Wheatley on the play here's Trudel Jenkins number 77 he does a pretty good job there he's wall and he long now he has my me feels outweighed by a hundred pounds that's a pretty good mismatch I want you on my side Raziel it will now be third down for the Wolverines with the ball at the Washington 15yard line tough to run that kind of pattern when they go it on you see they backed off and played zone coverage and it's tough it really is tough to drop it in is Sid Gillman used to say drop it down the stovepipe write down dudes climb the ladder and drop it down the stove I couldn't do it and Alexander's shaken up Smith and haze the wide receivers along with tumor Verbeck has three wide receivers we're in the neighborhood and so was Reggie Orissa there somebody made a mistake there you don't want to receivers at the same spot in throwing a pass pattern because what you do is you draw other defender here's to me the freshman from Vallejo California has bump and run coverage does a good job of getting underneath it see he gets up there but McGee had worked over on him like a tight end seen pose down here right into him too many people shaking hands in the same area 32 yard field goal attempt for Peter Elijah Becker timeout is called by Michigan vilasa back is tuned for 5 from this distance not a gimme it's not that hurt so use a timeout and a field goal attempt because they might have been attempting a fake and they saw something they didn't like down there Tony McGee turned around and called the timeout in Michigan with a first down and the Washington 13 yard line and they failed to score that ball hit the upright ten inches out of the goalposts this would have been good here comes the ball freeze it right there you're seeing there it is on the other side it what it bounced in now it's Brunel in the Huskies leading it by seven two minutes to go on the third quarter the toss to Kaufmann he recovered the fumble the first turnover of this Rose Bowl and it's costly James Pat's him on the shoulder they different approach it to take her the back when he fumbles it sometime to get down sometimes you don't because James just patched him on the back in today let's get ready to play again there it goes actually goes out of there before he gets hit that happens when you lose concentration on the football now remember when they had a first down at the 13 the big tackle moved in custom five now you've got a guy running the football run him running and running a good high draw play just as great gone on a draw a trap got a fullback lead block right there poor attacked by Clippard right there Shane Falco afford course to the ball as a safety speed up in between Amani Toomer gets a good block downfield touchdown 15 carries 235 yards while the Wolverines of their fans Washington around the country talk to running backs a lot of money would see that's unusual Michigan is tied with somebody where were you when I needed you Gary molars gameplan of draw draw trap quick passing has really helped the running game last year they came in here they didn't do a very good job 72 yards rushing they made that in the first quarter coaching all the time coaches always talk that's less miles the offensive line coach he's tell him hey guys I like that draw balk let's just stay with it we'll put draw trapping just runs great draw rocket just like a coach you to do it to the 28yard line and it's washington's turn and you can see the numbers folks if it says it she's been a long ways but quarter mileage run that 49 seconds you know it's a he'll be ready why change at the line break that tackle by hutchinson good discipline by hutchinson remaining in a position to maintain leverage on the football just in case it comes back out door there he was a good job by Chris Hutchinson twotime academic allbig Ten football player getting a little massage back here hey dip whatever it takes just keep running well if the next one tonight on ABC as good as this one this would be some thank Pike Brunel snaps it off to a diving receiver over here on the right side that was Daymond Barry who you know their dad is O'Dell Barry have played for a number of years at the Denver Broncos good football player Darius Turner a little bit late getting the players in Portland's here as a receiver no running backs in this formation they do that time they put the running back in motion like you said Brent he ended up oneonone with Chris Hutchinson going down the sideline if he was not crushed he could throw that it was six points all the way seconds ticking away here on the third quarter when you rush a quarterback that can move around like run out you're really I think smart to assign a defensive woman inside just to squat and wait for them to get there come back for the fourth quarter we may have one for the ages after this message and a word from our ABC stations from Teheran and he had Kralik breaking free on that dick when you run play action like this see now watching makes nice fake see the nice fake heaps in the belly sits back inside now tight and works over inside there no one on him I get see no linebackers around it he throws him completely good job gets his feet back around finds his target lets her go ball at the Michigan 39 Turner and coffin on the outside and puffin past the 30 times in the sea when you're that quick you can hit up inside and if it's not there again you can find a place to slide to you had that quickness to accelerate between before the Packer can fill it good job by Napoleon Kaufman second down we have boat back here we would kind of test is a heart operation that he had a killer cigar what we're seeing a great football game incomplete Danny was under furious rush that time Bo Schembechler I guess my question to you is how often did you get involved in a sixty two point shootout these are the toughest games in the world to coach I want you to know because you're not sure your defense can ever stop the other team from scoring and you know every time you get the ball you have to put some points on the board it is now third down for the Huskies incomplete and interference on where locked up on Damen berry and it was quite clear that it was interference quite cleared that he didn't see the ball no need to interfere couldn't catch him if he had a ladder here's the interference right here he was really working on him is exhausting doesn't look very emotional don't you know the scores died just get me back to the northwest man this smog and the heat and everything down here in Southern California it's no life for a husky now first and 10 an emotion Turner inside the 20yard line nothing much doing there in that Dyson you know I was told by one of the coaches in fact it was Jeff Woodruff that told me to Porter back coach there to Washington and that after Bernal came back from us knee injury he became a better passer he became a better passer he concentrated more on that thinking maybe he would never be able to run as well again but now he has both better passing then the same mobility had part of the operation for the end zone overthrew Shelley did it bridge it down good job of disguising the coverage Brent they showed man the man and dropped off in Webb's own good job good signal call him hard for the quarterback to read it when it's like that here's the numbers you can see Michigan yards rushing to 55 balanced out by Washington's passing to 52 that's the score 31 31 that's the stats time and possession to Washington's favor turnover the one score from Michigan if Washington does not get a first down but for Travis Hanson third and long they have to get to the 10yard line for a first down now stepping to the left fires a flag he took trailing down the flag came flying on Corwin Brown I think it's a good call Brent he got there before the mall that he had a good break on it everything he really went to the ball but he went to the receiver too soon see craley coming off here underneath you're playing a double zone so there's a safety sitting back in there to that side of the field and he sees it see he's there really early no attempt from the ball either just to shoulder pad into him not a good play by Colin brown giving the Huskies a first and goal early in the fourth quarter dole I'm defense on the field for the Wolverines Turner and Jones along with Hoffman and it's Brunel birthday the Wolverines read it properly especially there along with people's good insideout pursuit that matches there's really a good football player and I'll tell you Brunell hurting a little bit right now he's grimacing worse and steps up inside there's the fate now people's coming inside out 90 if number 90 working out there here comes where he terms of backup inside wham he takes it right there on his throwing arm his left arm he took a real good shot he's hurt Coffman picking his way my peoples again you know as I said up here and look down on the field thinking about that first and five on the bowl and knowing how tough Michigan is inside that 5yard line I'm thinking boy what a good time to come with a real strong playaction pass now it's tough to throw on third and five down here really because the defense has all the edges one thing they haven't run though is the quarterback draw real good area to use it with this kind of quarterback I'm sure they have it in their offense I know because I've seen it on tape they do have it Tony Henderson shaken up so he will come to the side and you know who is there again people's well boy you said people's was a real good football player he had a great goal light standing he was in on all three of the place all three of those there could learn Lord up for the formation strength to the left side of your screen say they're trying to leverage the defense get leverage Hutchinson does a good job turns him back into be fools now he gets the rest of people come look at those white jerseys they don't want him in the end zone good job now a 22 yard field goal in tight from the right hash mark he has missed one of two the Wolverines dodged a bullet by Gillian Davis has checked in replacing the injured Wheatley right now what get is the fullback and they usually get who powers his way to the 24yard line on first down so that was the reason why Tyrone Wheatley was not on the field for that kickoff return a short time ago and is one of the reasons why they have been substituting for him frequently here in the second half he has been magnificent but he's carried the ball only 15 times there just had to be a reason for it and I'm glad I found out what it was looks like they're coming after him again now Smith backs off and Kerr back completes in the game just short of a first down Grbac showing real good poise he wanted to throw the flanker curl outside way wide to his right it wasn't there it wasn't there because the defense had worked out underneath it so he comes back inside good job your heart goes out to his Croatian relatives over in Europe lot of them have been right in the heart civil unrest horrible war that's going on and difficult to get a hold of his relatives there is in his final college game handing off Tillich get it goes up over the top for a first down you know the other thing I would be concerned about now if I were molar is I don't have a cinch field goal kicker you know I can't think about just I eaten out the clock driving it down there put it in the proper position and let him pop it through so that changes your thinking in this situation with nine minutes to go tied score 31 31 and you're not sure you want to dump all the responsibility on your field goal kicker who is still in matura and not ready to do maybe the the kind of job it takes to win a ballgame like this but he has it his career long window because he has they were see tight end and grbac hands off to Davis Davis breaks to the 37 yard line so the young man with some huge shoes to fill I know he is replaced Tyrone Wheatley in that Michigan backfield you know each time they put in a back and you study these guys you know it's not just Josh watch this guy was Player of the Year as selected by the USA Today you know they've got some talent there I thought it was all coaching bo no we get on the draw it's gonna be very close let's see where this linesman spots that ball brings I know Rose Bowl last year people can watch Desmond tomorrow on ABC I think he's caught too many balls in the NFL come to think of it so with Dick Vermeil Julie Moran and Bo Schembechler I'm Brent Musburger very nice to have you with us from New Year's Day we settle in now for the last eight minutes with the score tied and go back calling to play at the line he has to there in the bear defense right there we didn't want to go after it Davis gets the first down and he has popped at the 45 bake delegate here it is forced to come over and make the stop they came with again but they didn't use motion to do it they just lined up in it you see what I'm talking about two tight ends to the left side of your screen playaction fake now safety working away no one hiding right there there's by me feels that was the earlier for a 49 touchdown now at 32 yard game five catches for 102 yards davus battling to the 16 yard line and Bo Schembechler tell us a little bit about Davis he is running quite hard right now well he would be the fourth string tailback he's really not that he's a redshirt freshman he's got a lot of talent and he's got a lot of sweet they have a lot of tail blacks I don't know of any team in the country that has as many good tail backs of Michigan now what we did was just hurt the recruiting program they just have to get one more here's Davis good defense to the 15yard line must get inside the 13 for a first down Reggie regi did a real nice job become he's filling in real well for not having been the starter redshirt freshman out of John Muir high school right here in Pasadena he's playing in front of his home crowd no wonder he's playing so well the Huskies have been really tough inside the twenty this year Michigan well they said they were going to get the balls to the tide and more second time the tide head is kind of touchdown going to the corner here he is oneonone coverage on linebacker wide receivers tightening inside piney field and outside linebacker has to cover him couldn't get it done watch even better than Ron van der Kellen got into a shootout now it is the short man is Joan Matt Jones bringing it up it hasn't been the quarterbacks but it certainly has been a running back Tyrone Wheatley was having a effort to get him back he's carried 15 times for 235 yards and three touchdowns won an 88 yarder which is the longest run ever in the Rose Bowl I think here it's critical that they use high percentage passing don't try to get this thing back to a tie situation in one or two plays just take your time be patient you got a lot of it we have all three timeouts there's berry to the 35yard line here's another school with a lot of fun running backs we're watching play the University of Shelly leaves Tasha here comes bjornsen looking for that pass bjornsen standing in fires to a diving receiver but it was too low at midfield this one will be waved off bjornsen did a good job he had the post pattern comfortable he had the post pattern covered now it was a reverse it was a reverse past they wanted to throw the post pattern down here the safety stood back presence in mind because he is a converted quarterback he goes to a secondary receiver real good job of getting it there otherwise it's a way to play it ends up being incomplete anyway because he throws a little bit low but good judgment on his part tough spot to use a trick play very shy and third and now that was a real gutsy call at that moment in this game Brunel and he picks it up the young freshmen made a mistake on this one say quarterback looking away looking away looking away comes back good boys good protection now ty law comes up here just make the tackle see just come up to balance and make the tackle that should not have happened now what Don James must be thinking about is we come down to 425 this get his staff ready to call a twopoint play if they do bounce it in they'll go for the win in this situation now it's Brunel snaps one off to Kralik depending on the spot we're talking about you know Washington is 2 for 3 in that situation this year and that's really good yeah I mean that's a high percentage of twopoint success they come down to the final four minutes with all three of their timeouts molar and Michigan used one Aggie remember had to call it during what appeared to be a fake field goal situation Wolverines have to its first and ten and now Washington is going to use one would be Henderson he was ie throw outsider awfully quick one to the other holy mackerel did he get off you'll see it right in the center of your screen right here you'll see these two people right in here to watch the British boom right through there they snap it early the right guard was not ready for the ball to be snapped on that and he came through the opening because the defensive lineman moves when the ball moves now second down off the fake for now for craley and the under threw him incomplete in the endzone when we're covering when that's a tough pattern to cover they take the outside leaves even run into the post run the slot man out and up that's tough to cover in that kind of coverage especially both Hendersons play looms ever so large now 3 minutes and 21 seconds to play michigan leading by 7 and it will be third and 11 for the Huskies you see by trying to get it all in one play though see you leave yourself in third and 11 why not 5 and 6 yards at a time much easier higher percentage now Shelly grabbed the ball I think people's got that thing knocked out before he had control of it Brent you're right good defensive play by the peoples you see the tail end of this play right here to the left side of your screen it looks like it's going in there it didn't go it went out before people's got there good job of stepping up inside finally under pressure real good defensive series but there's still a lot of time in the clock and a game and can't assume they've already won the football game they can't run out the clock they've got to play good football I've seen teams lose games by celebrating too early Brent I've been involved with him as a coach so if you're right Bo you're absolutely right they've got to move this ball and get a first down or to Davis battling for a couple of yards as Tyrone Wheatley unable to return because of those severe leg cramps Washington had two timeouts remaining as did Michigan it just used one of them points this is just a good eye draw play see now the tailback will set one way now see him set pause there it is no trap good lead block by Leggett right there at the point of a deck super job by Leggett he gets through there now he's into the secondary again there's only one safety back there he has that was such a huge moment for Ricky powers who has missed games this year because of an injured ankle he has watched Tyrone Wheatley move into that starring position now its first and ten for the Wolverines that bear defense again came in to help Mason it almost looks like that's the problem sometimes with rotating backs in there you know little different mechanics had taken the ball from the quarterback to tight ends he's going to get back there Hannity covered the ball good penetration by the Husky defense there's a football player Hoffman but we got a lot of football players in this field in it you can tell by looking at their hats go back bringing the clock down snapping it on two or three here on this third and Michigan forced to punt so as you predicted to Washington you got it back now they're going to get it back now what's your feeling about going all out to block a punt in this situation you two guys yeah you know my feeling unblock the plane I'll let you talk first so I got a great return you guys back if you rough the kicker it's over yeah you got a go for it you got to go for a punt return and I agree with you and say what happened give your give the ball to your quarterback and see you got a chance yes you don't have any timeouts left but you got a mobile quarterback Jason Shelley Washington takes over at the Michigan it was a high snap almost over the top of the head not a time to get a bad snap the rush comes from the right side see the highest now that breaks your rhythm here it is right there he lays out it doesn't operate good job but getting to the bottom right side of your screen perfect job that was Kilpatrick that got in there and got it number 35 well good thing we didn't call that one no comment now Washington is without a timeout they have a first down Brunell throws high and incomplete to Shelley so Mark Brunell playing in his third straight Rose Bowl two years ago he was the MVP and now he has the career passing yardage record he'd rather have the points leading right now I think firing hi intercepted as meloni had a shot at it you know when Damon Mac was crossing over there in behind that and heat the ball was almost tipped to him and molar wonder is how could it not catch that ball now third down for the husbands Wolverine's Michigan defense doing a good job of trying to funnel everybody back inside don't let him catch the book we want to run around the inside fine but go ahead and get he had burners set up for the first down they threw the ball a little bit high and the Huskies are down to four I'm so I'm surprised the defenders sagged often enough to allow the first down catch you would think they would be crowding that that marker see if they're sagged off they're in a double zone but the corner has rolled off hasn't rolled up see he's back there he has help behind him to get they allowed this man to get to the first down position not good defense snaps it incomplete Michigan's ball out of timeouts this feels like beating Wisconsin to you though they're both given 38 not exactly that way you'd get 38 the Rose Bowl I'd say a both team but good an excellent football game fun to present you
