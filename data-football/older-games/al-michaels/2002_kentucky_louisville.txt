============================================================

trophy for the Cardinals it's their Heisman hopeful quarterback Dayton Virgo a twotime Conference USA offensive player of the year against Jared Laurentian the hefty lefty who last year finished up his final five games by throwing for 300 yards or more in each of them strap yourself in they're going to be some fireworks it's the weave out versus Kentucky right here on espn2 now here's restates it's college football on ESPN 2 from Louisville Kentucky is the number 18 Cardinals host their crossstate rivals the University of Kentucky Wildcats hi everybody mark wall along with my broadcast partner Sean Saul's very glad you could be with us here a lot more at stake for the Cardinals in the governor's trophy there have been whispers they could be the first not VCS team to crash the bowl party this year if that's going to happen Dave were going there Heisman hopeful quarterback is going to have to put up Heisman like numbers and it's got to start tonight and their head coach Coach Smith has tried to temper that excitement because he said they haven't had too many great practices this fall couple that with the changes for new ones on offensive line two new starters and wide receiver three new offensive coaches one including the offensive coordinator they need to temper that little come out here smoking early on line their opponent the University of Kentucky well they've been crippled by probation their second year head coach guy Morris has been left to pick up the pieces playing for his job a win over this football team the Cardinals would make their C's there's no question about we got to give coach Coach Morris a chance with the hand that he's been dealt but if the cut the Wildcats get to four or five victories this year they will stand on their head this football team needs to deal with the Louisville pressure defense to have any kind of chance so John L Smith the head coach of the Louisville Cardinals in his fifth season here has done a wonderful job at 34 and 15 he's turned programs around everywhere he has been an old cowboy from Idaho as Kentucky has won the toss weighted Logica will be kicking off the junior 511 199 pounds number five Arles Beach a freshman running back deep to the turn brought down about the 24 yard line so Kentucky takes the ball in the hefty lefty Jarrett Lorenzen perhaps the heaviest player ever to play the quarterback position at this level says he's listed at 275 yeah mark are you buying that he told us he's between 292 and 300 pounds and I guarantee looking at the game he's 305 it's hard to imagine somebody that large actually playing the quarterback position but he can sling it look for this screen right off the bat here mark take a look at the rest of the Kentucky offense Pinner who just got the screen hoping to get 20 to 25 touches tonight Derek Abdi who received the kickoff the leading receiver 66 with six touchdowns a year ago harp the tight end offensive line averaging about six foot five just under 300 pounds are anchored by their big left guard Jason Rollins second and 14 I formation Lorenzen audibly take a look at that Louisville defense up front they're led by the defensive end Dwayne white 15 of his career 27 sacks came last year that the linebacker spot radhe the first year starter Michael Brown the bandit position the unsung hero in this defense is secondary one the best in the country 17 interceptions a year ago featuring the curry burns and Anthony Floyd at the safety spots third and 14 from the shotgun Dwayne white Devon Thomas what's your not the way you want to start off your opening series on the road three negatives here we go the already in long yardage situation we said they got to deal with the pressure Lorenzen not exactly fleet of foot no shot they're going to force the punt three and out not a way you want to start this football game Mark White says he likes the bulrush he bulrush there the first punt tonight by Glenn back alack he seized on the 45 yard line by Anthony makes a couple people miss and finally brought down at the 43 yard line a return of 12 yards on the play now Louisville gets the ball de Burgh on the Heisman candidate hopeful over 3,000 yards passing a year ago and 23 touchdowns Shawn he could have gone to the NFL for millions in a firstround pick but he told his teammates he made a commitment to the guys who came in with he wanted to come back and finish up and he did just that should be a big season for this good both quarterbacks tonight lefthanded somewhat unusual pick and lefthanded I think they are shotgun formation for wide receivers go takes off and it's tripped up sort of fumble on the play Jeremy Connell on the play for the Wildcats it's ruled down though fumbles you take a look now that Kentucky defense they're anchored five is six foot three 311 pound Dwayne Robertson and linebacker the fifth year senior Ron Riley who missed all of last year with knee surgery will make all the defensive balls tonight and the secondary is a veteran one but they are a little bit banged up Leonard Burris a hernia derrick Tatum has a need that's Lionel gates making his first career start at running back the sophomore 6foot 224 pounds picks up a couple you know mark interesting Ronnie Riley the inside linebacker senior for Kentucky said he didn't believe that Louisville could run the football on they were going to have to pass to beat him he felt Kentucky's front seven was far more physical or really in front eight is what they run far more physical than Louisville was in the one game well the Louisville offensive line has been rebuilt Kunz really the only returning starter they're probably trying to protect him a little bit by running the ball at good pass here is the returning heating receiver on this football team and that's good enough for a first down that's real simple play mark with the three wives and we know jet is their leading receiver it's a good person to lean on if you're the quarterback a third down a you see we're going set to speed quickly nobody ran in the simple zone wrap it will out cut Jeff gets it moves the chains you'll see a lot of that today from their best wide receiver if you want to call him a tight in but he's got the most catches on that team 11 yards on the completion come be the free safety making the stop to tight end shotgun vault into the air in complete what we're seeing early on here again with this young offensive line is the ball getting out real quick Shawn yeah you've seen every pass mark he's taken quick one or two three as we see on the replay you got to create a new line of scrimmage not on the run gaming in the past also getting pressure in regards face the greatest thing you can do is alignment get your hand up hey you saw burns get his hand up there knock the ball down if you're going to get blocked make it difficult on the big lefthander to make the completion so we're at second and Ted now for new starters on that offensive line for the Cardinals in motion jr. Russell immediate pressure that's a ladder now they're wicked now incomplete it looked like a lateral ameesha oh they missed one there they missed one there I'll take a look at this mark remember a lateral is where the quarterback is if it goes back you're gonna watch this ball come back here here's where it should be for an incomplete take a look at this down and the courts to where we're going lines up there start at the sixth goes about there at the 36 and a half that is a fumble but hey that's why we're up here third down not a whole lot of plays here played with on third and ten Nihon dodges a bullet there big third down conversion for the Cardinals is the wide receiving core and that's that's what we call the coverage sack five on the play Otis Grigsby number 18 along with John Robinson on the play you bet mark their total defense Kentucky's was 109 last year which is not good enough to beat a high school team but you saw the secondary get on these receivers and their young receivers new starters for the most part here when you lose branch last year this is a very very important series for Kentucky to get them out of there and forced this long field goal attempt great job by their defense under pressure all right so the Cardinals are going to try a field goal here Nate Smith who will try a 52yard or on this one his numbers blondeness 48 against Southern Miss last October and this one's on its way it's long enough but it's wide left and so the Cardinals move the ball down the field but under pressure a skal the drive and missed the field goal right now we're at 00 with a little over 10 minutes to play in the first quarter out cats the cats taken over on downs charrid Laurentian the biggest man playing quarterback let's introduce you now to our third member of the broadcast team Tracy Wolfson thanks guys well what we're all speculating on how much Lorenzen actually weighs Rendon to lose some weight so we decided to focus more on the conditioning well Rendon says he has been running every day all summer all spring and he is in the best shape of his life well we'll see if he can last all four quarters and we'll also see if without discipline he can keep that weight off throughout the season all right thank you very much it's going to be interesting indeed Penner on the carry there for one yard for Kentucky makes it second and nine you'll notice that he spent a lot of time for the shotgun although he's under center on this play no place to go finally unloads it out of bounds that's okay because I like the fat Luther Vandross better done skinny one anyway what I loved about to find the last play was market let's not let's take the fact this kid could throw the football he can is it instead of taking a sack and trying to do something stupid and he told us he's tried to force too many balls costume intercepts throw it out of bounds let's read T it I know it's third down just be smart keep your team from turnovers and it'll be a better opportunity for you I don't envy guy Morris as he tries to reign in this very talented quarterback 39 now for Kentucky under pressure that will slip screen 64yard earnest sense said he was the home run threat on this football team and interestingly enough guy Morris and his staff spent some time with the st. Louis Rams this offseason trying to find out how they work their screen game and there is a perfect example of how it works and market is absolutely unbelievable talk about pressure I expect them to run ten or fifteen screens today if you want to deal with pressure we'll get a chance to see that in a second after this kick butt unbelievable job of hitting it with accuracy and get themself going the extra point is up and it's good and Kentucky finds themselves leading early in this football game with nine eleven to play great job when you get the ball guys who can run they're going to put a lot of pressure on Lorenzen he does a great job at setting up the screen little pump fake accurate throw deal with the pressure that's where the screen is draw the rush and the rest is history get a man in the open field for a touchdown speed here it is again pressure pump fake they didn't get to the big fella that time result big play on the road way to set the tone after a horrible first offensive series for they did not even block Keyshawn Lowe they just let him go and then Simms did the rest nobody was going to catch him 64 yards on the play and all of a sudden this crowd has gotten a little quiet here in Papa John's Dan you remember the first play from scrimmage for them was at trying to fill the screen to the tight inside the closed side or what they did their little fake to the closed side come back to the open side and those were screens receiver streams could be awesome mark if you get the ball in the fast guys hands great job by Simms accurate throw by Lorenzen this is herself an early ballgame and it's indicative of what we expect here a lot of quick scoring three plays 65 yards in under a minute for Kentucky and now the pressure is on Dave Regan and the Cardinals as we await the kickoff tailored begley doing the duties and he sends it deep out of the back of the end zone there'll be no return there Broderick Clark fields it and now it's Davy Jones turn tremendous amount of pressure decided to return for his senior year and I'll tell you what this is a committed guy who has a big arm and a very focused individual and mark he cares about his teammates there you see the passing yards which will go up even though he's got new guys Conference USA Player of the Year for two years in a row the key one here is every 55 passes one pick so even though he's got the big arm and they put all the pressure on him he does not throw the ball to the other team he will keep Louisville in every game this year because of it right now 1 of 3 11 yards he's been sacked once and under pressure early on Y negates the sophomore running back he made his first career start tonight it's the carry that's good for 4 yards off the right side Dustin Williams with a stop at mark we talked about we're going in Louisville as a passing you know they lose branch at Carver last year two big time players but the thing about this is you've got to make some commitment to the run regardless how good your quarterback is we've seen at the NFL with Farva with Peyton last year Manning that if you're not running the ball you got injuries and he put all the pressure on the quarterback you get yourself in trouble I agree and John L Smith was concerned about this young offensive line wanted to protect him early we have a three wide set no protection here empty backfield the back motioning outs ball down the field under pressure incomplete intended for gents the tied in but again pressure in his face even when he gets it out on time shot and that is what Kentucky wanted to do give a bunch of different looks and pressure we're gonna knock him on his back and we're gonna track how many times they hit him in the mouth this football game it's not just sacks marques you and I both play the position it's those pressures and those hips in the mouth that start to wear on you throughout the football game they add up and let's again remind you that this is a revamp wide receiver core they lost their to top wide receivers branch and Parker as they faced third and six now get under pressure again he missed his intended for Damien Dorsey the senior 57 172 pounds and again they face fourth down and a pun knocked to the ground again we're gonna imagine he's gonna start getting some people's face that's untouched guy down there the bottom of your screen hits him knocks it to the ground and you saw the route mark it looks like timings a little off and we expected that early on for Louisville you like I say Louisville Lulu I got it down right been around here you've had a couple of mint juleps Wade did lots good he's back to punt Derick Abdi go to wide receiver for Kentucky to receive fair catch so Kentucky now will take over on the 38 yard line a 307 punt no return we're back to Louisville Kentucky leading 7th to the Derby City Louisville Kentucky is the number 18 ranked Cardinals are hosting the University of Kentucky Wildcats the cats out to a fast 7 to nothing start on John L Smith Cardinals and they take over first in 10 from the 38 yard line slot right eye formation drop way artoo scanner let's go down now to the sidelines in Tracy Wolfson while Kentucky's issue this year is depth so they had to find some way to avoid injuries during the summer so what they did was the only practice in full pads two times all summer naturally lessens their scrimmages and the practices hoping to avoid ng any injuries so we'll see if they can continue doing that but we'll also see if that they can avoid the injury because by not tackling and not bringing the guy down to the ground and not making those big tackles that can really hurt them all right Tracy will keep as Lorenzen scrambles away from trouble dumps it out picks up 17 yards the conditioning certainly starts with the quarterback but a lot of movement from this football team in Lorenzen even though he's probably bordering 300 pounds no doubt about it he's not he doesn't have any bricks on his feet take a look at this it's a big man with some really good feet buying himself some time that's the main position at quarterback what you got to do buy time to enable you to do this nice soft touch grabs on the first town that's a huge play and he's just not got the cannon he's got all the throws they run the football up inside tough with Penner again trying to get him at least 20 to 25 carries in this ball game to slow down that Cardinal offense he picks up four on that play and you know Mark what Tracy said about conditioning and we'll see how that works out but there's two ways to look at it do you want fresh legs which coach obviously Morris needed but the other side and we know coach John L Smith said he doesn't know how his team would do that by not tackling people to the ground so it's all about that intensity it looks early on like Kentucky's taking on that accountability what surprises me is they're there it's just not finesse they're running the football here at the Cardinals on second and six and again Penner right up the middle between the tackles picks up about another three yards on the play and this guy what had about 100 carries last year for a little over 400 yards a guide they really believe has NFL talent in there making it a point that he's going to be a bigger part of the offense this year not only that mark you've got a guy who could get out in the yoke and feel that one and that's they've got him listed there 219 folks told us yesterday 248 pounds he's bigtime 32 will she be gets the ball on this carry got double tight end I formation and bang again right between the tackles coming up for a first down and right now it's about attitude they're just taking it to that Cardinal defense Clark you hit it right on the head it's all about attitude and short yards I don't I don't care if you put 11 guys up there whoever beats low man wins usually nice cliche but they do they get down they push him off create a new line of scrimmage and that's telling their Kentucky team coach Morrison we're not just a passing team we're going to set the tempo up front gives those five big fellas up front confidence let's remind you that this Louisville defense was 10th in the nation in scoring defense a year ago giving up just a little over 17 points again Lorenzen back to pass looking deep down the sideline to the left side his favorite targets Derrick Abney but it comes up incomplete Josh Mickens on the play one of the better secondaries in America and the reason I like this even though it's incomplete there you see Abney take your chances there's no better coverage in the world for a receiver in a cornerback then one on one take your shots make those guys get off to make them respect you but that secondary is very very good for Louisville they have to be coming back this year he had sixty six receptions a year ago the five second and ten from the shotgun under pressure screen to the right but it is broken up by Bharati gala Shah does a great job reading the screen coming up and making the play looks to be a little shaken up hold us back let's take a closer look now mark it's okay to throw the ball away on a screen they do a nice job of reading it there's three on one three bodies on defense gets one on offense and those are the ones Lorenzen he takes a hit don't be afraid to filled out when out of bounds could have been a costly costly boil you can't tell which is the defensive lineman land on third in 10 and we've got a flag on the play play is blown dead it's like a legal procedure on Kentucky well mark we're what midway through the first quarter we've had three screens now at the University of Kentucky they're trying to keep that pressure off prior to the snap well start well thanks welfare down and our first flag of the night it's been relatively clean so far but this can be a drive killer you jump out to a 7up and start you come out with a little attitude the next drive you run it down their throats you're moving the football down the field and all of a sudden you get a costly penalty to make it but third and 14 right now ended 15 you'd love to come out of this was three if you can out of his shotgun blitz make some miss dumps it over the to number 84 jeremiah dropped me good for 12 yards but short of the first down but you know what mark that's okay now you put into a situation where we got it we're in field goal range instead of he in 52 yards now we give our kicker a chance Lorenzen one of the great shows in college football once again has but time give his team a chance now you put him at field goal range keep points on the board at least give yourself a team a chance to go up 10 to nothing again he's almost 300 pounds but he makes the free Blitzer miss and that brings on the field down Taylor Begley the redshirt freshman from 41 yards this to make a 10 nothing Wildcats is down it's most of it he had 20 there that one good from 41 yards and all of a sudden the Wildcats who shock at everybody find themselves up ten nothing k'daybra' gone and the Cardinals ranked 18th in the country come back we'll find out when we return the NFA trailing 10 to nothing that's the senior Damien Dorsey trying to keep guys going tell you what the stadium is a little bit stunned as well sure they are this sea of red mark Kentucky comes down the road and lets him know right off the bat that's gonna be a full quarter ball going so Kentucky kicks off back to reseed Broderick Clark takes it up the middle and has stopped immediately at the 20 yard line sixteen yards on the return Dustin Williams on the tackle number 59 let's take a look at the drive chart now for the Wildcats on this again after the big 64 yards screen pass to Ernest Sims to jump out to a seven nothing lead they put a nine play 39 yard drive together three minutes and 38 seconds to the 41 yard field goal by Begley and find themselves subtend enough and a two key players were Lorenzen by in time getting guys the ball 1 for a first down 1 to get him in field goal range playaction for a goal rolling to his right throws to damien dorsey he's blanketed on the play by claude Segal and the Cardinals now find themselves second and 10 well how can he not be impressed with the defense of Kentucky right now we've talked a lot of offense but they're keeping we're going in long yardage situations they're pressuring him every time and those corners are bellied up playing that press man because they've been laughed at from last year being that did that bad is bad as they will know we see Louisville not moving the pocket trying to get rag on some time he's 1 for 6 11 yards five straight incompletions now for the Heisman hopeful from the shotgun plenty of time now over the middle receiver falling down and you have a flat Tiger Jones was the intended receiver Leonard Buress was the man who the flag was thrown at the parents defense football that first down again we gone under pressure to the ground mark it takes a long to a lot of times we get a 6'5 body up on a regular basis and you know what even there was a penalty in Kentucky I'll take that aggressiveness I don't want to take that away from guys draped all over them still looking for some confidence is that louisville offense all right first and 10 from Louisville wing left slot right and they're running the ball with the two tight inside TJ Patterson on the carry the junior for about three yards and a guy that they said is great on pass protection he's smart mentally he's great but he just doesn't have the real breakaway speed that you get from Lionel gates which is why gates started the game so that's exactly right now when you drop it back you want blitz protection Patterson's the guy but you want open field open space guy who can make bigger plays for you it's Lionel gates but it looks to me like the run game is just almost a passing it's just like a let's just get this run game Nick's tentative pressure off for going they're gonna have to pass again out of the shotgun three wide receivers Jones in motion three Blitzer Jones ends up with the reception a hot route here when you got the free blitz or coming off the edge it's free blitz yes but look at him put the blanket on jet while you're looking for a hot route they pressure we're going do exactly what they're supposed to do run with them take a look at Dorsey now the most experienced receiver no we're going to play him pressure too and make them make the perfect throw love what Kentucky's doing on defense and once again Brooke going was under pressure big down third and seven to keep the drive alive three wide receivers one back shotgun formation plenty of time plenty of time nobody no good in a sack the sack on the play as we go goes down again Ellery more the sophomores 63 289 pounds and again this is a coverage sack you bet it is the motors running by the defensive line at Kentucky but coverage all over them and let's give a little bit but this pressure goes to our gun you can hold the ball for so long but you're a veteran throw that football away don't take the sack Jason weathers giving up the sack at the right guard position and that brings on Wade good Logica jarick epi starts out to the left makes a man miss finally brought down just past midfield 35 yards on the punt 11 yards on the return let's send it down to our broadcast partner Tracy Wolfson Clement is known for making the Louisville Slugger bat but I am with a Louisville Slugger right now Aaron Alvey hit the gamewinning home run in the Little League World Series against Japan and Aaron what has life been like since winning that championship it's been crazy the publicity has been crazy too and well all these every time I go out and sign autographs and I love it just another grace for everybody tell us some of the things you've been doing so far I know there's a parade tomorrow but what are some of the highlights that you've done so far I come to this game and Louisville Kentucky game I cannot wait to the rubezh game I once did a couple of things with our team and everything so you've had so many storm moments as has your team throughout these World Series tell us what your favorite what your best memory was my best memory was when you last that one cases Jordan caught that line drive which that that was my best memory and I think case of Georgia for doing that for me well congratulations I know your need meeting President Bush this week good luck and just enjoy it back to you guys all right Tracy thank you very much certainly have become heroes Kentucky is Abney picks up the reception they're good for 4 yards that'll bring up a third down in Kentucky but you can't hit a baseball that far kid yes I'll tell you what this kid could you know can go on to play major league baseball and have a 20 year pro career nothing is going to beat that memory of pitching that well on that night and hitting that home and being the guy who delivers up the tapemeasure job in that first believe it look good to Louisville that's great dick to Kentucky the way they're playing right now to third and four for the Wildcats Lorenzen in the shotgun three wide receivers going deep down the left sideline he had a man Ernest since he got a 64yard touchdown earlier today down the left sideline but just overthrows him that's that shot up in the hole mark that you want to make that throw and you got a guy who beats press coverage and gets up and cover and just missed it a little bit high but with that cannon there's gonna be a few that are gonna end up in the first row second row he was mechanics aren't the best it's not one of those things you say hey and you and I talked about this you know I say this if he's that passionate about his game if he loves football that much and he wants to be a good quarterback then be disciplined enough to be 265 anyways not 300 pounds not since he's been 12 so Kentucky on the pot this one's beep 43 yards a touch back just to remind of the tomorrow Gino Dooley and the Cincinnati Bearcats open their Conference USA schedule as they host Adrian MIDI sand the TCU Horned Frogs calyx Football on ESPN tomorrow at 4:30 Eastern for more information log on to espn.com flag on the play unsportsmanlike conduct after the play was over dead ball personal foul on the receivers this will be half the distance or football be put on the 10yard line first Albert what we're seeing here is a lot of frustration now from John L Smith Louisville Cardinals down 10 nothing as we approach the end of the first quarter mark the frustration you know they expect to come in here and although they didn't have great fall practices like Coach Smith told us and it's showing it's showing he didn't like the rhythm of the way they were practicing and these are the things the little things that become big things the discipline that kills you get personal fouls in the ball should be on the tiller are the last three years they have dominated this rivalry so this is a bit of a shot so first and ten they take over on downs from about the 10yard line shotgun formation intended receiver Lionel gates tell you what the pressure there you go wiggle of rennes in four of eight 97 yards and bought some time on some others nice touch now we're gone the two of eight and let's not forget all the pressure he's been under even the last play mark forcing him out on a little short route this is not a team in rhythm Lorenzen obviously getting the best this one early there's no doubt about that again we haven't seen a lot of deep balls or at least deep connections made they've been short ball screens dumped off but unrelenting pressure from the UK defense on this one second and ten gates gets the ball off the right tackle it's maybe a yard mark we talked about the pressure and give it Kentucky's defense been the MVP to date right here in this game six here he's five knockdowns and two sacks already for the first quarter what Dave Lacombe and that brings us to the end of the first quarter we'll be back with more college football action as number 18 ranked Louisville finds himself trailing Ted nothing the Kentucky said nothing to the University of Kentucky Wildcats as we resume play in the second quarter this a big third down conversion for Louisville they find themselves backed up little dash to the left for a go nothing open touched the ball and he smothered by a wildcat defenders Vincent burns leads that leads the charge for Kentucky we keep talking about Louisville's corners take a look at this coverage now here by Kentucky man to flatten up and double team on Dorsey their best receiver coming back that is unrelenting pressure not only up front the foursome are going on the dash nice job by Kentucky that secondaries playing lightsout so today odka will punt two punts tonight already of 38 and 35 yards just inside his own endzone that was close nice pun a fair catch call by Abney and the Wildcats will take over possession on the 45 yard line 43 yards on the punt you just joined us let's get you caught up on the first half action so far Dave Berg on of Louisville has been under pressure for new offensive linemen they've taken its toll he's been beat and battered around while the 300pounder Jerez Lorenzen has found a way to move around the pocket get the ball out and get the Wildcats up early Ted nothing what has been a shocker so far here in Louisville first to 10 Lorenzen under center and they hand the ball off inside to number 20 our two spinner good for four yards on the play they've got a second effort in that mark here it's hit at the line of scrimmage I'm always looking for backs that can fall forward and that 238 pounds that they talked about the blade he's gained he's sure helped him at the line of scrimmage he will have to continue to play well the to pressure off number 22 right there we're staying up inside against Leffew and Lopez trying to stay away from Dwayne whites at 15 sacks last year and he is a man second at six rented under pressure can't get it off and got a flag on the play however Duane white was the man putting the pressure nice spin move mark we talk yes to him yesterday and he told us it he watches their circle faster underneath 5yard penalty from the previous spot repeat the down keep your eye on Dwayne right here at the bottom of your screen there's a little spin move move inside move outside says he studies the players like Strahan to try and learn a move puts it to work on the practice field but Aaron went to work this isn't just a guy who bullrushes market talk to he's trying to be a versatile player that you can't concentrate on just one pass rush 27 career sacks most of the NCAA right now of any active player second and one and immediately Dwayne white back and and swarming Lorenzen for the sack and what we say he doesn't just have a bull rush but you know what he uses this bull rush this is you can't do this unblock a guy like that or miss him especially maybe the best defensive end of the United States Lorenzen no chance got to put a body on him at design they're two in two consecutive plays they've asked the running back to block the way in white he is six foot three and two Kentucky made the mistake clock earlier this week said it doesn't matter where he lines up we don't care about the laneway will they better start Karen Kentucky is 205 on third down this is third and six out of the shotgun for the Reds down intercepted Anthony Floyd had the ball go in and out of his hands as the receivers slipped coming out of the break can't fall down they got away with one of their Lorenza threw it on time see if it falls down almost an interception they'll have to punt to get back to that Dwayne white mark there you see now comes out of it nice not even any contact by the DB keep your feet it's what you get scholarship pay for got to stay up on your feet almost an interception they got away with it get back to Dwayne white the defensive end mark you can't block him with a 200pound back no you can this not a good design I think I'd had that conversation on the sideline if I was Lorenz and his head coach there's punt is out of bounds it'll be marked at about the 24 yard line 28 yards on the punt we're back with more football for Louisville after this defensive coordinator and Chris Nilan trying to get his defense cranked up we have not been the kind of defense we thought we would see here tonight better get this offense cranked up first to ten first to ten and we have a flag on the play before the plays gets off illegal snail offense fiveyard penalty first down and again we can see now I mean this is just adds to what we've been talking about with this new offensive line shuttle II Dan Kunz the center is the guy that's returning everybody else is brand new here there's no doubt and I understand physical mistakes mark but I don't give a hoot if you're a freshman or a senior you can't move before the ball snap before the play starts first and 15 now they started a whole ban right off the bat Otis Grigsby nails lionel gates in the backfield and now they dig themselves a deeper hole Terry Spencer you got to do more than this you got to help out offensive lineman gets beat right off the bat no shot Grigsby gets across the line of scrimmage there's Otis right there and really not a powerful guy me sure look powerful on our 253 pounds more of a speed rusher but again just just horrible technique and execution by the offensive line second and 19 now for Louisville latch play stop Cardinals can't do anything right I assure you if this continues yeah well start offense penalty go second now I assure you if this continues mark Jarnell will go all off on these guys in the locker room and he's an old Idaho cowboy we see him there you could you could just tell he's human he is a drill sergeant they hit they go after he's an old school guy he has just got to be about ready to blow a gasket right now the crown is not loud right now you got the offensive side of the ball you're right there and listen to your quarterback it's inexcusable you're gonna miss a block every now and then but don't make the mental errors because we're Gold's gonna start to go off himself second and 24 need to pick up at least half of this pressure right off the bat unblock who don't somehow escape some facts about the character at about the 30 33 yard line when he played by Dave Berg um picking up 22 on the play and he told us yesterday market talking with him as we take a look at the replay then when their team struggles every now and then he loves to run out of the pocket and he said Bing if he wanted a slide he'd be a baseball player this is a big 65 260 pound body but take a look at this he's not going to the sideline he's going to take someone on he does just that gets more than half it back like you said mark and now does Louie go respond the rest of the 10 guys and say that's what our leader does we got to answer that it makes it third in the one what looked to be in a possible situation that looks like a makeable down quick pass and it's tipped right off of the bat of notice Grigsby number 18 coming up big twice on this drive and now we're going and Louisville Ola they get themselves out of the hole again cannot convert on third down here's Grigsby here is gonna get here but he's gonna jump mark he's gonna jump he can't get to the quarterback you know perfect great job you realize you're not going to get there on a threestep drop jump up make them play use that body for something bricks means make two great plays in this series and if you're smart Louisville next time a guy jumps to give you a rib shot to keep him on the ground waited Logica back to pend his last punt a 42 yarder that ended in a fair catch this one almost blocked way up in the air high but shorts and will be out of bounds just past midfield as the two star John right now the University of Kentucky all over Louisville it's been pressured from the opening bell in Kentucky has Louisville rattle tendon everybody and welcome back to Louisville as the Cardinals find themselves trailing 10 nothing 3 yards on the pickup for Kentucky will bring up a second and 7 we've got an injured player on the field you know Mark what's interesting about this is that everybody talks about Kentucky as being a fun s football team for the most part you know they're finesse on defense and weren't very good Lorenzen who throws last year five straight 300 plus yard passing games but in this game so far it is a physical tailwhip and that they're given Louisville forget the finesse they're whipping him up front curry burns the strong safety who led the team in tackles a year ago with a hundred and seven is down on the field right now espn2 is presentation of primetime college football brought to you by Circuit City we know how you feel that's why we're here a Circuit City we're with you that is the school of law here on the University of Louisville campus this is Papa John's Stadium set it down to the field in our cohort Tracy Wolfson Tracy well as you can see behind me this rivalry extends way beyond the hardwood for years it was UK that had everything on the line there from the bigger conference a bigger school at state school but now UL comes in and they have not everything to lose UK's trying to spoil their season Louisville preseason top 20 Dave we're going hopeful this is their most anticipated season and if the cats can come out and get a win tonight it will spoil a season that Louisville has been ridden a lifetime for there's no doubt about that Tracy thank you very much dinner there that carry no gain but this rivalry which was gone for what 70 years Sean they played six times between 1912 and 24 then the series resumed in 94 when we talked to players I mean they're all about their there is a chip on their shoulder there's some real hatred between there's no down and mark and it's a respectful hatred but you know people say why play this rivalry so early this jump starts the season for these two teams and I love it and a rivalries when there's competitiveness and this one makes for the rivalry was a win would make Kentucky's season program on probation as Jared Lorenzen rolls left and fires the cannon downfield that's going to be good enough for a first down Aaron Boone number 13 the playmaker on this football team comes up with a reception good for 12 yards well I've been waiting for this mark a double team on to Wayne white at the top of your screen don't leave one on him there you see smart move keep your best football player away and then we see the route at the other in Abney here possession receiver Pusha nice job coming back to the football or ends and puts it where only his guy can catch it first down i formation slot right 1st and 10 playaction going deep got a man oneonone but great play broken up by Lonnie Gallo Shaw Abney the intended receiver and he had what he wanted manonman coverage looking to put the dagger yes it's great fake by Lorenza but what you got to do is get the ball up a little quicker here this guy had him beat early yeah when you set your feet throw the football he took that extra crawl hop in there that allowed a good secondary to stay on and had him beat but he hesitated just a second comes out of the a well when he touched that ball in his gut to hide it nobody sees it the play action second and 10 hence the ball off to Alexis in game 4 yards on the carry and Mark this makes it manageable makes it very manageable I give the football get it in there now you're 36 you've got an opportunity to mix it you can either draw you can screen him he can throw the football and now with the completion even come up with the first down you'd give your field goal team another chance points you've got the 10nothing lead you can take your time and run the football now milk the clock a little good shotgun formation third and six twenty of time the pressure comes a couple of the fingers moving goes down Tyrone Satterfield he's johnnyonthespot number 93 the sophomore 319 pounds great coverage by one of America's best secondaries we see main concern with him that's where Lorenza want to go with the ball I almost want to do something a little careless you see the pressure when it takes an extra real estate to bring the big fella down Satterfield's 319 pounds at Lorenzen carries him for about five yards looking for somebody to throw the football there's a reason cuz what about the meds true all right back alack had a shank out of bounds in his last punt average at about forty point three yards in the pond and we have a whistle on the play five yard counties in 3d spot Goforth down rock of snark on a snap no harm done there mark you want to move back get the chance for you I had a full wish pack alack who considered the number three punter in the NCAA average forty four and a half yards last year 18 inside the 20 but he's going to try to do here it's a high one and his coverage cannot keep it out of the end zone hey rookie welcome to the NFL follows the lives of six players including Joey Harrington and David cars they embarked on the journey from college to the pros the show documents everything from the anxiety of the draft to the final roster cuts part of the block Tuesday at 8 o'clock Eastern on ESPN for more information you can log on to espn.com beautiful skyline here the view from Papa John's Cardinal Stadium like the spires Churchill Downs just behind us not much of a game they're talking about the rookies we've watched were gone struggle in part that's because of a loss of a couple of rookies particularly beyond branch who last year had 72 catches for over 1,100 yards the second round pick of the Patriots came up big in his NFL preseason debut Sean you and I watched that game they couldn't stop him he's a difference back there and we'll be at that level also who right now we're going wishes he was in a red uniform second and 14 audibly changing the protection blessed out to the left under pressure Oh Gaber goal trying to make something happen here drives a little bit too much brakes out of the pocket and can't hold on to the ball quad Segal with a fumble recovery and that puts the Wildcats in the driver's seat they've said David Bowen has one weakness mark the coaches have and that's that he's too competitive and this may be the case but I want you to look at this push in here forces him out of the pocket know where to throw the far ball great coverage now look at the hit put that helmet on a football nice job loose Kentucky got an opportunity in the red zone now great field position so its first intent for the Wildcats i formation playaction he's the mudflat past out to Ronald Johnson redshirt freshman you always want it back to be a good chipper Dwayne right here at the bottom of your screen nice little chip bought a little time on a shorts threestep drop get the ball on the flat there's Lorenzen told us yesterday he needs the throw of the ball the backs warm on a GUID Pinard is blocking Duane wide I think if I'm jarred I'm gonna have a little talk with my coach about that change that blocky design eye formation Jer doesn't like what he sees and calls a timeout so why guy Morris and Jared Lorenzen talk about it we're going to take a little timeout here but we'll be back UK leading to nothing and nothing this secondary 44 interceptions for the cartons over the last two seasons only Miami has more this defense may have to bail the Cardinals out because we go to the offenses it's horrible second at six that spinner on the left side down to about the 10yard line and brought in a four yards on the blue mark you couple that with not just the interception but the last two seasons they've been second to all the NC 2a and take away yes so you got secondary you've got a great pass rush team and you've got a team that's johnnyonthespot knows how to get the football but Brett Keyes the offensive coordinator Kentucky's office doing a good job of protecting him right now ninetysix takeaways over the last two seasons for this Louisville team alarm law it's amazing ranked 10th in scoring defense a year ago and they've got to come up big here as it's third and two I'll tell you what that's a lot of beef pushing that pile okay I'm not sure if I'm real happy if I'm the center and the coach calls a quarterback sneaking Jerry Lorentz a quarterback the quarterback may be bigger than the center yeah I guess I got a chance of two yards when I got 300 plus pounds a quarterback going through those right down there keeps his head down it's a lot of beasts Robert with you on play finally brings the big fella down we're first on its fourth and I formation it's close its close dinner gets the ball out of the I the pile push forward it looks like he might have a shot yeah I think he does market the thing I like after first contact you saw that big body at 238 pounds get the extra push they needed for the first down and he put on a ton of weight about 15 to 20 pounds which obviously is helping him after initial contact all right take a look at the offensive line here this is Sylvester Miller 65 to 97 and he wasn't even used much legs he stood up but he find a way on wipe to keep him out of the play that's a lot of muscle on muscle a stalemate against Dwayne white is wind that is unrolled in their significance mark dinner being able to fall forward and I the backseat judge put backs on their ability to take initial contact and fall forward and Pender's done that a couple of times today guy Morris said he wanted him to touch the ball 20 to 25 times in this game if they were gonna have a chance to win right now he's got 12 carries for 25 yards so not a lot of big gains but again they're chewing it up they're chewing it up and they're there there's a limit up with an ad the way to those carrots that Louisville defense I'm gonna take a timeout but we're back right after this first half the Cardinals down 10 nothing if Kentucky is driving bowl inside the ten huge series for this part of Defense it's outside the Pinner but touchdown but the best direction eight yards on the touchdown carry nice design by guy Morris in the Wildcat offensive coaches fake a little dive pitch it out wide the pin or we saw him pound and pound and pound at 238 but he's able to beat that Cardinal defense to the end zone and corner a little bit after after the extra point we'll get to see exactly how I did it I love mr. X especially when they've been hitting play side the entire game mark fifth career touchdown for Penner as they try for the extra point bad stamp and Taylor Begley do not get it through that might come back to haunt makes it 16 nothing Kentucky it might have been to Wayne white the clock that tick mark with the key here that might come back to haunt and they need that extra point but the run in from Penner was huge and I love the way the Brent Pease our offensive coordinator designs this play and I've been a key block that's going to give Penner a chance to get the edge watch the block by Boone here gonna come down a little crack sets it up goes and gets force nice job Penner speed gets him outside but I like the way the players design look at this in the flake play side misdirection pitched the outside when you lose contain against a good fast runner you're done they lose contain does Louisville defense and then the extra points blocked and you're right they come back to get him get in there and once again and allamerican Dewayne white is one of the best of the country doing it all including special teams to block that kick there's Penner mark that's a big boy 2:30 in he showed he's got a little some little wheels to get outside 13 carries 33 yards so far so he's on pace to carry the ball 20 25 times in this football game as guy Morris hoped he would and now we've got just under four minutes to play and a chance for Dave were gone and get on the board or halftime for the first down don't take that won't they just a reminder tomorrow night's Al Michaels and John Madden are off but be sure to join keep Jackson and Dan Fouts as they cap off ABC's holiday weekend bash presented by AT&amp;T Wireless the Auburn Tigers take on number 19 USC at 8 o'clock Eastern ABC sports the class of college football hey Mark mark you want me to see if Pete Carroll's got something going on it was a pac10 boy myself you know I can't wait to throw the cringe when I hear that song alright David going out of the shotgun little play I could have been shot this time under pressure makes two guys miss back to the right he's been the only offense he's taken all the hits the offensive numbers that is not offense that's lack of mark 22 plays 31 yards averaging a little over a yard a play that's not good enough and we've talked about the offensive line that certainly they've allowed pressure on reg on but these wide receivers have not done a very good job getting over you must win and they're not winning and they talked about that lack of experience second and seven quick pass inside ain't complaints Victor Glen number 88 cannot hold on to the football and we have a flag on the play might be a late hit on the go yeah and you know mark when you're going so good on defense stay away from the head get the guy and get out of there because your defense is playing so well personal foul roughing the passer on the defense 15yard penalty in previous five automatic first I'll take a look this is him right here now I'm gonna come in you're gonna put a hit on the quarterback do it right balls released stay off if that's way too much time I understand you want to be physical there's a difference to be in physical and being dumb that was dumb ball was dropped he would have had him in a long yardage situation don't give them momentum if here Kentucky's defense careless play first and 10 3:13 remaining known under pressure Spain but the screen man is tackled immediately by Jeremy Cottle number 68 mark what a difference what a difference a play makes same blitz same thing going to come off the top here gonna hit him but now disappear hit boo put a nice lick on him force a throw incomplete pass on a screen nice job cover on the back all the way now that's the way you supposed to play discipline football the goto of 1012 yards in the first half amazing it's a man that everybody concurs around the country it's a bigtime NFL prospect certainly a Heisman hopeful second and 10 throw it down the field the balls on the money perfect coverage and they're saying yes a reception 17 yards on the play gasps jr. Russell with a catch they love jr. Russell's potential take a look at the top of your screen it's just a they're going to dash it we're going to come back at the top the key to this is give you a recorder backspace to the sidelines and finish back at the quarterback ball is thrown low and outside take one more look at this part from the endzone angle nice job by the receiver to protect and give we're going a shot to throw it junior Russell big body two Cardinals that's their fourth first down of the first half 2:40 left on the clock dumping it out to gates is immediately swarmed by Kentucky just about not even a yard on the play we call it no game well mark that concerned that the Tracy talked about at the top about will they be able to wrap up a tackle because they did a lot of thud drills in Kentucky cuz they only have two full practice pads well there you go wrap it up nice job making sure that when you make that first contact that it stays that way second and 10 to 11 left go brings the player in motion flicks makes you miss right over to the flat almost TJ Patterson almost made the tackler miss would have been a big gain if that lot have happened but Derek Tatum hyperextended his knee in training camp it has been a little bit limp comes up and makes the play watch him wrap up now we're going by bad snap alerts the Blitz the unblocked guy gets the ball on the flat take a look rate down make a good tackle hang on was probably within another four or five yards nice tackle by Tatum out there an open space Louisville one of six on third down its third and seven from the shotgun protection this time had a guy wide open number 88 Victor Glen and this time we're going can't get the ball there give them you know what they're all over the tide at Ghent but I think Alberto is telling got chip a sea jet nice and and out coverage on him but what they're saying is I think that we're going wants to receiver to run away he was throwing an end cut receiver was running up to see what goal was telling him I needed him there again mark will talk about the communication not having the veterans that's what he wanted there by Victor Berg went last year in just two receptions for 31 yards now he steps into the hallway he has to play all the time this is the problem we expected he might see from the Cardinals offense he wanted he wanted Victor Glen to run away inside with that open space there and he kept going up the ceiling but that's that's why the under throat so the Cardinals take a timeout face a fourth down we'll be back they're trailing she's teamed it up see Wilson Louisville and Kentucky big play for Louisville right now 1/4 pound rated number 18 in the country find themselves trailing 16 just over a minute to play in the first half bad snap going picks it up plenty of time more time than we've seen again all day he dropped it right into number six Damien Dorsey do they call it in or out they say it's a reception what a great throw and catch urban flowers number 32 delivers the lumber where you know what they this is one of their favorite outs like you watch Dorsey now good a sound on the inside will the post corner swims right by him nice throw to the outside shoulder by Roy Cohn 29 yards pulls it in the ball grounds not going to cause that fumble good job nice pitch and catch I love the fact that John L Smith said hey it's 46 I don't care let's go do it for a BCS type team they've got a foot worried about BCS I make more plays like that Drake it's 29 yards on the reception that sets up the first and 10 just inside the 15 1:11 left on the game clock would go up frozen intercepted though they're saying incomplete outofbounds Antwon Huffman the dime back a redshirt freshman six feet 170 pounds catches the ball but he's out of bounds nice job by Huffman trying to work that little pile on their mark what's a nice bitchin catch over the corner ball a little bit under thrown Huffman you know what I love is I get so many BP he's playing the man instead of the ball mark the ball goes up Huffman takes a look at the ball and plays the ball don't pass interference chance and almost in interceptions it's great teaching skills few kids at home play in the football when it's in the air second and ten it's been a long drive and all of a sudden we haven't seen as much pressure you under the Wildcat offense as an old cast Derek Tatum let's check in at the studio and rhysdavies Lamarck coming up at halftime Virginia Tech gave LSU a big old taste of Beamer ball and some bands got a taste of pepper spray will explain that we'll have Bob Davie Mike Godfrey talk about the end of the game situation with Washington and Michigan and it is the year of the quarterback and what rex grossman really needs Mike's gonna let you in on that we'll see if the half in just a bit all right Reese we're looking forward to it John L Smith looks on before this Drive Louie with 29 yards this Drive 66 big third down with gold escapes the question bounces outside makes a couple people miss bounces off a couple of more finally brought down at the 12 excuse me the 7 yard line today well mark he'll find a way to keep from the ball game won't he what a great athlete for a big man but go back to the pressure again he's been knocked down 10 times that is the 16th hurry two sacks had one turnover there put pressure on him how long can he continue to do this without some protection right now I need to rest his Louisville calls the timeout he's gassed his coach says we're gonna admit he plays the position with a linebacker mentality a lot like a guy that just got inducted into the Hall of Fame Jim Kelly was with the Buffalo Bills he's gonna look down to Gunbarrel he's gonna take into chops he's gonna make the throws that are necessary to win football games and you know white guys like that and Kelly you can have farm to that list what it does is that your players on your football team see that and it becomes contagious you say man alive I got my quarterback out there who's going to be a million dollar man a year from now but he's out there selling out for us and making a commitment to us and you know what I'm not going to slide I'm not going to go down talking where we're going says and I love the mentality but the last thing they need is for him to be too careless to get himself hurt I agree with you the coach said Andrew Cohen admitted he was frustrated with his new offensive line early in spring drills and an in training camp he's learned to get over it and understand that that's what he's got to work with somehow in this drive he's been able to overcome that get out of the pocket make plays and that was that's what makes him a great quarterback mark you're exactly right and and trying to be patient I know it's tough but when you've got four new offensive starters on the line that is the most difficult positions for five guys to gel together it's just a short matter a weeks during training for another one for one on fourth down the converted one to keep this drive alive earlier now it's fourth and three 42 seconds on the clock John L Smith and his quarterback game ago and talked it over line up at the shotgun three wide receivers to the right jonesy motion first down first download them yards on the play typical throw for a lefthander rolling out touch pass especially a tired lefthander that's why he'll get the big bucks mark to be able to go against his body throw it up there nice and a soft touch give his man a chance to catch get to the first down marker takes a big big hit gets out of bounds but now it's the second time of this drive down they've gone for it on fourth down a convertible and tiger jokes on fourth and three I had no receptions last year that's the guy you choose the grouchy we'd go out of timeouts first and goal 12 play the drive though looks doesn't like them see the pressure throws it in the middle of the field almost cockpit incomplete now that's what you can't do if you're de Vougeot and he got away with one there I know he's trying to make a play and he's a oneman wrecking crew right now I know he likes I know he likes jets and this one there at the top of your screen the Titanic jet run to the flat nice coverage cutting underneath tries to come back to him but you know what that's a dangerous play with pressure you almost want to throw it away and read T it you don't want to pull away now they need points down here mark down 1664 dion hoax the redshirt freshman by independent pressure 13th play of the drive 78 yards minutes incomplete out of the end zone they throw it up for number nine Joshua tension basketball player who's got a 40 inch vertical jump they told us they'd be looking for him down in the red zone this is a good spot for him but as you and I both well know never in the history of football is a ball ever been complete what has been caught out of Bounce so it's tough down there they're into the short side of the field and throwing it into the short side of the field got to give yourself a little more room so third and goal no timeouts remaining 25 seconds on the clock play selection Michelle what do you call you know what I I think you gotta move him out of the pocket get the runpass option and give her going a chance to get on the edge and work it that way they've got ends lined up why to safety wide trying to keep him pinned in and it blitz up the middle of goat somehow a poison get smooshed rocket to the end zone touchdown Dave Virgo he doesn't have anything left in the tank he almost throws an interception trying to get the ball to Ronnie gent and comes back and gets gent again for the touchdown two yards on the play we've got ourselves a ball game Man Alive mark you know they got pressure inside another reason why I said move the pocket will they take the pressure inside but what's he you can't hear it over the crowd the penalty is excessive celebration right now I think the Cardinals would take that yeah to celebrate about but it will move the extra point back considerably down well that's just a wonderful individual effort on with Downes Park get a chance to see that here in a second he's singlehandedly on that drive kept a man making plays with his arm and with his feet so Nate Smith will kick the extra point from way back earlier he missed a 52yard field goal try 35 yards out it's good here here you go mark I say move the pocket well they ended up moving the pocket anyway to try to get rid of the Frazier because uh we're going had to buy some time pressure coming inside gent there you see the Titan again going to the flat but in the sign of a good player keep moving keep it cool you a quarterback an opportunity nice throw by a tire Dave we're going on the run there you see the end zone look we're going by the time we don't have a strong arm mark you don't get that play in there no telling you the guy is gasp he had a free Blitzer right in his face somehow managed to make the guy miss in that physical condition and then makes the throw the stick throw keeping the play alive and that again is why he is regarded so highly by NFL scouts around the national team he is ultra competitive and there you see making a play and he is tired well we talked about Lorenzen being tell you what we're going to running around for more than Lorenzen is and his conditioning is going to help him in the third fourth quarter one hopes are one wonders I'm sure John L Smith hopes that that kind of play inspires the rest of this football team especially that young offensive line that somehow we're going is getting it done despite the way they're playing and I'll tell you what if you're an offensive lineman to five guys you turn around see your quarterback doing that you better be ashamed of yourself that he's the one out there working and going the locker room come out at halftime and kick each other in the rear in and give your quarterback a little bit of help because he cannot continue this tempo for four quarters they have got to pick it up and help her go in some way but he keeps his receivers alive and there's why Ronny Jen is the best tied in a conference Lagaan had struggled so poorly with all that pressure on that drive six of the cargoes kickoff that's abdomen receives for Kentucky he's gonna give two about the 20 21 yard line so Dave rag on wills himself despite his being batter in the first half to a touchdown drive by the Louisville Cardinals but I'll tell you what this is benches it's been hard to watch John yet sharehouse bark I could feel it up here are we talking about him being tired though let's not forget the number of times he has to pick himself up and continue to compete he's getting battered and bruised but I assure you when all said and done Dave we're Goins going to be Stan take a look at that now he's been knocked down in the first half 13 times just too many they're gonna kill the puck with gold individual effort has kept them in this game the only reason there haven't been more sacks is somehow he's been able to keep plays alive of Boyd three Blitzers and missed assignments on the offensive line tell you what it's it's been an entertaining first half and now with a Louisville score making it 16 7 Kentucky we do have a game and I think that guy Morris has got to be a little nervous if he if you're the Kentucky Wildcat head coach you bet you would have liked a cup of those blitzes that you went after we're going to get a sack make a punt and go in 16 and nothing little momentum change and I think John L Smith even though they got a little momentum change is going to choose some people at halftime their head football coach and get on his five big guys on the offensive line well I'll tell you what I continue to bring pressure if I'm guy Morris certainly so far their defensive backs have done a wonderful job covering and let's send it down to Tracy Wolfson who's standing by with the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats well coach your defense has been so strong all game just until that last Drive obviously not the way you want to go into half but pretty good score right now huh you know we're gonna go in big late hit on the quarterback doesn't help us at all I think that gave him a little bit momentum so we got to come back well I'll tell you what this is a huge upset in the making the Kentucky Wildcats leading 16 to 7 over number 18 Louisville let's send it to the studio and rece Davis market Louisville trailing Kentucky 16 to 7 Daybreak own say what he deserved the second half rest he has been beaten and battered in this first half somehow picked himself off the ground that managed to get these Cardinal team into the end zone for at least one touch to no mark and I wouldn't be surprised if we went and said okay guys we you know we had our troubles in the first half and Dave get to the offensive line and say you're new we're trying to gel and work together and get this thing going there you see the numbers not alarm not big numbers but that average game per play the one that sticks out right here mark now it's more app it's just horrible passing yards sixtyseven most of that came on the final drive they converted twice on fourth down I think I can hear John L Smith yelling yeah from the locker room at halftime because I'll tell you what it was not a very good performance especially from his offensive line of which they have new starters so we're underway in the second half Kentucky kicking off Bradford Clark takes it about three yards deep and he's out oh how quickly things can change I think Jarnell speech at halftime works that's called responding and that's why their top 20 team right now work they know how to describe it talks about trying to come up big to turn this game around but it's been now the third phase of football the special teams it comes up big the first play in the second half a hundred yard kickoff return to make it 1613 cut it to two points with this excellent point if it's good Nate Smith did you and it's true we've got ourselves a ball game the Cardinals down down by two 14:16 go to the cats it's Louisville's first 100 yard kickoff returns since 1968 and mark he want a guy who hits at north and south of special teams sees the hole no wasted motion great block nice job nobody's touching him to the house little over 100 yards would a great job of not racing the space that he's given have a look see now get down the sidelines get themselves some good blocks that's just flatout speed but that is smart get in north and south and not dancing around on a special teams play great way for Louisville to start these second hands there have been three 100 yard kickoff returns in school history prior to this the last one by Mike Blakely versus great back in November of 1968 and I'm hoarse that somehow has to get his football team back in his game this is the last thing he wanted to see you're not kidding you got a good thing going but now momentum definitely switched you saw the touchdown by Louisville at the end of the first half one great play by Rome and now we see special teams like I said great teams know how to respond and there you see about score two for New York you talk about people who can make great adjustments at halftime Sean right when I have been in enough locker rooms and a half time to football games that the good ones can find ways to adjust and get their football team and that was a quick adjustment it was also Clark's first career touchdown in college that's when he remember a hundred yard kick take on the goal line by acne Kentucky a light return he's bachelor finally turns it back inside players in onthespot 30 yards on the return and I'll tell you what a wonderful wonderful way to start the second half of this football game it's just been so hard to watch David go and be battered but this you can just feel the spirits of this team being uplifted by that kickoff return that'll help that first half tail whipping and I'll tell you what it's amazing how much adrenaline you'll get feeding off the special teams which you never inevitably always come up big in a big game so Wildcats take over first and ten on the 30 Laurentian the dump acids weighed out to the left side pitter who had the big first half 13 yards on the reception mark also says is an extension of the run game little quick swing pass little screen mixed in get into Pinter right now let him get in space around the football he may not look 238 past but that's how big he is runs nice elusive run just an extension of the handoff very safe play lane wide to big defensive end left him on block to speed the ball over his head dinner at 33 rushing yards the first half another carry 14 yards on the game finally Anthony Ford the free safety brings him down and when your free safety is bringing you down you know that you're doing a pretty good job in the running and you know Mike we talked about lose we're going in and a halftime coming on out here and change momentum and now look at Kentucky instead of going into the 10th they've answered inner touches the ball twice on a little swing pass in it and a run there's those 14 rushes and he's almost to pushing that 20 mark they wanted to get to first and 10 dinner back up the middle again and I printed guy Morris the head coach here from not getting away from his game plan he said you know we want a ham or we want a pound if we want to soften up that defense or control the tempo of his game and they managed to do that after the big kickoff and look at harp shield enough Dwayne white the allamerican now white gets in on the tackle but not till there's a four yard game that puts it in second six and harps obviously sizewise outweighed that does a good job of getting in there in battle of ten or three touches in a row mark and that's big for UK there's no reason to panic you're still up by two points set there and use up some clock to four going over there on the sidelines Bobby love you and Scott Lopez the two defensive tackles the ones that they're more than anybody right now look at second and six again this time let's they stopped for a loss let's set it down to Tracy Wolfson well you talk about painter and then wanting to give him more reps this year while he says he wants to rush for 14 contra yards and he says that's not him out of his league and running maxvill Gerald Ford agrees he says that the NFL can't have this guy he is an NFL caliber guy he's bulk top and he shaves his five for 500 place Vincente on the little slide sweetie back inside to Derrick Abney but the Louisville shuts him down only one yard on the play that's a nice job attack them by the Louisville defense and we said that's about number five or six screens mark and I know they wanted to get to double figures did Kentucky screening the ball even though there's not a big game they still give yourself a manageable third down and Louisville one of the best in the nation and there's excuse me we're at fourth down now and the question is do you go for it do you punk no panic probably plan it away so it is fourth down fourth and six nice job on third down by Louisville to force his pump we bring back a leg out on the football field when it touched back previously 44 yards his average 41 to and we have a flag you see the lay up prior to snap delay a gaming offense fiveyard penalty spot go fourth down and you folks at home this punter is that's such a strong leg they've done that twice now they want to move him back so he doesn't have to just pooch it so he can get his foot into this thing the Ray guy watch list at number three putter hands coming into the season and he hits a high one bounce around the 10yard line we're gonna spotted about the nine yard line and that's where Louisville is going to take over possession 36 yards on the punt and a Virgo who just got hammered in the first half will go back out and see what he can do in the second half yeah marketing you see these we don't see any sacks right here in this video we see a lot of hits 9 always gets a couple times but these start to take their toll because what happens is you start to feel like you get it back you got to get the ball out quicker right which disrupts timing you feel like oh my gosh they got it I got to make something happen and it causes problems if the hits take their toll and even though you're an allamerican quarterback you can hurt you not surprising they come out into tight formation and run the football early in this one Lionel gates gets the carry and again it's not very yard it's not surprising they come out and to tights trying to run the football but even if they're gonna pass it that's a good formation because you can give some help now that offensive line and you can pass out if you give you guys a really another offensive lineman with the tight end they could protect it well gold has been locked to the world 13 times in this game that's two meeting in a full game but you know what he's also been hit a bunch more time so they can't take their toll but he is a battler the wide receivers have not done a great job of getting open against man coverage Kentucky lines up again in man coverage and Rowan has to hold weights the post quarter we do have a catch Dontae Spielman the junior college transfer who comes up with a catch out about the 31 yard line marketing of beauty I know we're going to get to this flag here and let the referee make this call we'll get a chance to talk about this we suspect that we're going to get a holy call on Kentucky let's see fine I think the results are playing first again this is the second time now they've gotten Kentucky coroners on the post quarter moon and they're gonna kind of sell it mark and they get back to the court of seller now get back to the floor but look at the nice height on the ball that gives him a chance to adjust to it put a little layer under layers I run to it beautiful route but also a nice pitch until that ball was out of his hand way before Spielman came out of the routes so it's now three wide receivers right shotgun formation gets rid of the ball but we have a flag and it's in the area of a holding call on an offensive lineman that's exactly what we have education but Kim latina the head official here a head referee of a big tent officiating crew Kentucky trying to figure out what they want to do here let's listen to the call personal foul hands in the face on the offense half Lucas is all I know so first I will mark I've been you know critical in the first half edition this offensive line with my other guides it's difficult to get it to a rhythm but you also have to take some responsibility and also a new offensive line coach writer they added a coach to sorry everybody's trying to get in a rhythm occurrence is the only guy who returns it Center but there comes a point time when you got to start to step him say we got to communicate more because they're having a hard time and it's not only for me starters but Jason Spitz and Jason weathers are alternating drives at the right guard position so in since you got five new guys so again not a lot of continuity on the offensive line first and 26 really go down to eat the skinny post to number 18 Spielman he comes up big again and this is close to a first down out over the 40yard line looks to be about 25 yards on the game that time plenty of the time for gold and you can see what he can do you know mark what I like about this is the time and we're going to come down we're going to run a skinny post but watch your cones set up and get the ball out of his hand right when he puts his foot back there set down putting your foot to ground and throw it nice skinny post receiver gives him room inside there before the safety comes over excellent job wild gates with the carry on first and ten it doesn't pick up much no gain on the play and again one of the things that will help Oregon and help this offensive line is start winning on first down we've seen them in a lot of second and Long's third and 20s you know you do that over and over again you're not going to win for the yeah you can put an allpro offensive line in there when you're in third long we don't have a lot of plays in the playbook it's very difficult to block more guys than there is second down and ten Cardinals trailing by two hard count buyer go sweep action cakes picks his way for about five or six get a job on the left side of line mark saying you know it's time we've been been push back all the time and run in the past give ourselves some separation you saw gates who's obviously their best running back in the open few get out there and move it about 5 yards 40 yards 35 505 horse lane on the stop good job that time of the pulling guard Antoine sings number 64 two of nine on third down conversions tonight the Cardinals arm McComb bobbles the shotgun snap can't find anybody scrambles scrambling looking for the first down fix his way through and battles his way like a lowly beggar over the 45 and down to the 44 yard line first down Vargas if you don't know anything about football and you just tuned in to watch and you're watching we're going here and you've seen him in this game how tough this is because you're watching him well the tougher guys you'll see low snap again it's happened three or four times stays with it his head is up the field when he finally decides to commit to the run mark he does big body like that people bounce it off it's a tremendous performance a gutty performance we tune in and most part people around the country probably did to see him throw the ball he hasn't been able to do that but he's found a way to move this football team first and ten over the meadow interception by quintus company but there is a flag on the play we might have a defensive holding here that one got away from we're going a little bit but I think you're right mark hold they're gonna think they got a little hold yep grab and Ronnie champ the tight end over the middle it's hard to believe that we're going would throw a ball in an area like that where you don't see a receiver at all unless he was drugged down by a defender holy on a deep end hold it algebra C except I find the our tenets from the previous couple automatic well you wonder whether or not when you see that whether it's catchable but there we go away she's a Jersey being grabbed right there mark yeah that's Ronnie Riley the inside linebacker on jet there you see it Ravager z that's a good call by the official you know sometimes get the points that can't hold him on can't stop him don't try to hold him Riley smart kid fifth year senior the middle linebacker missed all of last two of that ACL but again beaten he did everything grab the Jersey so its first 210 going Nikki the sideline nice catch by number 88 Victor Glenn good enough for a first down 13 yards on the reception now this way you used to see him if he used to watch a little bill in the past goes up runs that route comes back down the sideline mark good quarterback throws it over there gives this guy a chance but these young receivers are now starting to find a way to work their way back to the quarterback that creates some separation and coverage and I like we're going even though he's had trouble with his wide receivers and they haven't done a good job of getting open he's thrown the ball on time he's trusting you look at this drive three for three 60 yards but first half 8 of 21 67 yards so most of that came on the final drive the touchdown drive just before half playaction bootleg ride this is all run with gold and not go down you're not gonna see this guy hooks why he picks up about three yards on the play you're also not going to see him try to step on that white mark or out of bounds he feels like he he feels like he could take on anybody and I said earlier and I say before he said if he wanted to slide go play baseball he's got an opportunity to go out of bounds his nope my teammates are gonna do it so am I let me compete get you a couple more yards that's Dave for going if you put a bunch of pro scouts are here tonight mark I'm telling you what you see what what a good quarterback is when they're with it when they're not having their best game as an offense Dave were going 37 yards rushing the rest of the team eight this guy can't get it done because of the offensive ID the receivers so he takes it in his own hands and he runs the football second down and eight back to pass massive time that one slips out of his hands he had a wide open Dante Spielman coming across the middle of the field and there is a flag on the play another hole defensively perhaps I think so I think you're gonna get another hold on gent coming across the field a little crossing around step but you know this is what we talked about the receivers having trouble getting open so what do we talk about in half between these two of us one more crossing routes more rubber out to allow these guys to find a way to get a home here you see joke first up the Sun right there in your picture Jeff running good held twice Hajduk with the hold although you get beat inside you and but he's concerned on defense about jet because he's been such a good receiver for this team planted at the tight end it wasn't a catchable pass but they held him earlier than the past and production fell off a little bit last year he caught 34 balls for 330 yards but they wanted to get a lot more out of the tight end position they've done that in years past and he's going to be a bigger part of this offense that's Vincent burns number 98 right defensive end the Wildcats he's being attended on the field a couple holding Kennedy's cup a big place by her gum and return right coming out of the locker room at halftime and Louisville looks a little bit more like the little girl we expected to see even though they still haven't settled wrong all right why they're attending to the plan we'll take a break back after this on the 10yard line first and goal all on the number 28 TJ Patterson picks up a couple mark I know result good we're going sad success getting out and making plays but I know John L Smith and they've got to find a way to get a little more production for the backfield backs and the offensive line gets a push because as the schedule goes on it doesn't get any they at Colorado State that's gonna come up along the way here or to Spain it's not easy to exactly and again you don't mind him getting out of the pocket by design and when he's got a run for his life that's a different matter second and goal down from the shotgun spread formation which is on the gun throws under pressure Paul has tips incomplete Jeremy Cadell with the tip the junior sixfootthree 297 pounds had a pretty good game so far today hey Cordell and the rest of the UK defensive front has been taught well mark if you can't get to the quarterback get some arms up little inside push getting up there there you go play big and make the big fella go over the top of him and he'll if they keep it it out baby comes out high nice job by Cordell tips ball that's time number three in this game has been Tiffany and then I'll have to place the guns first incomplete pass at his drivers wrinkle for 60 yards and this is third and goal from the seven once again delayed up the middle double pumps and just overthrows Damien Dorsey who was coming out the back door was going to be wide open for a touchdown yet he's wide open but I'll tell you this there's Jen also wide open coming underneath there we also had Dorsett the other way but you know what don't blame that on the quarterback of the receiver because claudel made a nasty lick on the goal that forced the high throw and getting coached over there on the sidelines but you know what when you get hit in the mouth that many times it's tough to make every play so Nate Smith comes on the field his first field goal attempt was from 52 yards it was a missed this one from 24 and we have a whistle a timeout by the University of Kentucky Wildcats guy Morris wants to talk it over we're going to take a break we'll be back with a field goal attempt when we return down on a touchdown but missed it here's why sure yeah mark if you pick Jason whether he's near over 300 pounds he can't open up the gate money often silent he steps outside last 68 Cardell to come in and make the hit there's the reason the throws high you can't step outside you got to get a hit on that guy inside you open up the gate let your quarterback get a hit and give away a touchdown to to wide open receivers Kentucky missed an extra point earlier otherwise it'll be 17 this for the lead it'll be their first lead of the night if it's good Nate Smith from 24 yards it's up and it's good Louisville takes their first lead of the from Papa John's Stadium we'll take a break be back with more action right after this painting the crowd as the Cardinals have found their way back on top I appoint 1716 over the University of Kentucky so after a 12play 84 yard he bribed it took five minutes and 38 seconds to put the Cardinals back on top wait wait teach Locka will kick off taking on about the six yard line by arles Beach true freshman running back and weaves his way back through the traffic and finally has brought down about the 40yard line just a reminder tomorrow quarterback Geno gheh Dooley and the Cincinnati Bearcats open their Conference USA schedule as they host Adrian Matthysse and the TCU Horned Frogs College Football on ESPN tomorrow at 4:30 Eastern Time for more information you can log on to espn.com that Gino the Dooleys pretty good to tune in to watch in the mall that'll be fun seems like we're saying big quarterbacks on every team there's one in it yeah they're big but I'll tell you what Jared Lorenzen brings a whole new definition outside defense fiveyard complete go first down I'm very very rarely field warped by a guy I know I'm sorry if I was down there talking to him during warmups he's big man he's big he any six four he's not any taller than you or I but eight for 14 in the first half but again pushing 300 pounds he could be the biggest quarterback ever to play at this level in college football was Laura it was Laurel and Hardy when our standing our two spinner with a catch or the carry excuse me as we take a look at Lorenz ins first half and again you don't see him under center much a screen pass to Ernest Sims but he's lead apart he has another one we began our Nico so he literally watch Bernie play the only reason I say that didn't look like he was do anything but was able to buy time with his feet and he did just that with big fella to move around through the door second and three of his two hundred sixty five to seven pounds time Pinner again with the carry stopped by rod de the inside linebacker number forty a junior who is one of the in fact the only replacement on that Louisville defense for the year ago which is one of the best in America mom you mentioned about painter getting that 25 carry point at 20 to 25 30 touches he's missing out which is going to keep Kentucky in the football game which is why they are we have ten on third down conversions for Kentucky and Lorenzen sticks one in their tights to number three Ernest Sims and that's going to be good for a first down just a good timing safe play although it's a little bit a little hips a little slant wrapped it to the inside guy take a look at this he's gonna stop in zone sit down Lorenz is going to get it out of his hand one two three Sims sits down in zone before the linebacker gets out there first down safe play chain mover on the other half of the football field again we're seeing the resin I have to play now up under the center this is an interesting move by Morris bunch play up the middle to Pinner it's a couple of yards you know what I think the reason for is that mark for that to yard game to pin or is it you know you almost limit yourself in the gun when you're running out limit yourself to some draws and some sweeps here now you get under the center you you've had a little breeze rolling in the stadium and so Laurentiis not losing his breath you got more threat of a bunch of different runs with the zone plays with Lorenzen on the set if you're going to ask him to start throwing a lot from under center you're going to get into a conditioning problem this kid's going to get tired towards the end just when we say that he's in a gun second and eight now three wide receivers plenty of time drives one down to Derrick a B and D the junior 510 175 the best route runner 11 yards on the catch and happy ranks 7th alltime and receptions for the University of Kentucky I love this game he walks him mark there he is the junior wide receiver he walks into our meeting and I feel like I'm look at him kid who would bag your groceries but he's fast he's competitive and he was so excited on Friday to play on this football home day what he is passionate about the game especially about this rivalry out of the shotgun Laurentian changes to protection we go showing some blitz now the defensive backs back in a way steps up and the pressure wide open at the please the number 82 crisper dog the junior college transfer second team allamerican Saddle Brook college 17 yards on the catch and you know what Lorenza does another good job of buying time he's got a great feel for the line of scrimmage there's a nice little pitch sitting out there look at the job by the receiver not to run inside the coverage mark against zone stays out there stays away from trouble but look at Lorenzen step up there by time gonna get a hit still got plenty of zip Neuer the line of scrimmage was that's a nice play by the big fellow first and 10 UK threatening now on the 17 yard line under the center pin and gets the ball bounces it to the right side picks up two or three before he's dropped four yards on the carry rod day on the play the inside linebacker little flag on the play drive killers that I have killer that's what they tell you mark when you're in the red zone and you take yourself back illegal formation on the offense we only have six Niner from the village ham I've got anything the p5 stop you know mark the accountability you talk about six men on the line of scrimmage they need another man up there and although that guy's got to take responsibility the quarterback still has got to take inventory and make sure that he's down his players set and guy Morris has got to be upset an old offensive lineman who played 15 years the NFL and the Philadelphia Eagles what did the Superbowl of the Eagles coach for three years in the National Football League that's just got it even and those are the things he came to tell where you line up and that's just a parsley first in 15 for the Wildcats that was shotgun when he dashed left wrenching off his back foot nobody there in the corner of the endzone either a miscommunication or Loretta has decided to throw it away I'm not so sure the old Jared Lorenzen will throw on that outofbounds mark I like that that's a bit that's a win that is a win by the Kentucky Wildcats because he doesn't throw an interception doesn't do anything stupid and I think it was a good decision by him to make that throw and it's his first incompletion of the second half and you can say well hey listen can in completion but it does it keeps the drive alive you get a chance now another two chances to pick up that 15 yards why there's four downs of the late look got three of them before you have to tick eyes the defense a little flip pass outside avoid the pressure that's r2 spinner we can both catch the ball and run the ball that's good for seven yards they pick up almost half of the 15 they need and Mark that's just a little hot swing they they they they blitz in the linebackers he throws a little swing pass and had talking to the coaches they said last year Lorenzen really have no clue mentally Wright was a physical guy go out there just make the throw there's Brent Pease as offensive coordinator in the second season played quarterback in the National Football League himself but now you could see that that pickup Lorenzen has a clear memory of what's going on in the football for this half the legend yours again 8ball nobody in the vicinity cause incomplete that's gonna bring out the football team like you thought they got held a little bit today you throw it away you'll take these three points puts him back in the lead and remember markets go back now to the blocked extra point by Dewayne white right did that put him up 16 another would have been 17 and they left that one on the table did Kentucky could come back together so Taylor Begley comes on the field to try a 32yard er he's had one attempt tonight good from 41 yards out shoot freshmen nerves of the senior he drills that one through and the Wildcats find themselves up on top again by two 1917 and score with about one minute to play in the third we talked about David Cone but I'll tell you what the University of Louisville has produced some pretty good players including offensive lineman Joe Jacobi a former Cardinal playing with those great Redskins teams and boy did he come around on that counter tray play and that's a 300 pounder get around a big guy who can run was a big part of the Redskins Hawks the big hogs up there winning Super Bowls one of the first 300 pounders to really run let's go down to Tracy Wolfson who has found the big fella Tracy mark talking a big fella he's six seven I look like a midget compared to him right now but Joe let's talk about first his offensive line you know what it's like there are young squad having how hard is it to joke well the hard part is their mix it missing blitzes and stuff like that communication can monthly feather and that's why you're seeing the quarterback take a lot of hits to Mike well let's talk about why you're really here your number was honored today congratulations how does it feel well thank you for the compliment and it's amazing it's just the years of playing to come back and that success we had in the National Football League with the residents and come back here your hometown plate for your hometown school and then they have your Jersey honored like that it's just a great weekend here pop them off would be great to see a win the bike thanks a lot Joe and congratulations thank you all right Tracy thank you very much I'll tell you what a heck of a football player there is no doubt about it one of the real good guys in marquee could we played against Big Joe another time i I mean I wasn't very good but I'll tell you what with Big Joe much in my mind I'll tell you what Dave were going could use Big Joe Jacoby tonight good knee hey even now Big Joe make find a way to get it done alright so the Cardinals and de Vougeot take over from the 20yard line first and ten trailing by two in this game a little over a minute to play in the third and characteristically plenty of time dumps it out TJ Patterson he stopped immediately maybe a half a yard on the play mark the thing that sticks out to me most about Kentucky's defense obviously the pressure but the way they've tackled once again they only practice twice all summer long in full gear so you wonder about the intensity but they're answering the call because they have wrapped up really well tonight and made sure there wasn't a whole lot of yards after the catch guy Morris was concerned about how they might respond was really forced to do that because of the numbers probation he doesn't have as many kids but they have responded very well second day nine going out of the shotgun right in the hands of Ronnie Ghent the tide in uncharacteristic of him to drop a football like that mark that on your calendar because you won't see that very often but the ball gobble him up a little mark he's very good at getting his hands out and catching it he let that thing get into his body and it ate him up a little bit too fast off his passion for the balls coming out that hard you got coverage on and get the hands up and that contains been held tonight so up several times and he's been open and he feels like Shaquille O'Neal later the ball because oppression finally it all works out and he can't catch the 39 trouble father's a stats six yard line sixteen yards on the broken play this guy just doesn't give up you know what you gotta keep it this is a good gun snap but he just drops it who wants to continue to play that his eyes up the field that's why I dropped the ball but he found a way to make it happen I don't know how he described the guy anymore because incredible continues to battle he's made something out of nothing happens a lot he dropped the ball and it was his fault but he makes something happen guys incredible well we're going to take a break as we end the third quarter but we're back with more action Kentucky leading 1917 over Louisville Papa John Stadium the Cardinals trailing Kentucky Wildcats 17 to 19 as we start the fourth and final quarter first and ten from the shotgun free receiver set left go down the middle wide open great play by number two the free safety Quintus gonna be breaks up a potential touchdown the intended receiver Damien Dorsey routes good just kidding right down the seam a little bit too much touch on this one mark you throw that ball down Dorsey just run a straight seam route puts his arm up looking for the ball hung up there a little too long great reaction by the Kentucky secondary if that ball is thrown on a line that is a touchdown for Louisville you won't see what going under throw many of those crumby lays out if he misses that that's six second and ten now under center go finds forcing on the slant route Dorsey says the hardest thing for Dave has been his ability to see me he's only five foot seven inches that's good for 11 yards in a first down now this is the way you play up front everybody steps down slows away the beat Blitz inside by the linebackers high hat on a hat Huff and your partner out gets the nice slant route nice pitch and catch but that's a reason they can get rid of the ball mark even though it's a slant and it's short you should be able to the guys up front the big five up front do a nice job of letting we're going stand back there and throw that didn't even look like the same offensive line on down around the end zone a couple of series ago first and ten from the 48 yard line go back to pass the junior college transfer to get a sense of how strong lagoons arm that thing was a laser yeah it was a little quicker he might have got it a little too far inside but man live it came out nice route by Spillman and the reason you got an opportunity to push this down the field just missed almost made the catch is once again the protection was outstanding that ball right there hits the ground there's no doubt the ball bounced good call by the officials and great adjustment by John L Smith the head coach now they're getting wide receivers open the balls getting out in time here's a run rival gates off the right side it changed things up this looks like the loss of about a yard and mark for as much as we you know criticize that offensive line boy these last two or three plays they've decided to suck it up and get out there and make things happen and realize that we've got to take some accountability and it's given we're going to chance to push that ball down the field Vincent burns who was attended to a little earlier in the game late and the third quarter comes up with a play so he's found a way to get back on the football field the Cardinals face of third and 12 I'll betcha you see pressure mark shotgun three wide receivers and here comes the Blitz he had the time he had open victory plan probably not for the first down but threw it behind him the pressure field behind him now the lines give him a little time to throw and he got a little bit out of sync maybe his little shot that he has this much time to throw Kentucky holds mark that's huge by them it is that'll bring on pitch Logica last kick 19 yard or out of bounds he shakes it he's average for the night just over 33 yards Cardinals need a big kick here play the field position game and it's an end over end into a scrum the ball is loose no decision yet by an official Louisville says they have it this you're looking for some help and I don't see a flag didn't was that two yard halo mark I don't see a flag and it looked like they might have gotten that 2yard halo I still don't see a call either the halo is the space around the receiver has got to have enough room to make the catch without being impeded now it was his own team that seemed to be infringing on that 2yard halo and remember that's a judgment call by those guys down there on the field and he get his two guys at the back there protect him get a little bit too close and we still don't know who recovered the fumble we got some officials making the call and there has not been a flag thrown so they're not talking penalty and I think they're talking recovery jail Smith wants to get involved in the conversation and again not a particularly good kick but it was in Dover in kind of a knuckleball tujaka has not done well tonight at punting the football that one was only 31 yards but you can see right here his old player trying to get out of the way and that ball is loose yeah and his loose there's no question about it mark and those two players you got to have the discipline to know that you've got to give your guy room to catch the football they got too far back into his face made it almost impossible for avenue to make the catch the backup tight end Richard Owens recovered the fumble the ball did not hit the receivers but never touched a Kentucky player before the Cardinals recovered it as we take another look I don't know people see it from this angle okay what if it didn't touch him wow they got away that's a lot of bodies for it does it not from a different angle it does he touches number 35 Travis at well they got away wall touches Travis at well before it is recovered by the Carters unfortunately as we see flags fly here there isn't a review play this is not the National and mark in talking about that the one that hit and hopefully we get a chance to see it again is it when there's four bodies around it normally if the ball is not hit it takes a bounce it goes everywhere the ball would stop dead almost like a pelota golf ball and if we saw the replay hits him right in the belly take a look down at number 36 it's gonna hit him on the left side of your screen 35th it's going to hit him right in the belly comes up another angle you could see it from but hit him in the belly blatantly that was a fumble Kentucky got away Rick benefices in the game they've done a good job mark Jim la patina and his staff matter of fact that might be the first botched call as far as Blake goes that I've seen in the ball game they've done an excellent job of that one they missed it should not be the difference one way or number another in this football game it's a twopoint game right now Kentucky leading by two with just under 13 minutes to play and this will bring up the second and third team for the Wildcats this is must have an illegal procedure call prior to the snap false start take a look here he's going to say if Dwayne White's gonna jump in there and he's gonna jump me from there you go you think you're a little scared of 99 might be but I guess I would be too that's a Antonio Hall jumping a little bit with Dwayne white a lot of guys jump up there's no doubt but say what Jared Lorenzen jumped in his offensive line how critically this drop to deploy here five yard out incomplete lieutenant quit happening will Branson trying to communicate telling those guys up front we saw him he saw him checking around trying to direct traffic and like we said earlier a year ago mentally they said he had no clue right and so he's a little bit more in charge and understands how important the mental side is at that position he told us when we set that limb in the production meeting since you guys drop anything you want to on the board he says I can tell you what it is I can tell you how to break it down how to protect it how to throw it again nine months ago he wouldn't been able to in 18 down conversions for the cats in this ball game the shotgun plenty of time the way to squeeze ninja Tommy forth they said one thing about Tommy Kirk he catches everything the key to the protection is look at the top of your screen you're getting a double by the guard in the tackle Dewayne White gets nowhere close nice big pocket for Lorenzen steps up throws a laser shot and that's a long throw in college football clear across the field nice job by Cooke to use his body to shield the corner gets himself a chance big big first down so a new set of downs set the 46i formation and again back to work in the running game Archie spinner number 20 picks up three arcs and Mark the reason why that's bigger this Louisville defense the last two years has been as dominant as any in NCAA they're in the top three or four in almost every category in past coverage and night they're in scoring defense and interceptions and takeaways but that big third down play can be a backbreaker and what a nice pitch and catch by and Lorenzen and crook that was a long long come back throw spent a long time in the air and was close to being intercept a huge third down conversion second and seven playaction by the defects and there's the difference between Lorenzen and we're going we're going gives himself a little more time he gets the sinai cuts it back in but Jarrett just doesn't have that straight head speed that allows him to get to the side Marcus Jones Bobby the few in on the stop the resident has enough agility to make people miss maybe that omission guy missed but he doesn't have enough to outrun people he's not gonna beat me of you in the 40 but I'll tell you what they see the pressure both these guys under pressure Lorenzen less than we're going but both of them have been knocked down in Lorenza DC nine times poor sacks for the defense third and 10 under pressure back across the middle of the field the official says no incomplete what a throw Lorenzen going to his left stopping throwing back across the field which we'd have been taught all our lives don't ever do don't do it it's one of those yeah it's one of those don't vote oh nice throw nice throw Oh to be young and have a strong arm a little bit of a wobbler gets there from that angle can't tell if you got his arm under it Abbie was adamant about the fact that he did but guess what ref say no they're going to punt 10 minutes to go in this game brent pakka left hip back back is back his last punt 32 yards this one a good one down to and Kentucky is going to take the ball Mike Williams with the recovery what a big play mark I'm not so sure you see Williams is getting blocked but I'm not so sure the returner didn't feel him take his eye off the ball hits him to the chest loses it Williams with enough sense to jump on the ball be in the first man down with it that's why every single play you got a hustle on special tools so Louisville has the ball bounce against them with a bad call on the earlier punt and now this time drop the punt reception and Kentucky takes over with the turnover from the night up two points over the Cardinals dinner every time they get the ball every time they have a big conversion and they moved the chains they turn and hand the ball to our to spinner and I expect him to do this all season long walk in with 238 pounds of bulk and some quick shifty moves I think you can carry him he's showing us why he believes that I said that he's going to be a bigtime runner and pushing that his Tracy said earlier thinks he can get to 1,400 yards a show in a tough SEC conference two picks up the yard on that second and nine power spot left the line of scrimmage eight people in the box back to the flats incomplete mark can't make that throw that was dangerous good thank for a strong arm great coverage but he had to he had him undercut I know Lorenz ins trying to be safe but you got to read it out honestly a lot of times quarterbacks come and premeditate it and throw where they want to at the line of scrimmage without reading it out but that's a dangerous dangerous throw Mike can't pay is the intended receiver Lorenzen 13 of 23 for 195 yards and a touchdown but he's been sacked four times and this is where he's had problems late in football games when he gets tired because of his weight for the mechanics start to fall apart a little bit and he makes bad decision it's least that has been his MO in the past and you know how it goes mark that when you're physically tired you become a mental coward at times we all do the key is to be able to overcome that and try it he says he's in the best shape of his life so maybe that conditioning will pay off for him but this team has also been criticized to ask Kentucky of being a team that cannot close in the fourth quarter they've had chances last year a chance against Tennessee to win football games and they have not been able to close and they got a chance now against the seventh great teeth ranked Louisville in somebody else's house to put a game at least put it close to putting it away so they start to play clock and it stirred and now you talk it over lines up shotgun the way the end zone incomplete that is a smart football player I know it's third down people say we want points but he throws it away throws it up there if somebody gets lucky and catch something you keep your team in field goal range now if they make this it's going to take a touchdown you got to like this since it's a pressure wonderful decision by Lorenzen don't criticize him home good job realizes I'm not taking a sack it would have made it a 48yard field goal instead I'm gonna give my field goal kicker a better chance because now the difference in a touchdown and a field goal so that brings on Taylor Begley he's been good from 41 and 32 this one is from 34 yards out the Wildcats up so the Cardinals dodge of bullets John L Smith dodged a bullet we're going to go to break back after this and the Louisville Cardinals ranked number 18th in the country hosting the University of Kentucky Wildcats cats find themselves on top by to 1917 as Dave were going to the Cardinals take over after a missed field goal in the 20yard line Kristen let's get you caught up for the second half action the car goes trailing 16 to 7 open up the third quarter on the first play with Broderick Clark deep from his own endzone returns into the right side a hundred yard kickoff return ties a school record Dave Virgo which struggled in the first half been hit in the second half 5 of 12 72 yards is fine Wow has found a way whether it's through passing or running to get this football team in the end zone they're trying to change the tempo with the no huddle arm up that ball overthrown that's gonna bring up a third and ten mark I'm sorry Shawn they dodged the bullet again with a Miss field goal they have an opportunity here they don't want to go three and out right and they're going with no huddle it's not one of those quick no Huddle's or hurry up so just trying to change the substitution situation the offensive lines done a much better job first half eighteen where he's mark the second half only three worries so they've come to play here in the second half has knew of those offensive line looks like a different unit doesn't big certainly does well they've got a spread offense here empty backfield shotgun for wide receivers and here comes the Blitz we've gone under pressure that's no place to go number two Quintus come be the free safety right up the middle unblocked unaccounted for in the blocking scheme you know sometimes Marco sometimes on a blitz and kind of time that if you're deep as a guy and hope you hit it without going offsides he does an awesome job look at this they're coming through here coming through here coming here watch come be here coming through boom nobody touches him that's on the quarterback but they've had no chance to even said it speed great timing by the Blitzer sack have changed position here so Illumina now have to kick waited Logica last kick and he's 31 yard or no return remember you had that fumble and this one almost blocked in fact he might have gotten a piece of it it spirals out of bounds at about the 30 7:38 yard line 29 yards on the punt before it goes out of bounds and he has not been reliable Deion Holtz number 64 the redshirt freshman gets the hand on the ball you take another take a look at this freshman getting blocked also mark right here down the middle getting blocked getting blocked but look at that he uses the one free arm to get it up once again Kentucky's done a great job of using their arms look how long it takes him to get this ball off your kicking from your own end zone that ball has got to be gone yep folks didn't allow himself to be blocked great effort so this could change the game around the legend comes right out tries to get the ball into the plaid the ball is incomplete great fortune for Kentucky B they get the kick run back on him on the opening play of the second half but they dodged some bullets here and still find themselves with a twopoint left lead 1917 k mark is the fourth quarters didn't know good to Lorenzen in his most of his career 1220 you see in the first three quarters and he one completion out of six attempts here coming down the stretch of the field breakdown 300 pounds it ain't easy if you're just joining us we're here in Derby City Papa John's Stadium Kentucky versus number 18 Louisville and right now Louisville looks to be shot down by two against the Wildcats who are on probation Mark Malone along with Shawn Salisbury Tracy Wolfson sidelines we talked about special teams the kick return by Louisville the block kick on an extra point by Louisville and the missed field goal by Kentucky we never to leave we've got a good time at attending inevitably special teams seem to always need of their head when he got a big game and it's killed Kentucky tonight all right well Lorenzen takes a timeout discusses it on the sidelines we're going to take a little break but back with more action right after berry as the Wildcats find themselves up by to 1917 over Louisville and this is a very critical third down play shot there's no question about it you know you're going to put into the gun to prevent the sack mark police tried to but it's a good decision if they play man good time to run some pics and get a guy trailing underneath this is third and short five yards or less they're two and four two of four in these situations since the slots got banned coverage he's gonna tuck it in Ron can you bring him down what a load it looks like he's going to be short just over the 30yard line needed to get to the 31 for the first down now mark what he's done there even if they don't get the first down he's at least made the field goal attempt able but that makes any sense you get a chance now and that 46 47 yard range but now Morris faces this PSA I'm trusting my defense we played great let's go in there we're up by 2 let's go in there try to get this on fourth down or do you say give me that victims for touchdown there's the other interesting thing we saw earlier we saw the wrench and on a quarterback sneak when it was short yards when you got a 300pound quarterback it's nothing pen option to go ahead and call the sneak and go ahead and get this guy falling forward and I could assure you the 11 guys on offense in the offensive land we got to go for it we got to go for it this is one of those saves it's a it almost build your your confidence for the rest of the season saying this is what we do they're going to be about a football shy mark and now it's and I'll tell you why you've got a freshman kicker we just missed his last field goal attempt I'm right here given the Bekaa coming off into a ninth season you're on probation you're hoping that your appeal for a bowl ban will come through in November for you I say you go I do you've got a big guy our two spinner and if you want to get from the quarterback do that you know you risked it in a 47yard field goal I know that if you'll go get sent by touchdown show your teeth and guts let's go after a parent award tonight quarterback speak to me and that's exactly what dick gonna push the pile forward it looked like they stopped him initially but I think he got enough for the first down yep and that's the time with guy Morris's I'm so glad I threw out the scales because I got some pushing the big man using that backside in those legs and that extra push got it mark that's a first down nice gutsy calling those guys up with her this just builds that camaraderie and confidence for your office of mine throughout the rest of the scene is saying I believe in you guys let's see there was a refrigerator Perry at the National Football League what are we gonna call this guy icebox man full of food to take a look at that pushing pushing away getting it in there a lot of beef I like the second effort that is a first down just a warning there to the Kentucky sideline no penalty on the play John L Smith meant coach the card those looks on looking for his defense to come up big fresh set of downs eight yard line scream captioned by the Cardinals again this football team has not been able to come up with a big turnover on defense and we have a flag on the play Michael Brown was the man who almost came up with a pig and that's exactly what the Cardinals needed in this situation unsportsmanlike conduct on the Cardinals this is gonna hurt play whipped over dead ball unsportsmanlike conduct on a defense well tickytack there yeah and aside from the unsportsmanlike conduct call when you go back to Lawrence's decisions we talked about his inability to want to fill the check in a placemark he's done a good job with this game that one could have cost him now they got the penalty it would have been a race but you got to be careful and throwing balls and you think you could stick in when he can't but that is a huge penalty five straight in completions for Lorenzen who has had trouble with his stamina in the fourth only one of his last eight balls has he completed this the little died play up the middle work so were well early on that's Ronald Johnson number forty one with the carry there is the offensive coordinator Brent Pease first thing he's thinking as we must come away with points mark we need it because if we can get a field goal now they have to score a touchdown but if we can come away with the touchdown the way our defensive play I expect Brent piece to still be a little bit aggressive you got this why not challenge this out here mark when he got man throw fade route to this kid we rented instead pitches rights to Penner bangs is way up to about the 10 yard line this short of the 10 that's a quarterback talking market on this man I like may help a chance I'm looking at the same formation with you Sean and I believe the same thing you got a guy sitting out on the island out there you got a bigtime quarterback with a bigtime arm and a guy like Abney we let the team in receptions a year ago who you trust who you know will make a play for you and won't allow the others no doubt and if your breath geez there's coach guy in los the brett keys calls the plays you offensive coordinator you know what don't be too conservative she's gonna run left you know what don't be afraid to take your chances will be smart about third and seven the pitch perhaps Bennett banging away inside the 10 but it's not going to be enough for the first down there's this nobrainer you have to kick down mark you got to get that signal five point lead you give yourself a chance to hold it to trust your defense you cannot go for this you have knocked considerable time off the clock and the clock continues to tick it 444 and Counting and you can bet that guy Morris is going to take as much time as he possibly can Kentucky finally taking the time out here it looks like and you know mark you think on the on that last play I was talking about running to your left to get in the center but with the field goal kicker the left footer must love it on the right hash because of the old draw that goes left to right they probably wanted him to get on this house because that's where he likes to kick from instead of the center well he's 2 for 3 he's good on a 41 mr. 34 this from 26 yards Flagg I'll tell you what you'll work and work down the path of starting this man you're working work to get down there you get a couple of things that go your way you knock some time off the clock you get down there where you feel real comfortable for your ticker and then you allow something stupid like that then no doubt about it at least on that game Michigan and Washington with the Michigan take your answer after missing one good opportunity for Kentucky to do the same today Kentucky 11 penalty sign for 79 yards this one from 30 yards out and it's good 31 officially the field goal for Taylor Begley and that Flint's the Wildcats up 20 to 17 forcing the Cardinals to have to score a touchdown with a little more than four minutes left in the fourth quarter we're going to take some time here but we'll come back with the remaining minutes of this football game Louisville trailing the Wildcats 20 to 17 and what has been a shocker just over three minutes left in the fourth quarter danger ago the Heisman hopeful will now try to lead the Cardinals on a gamewinning drive Kentucky kicking off back to recede Broderick Clark who had a hundred yard kick off the turf earlier in the game and he roofs down to the 25yard line and set it down in Tracy Wolfson yeah guys these next four minutes are huge for Dave are gone and his Heisman campaign this school is hoping that they could come away with a win because they produce 5,000 of these bobbleheads look win the facial hair and all but only 500 of these are actually going to be sold so if you can get your hands on one of these and they win this game could be worth a lot of money someday that's right Tracy the rest of those bobbleheads went to major media outlets around the country rut gone he's done everything he can possibly do the offensive line has not been good the wide receivers have not always gotten open but they start the drive from the 25 first and ten under pressure again escapes out of the pocket is hit and down at about the 27 yard line but there looks to be a flag on the play I want to know how you can hold if you didn't hit that well you think there'd be no pressure if you're getting you held huh it's interesting mark you know he sees we saw the numbers 13 or 34 undergoing but don't be in this limp and a lot of family in the previous five a lot of times what happens is great quarterbacks find a way to win when their statistics aren't good you don't care about it you know those guys that you go seven out of 21 and make the play when it matters lagoon's obviously got that capability so while Huysmans about statistics you got to look deeper than that and say what the guys been dealing with all night and still managing to keep his team in a game when they needed the touchdown before the end of the half he was gassed he found a way to run the ball get out of trouble make the pass but he had to in score and they need to have him come up big now here than depression skates way Mervin flowers comes up with the ball but the flag is coming from deep in the secondary and this could be against Kentucky pass interference defense spell automatic first down the penalty on number 27 Leonard Buress let's take another look at this thing mark there's a holding right there you see him grab his jersey he doesn't right in front of the official that's a good call that is a very good call and the hit Dave are going to he got sandwich take a look at this real quick mark front and back boom you're not supposed to get up from those hits that's a tough quarterback he has been Braveheart tonight scramble left in the back side pressure again as he throws and the go is down ball is incomplete and snow to get up Jeremy Connell with a hit number 68 who's had a big night from the right defensive tackle spot and he know both sides here are playing hard but look at coddles effort to the quarterback he's number 68 and the pressure coming from the backside but you know what mark eventually is an offensive line and they've done a better job in the second half 23rd knocked down he's been to the ground 23 times in the game it comes a point in time as an offensive lineman enough s'en of this sense of pride that says you know I can't get my guy killed and that's two plays in a row I don't know how he survived him he's gassed again number 15 325 left in this game from the shotgun under pressure throws the screen but the fact that's caught up to the line lyonell gates can't get to the football and again that was a poorly conceived play they read the screen well there's a ton of confusion here at the top of the field take a look got a receiver coming inside been a muddy the water with the screen too many bodies over there and linemen in the way of the throw to run so we thought yeah yeah and there was Caudill was on pressure again mark six straight incompletions now for the go 3:20 left third and 10 snap throws it down the field it's tipped and intercepted Mike Williams the outside safety picks on ball would go hammered again when he was throwing the ball by Dwayne Robertson and mark gets a case of an allamerican candidate the Heisman Trophy candidate who's been doing everything for him all night going to the well once there you see him a little bit tired and upset on the sidelines there's first of all horrible snap for about the sixth time out of the gun tonight we're going keeps it alive trying to direct ball comes out a little bit high and when the balls tip eventually things like that are going to happen mark trying to make a play but this looms is one of the great upsets early on Kentucky's defense looks like a team who's the top five defense don't they pressure all night yet they were one of the worst an answer to a last year people were looking ahead to September 26 with Florida State rolled in here to see whether or not this number 18 ranked Cardinal team was for real but they don't look like they're gonna get past Kentucky here a team two and nine and a team that with a win tonight will make their entire season it looks like guy Morris is headed in the right direction with his brother mark and we all have that three or four minute drill now with 250 years left to go to be able to control the ball and not let we're going who's a great player get another shot at this you've got to get a couple of first downs remember Louisville's coach John L Smith told us his team could not practice well in the fall and it showed tonight picked up 5.5 yards on first down five picks up a couple of more it's close to the first down marker and it looks like we have a timeout clock is stopped with 221 left mark you made the point you've stressed the point the Kentucky said we got to get him to ball 25 times that is running back Penner I think he's at 26 carries got a fivepoint lead Man Alive it's amazing how these things work out 10 or 26 cares I think he's at about 83 yards mark and there it is 83 83 and a touchdown so far in this game she hit hardnosed three timeouts remaining and they did not take the timeout they must have stopped the clock to spot the ball but it's not a first down it's third and inches the clock is running now buck 47 and again quarterback speak Jared Lorenzo Lorenzen and this UK football team have been dominated a record crowd of and 60 Kentucky fans that witness one of the big upsets early on in college football protect that football what they're going to tell them on the sidelines mark we have an injury on the field we're going to take a timeout when we come back we'll conclude University of Louisville and in the wild two minutes left that's Bobby Leffew the defensive tackle the sophomore it's being helped off the field with a lake injury and the crowd here has been silenced as Jared Lorenzen and the UK Wildcats are on the verge of pulling up a huge upset here over number 18 Louisville all right Louisville's going to take a timeout so let's go back and look at the critical third and inches dirt in one look at this case there's a line of scrimmage mark they're going to get to their that's called push by your guys up front nice push dominant got a quarterback he's helping out he's as big as those linemen but that's when it comes to the critical time when you're inside of two minutes have to get some push and not give we're going another shot at it there's your first down and there's Luke well we're down to two timeouts left for Louisville so you just got to be safe and they're gonna tell Penner to hold on to the football because it's carried at 26 times and he's been outstanding tonight check out the total yards because the total yards amazing Kentucky 270 total yards Louisville with Dave Reagan in this great offense a hundred and eighty nine yards the offensive line has been Forrest at best mcgoon has taken a beating they haven't been able to put together a running game in fact we're gonna is the leading rusher and leading passer for the Cardinals tonight so the play clock now takes it about 15 seconds there's a minute 43 left first and 10 they handed off the Archie spinner and we get a quick timeout by the cards on the game amazingly enough you solve us what the hundred and eighty seven yards Kentucky's defense has given up tonight last year they were 109 total defense an ANSI to eight and they told us in the meeting for they were embarrassed by that and so they've stepped out here all talk Lorenz in in Penner the defense has done an awesome job the pressure they put on tonight has been unbelievable it really has and again we can't reiterate to you out there how big a win this is with the University of Kentucky not only for their football team in their program but for head coach guy Morris who was trying to pick up the pieces after how mummy left in this football team of this program went on probation and there's no question his hand at the hand he said the cupboards been fair I mean he's had to make this happen with a lot a lot less guys during training camp and on the other side of the ball when you look at Louisville this is a football team they wanted to break that bcs party because they felt real good but as coach smith warned us were not that good a football team and they got to go back to the drawing board again you look for they've got colorado state still the comp florida state as we mentioned on september 26 but the big comp was getting old Kentucky again you've got a lot of young players Donald Smith who's had a wonderful career and turned programs around done a great job and five years here just wanted to get through this first game and you look at the schedule not it is a pretty good football team not easily won't be easy you a Cincinnati Southern Miss I mean not to mention Colorado State Florida State as we mentioned so again they're gonna lick their wounds after this one try to get this up we can probably say to that Ford a Virgo whose Heisman hopes were probably over after this painful after you watch her left which did yesterday you might be right mark but he gave a great effort statistics misleading his effort was fatal handily kept him in a game it was a Heisman Trophy effort there's no doubt about that but he didn't get much help we're gonna take a timeout we'll be back with the conclusion of this football game the Wildcats lead Louisville 22 I sit there and look at it and they're conservative part of me says I'll run it twice or pooch it or do stuff that or kill it but you know what a field goal here after a nice big field goal by the Kentucky last time I might keep the furor because then you put the game completely out of reach I know you're worried about a block and gotta take that in consideration but he's trusted his players has gotten worse I kick it if I don't get the first down we'll find out here if they have to make that decision on 3rd and 5 Lorenzen on the naked step on to defender he's got some room finally slides wisely before going out of bounds that's a good play by a quarterback there to keep the clock running minute 1817 and ticking away here and again I don't think you kick the field and a night they might just punt this ball mark just a little tap punt make them go away u.s. defenses play the way the offensive line of Louisville has played I put the game in the hands of my defense I get after Dave we're going he's been gas in the second and you know mark that's a great point plus this now maybe you take the penalty back it up five yards and give your punter a little more pooch room try to knock it out of bounds and make them go to the 80 or 90 yards it takes with that sack right there I think it's a good idea don't go don't kick it now be in effect it becomes almost a 50yard kick you don't want to do that John L Smith watches that precious time tick off the clock is UK now takes a timeout and we're going to take a quick break here this game is not over will it be an upset shocked UK Louisville we come back lucky in number 18 Louisville trailing the University of Kentucky Wildcats Mark Malone Shawn Salisbury and Tracy Wolfson just to remind of the Mac Tools US Nationals coming up next year right here on espn2 guy Morris got to make a decision fourth and a 44 seconds on the clock you kicked the field goal via pewds punted you just go ahead and try to run the football they've had some time to talk about it personally I think you do a little quick kick here get it off try to put them deep in their own territory make the drive the length of the field with under a minute to play yeah and it looks to me like Mark they're going to get up and go to the gun and there you go maybe they just sweep Lorenzen I don't know this is a I'd be surprised if they put it in the other foot cage kick out of the regular formation with nobody back good call by guy Morris the ball down inside the 10 with 37 seconds left it is football and you know what there is a flag down but I like the couch kick and you know what get him back there let him do it and obviously turned out better than a punycode too much more flexibility and more athleticism and I think maybe we give him credit for question be the gunslinger he loves to throw it any can throw we've got a UK player down on the field you have to see the number people at home and wonder why don't you kick a field but it becomes a 51yard you know before that before we Lorenz it gets slides before he goes out of bounds it's 47 maybe you consider but a 51yard you don't do that wise play you made a good call after a play like the time personal lady's heart that idea number 11 who is up and moving around but has a little sign for Louisville and here it is right here the penalty as they watched the ball ARP goes in there except the ball slides out of bounds and there you can see the body flying and again that's just losing your composure upset this is a shocking loss or what looks to be a shocking loss for Louisville and then that was cheap oh absolutely but the bottom line is they take over on down sit about the 3 yard line 37 seconds left I'll tell you what a day bruh going to drive the length of the field this guy deserves to be the Heisman Trophy at least after week 1 huh incomplete under pressure 31 seconds remaining no timeouts remaining for John L Smith and the Cardinals they need a miracle here and if you're Kentucky if they throw the ball up with one of those Hail Mary types no pass interference play the ball you don't want to give them a shot at midfield to go into the end zone yeah but right now you need to get to that midfield no chance give yourself a shot at the end zone or down near the end zone shotgun formation we're going in the end zone three wives to the left somehow escapes still on his speed and makes his way out to the nine yard line but again no time outs clock is running 1817 this is all but over for Louisville that guy's some kind of battle when the plan is dr. clock this game is over three two they do get the snap off wait a second we've got a whistle I thought there was still a second on the clock when I saw the flag come in believe the officials were concerned about Rico and whether or not he was a target seem to hurt but he's been a target all night he sure has long there will be no early wakeup call for him in the morning zero completions in his last eight attempts put two seconds on the clock two seconds on the clock marking the Louvre is gonna lose this game and their own statistics weren't very good you know what he showed me he took it his toughness
