============================================================

the familiar skyline of the city of Philadelphia on what locals would call an absolutely balmy day 39 degrees little or no wind and the symbol of our nation's freedom the Liberty Bell of course located here in Philadelphia but today it'll be the Detroit Lions coming into play at the Philadelphia Eagles as the crowd here at veteran's stadium settles in for what we feel will be a very appealing matchup Detroit against Philadelphia Philadelphia to use the the phrase of the 90s I guess perhaps the most over achieving team in the National Football League the season against the hottest team in the league in Detroit and Anderson to kickoff he bounces a ground ball inside the 20 rivers at the 18yard line and battery Sanders backup running back rivers takes it back out to the 33 yard line Gary Anderson as he approached the ball slipped on turf that is not that moist but down he goes bigtime slip he went down Scott Mitchell terrific numbers 32 touchdowns only 12 picks this season the great Sanders in the backfield the rookie tight end is slow more Perriman and Morton are the three wideouts moment which is anchored by longest crown on the left side that is swarmed in motion when the 33yard Barry Sanders breaks a tackle in the backfield swings to the outside a small one second down and eight the guys up front for Detroit Lomas brown will go to the Pro Bowl again Mike Compton had left guard Kevin Glover in his 11th year goes to the Pro Bowl for the first time Lutz and Moss rounded out it is second down and eight for Detroit at the 35 yard line all three receivers are on the lights looks that way he breaks two tackles and picks up a first now and Philadelphia defensively they couldn't get Sanders in the backfield they couldn't take care of Perriman Rhodes those some early barking and here's the four three that filled he plays with fuller Harmon diction in the rookie Mamula upfront Romanowski Gouveia and William Thomas who had seven interceptions decision the linebackers McMillan at five seven and Taylor at six three the coroner's verdict and Jackson to the safeties Taylor will be locked on more most of the day McMillan the 47 yard line Tilikum fake hit for pyramid and he can't make the that's the other matchup we'll be watching and be Macmillan who is 57 he'll be locked up with param and most of the day at five nine and now you mentioned Bobby Taylor will be locked up with Herman Moore the great receiver for the Detroit Lions with his NFL record hundred twenty three receptions this year because Taylor is six three and as you see Macmillan he's short five seven but he is some kind of a leaper got a hand in there and caused the drop second and ten nickel alignment defensively for chillin shorts on and overthrows and a third down and ten good penetration there by Ronnie Dixon and and I think we're going to see a lot of different things from Philadelphia defensively they're going to have to be upsetting disruptive today sex defensive backs in the alignment for Philadelphia back in 234 the number one draft choice from Boston College and they go right to work on the side of the line anchored by Lomas brown and they got what they wanted pressure in a second Mitch 10yard sac on fourth and 20 carpenter and he takes it from the 22 back to the 28 Sun going down in Philadelphia let's take a look at the Eagles offensively the old lion Rodney Peete at quarterback Ricky Watters and James Saxon in the backfield Barnett and Williams are the wide outs and Edie West the longtime Packer the tight end Brooks is a rookie with McIntyre McKenzie boatswain and Davis Barrett Brooks a rookie out of Kansas State on the left side Rodney Peete leads him to the line with it first and 10 up at the 28 yard line back to cut it back and picks up two waters was held to about a yard for Kerry last week at Chicago Spielman made the tackle here's the four three Ellis is their number one draft choice out of Utah the rookie Thomas the former Viking porche and sprog ins round out the front for Hayworth Spielman and Johnson and the secondary has gotten a lot better recently McNeill and Raymond at the corners blades and Lily clay who had heat interceptions this season at safety Charlie Gardner is in the backfield for Philadelphia spelling waters on second down and eight he stays in the block and he throws and the catch is made up at the 38 yard line by the tight end West and that is close to a first down let's get a report from Lynn Swann now we've already seen a couple of people slip on this field let me tell you why from about the hash mark back towards the near side the ego's bench is always in the shade it did not dry out like the far side of the field there was two inches of ice on this field they put the fertilizer substance on it to dice it and the ground crew did a great job of putting it off but when you pick up when you touch it with your hand it feels a little oily as if there is an oily surface on it now you've a lot of slippin on this side of the field that's what you get when you put fertilizer on astroturf third down and one and the pass intended for Barnett is incomplete Rob carpenter also in the area fourth down and they're forced to cook and I can tell you one thing the Wayne fonts and his team did they went back into their locker room and sanded the bottom of their shoes you can see that ball just floated a little bit on Rodney Peete it fluttered out of his hand and took off but they were back in their locker room with a belt sander roughing up the edges on their rubber cleats to give them better traction talking about the Lions Tom Hutton with a kick and it is fair caught at the 20yard line by Brett Perriman the Lions against the Eagles the winner of this game you know a likelihood would go to Dallas and as much as Green Bay as a heavy favorite to beat Atlanta however if Atlanta wins that game tomorrow they would go to Dallas and the winner of this game would go to San Francisco first down Detroit in the courtyard little girls and it's not down by Bobby Taylor rookie who normally plays on the other side of the field but because of the height matchup today flips makes the play good play he did a good job against Michael Irvin a couple of weeks ago so they decided that lock up Taylor with the size of six three against the six foot three Herman Moore and a good leaping deflection by the rookie from motor den who sat on that pattern like he knew what was coming that was beautifully played by second down and ten Barry Sanders he gets through the 21 and the harmon makes the tackle third and nine for foxes lions railroads the coach of the year he goes for their tenants sick smart great job by the secondary William fuller finally tackles them but it's in effect not a sack but it's a coverage play as the secondary did its job Mitchell had nowhere to go and down he goes in the fun mark millon all over Pat Merriman and he will be locked up with him today and that was exactly where scott mitchell was looking looking for Perriman for first down yardage and good coverage by McMillan more coils to punt for the second time good kick 47 yards taken by carpenter and he brings it back to the 37 yard line the Lions and the Eagles are scoreless we played four minutes 20 seconds in Philadelphia in the late afternoon Rodney Peete the first quarterback in 15 years to start a four season game against his former team ten Stabler started one in eighty as an oiler and the catch is made by the Stephanie's abounds up at the 50 quarry Raymond with the tackle for Raymond giving Calvin Williams a lot of area to hook up he must have Clinton playing six or seven yards off Calvin Williams obviously in single coverage and a good read by quarterback Rodney Peete but notice the pattern it's as simple as it possibly could be you're not going to see Rodney Peete taking a lot of chances sewing the ball or I don't think you're going to see Calvin Williams with a bad ankle do a lot of cutting early in this ballgame Calvin is just trying to make it through this thing Williams time can be limited christine jones and that class is off the hand a fred barnett there are other wideout barnett and Williams coming together in 1990 in the draft with Fred's had an off year where Rodney gets in trouble as in the middle of the field this guy has almost a twotoone touchdown interception ratio in the opposite direction he comes into this game with only eight touchdown passes in 14 interceptions of where he gets in trouble is he'll throw it up in the middle of the field and of course there's the three Million Dollar Man on the sidelines Randle fathertobe waters takes the ball to the 47 yard line it's been a huge story in Philadelphia Rainville Cunningham's wife is pregnant the due date is tomorrow but Randall has said and he's been saying it for several days if word comes that she's in labor he's out of here he's going to the airport third down and five good blocking up thought and the taxes the whole push came up the middle and the Eagles did the job to protect them first down asmath Barnett has struggled with this year the pass over the middle he had seventy eight receptions a year ago Ray Rose brought a new offense in throwing underneath across the middle and Barnett has struggled with that but he makes a big first down catch here nine minutes left in the opening quarter and no score first and ten from the 38 yard line we scored three touchdowns and last year's Super Bowl as a 49ers tackle by Mike Johnson a little skirmish breaks out Barrett Brooks and Tracy Scroggins do some pumping and when you're a rookie like Brooks that's the toughest thing to get used to it's blocking a smaller guy boots quick he'd much rather have a guy trying to run over secondhand feat when the floor receiver set drops it off a Ricky Watters underneath he's tackled by Spielman who's played the entire season with a chest muscle of pectoral muscle it's given him a tremendous amount of trouble than has limited the movement in his arm that's what the Eagles have to continue to do get the ball in the hands of Ricky Watters he was a 1200 yard rusher for them he had over 60 receptions main reason offensively the Eagles are even here today here's this matchup between Brooks and Scroggins he's going to press Brooks back and look at him slide and again it was between the hash mark and the sidelines as Lynn Swann was telling you about him boy a good illustration there how slippery it is third down and five with Martin balance it was deflected by Spielman and then almost intercepted by Johnson it'll be fourth down and if you're thinking about a Gary Anderson attempt it would be about 50 yards they will not attempt the 50 yard field goal instead it will be Tom Hutton lining up to punt rookie out of Tennessee anything that's if it's not inside the 15yard line this is going to be a major discipline he's checked 13 touchbacks they seized and that was the mole first time he leaves it inside the five due to floated it Jerome Henderson was there to catch it and that ends the Lyons deep in Detroit territory the beauty territory berries takes a knife to the four yard line berry finished second this season in rushing image Smith won the title and Sanders second with an even fifteen hundred yards it's a dangerous guy to have carrying the football too close to the goal line you know Barry's a big play guy he had more big runs than anybody in the league this year but he also had more runs losing yardage than anybody inside your own 5yard line that's a that's a concern I'd still give it to him my authority puppet play second on 10 from the floor which of the short drop and close to scars entities will mark macmillan as he gets it up to about the 8 yard line setting up a third down 5:45 the Eagles was 6 dB the catch made by more he got position inside Taylor and Mitchell was right there to gun and into the numbers first time at the sixteen perfectly thrown ball to Herman Moore who Scott Mitchell and we watch Scott Mitchell really grow up in the third game right after the third game against the 49ers when he nearly came of age they shortened up their offense three wideouts and this is good coverage by Bobby Taylor that ball is so perfectly we're only Herman Moore could handle it make the Sanders and then of Herman and the first big break of the game goes to the eagle the first poorly thrown ball by Scott Mitchell and it was poorly thrown he was not pressured he just threw it high Pearman who only goes about five nine couldn't get to it off his fingertips into the arms of Macmillan and what a job Macmillan did of keeping the ball off the ground there's the high throw and yes it's high but look at the job mark does of getting underneath that ball and keeping it from hitting the turf but that's a relatively routine reception beautiful job by Macmillan oh of fighting and digging the ball and keeping it from touching this carpet be from the 14 in there we believe for the touchdown yeah no signal but clearly in just are lining up for the conversion I assume this an official six well talk about being opportunistic there goes Garner and that's that's a touchdown he's inside the pylon by a good yard or two its turnover Johnson six seven fifteen yard for Garner Anderson to the point after Harriman's deflection and subsequent interception comes back to haunt Charlie Gardner scoring the first touchdown of the day after the interception Scott Mitchell and it reflect off the hands of Perriman into mark McMillen's arms because of the wet turf here that's Ricky Watters his traction is critical appropriately named as Anderson's tech take by rivers back to the 22 yard line and then gets forced all the way back to the five of course the board progress to the 22 but that is how stoked the Eagles are to drive them back 17 yards on the run back Danny Smith the special teams coach what stoked is the word to Al and this team reflects their head coach Ray Rhodes I think would have liked to have gone to center field not a fistfight with Wayne Fox to kick this game off he is one tough cookie he's not a real smiling man first attempt on the 20 when that's padded and the lion come up with that one Daniel Stubbs fortyniner that railroads knew and he was there traveled around went to Dallas and then Cincinnati and then one of the unlikely ones and railroads decided he wanted him in he brought in a lot of new players well one of the things Eagles have worked on is the fact that Mitchell throws the ball sidearm and so they're they're more concerned with blocking the ball they've practiced all week long on sensing when he's going to release it and trying to knock it down it's at sidearm delivery he's tall but he brings the ball down years typical Barry 20 of the line of scrimmage and the next thing you know it's a gain of about seven shortage makes the tackle we talked about Barry and the many times that he has lost yardage of course leading the league in big plays one of the reasons the single setback has no lead man in front of him and they take him back a lot to the weak side that's why he loses a lot of yardage but he breaks so many tackles and just when you think you've seen everything from Barry Sanders he does something even more incredible last season he was stymied in that the factor win on third and along turrets Furman more making the catch and a first down for Detroit tackled by Bobby Taylor up at the 36 yard line four minutes to go on the period Philadelphia gambling again Bobby Taylor all alone locked up with her momentum or no help deep and a quick read by Scott Mitchell and of course Herman Moore and they go right to more this is a good coordination between Mitchell and Herman more once they saw that single coverage right to him 36 yard line Plus now case closed on the lawn field david sloan the rookie tight end out of New Mexico tackled by William Thomas and another first down Wow great information on the part of Scott Mitchell that task was supposed to go to the right good coverage there he's not a speedy type rollout quarterback but he got out there looked downfield stayed alive and got the ball to the rookie from New Mexico he does have one advantage in rolling to the left and that he is lefthanded he doesn't have to come back very alert by Mitchell 37 yard line play is over as the ground caused the fumble Brett Perriman makes the catch and Perriman slow him getting back up Jackson and Gouveia converged on the hit there's opry Matthews over on the sidelines warming up he'll be the next in line Johnny Morton their number one draft choice of last year is we'll have to fill a more prominent role than the former giant in there on the tackle and inadvertently lands on the ankle Perriman and they're going to have to wheel Brett Perriman off the field I'm sure pyramids on his way in to the locker room to get xrays and again it's a it's a shame when you work all year to get into the playoffs and then so early in the ballgame you're on your way in to have have something looked at we can only hope that it works out for the best he's tough to he's he the real chatter in the huddle he's a very he's a very inspirational type player he'll be missed his 180 seconds you'd be missed enough huddle it's time for other people for Detroit to step up that's what has to happen when somebody goes down it is second and one now in the 37 yard 2:25 to go especially and works is way for a first down got by sortition I would have to think that Barry will perhaps play a little bit larger role and Detroit might have anticipated coming into the game now Frank we're landing up you're not supposed to be able to do that aren't you can I used to do that for a living I'm not saying that we did it in black and white years ago but I mean I just love to watch him die Frankel he stuffed in the middle and he cuts around the corner so easily go contain leaving seven to nothing David Shore makes the catch and the tight end has a touchdown Wayne Fonts can opt out david sloan enough keep in mind this kid is a rookie a thirdround draft choice and wayne font says mark my words as the years roll along this guy is going to become the best tight end in the national football league and he beat a safety not a linebacker ordinarily a rookie tight end would be covered at the linebacker as you use your defensive backs to do double coverage particularly against the Detroit team that they went with Michaels Ortiz Zorn each was beaten completely to the outside took a little head fake to the inside and a beautifully thrown ball also that man is sixsix 254 pounds with the speed to go D dancing for the point after and he just does boot it through Sloane scored one touchdown this season in November against Tampa Bay and only had 17 receptions but they like what they've seen they like in the training camp they drafted him number three and as Dan mentioned he is a huge target going downfield and very athletic well we mentioned that with the loss of pyramid someone else has to step to the forefront and it didn't take David Sloan very long to do so 158 he's filled up he will have the ball at the 40 yard line as Jason Hanson boots it out of bounds and that's almost unforgivable booting the ball out of bounds on on a kickoff these days with a penalty being that you get it at the 40yard line that's a backbreaker first down for Rodney Peete of the ego so before the yard line over the middle it's and West the tight end making the catch and a first down as he gets it into Detroit territory tackled by Spielman he had West been around now 12 years had was great years of Green Bay over 200 receptions but one of the unlikely players that I mentioned the top of show that railroads knew when he was up in Green Bay decided he could bring him here and he'd be a big help guy McIntyre 62 a 49er with Ray Rhodes he's very familiar with these players first down Ricky Watters goes to the outside the bounds after a short game been a fascinating year with rookie opening day he didn't lay out for a pass over the middle and he was asked about it he said for a wot for a womb big headlines and automatically everybody came down on him but as the year progressed they got what they wanted from Ricky Watters and I think it's because of Ray Rhodes who I could have you know how he handled Ricky early on in the season I think was really going to tell the direction of this football team and the way he the way he disciplined Ricky was behind closed doors and he got his production on the 1,300 yards Zeca in a juggling catch is made by Fred Barnett and he's close to a first down it appears to be just a little short of it inside the 39 yard line that looked familiar has had a very 49er issue look a slant in also a little behind Williams but he does come up with the first down there's a Rhodes influenced by 12 years with the San Francisco 49ers and two shifts laid out there as a defensive back also five Super Bowl rings for railroads it's a handful isn't it is literally first down at the 38 yard line unless you have three finger Mordecai Brown that's a different story that's why so many of us have none today there is he's a little bit he plays so big and it was just a little over a week ago and we look at Jeffrey Loria the owner of the Eagles that it took three pins out of a broken wrist of Charlie garner and he came back after a couple of weeks off to play last week against Chicago and he just spurts for a big one here in this playoff game he is so quick out of the outside and turns it on he is what a changeup he is with Ricky Watters first and goal is loose off the second quarter and partners swings to the outside three it to the five tackled there by Ryan McNeal now Michaels Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf Lynn Swann for this NFC wild card game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia first time a playoff game has been held here in five years second a goal garner again he takes it to the one and he third down would cut back by the little man somebody better get stuck here for the lives waters in the game garnered twice take him out but a two back setting was Saxon blocking he can't get the job done in Mike wells tackles water's fourth down Detroit in the goal line defense and that will come Gary Anderson to put the three on the board Eagles settling for a field goal attempt John Hudson will snap and Tommy Huck will put it down and Gary Anderson with more than an extra point at the count of three the crew and he does 21 yard field goal Gary Anderson with that field goal he's now kicked 14 straight in postseason play he came over from Pittsburgh where he had a long and distinguished career the NFL record most consecutive and postseason graphy us set the end with the Cowboys in the late 70s and early 80s with 50 there is John tearling on the Left talking to Chris Spielman going over the different whoops that the Eagles gave them offensively last time around he is a team down at the 12 yard line slipping on the turf and that will force Detroit to start deep again in its own territory first time Detroit up at the 12 yard line no penalty we sanded loses the football but Morton is there alertly to cover up Barry had gone over 500 handles without fumbling and that he fumbled on backtoback handles against Arizona earlier this season and then just one fumble over the last three months of the year Barry Sanders you're so conscious of trying to make sure you make the tackle there you try to strip it too often let's do somebody else happy exactly forget about it the officials didn't call it that William Thomas a dangerous linebacker and he was on the coverage in Scott Mitchell videotapes all week long you know that Thomas can is so quick he was on the coverage he's had seven interceptions pro ball better insane mrs. burrows and its fourth down mark macmillan of the coverage and good coverage it was Miller that is respectful of Matthews first flag of the game it's on Jeff Ross Moss and really a great for the Eagles I mean a break for the Lions rather than the in that display never happened and this isn't anything that the Eagles could turn down so they'll get another opportunity to go for the first down granted from five yards farther back but they will get another shot at the first down no this is one of the Eagles where just as soon never happened this is the area where you got to be just a little care for you don't turn it over and you would think that maybe they very conservative high percentage very tricky turf down here the more making the cats but he was out of bounds be very careful Bobby Taylor with the coverage actually you throw it down the sidelines and that was a pretty well thrown ball by Scott Mitchell the coverage was pretty good he just literally led more out of bounds I think Bobby Taylor is lighting this thing up so far now he's got his right arm dangerously there on the left arm of Herman Moore but to this point in time for rookie Bobby Taylor's play has been acceptable boys with short kick well he had pressure and that's out of bounds near the 40yard line Royals had to hurry that one now the Eagles take over at the Detroit 39 yard line Rob they feed had trouble with the ball and gets it away waters and waters with a 14yard by Massey at the 25yard line slick little play fake inside and a really kind of a bobbled snap but Ricky Watters gets caught in the rubble and nobody from Detroit bothered to cover the intermediate zone Frank they were all at least 15 yards deep and you have got to account for number 32 when you're playing the Eagles we can't let him get caught in the rubble you have to know where he is here he is like you said he kind of hides in there but somebody has got to be with 32 and he's going to kill you they were they were not within 15 yards of the line and he's saying you know that's a nice play by Spielman because he was the only lion there at the point of attack and he was able to hang in for her Pateras defensive group gain of two second down and eight Rodney Peete is seven of ten swim toward the end zone Fred Barney lunacy grown on a scale of one to ten head to ten even in there kept it in bounds over the defender Rodney Peete who struggled last few weeks particularly last week was dead solid perfect on that we couldn't have thrown that ball and it's further or an inch closer absolutely perfectly delivered by Rodney Peete Anderson for the extra point Fred Barnett at an Arkansas State catching beach touchdown toss 17 maybe singing about significance she brings it back to the David would warm making the tackle on rivers let's it go right between his legs and again with the turf being a little slick that ball takes a funny bounce he protected it with his body when it came right between the legs and it'll be a tough field position to start for Detroit right now Detroit's defense is reeling a little bit cut it back and ran into Lomas brown romanovski taken on the road down by ten points in a playoff football game this betray defense better go back and take a deep breath in that huddle and figure out a way to come up with a couple of first downs cuz they better keep their defensive team off the field for a while Barry having trouble on this tar turf also you seen slip weld it cut so quickly and really hurts it when they run to the right they're challenging the strength of the Eagles defense in William fuller have success I'd go up second down complained he tried to jam and more who looks for doesn't get one Jordans with the covered the shortage almost had the football Michaels order it's looked like he had more of the football at Herman Moore with Brett Perriman out of the lineup you know the focus is now going to be on Herrmann more underneath ads or teach and he's all over the ball Taylor back behind her bit more and I think Herrmann can get used to that for the rest of the ballgame Thomas hoping to stay off the field eeeh thomas the defensive coordinator the philadelphia eagles has reason to celebrate as does everybody at the vet remember in the first quarter and it was overthrown by Scott Mitchell he tried to bring that underneath and Barry will brron was underneath and he picked it off and Geoffrey and Christina Laurie the owners of the team celebrate 23 to 7 going on 24 well the Detroit offense didn't even do a three and out three and touchdown it all began when the kickoff was bobbled by Ron Rivers Finley has converted both interceptions into touchdowns Barry will burn five years of the Washington Redskins out of football for two years then to Cleveland then to the Canadian League then out again and at the age of 32 back here he's made at twenty four to seven will burn in the once super bowl game in which he played Washington against Denver after the 87 season had two interceptions that day four to seven the Eagles five yard line tackle made by mark Woodard the top dog teams have had a terrible time in the playoffs on the road outdoors and Mitchell's had a terrible time on the road this year comparatively speaking at home as you can see his rating 108 point 7 on the road seventy seven point seven and two interceptions and tea today right now scott mitchell is playing like a player who's in complete shock it's not an outofbody experience Scott no matter how much you wish it you wish that it was it is a very Cove and we talked about earlier a good past defender as a linebacker for many years with the Washington Redskins that's a great play and David Sloan said it reacted a little more quickly to it but today he knocks it up in the air then makes the play well we called Rodney Peete spaz at 10 from a defensive standpoint that was a 10 it's just a perfect play biker cafe hold on group any blades saved the touchdown he did the ball just came in just a tad late giving blades an opportunity to get back and break it up so when he saw Rodney Peete he knew exactly that Dan he shook his head he had a phone in just a little more quickly at six points and he'll often it up there where blades could get a hand and break it up Fred couldn't have been much more open yeah from between the 20 to the 5 to hands with about though not a good throw they're gonna tenant charlie Mike Johnson the linebacker the problem with so much time left in this ballgame Jon Gruden the offensive coordinator of the Eagles works from upstairs but the problem for the Lions in this ballgame they just don't have any mistakes left they just are now in a position down 24 to 7 or whatever errors they could make and still hope to win this ballgame have already been used up this hat has run out of lives and right now they need a big play from this oh yeah take a little gamble here then that's what they're going to have to do third and ten eight minutes to go in the half 17 now I'm watching the Lions play this football game fellas and I'm thinking back to what Wayne phonce told us last night he said you know I'm concerned a little bit that my guys aren't a little too loose that that we haven't won all these ball games we won seven in a row and that they're just not feeling a little too good about themselves and we're going to try to talk to them tonight and in real of them in a little bit and right now you know what they're playing like a team that's that's feeling pretty good about themselves from the 18yard line water slips on the turbine it's a loss of three Spielman will get better for the tangle lions nose we look at Wayne Fox even down 24 to 70 have a very explosive football team so far the Eagles have taken Barry Sanders right out of this football game some way they're gonna have to get back to him whether he's working into the passing game or whatever but again I think look at the slip by Charlie waters on that right side of the field nearest us we watched it all evening long well Spielman forced that slip by Ricky Watters he he was in the right place Ricky tried to go back the other direction bust it up go deal with the hand in there that the official was right there he'll trying to cover the slant in two he's all over it you're allowed contact in that first five yards third down 13 642 to go first half Philadelphia 24 Detroit 7 this is Calvin Williams to stop the first down Ron long as the reference might be holding against Detroit 31 defense five yards from the previous spot first down another critical mistake that the Lions just don't have to give we're here am in the former giant who put a superb year with Detroit and six interceptions first intent now at the 15yard line to the 14 yard line they ain't talking about Wayne fonts contending and maybe his team feeling too good about themselves meanwhile we asked Trey Rhodes last night who delivered a fiery pregame speech prior to the Dallas game what he was going to tell his Eagles and he said I'm going to tell on this is about manhood I'm looking for fighters stop I think those that were in his doghouse there are quickly working their way out Fred Barnett's one of them I think it's safe to say that Fred Barnett has not had the kind of year that neither he nor the Eagles wanted him to have but what a first half he's having so far in this ball game Fred's catching everything that's coming his way and over the middle to Dan and that's that's been the problem with Barnett in the eyes of his coach Ray Rhodes and this time totally focused on the ball great concentration is in there right now the offensive line of the Philadelphia Eagles is just taking it to the Lions they own these guys up front and they are kicking some buck twentyone points for turnovers for the Eagles Brooks and McIntyre and Mackenzie and boatswain and Davis these guys are getting it done up front a good lead blocked by James Saxon a good pin block by Ed West a tight end and a lot of Detroit Lions are on the ground Anderson to the point after with 4:59 left in the half Ricky Watters no stranger to postseason play we talked about waters with three touchdowns in the Super Bowl last year but he's the man we got to put the football in his hands well the last time the Lions won a postseason Road game was 1957 they beat the 49ers it was a memorable game though because they were down in that 127 to 7 and so they're gonna have to duplicate that feat here they're down 31 the 7 was 4:59 well Scott Mitchell has to start by completing a pass to somebody on his own would you say this game was that would help Oh no that's not an incorrect graphic it is 31 to 7 can you imagine what is going through the minds of everyone in the Detroit Lions uniform they are stunned this is the type of of a set of circumstances that you do your mind has trouble comprehending that you are this far behind first in town of the 25 up to the 30 earlier today Miami lost Buffalo wanted at rich Stadium 34 to 22 over the Dolphins Miami will take on Pittsburgh next week and then Kansas City will host the winner of tomorrow San Diego Indianapolis game the winner of this game will go to Dallas at Green Bay wins tomorrow or the San Francisco if Atlanta will second and five the 41 Matthews makes the catch the referee legal hands for the face 96 defense penalties deploying first down that's marked gun the defensive tackle defensive end plays both positions he gets called for illegally going to the face areas in the middle working against Scott Conover he concedes got his hand on his face mask and well that's that'll put a little stress test on your neck underneath Larry Sanders makes the catch and works his way across the 53 Detroit first down in the Lions with a couple first downs here on this Drive and it's been a while since they've had any this offense has not gotten a whole lot done here lately and I would keep up what they're doing and that's getting the ball in the hands of Barry Sanders as often as I can make the guy who can make the big plays for you make him a part of this game down well there's there's going to be a spot for Bobby in the years ahead if he keeps going like this great coverage on the NFL's number one receiver right with him and he is all alone with him he was not getting help inside just a superb job in court with us earlier Brett Perriman has gone out of this game the Detroit Lions of the refunded yard reception receiver injured knee but look at that play by the rookie from Notre Dame second exam Sanders its pinball down at the 41 but pinball is a very good description now and it's a very complimentary description when you're talking about a defensive team because more than one guy is making the hit more than one guy is making the tackle and Ray Rhodes has this defensive team swarming to the football they're stamping the quarterback they're stamping the ball carrier they're stamping the receiver they're playing the way he they always looks angry third down and two the catch is not made it's incomplete at the 36 yard line Herman Moore went down to get it hit the turf so it's fourth down I think I might have mistakenly said Miami plays at Pittsburgh next week if I did it's it's Buffalo obviously since they won what I meant was the Panthers will eat the Penguins if you knew something we didn't know oh good good it's good their tax is going for at the 16yard line and made by rod carpenter off the boot by mark Royals you're so good I thought maybe we were wrong on the score there's a guy that deserves an awful lot of credit for the way that Philadelphia has rebounded this year and that's Emmitt Thomas this is his first year of being a defensive coordinator in the National Football a year National Football League a long time assistant a great player in his own right with the Kansas City Chiefs and he has he has molded people like Bobby Taylor and old veterans like William fuller and bill Romanowski and he has made a really cohesive unit out of this defensive football team when the Thomas a great defensive back with Kansas City and I think taken by Ray Rose because so many years with the Redskins he knows this NFC East so well he's done a great job State yard line no it's so improbable about Philadelphia is that I mean railroads was a choice after Jimmy Johnson could have said boo Dick Vermeil could have had the job Mike Shanahan could have had the job who knows who else and finally it got down to roads and he finally got a shot and the next thing you know he's the AP's coach of the year turnover so often the story in football both regular and postseason 38 of the last 40 postseason games have been won by the team with the turnover advantage and that is the story today the Lions have turned it over three times on interceptions and Philadelphia has cashed in on a true case second and seven out of the 19 with two minutes to go on Ricky swings to the outside picks up the first down the Lions were ready to call a defensive timeout to try to get the ball back but waters had other ideas now it's worse down Philadelphia now you talk about those turnovers three interceptions already Scott Mitchell only had 12 all season long the Eagles defense so opportunistic this evening they came in to be disruptive we talked about his great top of the game Dan and they have been just that ten at the 32yard line riki nice his way through the middle there's a flag down in the that's got to be holding that's gotta be holding against the eagle holding 69 offense ten yards four feet first down yeah Harry boatswain that time I think's locked up with Robert Porsche a and it's it's a draw coming right in behind boatswain and he spins him around BC second guy in there from the left right there 69 you seen with the left arm right on number 91 force a and that that happens just two yards right in front of the referee it's you're not going to get away with that Eagles first panel via tonight the Lions roundup time for the league lead in penalties with open but that hasn't been the problem for them today first down in 20 now the 31yard second and about but him quality work upfront by this Eagles offensive line they've been a good running team all year long their fourth in the league after final tabulation and running the football but they've done a great job the offensive line and they've had to make a lot of changes a lot of injuries well they've lost they've lost three of their starters they've had to move a lot of people around but it's a it's a it's an offensive team that again it has been challenged by Rhodes if Moyo baby's fine here's Garner and Garner for another first down before his hogtied by Bennie blades garner led the league and yards per carry for those who carried at least a hundred times 5.4 it's he's taken down hard at the end of the play what Bennie blades winds up and this is pretty close to the old fashioned clothes line where he drives the Florham watch his from the left side of your screen right there he comes in with the forearm and gets it right on the neck of Charlie garnered perfectly good tackle there were no fingers on that mask Bennie blades will give you a pop as content in the 50yard line he guns it over the middle fives we open site in than a timeout fall by the Eagles with 29 seconds to play in the hand few moments ago Detroit as al mentioned was considering taking a defensive timeout down if the Philadelphia the ball at the 17 yard line now they're in dire danger of giving up some more points first intended the 28yard twentynine ticks left the his carpenter he slips on the turf at the 26yard line already and Gary Anderson field goal length this drive began at the Phillie 16 yard line second and seven big penalty coming up here I think on Philadelphia I think they got Antone Davis the right tackle who tackled Antonio London and that's going to move that back and this is going to it's going to put the hurt on an Anderson field goal 70 80 dolphins 10 yards repeat second down so it's second at 18 from the 36 18 seconds and one side Rodney Peete is going to get sacked back at the 43 yard line by Henry Thomas another way out of field goal range that the first sack the Detroit Lions have come up with number one number one and by Henry Thomas who had his careerhigh of 10 and half sex this year in Detroit's defense they've struggled tonight and to let the clock run down a nearperfect first half for Philadelphia three interceptions all turned into touchdowns and a timeout was by Philadelphia even though the Lions and some of the Eagles had started off the field philadelphia figures why not absolute shot at the end zone absolute oh that ball up in the air hope for the defensive foul come up with three really indicative of the never never say die attitude of railroads and pretty smart coach he is on top of this game it is his life he'll tell you that it'll be the trips to the left and suspect without me Pete will just flip it as far as he can look for the DBC file and recorded how in the world did carpenter catch it let's go back to the timeout there was paw by railroads that began there and Wayne says what how in the world three defenders were there 32 is Willie clay he's right on the ball he just jumps up and has it taken away by Rob carpenter Willie Clay was the only lion defensive back that made a play on the football there was a classic case of letting the other guy do it and a classic Philadelphia Eagle for this year of 95 Rob carpenter had been with the JEP suit then with Cincinnati he had been with New England something about him the railroads like so typical of so many of these Philadelphia Eagles very unlikely when they have come together they have played as a football team and so we start the second half of Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia Al Michaels Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf and Lynn Swann 38 to 7 Philadelphia and they'll get the ball as meets and falls down and then the kick is bobbled and covered at the 31 guard Sarek well I can only imagine I can only imagine as the Detroit Lions are going to come out fighting here in the second half you it doesn't take a very creative person to to imagine what Wayne Fonts had to say to his ballclub at halftime Hansen slips and falls we've seen that twice tonight and they sure did he fell awkwardly on the left side but if it's not bad enough the Eagles again start with a football in really good field position but I would look if nothing else for the Detroit Lions to play a whole lot more aggressive intended for Calvin Williams maybe second and ten I think that first call was just to let Detroit know we're not going to sit on the lead we're not going to be running the football on every play they're willing to put it in the air turnover is the big story in the first half three of them converted into 21 points and then that half ending debacle in an zone where the and literally stand around and watch the Eagles convert a Hail Mary for a touchdown the second exam to the 35 and again just to update Brett Perriman with a knee injury and there he is and he is obviously done for the day he was carted off in the first quarter and Barry Sanders has been a nonfactor in the game well now that we've pretty much covered everything that's gone wrong with Detroit we ought to credit railroads and his Eagles because they have played a splendid first task it's hard to imagine this ballclub playing any better than they played in the first half at 6:00 the 38yard Barnett he can't hang on will he clay with the coverage and let's check in with Lynn swampland fallout when Wayne fonts walked off the field he said that short lines are getting beat at every point in every aspect of the game but inside the locker room he was not overly emotional he told his team don't give up if you don't think you can win don't come out for the second half also Tom Warren told me the second half look for a twominute game a fast game for the entire second half and also wearing fonts head if Scott Mitchell has not played well beginning at a third quarter he will not hesitate to substitute in for line out and they're going to have to start at their own three yard line after that tom hutton punt well then talked about the conceivability of the change Don Makowski the magic man on the sideline you don't want to think about coming into a game when you're down 31 or giving the hook to the man who rewrote the Detroit Lions passing record butcher is in the past first swings one Barry Sanders they're liable to go to magic the keys I will say for what why me second down intend fulfill you I want early on the third for thirty eight seven four couldn't get that one away there twopointer there third down how do you figure Detroit the hottest team in the league seven straight wins Philadelphia looks pretty awful last week against Chicago and then you have today's game thanks for looking at three Frank I was waiting for you to explain that I first of all the RIT one of the reasons is Philadelphia has been a great deal more physical than has Detroit they have dominated the line of scrimmage both offensively and defensively and they capitalized early on some really poor passes by Scott Mitchell leads got off to a horrible scarf four down and ten and that's almost it seems as if there are nothing but white shirts around Mary Wilbur in that time let's go back to what we said earlier I think that his red lines came in here they'd won seven in a row they were on a big time roll they were reading about themselves everywhere they looked they were the team that could go all the way I think they just came in here so overconfident and that buddy goes back to the coaching job you have got to recognize that might happen you've got to get their attention this is the team that came in here and totally pulling themselves when they have gotta really put to it Broyles bangs one out of the end zone did it be fair court at the 49 yard line where's down the 50yard line to the outside and it's pushed out of bounds at the 45 yard line Hawaiian McNeil is there for the coverage 31 points for the Eagles in the second quarter alone second highest one quarter total in NFL postseason history you'd think this was a Super Bowl you would have the the only bigger explosion would have been 35 by Washington against Denver in the Super Bowl following the 87th season I was 22 I believe because we were Jack Murphy second in five guardar that was the game I mentioned before Barry Wilburn had two interceptions in that game but all you'll remember is Doug Williams the fantastic day and Timmy's missing Sanders had a tremendous named Timmy Smith MVP what 202 203 204 summer honey they blew out then after Denver had taken a 10 nothing lead Washington scored 42 unanswered points looking on from the sidelines the 45 I won't be what a brilliant design play though that had to come from something they picked up against the Lions defense they've got Charlie Ricky Watters with Mike Johnson they brought him in motion he turned up in Rodney Peete wasn't looking is going to be there and this is just this is fine coaching Ricky's taking a victory lap he knew he would be there water locked up with the linebacker Mike Johnson danara Anderson for the point after I think it's safe to say that that is the most unhappy person in the state of Pennsylvania right now William clay Ford the owner of the Detroit Lions whose high hopes are being at the 18yard line when it starts to go this way for a football team you see swarming type tackles and we'll get a face mask all against Philadelphia but everyone wants to be a part of the Act first out of the 33 bourbon more makes his third catch and picks up a first down we mentioned the railroads last night telling his team this is about manhood and all of the rest here's a guy whose team didn't figure to be in the playoffs but they're here and he's clearly telling his guys it's just not good enough to get to the playoffs you told him it I don't want to hear one word about we're lucky to be here he said this is just the beginning I'll be disappointed if we don't move on into the playoffs into the Superbowl this is no fluke either gray Rhodes is here to stay and flag is down Herman whore not about there by Bobby Taylor with round draft pick at the Giants back in 1979 play defensive back played wide receiver for the 49ers and seemingly everywhere he went things around him improved and this is something they discovered in research that's remarkable yeah you talk about how to roll over look at that 34 players are here this year that weren't here last year just in one season if you exclude the two expansion teams nobody else in this league even came close to that no assistance why keep him because he wasn't having a personnel around if they knew please wonder how there are enough hours in the day to get it all done the 33yard line Jackson taken down at the 46 yard line keep in mind Mitchell only had 12 and 16 games he has four tonight Scott Mitchell pleading his case with whatever official he can get to listen no amount of words are going to make this one comeback first out of the 46 yard line holy 83 offense tenyard she was spot on the foul groupies first down looks to me like Scott Mitchell is saying why I think Scott Mitchell might have just been informed that he's being yanked hate to venture a guess but he was plainly mouthing the words why and I think we know why Don Makowski is warming up the 39yard line water is putting on a bit of a show now I think of all the things and all the different thoughts and dreams that went through Scott Mitchell's head about what might transpire here today I'll guarantee you this never entered his mind up at the 45yard line the 25yard line well you can't blame Scott Mitchell in many ways he's not out there tackling either and that was pretty feeble 5yard penalty from the end of the run no number reported first down first intended garner in the back and guys the way this one is going it starts to beg the question it appeared Wayne fonts was safe he went from three and six to ten and six and there's an injured eagle it's anton davis but it's the fourth time in five years they've been to the playoffs they're getting ripped where there's some good news right there it doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the legs when you see somebody down on the ground for that long that's one of the things that really concerns you is it may be some type of a leg injury but Davis looks like he's walking without a limp big guys like that kind of sway when they walk 64 335 pounds mr. Davis whoa Ella when TV takes his father techno sucker down that's the ball to the 23 yard line tackled by Chris Spielman well Rodney Peete came off a terrible game in Chicago last week Scott Mitchell came off a brilliant second half of the year and then you have today's comparison under folk addiction for Rodney Peete who had that bad day against Philadelphia he is it's been brutalized in the media around here and he has put on quite a show tonight there is the man is expecting felicity the catch is made by Fred Barnett inside the 15yard line but a little short of the first down as it turns out Randall could have gone now at Felicity's a week late you still have the problem next week in Dallas or San Francisco won't be so glaring though with Rodney Peete coming off this game as opposed to the one last week he struggles so Michael e in Chicago has to be happy for Rodney Peete he was 6th round draft pick of the lines back in 1989 on and off starter for many years for the Dallas last year and arrived Philadelphia 32 yard field goal attempt and Gary Anderson has just tied the record set by Rafael sofyan veteran Stadium in Philadelphia happiest place in town right now 48 to 72 on top routing the Detroit Lions who came into the game favored by about three Derry Anderson who just kicked a recordtying 15th consecutive postseason field goal sent it down toward Ron rivers and Alan Williams big yard whoa Philadelphia's going to get their first break of the night James Willis number 50 was the man who created the phone we yet do anything we can count on here is that I'm sure that whoever the Philadelphia guy in there is fighting harder than the Detroit I think and he comes up with the ball if that's indicative of the way this game has gone it's no surprise that when it's all said and done that somebody with an eagle uniform comes out of there with a football Lyons fifth turnover looks like Christie Jones special teams coach danny smith of a lot of these assistants don't ring familiar to you another thing Ray Rhodes did a brand new staff and a lot of guys out of the college ranks somebody puts a big shot on it there I think it's James Willis number 50 of the Eagles comes in it puts a huge hit and that's what knocks the ball loose and this is this is unthinkable as the Eagles now try for over 50 with all those 23 minutes left in the we're about five talked about the coaching staff of the Eagles a guy like Danny Smith is an assistant to Georgia Tech and for the most part Rhodes the complete turnover of assistants what about half and half half the guys had pro experience the other half were just hungry guys out of the college ranks well what a trade tell us he said I wanted teachers I didn't want guys coming to me and saying this guy is dumb this guy can't figure it out or I expected him to know how to how to do this I wanted teachers guys who would pay attention to even the smallest detail second and seven Ricky Watters look at the keys pops groans your groin interview wouldn't know whether to listen to him or burping me looks like a child and and again the Emmitt Thomas elevated him to defensive coordinator got him from the Washington Redskin his Grodin on the right if you look like a choir boy for Donald on they find corridor wide left Gary Anderson will come into trying to put them over 50 40yard field goal attempt by Gary Anderson and is 16 consecutive postseason field goals and a brandnew NFL record Rhodes is one of those totally work off all that coaches a guy who puts in 18 to 20 hours a day and in fact we understand that some of the toll booth operators will call the local sports talk station to let them know what time ray came across the bridge to head into his office 2:30 3 o'clock in the morning sometimes when did he ever leave we asked if he ever slept there he said yeah is that I don't have a bed there and I went to sleep I slept in my chair what if he smiles in his dreams we play I know one thing ray doesn't have a lot of experience with lappers and that's what he's got on his hands here and in the playoffs what you know when does he start taking his frontline guys out and start pointing towards next week Don Makowski in the Magic Man almost had his first receiver Bobby Taylor was there we saw Herrmann more after that pass motioning back to Don Makowski I want the ball second and ten the magic close and that's it journyx mother got in the hand on it to new Marbury Matthews and you imagine a receiver telling Bobby Lane that the Detroit Lions quarterback at the fifties we would have eaten the football in the huddle third down and ten Eagles leading 51 to 7 good coverage but more is able to make the tax despite double it's a great gift Bobby Taylor was there getting support from the inside tried to take away the outside my coal shortage and not an easy bro not an easy throw for a cold quarterback a deep out to the sideline and magic puts it right there but again look at Taylor it's high to play much better than here hands of Taylor off to the races and it's a touchdown I'm sure glad I said that about Bobby Taylor all they need to let off steam 68 yards I think Taylor loses track of Herman Moore when Mackowski scrambles out he really bites on the fact that mikowski scrambles up Moore makes a move towards the sideline and when Herrmann goes deep it's all over mikowski with a really fine touch because the sixfootthree Bobby Taylor almost got up there for the deflection good touch by makowsky coming off the bench cold I had to have that much time to warm up Bobby learned a bigtime lesson there answer for the point after that's a good time to learn a lesson though sure it is when you're up 51 to 7 and that makes it 51 to 14 bourbon war 68 yards and that gives him six catches for a buck 25 on the day you wonder what a performance like this what it does to the minds of both William clay Ford and his son who's assuming a larger role in the operation of this franchise well there's no question that Wayne Fonts ally of the two is William clay for its senior they are friends and mr. Ford is is put in a tough spot when it comes to Wayne and you're right that there will be those who love the Lions and who follow the Lions and who talk about the Lions we'll take the attitude and take the point that this loves negates that sevengame winning streak you know right or wrong to the 7yard line brings it back to the 21 yard line and a flag goes down after the play late hit personal foul unnecessary roughness late hit number 90 of the kicking team 15 yards first down Dan Owens venting some of the frustration which is felt up and down that Lyon bench there was an awkward looking play I can't imagine he'd run in there that late intentionally alright that there's the tackle he's down you can only assume he didn't see him go down and get up nobody in their right mind would hit a guy like that that far after the play that's exactly it he didn't realize the fact has been made picks up a yard or two Scott Mitchell who would have ever figured Mitchell would be out mikowski would be in and railroads could spend the last 20 minutes of the game resting his regulars as we see Witherspoon in the backfield Rodney Peete is still in there though they tried to engage Rodney this week and some talk about the Lions his frustration of all that grande he said I'll have none of that Wayne fonts and the Lions gave me a chance as they drafted him in the sixth round in 1989 and it loses the football I think Rodney got it back get in boy Porche almost took the hand off no detroit's and they've got it lyin bull they get the call tremendous penetration by Robert porche into the Philadelphia backfield the Lions down by 37 making their move bears Porche gets a great jump on the ball Barrett Brooks the left tackle tries to down block on him McIntyre in front of him pulls Rodney had it for a moment there and then had it taken away fumbling nothing new to Rodney he was second relief Dave Reagan fumbles this season that was full the castle that catch is made by Aubrey Matthews he's out of ABS at the 20yard line with 4 minutes and 40 seconds left in the third quarter first inside the 20yard line and it's caught as a 15yard line there were five yard catch over the middle made by Aubrey Matthews and deceptive move there by Mackowski they go into the hurryup offense a twominute feel or whatever you want to call it drop Sloane couldn't hang on let's hide then they could third down and five the first nominated mcafee out of bounds at about the 7 yard line it may be compacting Wayne's problem will now be a quarterback controversy Makowski moves the Lions once again I'm not sure that Mackowski the performance would sustain to the game is well that's kind of cause Mitchell to be said to the bench and quite frankly guys as we all know Wayne fonts has bigger fish to fry at a quarter and that you'll be making good first and goal attaches me by Johnny Morton the former USC close scores and then has the ball shoved back at him and Morton's lucky that he didn't get flag right there he threw the ball at Barry Milburn and that's taunting that's his first reception also tonight dancing for the extra point and that makes it 51 to 21 with three minutes of nineteen seconds to play in the third quarter the Eagles here got a lot of guys up front they're expecting the possibility here of an onside kick they'll get it dancing sends a bouncing ball of the 12 yard line it's run out of bounds at the 22 in three minutes and 11 seconds remaining and that wet turf coming into play on almost every kick off today misses kicking is becoming hazardous to your health here and Hansen has taken Center City some real dumps tonight first out at the 22 yard line two yards faster Freddy Barnett second down still in the third quarter the Eagles with 51 on the board against a team the Detroit Lions whose defense have gotten better in the latter stages of the season and a team that had yielded only 34 points over their last four games total a little over eight point average per game and they 51 we still have a bunch of time to go second and there's a double clutch I think by Raleigh McKenzie the center he'll blame it on the wet turf I'll guarantee you he'll blame it on the wet turf that he didn't mean to have that ball move on him like that but it just double clutched prior to the snap false start illegal snap on the center number 63 5 yards repeat second down second down and 13 for Spielman they love Rodney tonight don't they taking a lot of abuse over the past week asking wine says goes with the position I'm Necessary Roughness 54 defense 15 yards first down that's particularly out of frustration on the part of Chris Spielman II he's such a competitor loves to win Randall Cunningham loosening up actually no certainly not gonna hurt him that way that he you know Spielman had run 30 yards and and Pete goes to the ground and and Spielman is already leaving his feet when Pete hits the ground and he basically goes over the top of that's give me that pretty weak made an effort to miss yeah I think that's that's it's bad enough they're getting beat this badly Ricky waters for gain of 6 to the 42 yard line Spielman makes the tackle would a minute for 45 seconds remaining in the third quarter and 16 minutes and 45 seconds remaining in the Lions season the vet can another game be played here this year yes but only if Atlanta were to get to the NFC Championship Game Miami kept winning since the Eagles came in at the playoff seeded fourth and Detroit 5th the only way you could play another home game would be for a lower seeded team to advance to that game so it would have to be Atlanta otherwise they're there on the road they're certainly on the road next week and again as you mentioned earlier we have to wait until tomorrow's games are played to find out who plays where WP v I are the local affiliate Philadelphia providing the helicopter and giving us the scenic so Veterans Stadium no gain on the play here really fourth down Ricky Watters the ball carrier called the crowd beseeching railroads to go for it nursing this 30 point lead you think he should take it well they don't have to run another play before the quarter range so they'll turn around and make their call on fourth down as the clock ticks down we started the fourth quarter at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia the Eagles on top 51 to 21 fourth down at a walk it is batted at the oneyard line by Jerome Henderson but into the end zone for a touchback as Don Makowski comes in to guide the Lions 408 total yards and of course the turnovers five for Detroit remember way back in the first quarter we talked about turnovers and their impact and the playoff games well the big disparity there 146 rushing yards for the Eagles to only 33 for Detroit 20 yard line Thomas touchdown warning thrown ball behind the receiver batted in the beer Thomas played that like a running back he didn't look like a linebacker looking for somebody to make a tackle he looked like a running back trying to find the endzone and he did well that's the second interception that he's run back for a touchdown already this year and amazingly for a linebacker who is really a very good Blitzer that's his eighth sack I mean his eighth sack his eighth intercept his eighth interception we've got a few sacks to name yeah but look at that just snags at one hand we'll see him in on a little his first Pro Bowl now we're now we're working our way towards 60 Mitchell and Moore and the Lions have watched themselves at good down by 37:58 to 21 with a lot of time left in the game 14:30 up to the 45yard line and I only mentioned a lot of time left in the game because of the shattering of the record book you would think as you take a look at the most points ever in it a postseason game though though San Diego Miami and Buffalo Houston games were both overtime games so we have here the most points ever scored in regulation and they were competitive ball games yeah well this crowds loving it though looks like a soccer crowd newfound love affair with the Eagles here in Philadelphia at least we don't need a boat from the 45yard line line to the 46 mark Woodard makes the tackle for the second year in a row Barry Sanders has pretty much disappeared in the postseason game for Detroit although though Lions have fallen so far behind so early they've really had little opportunity to run him they're running it down this is not to win the ballgame this is just that their attempts at passing the football have been so pathetic there they're just trying to run Barry to keep from embarrassing themselves and run the clock and get out of Dodge was fine with us but getting on to New Year's oh what a nightmare for first out of the 40yard line magic pea well out about us second down and ten at the 40yard line what else is new tackle Yvonne Lomas brown you know maybe you'll pull Mackowski quit Mitchell back in well here was the scene Randall Cunningham came into the game and was acknowledged by the partisans here in Philadelphia I think he's carrying his beeper with us and they gave her a tremendous hand because this is probably his last appearance at the vet as a member of the Philadelphia Eagle he most certainly won't be back with Ursula Randall in a relief role and relief of Rodney sweet Pete the crowds booing they want Randall to air it out they want him to either put it in the air or take off with it if it was a big move by Ray wrotes and after the fourth game of the season with Eagles down one three benching Randall Cunningham that was a very risky thing that he did putting Rodney Peete in Rodney he went nine and three and got him into the playoffs that this man has taken a lot of risk in his first year as a head coach second validate which is lemonade turn specialist is a yard short of the first time take anyways well Ricky gets to sit down and deservedly so we hate to make this sound like the railroads show but it's hard to overestimate what he has done with this football team and the coaching job that he's achieved so far here 95 and he'll be the first to tell you I don't want to hear about it there's a long way to go and but this guy this guy has made a mark in such a short period of time and anybody who's around him or talk to him or has seen what he's done you know he's here to stay this is no this is no place in the pan yes Rock and Randall Hank your ball and shoes that was a huge cheap shot by the law what was that about randal with a little portion water but you know overzealousness at the end of that Willie Clay came in and tackled him boy you just don't take a shot at a guy running like that randall gave willie clayey a little shove but hardly just if I would play did well Randall didn't like the fact that he got tackled by the head but Willie Clay coming in I did have to assume that Willie Clay is going to be taking a leave here now why here's Mike Johnson is the linebacker who comes in and kind of grabs Randall by the head but Randall just come on that's no big deal not to warrant that first ball foul late hit 32 defense he's disqualified plays on his way to the Lions locker room not hurry of us him to a Philadelphia shower first out of the 19 yard line Witherspoon whether another another withers freitas Witherspoon that's what they wouldn't they see him just boom well you said withered Wayne a while ago I thought was his name's food we're going Witherspoon second down and two and what are the four che was there oh this might not have got off in time we may have a delay they say grands was in the grass the layer gave off tonight there's a flag back in the end zone and the field judge tosses it out that's pretty much what it has to be when he throws it out before the snap represents the probably the lack of work with the starting unit Randall has a little hesitant they've had those calls on the clock already at that time they got him most points by one team in a postseason game that famous bear Washington game in 44 Chicago 173 to nothing Detroit against Cleveland 257 and Philly against the Lions today number two that same year 57 was the last Lions won a rose playoff game what's about at San Francisco and the game in which they erased that 20point deficit third down and five now from the 14 yard line 9:45 to go and Charlie Gardner gets taken down for Game four Spielman takes him to the turf and we fourth down 58 to 21 Gary Anderson now will try to make it 61 to 21 that is good flag is down however one more flag and it's holding against Philadelphia why now he's got to go for three in a row yeah holding 57 of the kicking team 10 yards repeat fourth down so Gary Anderson has to do it again he's won it was good but time had expired kicked another one there's a timeout now holding penalty rather now we have to see if he can do the trifecta 41 yards what's awfully good Oh walk to the right whoa Gary too bad that's a tough way for his streak to come to an end yeah that's a shame well that's one of the very few things that have gone wrong for the Philadelphia Eagles tonight so they leaving 58 to 21 that's tipped an incomplete all day long the pressures been put on the secondary has done its job the Eagle defense has created seven turnovers second ten what a weird business wayne fonts under so much pressure early then he went seven straight and he's the darling of Motown and now he'll come home with his team having been annihilated railroads his team given burden a chance this year to do much they're going to eat a Dallas in San Francisco next that's made by David Sloan they will wherever they go we'll have the attention these are the 49ers of a Dallas Cowboys because they are a forreal team they are a team they really not a team of stars they just play well together and the team moves molded by this man he brought in again the most unlikely people to put together Phaleas other places they just excelled here third down three flagged the catch is made by juan river who takes the role of the territory and the styling written down inside the Eagle 40yard line multiple Eagles across the line of scrimmage but no official 93 defense penalties declined first down it began today by telling you about the travails of dome teams playing playoff games on the road outside and this will make it 12 straight losses for those teams there's another dome team going outside tomorrow the Atlanta Falcons at Green Bay that is really outside and yet another : Apple is going to San Diego although the trip to San Diego will seem the most domelike yes it will if you've if you've got to play outside your domes and iego is a pretty good place to do it this wasn't a bad day here in Philadelphia after a pretty cold week sort of Maui like late this afternoon there's Beach weather in Philadelphia for December 30th Maui Saskatchewan down on the field before the game the Eagles were lamenting the fact that the weather wasn't worse they would have preferred a blizzard of blowing winds anything to derail the Detroit offense they weren't so sure they were going to do it themselves but they did she's made by Aubrey Matthews who gets taken down at about the 5 by Jerome Henderson so one more point and it will be the highest scoring postseason game in NFL history Motors city miscues I like that alliteration seven different Eagles have created the turnovers once they spread it around nasty enforcement role to the three yard line second and goal with six minutes to go Mike Mamula and on the stop I guess it all started poorly for the Lions this week when Lomas brown gave an interview and guaranteed victory for the Lions as a matter of fact I think he said it was going to be over by the end of the first quarter what was wish that he could have taken those words back yes nobody wants to be at the center of a firestorm they just had the wrong G he was prophetic enough all right boys slow America that's Sloane's second touchdown is it not it'd be yep he scored one early on in this ball game when it was 77 about five days ago yep so a record has been set most total points in a postseason game 58 to 27 with the extra point to come and I'm sure if you would have asked the Lions beforehand or told them beforehand that you were going to score 27 and maybe 29 here if this is successful I think they all would have been a little surprised to find out they're going to lose the ball game twopoint attempt and as successful as Ron rivers takes the ball in to make it 58 to 29 this crowd by and large is sticking around to send their Eagles to the locker room with a show of appreciation they had reason to leave a long time ago if if staying warm was the reason to leave but there's still a good percentage of this crowd still here at Veterans Stadium and I can only assume justifiably proud of their evening Eagles have been to the Super Bowl once in the 1980 season Dick Vermeil led them to New Orleans when they lost to the Oakland Raiders has to go 10 remember it has to cross the 40 here a little high hopper nope Philadelphia winds up with the football kick was last touched by the kicking team prior to going out of bounds which is a kick off out of bounds on an onside kick attempt it's a fiveyard penalty and a reek it will see a redo is that like part do it absolutely Hondo like fondo flag I don't think it did go ten I think Herman came up with the ball I think nine yard mornings he remarked it right there anything less than 10 remember less in this case is not more Thank You Kelly Kelly knew Larry hello I got the flag would indicate that they ruled that he didn't that's the hoppy water from the gate 10 yards or that was really close ball will be long to Philadelphia first down Randall Cunningham Daniel mentioned his James Saxon carries that might be Randall's last game is an eagle had buddy Ryan not been fired in Arizona I would have thought a decent chance would have existed for Randall to be there next year but now who knows well let's be realistic I think so much of this and what becomes of Randall depends on Randall and and what he's willing to play for economically and and how willing is he going to be to fit into a team system now he has been a team player here here in Philadelphia and well this is a prideful man who's had to take a seat on the bench but he's making a lot of money and no one's going to pay him that kind of money to be a backup to Sandy but having said all that as we were talking about at dinner last night there aren't too many quality quarterbacks in the NFL how's that for a diplomatic way of saying there are a bunch of guys starting a quarterback in this league who who could be replaced easily mr. Randall's problem was fitting into the offense which is really the 49er offense the West Coast offense whatever you want to call it he struggled with it and finally it was Ray Rhodes a bit the bullet put him down and there's so many teams using that offense he will probably have to make some kind of adjustment wherever he goes after Saxton game was a seven to make it third and three it's action again sort of the first time by a yard or so but then in reality Frank the Eagles jettison that offense as well and go to primarily a running attack you know they they give up on the short passing game and go to Ricky Watters and Rodney penis is being asked to do I guess Ray Rhodes if he ended to supply a definition for Rodney Peters Rodney we don't want you to lose the football game we want you to play very conservatively don't put our defense in trouble don't take chances for that alone at the 26 and it is sexy only to the 25yard line appears to be a little short we're three minutes and 10 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter they do not have the first down so Detroit has the football these two teams meeting today for the first time since 1986 it's the first time they've ever met in a playoff game having faced each other for nine years and ironically Detroit gets to come back to Philadelphia next season during the regular season sure they'll be thrilled at that process Lomas brown right there and another Pro Bowl year for the great tackle Kevin Glover at center a Pro Bowler Herman Moore Barry Sanders for four starters on this offensive unit headed to Honolulu but ported today it's to pad his stats a little bit up to the 33 Whitmore makes the tackle can we have more off the two players on the local squad than neither the 49ers of the Cowboys right and stop and think about it realistically they could add a couple more Scott Mitchell had the numbers to go and so did Brett Perriman right and you catch underneath passes that don't go to the Pro Bowl you know you're in a pretty tough league with the NFC had nine receivers with a hundred yards or more 100 receptions or more wall makes the catch on second and two up to the 41 yard line with two and a half minutes remaining in the game what is a game change day if he had one favor no not a receiver with a hundredfoot one with 99 this was such an offensive year in the NFC that you could you could feel the pretty good Pro Bowl team out of the people who didn't get an opportunity to go to go to Hawaii River is up to the 47 yard line and railroads will as his team preparing for another playoff game this week either at Dallas or at San Francisco two minutes left in this wildcard game City of Brotherly Love very happy place on this thirtieth night of December as their Eagles will advance in the playoffs they'll go to Dallas if Green Bay beats Atlanta tomorrow they would go to San Francisco if Atlanta beats Green Bay in Atlanta would go to Dallas second and five makes the catch and that's a first down taken down by David Whitmore marker comes flying in there late facemask rad rom Blum who is a golf pro the rest of the week were you there for either night don't lose his number out you better believe it yard facemask 42 defense 15 yards first down I asked Ron before the game I said is it a good swing thought to think don't whiff so I've got to work with you boy you started too late out yes the next time you start when you're young next life guarantee one thing I bet you Ron blumpkin could recite the rules of golf oh yeah your rules oriented person if you're a referee and the NFL by Johnny Morton Mackowski worked long and hard to get that ball in there and Morton couldn't hold it 1:48 left it'll be a long time until anybody on this Detroit Lions football team forgets what happened here today give it a the lifetime he throws and RB Matthews makes the catch for first down old ball by mikowski in the arc back to that year 89 tremendous season with the Green Bay Packers and before he injured his shoulder the following year over 4,000 yards mr. darling taken down at the eleven you know another thing not that the lions are going to spend a lot of time thinking about it but if Nancy Thigpen makes that cat's last week in Green Bay Detroit is home today facing Atlanta in the dome yep if if their division champs coaches get a get different bonuses because their their division champions a lot of things are good rivers and he is stopped just short of the goal line but then again a lot of unhappy people in Green Bay as well so it's what is is what is and what happened here today is and that first half was nothing short of unbelievable what happened to the lines and really culminated in one of the one of the worst plays I've seen in a long time they're defensive that Hail Mary let's tip an incomplete 12 seconds left from the game David Whitmore got a hand on it to go back to that played an and you think again you go right back to railroads who was the one who called that timeout to give them the opportunity to go for the Hail Mary he's on top of the game once again when they were looking around and several people to turn this job down they looked for somebody with his kind of a record he was successful in anything and everything he had ever done you just don't ever pass up an opportunity for wherever's takes it in for the touchdown and that's 93 points in the game 58 to 35 I gotta go 42 why not it's not often that you score this many points and we're never even in yeah and they picked up two as the catch is made by Herbert wolf you're right Dale you're so now people look at the book and they'll say boy that must have been a wild game 5837 or to think that you could score 37 points you see that but it's 41 38 or something or you know something along the lines of the Thanksgiving Day game that they had with with the Vikings you know something wild like that but do you bring the Bell 37 times and to be never even sniffing victory is hard to imagine all you have to do is look at the lion score 7 points a piece in the first quarter no points in the second quarter for the Lions 31 for the Eagles well at one point it was 51 to 7 now they appear as if they were not going to line up in the onside kick mode so and just say I've decided it's too late to pull this one out ten ten seconds remaining Jeffrey Lurie being escorted down of the field he owner of the team bought it prior to the 1994 season Jeffrey came very close to buying the New England Patriots a couple of years ago but couldn't wrap up the deal and winds up buying the Eagles from Norman Braman this could be the ultimate moment right now and his young ownership as his team finishes the regular year with a mark of 10 and six and thoroughly annihilates that the Troy Lions in this NFC wildcard game when the ovation is beginning there's still four seconds left on the clock and the Eagles are gonna have to run a play and some people it started to come out onto the field got to shoot some of these people off here and allow the Eagles to down the ball and in four seconds it will be official so Buffalo wins today the Eagles win today Atlanta faces Green Bay tomorrow Indianapolis takes on San Diego tomorrow big game by that guy Fred Barnett goes back to place safety here on this killing on the clock and congratulations to these and what a performance a reward to the first person who catches railroads smiling yeah it's a it's a a bitter end for Detroit but if if you're a Philadelphia Eagles fan you got to love this overachieving bunch of scrappers and fighters when that is an understatement we talk about it throughout the entire game but in such a diverse group of talents put it all together with brandnew coaches and superb coaching jobs
