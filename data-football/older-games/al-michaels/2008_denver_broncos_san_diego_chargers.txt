============================================================

in San Diego tonight the 2008 regular season will end with a flourish as the Chargers battle the Broncos for a trip to the playoffs on NBC's Sunday Night Football she's on her way by Sunday night here we go Hey the chargers in the nasty shoulder rockin town to Prague a perfect night 58 degrees clear skies 70,000 fans roaring their appreciation as the San Diego Chargers come out onto the field at Qualcomm Stadium ready to take on Jake Cutler and the Denver Broncos on NBC's Sunday Night Football Al Michaels John Madden Andrea Cramer welcome to the final game of the regular season in effect a playoff game the winner faces Indianapolis in the playoffs next week the loser is done the Broncos have been all alone in first place in the AFC West the entire season so they are trying to avoid a collapse of historic proportions the quarterback Jay Cutler will go to the Pro Bowl they've had seven running backs placed on injured reserve this season but they're still running the ball fairly effectively the problems have been defense they're ranked 188th and special teams tonight they face the Chargers a team trying to go from last rice to the playoffs they were four need at the beginning of the month they have never been at the 500 mark but they come into this game favored to win the game healthier than they've been all season long and coming off arguably their best performance of the season when we beat Tampa Bay in Florida last week and John when you look at the Chargers they were a legitimate Super Bowl contender at the beginning of the season they were probably the most team in the league a month ago but now they've won threestraight how they turned it around well I think the thing is if you're gonna paint and play your best football you want to be doing it right now and that's what the Chargers are doing I think Phillip Rivers is playing as well as he's ever played right now and as you mentioned some of those guys that were injured LT is fighting to get back and Tonio Gates is coming back healthy again the offensive line is getting healthy the defense is playing more aggressively now they're there pressing the line of scrimmage they're doing more blitzen they've had eight turnovers in the last three games and then the one big ingredient that they have that we don't always talk about this special team they have some of the best special team in the NFL and one of the best returners and Darren Sproles he is something special and the Broncos know that he had a big day in week two in Denver meanwhile the Broncos tonight's game they will have a horrendous aftertaste for the next several months until training camp opens in 2009 how do they avoid that how do they win this game well they're gonna have to throw the ball it was funny Jay Cutler came in Norman last night he says right after Madison I'm gonna have to purge 60 or 70 times and maybe that's an exaggeration but maybe not I mean you you don't have a top defense you don't have a top running game okay how are you gonna win the game you're gonna win it by throwing it who's gonna throw it Jay Cutler he has to have a big night tonight crowd is already wild in the season winnertakeall in effect as the Denver Broncos take on the San Diego Chargers on NBC NBC Sports home of Super Bowl 43 when comes you to the following presentation of the National Football League these two teams spent in the final game of the 2007 season the Monday night of last year here Christmas Eve a lot of jawboning going on you saw a Philip Rivers and Jay Cutler going at it and that's been one of the subplots of this game a lot of quotes being thrown back and forth all week long as you take a look at the two quarterbacks Andrea you talk to ball guys how much of this is real I thought I was uncalledfor you know I thought there was no room for it um you know I don't I don't think I would do that to another opposing quarterbacks you know we I think it was kind of fraternity amongst us and you know we try to respect each other obviously um you know during a game you want to win and there's a lot of emotions but you know I thought he and the two men at midfield a couple of minutes ago for the coin to us one thing about Cutler he is open and honest and direct as any quarterback John and I have talked to through the years we mentioned that to Mike Shanahan his folks last night he's he laughs and he said yeah we're working on that Mike Shanahan didn't want to hear that but with Jay Cutler I think of something special I mean he he has something on his mind and he's going to tell it to you whether you're a broadcaster you're a teammate or your as coach San Diego on the costs they've elected to receive the final playoff spot on the line the kick fielded by Baron scores at the three Scrolls but past the 20 and taken down up at the 30 yard line by Carl Pima as we take a look at the San Diego starters Philip Rivers NC State with Daniel Tomlinson TC Chris Chambers Wisconsin Badgers bitsy Jackson Northern Colorado tell me our gates Troy Central High School Brandon montemagno unit Arizona Marquez Magnum all Chris Tillman Indiana Nicholas Hardwick Purdue my golf University of Iowa Jeremy Clary Kent State University San Diego at the 30 of San Diego wins tonight they would have an eight and eight record so with the Broncos but the tiebreak would be division record the San Diego would win that Tomlinson then hands the ball on the Vincent Jackson and the first play for the Chargers is an endaround by Jackson who picks up 17 yards and a first down up to the 47 yard line run out by Champ Bailey and Vernon box you know North Turner was talking about Denver's defense watch how quickly they pursue you give them something going one way and they all go that way and he wanted to run this counter stuff this is trying to throw a black Tim Rivers was that in front of it only the taxes third rush of the season I think the Bronco defenses in your what going one way elevastrum 57 amount Tomlinson for a first down but there's a penalty John Kerry is the official tonight he got in behind a Hester block but the call is against San Diego number 22 often we play rolled it on Hester you know and that was another counter type of thing LaDainian Tomlinson started to his right and cut back to his left and again it's the same thing you know watch him when he starts to the right get that defense going over there and then look what happens when you come back to the other side there's nothing there meanwhile you saw Champ Bailey and there he is Bailey missed seven games with a groin pull got back played last week and now he's on the Denver bench again Steve Anthony Palace their longtime trainer attending to him with Josh Bell a rookie out of Baylor who is with the Chargers in preseason comes on to replace him back in the 37 the pass reaching for it and making the tax but no one official over the other Chris Chambers made the cashman horse this is all the crowd needs to have the first two calls of the light from the officiating crew and April is not here Champ Bailey goes out Josh Bell goes in so they throw right at him the line judge gets overruled Bayley is so being attended to on the bench so Josh Bell will be the target right now yes you have a wiki safety and Josh battle in there the 28th when a defense with two workings in the secondary rivers buys time breweries going do the double strong flags in fact as the pants was intended for Vincent Jackson and now the crimes going to love this because it's obviously defensive interference pass interference remember 50s that's the metal linebacker all the way downfield Nate Webster right that said covered when your middle linebacker has to get down to the deep post to see Webster right they're coming alone behind that's pretty good coverage for Webster all you had to do is keep his hands off him let the safety come in and make the play the the Mike as he runs down the field you just want to make the quarterback have to throw it over your head because you do have a safety in behind you not often do you see the middle and gets swallowed up Josh Bell will get credit for the tackle and 12 let's go back and take a look at what happened to Champ Bailey he got her John without any contact yeah and it's the same way he hurt that groin knee the the first game he said that you know he he pulled or toy the groin and there was no contact and it looked like he kind of did the splits there and when you do the splits it usually is a groin injury and he can't make his case it could be a growing reinjury and in Baylor's case you're talking about a guy went healthy who's as good a cover corner as there is in the league second down and 12 rivers under pressure and he's going to get sacked at that night by evan eva cube on the forward cowboy 10th year out of North Carolina so the Chargers get pushed back and it will be third and long and again this isn't real good pass protection you watch see the Broncos here just get a push on them they get the ends coming up the field and then the push right in the middle and they just push the pocket right back into Philip Rivers third and 17 they have to get to the 1 for a first down six defensive backs with Bailey on the bench three wideouts rivers out of the gun against the throws over the middle goes to pitch to mix the catch at the 10yard line he's tackled by Mark Juan Manuel so it's 4th down and Nate Kaeding will come in to try to give San Diego an early 3 point lead then Bailey will jog back to the Broncos locker room stating now then is fifty year out of Iowa this is a 28yard attempt Mike cycles to put it down and make a ting has given the Chargers in EE for the charges have done all 16 games this year without scoring a touchdown on their first drive get for a year at three nothing 58degree night in southern california left elbow is the word on chief bailey so it had nothing to do with his groin it's the left elbow and they are saying from the Denver sideline his return is questionable they know the groin you can see with no contact how you get an elbow mr. Shido to feel here's chan jackson and this is his first run back of the season as mike shanahan makes a switch Jackson runs it back to the 27 and the wildcard weekend is set on NBC next saturday atlanta takes on arizona 4:30 Eastern Time and then Indianapolis will be in Denver or San Diego for a late game 8:00 o'clock Eastern Time next Saturday Sunday Baltimore Miami on CBS at 1:00 o'clock Eastern Time and then walk our weekend wraps with Philadelphia going to Minnesota on Fox at 4:30 Eastern Time so the matchups are set the lineups are set all it's to be determined is where Andy and the first piece is caught by anyone who's had a tremendous looking year but Shawn Phillips is right there to greet him off so you see what they did Shawn Phillips is a as a linebacker and he just walks out now look what they have here they have a guy here and the guy back here here's Sean Phillip he's looking in here and the first guy comes here the second guy royal comes back Sean Phillips didn't go for anything washing floor that is brought by Tony Shepard the tight end is averaging over 16 yards a catch he has two touchdowns this season both came in the game against San Diego and Denver that's a 16yard gain and a first down for Denver last night we were talking to Jay Cutler you know he kept saying Tony Scheffler Tony Scheffler he has to win his battles if it's a zone he has to win that battle if it's man the man he has to beat the safeties that he is going to be a big big part of our game plan and this pass is incomplete intended to Brandon Marshall let's take a look at the Denver starters Jay Cutler Vanderbilt titled the DeSoto Hoffman Brandon Marshall while receiving the University you see a Eddie Laura Virginia Tech Dana Graham Colorado Tony Scheffler Western Michigan Brian closes before you spend Hamilton Minnesota Casey Whitman Iowa Chris Cooper North Dakota Ryan Harris today who was released by Detroit last year and then picked up by bender is there the pants goes to the outside and that is caught by Daniel Graham the tight end and he'll be stopped just shy of the 50yard line and just shy of a first down it'll be third down and one notice all the formations were see and that's a Mike Shanahan thing he has the first 15 plays stripped and he's going to show you a different formation on just about every every one of those 15 plays to see you hop how you play it how you adjust to it then he decides what he's going to do next to you third and one and they give the ball to Bell Devon was with Denver for three years gained over a thousand yards in Oh six first down let's take a look at the San Diego defense Luis Castillo Northwestern tomorrow Williams Oklahoma State Shawn Phillips Purdue Stephen Cooper Maine Tim Gavin's our state Josh Tucker way far as University when gem takes Clinton heart south something high school Eric Weddle in Utah Antonio Cromartie Florida State the charger pass defense next to last in the league and this is Cutler is going to try to run with it but he won't go anywhere because Igor old CST is there delivering a left cross read one of the things Jay Cutler told us last night is in the first 15 plays he has two quarterback draws here's the first one he's going to do it with a lead and a draw hole schinsky didn't go for it that's a tough play they're always going to have runs in for Jay Cutler and most of the time it's a boot way you know where he fakes and then goes to the other side who said against of three four it's tough to run second and 12 protection is good in the packs for the outsiders caught by Brandon Stokley as he takes it to the 36 yard line tackled by the safety call Oliver and a first out for Denver yes San Diego brings antoine Applewhite you can see there and he just he just kind of comes and plays this position here it's like a joker and he just stays gonna right in front of Cutler watches him if he doesn't run then he comes on a delayed blitz type of thing it was very very effective last week at the 35 out of the shotgun a little toss to Bella Beth puts it back he's inside the 30 and tina.bill with some tough grunting to the 26 yard line Bell as I mentioned a thousand yards in you know six for Denver then they sent him to Detroit in a trade it only lasted five games there and they waved them he was out of football earlier this season he was managing a cell phone kiosk in a suburban Denver mall but the Broncos have seven running backs on injured reserve sauteed him well he got the call no pun intended right and he's the guy that's been there before him he's a legitimate running he was a and that is dropped by Marshall that's branded Marshalls 18 on on target dropped this season more than anybody else in the league on the other side of that coin he's also caught 98 balls you know that's the thing and that's why you keep throwing to him because you know he's a he's a big target he's little he's a great receiver doesn't always run the right route doesn't catch everything but as you say when you catch 98 caught enough of him yeah Clinton jammer went to the bench the chargers elite corner flexing his shoulder or arm cleanest Gordon comes in to Spellman third and inches here's bailed big hole inside the 20 inside the 10 into the end zone from a cell phone kiosk to a touchdown in the biggest game of the season for the Broncos wait the minute the minute you say that they can't run they're going to show you that they can what's been Hamilton the left guard he is going to pull around here and he's going to lead to play and he's going to come right back to the inside Tatum Bell hits that hole and again any any Denver running Brock will take one step and run the ball downhill there is no sidetoside and you just take the ball straight up the field and to the point and there's no play here the whistle sounded before the snap Jason Elam the longtime kicker they let him go of course he's now with Atlanta Prater in his second year allstars number 73 offense fiveyard penalty retry a touchdown by Bell is his first since opening day with Detroit last year I think the you know the play calling mixture was great we talked about the formations but you know they run the pass the quarterback up under center the quarterback and shotgun the quarterback gah I think the Broncos had great mixture on that yes the point is no good he did it even on the plane was wish him dead on the penalty and how he misses this one doors but the lead is six to three like seven from NBC sports.com and nfl.com live coverage of the game and all kinds of enhancements and also bespoke for the horse trailer player of the game look at that shot sundown over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego Denver on top six three the Denver Broncos have scored seven opening drive touchdowns this season most in the league as we mentioned San Diego has not gone the entire year without scoring an opening drive touchdown Scholz takes the kickoff in the seven yard line after the 27 yard line that's where the charges will set up stop for there second drive the missed extra point and at six to three Bailey who they were telling us was questionable the return is already back in the game he hurt his left elbow get to it the second here he puts the sleeve around it so he's back in he'll cover Vincent Jackson as the charges be going to start from the 27 yard toss to Lt by Bailey and let's go back John and look at the Bailey play but we thought it was no contact but you can see right there he starts to fall and then he puts his left arm out there and you can see the elbow got it right there and he grabbed that left elbow just as he went to the ground until the locker room comes back it was xrayed and clearly the xray was negative they're calling it a bruise sucking down tank and Tomlinson river slings it to the outside that's caught by Jackson nice spin mold to turn a 5yard gain and the maybe a first down broke away from Champ Bailey you know and he will break away from a lot of defenders because he's so big I mean look at Vincent Jackson he's 6 foot 5 230 pounds and and and when he gets a ball in the open field and turns right here he is going to pick up yardage I thought he's a threat was a foot that short pass he's a threat at the medium pass and he's a threat at the deep ball spun the leg got the first down 10 your game seven all night for rivers and then fears and the 2601 space in Jackson right and it all started with thee with a playaction even pull the lineman but that really held the defense watch watch the play action here and watch the defense this kind of hold on the line of scrimmage no pass rush and that gave Vincent Jackson a time to get all the way over across the field and deep and you see he was covering him chant Bailey and at that point when he caught the ball of just before thought he is running away from 37 yard tuck it in and he'll pick up a yard getting it to the 25yard line stop there by the tackled Wayne or Robertson rivers against the Broncos as a starter foreign one coming into tonight's game with ten touchdowns in a 120 rating he's had a great season one more touchdown past will tied and bounces long standing charger career record for TD throws and he throws that one very well that playaction passing north Turner is great at creating those situations for him it's a long season for careers Tomlinson has room to the 16 yard line tackle there by DJ Williams the Denver defense we talked about it at the open 28th in the league they have been civil Ike and of course Mike Shanahan was able to beat the Chargers in week two his defense gave up 38 points in the process we talked to his defensive coordinator last night Bob Slovak and he said we just hoped to hold the field goal he said we know that they're gonna move the ball and they're gonna complete passes and they're gonna make runs but when they get down to this area we would just like to hold him to a field goal and they did the first time boobers and a flag comes in as rivers try to get yard John Perry the referee DJ Williams may have come in late and gotten rivers in the back the line judge making the call but when the quarterbacks our runner he doesn't have those match number 55 half the distance to the automatic first down indeed it is DJ Williams Raven when the quarterback quarterback snake CVA he has the rule of running back and of course of course you can't do with DJ Williams doing the play is over the whistle had probably blown have been blown and he comes in there late with a hit it's all over he comes in gives rivers the shoulder the elbow and a little helmet already the third penalty against Denver and they've been costly the passing of fear in school setting up the San Diego field goal this one giving them a first and goal at the 7 yard line and the one prior to the missed extra point double side and set an animal unit in the game here's Tomlinson swinging to the outside it's inside the five and works his way down to the two yard line where he's tackled by Champ Bailey second and goal for the Chargers LT has a little more juice in him I was watching the practice Friday and I said geez he looks like a different guy than he was a month ago and making making these moves making this turn right here this cut and ending the one like he did there is a different guy that he saw a month ago or a month ago I didn't feel that he was finishing right and again we go back to that toe and second goal jumbo Patrick and Tomlinson is in for a touchdown and the Broncos berating the officials they didn't think he got in that's career rushing touchdown number 124 second alltime behind Emmitt Smith for LaDainian Tomlinson good lead block there Mike Groff is off guard pulls and gets a little push right there at the end to get Tomlinson to the goal line we're tomlinson his length rushing touchdown of the season tenth overall Norv Turner watching Nate Kaeding trying to make it a fourpoint game and he does 252 left in the opening quarter the Chargers just went 73 yards in a plays and lead the Broncos 10 to 6 and it's all ready for Thursday New Year's Day the Detroit Red Wings in the Chicago Blackhawks the Winter Classic at Wrigley Field in Chicago that Pittsburgh Buffalo game last year was sensational if you love hockey this is flammable even if you don't like hockey you got to see this Wrigley Field hosting the hockey game Detroit in Chicago 1:00 p.m. Eastern New Year's Day kickoff taken by Chad Jackson and he brings it back out to the 25yard line and the Denver Broncos will go to work at that spot after the Tomlinson touchdown gives San Diego a 106 lead well infamous for the Chargers and terrific for the Broncos game at Mile High Cutler 36 out of 50 eighteen of those 36 completions that day went to Brandon Marshall who had been suspended for the opener some washers making this 2008 debut I'll say with 18 Texas radda a lot of spines referring back to that week to game as Cutler and they set up the mobile school and he picks up the first down on an 11 yard game make it 10 now though spot the ball right at the 35 yard line I think that Jay Cutler right now probably has more velocity on his ball than any quarterback in football and they the you know and he throws it whether it's a bubble screen like that or an 18 yard out of combat he throws it with the same velocity the ball does not stay in the air very long then the 35yard line printer backing up slings it to the outside and through the hangings of Eddie oil rookie at a Virginia Tech who has had a tremendous season royal was the man who caught the touchdown passing the twopoint conversion in that game against San Diego Jay Cutler telling us yesterday he saw him like the second day of organized team activities and he says get that guy from field number two immediately to field number or to feel what and they you know he knew that they were going into this season he had Brandon Marshall and they needed another guy could go with Brandon Marshall when they saw Bell can barely get out of the that's the big screen cedar Jamal Williams the 350 or so pound nose tackle making the stop 39 it's always anytime we see the Chargers play on defense and Jamal Williams it's it's almost impossible to run inside there's no he's heading to the promo to last for years but wasn't picked this season he was banged up a little this season that Jamal Williams probe almost got Murr who will be going to the Provo hands in the pocket and the employer growing up at the 42 yard line by Tony Scheffler but shy of the first down fourth down and Denver to punt yeah and that's where the defense wins and you get them in long yardage that's what you're trying to do and then you keep them from getting the first down you want to see a good young player look at this Ryan Clady here the left tackle set 78 he is one of the most impressive young cast protectors that I have seen Redfern rookie punter at Toledo since a line drive and over by squirrels and the gives our souls gets bottled up at the 28 43 seconds to play in the quarter let's take a look at San Diego a record of seven and eight open a loss to the Panthers on the last play of the game then of course the Hockey League all in week two so they start out on to a threegame November losing streak they lost five out of six then they come from behind knock off Kansas City beat Tampa Buffalo beats Denver so a team as we said at the open that's never been in 500 but all of a sudden on the cusp of getting into the playoffs and then who knows look at that time for rivers again inside the 40 tackled by Champ Bailey at the 37 yard line there they'll say why does he have that kind of time and again it's a playaction and he and the charges used playaction to throw deep a lot of people use playaction to fool the linebackers to throw underneath the charges use it for maximum pass protection and get receivers deep charger receivers have great hands they've dropped only 15 on target passes this season fewest in the league that's good for 34 that takes us to the end of the quarter after one it's San Diego's ten ten verse six and Sunday night continues after these passengers from San Diego tonight's aerial coverage being brought to you by Duracell now Michaels John Madden Andrea Kramer Qualcomm Stadium San Diego the 2008 regular season ends tonight and again the winner to the playoffs Indianapolis will go to either Denver San Diego is done yet see this kind of at stake 10 6 and iego first intent Allanson finds the priests and turn 12yard gain the Damien gets tackled by Bailey at the 26 yard line Barrett there as well first down that comes back with a divot in his helmet but doesn't he look like the old LT I mean like last year and the year before his version I mean he is his for life now he's making he's making the cut but the biggest thing is he's finishing off the run that's his big left tackle Marcus McNeil that's a way that you move a defense around of defensive end back six for Kerry who takes him on the 24 yard line well it's almost like an LT and the whole team John I mean what they've done San Diego has come out of the Crypt they were dead foreign aid and he had a talk with them after the Atlanta game when they became four and eight he said if nothing else guys you know we can't pack it in right now not that they were thinking about the playoffs but he said hey we got to play for pride if nothing else right then you know and he was part of the problem too I mean he wasn't he wasn't able to run he wasn't healthy his offensive line wasn't blocking and to the lot villain but you can see now those guys at one health we saw the Damien Thomlinson they are healthy now and a false start play clock running down and but a timeout actually was called Yoho awake before start San Diego did get the clock stopped LaDainian Tomlinson a stray cooler season game before he turns third in the offseason take a look at that that bar graph as you can see diminishing returns start at about 8 27 28 there you have a thousand yard rushing seasons by age and when they get past 30 as you can see it goes all the way down to just two guys that it at age 33 two guys did it at age 35 so there's Tomlinson rushing yards second lowest rushing touchdowns career low accounting tonight his ninth touchdown so LT at the age of 29 of course the Chargers had to make that key offseason decision of what to do about Michael Turner he winds up at Atlanta a turnaround up second in the lead Peterson second an inane pump fake rivers may have got free money the number three receiver but rivers can't get it to him and philip rivers really likes today i mean he's one of those guys that has been an hback he's kind of been a tight in and now he's the third wide receiver and look at this move he gets Josh Bell turned around and get so much separation on him that Philip Rivers just overthrows him I mean that was a heck of a move to get in that position third night downstairs comes over the game the protection pass is caught under Aaron's gonna save a big smile let's see where they're going to spot the ball very close to a first down and they're gonna put it right on the yellow line which as you know is unofficial it appears to be level C and I want to speculate right now as the line of scrimmage is the sixteen and in fact John Perry signals an official timeout to bring in the chain game north Turner in the first part of this game is running an awful lot of crossing patterns you know the Broncos are trying to play man and the best way to run away from man coverage is with crossing patterns and the majority of their stuff has been these kinds of things you see gates here you get by that guy and now you just run away from them you have the safeties mantoman and you can either run away from going up the field or across the field not even a link now it's a tape part we have your link now not a link to tape forth and less than a link I think with this with this offensive line and with this charger offense right now I think you go for it usually I would say you know the fans want to go for it everyone wants to and I think the percentage play is to kick the field goal in this case I think the percentage play is to go for it on fourth down I'm with you you've got time listen you got Rivers who can sneak it he's already done that once the other thing if she really got greedy before play out she pass yeah there probably be someone wide open in the end zone good chance of it and rivers will do it himself and that will be a first down first down for San Diego at the Denver 50yard line I think that's the play anytime you have less than a link it has to be a quarterback sneak you don't want to hand it off to some back who's eight or nine yards deep and has to run ten yards to get an inch you know that could be a title for a book in the John right right one need those two feet listen to the link you got to go for a first down less than a link you got to go for a first down first I'm 15yard line for the outside into the Flacco's Jacob Hester rookie out of LSU is taken over as the starting fullback remember they let Lorenzo Neal go after last season Jamie windborne makes the tackle it's a gain of two second and eight and that's why they have Jacob Hester in there now because he is he is a good pass receiver as a fullback and you know Antonio Gates gets so much attention that sometime when you put the fullback in behind gates a tight end they don't even cover and so they wanted a guy that has some quickness can catch a ball can get it get open a very wide receivers rolls to his right guys time throws to charges of their and makes the catch for the touchdown flag is down when a quarterback can run just a little in this position would feel and that sit generational column play for illegal as the contest occurred the pockets therefore no foul touchdown yeah you look at Philip Rivers and you know that he can't run he's not in running quarterback but this is what he has to do when your pockets gots to break down just get out but keep looking downfield keep looking downfield and that he not only found one receipt there he found to the Italians and backing up model that ties Dan Fouts a singleseason mark 33 touchdown passes the Ritter's who leads the league and the San Diego Chargers trying to get to the playoffs Levi rivers came into the weekend leaving the league in touchdown passes in December you can take a look at his numbers drew Brees actually through for today he is 34 he winds up with that many rivers now has thirty threes 113 straight regular season starts in December as have the Chargers who have been beaten since Marty Schottenheimer was here in the December game and as we said 33 touchdown passes time the mark set by Dan Fouts in 81 and that's probably why he didn't make the Pro Bowl you say how can you have a year like that and not make a Bubo up when they voted for the Pro Bowl the charts are good four and eight they were and coming off that loss to Pittsburgh as havens Tech has taken by Chad Jackson and they bring it back to the 26 and Jonathan came it's just about the time I mean most of the voting was getting done early in December and the last time of the last image a lot of people had of Rivers was taking a safety in that game in Pittsburgh that the Chargers lost so they're thinking about that they're thinking about four and eight and that's part of the reason he's not going to hold right then that's when Jay Cutler was not that's been Brett Favre was hot right they go to program well my question is why do they have to vote for the Pro Bowl so early why don't they wait until this with the last week of the season and then the whole season is really in and then you vote for who had the best year I think if sometimes we're just premature on those things and that's the thing that really got philip rivers sometimes you need a recount out of the gun cut the swingset flag down left side Brandon Stokley now in his tenth year but of course with Peyton Manning at Indianapolis for a number of seasons John Perry's crew to make the call here the hands to the face against the Chargers to be an automatic that's usually on a jam you know you can jam the first five yards off the line of scrimmage and you get your hands hands to the face defense fiveyard penalty with an automatic first down excuse or that Jam and then you and you started towards the shoulders and then it goes up to the heads as you see Ron Rivera there and and that's what he's all about is is being aggressive get up on the line of scrimmage you know press him get your hands on them and you see that's exactly what happens here sometimes you'll you'll start to your aiming point is to the shoulders and NSA move your hand slides up to the face when you gym receivers on the line of scrimmage that can happen plantation in Midland the hands of Eddie Royal incomplete second down and ten for the Denver Broncos and that's the second one that went through any Royals hands and they were saying last night what great hands he has and what big hands he has and what strong hands he had when Jay Cutler throws that ball there there is a zip line if there's a there's a zinc and he does at night I mean you know you don't like for a quarterback to do that I mean don't don't show up your deceivers don't show up and on just go back to the hunt for drop tonight by the block a second by Royal the flag is down as any royal this time they sure handed you know what's the difference you know where's the line between a a fiery personal cutter chop lot number 21 the runningback Tatum Bell now you see you you can't cut a guy who is engaged now watch this you're gonna see the center Kasey Wigman is engaged right there and then right there and then Bell comes in see wigman comes off he gets engaged right there you see and then you and then the cut so you kind of a highlow thing and that's illegal second and 25 from the 16 verticals just just run them all straight up the field Cutler avoids the sack fires over the middle and incomplete any royal that time covered well by Steve Gregory the safety Giles Tucker was the guy who almost had the sack from the outside another flag and so far the charges are doing a great job on Grand Marshal number 73 offense Kennedy's been declined result for the play third down that's Chris Cooper they'll take the play because that's going to make it third down and 25 remember in the last game you mentioned Brandon Marshall caught 18 passes against a charge as well they're not sure exactly what's going to happen going back to charges but they know that Brandon Marshalls not going to go hasn't brought a pass tonight and then you were talking about jamming being physical with them that's what they want to do and that's what they are doing the Brandon Marshall the best way here third and 25 to the left side that's trying to set up a scheme for bail but that games only four or five yards Ryan Bingham makes the tackle in Denver down by 11 will punt and you really see the difference in this San Diego charger defense I mean Ron Rivera has brought something to it and that and that something to it has been more aggressiveness more press the line of scrimmage more blitzing more going after the quarterback those kinds of things they don't wait and sit and wait for something to happen till he took over for tech to try and midseason Brett currently looking his part fielded by Scrolls down slow lanes it back out to the 42 yard line with 942 left in the half san diego's 17 denver 6 Hill for their first Super Bowl performance ever the Bridgestone Super Bowl 43 time show Bruce Springsteen East Street Band February 1st Super Bowl Sunday right here on NBC from the 42 will begin this drive up with a oneyard gain to the 44 here's where the Chargers have really been effective with the playaction pass and look at the protection that it gives them right here and then they can go those deep crosses so they use it you say playaction and to hold the linebackers and so on but the other thing it does it gets Philip Rivers time to hold the ball back there to let his receiver get all the way across the field take a rivers that's Chris Chambers who's able to make the batch at the 43yard line the ex Miami Dolphin pulls that one in on the Denver side of the field first down it was with Philip Rivers said one of the things that they want to do is work out here to their left side Andre block so any time you see him singled up there Philip Rivers is trying to go to that area and of course you have to read that out but if they don't have help if they don't rotate 14 they're gonna do that I'm not sure what the heck great one turn right but I don't think that's what's in the rule not a friendly head slap Tomlinson I mean Denver's already been penalized four times tonight and they've been big penalties important you know and I think that's that's one of the points where there's a fine line between being fired up and then going too far and sometimes you know you say what what is too far anything after the plays over anything after the whistle blows to me is too far and that's too far no one saw that well don't give the official any opportunity as well today on the nine San Diego three possessions the two touchdowns in the field goal as a first down taking me to the 26 yard line the boys tackle there by DJ Williams that's a gain of 16 and that's what I was talking about Jacob Hester they put him in he's a good receiver as a fullback not a tailback and then you'd go playaction passes he he's a lead box blocker he fakes like it's a block and then goes out into the flat and no one gets to him until DJ Williams found of the fact DJ Williams was a guy that he faked blocking and then he ran a pass pattern the second quarter down scrolls is the tailback I push down to 26 or name it was ten pounds at birth that's why he's been called tank his entire life and tank grew up to be all of five six and 181 but he is he is something special and he's been special on every level I mean he was a great high school player he was a great college player drafted by the San Diego Chargers and to me he offers so much to this team you know as a as a running back as a regular running punt returner kick returner his contract is up this year I think he's a guy that somehow they have to figure a way to keep I do tell he'll be much longer second áfiveá give it to him again and he gets rolled down at the 20yard line and you've got another penalty was funny Mike Shanahan was talking about Darren Sproles last night and he said I'd like to sign them just so we don't have to play against him anymore holding number 68 offense 10yard penalty second down that's Chris Dielman who will be going to the Pro Bowl for a second straight season Chris Dielman was one of those guys remember a year ago he was up in Seattle he was going to sign with the Seattle Seahawks almost it and the Chargers realized that you know we have a good offensive line and that's a big part of what we're doing and we can't lose this guy he did left side and tackle Marcus but we are human in the Senate no sir watch the spring yeah and another flag here false start 66 offense fiveyard penalty third down Jeremy Clary right tackle let's go to Andrea well then turn your dates is back in the game but he missed a few plays since catching that third down pass they were checking his right ankle they were looking at the stability of his foot they try to figure out what's bothering him he pointed to the outer part of his right ankle and his Achilles they heavily taped him put his shoe on tested him pushing off obviously good enough to go back in cut a toe injury last year is bothersome I said this year said he's as healthy as he's been in a long time as the catches made by Chris Chambers at the 20yard line on a second and 20 play Josh Dell with the coverage and yeah I think the way Josh bells play and they don't have to worry about Dre Bly look at the cushion that he gives off here and Chambers just runs up holds them and then makes the cut and he made it look way way too easy 18 yard gain so it'll be third down and 2 then Josh Bell was actually in the charger camp and then then to pick them up in October third and two and time ascending across impact objection boobers is after the block to the fiveyard line in the first down and goal so they run it again and rivers takes Bailey out of the play who would have thought that your lead blocker is your quarterback good that's what Norv Turner was talking about watch when you get the action going one way look at all this Denver defense are going to come back the other way I mean any any time you get quick pursuit you give them flow one way and then counter back against it I don't know if I'd really call that much of a black bear and for a quarterback it's okay it got in the way if anyone else did that you'd see Brett still what's blocking I've ever seen in history of the NFL so the work but reported by which we walk bangles Grossman game take it to the 4 yard line it'll be second down and goal when they were on the next play will have under 4 minutes to go again the Indianapolis Colts will play the winner of this game either in San Diego or in Denver and the Colts of course redhot end the season with nine consecutive wins and Peyton Manning right now is a prime candidate for MVP yeah I think you know he would be he would be the main guy who said we've said to me who's the MVP in the NFL I think it has to be Peyton Manning and who would have figured of course Peyton start of the year missing all the training took a while to look like Peyton and that's one of the reasons I think he's the MVP busting tackles LaDainian Tomlinson is fired up tonight there's there for a while where he wasn't making the cuts and then there was another point there where he wasn't finishing one he is finishing runs tonight talk about a team that is peaking a team you want to be playing your best at this point I think the Chargers on that road second touchdown of the night for Lt Katie's extra point is good and with three and a half minutes to go in the opening half with a playoff berth at stake the charger lead is 18 first global dance competition country versus country on superstars of dance and that premieres next Sunday January 4th right here on NBC beautiful night in San Diego 70,000 Qualcomm Stadium charges have scored on all four possessions Katie's kicked taken in Jackson from the seven yard line and the widely super brings it back to the 30 well for the Broncos the season started beautifully with three wins and they've been in first place every week uncontested possession for seven running back so have gone on injured reserve cutler eclipsing Elwes record for passing yardage but they've lost their last two games three of their last four and in danger of becoming the first team ever to be in first place all season and then drop out of the playoffs after their last game like Shanahan trying to avoid as sees me what the Broncos have missed the playoffs for the third year five and this is paid until taking it up to the 37 yard line and I think two things they have to do offensively as one is what they just did you know stay with the run don't just you know make it just a passing game the rest of the way out and and get to get Brandon Marshall involved I mean there comes a point here we know that he caught 18 and the first time these guys play then and I think that you know he has to be a part of this plan I know the tight ends are a big part of it but I think that you have to do something to this guy and get him involved in this game there's a little shuttle pass tatum bell he'll get the first down and it gets in the field by Eric Weddle first and ten yeah and that's probably a pretty good plan right here because you know that that they're worried about the receivers and they're worried about Marshall and all this and and they're they're not really paying a lot of attention to the running back or to take them about so you're able to get the ball to him you know and get a block and get a few things in front of them so they can do that under center or they oughta lightly by kissing me it again we'll take the ball into san diego territory to the 48 yard line and that is going to take us to the twominute warning Broncos have all of their timeouts two minutes to go in the first half in San Diego where the Chargers lead Denver 24 to six on Sunday Night Football so the halftime show bring you uptodate on all of today's action no that's not 30 rock that is Horton Plaza right here in San Diego with the regular season coming to an end one playoff spot to be determined and it will be determined in this one right now an 18 point lead for San Diego second and seven fires over the middle of the 30yard line and finally he finds Brandon Marshall his first catch of the game Langley nine on the season tackled by Cooper first down Broncos going nohuddle here they there was a twominute warning threatening the traffic and that's brought by Stokely so Cutler with that rifle twice over the middle once the marshal now to Stokely first out of the 14 like I said he doesn't leave it in the air very long I mean you talk about a guy threading it out like he said Jay Cutler couldn't really thread it look at this one I mean that threads through everything right to his guy and it's tough for a defense you know you're in a zone and and you have to react to that and and the balls not in the air very long so you don't have a heck of a long time to react timeout taken by the Broncos their first Sunday Night Football being brought to you by frost brewed Coors Light when the mountains turn blue your beer is as cold as the Rockies by Nissan inviting you to shift the way you move through the world by Wendy's it's way better than fast food it's Wendy's and by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance Jay Cutler will break a few fingers in his career yes he will they don't you just filled it but they just went to that you know passing them with those screens and stuff that he could do this all night to this Pinkman last two one official looks back to the other and they say the bounds it was Tony Scheffler covered by Steve Gregory he puts his arms up and of course you can challenge within the last two minutes so if it's close enough it has to be a booth review that's one thing that Jay Cutler wanted to do is get the ball to Schaeffler on their safeties and remember there's no force out rule anymore so if you're thinking about well he got forced out of bounds not applicable anymore then nothing came down before his feet went out yeah it's your one D equals two feet but he didn't get one made down inside and the foot was out right nothing to look at upstairs and now a stoppage here the previous play will be reduced it's just as I say nothing to look at maybe there is something we're gonna look at I don't know what they're seeing that we didn't but they're gonna take a look upstairs with 113 to go in the half willst and remember there's no more force out so you have to have both feet in and possession he gets one foot down the schaeffler but before he gets the second foot down in the endzone you'll see his knee or shin and his backside are out of bounds before the right foot gets down now as you said a year ago that probably would have been or could have been called a forceout you know if you were in the air and the defensive guy hit you and knocked you out it would be a force out but that's not a rule anymore parry will make the call after reviewing to play the play stands ask bald incomplete pass the left foot dude hit inbound but nothing else incomplete class please reset the play clock to 10 seconds play clock to 10 seconds so they have to get the snap Oh a fairly quickly here base it will be second down and 10 the balls of the 14 that wait for John Kerry to make his way back toward the play they'll start the play clock from 10 and a second down and ten Don the 14 so Connor goes to the well that well over the middle again and Oliver is there for the pick yeah I think he was trying to force that one to Brandon Marshall you're going to see here easy he's the inside receiver he's right here and he starts up and he comes underneath oh that was pretty good coverage I mean Oliver was on his outside shoulder and then he comes underneath undercuts that thing that's pretty good coverage I mean that was he had him oneonone that's not a bad decision to throw it there but that was very very good pass defense by Oliver that's for red zone interceptions this season for Cutler who had none after he got the job from Plummer two years ago and none starting all of last year a minute and seven here scrolls now Rose takes it on through the 26 yard line it's his helmet take it off join going on here he doesn't see himself you know it's just a a kick returner and a third down back Darren Sproles wants to be in every down back and he has that kind of you know your personality I don't I don't want to ever sit on the sidelines I don't want to be a backup I don't want to be a special second for a little slows and it's incomplete he was out of the pocket nobody was open and that stops the clock with a half minute rivers Philip Rivers has played very well in this first half and I think north turner has done an excellent job of play calling I mean he is really you know had a great mixture he's had to run he's you know had the pass he's had the playaction pass and those deep crosses and he's really put this Denver Bronco defense back in there he'll no charges will be content maybe they won't let's say that they're gonna do keep it on the ground enough Scrolls is going to put them in the position up at the 36 yard line if they want to take a timeout to at least trying to get into field goal range and they do once they got the conversion with 23 seconds they will take a timeout they have one more remaining as rivers will try to get them into range for Kaeding who last week had a 57yard er at the end of the half and tampa yeah when the when the kicker starts to take his pants off then help me he thinks she's gonna have another shot here somewhere you'd be comparison tonight rivers with that one touch snap back but look at the rating says at all we know the rating is an esoteric thing and it's full of a lot of stuff but it does give you a pretty good indication and you compare the two who's having the better night first and ten at the 36 yard line and Neil was moving at a time at left tackle Paul start number 73 offense fiveyard penalty first down San Diego tonight field goal touchdown touchdown touchdown we talked about it at the beginning about you know Denver's Achilles heel the defense ranked 28th in the league and kind of looking like the tonight yeah they're not a very good defense and they're not a good tackling the offense but go back to your Philip Rivers in the first half that he's had and against ignored of trimmer and the play calling I think he's been excellent bitch we had those crosses again I mean that's that's the thing that they're they're trying to do they have a plan that you know we want to go playaction pass and we want to run those crossing patterns and and this whole first half they've been doing it the whole time Georgia trying to the first team to make the playoffs after having been four games below 500 with five or fewer games left in the season second 15 when it was Scrolls we could take it down up to 38 yard line and that should do it for the opening half of the San Diego Chargers trying to work their way to postseason trying to get the host Indianapolis here next Saturday lead by a score of 24 to 6 coming up next the Toyota halftime show these messages three local NBC station we're gonna play every down like it's our last we invoke there hit him in the mouth and try get sassy West title I think every week is a different week you're not playing the team he played the last two or three weeks so it's a whole different ball game we put ourselves in a great position in a position of control our destiny who you walk out this shell at the end of the game you shouldn't have nothing left you should be exhausted tired beat up a lot of hate and between these teams it all boils down the heart who has the biggest heart it's plain and simple you win you gone you lose you go home and on that note I'll Michaels John Madden and Andrea Cramer as we come back to Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego the Indianapolis Colts will either come here next Saturday or go to Denver next Saturday night right now it's a 24 to 6 lead for the San Diego Chargers Brandon Marshall of those eight two catches he in week 2 and tonight limited to that one lead in the first half right over the middle Denver will get the ball to start the third quarter sends it toward the eastern end zone at the fiveyard line charge action all season to the 27 yard line let's check in with Andrea Kramer Andrea well I just talked to norv turner about what you discussed with brandon marshall what they're doing against and he said they're doubling him when they can and mainly they're being physical with him at the line of scrimmage tarnish strategy for the second half up by 18 he said we have to keep attacking offensively he said they're so dangerous we can't let up as for my China hand he said we're being hurt in a ton of possession battle we can't have ran outs and he's exactly right about that because the Chargers have had the ball on those two thirds of the time that's by the runningback Tatum Bell and Bell takes it to the 38 yard line to move the chains first down now the Broncos came out here with four wide receivers and you know Mike Shanahan when you know when he gets backed up he's gonna go after you he's going to attack and attack and he's going to spread you out and that's exactly what he's doing again here for wide receivers flips it out to the right side it's the whooping Eddie warrior but he can't get free Eric Weddle right there with him Dean of a couple second down yeah they're playing that screen I mean in fact if that inside guy stays back here or runs parallel the defensive back Eric Weddle is coming up on them they're not letting them get that play and staying off it and then if they see him stay or go parallel they're coming up that was an interesting shot with rivers on the sideline second and seven and it's threaded into the arms of the tight end Tony Scheffler he makes the catch and that moves the chains the ball is at the 43 of San Diego first now we talked to Jay Cutler last night that's what he talked about wanting to do is is attacking the safeties he thought the the biggest weakness in the and the San Diego charger defense were their two safeties and he thought with his pants mr. catch of the night and here is any loyal inside the 40 the spot the ball at the 37 yard line it'll be second down and 5 I think the thing with the Broncos is if they can stay in manageable situations they can make plays because when they get the penalty and obviously the turnover and that just kills you call it second and four from the 37 again that costs turns it back to Fiat first down metal inside the 20 inside the 10 and that's exactly how Denver had to come out and start the second half with a touchdown right and it's exactly the way they started the first half I mean it was it was Dana bell and it was running and it was doing those things you know a good mixture and and that's it I mean he you can't say that it's gonna be a pass over down and they get any and in the shotgun watch Tony Scheffler there right there he makes a good block and that's the block that really Springs Tatum down Mel gets to the end zone for the second time remember the extra point was missed earlier by praetor Jason Elam in 15 seasons missed a total of three this time the kick is good and so 2 minutes and 13 seconds into the second hand the Denver Broncos shaved the lead to 11 as San Diego's on 24 to 13 get data McDonald's John loose Olas card it by the sea carnitas tacos platter that's that's a good place I I've been there like five or six times and I'm only gotten in there once you get it's always crowded yeah the parking lot all the way up to the beach but you had you had dinner in Mississippi and New Mexico this week I heard about that Deming New Mexico from Christmas dinner that greater to kickoff Broncos getting back in it at 24 13 comes up deals Darren's bowls squirts through the middle tackled up at the 31yard line tackle made by Lewis green is legal back to the score we talked about Brandon Marshall again watch the block that he makes on that touchdown run again he's only caught one pass but a wide receiver today has to do a number of things and he comes in on that crack and he gets Shawn Phillips so that's what God started and Tony Scheffler makes a block and Tatum Bell makes pretty good run Tatum Bell will touch down watch tonight of 26 and 37 yards the day I was at the 31 yard line LT secondary dozen shots at Phillip will take over and gets to the 36 yard line when Warren is there it'll be a gain of five make it four second down and six and that's where that's what the Denver Bronco defense had to be be talking about is at playaction pass with the crosses and again they as you said they had it covered and he comes out of his play action he looks deep he had no one working on the line he has it I saw it in practice the other day and I said this guy looks different he looks like he did a couple of years ago he's back and then you wonder is that gonna translate into the game and sure had what'shisname to jump back there another jump that there then there's a burst off the field and then another cut to the end he said this isn't about as far as I can go what's that first jump cut there and then he has another one right there there's two in the first five yards then he has another cut coming up there and then he gets to the sideline that's his longest run of the season that's 45 yards scores is the back the fake form to his right the employees you know sometimes it takes a pinball to tackle him because he's about a 300pound guy you know he gets out there you go you better get four or five guys pinball on him hit the bumper here's a pitbull alright it just bounced off he just turns around starts all over again and then again about five six seven Mike James again you will give Scrolls it will be third down and short now for the Chargers you know Damien Thomlinson brought up an interesting point the other day he said I wish that I would have hurt my toe earlier in my career when I was younger then I wouldn't had to put up with that too old stuff right like is it an injury or as an age and and I agree with them you know that I'm in a minute that you know that he doesn't do something or his stats go down he looked can you say well you know he's getting old and he's done there's there's there's a lot of gas in that tank I think there's a point gun that plenty against tonight third down and three three backs behind that time here is the best screen runner and football is Darren Sproles he was helped along by Denver Bronco poor tackling but they this guy whether we know on Funt returns or no on kick return with the screen pass here two backs going one get a blocker out in front and the moves and meheecan he can make those right and left as he goes up field watch how he doesn't this was an amazing amazing running back first time they've shown that look with Nanae and mano ma Luna in the backfield with Scrolls canings extra point is good so Denver scores to start the half and the Chargers answer immediately San Diego 31 Denver Thursday Porter's San Diego on top 31:13 Tomlinson two touchdowns tonight scrolls with one Chad Jackson running back kicks for the first time this season to receive Nate Kaeding to put it in the air winner hosting done 408 Jackson in a six yard line loses the ball as good they meet special teams players signal on he say signals Denver Jay Cutler coming out you talking about a guy with a lot to think about not only what he has to go through tonight and through the course of the season he found out in April he was a type 1 diabetic so there's an entire program that he has to go through of course every day a special program going to the games he has dealt with it at the highest level get more from Andrea in just a second as he comes up at 1st and 10 from the 18 yard line that pass is not bad and their septic equipment and you get gone Louise Castile comes up with it so it looked like it was simply deflected as Shawn Phillips got a hand on it and then castile has it popped right in to his breasts that's what defenses can do now when they're trying to throw that but that bubble screen out there is you just get a little penetration you just get up the hill because he's going to come straight out with it Shawn Phillips doesn't he sees it he can just get up the field Cutler turns that way and he just gets up in the air he knocks it up in the air and that boom there's his teammate Castillo to come up with him that is a Christmas present three days late Castillo second career interception the ball is at the 14 yard line give it the time once and he's inside the tent inside the five touchdown San Diego now this is charger football that we know from last year this is a Chargers at counter good blocking Oh guards good offensive line play and excellent running by with Damien Thomlinson yep they're Vincent Jackson does his job again Denver doesn't put up a lot of Nate Kaeding to make it 3813 Tomlinson with each rushing touchdown all season coming in as the accurate tonight is Sunday night now this night has been the charger night to this point remember San Diego scored 38 against Denver in the week to lost the game they have 38 tonight in less than 36 minutes failing to kick off the J Jackson the scene we've seen played out a few times and because of all of the San Diego scoring Jackson up to the 30 we started to talk about cutlery type 1 diabetic before let's go to Andrea yeah as for his ingame routine between the time he arrives at the stadium and the end of the first quarter cutlery tests his blood sugar levels about 8 to 10 times a game so this is what it looks like typically he's on the bench along with trainer Steve Antonopoulos see Brix is finger they take the reading and in this case and look good now they tested it before the first drive and also after the first drive now if his levels are low he feels shaky and you can break any so that it takes just about a minute and his pants right here is deflected by Eric Weddle I mean John he's about the coolest kid in the room in a way and honest and frank and we talked about it at the open about how you know mike shanin we've got to work on that but that's that's pretty amazing to have to go through that and play quarterback in the knife snow but you know what he is even more than that he's a role model for any young person that has juvenile diabetes that you can do anything I mean if you have and still you can perform on this level I mean that's that's the thing I think that you know kids can look and say you know if Jay Cutler can play professional football and achieve at this level that gives me hope to do whatever I want to do and I think that's that's the biggest thing with what he's going through right now you can get to the Pro Bowl third down and two from the 38 the crowd in full war and able to convert as Marshall makes the catch up to the 47 yard line he's tackled there by Quinton jammer and I think that you know the Jay Cutler has always been one of those guys that we know has velocity drills a ball in there and because he drills the ball in there he doesn't have to have wide open windows that was a very very narrow window hundred catches now for a marvelous season steps up and that's one Maqbool effect of a first down as he takes it to the 42 yard line Marshall last year a hundred two catches this year despite missing that first game he was suspended a hundred one catches into the Provo with along with Cutler well I mean he's another one of those those big guys six foot four 230 in there they're such a big target on the backside and Cutler finds the open man he goes to the tight end that's Tony Scheffler and Denver takes you to the 30yard line for a first down you're getting back to who you know Brandon Marshall min so but you kind of expect that in the tight end like Tony Scheffler here now watch when you have an arm like that you know you don't always have to have your feet in the right position right because what he does is he throws with torque I'm his throws with the middle or the core of his body I mean with an open state's ineffective to get that much on it is amazing Tatum Bell on the ground remember that you know again it's honest this Cutler is at one point this season he says I throw it harder than out Elway I don't know about that I don't know that you win any contest for throwing harder than any quarterback but I'll tell you I mean John Elway did the trying had that thing remember they called the Elway cross when he would hit you in to check the chest the cost of the football would be embedded but Macross and second intends day out of the pocket he's very effective he's open and Kayson you know he's very effective out of the pocket usually because they run those bootlegs he'll fake into the running back one way and then quarterback going the other way but they say that against the threefour defense both the chargers said that and the Bronco said it that bootlegs are not effective Jay Cutler thought that he could run some bootlegs tonight out of shotgun it was amazing that you think what he's doing almost as many touchdown passes out of the pocket as he has from the pocket despite going about a sixth as betting third floor and now we'll swing it back across the field it gets tipped twice and incomplete so it got a volleyball first buy a charger Gregory is there Marshall couldn't hang on and it's fourth down and four you probably come to a point you say you know you shouldn't throw across the field and you probably shouldn't do this you know right young quarterbacks to throw the quest field because the ball usually is intercepted and you do that but I think when you're in this situation that the Broncos are now you're down 3813 you just go for anything and everything you have to you're down by 25 you have 21 minutes and 16 seconds left in the season more than four and that is caught he goes to Stokely who's made so many of those clutch passes through the years a lot of them on the receiving end from Peyton Manning when he was at Indy first down though like Wes Welker is no Stokely is a a Welker type of guy that just knows how to work to slop you know they run that option if you play inside I turn outside if you play outside I turn inside okay I just turn around and let the quarterback have my outside shoulder because the defender was inside 17yard line flip it out marshal swing to the outside it's away from casein but then the rest of the charges are there surrounded by blue shirts minimal gain if any second down the Chargers are pursuing very well so they're having good success on anything that goes laterally you know her stays in the backfield and Denver's having more success when they when they go vertical get the ball up the field right except that one that one toss to Belle did result in a touchdown apart from that they've been right there Lawson three on the play five minutes to go on the third second and 13 stokeley to the 12 yard line party making the tackle it'll be third down and five for the Broncos to see what the old veteran Stokely did is he saw Greg becoming and right there at the end his head was up and he saw me just put his head down and said if you're gonna come you're gonna go over my head not into it he's been in the rodeo before this is how he gets to be rodeo again could just duck he wasn't going to take that shot 35 the outside and trying to get it to bail on a play that looked a little strange that's the kind of stuff that I was saying didn't seem to be working that's definitely just throw sideways them and they were able to to run sideways a link to his phone sideways is not very effective can you see here he is that then this is what Jay Cutler sees as as he looked at there and saw that no one was on him so he tried to give him the ball quick though lukla Marni got right there in a hurry so again Denver to try to convert on fourth down fourth and five but the girl is an extract it was Stokely who had it he had it in his grasp and couldn't hang on and they turn it over to CVA going down just 413 remaining in the third and the Chargers up by 25 up two weeks from tonight on NBC the Golden Globes the date January 11th right here on the National Broadcasting Company San Diego California on this last Sunday night of our eighth force contain the boys at the 12 yard line second down they'll teach them like 14 carries 95 yards and three joints to the end zone under 30 look at that nobody has scored more touchdowns before that that age third and yards and scrimmage fourth and Russia start thinking about what his bust will look like can't someday now it spoils anything second bite of mine boys six Darren Sproles up to the 17 yard line you know it's funny John I keep thinking about this time of year everybody keeps talking about it you know this is the team you don't want to face nobody wants to face this team in the playoffs you know what if it stays this way next Saturday night's game which will have those are two teams that nobody wants to face in the playoffs Indianapolis would have won nine straight and these guys if they get in will be what people thought they were these guys right now as we see them tonight have to be the hottest team in the AFC and then you say you know what how about Indy there with Peyton Manning you have that factor there and you never want to go against that outside like it is not a that would be a first down and they've got a hot quarterback in rivers they've got well you know what if it's India against San Diego that's become some a rivalry and we've had a couple of their games on Sunday Night Football in the last couple of years and they have been tremendous right they match up well remember remember the last one where where San Diego goes down and scores and then they score too early and then right back down the field it right at the end of the game then in the playoffs last year and same they go led him to the room to the outside goes the pasture that is at the 28 yard line speaking of the wildcard playoffs next week the first game Atlanta goes to Arizona then it's the Colts ticking on the Broncos will the chargers right here on NBC football night will begin at 4 o'clock Eastern Time and of course we will have Super Bowl 43 from Tampa on February 1st there was funny you know frightening north turner he'd just come from a room where they were breaking down the indianapolis colts film already well they had to be breaking it down in Denver too but yeah yeah but I mean you know it's one of those things you think well you don't know if we're in yet you know and and you know after tonight whoever wins will start getting ready for the Indianapolis Colts that's not true they started getting ready through the Indianapolis Colts last week third down and seven under two to play in the third quarter moving backward throws and then spoils is able to avoid ones I got by Barrett before DJ Williams knocks him down and the Chargers will punt I was a thing on that screen pass the way you try and defend it as you try and get a guy outside and a guy inside and again straight up with the with a screen runner it's called a triangle you put a triangle around the guy carrying the screen Mike ciphers had a great year same being a really excelling on special teams of skulls and sacra's and Katie and kasym Osgood his first punt of the night will bounce out of bounds at the 25 yard line Cutler will go to work there LT me while going to the locker room 38 13 San Diego as the Denver Broncos coach and his team right now in dire straits down by 25 the ball at the 25 this is Marshall Marshall picks up the first down and gets taken down by little tripped up after he picks up 12 yards first down I think now he's going to be able to hit that underneath stuff because the the charges with this 38:13 lead are playing a softer defense or starting to play you know both safeties deep more no cover to shell and let them have that yep runs it that's a 12yard gain begin this time to the rookie Eddie Royal that takes it to the 50yard line and it's going to take us to the end of the third quarter so 15 minutes left in the season end of three San Diego 38 13 he sees Sunday night football from San Diego these messages from your local station Achan right now the Chargers in the driver's seat 38:13 we start the fourth quarter with a first intent to bender at the Braco 49 yard line Kotler feels low and incomplete second now let's go back to Tomlinson because l'Damian right now John is still back in the locker room and see if we can figure out what happened to him he goes down there at the 12 yard line and reaching for his groin and then he was trying to work out some stiffness there he was on the sidelines and they were looking at him yeah when you do that that is trying to try to loosen up with groin right there and second down and ten he can feel that pressure from behind gets away and somehow is able to thread it to Darrell Jackson for a first down boy Cutler could he could hear it 13 yard game they always say that quarterbacks have a clock in their head and they know that if I don't get rid of the ball by now I better get out of here right now that clock is telling him I better get out of here but the thing about Jay Cutler as you said he can he can thread the ball anywhere in the field when he always keeps looking upfield for a nine yard gain second down and one you know the way this thing is going you know and you Jay Cutler said last night I'm gonna have to throw 60 or 70 times he probably is going to clump close to throwing 60 times tonight 25 out of 38 at the moment for 237 but two picks and no touchdowns secondly one winds up in the hands of Bell first ever now you want to see a good player here watches Ryan Clady he's the rookie left tackle but he has great feet you know and that's what that's what a left tackle has to have he has to be like a basketball player he has to have feet and balance and this guy is super Adam he's one of the best rookie tackle that I've seen in the league in years pick in the first round out of Boise State Mike Shanin telling us last time he's kind of at this you might be good look not the clothes in the end zone for a touchdown by Shepler from out of the pocket Cutler throws a touchdown pass Scheffler with three touchdowns this season all against San Diego he beats Clinton Hart you see north turner is so upset one that they let cutler get out of there but they let they let Schaeffler come up with a big play because that's what he was worried about defense big plays in the passing game but again when you play jay cutler and as you say so so effective when he gets outside the pocket you have to keep them inside you have to keep them contained so Denver right now we'll go for two the only one they made was in a week and that won the game no matter what even if they make it it's still going to be a threepossession lead the San Diego Lily would be 17 or 19 cutter will try to run does he get there he does 2point conversion to successful to make it 38 to 21 so a 17 point San Diego with 13 minutes and one second left if the Chargers got in a and an onside prevent I don't think I would kick an onside kick but if they got it in a regular return I would try an onside kick here and the Chargers are kind of betwixt and between yeah they have seven guys within ten yards at the 50yard line it's a conventional kick it's taken by Scrolls and I suppose dissipates the 30 to the 34 yard line so let's see about that Bronco defense at a very critical point right now 38:21 a minute ago as he jogs back out onto the field did a report on his condition gates hasn't played me in the second half with an ankle injury and he's listed as questionable this is Darren Sproles for a gain of three you know and that's what Sproles likes he likes to run inside too you know we talked about not just being a third down back and he said every time he goes in there everyone yells screen screen screen and said he wants to do some of those things like that last play where he just ran straight ahead second and seven Chargers right now a little bit of clock milking this is a very big series for the Denver defense rivers so much the clock looking man this series is out of bounds at the 40yard line you're in the thing with with Phillip Rivers you can just see him he can't run a lick no he has no speed whatsoever so again all you have to do is move a little in that pocket buy a little time but you talk about the guy that really really struggles to run that's Phillip Rivers again he just he just quit looking downfield I mean he looked for a while it for a while so I'll go sugar by Brandon the guy can't get away in a dream during four winter says and who needs to run when you can throw like that as chambers makes a catch and a first down so they converted on the third and four chambers covered by Josh bill first down and covered with way too much cushion by Josh bill you wonder you wonder why you're off so much in this situation again he's reading the quarterback reading this brach waiting for him to look and set when Josh bell just getting way too much pushing on that I think somewhere here you know the Bronco do you think you have to press and you have to get up and you have to you have to stop soon you heard that the chart that doesn't let the not charge was they've been that's part of how the Chargers got their name Barron Hilton their original owner loved SC they've been doing that in Los Angeles for over 50 years and that was part of it also Baron hilt the original owner had carte blanche and there is Dean Spanos in the middle Aaron AJ Smith to camera right the general manager of the team being the son of Alex Spanish is now owned the team for 25 years speaking of Barron Hilton I ran into him at half time he's here tonight one of the founders of the American football I always always think that forgiving a lot of us out there in the world scroll is inside the 30 inside the 20 inside the 10 and forced out inside the 5yard line by Vernon Fox Mike Goff pulling and leading the way from white guard a 37 yard game yeah and that's why Darren Sproles can be in every down back because he gets in this situation Tomlinson hurt and and he can run the ball inside bouncing outside anytime you put the ball in his hand it can't go all the way and then this guy is something he's hard he's hard for the defense to see he gets in behind those linemen that he could make those quick cuts he is very very difficult to the fast first and goal and scrolls is able to force his way in for a touchdown scrolls toppers his way in with six Darren Sproles you know you got a package there and you know it's a special package first rushing touchdown by the Chargers that season scored by somebody other than Tomlinson I'll tell you he's low he's five foot six and then when he gets down and he gets down Lord he's about two foot two when he goes across that goal line made catering to the point after and so what was a critical series to the Bronco defense turns out to be a San Diego touchdown their defense can't slow up to San Diego offense well maybe they should have on site yeah 45 21 hole header here on NBC we know it's the Falcons at the Cardinals for starters and then the Colts either here or in Denver it all starts at four o'clock Eastern Time so late afternoon in the east and then the evening game will be Indianapolis at the chargers for the block O's 947 remaining in the fourth quarter Chad Jackson from the team and away from Osgood but not very far to the 22 yard line 9:40 remaining in the fourth quarter San Diego in control Philip Rivers making his sixth career start against Denver and a lot of success against the Broncos 38 points per game tonight they put 45 on the board leaving 45 21 with 940 funny how how much smarter Norv Turner got in December John oh he's brilliant tonight the charger fans were going crazy at the end of November 1 and everybody fired his play calling tonight strings up then get this Broncos defense on there he knows he's he's close to it's pointing to your oven week to week to the 33yard line charges as we mentioned 13 consecutive wins in December the Cowboys back in the late 60s and early 70s the charges right now on the cusp of making it 14 that's when you want to you know be your best at the end of the season and usually that team at the end of the season that is peaking as a team that goes with MRSA getting behind and then a flag comes down in fact there are two flags is one of the 50yard line and they just picked up one at the 34 yard line Chargers have had more defensive pass interference penalty is called on them than any team in the league this would be 13 if it is and you know they've given up a lot of big plays in their play both by the defense illegal contact number 31 that penalty has been declined pass interference number 28 that penalty would be accepted automatic first down illegal contact Cromartie and then the pass interference by Gregory you'll see 28 Steve Gregory he's right back here he's gonna there's there's the first one right there you see where he just grabs they're trying to be physical with Marshall and then Gregory I don't know that was close yeah you came across the bow and then the pass intended for Stokely is incomplete second down forty first pass maybe make it forty second thrown by Cutler tonight the Chargers if they win and they they play the Colts next week they're we're starting to get ready for their past offenses they are and Peyton Manning because they're going to they're going to see the same thing from Peyton Manning that they're seeing from Jay Cutler tonight second and ten groans it's a lawyer Sports Hill out of bounds at the 30 yard line you know in this thing when you loosen up on defense when you have a lead that's okay but you want to keep everything inside you know you'd like to keep the completions obviously in front of you but you would like to keep the receivers after they catch a ball we like to keep them in bound Brandon Marshall didn't even go to the huddle that time Sardi's third and five goes the other way and the pass is incomplete because part right into Schaeffler a shepherd accepted the ball totally fourth down and five they Cutler was saying that he wants to work in those safeties and he said anytime you see a safety with a neck roll on you want to work on and that's number 42 hi he gave a pretty good hit with that neck roll his head but because it was a defensive back with a neck roll that's the guy he want to throw on for them that was Chanukah Ben will live when the pass is too far for Brandon Marshall and there's a frustration of the way Denver's season appears to be winding up with Marshall you got a flag down because Marshall took the ball and flung it away so you gonna wind up with a penalty in the in the end zone that's the thing he's working on he's trying to you know control that temper he's trying to you know be better on and off the field and said he's working very hard at it but it's goin away from delay again spike as the player was a little wide open you see the it is not a frustration there I mean he was he was 10 yards open such a trip under his own feet he tripped on the end in San Diego once the ball flings it away but you had a change of possession here so there is no foul and first on for San Diego at the 30yard line and that's the thing when you when you have a game like this winner go on loser go home schools and especially in the case of the Denver Broncos I mean is sitting there with a threegame lead the final month of the season and now you're gonna go home and the San Diego Chargers who were without question the most starcrossed team in the league through the first three months this is a team that lost four games in the seconds there are the Broncos in the the only team as we say in first place by themselves the entire season that they lose tonight to not make the playoffs because of a loss in the last game first at the 40yard line how you started out at SIA end up isn't it Scrolls gaming of mine let's go to the sideline Andrew well finally some official word on the Danny and Tomlinson they're calling it a possible abdominal strain and they say they're being cautious which I think it's safe to say is a euphemism for between a 24point lead and a game to play next week he will not be back in the game but he's on the sidelines and he's stretching out that right side that right hip and groin area plenty of euphemisms when it comes to injury reports perfect description well especially when the team you're going to play is scouting you and you and watching every move you make here's Hester here to the 49yard line saw Tomlinson meanwhile Sproles tonight 13 carries 101 yards to captures 417 yards and runs back kicks and punts he's such a weapon for this team and that was one of the things we talked about earlier you know you talked about the charges very good offense defense not really good but dog on special teams are really excellent schools at 319 total yards or combined yards in the first game in the Tuesday let's go again to the 46 yard on the AFC playoff picture Baltimore winning today against Jacksonville that's cemented their playoff berth Miami beat the Jets Miami wins the East New England eleven wins not going to the playoffs Baltimore Miami Sunday Tennessee will face the lowest seeded team remaining Pittsburgh with Roethlisberger suffering a concussion today the number 2 seed and of course we have Indy against the way it looks right now San Diego next Saturday night second and eight at the 46 yard yes ester to the 44 and just to bring up to date in case you've been out all day and part of the evening in the NFC the Eagles killed the Cowboys today they go to the playoffs as the sixth seed they go to Minneapolis next Sunday Atlanta wins up five they go to Arizona the Giants have cemented the one seed last week they did that and Carolina wins today at the end over New Orleans to secure the number two seed there we talked about San Diego being that team that was come from behind that you really worry about you don't want to play now I think in the NFC that team would be the Philadelphia Weaver the way it's turned out especially at performance today stars to the 30 pretty good salary drive for him tonight huh I'll tell you and everything he does he's just so exciting I mean he gets it he gets the ball on the kick he's exciting he gets the screen he's exciting here he just gets a power play this is just a power oh right up right up through the five hole watch the right guard golf he's gonna pull make that block right there I'll tell you I mean they have they have this Bronco defense to feed it now they're not they're not putting up with a whole heck of a lot of fight 415 yards on the ground for spoilers faster he'll get dragged down he gets inside the 50inch still chugs along that and it's the biggest smile Tomlinson's had all seasons well you know because Hester was the tailback Hester played the same position as Tomlinson then they moved him to fullback and he was a backup fullback then he became the starting fullback now they get the lead and they put him back at tailback and he shows you how to run like a tailback and you go from Tomlinson to Darren Sproles to jacob Hester that's not a bad running combination of course you have to give the offensive line quite again I mean they have really they have really beaten down this Denver Bronco defense they have they have won we fight at the line of scrimmage all they like the team really come into their own or disappointment to the four seasons that have to pay attention and his subpar year Hester takes it to the seven and this the San Diego fan this is just delicious right now because the clock keeps ticking down the game is in hand you're going to the playoffs and as we've said at the very beginning from last rites to postseason right and you know who else is delicious for is the offensive line this is this is what you love when you when you've played the whole game and you have it under control and now you're just running out the clock you just running the ball right at them every offensive lineman in the history of the game loves this situation check in between we'll stop him at the 6 yard line and that is going to take us down barring a timeout Cole to the twominute warning two minutes remain until the San Diego Chargers start to get ready for the Indianapolis Colts 280th really suitable yeah I'll take the super but absolutely look at that second most in the history of a team but as we said before was founded in 1960 as the Los Angeles chargers at Barron Hilton these two teams both original members of the AFL third down and three testers aligned back with two minutes to go inside the fun I'm a little bit shy the first now this is deja vu unfortunately for Mike Shanahan the last time you had two teams fighting for a division title of the lose around with the playoffs on a game like this 1988 when Mike was the coach of the Los Angeles Raiders they met Chuck knocks his Seahawks at the LA Coliseum and Seattle won the game 4337 rather when you asked him if he remembered the last time that this happened he did remember and if you're one of those playoff games and you lose it you'll remember it for the rest of life because there's no game next week meanwhile here is Hester putting an exclamation point on a charger win i formation again lead power o.o guard pulls and leads but right now this charger offensive line has just taken over the game they're controlling the line of scrimmage and anyone or anything that they run in there's going to be a score big norm just get a bath over there ah extra point is good San Diego tonight has had the ball ten times they scored seven touchdowns have a field goal they're averaging six point nine nine yards are Rush and Kiki 491 yards and what a thank you they would like to send out to the Buffalo Bills of course with Buffalo beating Denver last week coming from the 13point deficit overcoming another Denver lead in the third quarter then enable the chargers who are flying back from Tampa and we're trying to keep track of this score they didn't get the game they don't like every other channel available to them on their charter but that game so they're looking at the scroll along the bottom on the various cable channels and that's how they found out tonight's game with me something when they get the final score against the old airplane erupted so what River says guys were throwing pillows at each other all kind of celebration that last week they did what they had to you know they went maybe Tampa Bay but bigger than that tonight they did what they had to do to get into playoff win their division get to play the Colts next week and what were the odds after that Atlanta loss on November 30th that north turner will be getting a Gatorade shower at 50 the one with his beyond like 600 the one I think okay you would have had to fill out a 1099 ring in the new year the TI Ludacris Diggy ferry like a little Times Square New Year's Eve countdown with Carson Daly nbc charges will win their third consecutive they have seen west championship I didn't do it the easy way this year loyal to the 42 yard line well you know what there's a parallel here in a way if you go back to Oh five with the Pittsburgh Steelers they had to win their last four regular season games and they did and then they won two other games on the road and then they went to Detroit and beat Seattle so they closed with the great eight and won the Superbowl right and that's what Sean Philips was saying the other day that you know this last month every game has been like a playoff game from can be playoffs with playoff type experience the last month and they needed help and they got the help they needed in Carolina beat Denver two weeks ago Buffalo upset Danville M Street for Peyton Manning and company to come in here next Saturday night Betty royal makes the catch and that's the way it's going to end with San Diego throwing up 52 points to beat Denver 52 to 21 not alert rivers well that's about the extent of that relationship but that figures to be a pretty good battle through the years LaDainian Tomlinson and Philip Rivers will be joining Andrea Cramer when we come back for the Wendy's postgame report on the other side of the break
