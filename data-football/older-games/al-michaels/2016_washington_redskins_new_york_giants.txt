============================================================

this is the kind of games you live for game there many soft that's why hear me it's bad here let's bowl all right well there you have it week 17 win and in but I guess it's not that simple right nothing can be that simple in the NFL I'm Jill buck along with the halloffamer Corey and win it in as long as there's no tie in Detroit tonight in that great game what should be in the battle for the NFC North so let's talk about the Washington Redskins if they get that victory they're in the tournament as they say what kind of a team is headed into that tournament with a win well we know if they have offensively there is good of an offense as I've seen you know all season long and the guy at the helm Kirk Cousins has had an outstanding year you talk about what this game means to the Redskins I think it means a lot to him to take this team to the playoffs two years in a row trying to secure a long longterm contract I think a lot is going to be determined for his future after the day's game yeah and let's talk about the Giants here now you can say oh well they're the number five seed doesn't matter what they do win lose draw whatever but they have some questions to be answered on offense I don't think they just mail this game in I don't think they can Joe there's a lot of people that say well what's one game gonna matter you know we're one half of football and this offense has got to play better if they're gonna have any chance when they get into the postseason defense is great I'm sure they're gonna rest a lot of guys as we move through this game it's an important ball game for the offense in Eli Manning say hi to Erin Andrews down on the field hi and as Troy just mentioned that one game means a lot to quarterback Eli Manning he told me there was zero conversation with his head coach Ben McAdoo this week about just how long he would play in this game he said there doesn't need to be a conversation the reason why he said I need some momentum into next week the postseason I know that my offense knows that and that's all I'm worried about him I worried about I asked if there was a certain area he wanted to concentrate on joke he told me well it's going to be fun to see just exactly how first year head coach Ben McAdoo approaches this game against a divisional rival and against a team that gave the Giants their only home loss of the season in week 3 her cousins will set it up at the 25 and here comes that gunslinger and a guy who loves the deep ball you know you talk about Sam Bradford today he set the NFL record for completions percentage but it's dink and Duncan short stuff Kirk Cousins is fun to watch because he wants to air it out and he's been doing it now for a couple years he's got a lot of guys there the ball out to some real threats that could get down the field certainly Deshawn Jackson not only does Kirk Cousins like to throw it down the field but Jay Gruden likes it as well my tooth Chicago last week and a big running game for the Redskins with a rushed for over 200 yards their second best day running the football this season he picks up just a yard you see where the Redskins ranked offensively in their total yards per game and maybe that last column is what we were just talking about the big plays the big chunks they're about as good as it gets in the NFL I got Jordan Reed he's back in the lineup after missing last week's game he's got the separated shoulder needed to take some time off it's good to see how he's able to play today there we go second and nine caught there he is makes a move gets away from one tackler and then he's brought down right at the marker went around jinora's Jenkins and that's a storyline because he's playing after sitting the last game out with the bad back that we saw him get injured at home against Detroit here's that Giants defense it's not only good with their numbers but peaking at the right time of the year they're terrific on third down as well they've been outstanding if someone would have said that they would do what they've been able to do this year that the Giants would run away with the division C on offense that is really surprised some people they're down in inches and off the edge it depends Calvin Shepard brings down Robert Kelly and Jean stare at or saunters over and looks in Jay Gruden and says you're this far short it's three and out to start the day what a play yeah Kelvin Shepherd he's able to just shoot through the line of scrimmage and Trent Williams a left tackle he's not able to get a block on him and a big stop there on third and short Redskins came into the game with a fewest three and outs around the NFL all year with just 20 that's their 21st and a punt from tres play good fine just outside the ten slits and then crosses the twenty and that's it Shay's our Everett will get credit for the tackle it's a ten yard return and it's a number ten it's twotime Super Bowl champion quarterback coming onto the field making his 199 consecutive start yeah there's something to be said for that that Eli man he's in the lineup each week that's that's an impressive run and we heard Erin Andrews his report that he wants to play and I think it's important this offense even though it has it's been a struggle throughout the season they're playing a defense that has not been good and this is an opportunity that for them to feel a little better about themselves is ahead in the next week's wildcard game delayed handoff to Perkins Paul Perkins is across the 20 for a gain of three Preston Smith on the tackle see the last nine games and where this Giants offense ranks and maybe with all those statistics you see and where they rank around the NFL over that stretch it's got to be most alarming simply the points I mean a man scored as many as 20 points over the last four games even last week when they had 470 yards of offense against the Eagles they still did score many points here's Perkins again with some room to run in front of him and a couple of strong carries first a threeyard gain now four yard gain its third and three coming up first Baker on the stop and this is a defense that if they get in will be tested to play well in the postseason they are the last ranked defense on third down third and three this is the matchup that everybody's been talking about right here the Josh Corman Odell Beckham expect to see that throughout this game on third down Pass is incomplete for Perkins and the two teams trait three announce to start the day one of those throws from Eli Manning here on the first third down of the game and they've got Paul Perkins thank he like gets through his progression well but he's got Perkins with an opportunity doesn't give him a good ball now Brad wing to punt with Crowder waiting the tough punt returner in the NFL Jamison from outside the Troy makes a crime how about number 80 finally forced out just shy of midfield by Bobby Rainey and Crowder who leads the NFL and punt return yardage average at over 13 as a 25 yarder good field position for Jay Gruden and his skins early no score hey everybody remember the great punt return we showed you going to break well they called a hold on 35 to Shawn Phillips a late flag that was thrown the announcement came during the commercial break so instead of starting at their own 48 because of the hold they started their own 14 and they don't normally call that too often loosely could get away with quite a bit on on the outside against those Gunners so a net results of 34 yards of field position and wall is back at the 14 yard line second possession for Kirk Cousins offense has been churning play action will start this Drive that solo is set and it's big Damon Harrison coming through loss of 10 are you going to see David Harrison he's able to work pass right guard Brandon sheriff and then he gets the straight shot on Kirk Cousins they putting in the extra offensive lineman ty in second at the tight end position trying to show heavy personnel a running personnel package take a shot off of playaction but Damon Harrison who's had a greater year in a guy who I really think got snubbed not making the Pro Bowl heck he was my vote as an allpro player he makes a big play so second and 20 nowhere fast Robert Kelley left side and there's Damon Harrison by the way you think there's any coincidence that Harrison leaves the Jets their defense goes down the tubes and he comes across town to the Giants and their defense is one of the best in the NFL one of the best against Iran like you said as the Jets were when he was playing for them and I'll be honest I thought he was going to be one of those guys that they would decide to rest along with generous Jenkins the fact that both those guys run the lineup playing here today I'm surprised that they're on the field great players they're down in 15 what a catch by Thompson if nothing else gets a little breathing room for tress weigh the punter is Devon Canard makes the stop again baby this guy's a really good weapon and coming off a big game at Chicago watch this grab he's a heck of a player he does a lot of different things for him and you know now another punt like you said earlier on that opening possession this is a Redskins team that they just don't get shut down very often and not moving the football but the Giants defensively they step up now here on the opening two possessions of the game way more Paris inside the 40 everybody in Landover Maryland was standing waiting for him to come out of a return of to carrier on the tackle on those four they've just had a great moment here at the stadium that will show you as we go through this first quarter it's America's game of the week and we have a moment here so we can tell you specialist Neal Watkins US Army currently stationed in Guantanamo Bay has been away from his family for nine months big Redskins fan his wife Jessica sons Lane and Landry first it was specialist Watkins on the video board saying hello to his family while his wife is fine holding her son specialist Watkins walked out and said you know what I'm just gonna do this in person you can see that little boy Landry I believe the younger of the two was pointing to the board there's daddy and he gets a big hug from Leo that was terrific second down and three after wilt I made the catch laid hand off Perkins right side first it the first first down of the game belongs to the Giants he not show on stop again afore Paul Perkins he's really gotten a lot of work here in the last three weeks he is lit the carries for the most part with Rashad Jennings since he's given them a little something that they've not had when he's had his opportunities and starts off that one with a pretty nice round of his own facing each other the bottom the screen get it away and hand off to Perkins nice move and there is no doubt Troy Aikman that Paul Perkins has taken the starting running back of this issue away from Rashad Jennings he just has more bursts and it's been that way for the last five six weeks and Larry Danelle he makes a nice block there on the outside you see there's no outside contain as Perkins hits it and I know in visiting with Ben McAdoo he feels the offense has shown some signs have been proven here in the last couple of weeks if only because they've been able to run the ball a little bit more effectively when he has said we got to keep from seeing the ball on the ground so much when we pass nearly picked and then Norman got hands to the face no flag the target was Shepard and Norman was staring at a walk to the end zone but Shepard broke it up because Norman has safety help so it's a rolled corner in Eli's trying to throw it into a roll corner against against Norman that's not that's not very good he's very fortunate not to have another interception Eli has struggled protecting the football here in the last four weeks he's turned it over eight times himself last month of the season 33 Perkins I saw it Josh Norman come away tapping at his facemask as he got this from Sterling Shepard no flag was thrown to first down here for the Giants I think sterling Shepard he does a nice job just trying to break that one up he gets the ball and then in the process hits the headgear I didn't think that was warranted to fly at the top of the screen delay hand on his Perkins Perkins inside the Swami down to the 15 will Blackmon on the stoppin in a game the Washington Redskins need to get into the playoffs they are watching the Giants move into scoring range well it's a couple runs now as Preston Smith he's getting blocked by Eric flowers in dookie Hanako he comes down at safety number 29 and he tries to fill the gap on the inside instead Perkins bounces it outside there's nobody there in a big game Jennings this first carry gets to who talked to Ben McAdoo during the week he said we're seeking consistency every week we're inventing new ways to make mistakes and put the ball on the ground 27 giveaways he talks a lot about protecting the Duke the Duke the name of the football that they have on it and said this time of year the football is like a bar at gold you got to protect it and they haven't that was a near pick moments ago from Manning and they've been on the ground one area never suits soon after Jennings and Jennings will take it down inside the tent after Preston Smith couldn't bring him down a gain of five you think about it Joe as good as the Giants have been on defense if this offense you know just protects the football when you're playing that good on the other side of the ball then you're gonna be a hard team to beat and and that's been true in a lot of ways I mean this offense as you said they have turned the ball over and I think sometimes everyone has to take a step back and realize this team has won eight of their last 10 games but for offense it has been the challenge all year long third down in free pass what catch by Shepherd Shepherd wasn't all the way around looking for the ball got to it with his eyes late and makes a four yard catch for a first down he just got his head around and is able to stick his arm he's had him he's had a heck of a year you know for a rookie I think in a lot of ways other than quarterback I think it's the hardest position to step in as a young player and play wow there's a lot to know especially as the slot receiver which is where he is here but he has been phenomenal and a good a good draft Nick by Jerry Reese on first and goal the kids nothing Adam Henry is the wide receivers coach for Ben McAdoo he's done a fantastic job obviously with Odell Beckham jr. and the threeyear run he's been on but as you say will you get sterling Shepherd you say well there's a good receiver secondround pick at Oklahoma he can run he's smart but how many guys have come out of college hide drafted that just can't just throw him out there and say go run by people it doesn't work that well now it doesn't and he's contributed he's second on the team in receptions and something he can really build on Manning to throw on second down and just throws it away and that's close to grounding yeah I don't think that got past the line of scrimmage they say now just in the vicinity but I wouldn't be surprised they're going to discuss it right now and you see Jay Gruden he wants the ball and you're asking me I think it should be called look like he was clearly in the pocket between the tackles and they're gonna throw the flag that'll be grounding you see that he's going to be within the tackle box and then you just got to get it past the line of scrimmage naughty not close intentional grounding offense quarterback was in the pocket under pressure and the forward pass did not make it back to the original line of scrimmage 10yard penalty loss of down fair down it's one of those situations where with with Eli they're their fourth in the league having given up just 21 sacks and a big part of that is because he will get the ball out it just won't take a sack and this time to get the call and Josh Norman gets ahold of the jersey they're on Odell Beckham so that's move the ball all the way back to the 14 third goal well trip throw over the middle well time takes it inside the five to the floor and it's sport down Compton on the stop and it'll be a Robbie gold field goal try who had his best game as a giant a week ago Thursday at Philadelphia when he went four for four I would think Joe Perry the defensive coordinator for the Redskins feels good about that that's an area where they have been they have struggled in terms of stopping people inside the red zone so they get the intentional grounding on Manning but the able to make a stop for some fill ball 22 yard try former colonel kick it through and so the first points belong to the Giants the drive stalls to freed up again look at the Washington Monument great time to be in our nation's capital weather is fantastic and on America's game of the week the Giants in a game that they don't necessarily need in a game the Washington Redskins do Giants have a three nothing lead Beckham going to go inside and get looked at for whatever reason and after a nifty catch by Sterling Shepard set up first and goal from the for the drive stalled for the Giants becomes Kirk Cousins third possession down by three well for the Giants they departed Newark Penn Station around 1:15 in the afternoon yesterday and arrived at Washington Union Station after having some fun as a group a lot of guys on a train trip train ride for the first time in their lives they got to Washington Union Station around 4:15 and that's rather routine for the Giants doing that the whistle stop tour but that's how they got to DC and they have a three nothing lead to 12 left in the opening quarter and the Redskins have it at the 25 start with it on the ground with celli and there's nothing out there Eli Apple the rookie was out there first and Landon Collins cleans up with the stop philosophy well the Redskins they bring Tyler in second again as the 6th offensive line 6th offensive lineman and Landon Collins he's able to get a push through Vernon Davis and Eli Apple who you talk about guys who have had really nice rookie season sterling Shepherd a wide receiver spot Eli Apple he's continually gotten better and has pretty much taken over as number two corner opposite of Norris James I ring up I do second down to 12 cousins throws has a man Garcon did he get both feet down the officials look at each other and say he did and after having their first backtoback three and outs to start a game all year they give their first first down and the Redskins are gonna hurry it up they see Kirk he's trying to get up there and get the ball he's been with the official he caught that ball no challenge back and he doesn't challenge much and Chris Thompson on a carry no game they're talking to Kirk Cousins trying to get him to slow down but the ball his feet are in but the ball was bobbled one more time see the umpire who's in the middle of that bar yeah cousins from getting under center you see the movement of the ball I think that was an incomplete pass and they had it the officials had a discussion with Kirk Cousins you can't put your hands on the official even if you're trying to eat the balls now it's another 20 plus yard completion as it is 23 yarder cousin swings inside no flag Deshawn Jackson was looking for one of those back shoulder throws and he got ripped down by Trevin Wade and looked to me when it happened that it should have been called there's an there's contact an arm bar and then as you get in front of the receiver and cut him off like that it very easily could have been called pass interference Deshawn Jackson was certainly looking forward and here's a guy who in Deshawn jackets Jackson the speculation as to whether or not he'll be back next year but over the last four or five ballgames he has been a big play machine looking for his fourth straight 100yard game that'll make it third down in 14 ball start offense number 88 fiveyard penalty third out Beckham's back and that's why he went inside he's got a cut or something on the little finger his left hand stirred down at 14 they're sewn by the way is knocking on the door of the second 1000 yard season as a Washington Redskin also a free agent to be and he wasn't alone Olivier Vernon was there as well and it's fourth down we've seen Steve spagnolo bring the pressure now a couple times with Landon College you see him drop here but Vernon he's working against in second he's able to get the pressure initially Collins just jumps over Chris Thompson who is a really good pass protector at that running back position but Collins has been outstanding around the line of scrimmage all year he's a good Blitzer he's had a Pro Bowl year third punt already for tres way it's the final play of the opening Harris back to the 15 across the 25 Landon Collins what a year Olivier Vernon what a year and they combined to bring down cousins America's game of the week with his massive play Call Sheet Ben McAdoo looked it over he becomes a fourth coach in Giants franchise history first of all in ten or more games in his first season and secondly to get to the playoffs in his first season Giants coming off backtoback six and 10 years that spelled the end of the road for Tom Coughlin here's one Beckham he's back and he's across the 40 Dean of 15 that's Beckham's first completion of the reception of the game and Josh Norman they're playing soft and I know in visiting with Josh Norman he says that he likes to get on the line of scrimmage and gets hands on the receivers and nobody's going to mix it up at times and sometimes he's going to be soft he's not always in man coverage even when he's opposite of Odell Beckham but this time he's up on the lines it's Jennings the arms of Mason Foster who's the top tackler for the Redskins will be second down meanwhile before the game this kid Bennie junior with the good hair was was out and on display and Ben McAdoo found out about it and came out to get a highfive grace he's still got it going err cut that in for Chris Christie criticized on boomer and carton this week second and six news Jennings gain of just two third down coming up you think back to the preseason and when the year began I know going into week one that we look at that call sheet there was some talk that maybe been maknoon would even call place they were throughout the preseason he calls them some and then he he gave some of it up to Mike Sullivan as well to call some of those plays and then he decided that he was going to keep those responsibilities but I don't know that it's something that he's always you see the menu that he has to Paul plays off of find something to this offense go blitz Giants pick it up and there goes Odell Beckham out at the 41 and he's working on Josh Norman and those two have a little moment on the sideline a gain of 12 and a first down an excellent job by Rashad Jennings he's able to come up block Mason Foster in the hole and you see the man coverage by Josh Norman and you allow Odell Beckham to just run the shallow crossing route it's hard to keep pace with the big third down pickup with L Beckham has a shot at the receiving yardage title this year trailing T Y Hill watches jokes and with that carry by Rashad 4:6 we go to charissa with a game break thanks Joe late first Atlanta up 7:30 Devonta Freeman goes to a 75 yard run the longest of his career and with the win Atlanta locks in that 2 seed and the by the Saints are in the red zone right now but Atlanta up 14 3 Joe Toye there keep an eye on that game Matt Ryan who could very well be the MVP dangerous second and four here's James and with under 12 to go in the opening half trend Murphy makes a stop a gain of tune third down and short coming up for New York see Odell Beckham at times Hill line up in the in the slide and Josh Norman at times when when he's in man coverage he'll definitely be lined up across from them but if he's not then that means they're in zone coverage they're at the top of the screen on Odell Beckham down into protected finds his gun and it's the rookie Shepherd another third down conversion for the Giants a gain of 14 and initially this is where Eli Manning was looking he took a shot he sees that norman bales doesn't have a shot down the field to beckham and then sterling Shepherd he works the middle of the field and Eli does an excellent job coming back to his second receiver and picking it up twice we've seen a player lose his footing on this surface here at FedEx Field first down handoff and Rashad Jennings will take it inches outside the 15 for 4 Ziggy hood on the stuff de Groot who was in his third season as the Washington Redskins head coaches see the overall record but they were the division champs a year ago trying to go to the playoffs and backtoback years for the first time since the early 90s second and six here we go again it's Norman against Beckham round three and this time the flags on Norman Lautrec polly laid him out of bowels defense number 24 half the distance to the goal first out that right there was a play earlier that's another punch at the football they had a moment here on the sideline prior to that last third down conversion a little shop as they were going back into their respective Huddle's and now that little punch missed the ball and caught Beckham in the stomach it's a flag to bring it down inside the five keep an eye on the two of those right now and we see both of these guys highly competitive we know what the battle has been that altercation on the sidelines in the here on this play second time to Johnson at first and goal of before the selfie Jimmie's takes it inside the Ricki jeanfrancois on the stuff right now I mean Jay Gruden's got to be a little bit concerned this has been all New York Giants here in this first half and the Giants with a chance to extend their lead to ten nothing and I know you know all of us coming into the game you don't know what exactly to expect from the Giants but they are playing football Jennings for the touchdown an impressive start for New York here against a divisional rival and for Rashad Jennings he gets his third rushing touchdown in the season and for the Giants they get only their 6th all year Westin Richburg EES he's the guy that kind of run right between him and the and the right guard on Jerry and finished off a nice Drive and there's those two going at it again the officials talked to him before the game began and you see them coming over again to try to separate the two zayats last in the league in rushing touchdowns get their 6th and lead by 10 so what's on the line a playoff spot for the Washington Redskins not a good start 10 nothing New York it's great battles over the years between these two terrific franchises Giants have had the most recent success as you know that won four Super Bowls overall but they won at the end of the 2007 season at the end of the 2011 season and by the way both those years they had to go through Green Bay at Green Bay to get there and win at all and they may have to do that again we'll get into that as this game goes forward Redskins looking for something offensively started at 25 as they trailed by 10 what scores surprises you the most this one on America's game of the week 10 nothing Giants with the Giants nothing on the line and everything in front of the Washington Redskins or what's going on with Seattle and the 49ers with all the unrest with the San Francisco organization it's a 143 fortyniner lead in that game over seattle there's a chance that seattle slides down to the number four spot in the winter the NFC North goes up to the number three spot and I don't think anybody saw that coming on a day where Trent Baalke their GM's been fired and Chip Kelly their head coach has a meeting with ownership after the game that will determine his fate and here they are leading the Seattle Seahawks second and five cousins protected heirs of Garcon and there's generous Jenkins downfield coming off the back end jury and able to pop up good to see him back take a look Pierre Garcon is an excellent intermediate route runner is also a guy who's given them some big playability down the field just a ball that's not out to the sidelines so Jenkins able to get on it you know hey I'm surprised by what's happening between that Seattle and San Francisco teams but looking at this one here Joe you never really know exactly what you're going to get when you're the Redskins coming in against the Giants and Giants are playing all their guys jinora jenkins who made the play on the last ball he's playing with a bad back and there he is landing on it may have held this offense in check in the first map dozens fires a fastball to jordan rain who slides down at the Giants 49 a completion of 21 it's the first one that we've seen Kirk Cousins really being able just turn loose and Jordan Reed they split him out he finds the hole in the zone and her cousin on time it's the ball and they desperately needed that to get this thing going Reed has missed his choice said not just last week's game but through the last four with that bad shoulder what a weapon he is cousins there he is again to the right he dives forward inside the 45 gain of five as we talked about he did miss last week's game but he probably should have missed a couple of others he's got two separated shoulder he this was not able to function it wasn't able to block and basically trying to do it with one arm and trying to get him as healthy as they can you know for this game and rested him last week and knowing what's at stake today but this is a different offense when he's on the field what are they Shelly robert kelly who has taken over the top running back spot for Jay Gruden is good for three third and short coming the run game I think when you when you talk about the Redskins and what they've been able to do overall this season running the football as you see the total yards by the Redskins just over 50 yards this is a this is an offense at eight times this season at over 400 yards of offense and three times had over 500 yards so this is rare territory for them to not have more success they've had here in this first half moving the football they're down in two cousins not on the same page with Jordan read and the drive hits a wall here as the punt team comes on on fourth down for Jay Gruden that sure looked by Reid's reaction after this play that you know he well he just lost his footing as as he was coming out but I don't know if he was going to continue on the go route or come underneath but until that Reid was frustrated with it and missed opportunity and a stop for the New York Times press Way has one pass completion this year that was a 31 yarder at the and a twopoint win for Washington the only home loss to the Giants this season York has the ball and a 10point lead six and a half left first the world number 80 is frustrated for last week had a legitimate shot at a 1000 yard season and one catch for three yards at Chicago show you what happened Paul Perkins gets sip and let's go back to the third and to look well the Giants they bring the pressure off the slide and so Crowder he's just oneonone that on land and Palin certainly picks up the first down and Kirk Cousins just working opposite of that but as this game moves along they're down ten points and and you start pressing a little bit when you know what's at stake and you got to win this game to have a chance and in all likelihood you win this game here in the playoffs I they did not expect to come out here and struggle the way that they have offensively the Giants this has been a nice performance for them and like I said you never know what you're going to get out of them already clinching the five seed but they've shown some good things hyah Knight is trying to rip the ball out of there makes to stop the gain of six aaron what's going on down there redskins receivers just clearly frustrated yet Jameson Crowder come off that field just shaking his head to Sean Jackson with his hands on his hips kind of coming over Jordan Reed saying what's going on what's the problem Reed talking to himself on the bench yeah the mood not great down here I know you well enough to know you Ben McAdoo is going about this game for the Giants they absolutely do and I think it was important for this offense and I think they have you know they've shown some real positive things which was important they did not play well their last out and against the Eagles even though they were able to clinch a playoff berth with the loss by campus delay a game unless they're going to claim they threw the flag unless they're going to claim the sideline got a timeout as Eli Manning left the play clock wind down crowd to the delay of game the head coach in the New York Giants calling timeout will be their first timeout McAdoo sought Eli did not timeout third down when we come back the big third down for this Washington defense third down and four Giants for the ball at their 15 man we'll tie the tie Dan great block from Cruz Victor Cruz just carried his man downfield and opened up a mile of grass for wilt I good for 24 will will Compton he's the one who's going to be in coverage and then he gets caught up with the slant routes in behind it it opens up will tie for an easy completion and then Victor Cruz as you said he does an excellent job helping out down the field the Giants have been really good here in this first half on third down a lot of things getting better offensively and the Redskins been the perfect defense for that to happen charissa Thompson gamebreaker things show always a highscoring game when these two teams get together back Brian Julio Jones 41 yard score and I remember all Falcons have to do is win to clinch the to see they're up 21 to 10 Joe Toye their if the Seahawks lose at San Francisco opportunity for innovation north to slide up and the Giants would end up playing in Seattle Perkins third and eighth coming up talk about the third downs that the the Giants have been able to convert this is they've had a bunch of third and four and third and less and we got a Ryan Kerrigan who's down and obviously he's a big part of this defense if you look at the numbers for Eli Manning on third down its third and eighth he's been good and that's been a problem for New York yeah he has been good it's been a problem for the Redskins all year their last in the league on third down and they've given up a lot of third and long over the course of this year fourth as well we've got the Giants here at third and ten third and eight sure they make a stop they need one Compton booth got up and got off the field easily passed clockwise Shepard another third down conversion for Eli Manning but a flag is down back in the area where Manning was protected it makes you think initially of a hold and we'll see if that's the call jeans stare at or in a conference to make sure it's a hands to the face against the giant illegal use of hands hands to the face offense number 73 10yard penalty replay third down they call it on Marshall Newhouse he's working against Ryan Kerrigan there and then on the other side you got Eric flowers who he's back in Eli's lap at the left tackle position and something Eli's had to get used to all season long one of those tackles is basically been in his face just about every time he's thrown the ball this season papi parked the starting right tackle out with a forearm so Newhouse gets his third started right tackle guilty the hands to the face its third and 18 delayed handoff Perkins fourth down well because of the penalty then on Marshall Newhouse they're able to force a punt and now give the ball back to their offense and this is a Redskins team member back to week three it was a mustwin game that week and they were down 12 points at one point in that one it's funny think all the way back to week 3 and that's really what it felt like Redskins were open to got a big there's Crowder his dent in this game returning punts a 45yard punt Louis on the tackle in a return of 10 yards Wednesday night it's a huge college hoops showdown on fs1 to the best of the Big East battle win Josh heart leads top ranked Villanova against number 13 Butler action tips off wednesday at 6:30 Eastern on FS 1 the reigning National Champion Villanova Club and here's the penalty on Marshall Newhouse that took the first down away you see the right hand clearly to ryan Kerrigan's base and after converting on a third and eight they're able to get off the field and now it's time to see if the Redskins offensively could put something together mr. Kelly excited want to play by Casillas a twotime Super Bowl champion Jonathan Casillas who actually talked to the team during the week not to fire up his team in a game that didn't have playoff implications he knows what it takes to win it all and he made the big hit him yeah well you talked about how good this run defense has been for the Giants this year and the Redskins have had a hard time here in the first 30 minutes getting anything going on the ground game we're at the twominute warning so forget the bad snap it'll be second down and eight on the other side of the break two minutes left in the first half minute 55 will be changed cheer the Washington Redskins were shut out in a half of football but good this offense has been cousins came into this game still has it with a shot at a 5,000 yard passing CJ that it's been Giants defense book in the story in the first day of second and eight and traffic Chris Thompson third down coming up this Giants defense just swarms to the football now they're gonna say incomplete as an official comes in and over rules the other let's take a look at it and see what that man saw that the other man didn't and that's the right call third and eight this this offense has just been off a little bit so much of what they've been able to do this year is get the big plays down the field and quite honestly as good as the Giants have been all year they have been prone to give up some big plays in the passing game Redskins have taken their shots you just haven't been able to hit them blitz cousins down he goes Dominique Rodgers Cromartie what a time for his first sack of the year that he comes off the edge and Kirk Cousins never feels in common doesn't see it I'm not sure anybody did Jamison Crowder is working in the slot he didn't look like he was running any kind of hot route either but this defense played outstanding they're shutting down one of the best offenses in all football here in this first half tres way who's been busy he doesn't punt much fewest around the NFL coming in will welcome you inside the booth is the Giants have called a timeout hoping to get the ball back would have some time to add to their 10 nothing lead this is impressive by New York and really disappointing for the Washington Redskin I think the Redskins are a little bit stunted you know by what's happened here and the Giants you know like I said you don't know exactly what's going to happen you know Ben McAdoo talked about playing his guys he's done that they've played well eris waits for it just inside the 30 that's Duke eeeh nacho we'll take a break Giants will have it we'll come right back in 30 seconds America's game of the week dying to try to add to a tenpoint lead second in short hand the high drive Craven the call this is a four yard run it may not look like much but it forced Carolina to respect the ground game which sucked up the safety on his playaction one of the most prolific performances in NFL history starting an extraordinary run that may playoff time in Georgia a little more peachy so this isn't just a four yard run it can be a Super Bowl run you look at the quarterback comparison and Troy you said this coming in and I agree we will for Kirk Cousins this is opportunity he's under a franchise tag this year at around 19 million they could franchise him again next year at about 24 million they could sign them to a longterm deal or they could let him walk away I don't expect that to happen because he's been so good but these are the games that you gotta win I mean this is what defines you know what you are as a quarterback and how a franchise gives you I think as a fourthround pick he's constantly constantly been having to to prove himself and overcome his draft status there's no doubt that had he a been a top pick that he would have been signed to a longterm deal you know last year coming into this season but there is a lot of pressure on him I think there's a lot of pressure on this team right now to come out win this game and give themselves a chance heading into the playoffs but the Giants have come out and stunned them this has not been the offense of the Redskins that we've been used to seeing all year this is a Redskins team that's setting offensive records not just cousins the franchise record 4630 passing yards coming in but they have the top yards per game average in franchise history at over a 410 a game look good so far today but a lot of time left guys trying to head to the 10th Waterloo makes the catch and a gain of three you start to look at and you wonder just how much is Eli Manning going to play in the second half will he play in the second half but offensively looking at it they're close to 200 yards here in this first half been a good performance wide open receiver and it's Beckham Gorman gives him the tug not of bounds a gain of eight the first down and we've seen that a lot with wide receivers whether it's Ben Shephard a Beckham they've been not just opened wide open though Odell Beckham has such great speed and quickness that you see when he starts to threaten even a guy as great as Josh Norman up the field and you're able to come back the way that he did you created a lot of separation to make it easy on your quarterback threeman pass rush Manning underneath and there's Beckham again and he gives a stiff arm into the chest of the shot Breeland and with under a minute to go and one timeout left to gain of two hello Dell Beckham had 120 yards receiving in the first meeting between these two teams and see Beckham hold the ball you we've watched that really throughout this two kids pretty good loose he lose with that football once he has it he's had a nice first half second and eight satellite overshoots Victor Cruz who's kind of been the forgotten man in the Giants offense he's had to go to the outside as the rookie sterling Shepard goes to the slot on the inside that is where Victor Cruz became a propyl receiver well now the Redskins they've got the Giants backed up again at third and eighth and can they make a stop they didn't the last time it was third and eight they were able to get another chance with the penalty they've given up a lot of 13 Long's this year Flitz Giants pick it up Manning miss communicate the questions coming in for the Giants where how long would they go with Eli Manning he's obviously going to play the first half but what will the giant personnel look like on the field for Ben McAdoo in the second half and here the Washington Redskins you're hoping the substitutions start coming fast and furious especially on defense yeah no kidding but I like what I've seen from Eli here in this first half and the offense and I would think that if they decide not to play him you know this was a positive thing they were able to get a little bit breaks through one tackle back down near the 28th let's find out what's coming up at halftime and say hi to Curt once again coming up on the VESA halftime earlier today New England wrapped up the AFC's home field advantage meanwhile Oakland is playing right now so is Kansas City both those teams trying to be the number two seeds in the playoffs join me and me for the VESA halftime report all right well yeah there are at least seedings who left to be determined in the AFC in a spot to be determined in the NFC the offense 49 total yards this has just been a shuttle but it's a 10point game we took pouch and a timeout taken by the Giants on defense they are out time out go back to week three the last meeting between these two had a little bit of everything hard hits a nice fake punt good throw by tres way the catches of course it's Beckham late hits on and off the field that's where the old kicking met and Odell Beckham became acquainted and then it was a sua Cravens interception that in essence ended the game look at the comparison then and now defense as ruled today at first Game five second half lead changes in the 29:27 win for Washington to go to one and to the 27 Thompson survives a hit almost lost the ball got back on it was generous Jenkins is the one who stopped him clock runs a gain of one low surprised that her cousins doesn't use the timeout there a lot of wasted time off his clock or Jay Gruden on the sidelines so it's a completion for a first down but so what now they're only eight seconds left you saw the Sean Jackson get run into by Jameson Crowder and he was slow to get up but why the Redskins didn't use a timeout after that completion a moment ago I don't know but now only eight seconds remain two timeouts three timeouts left after the ball was caught and the clock was running I was shocked that they didn't burn it immediately ended up just this clock running down and try to regroup there at halftime and see if they can't get something going in the second now nothing forward to Sean Jackson in the opening half one point left there you go to the 40 get a timeout before the end of the half right now the clock shows zeroes but a timeout was called Washington it is a 30second timeout and they will get it you're looking at 57yard tribe by Dustin Hopkins that would be a careerlong well they got a shot and it was smart by DeSean Jackson understanding the situation with little time on the clock that he didn't have time to try to get any more yards than that he was the clock was going to run out and he was able to get on the ground they get the timeout we'll see what happens here on this attempt but not calling timeout after that first completion has cost them more of an opportunity of something within reasonable range again this would be a career long for Dustin Hopkins who's had a good year on one hand he's made 33 field goals but he has missed 7g Norris Jenkins will go back to return it in case it's well short so no timeout taken early in that drive my cousins are Jay Gruden and that cost them a chance at a more realistic field goal Redskin shutout down by 10 Curtin the guys it's all yours but 57 yard field goal try so it's a 10 nothing game 83 total yards for the Redskins on offense nobody saw that coming Giants will started 225 and we will start with Erin Andrews down on the field Jay not James folk would take root and Joe attend nothing game but standing outside of Washington locker room you'd think it was 20 nothing guys had their heads down they were talking to themselves kind of looking at me rolling their eyes shaking their heads I asked Jay Gruden where did he begin with his team at the half and he just kind of chopped chuckled and said look we have 30 minutes left and if we don't turn it around the season's over we need to pull our heads out of our he feels like they have not been physical enough on offense they've been soft on D and they need to pick it up yeah it's a 10point game it doesn't feel like it but it's just a 10point game the giant start with Perkins big holes to run through for these Giants running backs he gets seven to start the second half pretty good start for Paul Perkins here in this second half and true to form here in the last month he's got the most carries between him and Rashad Jennings in that first half and like I said he really does give them something and I think if you look at the last couple of games for this Giants offense when they have started to run the ball better a lot of those runs have come between the tackles and and that's where Perkins hits it on first down fake toss and they handed to Perkins and picks up the first down the Redskins defense has to get a little more inspired here a gain of five we have the cameras focused in on these two guys and we saw it with Carolina and the Giants last year we saw earlier in the year and week three Norman picked up Beckham early in that game Norman's been flagged unnecessary roughness in this game right in his face to start the play nacho can't bring him down until he gets to the 45 and a flag is down they threw the flag this time it might be on Josh Norman but that's where the flag was thrown they go after each other again you see Norman come in having to display here right there the initial contact was fine it was that second shot by Norman personal defense number 20 Josh norman's got to be happy Jean stared tours mike is cutting out because before the game he was talking to norman bought this stuff and let's say this about Odell Beckham we saw that stuff gone on go on last year when Norman was with Carolina I thought Beckham was the aggressor and a lot of that head to head stuff with Josh Norman and earlier in the year we've seen Beckham loses cool a couple of times in that fight with a kicking that and then he lost his cool with a game at Minnesota but Beckham is keeping his calm here and he's getting the better of Josh normal yes he is and Josh Norman said the other day that you know he does not initiate the talk produce two flags on Norman another flag comes down here at the 41yard line as Perkins carries a file for seven and Carrigan comes out hurt his left elbow last week in Chicago now it's his right hand number 84 we play first stop that's a mold on Larry to now and you see the frustration by Jay Gruden and to go back Josh Norman says he does not initiate the talking but if a receiver engages with him then he's more than willing to comply and yet I don't know about anyone else I get tired of watching it each and every week or whenever these two guys meet but here you're on a team who's trying to win to find a way to get in you can't have penalties like he had that bastard football team across from each other this time the toss to Perkins running right through Washington on first and 20 Paul Perkins over the left side picks up 13 yards Weston Richburg the center he's been one of the real constants for this offense this year along that offensive line you see the job that he does blocking and Odell Beckham on the outside you know he's doing a heck of a job blocking Greg Toller and they continue again in this game to get some production out of the running game third or fourth week now that they've shown some real positive signs Norman Beckham across from each other passes caught first Shepard as he works against Toller in case you're wondering who the backup quarterback is for the Giants it's Josh Johnson Ryan Nassif went on IR last week with a bad elbow so Josh Johnson who was picked up right before the start of the regular season would get the call and that's his last pass attempt in 2011 should he take over his over five years ago when he threw his last on more regular season pass I'm sure he would love to get on the field his Jennings and coming down out on the play closing down on a Dookie a nacho a gain of five this is really something to watch the way the Giants have controlled this game see a lot of life out of this Redskins team the play selection I guess you kind of expected that a the Giants want to continue with their running game and build on what they been able to accomplish the last couple of weeks be they want to keep Eli Manning out of harm's way there's another Carey Jennings on second and five third and short coming up with the Giants are inside field goal range and now Josh a Ryan Kerrigan rather is being led off the field as he continues to hold that right hand up in the air let's say this if the Washington Redskins lose this game the game tonight between the top two in the NFC North determines who wins the division but the losers in Tampa Bay was the only team that had a shot at a playoff spot and opportunity is gone third down and three Perkins on a toss running left Boston made the play and its fourth down are they trying to get the ball to Perkins to pick up this first down on the sweep and boy Mason Foster is able to shoot the captain and make a play they get a little help that puts a muchneeded stop but where the Giants are they're going for it on fourth down fourth down and two Masha's sketched Bob Foster who's leading his team with 12 tackles on the day and now he gets a big tip on Ford than two Redskins take over still downtown can be back to Landover Maryland and you can see the field judge going over and talking to Odell Beckham and Beckham is completely kept his cool while Norman has been flagged twice for more than head to head stuff that we've become accustomed to unfortunately here between those two play action from Cousins is this the time the Redskins get it going Jensen overthrown second down in ten fen McAdoo the head coach of the Giants talked about as you watch they hit that Cousins takes at the end of this from Vernon then McAdoo when asked about playing as regulars in this game said we want to be a physical heavyhanded tough road team because their trip what they hope will be Super Bowl 50 one in Houston will be a road trip second in law that is took Damon Harrison off the field but he was in there on first down as was Olivia Burnett as we saw with the pressure on time sent out to his right Eli Apple with a play third down and ten coming up I really think all these corners to Norris Jenkins Dominique Rodgers Pro Marty and now the rookie Eli Apple you know we talked about their abilities to cover and they do an excellent job this past defenses is really terrific when you're able to cover with those type of guys but they're also very physical in the run game they're down in 10 and another sack of cousins Leon Hall was in there and was not alone spagnolo fired up and the Redskins offense is in reverse you seen Leon Hall he comes up and then Landon Collins he brings the Blitz Steve spagnolo when you've got those kinds of corners as I was talking about it also affords you the ability to bring guys inside on the pressure packages and get home and another three and out for the Washington Redskins zone Arius at the 45 to midfield that's it happy man Steve Spagnola told us during the week I've been watching for guys tuning out in meetings I haven't seen him we have to continue to play well his group has when Harris is injured it was on the punt return he kept fighting for extra yardage you can see that ahold of his legs the shoes are Evert it was the left knee they were checking when he got up and went to the sideline he is a high price special team terrific player just returning kicks but covering kicks the pole balls and special teams flare is a viable guy on those special teams units left a lot behind Eric flowers their big left tackle who has said a hitormiss year been under a lot of fire the first round pick out of Miami last year it's been really a tough year for Eric flowers over there left tackle throughout the season and struggled in pass protection but this running game has really helped by Manning you know try to find at least some balance and not having to do it all himself and it also helps us offensive line not to constantly be having to be in pass protection as they were last week Manning gets rather good flag is thrown for a hole that appears heavy pressure by Preston Smith and here's who said they hit or miss here's the missed part holding offense number 74 10yard penalty replay second down that's his ninth offensive hold of the year you just don't see been magnitude given much help either and he has needed it but you see him he gets off balance and whenever you get your feet out of position and then you get beat you start grabbing and that's when he gets called for those holding penalties and John Jerry over there getting checked out on the sidelines as is Dwayne Harris good to see him up but at least moving around they look that great trying to do it second and 16 now for the Giants who lead by 10 and off to Jennings nothing there Chris baekho's there was Ziggy hood gain of a few third down and long coming up and keep waiting around to find what will light the fire for the Washington Redskins well you know here they are 30 long the Giants are so we'll see if they can make a stop the Redskins on third and long but you thought that well you know maybe that decision by Ben McAdoo would create a spark on fourth down when they made the defensive stop and the offense goes out and freeing out beg them not out there Tavares K is this is close and nowhere to go Greenland on the stop and it's fourth down for the Giants who will punt with the dangerous Jameson Crowder heading back to returning well Joe Barry's got to be very pleased with that defensive stop because the Giants once again to start this Drive they were in midfield that excellent field position did not give up any points that's big basically didn't give up any yards yeah when to punt Arush by the Redskins they don't get there let's it go zone it checked up for a moment and then ended up in the edge zone two time special teams player the week Brad weighing almost pinned the Redskins team 10 nothing game with Washington offense after 20 after the punt by Brad wing like the 73 total yards of offense for Washington bounce it and turn it a nice run on first down he gets seven look at this Redskins offense Joe as you see what has happened in this game today and they came into this game six guys on this Redskins offense with 44 more receptions the only team in the league they could say that and Jordan Reed said it three receptions bird but there's no wide receiver that's had more than one record so far nothing for Kelly gets maybe a yard and it'll bring up third and two Olivier Vernon on the stop so you see names like Vernon out there Harris and Hankins all out there for the Giants the only guy that we haven't seen the last couple of possessions for Washington has been generous jenkins on the defensive side the giant you take to norris jenkins out then you replace him with Dominique Rodgers Cromartie so you think well maybe then you can go after that guy DRC he has got a resume of his own one four seven on third down this is a heave for a first down Garcon a nice move still going there's life for the Redskins down inside the 25 that's an excellent route by Pierre Garcon to the corner but Kirk Cousins he is under pressure Olivier Vernon he gets an inside rush and he is right in the face of Kurt cousins and Kirk has to kind of give some ground just to give him a chance and get the ball out he lays it out perfectly and that's exactly what this Redskins offense needs 49 yard completion and now over 1,000 yards again Asgar son he is tough always has been play action cousins receivers fell down and DRC with a pet back the other way was Maurice Harris who lost his footing and for Dominique Rodgers Cromartie his fifth pick of the year so after the 49yard er here's Harris down he goes it's just a gang who's caught seven balls all season long and let's take a look at see if Rogers Cromartie gets his feet down there's the right foot left toe drags but cousins turns that loose Harris goes down Missy Crowder up in the seam and he's thinking maybe he had a chance Andrew Adams a safety he's working that way but Harris falling down is costly and the Giants are back in business how about Dominique Rodgers Cromartie with a sack his first two the year now his fifth pick and his 29th career interception and he had to get both feet down like a receiver to secure the interception they looked at it and turn over play so it got reviewed and it was a clean pick by number 41 Kirk Cousins was talking about Dominique Rodgers Cromartie on Friday and saying how much respect he had for now Tuffy is to throw the football against he went to the right guy with the football even though Maurice Harris is this guy who is limited catches this season he just simply falls down in DRC makes a good play on the ball Jennings were the carry of one Gerry Reece seemingly has been under fire since he took over certainly the last few years made the big free agent signings in the big splash he's the general manager of the Giants on March 10 adding Jenkins Harrison Olivia Gordon Pitt drafted well and signed very good college free agents for wilt I covered by Compton and so that combination talking about Eli Apple who was their firstround pick Romeo o para who was a free agent Admiral Andrew Adams who was a free agent added at safety and then the drafting of Sterling Shepherd it's been a real good body of work here over the last year for Jerry Reese and I think the most impressive part a lot of times you go out in free agency and spend the kind of money like the Chinese did it doesn't get you very far and Redskins fans know all too well about that all three of those guys Olivier Vernon Doris Jenkins Damon Harrison have been outstanding this year third nine in there Ronnie another stylist Redskins defense and making the play Trent Murphy Ryan Kerrigan left with a finger injury his return is questionable but they have some good players to fill in and that time Murphy made the play for defensive coordinator Jill berry and now two players are back will Blackmon and Jameson Crowder who's the Redskins look for kick start here on special teams and Dwayne Harris is back in the game for the Giants it's great to see its Crowder 35 good move down the sideline and he gets popped by Zach deeossie 54yard punt and a 17 yard return tempers flare between divisional rivals Jay Gruden needs a win his club is in downtown good we saw one series and he not only took Dallas down the field but look good doing it threw a touchdown pass to Terrence Williams that was his only series so he kept in the one series and look sharp threw a touchdown pass and then his afternoon was over and they handed it off to Mark Sanchez Olivier Vernon is not out there for the Giants carry win and Laura are the defensive ends playaction cousins sideline inbounds is Vernon Davis the back judge came flying up and said the catch was good let's take a look what a beautiful effort by Vernon Davis I didn't think there was any way he was in bounds when it happened Vernon Davis he starts in around the line of scrimmage take a look at and see if his heels looks good the left heel was in play but he starts inside and then he runs the wheel route and he shows some of the speed and athleticism that he still has at his age to Kelly he smacks it in there again of the garden of house Vernon Davis is one of the eight players with over 500 yards from scrimmage on this Washington offense that's tied for the most alltime or the 2011 Saints it's why typically Washington so dangerous because they can get you from so many different angles yeah well when they go to their two tight end package they got two guys in Vernon Davis and Jordan Reed they're like like receivers and Vernon Davis can flatout Ron that was an excellent pickup by GM Scott McLuhan someone he was familiar with from his days in San Francisco and he's helped when Reed's been down second in a cousin's pulls it down and gets rid of it so now big third down and eight Redskins are inside field goal range for Hopkins this Giants defense even as I said without snores Jenkins they just do an excellent job in coverage and you look at their past defense ranking in the NFL they're ranked 22nd in yards allowed but they are fifth in passing yards per play so it's not indicative of how good they are they are hard before all the football gives and quarterbacks simply do not come into games against them and have very good afternoon Olivier Vernon is back along the defensive front for the Giants just got it away on third name cousins drops it underneath top singer nowhere to go it's fourth down the field goal unit will come on in this Giants defense stay strong we sure do they give up a big play to Vernon Davis and then they tighten up and now it's going to be left for a field goal attempt to cut this to a one possession game and you can see Kirk Cousins he's trying to signal out to the outside with Jameson Crowder he had Jameson Crowder who had been short for the from sort of the first down but the key stopped there by the Giants hold for one as Hopkins 32yard try skins are on the board sevenpoint game and Landover Maryland under a half minute to go in quarter number three well the Redskins will kick it away and Dwayne Harris is back waiting for it for the Giants injured earlier able to come back the Pro Bowler 25 seconds left in quarter number three and Hopkins number two in the league in touch backs and another to the pile Wednesday night huge college hoops showdown on fs1 to the best of the biggies battle chart leads top ranked Villanova against number 13 Butler tips off wednesday at 6:30 Eastern on FS 1 look at the numbers for ball control dominated by the Giants have had a tough time with that specific category statistically all year it's why the defense has been even that more impressive because they've been out on the field a lot they've dominated by only seven toss to shepherd at times almost lost his footing and the Mason foster almost took his helmet off with the tackle a gain of seven if you look at the second half and how its unfolded I don't know that you can get a lot more out of this Redskins defense they've done an excellent job when the Giants have had good field position and they've made some key stops that's it for quarter number three in a sevenpoint game back up to this from your local Fox station third carry of the year for sterling Shepherd a moment ago on first down and you see the tackle he gets twisted looked like they were looking at his back when he came to the sideline it appears to be okay and as we start the fourth quarter it will be second down for the Giants who lead by seven seasonhigh in rushing yards for the Giants today actually more yards on the ground and through in 44 to 125 they haven't turned it over and is to Perkins he get stood up at the line of scrimmage it's third down Perkins has had a nice afternoon he's knocking on the door for a hundred yards rushing some success with the Redskins they tighten things up so they get a chance to try to make a stop once again I said they've done a nice job here in this second half of getting off the field and at least given their offense an opportunity who were able to cut it to a one possession game there's Perkins with day but he stopped short here that extra effort made it close he is a yard maybe less than a yard short of the first down and the punt team comes on for the Giants they put Brett Jones in there at fullback and they don't have a fullback on their roster they use the tight ends in that role but they put Jones in at fullback trying to get him in behind that to pick up the short yardage situation and the Redskins make a stop third straight three and out for the Giants Redskins down by seven figure to get it back unless the Giants do some trickery here on fourth and one just got it away clean fair catch by Crowder Lynden trail big six seven almost get to that fun Redskins habit down seven this way for the Washington Redskins they had some Heartbreakers week two against Dallas the cousins interception in the end zone they lose the game then the last second comeback by the Lions in week seven week eight in London against the Bengals Hopkins misses a late 34 yard field goal in overtime that would have been a winner so Washington comes into this game eight six and one they need a win to get into the playoffs and toss to Thompson running left Robinson able to jigglers wade through to make the stop a gain of four and again keep waiting for it to happen Jenkins has been out in the second half Odell Beckham has been out for the second half for the Giants and other than that Ben McAdoo is throwing it all at Washington and we've seen Dwight Harris leave the game we saw them watching and looking it's sterling Shepherd I think you start to hold your breath a little bit if you're a Giants fan boy the Redskins have overcome a lot this year we showed what some of those opportunities were that were missed start the year out of two and here they are I got it all perform right here just got it away on second and six in the pass is incomplete for Garcon third and six coming up here's charissa with the game break thanks Joe Kansas City was up 2017 when Alex Smith connects with shark and requested his to yard score now if Kansas City wins and Raiders lose Kansas City the to sea to open would be the fifth open down big right now to the Broncos Joe Joyner Kansas City they are not just hot but they are good they are a team that could very easily show up in Houston they're really good Andy Reed and that staff has done an excellent job and they have been for a number of years third down and six cousins hangs in the pocket throws and a grab by Crowder he's been begging for the ball all game and that was a nice catch on third down it really was I mean he had one catch prior to this for just five yards and this is a big one to keep this drive alive and he's able to get turned around and go up and make a play and that's an excellent job of securing the catch hanging on to the ball and keeping this drive going it's only the seventh first down of the entire game for Washington first down Kelly the seus gets taken for a ride and in Sheriff the probowl guard was there to push the pile as well watch every live 2017 NFL playoff game in HD all day too free on NFL mobile second and five just take the sean jackson out of the game they bring in the rookie Maurice Harris Kelly running rights he's gonna close down the Redskins wanted a flag at the end of that play and it looked like one could have been thrown with maybe a late hit on Rob Kelly in Robinson I think that's a good non call contact was made about the time he was at the boundary right there boy is right on that Redskins sidelines everything first certainly screaming for a call ball at midfield with the first down a for Kirk Cousins in Robinson another one of those key guys for the Giants defense this year Washington 2012 2:15 nice catch and that's the aforementioned rookie Maurice Harris he had to reach behind him to grab it a gain of 15 not an easy catch for Harris trying to make amends for when he slipped in DRC had the interception but a ball that's behind him and yet he's able to get turned around and make a play 15yard completion and that's the seventh different receiver Cousins has found for a completion in this game you can see watching this Redskins offense they they want to stretch it vertically and get big chunks in that passing game make it to Kelly cause any spines Davis perfect bro and a first down and out of bounds inside that's warning Vernon Davis last few weeks spent a little bit quiet but he went through a stretch there this year where he was making a lot of big plays bad coverage there by Eli Apple with the contact but Vernon Davis is a big physical guy and then he's able to come back out and get open and Kirk Cousins delivers him a nice ball 18 yard completion to Vernon Davis and his 11th year in a Super Bowl champion and a limited role a year ago to Denver good job on the offensive line given Cousins in time allowing Davis to work that secondary tight formation Kelly gets it on takes it inside the 15 Oh war upon the stock this is the first drive we're really seeing this this game where they seem to be putting some plays together and developing a little bit of offensive rhythm and they've got the Giants on their heels Sojin Juarez Jenkins Olivier Vernon is out there for the Giants they musta starting defense the first down his flag is down they make it Morgan Moses the right tackle he was pulling from the right tackle position he might have gotten his arm holding offense number 76 10yard penalty replay second down see him there 76 who exactly was Keenan Keenan Robinson the linebacker was trying to hit it and then Moses got his right arm around his neck when Morgan Moses made the mistake of coming up to jeans territory mid announcement to plead his case jean said back off I'm a sheriff around here there's two sheriff's out there one close right guard for the Redskins the others wearing stripes second and 17 Thompson was the target no flag as Damon Harrison that big body was out there on 25 that's an excellent job by Damon Harrison he's trying to rush the quarterback and then he recognizes what the Redskins are trying to do with the screen then to Chris Thompson he is able to get on he see that left hand he gets West Bend a little bit of a veteran move there grabbing the back of the Jersey and a nice mouthpiece to boot third down in 17 got a cell looking for blocks and a flag at the end of it a lot of Pierre Garcon right here initially when they threw it and like he had any kind of chance to pick up the yards necessary for the first he just went and got it it looked like they're going to get Landon Collins with the late hit and it's a good call attack a few more yards onto the end of that play but what a job by Pierre Garcon just knowing what he had to do and going after the play personal foul laid it out of bounds defense in the quarter one half the distance to the goal automatic first I'll see what's out in front of Garcon once he gets the ball Keane Robinson is there and Andrew Adams and he's able to break that tackle and just went after it Landon Collins is at an all prototype year quarterback back there in the secondary for this good defense to see what's happened on this Drive compared to the first nine five first downs first and goal rats on this one over one blitz three Washington not amazing x4 Jordan read on the slant route he's got to go up for it and for a guy who's playing with a shoulder injury knowing you're going to get popped after you make that play by Kenan Robinson that's a that's a heck of a job securing the ball and giving this Redskins a team a chance to tie this game up this Washington team gets a lot of production out of their tight ends Pro Bowler this year Jordan Reed has his sixth touchdown of the season his most important and that extra point was nearly blocked don't forget been 21 yarder on third and 17 to set it up read with a touchdown and we're tied in Landover Jordan Reed did the hard part he hung on on that oneyard touchdown throw from Kirk Cousins after the hit from Keenan Robinson then the extra point was almost blocked you think these Giants aren't playing hard Meilin anything in in a game that doesn't mean anything for their playoff position I'll show it to you after this and impressive showing by the Giants here in week 17 and here is the near block by who else guy who's had a huge impact in the game Dominique Rodgers Cromartie just a matter of interest he misses this ball is you're going to see laid out gave it everything that he where he is playing like a nineyear veteran that really cares about the effort here we know the Giants are the number 5 see where are they headed next week we don't know that until tonight out to his right with Victor Cruz the target it's incomplete the Giants where will they has well if you go to Green Bay that's some postseason success there but nobody wants any part of Aaron Rodgers right now it could go to Atlanta that looks unlikely they could go to Detroit certainly are all the way out to Seattle depending on if Seattle beats the 49ers or not they lose the answer will be Seattle if they win the answer will be the winner of the NFC North and that will be decided tonight in Detroit brother Giants on the road and playoff game since oh seven and that's taken Super Bowls out of the mix which are played away from they're down in five vanning down he goes Cullen Jenkins a former giant is there to tap him down it's fourth down that's the first sack of the afternoon for the Redskins Colin Jenkins is able to get past just in few here's Colin Jenkins number 73 he puts a spin move on on Pugh and Eli Manning with just a fourman rush unable to do anything with it and again the Redskins defense a group that has struggled all year has played really excellent football in this second half to give their offense which should struggle a chance to get back in it and on the last possession tied up this punt by wing heads out about before Crowder can get to it market at the 31 we're cousins will have it tagging well the offensive leaders Kirk Cousins getting hot 250 yards one touchdown one pick Pierre Garcon big yards to set up that last touchdown by the guy at the far end of that graphic Jordan Reed missed the home of Super Bowl 51 America's game of the week is tied Redskins win and they are in barring a tie in Detroit tonight she's in the air it's off the hands of Vernon Davis here's that big play by Pierre Garcon on third down and 17 he had blocking in front he got the late hit at the end of it set up first and goal and in their way he's a terrific player he has been for a long time I own Kirk Cousins has always said that he owes Peyton Manning to thank you for the job that he did and in bringing garçon along when he was playing for him with Indianapolis Colts he's a real technician in terms of running routes one of the really great competitors in our game and that was early to play the game for the Redskins picking up that first down with a total turnaround for the Redskins you look at that yardage figure had too much heat on it Crowder was alone but couldn't make the catch Washington score on their first eight possession since then they've gone field goal and touched down to tie it and this would have made max scherzer proud the Washington Nationals that thing was smoking over there definitely got some arm strength and you just kind of wonder what's going through his head right now knowing what's at stake and only for the team but also for him third down and ten blitz Redskins pick it up down the field for Jackson incomplete and after getting the ball right back it's bring it out and a 22 second drive put together by Washington yeah three consecutive pass plays there and the Giants brought pressure on that third and long and we've seen spagnolo do that certainly a few other times in this game but they got bottled up and it afforded cousins some extra time and you do that with DeSean Jackson running down the field he's a hard TRC was there Jackson red hot coming in just 23 yards in this game Dwayne Harris back to the 20 and that's where the market Eli Manning's still in the ballgame tied attack hello friends this is michael grandage from the NFL on fox way up here at the top of the stadium with my good friend Binnie Scaffidi and the Skycam crew and we just want to send a special message out to everybody watching at home so Vinnie take it away you got it Mike that's great happy new year from all of us to all of you Padrino Steele and Jim Nantz is line hello friends 10/10 game Giants have it at their own 20 which is science our producer rich Rousseau our director Aaron Andrews down on the field joining the booth there's Perkins and he gets brought down by Mason Foster who has been busy last four times Giants have had it it's been Brad wing the punter on the field to end the possession yeah it's been tough sledding since Ben McAdoo elected to go for it on fourth down and they didn't convert and since then they just have not been able to do anything four consecutive three and out so we thought they made some progress in that first half offensively with a lot of good things but boy this second half has been challenging for the Giants here's Tom foster 17 tackles in this game from Mason Foster who is the top tackler for this Washington defense coming in he also had a big tipped pass earlier in the game he's played great he really has he's been all over the field they got a lot of plays he's been in the backfield see if they're able to force another three now third down and five Victor Cruz and you can see defensive coordinator Jill berry hot along the sidelines that his defense just gave up that five plus yards it's one of those plays and we've seen the Packers run so often they actually put in some rules emphasis in terms of not allowing receivers to block downfield before the ball is caught it's a bangbang deal he was the only guy who was going to get the ball and you leave the other receivers out in front to block those wouldbe tacklers and the Giants pick up a muchneeded first down only the fourth first out of the half for the Giants this is for King down girl hit in stride and the first year player out of Georgia is good for 44 yards it's just a simple growth go round by the bar is king against Greg taller he gets him beat and Eli Manning is able to beat Blackman with the ball up the sidelines was a perfectly thrown pass and now whistles stop play before they can snap it from the 25 there inside field goal range 350 one left with the Gamecock operator please reset the game clock to three minutes 58 seconds so the clock issue let's just see it again that's the guy who Eli has to hold and he's got to beat with the football at that sideline no one the King had a step on Toler in a big play for this Giants team that they've had a hard time coming up with here in the second half the young man had one catch for 6 yards that one for 44 and the Giants have longest play the game from the 25 and Paul Perkins is good for three it's the first time this seeds in the Giants have had a 100 yard rusher his name is Paul Perkins coming off the careerhigh 68 at Philly in five first downs he's got a new careerhigh at 102 Jennings back in there on second and seven James Chris Peters and now John Jerry of the got into it no flag that I see one of the Redskins went tumbling at the end of that play it will be third and seven we've got the Giants now to go down once again and see if they can't come up with a stop to force a field goal attempt and get the ball back into the hands of their offense just got it away they're gonna say incomplete now which is important because it stops the flock the two minutes 17 seconds left initially they said the pass was complete it's sterling shepherd and that ball bounced in there and a good reversal of what was initially going to be called a completed pass albeit short of the first down Eli Eli frustrated with that throw disappointed he has a chance in the Redskins they bring pressure and Giants are able to pick it up and just really one of the few throws that Eli has had today that this has been off the mark 40yard try now by Robbie Gould Giants back on top now 10 for 10 on the season in his 10th game with the Giants Robbie Gould and this was drilled through hold by wing after the from deeossie and it was true off the right foot of Robbie gold for a threepoint giant lead well now it all comes down to this drive for the Washington Redskins like we said to have the year that they've had and even Jay Gruden has talked about it this week and said it's been a rollercoaster year but they've they've weathered the storm in a lot of ways and put themselves in a position in week 17 to win and with all likelihood then make it into the postseason and it all comes down to the next two minutes of 12 seconds trying to get to the postseason backtoback years for the first time since the end of Joe Gibbs first tour of duty in Washington in 91 they went and they won Super Bowl 26 in 92 a good defensive team Marc Griffin was the quarterback they didn't go all the way but that's the last time they went in backtoback seasons last year to won the division at nine and seven they had the threeyear stretch in the early 90s but they need a win to get in I'll have two minutes 12 seconds to get down the field and at least come up to three here's Curt Menefee with a game break and there's that man again Ricky Tyreke L of the Kansas City chief take this punt 95 yards for the touchdown right now Kansas City's on top of San Diego 34:20 late the fourth quarter opens being blown out in Denver late in the fourth quarter so it looks like the Chiefs will win the AFC West and clench a first round by going into the playoffs Joe Troy yeah and downside of that as you said is Oakland without their starting quarterback Derek Carr with McGloin at the controls will not get a bye from the 25 on first down Redskins Jackson out of bounds at the 35 or the first down I guess this is kind of what you dream about right Troy Aikman as a quarterback he got a field in front of you you get down the field get into the end zone and all likelihood you end up in the play it's a good feeling and yeah like you said I mean to have it riding all right here with a threepoint deficit and a chance to go out with down the field and potentially win the ballgame and enter the postseason for the second time in a row that's it's big stuff pass is caught Davis gets flipped by Trevin Wade and we're at the twominute warning it'll be second down for Kirk Cousins and the Redskins we come back season on the line two minutes left second and seven ball at the 39 of the Redskins down by three and all likelihood a win and into the playoffs nathan's Thompson has to spin to catch it and then is going to fight for first down yardage they'll give him the full seven Leon Hall on the tackle first down Washington tonight's go home with a fourman rush they played coverage and you know as the Redskins start to move and they cross the 50yard line here you start to believe Spagnola bring more pressure Thompson's been busy a little back Chris Thompson who is listed in 58 195 good 411 another first down and in case you're wondering is the Redskins take their first timeout Dustin Hopkins has missed from 57 his career long as 54 yards last year that means getting it to the 36 yard line they're not that far away from that spot that purple line it's laid in there at the 36 this may very well rest on the right leg of Hopkins to tie it or number eight can try and win it well by the Redskins called timeout they've given they've given the Giants an opportunity to create some fresh pass rushers technologists foul something up if actually choosing to do surveys intercepted by Dominique Rogers Cromartie and that could very well the year for Washington second interception second turnover of the game as well and it's a backbreaker for the Redskins Evan Cunard he's going to be the one who puts the pressure he doesn't get a sack but it's the pressure by him that forces cousins the slide to his left and try to make a throw to Garcon without being able to plant his feet and then lead him across the middle he's open but Dominique Rogers Rogers Cromartie in a trail technique and a ball been thrown behind him he's able to make a play once again in 14 a Redskins Drive Washington has two timeouts left but here's Eli Manning who's played through it it appears the Giants have gotten through this game without any significant injuries as a ball carrier rush all year Josh Norman on the stop timeout taken by Washington they have only one left so if that was a careerdefining drive not a good ending cousins had been four for four prior to that throw as they're going down right on the edge of field goal range as it was cousins throws the interception you know what's crazy about this particular game Joe is just how good that the Redskins have played defensively here in the second half and for a team that has really written the offense throughout the year and with the game on the line just unable to deliver Joe Barry defense in the second half has been awfully good only one time out timeout Washington with a minute two remaining so let's talk about the Giants as you look at the Sean Jackson on one hand the Giants in this game gotten through it without turning the ball over that's been a problem for the Giants this season and of late over the last four games Eli Manning had thrown six touchdowns against six interceptions that's the side that's good the bad side for the Giants is they will have average scoring under 15 points over their last five games and the points just haven't been there but man their defense has been awesome and we talked about it during the game as good as that defense has been this year if they just protect the football they're going to be hard to beat but they showed a lot of good stuff in that first half when a struggle here in the second half but winning builds confidence it's third down and seven bring up 4th down but the clock will continue to run and you see the difference between the play clock and the game clock the Giants I'm sure can run it down as much as they want either take the penalty or take the timeout and Jay Gruden his team is seconds away from going to eight seven and one and then giving us a really clear picture of the NFC playoff picture which means even the loser in tonight's game in that battle for the NFC North title is in the playoffs as the number 16 well this has been a stunning game I mean hey we all knew what was at stake for the Redskins and we knew there was nothing to be gained by the the Giants by winning and yet McAdoo did what he said he was going to do and play his guys and Damon Harrison he played the entire game and you know so many of them did and the Giants seemed like they were the team that had something to play for and the Redskins looked like they were the team that had already walked something up and just did not give a very good effort and what a time not to be at your best in week 17 with so much at stake both McAdoo's there's no relation between those two but it could be it's on TV again that kid and been back at you on should be awfully proud and his first year as a head coach taking over after the 12year run by Tom Coughlin that netted two Super Bowl championships I was going to go in as a number five seed in his first year as the head man after two years as the offensive coordinator under Coughlin wing will Punnett this needs to get rid of it which he does and prouder he's got ten six seconds left and Zach deeossie the long snapper downfield will get credit for the tackle and by Jamison Crowder trying to make something out enough and ran off some valuable seconds so again cousins back to the field likely the last snap bonus coverage of this game which was crazy and again if Seattle loses it would be the Giants at Seattle next week I don't think anybody saw that coming with all the upheaval with the San Francisco 49ers the credit to those players in a battle with the Seahawks they've got the Giants do four players five players deep this is it flag is dead and on the lateral on a bounce it's Trevin way to will take it in for the touchdown and the call is an ineligible man downfield this touchdown will stand how about that for an end of the ballgame Trent Williams the left tackle just through his helmet ten yards there's a flag down but it's for ineligible downfield on the play as the knowledgeable man downfield offense number 61 that penalty is declined in the result of the play as a touchdown for the New York Giants by rule we must also kick the point after try so they have to kick the extra point here's the play because this was a lateral who plays alive as Jordan Rainey included backward and Trevon Wade was there for the short hop right into his gut for the touchdown they're trying to get everybody off the field and by a rule they have to kick the extra point just not sure exactly why the other thing you want to say to the nation right now is this games over I mean ye by role do we have to kick the extra point but I'm sure there's a reason and Mike Ferrer is like bouncing in his chair in Los Angeles waiting to get on and tell you what that reason would be well by the time they clear this field there won't be anybody left in the stands to see it wonder what Al Michaels would say in a spot like this but on a serious matter Jay Gruden his offense that's been recordsetting the history of this great franchise with Washington has to be shocked that his offense was shut down the way it was here today by the Giants and the well the Giants have their offense out there and I would expect they'll has taken me that's it nineteen to ten that's the final been McAdoo for the most part played them all Odell Beckham jr. is Jenkins out in the second half but his team came in here on the road against a divisional rival they win it and knock out the Washington Redskins will come back and then send it to bonus coverage after this
