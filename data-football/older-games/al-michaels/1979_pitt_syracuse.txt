sun shining brightly on the sky good matchup the Pittsburgh Panthers at home it's their final home game of the season by the way against the Syracuse Orangemen who play all of their games on the road because their new stadium is under construction hello again everybody Al Michaels joined today by Frank Broyles and frankly we talked about the offensive Syracuse the defense of Fitchburg superior to his win today would it be 50 points on the board or better defense well I think course they'd like to have a much better defense but since their defense had been ineffective this in itself dictates a certain strategy took call the Syracuse team they've got to keep the ball ball possession if they can accomplish this their defense is on the sideline and obviously they won't play as much and there's a technique that you use in this how do you run high possession plays you run plays and aren't wrists at high percentage I should say and short passes and keep the ball at least make one or two first downs every possession kick it if you can't score and start Pittsburgh deep on their end of the field mr. aky√ºz offense potent as it is we serve major test today against the pit defenses the Syracuse Orangemen so turf at MIT Stadium with a record of five and three under head coach Frank Maloney Maloney in his sixth year at the helm but the Pittsburgh defense is anchored by 99 see the Panthers winner in their opener over Kansas than a loser against North Carolina and five consecutive victories including one over unbeaten Navy last week right here 24/7 a victory led by the own freshman quarterback Danny Marino but let's talk about you Green because you're not gonna find very many offensive in the country he's only a junior and he's made allamericans YC sixfoottwo weighs 220 pounds and believe this he's the fastest player on the defensive team and he's used as kind of a big playmaker on the defense the fans will see him today and defense it right in at defenses left in at linebacker they have won a place in where they think Syracuse is going to run the football or pass so that he can be the stop calls the bad play and force a kid he is an exciting football for tobacconist what about sir accuses defensive strategy will that change anything yes there's a coach's strategy to use against the experienced quarterback give him a surprise deep as do things differently upset evil ohrid calls him to think and lose his confidence anything like this is good strategy against the price per quarterback a lot of blitzing you think a lot of blitzing a lot of changes anything to make you miss read the coverages all right so it's the Panthers of Pittsburgh the orange man of Syracuse ready for action at Pitt Stadium we'll be back with a kickoff right after this you know this how does the sign of one of America's largest most important insurance companies fireman's fine but right now we're gonna be here Pittsburgh quarterback there is Rick for Conor they are hopeful that he can play again this season he'll miss today's game obviously and probably next week's encounter and then they are hopeful that thing will be back in time for the great rivalry against Penn State December 1st the referee today is bill Parkinson work music midfield and let's listen in for the coin toss wait wait the clock is official on the field I've got a coin here a head and a tail who's gonna call this you're caught if I dropped the coin re toss call he calls tails it's a tail it's a kale and what is one the cost we receive what's Bowie the phone anyway white wins the toss it will receive take in the Syracuse Orangemen winning the toss and so we will take a look at they're very very potent offense immediately as the Panthers get set to kick off the breeze is not much of a factor a slight breeze blowing as you look at the field from right to left right now at about five miles per hour and the Pittsburgh Panthers ready to kick off they were so hopeful of a major bowl bid as far as going to a bowl such as the Fiesta and Gator and those are major bowls they would seem to be in pretty good shape right now with a record of six and one Frank I think so al if they can win these next four ballgames they will be a strong contender for any of those bowl with a quarterback like the true Cano and also Marino good running excellent defense they have a chance dropping back deep for the orange number 45 is art book they're great wide receiver and then Joe Morris the other name man as you look at fun averaging almost 25 yards per return on kickoffs and better than 13 yards on punt returns and he's flanked by Joe Morris they've traveled to kickoff for the Panthers and so here we go from Pitt Stadium with the kick angling toward the far side staying in bounds and picked up by Morris at the five and he gets out to the 13 a break for the Panthers in that the kickoff stayed in bounds it looked like it was going out offensively Bill Hurley the great option quarterback when they've got Ken Mandeville the short yardage man he scored five TVs this season we've already highlighted Joe Morris they're great back Brian ish man one wide receiver number 29 and the other Art Monk who might make some allamerica teams number 45 he also lines up from time to time as a running back right now they have him in the slot on first down from the 13 yard line and they shift into the eye with a tailback Joe Morris early after a long count spinning see that play a lot today he picks up the yard it'll be second down and I'm the men up front from right to left on the right side John McCallum there's their best lineman Frank wolf Lee the right guard in the middle a of Joe Hodges number 50 for the center Tony has an is the left guard Eastern Buffalo through Kissinger the left tackle from Parma Ohio and Tony Snyder is the tight end number 81 out of East Rochester New York we have an injured Panther Greg Meisner al they bear fine defensive left tackle seemed like he's maybe hurt his leg just a little bit so Meisner part of a great defensive line which is anchored by Hugh green as we see if their dream normally lines up as the left hand from time to time he's a linebacker or might line up over the offensive tackle Meisner is a man who just in the middle and kneeling Ricky Jackson is a good run number 87 the two linebackers pallucci and right good and then they've got Carlton Williamson at strong safety white as a firstyear star this veronik at the right corner their best defensive back is probably Joe Joe Heath number 36 so here comes my Zener as the Panthers lose a key defensive performer at least temporarily on the first scrimmage play of the game now it's very important that Syracuse make a first down because if they don't they have to punt and Pittsburgh would have excellent field position it is second down and nine the ball at the 14 yard line Syracuse lining up in the I about 50% of the time and here's Mars his first carry you can see how explosive he is out to the 22 yard line it takes no time for Joe to pick up full speed he has explosive speed now the things that Pittsburgh coaches a word about is that he runs through tackles he does not go down easily bill Hurley can put his name into the record along with only two other quarterbacks by picking up 21 yards through the air his third down and one and they give a command to go and he is punched up as he tries to get the first down at the 23yard line it looks like he's shy as bill Neal 76 was right there so they spot the ball just outside at the 23 yard line bill Parkinson says bring in the change it's going to be very close bill Neal is a outstanding football player al but he's also an electrical engineer major and a three plus student and it's a first down so the orange picking up the first and just barely with Mandeville caring for the necessary yard and just outside the 23 first and 10 sprained ankle is the official record through the bench Meisner so first I'm just outside the 23 they send monk in motion Curley on a roll as a man wide open at the 33 yard line and it's complete number 45 close to the first let's let's watch it from the endzone but as we do it's a ruleout pass and Pittsburgh had jumped into an eightman line a perfect player Bob Hurley excellent crow good concentration by muck their leading receiver receiver close to another first down and I'll bring in the change again good call al throwing old first down Pittsburgh anticipated one jumped on an 8man get deep it's the best thing against a man in motion and a flat pass good game for Syracuse early a fifth year senior herd in the opener last year as they measure and it's another first out for Syracuse Hurley heard on the seventh play of the night and then he came back and played in one more game but he came out of that one in terrible shape physically so they applied for the hardship ruling got it and they Epperly back in 1979 doing a great job the hardship rule is you can play in only two games in any of the first five football games if you do that to qualify as automatic and that was the case for hurley the rh with two straight first downs at the 34 yard line monk in motion and they give it to morris who gets it after the 39 yard line early just didn't get that play off because blanc was in motion and ran out of room he almost ran out about they used an unbalanced line for the first time and then put muck back in motion and pittsburgh adjusted their defense left a little bit Running Room over the left bar a gain of five at his second down in five Syracuse starting this drive from the 13 yard line at the 39 second down and five Lunken motion again early on a roll looking the way Ricky Jackson Brady he plays one in and then you see no green ninetynine he plays the other end the green is involved in seemingly every play and I guess of course if the coaches willing to try to run away from green they have to pick on Jackson and he was you mentioned earlier would be a star for any other football team he has great ability from Florida by the way and Green is from Mississippi they plucked you out of Natchez third down five the sole running back is Morris in this alignment with bunk split wide to the right Curley under some pressure throwing incomplete was the intended receiver beverage bottle in Thomas and so the orange will have to punt very critical play by Thomas okay a good break on the ball the receiver was open momentarily but he outran the football to deflect it and completely John White to do the punting for Syracuse Joe heat standing in his own twenty flag is down white taking in to a slight win the low kick with good distance and he fumbles the ball bouncing loose and he has to come out with it and does he is the question but remember a flag down at the line of scrimmage he did come out with it as they spot the ball inside the one but a marker down at the line of scrimmage that was a close to being a safety good graces what a tough break for Syracuse yelling go proceed for all against the RNA so it doesn't mean a thing in the life to kick again but this watch exactly what happened on this play at the kick funk was fumbled momentarily but watch him pick it up right on the goal line Jojo he's number 36 he gets he tries to get back to the 1 and I guess officials ruled that he did but the play all of them over it's all academic anyway what happened here because this burg was fair lucky oh that play they would be starting from the one foot block white is averaging 37 yards of kick and this time instead of he it's carrying white who drops back for the Panthers another low kick but again good distance white massive back up drops it picks it up at the 15 for the 20 and wait in a footrace inside the 10 touchdown Pittsburgh this looking like an absolute genius he had Heath back there and then after the penalty he puts right back there and Terry goes all the way for the touchdown and the Panthers break out on top black Schubert to attempt the extra point that is good so 2 minutes and 56 seconds into the game at 7 nothing Panthers as we see it again watch quite fumble the ball momentarily it was a low kick bear little hang time Pittsburgh has a good wall setup you could see from the theater press box is on one man the king of white had a chance to tackling he couldn't make the play Terry wife goes in for the touchdown buck to that point white had returned only two kicks all season for 14 yards 7 nothing pen few survey where the land is wild in his third years the head coach at Pittsburgh one time assistant at Arkansas under Frank Broyles and played at Alabama and coach the bear Brian we were very happy to have him on our state David trout kicking off and Syracuse will start from the 20 so a most distressing beginning for the orange it looked like they had picked pinned inside the 1 and instead it's 7 huffing Panthers coaches work all the time don't make mistakes on the kicking game now for Syracuse 8 to 1 being all side had to punt it again then they kick the ball and had their pool coverage so the orange they picked up two first downs on their first series start from the 20 early the quarterback with Mandeville and Mars the running backs on the short paddocks Joe Morris to the 24 made to stop and let's take a look at Chanukah part returned 85 yards by white sometimes when you put the defense recovers relax just a minute but he has a beautiful wall and then he used his good judgment it protected himself from the sidelines where he could cut either way Terry White number 23 an excellent return touchdown from the 24 second down and six for Syracuse hitching and fumbled and fell upon by number 47 Juarez Ricky Jackson was right there as you look Moroni in his sixth year at Syracuse under some fire because Melones had a losing record of course he took over for a legend Ben schwartzwalder was there for a quarter of a century it was one of the great coaches of all time good friend the loaning and native of Chicago went to school at Michigan and coach there under Bo Schembechler third down seven from the 23 monk goes in motion they take care of green so Hurley has some time in a little bit but only gets back to just about the line of scrimmage the 23 Jeffco Lucy made the tackle so the Pitt defense giving up just seven points seven points per game third best in the country holding Syracuse here and again it's John white back to punt interestingly we will not see white who scored the touchdown back as the deep safety again it's Jojo he threw he's tired the kick is a good one far side he lets it bounce and it goes at the 28 all right Pittsburgh with a freshman sixfoot for danny moreno the fullback Randy McMillan a JC transfer from air on rain rooster Jones he alternates with Freddy Jacobs Kenny bulls is the flanker number four and the leading receiver on the team of twenty seven catches is Ralph still 88 the split in our first look now at Dan Marino from Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh in the shadow of the Pitt campus highly recruited decided to stay at home Marino with a long count we've got a flag but a marker thrown at the snack now I think this interesting to our fans to point out their colleges all over the nation are using motion all the Dallas Cowboys shifted their people began some confusion and unsettling situations on the defense to help the offense that time a had been T prior as you see the illiberal this is your call report by the defensive tapped in the linebacker College ran up front for the Panthers you've got Bob Gruber anchoring the left side a team member is a good one the left guard number 62 in the middle is Russ Grimm Boris is the right guard numbers seventy it is second down and 11 Moreno still getting it away Joe Oshin made the stop and I'll see the rest of the line mark made on the right side a man Benji Pryor most improved football player and the second leading receiver on the team and a man who you will see line under the 10 inch spot in slot himself and go emotion from time to time today loss of two third down 13 hit from the 25yard line 919 to go first period 7 nothing Panthers Moreno getting it away but incomplete they try to set up the screen for Jones and the pressure was applied on Moreno that time by John Kinley who came boring in number 43 that's one thing to stop an inexperienced quarterback has put a good rush Kinley was a linebacker has good speed for seven speed horse Moreno control before he was broke David trout to do the putty he's averaging 35 yards a kick slight pointed his back as long as techni season 56 yards martin monk is back to receive for syracuse calls to the fair catch and mason at the 40 yard line for syracuse its best field position of the day as they'll start this drive after a 35yard kick so the difference right now the 85 yard run back by Terry white first quarter 903 to go 7 nothing Panthers good year tiempo official Arizona State in a mustwin Acton battle with Stanford or simple Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC you're looking at Terry white who ran back to kick 84 yards for the touchdown they get 7 uh pink Panther's he plays the left corner defensively from pet as syracuse takes over at the 40 first and 10 market motion and Mandeville picks up two yards out to the 42 where Jeff Valusia number 51 is there to meet him Pelosi the senior from Youngstown Ohio and has had two brothers one just finished it a young brother on the Freshman team second down and let's call it seven Syracuse just inside its own 43 yard line their third offensive series Morris he's only 5 7 177 but he doesn't hesitate with that football he's been very impressive so far in his first one in fact out Pittsburgh busted their defense they moved over to the wide side of the deal and they were called very shorthanded on the weak side first down at the pit 47 yard line that's more emotion this time early looking complete down to the 33 yard line Brian ich Minh number 29 making the catch at that I was right here with him they spend his second leading receiver on the team coming NE faut 12 in the first eight games for the orange but give Hurley credit for that completion he is running to the left now tough to turn back throw sidearm it's right on the nose he now has 25 yards passing so he becomes the third man in NCAA history to rush for more than 2,000 yards and passed for more than 3000 in his career as they send Moncton motion on first down give it to Morris and he's chopped down at the 30 yard line the other quarterbacks who rushed for better than 2000 passed or more than 3000 time part in a debate between 1971 and 1973 and rick Leach at Michigan between 1975 and 1978 so early it's a elite company he certainly is good run a good passer good option quarterback second down six Syracuse at the pit 29 Morris Steve football number 58 the junior from Pittsburgh 63 249 pounder forcing him out so the boss body inside the 29 yard line third down and six Panthers leading seven nothing was 653 to go in the first quarter early his receiver phone it's intercepted by Dean yardline so another big play by white as the intended receiver bailed out but a marker is down a marker is now back at the 33 yard line roughing the passer looks like Al personal foul and that is the call and so that negates the interception Gary white had run back a kick for a touchdown then the intercepted pass but it's all nullifying here as we see it again that's watching he rolls out to the ride he had an unbalanced line protection so that he couldn't put the force on him turns back throws inside he was Ricky Jackson 87 yes let's see if we detect it right here you cannot hit the passer in the face that's what he called Jackson came down across the face that's illegal so instead of the Panthers having at his first time Syracuse from the 14 its Moorish getting down to the six a few people but get Fred into the Syracuse line al they have opened up some good Holland's for is the defense's seventh in the nation and it doesn't take Mara's long to get through those old will short legs he running faster than we looks like Joe Morris just to sophomore from air Massachusetts back to back thousand yard seasons it is second down and two for a first down and six for a touchdown this is Mandeville fighting his money forward what looks to be a first down they jumped up Pittsburgh jumped into a gamete and Hurley she'll go out of doors and he just changed the play at the line split the two guards and made the first day he needed to got about two and a half and now its first and goal at the three as they line up in a straight team and it's mandated they stopped in this time after a gain of maybe at the yard yard it's ball carrier is averaging four yards a carry coming down scores five touchdowns which tells you that they like to give it the Mandeville when they down by the goal line well he had fought back you have the best shot straight ahead to the right of the left go the shortest distance to the goal line from where the ball of is placed second and goal early on the roll is time throwing it up we've got a marker down in the end zone and it's incomplete but a flag was thrown a lot of traffic near the back line that time he can see you Green was involved in the play luck was intended receiver and if it's pass interference on the offense it's a safety if it's past interference on the defense is the first battle the oneyard line it's on the defense let's watch 81 the side of Tidy in falls down gets up see if we can detect the interference number number 48 Williamson right there leave the interferences old muck up front right number 45 first down recovered in the end zone but I think they whistled again at the one they did can you believe that oh quick whistle Mandeville was the ball carrier lost it and then you heard the whistle as Maloney looks on from the syracuse bench how do you pick that up perfectly the whistle is stops the ball regardless of well the play has stopped enough that's it watch it real quick let's see if we detect Mandeville holding on right here the ball is knocked out the whistle had blown early picks it up scopes but they whistled it dead contending he was down so a second and goal in his/her wheel dives in for the touchdown so seconds they break on the quick whistle is able to exploit it the advantage of having a quarterback that can run with the football it puts a digital burden on the defense when you get close to the goal line to have to account for the quarterback situation they did the count for him and Hurley went in for the touchdown nice Hurley's 8 TD of the season trying to tie it up Anderson has and misses season he's 23 out of 23 the fake they'll go for two Ricky Jackson is back there to tackle Jeff Fischer number eight so the orange gamble have come up short but they're within a point we have 4:35 to go in the first quarter it's Pitt se7en Syracuse ex Bruce Jenner for the monotony school activities on the other half of education but are supported by less than 1% of the school budget in most communities that's the best bargain in education the National Federation of State High School Associations urges you to support high school activities which educate boys and girls with unmatched economic efficiency Sarah Kay trailing 76 Gary Andersen to kickoff Timothy Lewis and Jojo Heath back for the Panthers Louis the 20 and to the 31yard line Lauren Barbie made the stop let's take a look at the extra point again Fisher the holder here yeah he partly the ball he what what you coach this in practice now do you homophile the port of action the kicker sinhala power pick it up receivers release and he tries to make a twocomponent diversion out of a bad snap looked initially like they might be going for two on the fake but that wasn't the case fumbling the snap and so it's 7 to 6 with Pitt having it at the 31 yard line first down Jim Collins number 33 by far the best defensive player for Syracuse made the tackle coming up next the second half of our doubleheader today most of you will see the pac10 battle from Palo Alto Stanford against Arizona State those of you in Philadelphia via satellite you'll see temple against Hawaii for Hall over second and six 36 yard line again Collins is there number 33 College is 6 to 235 he's a junior out of Mendham New Jersey he was the team's MVP last year we have him isolated I call this is the belt linebacker and his role is just to key the football and try to get in on every play he was unknown 199 involvements last year by far the leader of the team the 41 yard line is complete on the far side still 88 the receiver and we have him isolated steal the receiver sort of the first step the official could have get in his fall at base below the bowl and it would have been a first step and on forth and less than a yard jackie sherrill is not going to gamble all right monk drops back for Syracuse to receive the kick from Dave trout low snap the trout is able to get it away angles it is inside the 25 makes a good pit bounce and rolls out at the 16 three mistakes by Syracuse and a kicking game we've already talked about that was a third without don't let the ball hit the ground it will roll and roll and roll so in in an artistic punt but nonetheless a 45yard kicked when you let the ball hit the ground Syracuse from the 16 yard line we have three minutes and two seconds remaining pit leaning seven to six ich bin split wide to the left they send one wide to the right and the animal is the sole running back is puck goes in motion from the 16 they give it to Mandeville who chugs his way to the 20 refuge action at the bottom of the file number 87 Ricky Jackson number 87 let's watch him make this plays defense it in 87 just goes right through the bunker and gets involved oh man the bill the fullback number 41 for a short game second down and six the orange from the 20yard line Mei this time far as the tailback man to build the fullback it's minute motion Mandeville whistle blew before he lost it at the 31 yard line first and Syracuse Annabelle make made a good run on that play there was a trap up the middle all for the fake option Pittsburgh defense was fooled completely Syracuse a potent offense but as Moloney explains he says if we don't have a good day running we're not going to win we can pass but not well enough to be picked they have a little mixture but it's not really the type team that would really hurt a team on passing down Morris we mentioned in the pregame show they likened Morris to Archie Griffin mm small very quick very wide and he has an uncanny ability there's his stats so far nine brushes 43 yards but he has the knack of finding the soft spot all these blocking zal are open blocking option blocking run wherever he sees daylight I love that shot from our director Jim Janette Mara's got lost a lot on second down five from the 37 well he's going to keep close to the blockade line and close to a first down Steve Fidel 58 there to make the tackle as the clock ticks down toward the 1minute mark left in the first quarter one piece of strategy for the fans Syracuse are using an unbalanced line about half the time doing this purposely kooky wide not think green away from the inside plays that puts him wata gives them an extra blocker on that side for pass protection you tries to cross them up though from time to time by playing in different positions flopping a lot this time they've got green line up on the left side defensively in its Moorish 45 yard line again it's Fidel Lynn Thomas number three in on the play and so it is second down and six Syracuse gained some confidence moving the ball they are blocking the the great Pittsburgh defense and they gained your confidence Pittsburgh better watch out don't encourage a team when you the favorite and don't give them occurred early pitching to Morris cuts back inside 48 yard line Carlton Williamson running it out and the clock still running as the tackle was made and bound so that'll do it for the 1st quarter when the second quarter begins Syracuse will be at the end of one its Pitt se7en Syracuse picked up nine first down nine in the first quarter none for Pitt it's third down from the 48 yard line third about for Morris drives to schedule a free loses the ball at Pitt has it on the bumble it's white number 23 who came up with it bumble for the tax down many intercepted a pass that was negated by the penalty and he picks up the fumble recovery here let's see being attacked exactly why Morris fumbles the ball number 47 the number 58 barosky's knocks the ball loose I'm sorry Fidel the linebacker white recovers so at midfield it's a first down for the Panthers and Moreno fumbles the snap and then falls up back into 46:39 so a stuttering start today for the freshman out of Central Catholic High School 64 200 pounder as we take a look at the numbers through period one in that amazing look at the time of possession that's what pops out at 2:00 12:15 two minutes and 45 seconds the young freshman quarterback has confidence he's got to come back and have something good happen right there look at that pitch side all single digits second down 14 from the 46 Marino some time has Jones open in orange territory and he's favored at the 44 will be third dad and for upcoming as James Collins made the tackle Marino showed a lot of course that's surprising they've been the surprise team so far lake bars seven and one going into that one with the Tigers third down for Pitt seeking its initial first down Moreno gets it away it's complete to fire my hair is tangled back shy of the first down Benji had the first then went back across the 40 yard line and we'll see where they spotted he may have crossed in the first he did out absolutely a good call let's watch Jim Collins a linebacker pass responsibility his role is to drop deep as soon as he sees the past duck too tight in in front of him he breaks up and gets involved and pushes prob back short of the first down so it's fourth and one and this time he'll go for it it's across the 40 and should have it white may was the man who led the charge there were 73 from the land side and they have the first so the Iroquois defense muchmaligned yields its first first down Cameron Connor Shafer and Kinley are up front the three linebackers Collins in the middle is the big man and there's the secondary Farkle Payne is their best defensive back the free safety number 20 inside the 40 burrito protected cutting in front of balls on a crossing pattern last time and incomplete was prior they had two receivers in the scene spot fake brow got pushed a little deeper by the quarterback than he wanted to to try to get in behind him let's watch it from the end zone you'll see that marina is a straight drop back past two men out to the right crowd number 84 couldn't control it let's see what if he takes his eyes off the ball right in his hands something burned his concentration incomplete second down and ten Moreno again he's four out of six and now he's five out of seven his player is tackled 33 yard line Mike suby 48 Tigers seven more on the board seven three nothing clemson in the second grade al bit Benjy bar is hurt on that particular play prior the tightend really coming into his own this season as a junior 65 230 pound out of New Kensington Pennsylvania he and round still have done a great job as the pit receivers they were wondering who in the world was going to replace Gordon too much Jones we have a timeout with 12 19 to go on the half hit in the head 7 to 6 America what's your favorite midsize sedan and what's the thing you like best about Malibu the 1980 Malibu American it takes a lot more than Talent the light up Broadway with a show like dancin it takes insurance without insurance protection for the theater actors of audience no theater owner could risk booking a show and there'd be a lot less litter on the Great White Way where Crum and Forster working with more than 9,000 independent agents and brokers helping ensure the American Way of life amazing Sugar Ray Leonard Olympic Jeff now undefeated throw this month it goes for the big one the WBC welterweight championship on ABC banjee Pryor went down after making the catch and assisted now from the field apparently the injury that's exactly what happens 84 prior the receiver he's coming across the middle course he's hit by Collins first and then the zoo Nick the linebacker and I guess it just wanted him a little bit looks like he'll be back we'll get a report it's third down and four from the 33 yard line Jones has the first make the tackle ray rooster Jones pabulum Mississippi now the big difference in this series is the coaches head very wisely let Marino drop the ball off give him some confidence and mainly the team confidence in him about throwing the short passes gain that confidence so paint without a first down in the first quarter they picked up successive first downs first and ten from the 28 Moreno under pressure able to get it over to Jones and rooster is out of bounds at about the 25 yard good judgment al they throw in the passes and he can build his confidence a screen delays something that will make some yardage and let the players say hey this freshman is good we want him in here Marino's a marvelous athlete he was so good at baseball in fact that the Kansas City Royals made in their fourth pick in the last round on second and 7 it's Joe through the 22 yard line before thirddown upcoming ohio state underway and rollin again taking over the Illini barrel briefs has just done a great job or just a fantastic job coming into a very difficult situation this is our trail hawkins carry for the first time when the game gets to the nineteen he is shy of the first down the injury to his right they did not believe it sir is though hopefully will she make you back in the game at the tight end spot in the meantime I am Mike Dombrowski number 80 to fill again for the second time on this drive base for the fourth down situation and able to take advantage and pick up the first and each time they ran over Park maze who just happens to stand six five and weighs 280 pounds I'll never forget meeting him at the Gator Bowl game three years ago when he had to start as a freshman May is from upstate New York so one of them we've got away from Syracuse whistle sound and the flag is dropped before the snap that time obviously an offensive lineman moved before the ball is snapped another new rules you can't snap the ball you can't even if you throw yard loss out you can take the plate if an offensive linemen lose after he takes his position then the play is dead right there if you block a kick and score with it you bring it back and take the fiveyard penalty I had that happen to me one time the offensive lineman moved we blocked the kick touchdown brought it back the last five yards they bootless for ten minutes but except in the penalty was there a lot of opposition to that no I think it day is the best rule I really do first and 15 Marino this time the protection breaks down and Danny goes down at the 28 yard line John Cameron led to charge number 94 so the Syracuse defense which has been very porous this season averaging 27 points a game handling itself extremely well to this point they give him some different looks to Marino he's not quite sure where he wants to go with the football on his passes he stopped yourself you get a penalty al and you stopped yourself unless you can make the big play situation definitely favors the defense second down and 20 Marino time again but overshoots everybody and it's intercepted back into 17 Lag is dropped at the 22 yard line so the interception by Warren Pennsylvania now that maybe the new rule tackling with your head that is something that the college people put in the rule book of tackling with your head but I'm not sure I didn't see the penalty at all there are two flags though we look at a clip clip it on the run back let's watch it from the insole Marino overthrew the receiver by at least six feet let's watch it to the right of your screen receiver wasn't open there he overthrows him and Harvey makes a heck of a catch going back to his goal line let's see if we can identify the person who Clips still comes back in the left of you picked you watch the block that Harvey does not see still he's way over on the left coming into your picture Wow that's dangerous so a couple of flags apparently bold for the same infraction in the ball back to the eight yard line first down Syracuse hit leading 76 914 to go first half monkey motion facemask al yep you can see the reaction by for your FB number 68 so this will give Siragusa brain to grow eggsy March it out to the 23 yard line the facemask infraction and the orange with the first down 23 Gregg Meisner the five defensive tackle has not returned to the game out buck law was playing defensive left time Mandeville out to the 45 yard line Syracuse has stayed right with a game plan to keep the ball make some first downs high percentage plays low risk do anything but kick the ball to Pittsburgh the difference in the game for Penn that run back by we offensively they've been stymied as Syracuse is dominated in time of possession second down and eight and explores one other ball carrier in Syracuse history that would be zhanka Michigan out in felon a field goal second period leading the Badgers three nothing Michigan pulled out one last week did they last play of the ballgame a 50yard pegs they not only went to the back of the PlayBook they went to the back of the rulebook didn't even attempt the extra point very that abounds after 33 and it's Jojo he jackie sherrill saying after watching the films of syracuse it Hurley has great little regard for his own body he's the type of fella that if he needs that first down he'll give it all he's got and the consequences well don't think about it later Virginia and on top of Georgia 7nothing in the first quarter nonconference game the Bulldogs are unbeaten in the SEC Dean of a yard or so it'll be second down and nine going back to her they jackie sherrill said he had never seen a quarterback throw his body around my field Hurley does just disregard you can see that Chicano is not the only injured member of a Pittsburgh team this week second down joejoe he put the pressure on as chrisberg team with a safety blitz that time and jerry Boyarsky able to pick up the fumble at the 27 yard line you could see it coming out from up period early was looking to his right Heath was Blitzen from the opposite side and early had no idea that he was going to hit him let's watch it from the endzone Harley's roll into the right fakes let's watch it and there is he 36 strips him of the ball what an outstanding play 658 to go in the half Panthers by a point your Kmart Automotive Center is your sound shop to save $30 on this am/fm

takes the man who recovered the fumble jerry Boyarsky number 68 talk about icing up the bruise and get it up there for the whole line 21 yard line Randy McMillan stop by jim common ground level look here at McMillan has really filled a void for Pittsburgh they had a lot of problems ensuring rdik situations last year went to the JC ranks and McMillan's been a key part of their offense with 230 pounds let's watch him run the draw play synthy lowers his shoulder how much Jordan he gets after he gets hit about 3 yards that's what a fullback must do on second down they give it to McMillan again who gets inside the 20 to the 19 yard line bamboo leading Texas A&amp;M 73 in the second quarter the heart of Bob Miller to palpitate Harvard but I need 32 and Benji Pryor is back in a tight end oh all right rel Hawkins his second carry stopped at the line of scrimmage so again hit his face with a fourth down situation they had fourth and one to drive to go and cut it then on a lash dry they had to fourth that place went for both and were able to pick up the first on each occasion now they have a fourth and two they go for it on 4th the fete and then Marino throws he's been inside the number 44 Freddie Jacobson Valen his first play of the day finding the couch and getting the first down courageous call last confidence for freshmen in a freshman Moreno faked off tackle and through Lou Jacobs in the plan let's watch the feet that's what holds a linebacker you're gonna see him fake right there rolled to the lamp Jacob's thumb aborted floor is open in the flat good throw right on the numbers first down the nose of the ball is just inside the 10 so its first and goal and the pitch is juggled by Hawkins but he turns it into a small game alright well stop ball a Dean eight and a half stop ball a Dean eight and a half this is a toughest place to get a first down I used to hate to get a first down on the 10yard line that yards young run is just precious to that defense second and goal the power again for the handbags to go on the halfplane mic the brass it was there one of the two times now still would be a fearful if I were syracuse without getting some rush maybe on this the end of the field you can see that marino is going to fake and he has plenty of time to pick up the crossing in but that quick release did you see that out a quickie just rifle the ball in the dubrovsky could not hold onto couldn't control it third down and goal marino still has time Ralph still the Panthers leading receiver let's watch it on the split screen you'll see there was a safety blitz mantoman somehow Syracuse was confused no uncovered still wide open for the touchdown so still the man who took Gordon Jones is spotted wide receiver his sixth touchdown catch of the year Schubert's extra point attempt is good so the Panthers are up by 8 for 22 to go first half at the stadium it's been 14 sir to 6 good year tiempo official tire of the 1980 Winter Olympics brings you

the Panthers David trout Morrison month back for Syracuse and it's bunk at the three brawling down any gum but he went down that was the end of the play you don't have to be tackled there touchdown he went not in college football here is the touchdown and you will notice how wide open still is you'll see number three Harvey coming across trailing in but evidently had missed his assignment right there you can see number three Harvey behind in but he's way out of the play easy touchdown and Harvey was the man who intercepted the pass earlier in the quarter as you look at the man who just put six on the board for the Panthers 14 to 6 it's bird raining Sarek use in a whole again at the two yardline man to those vaults the yard or maybe to record Lucy defensive strategy here is get into a goal line defense there similar to what you would play if you backed up your own two yard line and that's what Pittsburgh is doing all eat off of right in the gaps on second down they give it to Mars if it's something they're handy Monday Night Football a good one nine o'clock Eastern Time the Houston Oilers Earl Campbell against the Miami Dolphins Bob Griese is back can you imagine a repeat of last just what I was told asleep what a game they've had last year by the most exciting game I've ever witnessed terrestrial football campbell ran wild it's time to dolphins get up at home in Miami dirty early keeping and spinning and getting to the seven yard line so the clock is running 307 306 and counting down and Syracuse will have to give it up it's going to put up a very bad field position with three minutes to to 54 left and Moreno at quarterback they can get him on oh no John like to kick slight wind in his back Jojo heating and field to receive for the Panthers a low end over end kick and he'd soon have a decent run back inside the 45 the 40 spending to the 36 to 236 and they're in good shape penalty out for up piling older than the 30 rough piled on and so that'll put Pittsburgh and even better shape the kick was 39 yards but it was a line drive the type of you can normally run back the Johnny majors in Iowa State then came here under majors when Johnny had great success then Jackie spent one season at Washington State coaching there in 1976 while majors was winning his national championship here at Pittsburgh and they took over when Johnny left for Tennessee let's see if we can't see the penalty detecting detect exactly who had washed Heath number 36 returning the punt gets caught right over on the boundary you'll see that he gets pushed out of bounds he loses his balance a little bit and can't stop and number 30 ruff comes right in basel out of bounds 20yard line Jacobs to the 11 inside the 11 might have a first down Payan rooster Jones bossy a lot of action and Jacob shaken up on the play now do you write McMillon 240pound philipot has made a big difference in the pittsburgh office in these first seven games powell runners what they had missed last year Jakob's picks up the first first down just outside the tent to the five came up to make the stop number 18 how are the Seminoles doing today Florida stayed unbeaten and leading Cincinnati seven nothing with Lehigh leading CW Post 14 nothing in the second quarter second down they can't pick up a first time without the touchdown Macmillan two colleagues 33 in on the stop a little bit ahead of schedule they had first and ten on the ten and a half and then two downs they picked up seven yards you won't three or try a minute and a half to go if they need them the Panthers have all of their timeouts left hit leading 46 Moreno and a DeBartolo involved in his first play of the day and his for six points excellent call its repeat of the touchdown before just a different receiver dan Marino has now thrown six touchdown passes this season remember today his first start because of the injury to Ficano sherbert to attempt the extra point out of scotch hole and the kick is good so they take over in great field position exploit it 1:15 to go in the half it's 21 to 6 Pittsburgh the 1980 semi Monza 2 plus 2 standard engines of gas stretching for standard transmissions for on the floor an EPA estimates sure to please the mileage is 22 mpg knees but older now there's even more 35 the highway score a good quarterback does its homework on and off the field that's probably one of the three of us are all drinking lot beer from Miller you lights got a third less carriage than the regular beer and it's less filling plus it tastes great and you know it's important to have a command of facts like that it's middle discipline really you're darn right cuz if you know every position every option and every formation you'll never get your signals crossed that's my beer turn everything you always wanted in a beer unless peel my label this fall is the second year of competition for 38 schools in the NCAA's new division one doublea football group Florida A&amp;M defeated Massachusetts for the initial championship last year and the 1979 season climaxes with the title game December 15th to be covered by ABC Wayne DeBartolo who got the touchdown to make it 21 to 6 his trap kicks off a line drive from the to ecom's accident in 1523 abandoned as we John when you faked that close to the goal line a running play you're gonna freeze everybody and you can see how wide open DeBartolo as we watch it from the ground level let's see what you do is he fakes to the tailback rolls out turns his shoulders excellent throw and good concentration by the Portola one team to go in the half and the orange have to move 76 yards getting out of bounds so at least he cites the clock loser 380 play Steve Fidel there to drive him out Michigan has increased its advantage 17 nothing over Wisconsin in the second quarter rocket yeah unbeaten scoreless with Cornell in the second longtime coach at Dartmouth then in Illinois and back to the Ivy League has done a great job this year at Cornell second and 14 early his first bottom of the day is almost intercepted but they intended receiver and back there covering was Terry white he's been all over the feet got some youngsters if we recognize this in coach you just have the ability to view around the people some of them around it others are in white Tiffany is around the football coming up following this one Stanford Arizona State most of you will see that one from Palo Alto key battle in the pac10 those of you in Philadelphia well you'll take a look at what the weather's like in Honolulu today via satellite Hawaii and temple danny moreno the freshman quarterback who's thrown two touchdown passes today on third and 14 they'll let boys try to pick up the first down and he will be considerably shy he gets back just about to the original line of scrimmage it'll be fourth and 10 now we'll see if pick decides to take a timeout on defense knowing at Syracuse he's gonna have to putt but the Panthers have not opted correction on the score Yale is leading Cornell tend to nothing clocks still running here meanwhile 2423 now pip takes its time on and the Panthers cross themselves about 20 seconds that time by electing very late to call the timeout the jackie sherrill is really upset that is kept in the summer didn't follow instructions he the parents that I could guess from reading his face this he claimed that someone to go in and call timeout immediately after the third down play that's the scarf they wasted 20 seconds as you mentioned you bet they would have had 42 or 43 seconds if they to call the timeout earlier but right now they've got 22 seconds of course the point and possible run back will eat up a few more ticks back deep George oh he standing at his own 35 and the punter John White sherek is recovering it's the putter whoa wait gets out to the 40yard line what a productive Syracuse Ricky Jackson was the man who came in johnboy locket let's watch Ricky Jackson make us superior effort right here coming from the left on the screen number 87 slow kicking the ball watch him leave his deep block it but watch the kicker white picked the ball up react just instinctively and make the first out I've never seen that I can never remember seeing this they may have found another running back the way white moved on that one eleven seconds remaining in the half and Syracuse still in possession Miami shocking Penn steam early leading by three Happy Valley is not particularly happy at the moment now Syracuse takes a timeout to figure out how you're going to move 60 yards just to recap that first quarter Syracuse I'll first a get a good job with a game playing at the head of foam blue bar the two publicist being pittsburgh opportunities like they would have had otherwise early from the 40 he's going to keep it trying to get out of bounds and dud seconds Syracuse is pass offense isn't what we would call the sophisticated where you drop back and you could pick the oak and receivers more than roll out it's difficult to him you had a long yardage to write record a hamper then the game to get to be and open because you've only got one or two receivers the quarterbacks role in that direction and you can cover this could be the final play of the half with five seconds remaining is 21 to 6 Pitt and Morris will be stopped at the 46 yard line thinking something the Panthers seeking their sixth consecutive win Saturday on the Roper Stanley starts a fire moves in with the Brooks putting Jeffries fire out for good then on detective school debate set for a killer stocking a panty Fashion Show and it's a special night on The Love Boat when the captain's past catches up with him are you gonna tell me about that I wants her daddy back then on Fantasy Island an old flame returns to stay and the boss gets his ultimate fantasy tonight well you saw these scores the correct one the Michigan 17 nothing over Wisconsin at the half so the 10th rated Wolverines in good shape and the University of Pittsburgh marching band under the direction of Don Hauer the orange to kickoff as we begin the second half it's Jojo he's number 36 back deep for the Panthers and Timothy Lewis back on the five with him as Gary Anderson takes off for the orange so in the second half underway it's 21 to 6 Pittsburgh and it's Lewis who will come out to the 10:15 and back to the 20yard line so the Panthers taking over there against this Syracuse defense John Cameron the left end that a good first half Connors is the left tackle number 83 they've got Chris Shaffer and John Kenley it right in a fourman front with three linebackers Mike zoo nakhon the outside number 48 there's their best defensive player Jim Collins 33 all over the field and Tony Siebert on the right side Moreno as we start the second half goes right to the air so balls was open had it in his hands couldn't hold it Cedric Hinton the left cornerback Warren Harvey had an interception in the first half Mike Bogosian is the strong safety and their best defensive back is that man Bob Arkell Payne 2nd down and 10 Panthers from the 20yard line roaster Jones Rainey Macmillan are the running backs Moreno they protect him well Jones $22 Dan Marino the freshman quarterback in place of the injured cercano they have Jones and the Quillen the running backs poles who dropped to pass and still who caught a touchdown pass the wide receivers with Gruber fiddler grim Boras and May up front Benjie Pryor was hurt in the first half but came back to play in the second quarter and starts the second as he incomplete three consecutive plays Moreno dropped straight back into the pocket the club will begin the second half let's watch Moreno drop back to pass the third two consecutive time first three plays of the head and you'll watch his arm up in the air when Kendall in number 43 knocks it loose incomplete not a fun Dave tried to take it away not a particularly good kick and a fair catch called for juggled and read 48 yard line by Arco Fame up front there is you green allamerica listed as the left family placed several positions Misner was heard first half Boyarsky recovered a photo of the first half they've got Bill Neal on the right side and opposite green or Ricky Jackson number 87 offensively with a legal procedure drew Kissinger was the man who jumped off as you look at Pelosi a linebacker in the middle number 51 mark Rikard the other linebacker for the Panthers and in the secondary you've got Colin Williamson the strong safety al Syracuse had lost the ability to pass and in the second quarter he goes with it you automatically lose ability to run against a good defense like Pittsburgh the Panthers yielding only 2.2 yards per rush coming into the game on 1st and 15 it's Joel Morris who gets out of bounds at about midfield Lynn Thomas was there to make sure he did not advance any further and right now Morris is closing in on Jim Brown rushing figure at Syracuse Larry Csonka is their alltime rushing leader and Morris is just three yards shy of equaling Jim Browns yardage total pretty good company second and 12 incomplete I intended receiver with a flower in Bushman number 29 the rest of the backfield for the Panthers defensively so a white who ran the kickback for the score Lynn Thomas at the right corner and Jojo heat the free safety number 36 he set up their first touchdown by the offense the second touchdown with a blitz and forced the quarterback early to fumble the ball he also inadvertently set the fire return that's another story third down and 12 from the 49 yard line he's pursuing early all right pop was the intended receiver but you've got you green bearings empathy all you want to do is get rid of the ball you run a little fast yep you definitely run fast you green number 99 we've talked about you quite a bit those of you who follow college football know that I'm gonna be several allamerica teams last year and will probably be a threetime allamerican by the time he's done John White the punt into a very light breeze and out of bounds it goes inside the 20 we'll see where they Park it they may bring it out and they do to the 21 his word went out so first down for the Panthers on their own 21 yard line now pittsburgh has had very little rushing yardage all year in the first half they rushed for 40 for 39 yards and only 39 43 passing for a total of 82 that's far below the average and yet they lead by 15 capitalizing on breaks McMillon 24 yard line it'll be second down Chris Shaffer tackle to carry over that I'm sure jackie sherrill feels like this team is getting through rely too much on the past and when you do you lose the run and then you get in serious trouble coming into the game the Panthers Clemson routing Wake Forest coming into the game Pittsburgh with more yardage passing this season then running second and seven time permitting after the game and of course we're over the second half of our doubleheader today Stanford Arizona State for most of you and for those in Philadelphia temple and Hawaii analog for stepping away from trouble and try complete Mike Dombrowski number 82 taking the cash now he showed a lot of poise he had a rush coming from his backside and some sun receivers pastors can just feel it you can see Kinlan number 43 rushing he sidesteps and very calmly rifles the ball right in good throw for the first down the Panthers at the 34 first and 10 and on a draw nothing doing Bartolo it's his first carry of the day but he's already caught a touchdown pass Florida State having problems restriction Addie they look real good last week against LSU and sometimes you have a letdown after a big way in Baton Rouge Bearcats leading by a touchdown in the second quarter second and ten Syracuse X 1152 go in the third quarter at the 26yard line it's totally number four one three we got in there the 62 206 pounds senior from western New York and he was a linebacker as I mentioned earlier with four seven speed and coming from the backside he can do damage but Allen continued on that philosophy about the run trapano is an option quarterback and Moreno is not and when you fail a run the option you can the defense can crowd you and do a good job of stopping your running game third and 17 rooster Jones next mr. job the ball carrier and the piece of punting unit to make the tackle so nothing cooking on that offensive shavers from Pittsburgh and David's out to kick it away they're starting out just like they did in the first quarter they did not make a first ban on the first play this is two possessions with the wind no first down all right muck back to receive the kick and arts gonna call for the fair catch at the 41yard the Syracuse Orangemen will start this Drive from the 41 yard line with 10 minutes and 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter in pitch Stadium it's Pittsburgh 21 Syracuse 6 Syracuse at the 41yard line first and ten 1044 to go third quarter Pitt leading by Medivh and it's Joe Morris making the tackle now since the first quarter Syracuse has done very little offense when I think the reason is that Hurley has completed two out of six passes for over 25 yards what happens is Pittsburgh defense crowds roll very difficult block Levin in close to the line of scrimmage Marsh just bashing Tim Brown and career yardage only a sophomore on second down early the big field appears to be just shy of the first down Ricky Jackson and it looks like it'll be third down and less than er one thing that we're missing is the outstanding play of new green and I think simply they are audible izing oh wait from green and running to the opposite side on most of the plays can you blame them no sir I cannot green the left side defensively this time and it looks like they may have stopped Mandeville Kenny fried to get through the middle Jeff Belushi came up there to plug the hole and we'll see where they give him forward progress they put it down at the 49 yard line and they'll bring in the chains was an excellent play by pollution Lucey number 51 let's watch him here's a dog it's a short yardage and he's gone a red shirt watch him he times it beautifully he shoots a gap watch he put his head in and the help comes up while he's got a hold of him and man the veal cannot fall forward for the extra yardage you can see Bill Hurley took a close look at that died by an inch or two and when you're down by 15 at midfield and forth that and you've got a post offense the call is easy and with a running quarterback that's an extra dimension that the defense have to account for the option for fourth down and itches Mandeville and Morris in the running backs early will keep it himself and lunges forward to pick up the first down that's the safest playing football for two inches if the center is not covered Pittsburgh was haven't even sent out two guards over the guards and there was a little Running Room a little daylight and Hurley just jump right through it in that situation if a man does line up over the center do you like to see the quarterback audible eyes yes Archie hot brother hand it to the fullback first down out of the eye from the 48 Morris racked up at 250 is the only one person can make a play like that green let's watch the tackle on the line of your screen all tackle playing green comes in and there's that arm right Wow you green from Natchez Mississippi mom died when he was a youngster raised by his aunt just the junior second and 11 Pearlie he's got some room good pulls inside the 30 of the Panthers Terry White dropping him you could see on that play that Pittsburgh was going to rush they had everybody close to the line of scrimmage and Hurley just split the guards down that's what happens sometimes when you rush the injured Panther was the man who made the tackle number 23 Terry white so we have 802 remaining in the third quarter Pittsburgh leading Sharik use 21 to 6 new kodak instant color film and the drama club a ride it maybe not let's see stay in a mustwin pac10 battle with Stanford or simple Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC Terry white is that a lot of good things happen today and some that have not been so good white the injured Panther and we'll see if we can he check it out there he is underneath and then some of his teammates fell across his leg and many times in my experience falling across the legs caused more than the interest and anything else meanwhile first down Syracuse from the 32 is Joe Morris tries blank over and gets for the 29 yard line Neal and Pulu si making the tackle Malusi in on the play again and we have hemline isolated let's watch his role he just spots a play he wasn't blocked and a good linebacker forces into the line of scrimmage and that's what Pulu si did but short yardage second and seven at the 29 Syracuse trailing 21 six tomorrow on the pitch and he gets to the 23 yard line and comes up gimpy let's watch what happens to a quarterback when he runs option play and you blitz ends he's going to fake to the fullback up hill and then watch Ricky Jackson hit him right there Hurley was lucky but quick hands allowed him to get the ball picks back to Morris with a nice game punished he came out of that at least in better shape and Morris but Maura stays in on third down and warm from the 23 the fake the mandevilla burly keep smash the first down get to the 16 yard line he has really taken some shots not only today but throughout his career there he is getting up slowly he just throws his body around in most quarterbacks don't do that and most coaches don't want their quarterback to do it because of the entry factor and he was injured as you mentioned early the show on the first series in this first game last year and was given a hardship and this is his fifth year playing for Syracuse first out of the 17 Morris got a half a yard report from the panther bench the defensive back Terry White with a sprained ankle incurred making a tackle and with white out of the lineup in the defensive backfield Thomas's brother I think Lin Thompson's brother Wallace Thomas is in their number nine that's right they've got both Thomas's in their litt number three and wallace thomas they call him Pepe and that'll pass the ghoul of Mississippi second down and came from the seventeen muck is in motion dives to the eight yard line so Hurley is about a yard short of the first and Miami still leads Penn State by three two lame leading Boston College jail trying to stay unbeaten and Harvard for the baseball score six to two over Brown halftime Dartmouth by seven at Princeton at Penn or tied in the second quarter as are the you and Holy Cross third Gavin one early a keeper again the flesh down and out of bounds at about the it was just perfect execution against the Blitz the corner fire and the Hurley just kept inside this watch his judgment here's a youngster in a split seconds got to decide what to do with the ball he turned right back up inside makes a nice cut big play his second big play in the series at the goal second and ten scrambling for nine yards setting up this goal line thrust first and goal Syracuse from the two for 37 to go third quarter out of the straight tip it leads 21 to 6 and Hurley what keeps perfectly the pitch and he's in for the touchdown dill Hurley that drive just about a oneman show just excellent performance by Bill Hurley the key as a coach you fully appreciate the decisions he had to scramble his receivers were covered he runs option play three times in critical situations keeps sidestep darts up and keeps the drive boiling with making yardage for the first down just a fine performance on his part it's 21 to 12 they're gonna line up for the extra point anyway what do you think Frank a fake yeah well I don't know I think they'll kick this one and then decide for a field goal opportunity and a touchdown later on the extra point would put them within E and Anderson's kick is good for 33 to go in the third quarter it's not 21 to 30 nears the TD by Hurley again from the ground hold the option play early is unaccounted for the goal line defense no one has it he just trots into the end zone for 33 to go third quarter it's pit by eight put Delta in deep flashes out forget about those washes you used to worry about don't worry free faucets ask a plumber for us Delta and LX faucets no washers no washer worries who's the symbol of good customer care mr. Goodwrench who stands for GM dealers commitment to improving service and over 6,000 participating dealerships whose face is seen nearly everywhere look for him he wants to show you he cares about you and your GM car football safety is a big concern to coaches fans and participants by using approved equipment and learning the correct blocking and tackling methods the risk of injury can be minimized the NCAA is working to prevent injuries help us be successful Jojo heat back deep along with Tim Lucas therapy Anderson Freddie the kickoff now they say go ahead Bansi dump at the 19 yard line for the Panthers who sputtered in the first quarter and have been sputtering here in the third quarter offensively we'll try to get something going if Syracuse is pulled right back into it it's 21 to 13 Panthers give some credit to the Syracuse defense which was very suspect and ineffective you men up into this ball game but they've been outstanding against this Pittsburgh offense Nebraska leading Missouri's 7 nothing in the first quarter first down out of the from the 19 yard line Marino pitching it back to Fred Jacob who has dropped down at the 22 a gain of three john Kinley keep rolling question is can anybody get within 50 of Ohio State these days look at this one he'll since in that at 21 Florida State 7 all the scores time permitting on our Prudential College School Board following the game it is second down and seven from the 22 they slot Benjie prior and then put him in motion jumping off on the left side was Gruber number 64 so the play whistled dead before its inception you you can believe that jackie sherrill is fuming the Pittsburgh team has lost their momentum and not quite as enthusiastic as they were early in the ball game they've had some bad things happen they're worried they have some doubt and that you can see it now is they take the huddle and they come out something Goods got the happen for them to get that enthusiasm back Syracuse has the momentum right now absolutely coming up next an furred against ASU most of you will see that those of you in Philly temple against Hawaii Moreno protected well to Jacobs who makes a catch up to 20 and is out of bounds at about the 23 well the Panthers started the year with a win over Kansas and they lost to North Carolina then they built back up to the point where last week they beat an unbeaten Navy team the midis unbeaten coming in 24 to 7 and as you say Frank perhaps a bit of a letdown today they did not seem to be emotionally charged and are very fortunate to have to lead by 8 at this point pretty much give it to return third and five the screen is said Cola 3035 Syracuse territory and tackled from behind Cedric Hinton able to catch up with them so DeBartolo involved in his second big play of the day the other pants reception was for a touchdown that was beautiful execution on the screen because Marino sets it up beautifully you think he's going to throw downfield there was a blitz off and DeBartolo catches the ball watch him stay inside the worst thing to do on the screen is get over on the bound and get pushed out finally gets caught from behind 36 yard gain to the Panthers at the 40 of Syracuse balls in motion and Jacobs abort failure runs into college columns number 33 Mike Johnny jumping out that run ouch on that screen should have fired up the Pittsburgh offensive unit again something like there the big play that gets them in scoring territory a little more enthusiasm second down and 8 to 40 to go third quarter 2113 Pittsburgh Moreno to the air on second down and eight what's the skill great catch at the 5yard line Barca Fame covering Ralph still handing on his fingertips and able to hold on just a sensational play any way you look at it that's a sensational troll and just as remarkable of catch the concentration by a young now still was just unbelievable let's watch still he's going to go in and force to the corner forced to the goal line that back to the corner watch his concentration right here holes all good and control to just before he goes out of bounds and as the Panthers start to come up with a first and goal they call a timeout so they'll get this serie straightened away 207 remaining in the third quarter that's pitch first timeout of the half Michigan rolling leading Wisconsin 33 nothing so they eat one out over Indiana no problems today Miami still with the lead over Penn State 13 to 10 in the second quarter Monday night nine o'clock eastern time on ABC good matchup Earl Campbell in the Houston Oilers greasing in the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football outstanding attraction this week again just look back to last year's confrontation in the dome what a night that was look at the sideline shot Moreno he's about 64 weighs 200 pounds and has got a slingshot forearm mechanically the coaches say he's just unbelievable for a freshman in his mechanics and throw the ball footwork whatever it takes went well you know his big question in the future Frank will be football or baseball he may be a Heisman Trophy candidate someday if he keeps going like this as a freshman he just remarkable fourth round draft pick by the Kansas City Royals on a high school first down goal from the five Jacobs in motion they give it to DeBartolo to the 433 in an attacker what you bet they go back to the past that they throw twice the touchdowns in the first half just the halfback out in the flat after fake into the tailback is really difficult to cover in college you got ananth man the fake will hold on safety an orbiter let's see if they throw it to take their system line up in the power I on second and goal rooster Jones looking for a black cuts inside wait be Bartolo was the man who sprung up so the Panthers ahead by only eight had stretched it out to 14 here it is the pic sweet back away from the formation DeBartolo 31 has gone throw the key block and rooster Joel sees daylight and he heads for the goal line and makes it so the Panthers with Mark Schubert lining up for the extra point see the call we have illegal procedure against Syracuse that'll move it after distance and let's see what jackie sherrill decides to do they'll still go for a one Jenner holding a Schubert stick is good so forty three thousand five working on it Stadium the Panthers in their final appearance 1979 with a minute a half remaining in the third quarter Pittsburgh out in front of Syracuse 28 to 13 as we check out the left side of the Panther line grooving number 64 and Finland number 62 watch them make the technique block of reaching out and scooping and holding the the brush Bingham 82 makes the block kick out block and look at the hole you could drive a truck through that's what good Blanca does Beck's like to see that out and DeBartolo turkish man totally out of the picture that defender never made the replay the travel of kickoff for Pittsburgh a man in the hands to go in the third quarter and the Panthers leading sir accused 28 to 13 right but Warren Warren er back for Syracuse line drive kick fifteen buck to the 30 and slides out at the 31 yard line so the Orangemen of syracuse taking over from here is to lane 33 nothing yale trying to stay unbeaten 11 over cornell in the third first down at the 31 morris just about back to the line of scrimmage we are ski number 68 was there was he there yeah 275 pounds nose guard and jackie sherrill told me that he can control the truck and the middle of the line and they respect the tacos protect wide second and ten Syracuse in the 31 under a minute to go in the period early makes the catch of the deflected pass Carlton Williamson and he's been able to pick that off that would have been six more for Pittsburgh let's watch monk run the pattern he's in the wing back position he's just slanting out in the flat and the Williams 11:48 turns in chases in the shadows and watch him go up he goes right through Williamson's hands but look at the concentration of luck he's an outstanding receiver already holds career interception records for Syracuse it's third down and one from the 40 early is three out of eight through the air today and the orange pick up the first down as Mandeville moves through the middle al is a third quarter closest Syracuse rushed for 183 yards which is more than double than the other six teams have rushed in the entire game mainly 91 that's riping is coming in the Panthers remember had yielded only 2.2 yards first out of 10 boorish on a play that will close out the third quarter they stopped at the line of scrimmage rather stop carrying officials have stopped the clock and now starting it again and so that will do it for the third quarter it'll be second and ten for Syracuse when the fourth period gets underway so at the end of three in pitch Davion Mitchell Peters 28 and the RS 13 TV in the city of Champions Pittsburgh Stadium in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Al Michaels and Frank Broyles as we start the fourth quarter Pittsburgh leading Syracuse 28 to 13 Syracuse from its own 43 yard line its second down and 10 and early on a roll under some pressure he's going to keep it and brought down at the 47 yard line your green number 19 making the play green is the type of fella who could play several positions look at the stats Syracuse 18 first downs 210 for Pittsburgh rushing Pittsburgh only 47 yards total offense 174 but they've had one good drive of 80 yards and too many drives in a punt return Syracuse big edge time of possession that on the scoreboard it's 28 to 13 Pittsburgh third down and six from the 47 with monk in motion early coming back the other way they set up a nice screen and getting into Pittsburgh territory inside the 40 the 30 and brought down to the 25 is the tight end Tony Snyder number 81 now I can only ten years of color 30 when you spray on a tie in he's lost he is the toughest thing to cover in football this is a throwback screen to the tidy and watch how wild this he is acting first he's going to block read then he lets it go and then course is going to be no one here as you see Santa has one man to get away from he's blocked by one of the Lions and any very wisely stays inside the boundary makes whatever he can excellent call and perfect execution first answer refused at the 24yard line bunk in the slot to the right early pitching the Morris and down to the 19 yard line I agree with you that tylium screen is a great play why don't we see it more often I don't know that's one thing I don't think my team's ever covered they might throw it away or something like that but that was good at on this last play was perfect execution option play and the old man is saving some score was Jojo heat the free safety he filled the hole and stopped it for a 7 yard game the rock it's a tough play Virginia leading Georgia at the half 10 to nothing the Bulldogs only play well in their own conferences and they have tied for the lead in the Southeastern Conference for vixx's no defeat second down and three from the 17 inside the 15 ghost Mandeville he is close and I think just a little short of the first down he is short now Syracuse is using something a half million years on eightman offensive level and that was the defensive me if they've got all eaten alive screaming no flank on two running backs in a quarterback they've used that on short yardage no get worse times during the game they fit fair effective for and here they have a third down coming out of yep they send two men wide this time on third down and less than a yard Turley keeps and has the first down get into the fourth game they are ski made the stop he can't count Syracuse after you are inviting enough he'll battle most of the way they're down by 15 but mounting a good Drive here and a first down at the 13 yard line you've got to give this offensive unit of Syracuse credit because they're going to get small the top defensive teams in America and they've kept their pores and discs good for the Knitting as we say in Cote 12:55 to go early tenyard was you green who came in to make the tackle he was lined up as a linebacker old that particular point green we started to mention before not only plays a lot of positions defensively but look at him he's the type of guy he could be a quick split end maybe even a tight end probably a basketball player how about a fullback you name it he's just a great athlete strike like a Cobra second down and seven are in motion and Hurley click out complete no one official started to market five and the other said no sir aren't bunked the receiver I don't know really which one you would go buy one did call it as you mentioned al another called it incomplete let's watch it for mins on see if we can detect the is it illegal pass or isn't pretty close pretty close I believe the man that called it complete had our view from the Enzo and I believe that it was complete but it's third down and seven instead early turns it inside leaps in for the touchdown play you gotta like that and as we mentioned before jackie sherrill said the pit coach after watching films he doesn't care about his body at all he proved it on that play he'll the scouts up in the press box had to call that play they went in the same formation that they went on the previous play Pittsburgh moved all the way over and he ran the option play back way from the short side of an unbalanced line and scored what an effort by Hurley so the crowd has been stilled it's 28 to 19 and now they're going to go for two with 1156 to go see if he runs the option again monk in motion early on a roll throws complete for the two points to monk so they close to within seven don't count the orange out and 11:56 to go in Pittsburgh it's the Panthers 28th Syracuse 21 Sugar Ray Leonard Olympic champ now undefeated bro this month egos for the big one the WBC welterweight championship on ABC 11:56 to play 28 to 21 Pittsburgh with the orange to kick off Gary Anderson the potent light rays in his back Joe Joe heat things up and then let's it go through the end zone for the touchdown once again here is the touchdown watch Pearlie hurdle in this much is an option plate to the short side unbalanced rot and the reason is successful Pittsburgh had moved all of their defensive end over with month going in motion and it was a great call by the Syracuse day who would thoughts you run an option played the short side of the unbalanced line for 10 yards in a touchdown 69 yards took a couple of ticks over three minutes to do it 28 to 21 Panthers from the 20 its rooster Jones has a bank hole 30 and out to the 37 yard line 17 is rough it's 15 the right cornerback made the tackle this burg needed that particular run they needed something to get him started again more a big play like that didn't help all of the 38 first and 10 no one's again for a yard christine bourie made the tackle let's go back into the twopoint conversion the pants come on fans watch 45 the wide receive in lotion Pittsburgh is gonna bust the defense no one's around wide open two points clock running with eleven ten to go dan Marino the sixth for two hundred pound freshman second and nine Panthers out of the I the I back is Jones I are in motion Jones again his third straight carry and rooster gets belted at the 43 loses the ball syracuse vision if i soul accurately what I thought I saw Jim Connors put a hit on they go back to hell the vote let's watch it from the end zone and see if 33 doesn't knock him loose from the ball that's what we call a take away fumble number 33 goodness he's going to pursue right out of the line keeping leverage then when when Jules turns back Wow and there's the ball right out on the ground and the recovery made by Mike zanuck number 48 so the orange with a first down at the panther 43 yard line they're back in business and it's Morris who gets to the floor you've got to give them a lot of credit for the Syracuse team here's a team that has played all of its games on the road this year Summit neutral sites but every week it's a bus ride or a plane ride and make sure you got your credit cards because they don't have a stadium one is being dealt will play under a dome in 1980 but all from home this year the syracuse back up on the second down and seven at the 40 early at the 37 loose ball but they've got it back Syracuse recovers drew Kissinger on top of it coming up the second half of our doubleheader today from Cano out though it's Stanford and you'll see a good young quarterback in church show nerd against Arizona State those of you in Philadelphia from Aloha Stadium in Honolulu you'll see Hawaii against a good temple team crucial down al third and four third and four from the 37 yard line Pearlie looking and keeping and getting to the 35 yard line so he short by about two Pulu si made the tackle and a big fourth down coming up out he could have run if he had just made up his mind a little faster he'd have made the first down and a walk but he wanted to throw he kept looking for the throw once he decided to run it was too late and short too 35 look at Maloney golly I'm fired up myself huh look at boy if you think he's not fired there's a man who has been under some heats and pressure at Syracuse but done a remarkable job this year all things considered and trying to pull off an upset today fourth and two back timorous doesn't get it they throw him for a loss out of bounds at the 37 yard line Robin Williamson was there to make sure he couldn't turn the corner all right now baloney talking to his defenses they come back in you can't play the option playing appellant Pittsburgh does right here let's watch the first phase the dive back then the quarterback is forced out the line of scrimmage he pitches too quickly forced to by the excellent play of the Pittsburgh defense not the first down very critical day at the 37 the Panthers with a first down and we've got a timeout with 832 remaining 832 left and hit the Panthers lead by 7 three years after the birth of its women's division the NJCAA offers championships in thirtyone sports the NJCAA applauds the junior colleges for expanding opportunities for women in sports Pittsburgh with a ball at their own 37 yard line 8 32 to go the Panthers leading 28 to 21 Marino giving it to Jacobs on a sweep and he runs into a gang at the 38 yard line a gain of 1 second and 9 again in on the stop was John Kinley number 43 he's had an excellent football game not very big for a defensive end but has been quickness and has been able to get involved in the past pound and pass rush and also the squeeks second entity marino complete 2d bipolar to the 42yard Seibert making the tackle so it's third down and the lord 542 tension tied out on top seven nothing third and five and Marino's got the first down our trail stopped at the Syracuse 45 yard line now when you drop back and send out five receivers you're doing two things you're forcing the defense to cover the entire width of the field you'll force them to cover the depth of the field and that's why those short men opening can and Moreno can fire the ball to them for the first down Syracuse almost gives you that short pass because their defensive backs play very soft on the 46 screen to set up its Hawkins again he's got some molds gets from the 34 that's another first half of the Panthers excellent tall scream that you knew that they would I think we all knew that Syracuse was going to put a big rush old and they did and they just got fooled right inside good execution and let's watch Hawkins turn inside then watch the loop right there how about that Oh protect that football leading the game two hands when you get the crowd up to 35 pockets again buried at the 34 yard line clock running six and a half minutes to play as we remember to recap Pittsburgh scored three times the first half once on a punt return once on a fumble and what's on a short kick nothing of their own power they moved 80 yards for their punch down in this half mostly on pass very little running by Pittsburgh second and ten flags are down two of them thrown at the line of scrimmage and the pass complete to Ralph still at the 22 yard line but let's check the pun illegal illegal procedure Pittsburgh you know al I agree with the coaches saying that Marino mechanically is just virtually perfect with his footwork with his arm is quickrelease any young watching this telecast it wants to see perfect mechanics and throwing the football the next time we isolate watches watch out call he stands in the in the pocket break and see it can throw over the defensive rush and when he throws the ball the I cannot cut it's gone his mechanics are just virtually perfect it's second and 15 from the 40 Marino oh pass was right there still couldn't hold on you're not going to see that very much though still was a great high school athlete number 88 he rushed over 200 yards 2,000 yards as a quarterback over 2,000 yards passing and his playing wide receiver and they let him out run his route to the open area he can change him after the defense shows him what the coverage is going to be they just leave that option up to him there are the figures on Marino 17 at a 24 third and 15 from the 40 put some pressure on this time and the pass to the 25yard line deep fryer it is short of a first down so they go to prior and find him but Benji is shy of the first time by a little more than a yard he's got a rifle arm head yeah terrific he just fired the ball right in and the defensive line backers had no chance to go for it with five minutes to play and they get it it's Jacob's carrying to the 21 yard line Brandon name run right over mark Bay 280pound offensive tackle with quick feet something you'll see they'll picture mark Bay number 73 Cincinnati woohoo still leading Florida State 21 7 3rd quarter time committing all the scores on a Prudential College scoreboard following the game first down the 21 yard line Moreno to the air again and Jacobs can't hold on this time one thing that moreno gives you is that great arm but one thing that he does to to the offense he restricts it a little bit since he doesn't run the option plays that Ricardo does so the combination in these last three ballgames if they play pretty affect to be very effective second down and ten from the 21 sir accused so the orange get the break they so dearly me at this point with 432 remaining I feel pain now he pulls out a little bit earlier and the Senate obviously had missed his hands and threw it right back up into her stomach and result of thumb well he was a little anxious to get set up and throw the ball big break for Syracuse Marco Bane recovers and so the orange from their own 23 Brees at their backs four and a half to go hit leads by 7 early to the 26 not used a timeout in this after they have all three remaining differ style of play by Syracuse than Pittsburgh they don't have the time to pass offense now that force you can cover the width and the depth of the field it's all ruled out fast that's right no homerun ball but they've got the time 405 second and seven keeping again just about to the line of scrimmage so it'll be third down and seven did you see Pittsburgh's defense recover that was a just shows of quickness and that's the key to a good defensive team they were circled and they came out the line and held Hurley to a short Dean of parks me yard third down and seven running 322 5 left the ball up at 26 bait early throws over the middle has monofin complete to the 40yard line in the first down for Syracuse why wouldn't you go to the best receiver you've got that's what senior quarterback does watch muck run the path cross the middle he has to sidestep the linebacker Jackson he breaks right across the middle and course Hurley throws the ball between the linebackers where it can't be intercepted in what concentration muck has for the reception controls it beautifully clock running 303 302 remaining in the game first down Syracuse from the 40 we had movement on the left side of the Syracuse line now that's a I would argue with a fifth they penalize Syracuse I would argue with the fishing the defenses and offensive end does not to be stationary he can move any time he wants to that is a mistake now in my opinion there was what here it is we're going to look at the replay the offensive end can move but he is legal to move he can move it's a five inside interior lineman that can't move once they take their place Michels mess out of mouse much as they call it correctly Bologna not particularly happy there's a caution 5 and its first and 15 going be for more and we get a flag there was a wrestling match and let's see who they calling interference it could go either way it could go either way it is on Syracuse a wrestling match as the let's watch it now curly is going to scramble to the right he buys a lot of time and muck is all the way down the field he can't throw the ball that far enough and so they had to come back I guess he interfered with him before SCO died so 45 number 45 apartment he tries to get behind Heath number 36 now let's see what happens they went to death yes there's left are pushed Heath the side trying to make the play so back to the 20 to make it second down and 30 2:33 to go it's a strange call 42nd and 3030 you've got to gain at eight well what ten yards and a wife yeah it's hard to do in the run but I guess they felt like they were 24 with the team defensive team brushing they might have a chance to pop the Blitz tried to go in the element of surprise but they haven't got board started down 26 he's open tackle back at the 18yard line so monk just couldn't get loose to throw it syracuse had was going to throw a lateral let's watch and see just how wide open Siebert number 26 is down the field but monk could not get time to throw the ball there would have been the touchdown that was Haggerty going deep now fourth down and a half a mile it's fourth and 32 and they send in white to kick so they'll putt and then take their timeouts on defense Heath's going to let it bounce and then it's down at midfield so Syracuse opting for the puck he'll take your timeouts now defensively they have a three remaining we have put an 8 to go and hit leads by 7 in a mustwin pac10 battle with Stanford or Central Michigan Toledo and gentle Hawaii check the listings on ABC the Sun Devils and the cards and what should be a great one to offensive power houses out of Palo Alto coming up next for most of you those of you in Philadelphia you'll see temple against Hawaii here its first and ten kid from midfield a minute eight to go the orange have to stop them and then call timeouts Hawkins gets three spend the time I don't I do rapidly they play consumed five seconds and we have a minute three so that's time out number one spent by sir occurs they have two remaining and Pitt will have a second down and seven post Pitt Syracuse will jump right up into the gap they've got everybody on the line of scrimmage and uh what you tell your team here is you protect the football you want over here make some yardage if you possibly can hold on the football both hands make what you can use up as much time jackie sherrill going over the strategy with Dan Marino and Collins the linebacker and one of the captains for Syracuse back with the instructions from Maloney against the suspect Syracuse deepest Pittsburgh was only able to move one his main drive Imola 50 yards for the touchdown 2nd down and 7 from the 47 103 to go and it's our drill Hawkins and he's dropped after he gets about three and a half and Syracuse will use another timeout so that will stop the clock we have 54 seconds remaining and it'll be third down when we come back well there's rector econo the injured quarterback we're in the capitol baseball champion pirates enjoying run enjoying but having an offday hamstring pull he'll be back in a couple of weeks meanwhile 3340 crave he the first time here and they get in its pocket rotates into the 28th Tom Siebert made the tackle our Chevrolet most valuable players in today's game and we've had the slew to choose from we've selected Terry White of the Panthers number 23 the defensive back who ran back the punt for the touchdown Bill Hurley for Syracuse the outstanding option quarterback Bill Hurley keeping them in the game until the very end there is the FB page of the Panthers Terry wait my trill Hawkins the call again stopped at the line of scrimmage when remember Syracuse can only stop the clock one more time we have 21 seconds remaining and that's their final timeout so there is Hurley here's her least stance he's rushed 24 times for 80 yards and 1 TD he pays six times and 13 times six completions for 72 yards 152 yards total offense against some outstanding fit defense can see how distraught early is but I tell you that man is very impressive what a day you got to admire that kid too the way he plays yeah he's he's the heart of that offensive football team and I can see why jackie sherrill has been so concerned of course two years ago when he played he had a great game even though fit pulled it out late in the game and also three years ago in fact he had a low outstanding game that Pittsburgh came from behind the win we had him all the way yeah easy easy to say at this point hardly the case though the Panthers are going to win it but they had to scratch and fight and claw their way to what's going to be their sixth consecutive victory in a 7 and 1 record going into the final three games of the year and Danny Moreno is going to give everybody another thrill by juggling the ball but then recovering it you really just want to fall on it now and let the backs come up if you fumble it make the recovery that's it sorry orange out of timeouts Syracuse and however it's the Panthers who prevail defeat Syracuse 28 to 21 Malati and Cheryl Jackie coming away with win number seven the Panthers win it the final score 28 21 we'll be right back I'm sure LT I feel at home in front of the camera but behind the camera I don't know the difference between
