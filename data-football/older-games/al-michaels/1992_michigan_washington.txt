============================================================

the following is a special presentation of ABC Sports a little sprinkling of crossed over the San Gabriels which loom behind the old Rose Bowl the granddaddy are in Pasadena California sitting in the Aurora sicko and today on ABC Sports the 78 playing of the game matches Washington and Michigan their oneonone against each other in the old Rose Bowl with Washington winning in 78 and Michigan coming back 281 today both teams are very prominent in all the national players and this game will have some meaning before the voting is done you can see how for major poll to write them Washington all stop in two in the other two so what happens here today and in Miami tonight we'll have a great deal to say about which team can vote for the next year weird the game we've been waiting for let's play it Michigan will kick off washing Napolean kaufman and jay baer ERT kicked it off going the Huskies open with a big return of 38 yards and good field position well this is what the University of Washington brings into this ball game and that is speed you see him from the first play of the ball game a huge gap off the middle the kickoff coverage for the Wolverines not there and Coughlin gives them outstanding field position for their first drive maples was the man who saved the touchdown the ball is at midfield it is first down for the Washington Huskies in the white Billy Joe Hobart is the quarterback he turned he fakes he throws it down the fight gets thrown to Pinot plan and about four yards on the play Otis Williams bringing him down Billy Joe Hobart on the season had 22 touchdowns 2,200 but he was picked off ten times meaning he's a big strong guy who'll sometimes force it Dario Bailey had an allamerican season for the Washington Huskies it wide out and the big guys up front the line is anchored by two 300pounders Kennedy a three and a quarter Polamalu at 3:05 on second down and six 15 oh boy a youngster from the Los Angeles area he stopped at the 41 yard line on the Jerry and it'll be third down and one coming up defensively the Michigan Wolverines line up with the Butkus Award winner Erik Anderson at the line backing position this means something because no Michigan man has won an individual award since 1940 Desmond Howard of course was the other man winning individual honors this year the secondary the leader back there is Lance Sutton lanky fellow who is a football player on third down in the yard they give it to flying flying his hammer is it short they've stopped him he stuck his head in the right side trying to find the first down and the Wolverines at the bottom of the pile and you would expect that with you Eric Anderson Anderson has led the team in tackles the last four years he played as a true freshman led the team in tackles every year that he's been there so the Huskies little away that prime field position in the opening possession and Desmond Howard goes back to receive the punt run a job over there that you fake paneer keys a great chance to do it very high wall kick soaring out of bounds in the end zone and Michigan would possess the ball out at the 2041 yard fight and so the Michigan defense comes to the sidelines jacked up by their ability to hold the husky Elvis Grbac look at the last two numbers there twenty four touchdowns and only five interceptions that'll warm the cockles of any coach's heart Desmond Howard of course was the Heisman Trophy winner the Maxwell winner he set all kinds of records and Ricky powers is the man you will see carrying that ball probably a lot today but let's see what happens for Michigan on their first offensive play of the ball game Van Dyne goes in motion to power 27 yard line running over the left side that's where big Greg Scriven act works the offensive front for Michigan is left by scrapping act but a key man here Bob Griese is Matt Elliott he has to move over to the center position because Steve Everett has hurdle a second down and get the first down at the 31 yard line with Ricky powers the 205 pounds sophomore from Akron Ohio carrying the ball for Washington that tackle was made by Jaime fields he's one of a corps of linebackers that can really run the big wrecker inside his feed implements number 90 he spent about eight hours in a hospital the past week trying to get rid of a virus Michigan apparently kitchen one of the key matchups all day will be Steve admin number 90 in the white jersey whomever is blocking him to try and keep him out of there is the almond Award winner the Lombardi Award winner causes the fumble Grbac got it back or were those big offensive line the may be ski nerve Elliot or Chicago you've just seen why Steve implement is considered the premier defensive football player out of the trenches this season turf on gives the power nothing doing 57 Tyrone Rogers right there Donald Jones 48 I mean they have got some assassins left from that deep at the front with us Washington defensive unit defensive unit really attacks Keith it's like an interface they're up mother they're up in the face of the defense with the offensive line they were coming across take a look at the defensive guys the two parters will be assigned to be involved except for the kick return it's set for the second high came whistling in and so the washington defense will leave the field all jacked up let's turn for a moment to Bo Schembechler who is here for this Rose Bowl game as a member of our team coach you've seen both sides play some pretty good defense while Michigan dodged the bullet on that great kickoff return by Washington but they've got to protect the passer if they can't protect the passer it's going to be a long afternoon this will give us even good field position again is Brian heals the punt brings it back to the Michigan side of the field and the Huskies will go to work at about the Michigan's 14th line strengths of these teams or Washington offensively they second in the nation in scoring averaging 42 points a game Michigan number one in the Big Ten against the run and not allowed a rushing touchdown in the last 20 to 40 Huskies come out with a different set fifth part of the picture no backup it's women out there to be told flat five down the sidelines gets it to the 42 where he is taken down by Michigan is done in 243 that memory so they come out with trips to the bottom of the picture and when they did that Keith they substituted three wide receivers Michigan also substituted and went the 60 fence it back picked up Pat Maloney on the tackle Billy Joe Hobart with second down and six now puts Jay berry behind him in the backfield gives the ball to him out of northglenn Colorado will move it across the 40 to about the 38 let's check in now with our colleague Jack arute well Keith earlier in the week there was a heavy rainfall here in Southern California and many people were concerned about the condition of the turf they had it covered in fact it was wet yesterday it's considered fast today because they brought a helicopter in to dry it remember here at the Rose Bowl when the Sun Goes Down this turf gets very very slick from the do it also gets very very cold in the canyon Don James his first undefeated team it is coaching career he rips his way for the first down at the Michigan 28 yard line top runner his daddy O'Dell was a professional football halfback look at the offensive line surge of two backs run number like they're gonna blow the linebacker back on his back at 31 number as Turner and Matt Jones number 22 just run right over the linebacker great blocking by the two backs they line up for the eye Hobart back looks down the pike goes pass it is intercepted go back and take a look at the interception this is what Hobart sees right here nobody in the middle of field it's a double zone now what he's trying to do is get the ball to his tight end down here in the middle but watch this linebacker as he comes over and jams the tight end knocks him off his route and then he can't get down the middle of the field so he throws it drove it to the outside the safety comes back in and Williams makes the interception Otis Williams comes away with the interception and now the Michigan Wolverines possess the football at their own 46 yard line first down no score first quarter 824 to go in the first thirteen strikes in Washington they're the best defense from number fiftyfour David the Putman and I'll tell you folks that is a how do you do when mr. Hoffman leans on after that turnover by Michigan take a look at how the Washington defense has reacted only given us ten points after 20 turnovers by the Washington office that is outstanding the flipside of that knocks him off his track and then he has taken down Hoffman you know we talked about Eric Anderson for Michigan winning the Butkus this man right here is an outstanding linebacker allamerican first team on linebacker he's led to schooler tackles the last two years listen if you looking for linebackers this these two team kept you put Anderson and Hoffman inside together and nobody would dare send back in there he third down seven and Mason right there passes away in pressure pressure pressure in the neighborhood but Andy Mason was right in Grbac space and so it brings up fourth down this game may belong to the defense's they did have some form of double coverage that time on Howard Keith but the out was still there he would have broke to the inside it was double coverage of outside he was alright Ascona is in the Punnett and Beno Bryant is back to taken didn't even sound minutes to go in the first quarter 78 throws bowl game Eddie shaken kicking game edge I would think probably belongs to Washington in this ball game because of what these virtual tournament house which is where the Tournament of Roses conducts its business former private residence here in the City of Pasadena beautiful beautiful setting beautiful city Washington comes up to the line now with Jimmy Harper leading the team of officials from the Southeastern Conference and Billy Joe Hobart turns gets to be known flat and flat side the plantain cut moving slow developing play and at the time he got to where he wanted to be there was nothing to do and son Dodger had a late night last night he's waiting for the fourth quarter he knows how these things go son doctor is his name Alaskan Malamute Gary Moeller in his second season then he has a remarkable record going in nineteen and four back goes bowling on second down and ten Aaron Pierce Patchett Hobart is a big guy he stands six three he weighs a 231 pounds he's a sophomore and if he gets all jacked up and he always is at the start of a ball game I mean he can break your hand well Hobart keith is a sophomore that is the key thing right there he's a lemon and Oh as a starter he has had a great year second in the pac10 in passing but if there is a weakness to this Washington team it's the inconsistency of the quarterback in pass away Lando McKay and it is slapped away and Coleman Wallace doesn't knock it out of his hands he catches it and McKay can fly take a look at the ground level good pressure coming from the left side that's Jamie Burke number seven there's a good shot to play just good defense yep bloody well all right Washington we'll go back to the part where Dell standing up the den we'll hit it around the 14 when Howard is now up at the 30 waiting for fortytwo the 37 that's about a 15 yard punt return by Desmond Howard a grand marshals of the 1992 Tournament of Roses congressman Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado Native American in one of the cars his grace crystal ball tunnel of Spain in the second automobile with his lady and following the grand marshals between her loyal court Queen Tennyson Turrentine of Pasadena maybe the fastest of the Swift and here's your back okay Haley kind of gave us the Heisman step there is the definite done of the highest inking how it tries to give the outside power go another 21 is in good shape Howard makes an F report Bailey is there to get the reflection Bailey gets tripped up now you see this nobody around him Walter could have run a while except he got tangled up in the melee between Howard and Powell Cora and so the first big try involving Desmond goes to Washington this the ball a junior on Los Angeles and he moves it from the nine to about the 11 well if you're wondering about Desmond Howard so far in the ballgame they have double covered him a couple of times they have covered him well deep when Michigan tried to go to it and Washington has cut at the ball to it they're not kicking the ball away from him on punt returns the little man for Washington with S on his chest is number five Mario Bailey he's yet to see the ball he no prize great speed comes riffing and he finds it up room and gets it across the pushdown no and he got in there behind Cunningham intellicus and found this crease he know is the fastest man on this Washington team and they do have some speed up front the blocking is there you see all the Michigan jerseys walledoff a nice game over it back the fire defensive plays I guess who's Eric Anderson number 37 always in the right place at the right time it seems but not only did he read the screen correctly keep and get over there but he fought off the block of one of the offensive linemen he didn't allow himself to be blocked and went up and made the tackle ball rest at the 23 where it is second down and eight no score first quarter hundred pound gets his pastor Mario Bailey is just ripped by : Wallis tomorrow starts a new year right the three hours of all new programming James Earl Jones and Richard Penner burst in pros and cons that an ABC special men and women for shooting Denisov to the limit to the extreme edge followed by Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson on five on ABC for Michigan defense stands tall again Michigan substituting along with Washington when Washington does three wide receivers he's got five and six defensive backs when they gonna run before he's got his run defense in their show the Huskies get one first down but stole and now we're Dallas back to punt and he's having a good day on two kicks dangerous living right here punting to Desmond Howard man no pressure not quite as long as the other and this time Jensen says position don't mess it up bear catch it at the 32 yard line after a 39yard kick the blimp Columbia giving us our picture from the sky today out of Carson California with Charles Russell our pilot and the cameraman is Glenn Hampton at the sky we've got 306 to play in the first quarter and no score in the ball game as the defense is just simply owned everything to this point look at Michigan offense in the Big Ten the quarterback has been sacked only six times I would guess somebody must move because the Huskies came for we have an illegal fatigue hop in illegal Snell 5yard penalty one of my favorite officials gave me heartburn that's the center here that's that Elliot what we used to do that in San Locke you know when we want to pull the other guy off we'd have snap it and put it back and we get all those guys jumping this is reclaimed he's got company miss Cooper the three is an inside linebacker and Hall number five is a 200pound quarterback and it's the third tackle of the ball game for a loss by the Huskies well you wonder about the Husky deep and take a look at this we could have put newer ones up there if we wanted they lead the pack in and every defensive category second down and 17 go deep with it I'll tell you what I don't know that I want my free safety power koa covering Desmond Howard this was it this was in and out coverage this would be regular speed now 15 his Tommy's have been 21 is palco look at him inside out they got him inside out now look he's even with the double coverage inside and out the ball could have been thrown further and have been worth I think you could have run for while rest of the 24yard line it is third down at 17 they're out of the shotgun he is only four four two minutes and 13 seconds to go in the first quarter in no score as Konoha shanked it the last time is in the ticket you know Bryant is back to receive it Husky shouldn't not much pressure high kick and a fair catch fullsize Dino Brian again and it'll be Washington's ball just about their own 46 yard line 1992 Rose Bowl brought to you by Oldsmobile the power of intelligent engineering by HP o simply the best by Hertz we never forget who made us number one we're Hertz we're America's wheels and by mr. Goodrich and your participating GM dealers keeping quality on the road so the Huskies will have it again as the defense's continue to dominate Hobart will throw it on first down here's this idea a 240 pound senior and he will pick up about 8 yards as Erik Anderson makes the sucker you see Hutchinson running by in the picture there that is Chris Hutchinson the junior out of Houston Texas who's had a number of injuries and it's slowed him down but at least he's getting to play in this Rose Bowl game in the back penalty flag we have an illegal procedure illegal movement offensive line fiveyard penalty Jack arute book Keith a lot of talk early in the week as you said about Steve Edmond his condition he came down with the flu a very serious case of it they put him in the hospital as you said they pumped fluids in him I talked with dr. Steve Bramwell was the chief physician for the Washington Huskies and he said he's almost actually 90% today I said well is that enough to places listen I've played in a Rose Bowl you can get that extra 5% real easy have to rest not the nor for it second down and seven now for the Huskies wanted to go deep with it he got away from Otis Williams to get the first down Obert looked deep because that's where he met Mario Bailey going but that's the way a good quarterback does it as you take a look at the weather today a great day really quarterback wants to look deep first to see if he can throw long and if he can't he comes back to his outlets which of all short receivers loses the ball in Zev Eric Anderson and that's probably kind of like trying to brush your teeth in a 12 foot vote on a nine foot wave you ain't gonna hold it offenders we got ahold Anderson knows better look he's just dropping straight back Washington has won a lot of wide receivers Lance a lot of foot crossing routes he was in a zone he dropped back and looked to the outside Anderson won the award diplomatic of the outstanding linebacker in the country second down and ten from the 40 right in between guests bard and Mackay and got booked on the seat of his breeches bike reception soon well the jokes going against the defense that is really more susceptible to the pass and they are the one here you take a look at the run defense and they did turnover margin but their fifth in the league and going against the pass that defense has improved at great deals at them throughout the year 50 seconds to go in the first turns makes it go beat secured Jennsen is going to come and run a hook in the middle and Bailey is going to swing outside and down the sideline a little change of routes the man in the top left of your screen reads it pretty well sees him back there but doesn't think he can get the ball big play for Michigan Baily is 5/7 number 28 keep the defensive back that was back there Michigan plays a lot of defensive backs he is like their seventh or eighth defensive act it's in the ball game Boyd Cora has confidence in all those guys Otis Williams a strong safety came in on that last play penetrated and made the tackle on Bryant behind literally in the line of scrimmage is falling forward was good for a yard Peter Pan verges behind the often to where it will be third down and goal for the Huskies as we've done back for the second quarter as we come back for the second quarter of play let me turn quickly to Bo Schembechler and coach see what you think of the ball game to this point well as you said Keith the defenses have dominated till late in that first period the big pass to Bailey really is the the entire first quarter offense I think both teams are going to have to establish some sort of a running game and try to pass short a little bit more rather than going to the key control time it is now third down and goal they're calling up the two Turner is in the backfield with Brian keeping it in that's one of the values 230 pound quarterback the I back watch the fake here that takes out Eric Anderson the Butkus Award winner and then he just scoops around finds a crack and gets in for the touchdown and somebody had a heck of a block on Buster Stanley here's Travis handsome for the and it just hopefully top it just got over ah get that thing over there Oh me it'll count everybody ever said how just get it the value of having a quarterback as your holder huh the bad snap and Hansen delays his kick long enough to allow him to get the ball up there wasn't tip two deflected he just didn't kick it very hard because he delayed his leg room but valium dude hit the ball up there's a look at the drive nine seconds 50 plays 54 yards on 8th place Desmond Howard 21 Tyrone weak to number 6 back Jason Kraft will kick it off for the Huskies and he shaped that when I mean he popped it straight up the sidelines a chance to kahin wait his hand for a fare did he waive his answer question I didn't couldn't tell with a crowd all around and you can fair catch a kickoff didn't give him enough room to have to make the catch you got to have room you got to give him two feet we got in a fare in New York with opportunity to make a fast edge 15yard penalty now I did blow this when the Huskies face then originally they're doing this video pooch kick off to get it away from Desmond but this ball didn't go far enough and 9:34 signaled for a fair catch but Hall number 5 came down and interferes with him well the rule says two yards four he's got give him two yards an opportunity to catch the ball I don't think James did that with the intention of going down there and himself catching and I think they just wanted to pooch it oh and keep it away from Desmond Howard I don't think they wanted it that I'm pretty sure they were looking for a 20 yard 20 yard kick Jesse Johnson is down in the backfield for Michigan as the Wolverines start on the Washington side of the field at the 44 yard line jonathan is number 30 over there Hey with a big play and there's a penalty flag back upfield but it's against Washington now watch this he's going to run it out and up Paul doesn't fight on the out Hall is deep he's in great shape the ball is underthrown now Desmond Howard comes and takes the ball away from him how many times have we seen that this year where the ball is up for grabs and Howard just goes and makes the play he wants it more than other feeders out jumps he's only 5 11 to paly off jumps he had a defensive face man in Carolina but Billy is deprived and so it is first and goal for the Michigan Wolverines at the Washington nine year get is number 40 Johnson is number three get back there I'm not sure they weren't moving around Johnson carries the ball and at 14:30 to go in the first half let's pause five seconds for our ABC stations to tell you who they are you're watching WSB TV channel to Atlanta Joe Hobart taking it ends in two yards now Michigan is threatening on second down and goal of Ricky powers the single bank for the Wolverine nations today Grbac pitches at the Howard fifteen Tommy Smith the strong safety or over James hovering in to make the play Michigan has two tight ends out here one to pull back they both brought down powers that's another tackle for a loss that's fourth four tackles for losses already in a little bit more than a quarter for Washington they mark him at the nine making third down and go and Michigan spends a timeout stopping the clock at 1314 to go in the first half and Michigan trying to tie it up in this series take a look at this graphic Michigan started on the Washington side of the 50yard line heretofore on the thirteen opponents drives that have started inside of Washington sterically have accounted for only two touchdowns and here's what Michigan has done inside the 20 here's my food to go to Desmond hi here's something new right here you got Yale Van Dyne lining up at tailback he's a wide receiver now they put it in motion Grbac with protection it Smith that's what grammatical do to you when he has time look at him he looks to the right the whole time look at him he's looking for Howard now he comes back the other way this is okay if I can't do it to Howard off door to a Smith outside technique by the quarter allows him to roam this land he's got enough inside but the Joe is over the inside linebackers in a great play and a chance to tie with John Dennis Carlton take a look at the bottom of your screen right here here he is here's the man is going to catch the ball he could run a slant in here but Howard is the man up here they're both running Slams Grbac is going to look to Howard first and then finally when he can't get the ball into Desmond will he come back and do his left along traffic in there he'd be pretty nicely there's a look at at Howard its fields under three helping out with Hall the linebacker they've got him triangle he would have had to fill the ball over Hoffman decided instead he goes the other way throws it over the linebackers looking at that a second time I'm going to suggest to you that number 34 the man who had gone in motion was probably the intended receiver he went through his hands and Walter Smith fought at the back of the end zone that's a possibility but you'll never get the quarterback to tell you I would all right Michigan having sighted at 7:00 we'll kick it off 13:09 to go in the first half on and the young man's in Colorado is accursed the 30s at the 32 and coming up after the Rose Bowl game we've got Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and the fighting Gators of Sharada and theirs are gonna be a lot of fighting going on in the u.s. F&amp;G Sugar Bowl that comes right after the Rose Bowl al michaels Dan Dierdorf and Frank Gifford and 400 to the faithful or hang their marks el macho's Dan Dierdorf from Frank Gifford in for TV the faithful Mark Brunell is in that quarterback for the Washington Huskies he's the man who led him to a win here a year ago against the Iowa Hawkeye so the lefthander who suffered a brutal knee injury last spring fights his way back to Ken he's in the lineup very at the 33 out to about the 36 from 7 and this is Alyssa's plan with Brunel coming in in the second quarter Don James told me a couple days ago what we'll go with through now give him a series in the second quarter just like we did Hobart last year when Brunel was playing in fact Brunel was the Rose Bowl MVP of the game last year mark is from Santa Maria which is a san luis obispo beyond Santa Barbara area sets up the throne the catch and Michigan came away with it but no big deal the ball was down here's Jack Keith you would think after scoring that touchdown that coach Gary Moeller would be happy well he's not he chided his entire offensive curry said we had to use a timeout because I called the play on the sidelines and you did not realize it when they got to the line you saw the plan on he's very concerned about the players being tight slapping each other being very upset about things as you've got to calm down hey Barry on the back for you now go back Michigan 35 he got away from Steve Morrison Aaron Pierce is right here there's a man lined up outside of him but he's just going to go down and break to the outside three backs to the wide side of the field Brunell drops back reached the coverage very well and hits his tiedin coming to the outside this is a good tight end Keith it is not surprising he's very much involved in the offense he's made three catches for 45 yards already the key thing there was he was the man that was covered by a linebacker and that spin is worth three yards there he is again Oh number 37 arrogantly Mark Brunell told that knee up in the spring it was a spring scrimmage he was happened to Mac Donald Jones the defensive end fella he recovered made a miraculous recovery missed two or three games at the start of this season and then has been the backup for Billy Joe Hobart the rest of the year on second down we're now back on the screen and to tackle this may fire in Stockton number 22 so he's going to be looking at third down and what goes to five no Keith I like this taking your quarterback out and putting in another one left it tells the starter Hobart who is on the sidelines hey let me sit down and watch let me just calm down you were talking about Jagger was talking about polar getting his troops to calm down this is a way for James you can do here's the pint in making the catch in traffic but Brunel put it in such a plate she couldn't hard to stop it why between the eight and four and we'll see about the penalty here edie cunningham the washington center is up there it's got a whole call to get the Michigan the Husky is going to have their first down whether the penalty will give them more yardage if that's the case they'll take that if not they'll take to play one of the thing that that Gary Moeller wanted to do defensively was get jams on these receivers jamming with the line of scrimmage coming off the line of scrimmage at that time he just got called for a hold the attend yard chair Lehrer previous spot automatic first time if you get the 10 yard penalty from the previous spot instead of the ball being at the 24yard line it's going to move on down just inside the 20 so it's first down in 10 score is tied 77 you got 10 15 to play in the first path Washington Huskies in the white against the Michigan Wolverine another 22 gets down to the 15 very impressive drive engineered by Mark Brunell you've got to be impressed missed a lot of the training camp in August and September came back and throwing very well he accounted for 25 touchdowns last year did Brunell 14 through the air he ran for 10 and he caught one so he led this team in scoring as a quarterback he laid his Stevie blue oh man the gourds of next three number will we get my job back this is Barry the holding came on the left side of the line so they lose the cuffs down well the first thing a coach wants to do when that happens is find out with one of the officials who was it on that's why they cut down all the sycamore trees around Brunell sets up the screen for feet Wolverines run it down pretty well snap of the ball was back outside then 21 and he'll get about four or five yards on the play at the conclusion of the game today would pick the Chevrolet most valuable player from each of these teams and for the 21st year through the Chevrolet scholarship program thousand dollars donated to the general scholarship fund of each school all right Jay berry is back in now the Huskies on third down and eight got the pedal another penalty flag on the beer holding defense goes the other way this time now mold can get upset one of the things that that Washington likes to do is spread you out defensively two wide receivers over here one over here and one in the backfield the receiver that's going to get the ball just going to go down break to the outside and the defensive back at the bottom of your screen being all spread out one on one will slip at the last minute and Brunel has the ball on target on time Mark Brunell in this possession as a quarterback is six for six 51 yard day Barry Oh Garrett Anderson for this graphic right here is updated to that Washington touchdown once everybody goes down the last 24 hours they came in not allowing one in twenty three quarters a nice play there by Brian Townsend to turn that play back in where the linebackers and defensive line can take the play now you get defensive changes and it looks like they will go to a nickel structure here fat me and he to make the play wasa to on the play well he looked to pop the ball right out to the outside but that didn't work yeah they took they took good riot away from I'm not so sure I'm not so sure this wasn't the design there was a design quarterback look at the alignment going downfield it was a fake it just didn't work we told you Brunelli it was a very good runner last year yeah we didn't have a bad knee oh they're back on the seventh gets it off into the endzone the Husky kicking team will come here so the reason this play doesn't work Keith and one of the strategies by Michigan they want to jam these receivers watch these 3d bees Jam the three wide receivers as they're trying to get off the line of scrimmage look at him none of them gets off cleanly that's what took his timing off initially by the time McKay broke free there were so many of those big old linemen in his face couldn't see him messed up the timing on so Travis Henson is in now for a 24 yard field goal try Georgeson will hold it and the man who snaps it is Bruce Bailey a junior yeah they came over and said something to the Wolverine side of the fields and moved back was supposed to be back in that retaining area guys you're creeping up on the edge of the field you're subject to penalty but most of the time they're gonna move you back be friendly about it unless you abused it then they'll get more see I don't see what difference takes are all down at one end of the field anyway I'm laughing a good boat just jumped out of his chair I mean that Fisher was looking in the wrong direction if he's fighting those guys out on the field over here 650 to play in the first half by a margin of 3 1978 the Washington Huskies and the Michigan Wolverines had at it here in the Rose Bowl Warren Moon this 28 yard pass to Spyder game let the Huskies out to a 24 nothing lead then they hung on to win 27 to 20 now as we get ready for the kickoff following the field goal let's turn to Bo Schembechler one more time and get reflections on the game I thought that was a great Drive by Washington by Mark Brunell in the short passing game King took him down there to score lost the touchdown on the penalty then Michigan did a great job I thought defensively enforcing the field goals I think Michigan has to move the football on this Drive they haven't done it yet and they haven't blown football well and I think they've got to do it now kicking busy last time he tried it the pooch ticket he pumped it straight up the elevator shaft Desmond Howard and Tyrone Wheatley they're standing on the 15yard line how that's not very respectful is it Henson had a bad back Travis answered earlier in the season I think that's why they don't but this time crabhammer a freshman number 25 and Lamar's got something to talk about the rest of his life Howard tries to go bit of a crease but just doesn't make it in time too much team speed by the Huskies and so the Wolverines will go to work from the 13 yard line you put Wheatley in the backfield little again they are gathered into a tight little group aren't they another tackle behind the line of scrimmage Tommy Smith number 15 was the man who came from the outside got into the backfield and disrupted everything was pleased strong safety strong safety blitz the Huskies have not allowed more than one touchdown in a quarter all year long Michigan has already scored in this quarter this is a very aggressive defense that's called a fifth tackle for a loss by the walk six man through there and he'll get it up to about the 17 yard line before Dave Huffman and his friends make the tackle Wheatly is is a key person in this whole structure of things because he is the one guy if he gets you past that linebacker who can go all the way and he really run michigan plays three different tailbacks and Wheatley who is a true freshman has the most speed and he may be out outlaw him if they gonna freak Cass was thrown a little and Wheatley didn't catch it you would lay that fall behind again Stuka timing was a little messed up so Elvis had to throw it a little bit harder and Wheatley just didn't hang on to him tough day so far for Elvis Grbac and so Michigan now will punt it and Washington should come out of this with pretty good field position at 5:23 to go in the first half the problem with Michigan keifa's beau has said is they they have to run the football they have not got a running game going yet we got a new punter he's back in population but if there is to be any deception on it they've messed it up because they were too obvious about everything hay floats have been moved now into storage area and some of those areas are down here by the Rose Bowl that they will be moved into secure areas as the day goes on on that last play you had Eric Anderson lined up as one of the blocking backs with Wheatley into the game it's a kind of a thing that has to be done quickly and Anderson on three different occasions that we know of has run the ball for a first down out of the putt formation but it has to be done quickly and you do it if the defense is set up correctly for it obviously Michigan has seen something and they're on the punt rush of the Huskies well you got ten Huskies up on the line right now their ears laid back too dangerous to do it inside doesn't get much on it when he dropped that ball the ball back point hit Imani a the mayor often crooked the Michigan punting has been awful it's only 29 yards on that watch this drop if you can see it how you drop that ball the back point gonna come down and hit him on the egg now you can't see it from there Michigan is used just take a look at this you're not gonna get anything I'm better that's almost sideways yeah Michigan has used two different putters here Stapleton and s Kona Billy Joe Hobart is back in quarterback for Washington they start at the Michigan 46 yard line Jarius income Darius Turner his fullback first time they've tried to go to him today well I don't know but what Darius Turner might not have had himself pretty goodsized play if he that ball yes he did Turner was a starter lot last year came in and had some problems injury problems really is nothing to seen a lot of action this year but it had a chance to make secure Washington ten Michigan seven closing we'll see all of these wide receivers take an extra degree of punishment today when they try to catch the ball Muriel Bailey is right here as well come down run a square in and Browne is right here looking for it Muriel Bailey is the man that has numbers very similar to what Desmond Howard has there you see the hit this is veno Bryant nothing doing with that one Bailey's catch of course good for a first down to the Michigan 29 that plays good for a couple of yards four and a half minutes to go in the first half it rained hard on Monday and Tuesday here in Los Angeles Sunday Monday and Tuesday started to clear up and today is very pretty yesterday was sunnier than it is today where's Mario Bailey you know Howard at the bottom Heisman Trophy Bailey B team in receptions and yards the neutral zone the fascists gone on about come quick and you had Eric Anderson I think court no new crowbar yep trying to anticipate last possession about a defensive team 5yard penalty and last possession you had Mark Brunell who is a totally different cadence than village Oh Hobart so it makes it difficult on people who are trying to anticipate half time you'll have both bands highlight some stats so have your local news that's the country take it down three and run tackling good blocking up front 70 is Mala Mala cunningham 79 big haul up front this man runs a 40 and 4.3 seconds to track he's a track guy tough guy to five 100yard games this year again there's a little well there are some hitting going on down there we're number eight for Michigan and they know it well you know you talk about track people there are football players who run track and track people who try to play football and Beno Bryant is a football player who runs track and so ago Lendl McKay Pete O'Brien has seven career touchdowns of 50 yards has had four punt returns we got him out in the flanker spot right now overlooks looks at him my goodness what are you gonna do I mean he put it right on his hands count your fingers Beno are they all there take a look at the protection Hobart looks to his right the entire way he finally clears some linebackers well you can't put it any better than that that's the third drop by husky receiver it's third down and six all third and goal from the 6 of collect kicking genome in was a nice play by Wallace he comes in in passing situations the ball is underthrown actually hoping through the ball late if he would have thrown the ball sooner there was a lot of area to for the receiver to run to in the corner Hansen has a 24 yarder today this is 23 yards out of Eric jordison hole Bailey snapping he's that too bad snap this one 3:29 to go it's now 13 7 that lucky boy the attendance will be around the hundred thousandplus mark I'm sure the tickets have been a scarce for this one because this is an effective measure so far it is the defensive teams that have really stood up the things that stand out Michigan has not established a running game and Elvis Grbac has not been able to get anything going through the air Washington has lost two touchdowns one on the hoping play and then one of the drop pass by bean O'Brien on this last Drive this is the now we're told that son Dodger as we had has been retired and this is kingly doubt I think he's tribal eyes we are deep of the he gets away from one it comes on back up to about 220 yard line but again the Huskies have got contact with Desmond Howard on the kickoff return after 11 yards that's pretty good if you can get your hands on him and slow him down after 10 11 12 yards after he takes the kick that's pretty good getting a little bit of a foothold in this ball game now Michigan on the other hand total yards Andrusha they've got one yard rushing and 44 yards through the air personal foul call is against Michigan so Howard had him out to the 20 but now the penalty takes him back Aries signaling in the play with Gary said he wanted to run the football they're tough to run he said we still need one Washington defense nobody has run on this team give it a job to me they like those from the 10 to the 17 Michigan continues to rotate their tailbacks Johnson now in their powers has been in there some Wheatley was in there some trying to find somebody that's going to get some yardage Deebo tied in shifting over Johnson Johnson gives it off here goes back to Howard on that side they were going back and forth I was getting dizzy you talk about a double reverse but when you see a reverse a lot of people's hands of double Reapers really not it's just a reverse this was a double reverse it started one way went the other way and then came back 34 yard line their backs pass on the throne East Carolina beat the Wolfpack today in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta bill Lewis what a job he's done yep yep he's in the rumor mill for the Georgia Tech job Syracuse beat Ohio State by 7 and California bounced Clemson pretty good 37 to 13 and the Citrus Bowl seen here on ABC Sports Florida State beat Texas A&amp;M 10 to 2 and that is the score never expect Smith has that thing right on his hands it's lost all of its momentum and he doesn't make the catch but it's another screen on third down passing situation second now excuse me but the screen is all messed up it's messed up because of the defensive lineman twisting and turning up in front of them the ball is deflected in Smith could have had a big interception third down and 10 for the Wolverines from the 30 for 13 to 7 Washington leads to of a half minutes to go in the birthday as I get numbers for man who came in leading the nation in passing efficiency that is their last time out January 11 on ABC Sports national crowns and Olympic births on the line US Figure Skating Championships presented by diet coke and NutraSweet first on the season premiere of ABC's Wide World of Sports top male skaters competing for

Tonya Harding and world medallist Nancy Kerrigan Saturday January 11 here on ABC Sports here's Jack arute rookie that was the president the tournament of the committee Bob Cheney and Bob you have a brandnew very special guest that's with us this weekend Jack a very special guest yes sir we've had this gentleman in town to the parade in the game and I got to tell you I have I have two grand marshals I have one coin both grand marshal said let's solve the problem that's justice to Scipio who is a former hostage from Lebanon and Joseph you said when you were held hostage you had one dream and that was to come to the Rose Bowl and that was a 1986 and so here it is in 1992 and my dream has finally come true Keith let me ask him quickly how do you feel today I feel I can't tell you how I feel it's so marvelous everything is unreal like fantasy gleams of either that's part of the Rose Bowl tradition key now a third down by Jesse Johnson drop passes today for Gary Moeller and Elvis peacock I mean Elvis Grbac ball is right there and nobody gets a decocker router somewhere that's a little better all the way back from the backside he's tracked down by the number eight but that was a 54yard punt by a schooner just when the coach is ready to send him home on or an empty railroad car he delivers a 54 yarder great hits by where B no didn't see him coming at all but he still gave Washington pretty good field position the Huskies now they're 213 in play our seniors have all three of their timeouts remaining and they start from the 22nd for Burton on first down the pass to Aaron Pierce too tight in that's out to the 30 to the 6 yard pickup area kind of a overcast sort of a day but very very pleasant temperature expecting to get to maybe the low 70s before it starts to cool off it's just almost I feel playing conditions for routine for the first town his way to the 41 yard line just nickelanddime stuff but if he got the time short passing the linebackers of michigan getting deep drops pierced the tight end has caught four balls that one going to the back bennett and 59 to go in the first half 13 to 7 washington lead and slides down that's the first instance I think well we have seen somebody run into some residual trouble from the rain a little slicking at once but as the day goes on and as you get down toward dark Michigan blitzing and over it not bumps it up let it go intersect put the ball just inside the 30yard line 436 left inside linebacker Steve Morrison drops back into zone coverage sees the play goes up to make the tackle and says hey wait a minute it's a Christmas gift New Year's Eve in here that's his fourth interception of the year for Steve Morrison Bob Todd berry our spotter says that Michigan had 12 men on the field on that last pass foot and got away with then we go back and check but certainly Gary's not going to be talking about it if everybody going to be spoken about it there'd be Don James a man was not involved in the play I should say that but he was still on the beat I only see one into the crowd they're still they Washington 29 no cliche folks but that's the horse but he is relentless Keith he is just like a raging Boy from the 41 his third down and 22 Michigan came into this game with only six sacks by their quarterback on the other hand the Huskies at sack quarterbacks 48 times first in last year's game Tommy Smith Hey that the Michigan DC Washington defenses tackled Michigan behind the line of scrimmage eight times already here in the first half and the clock shows 23 seconds to play in the first half Sherpa Bowl comes up right after the Rose Bowl featuring in the u.s. FNG Sugar Bowl in New Orleans the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame in the fighting Gators of Florida I think two of the really sharp minds in college football Lou Holtz and Steve Spurrier squaring off in that one Shane Matthews is supposed to be back from knee surgery and I guess Lou's going to be doing the coordinating the deep defense if I were on the Florida side I'd be worried about that I don't know who's always been an offensive guy he's a feisty little he'll get you going he will rattle the the roof a little DeWitt pokes up here's another man it's not terribly big in stature but they no doubt about who's the boss Don dance he's had 14 Bowl teams during his time at the Washington 110 this is his fifth appearance in the Rose Bowl and the other four that he's been in he's three and one all packed in coaches and the winningest of all time in the pac10 on fourth down and 25 now as Kona is in the game and the Huskies at this point 20 off seconds to go why not try so if you got something up your sleeve because three yard line and let the clock run out and go to the clubhouse leading by six points take disappointment for Michigan you start on the Washington 30yard line or thereabouts and you end up punting the ball you almost want to go ahead and go for it throw it deep down and there see what you can get for it but the defense has been playing pretty well so it on the figures here that the Huskies will go forward a snap and hope it will put a knee down and the only thing wrong with the circumstances they have to run the length of the field to get to the clubhouse and that's what it's going to be at 13 to 7 at halftime well it didn't exactly put his leader underneath but the half is over so sixpoint lead 13 to 7 for Washington over Michigan and wood after this message that the word from our ABC station well there have been instances in this postseason where the defensive people have stood up on other occasions and shut down most of the the highpowered offense II works and we've got one of those things building right here knowing well it's amazing that that's dominant has Washington has been the game is as close as it is Michigan defensively has not done anything they have not been able to establish any kind of a running game elvis grbac works best with that running game i think they need to get him outside the pocket in talking with Jim Lambright the defensive coordinator for Washington he says he doesn't move his feet well he's slow they don't get him outside the pocket we're going to try it try and crash the pocket they need to get him outside to give him some time but if he doesn't have the quick movement against this defense can he survive moving around so quick or do something like that they've grown some balls deep for Desmond he has caught some balls but he really has not been open the thing they need to do is establish your running to do you know can they do I understand what establish your run but when you every time you stick your head in there you look like you're in a sausage factory so yeah what are you gonna do about it well that's that's the problem that is the basic problem this team is so quickly the overriding difference in these two teams is the team speed Michigan has some speed but they don't have the team speed that Washington has they are a big physical power and knock them down smashmouth type of team and Washington is just the opposite and the speed now is winning Desmond Howard did give them the one big play but otherwise they have contained him pretty well as you take a look at the first half possessions for the Michigan Wolverines and I think you'll get some feeling about how futile it's been for look at it and that one touchdown it was a result of Desmond Howard coming back around in front of all and just picking his pocket when the only time they did score they got great field position inside the positive field position on Washington's 44 yard line the pass was caught by an unexpected receiver Walter Smith that wasn't it so now here Michigan sits on the own the horns of a dilemma do we do we go to a different offensive setting that they made offensive changes coming into this ballgame because of the Washington defense well you don't do anything slow developing in the backfield they threw all those out they want to get to the line quickly but they're still are not getting positive place they're still getting big negative plays on first and second down okay Robert we'll talk with Bush him back in a few minutes but right now we want to join bill vessel on the University of Washington husky Dan such the music here is fantasizing now starring the husky band Ezeiza phones this is Scott gullet the Entertainer we're at halftime at the 78 playing the Rose Bowl game at Washington leading Michigan 13 to 7 back with coach Bo Schembechler in a moment cradled between mountains and sea the city of Seattle is home to the University of Washington the

Great Northwest the Rose Bowl brought to you by Hyundai maker a fine quality automobiles test drive a Honda at your local dealer today and by UPS offering 10:30 a.m. guaranteed overnight air delivered ready to go it was defense in the first half and you can see that I think in looking at sure doc just having an awful day in the first half against the very tough defense Hobart you see those numbers it was not there where is the other quarterback for Washington like you know who did take him down was six out of seven for 51 yards and a little extra seems to be hanging in every tackle that is made today Brett Collins got most of that one on Desmond solar they'll start out with pretty much the same alignment we had in the first half of play for Michigan ger back at quarterback they used all three of their tailbacks powers Johnson and Wheatley Leggett most of the time back he's there and so his powers to start the second half the top of the picture Ricky powers and he'll pick up from the tree three up to the 26th and de maison making the tackle the offensive leaders for Michigan in the first half yeah they can't be too pretty a Michigan didn't do a lot so we talked about Elvis and his passing Howard one rushing play for 15 yards as the leading rusher and he and he caught one pass to Desmond Howard for 35 yards would set up their touchdown Washington defensive leaders was led by Fraley hetman with one vii they had seven tackles for losses behind three yards by a quarterback coming up to support at the boundary that makes eight tackles behind the line of scrimmage they come into the game averaging 14 tackles behind the last gym this is what's so tough you lose yardage on these guys just starting the second half it is third and nine Jones just missed intros powers who made the reception out of the backfield and I think what we're seeing here is if Michigan does not have a sophisticated passing attack in that without a running game Michigan's passing attack is not that very good that's good good as Kona is in the punt on say something nobody has made Michigan looked like this all year not even get on the strip they have the same speed kick is away the low line drive that's taken by Bryant got a little daylight needs a block on the 39 for the Washington Huskies as Kony got over there and help down on the target on the 34yard fun and a 20yard return he is going to get a block from the other side take a look at from the reverse angle Williams is number 17 he gets inside of him there's a host of the Wolverines but the Conner comes up and makes nice hit at 39 Hawaii look at that over the bench at 39 on the kicking team incidentally is Chico Fraley changes his shoot J berries in the back for you at tailback Michigan defensively their leaders Williams a strong safety with six tackles and an interception now possession wise for Washington a lot of possession not many plays and some of them but a lot of different possessions over passes away to Bailey was absolutely gotten completely free from where and was gone and Hobart missed him by five year that was an allout blitz by defensive the defense was sending six guys very unusual see how the number eight where gets way to the inside to take away the inside the field why as a quarterback when you see them blitz and you have time and you got a man this wide open and you miss them you just do you never get it that good third down and nine okay if the man three yards not a good series for over the first possession of the second half Keith Michigan comes out and shows an allout blitz on second down oceans if they're going to get after a little bit more trying to make something happen we're Dell the Punit and Howard to receive it so far they kicked it to it as long as Michigan keeps it close they always have Howard that can create something that makes something happen very quick one flashing moment this whole thing out of bounds didn't make it that artistic feasts of kicking work by john merdell as he kills it down in a coffin corner you can see pac10 teams have had pretty good success over the last decade right now Michigan will have the ball at the 8th the ball is placed at the 8th because that's where it hit one of the Washington players covering the kick three thieves in the Oh swing pass after Hockman is out there 50 he missed him but not until Weekly has covered some real estate up to the 28 yard line and here's dr. region well Keith in the locker room specifically Kary Mullis Michigan locker room he again tried to reemphasize that his team has to calm down he feels Elvis Grbac as somewhat rattled by the pass rush he told him they've got to think about it conversely Oh Don James needs to convert he says on the big plays also Shane Falco a has an injured shoulder he's if he begin and he'll be out pitch back to Wheatley again he's got a big gain out across the 45 yard line and another Michigan first down what they decided to do is run wide was Wheatley here pitch it to him spread them out a little bit and then used his quickness and speed to offset the speed of the Huskies and he is a burner at play work because they were not coming across as aggressively Donnelly wouldn't be that good each play for Michigan now they've got six up and down Senate the first man to hit him is Donald Jones and then Tyrone Rodgers penn state has moved out to a four point lead over tennessee in their bowl game it's second down and ten for Michigan going back to the masses in weight tool again both teams have the dropsies don't they well again is not one of their top receivers they're trying to do something different by bullshitting powered away and then throwing to their fullback Leggett he only caught five passes all year coming into the ballgame he's not one of their top men but trying to change it up a little bit Michigan has two big play people on the field Keith and that's of course Desmond Howard but Wheatley the tailback has we're at least bigplay player it was Howard here he's going to go down in 1a now now let's run this thing we'll show you how to get double coverage ointment the back Nicole there is going to run deep now let's own curb now if you'll stop it right here you'll see the line back stop right there also drops back to cover short and that's why the ball was overthrown as Kona's ate but of the day first easy this time on this side of the meal what to give me heartburn we have the defensive team violate the nutribullet by your killers so the Huskies make a mistake and lose this opportunity but it is not a first down for Michigan it'll be fourth and five and I think that's bad timing keep your you backed up by inside your own 45 yard I don't think this is the time to do it 10 yards it may be when you're less of course are going expecting it but Anderson where's number 37 because he was a fullback in college I mean in high school but when he got to college they moved him to linebacker things that they've been looking for that play all day and they decided not to check it off to let it go and run it they were just fortunate that the defense was holding so now they'll fun it I think and you put it this way OB versus those those plays and they just gave him the five yards back those plays are good if they work I mean if they don't work you look silly when you trying the lair game operation thing Bryan chase it down the kick dicta sideways back and goes gotta pass up on the 25yard line but again you have got a penalty flag thrown across the side and again it could be a Washington offside here so they're they're both the defensive team offside didn't like their played in a bucket a quick man let me tell you about the officials from the Southeastern Conference Jimmy Harper is that is the man in the white hat lines up in this village for Joe Delaney jr. the field judge back judge is Charlie Horton umpire is Nate Anderson the line judge is Tommy Laurie no member here were running back War Eagle side judges John Guare knee and the alternates Mac gentry so we ran out to grass on that one a little strip of fiveyard during the middle of the field going back and forth all to North everybody put the hands in the pocket kick thing get it out of there Andy Mason had some penetration kick be no Brian here in the second half for the first time at their own 20 Washington takes hold first the Goodyear blimp Columbia out of Carson California the pilots Charles Russell these can resolve Oh Beach the cameraman is Glenn Hampton hey Charlie don't you have to look where you're going when Hampton growing that prolific beard he gets a little whiter we're gonna get you a red suit here go the Huskies to the attack now with Beto Brian from the 20th to the 26th picked up to six yards on the play it'll be second down and four the huskies are sitting on a 13 to 7 lead with nine and a half minutes to go in the third quarter now they put two wideouts at the bottom of the picture handed off and Bryant runs into some big people wearing maison bleue and stops rather abruptly as 92 takes him down that would be Mike Evans the senior from Roxbury Massachusetts Wolverine defense is pretty tough coming out after a halftime they're probably going to need to paint the walls in both Locker makes it keeps it wasn't nice got the pierced the tightass pretty goodlooking to play that very good very goodlooking playing this is the way it was designed here's the tidy and he's going to come off the line of scrimmage it is the fake is made out here watch the linebackers win the ball and the strong safety they're all gonna bite on it and when the fake is made the linebackers come up Titan gets behind him in an open area welldesigned player first down fortyeight give me Hartford golf's time here but I'm not the chain how you guys get enough to change well at the 49 guests Park Paris the USF Angie makes it another first down for the and it's at the Michigan 36 first down passing the best time to throw big offensive line gives him lots of time kitchen cats gas cards a number three wide receiver for the Huskies and please lose all all three of their top receivers next year they know Brian is in no man there's village'll handed it off an amble donut there and all of a sudden there was nothing but dark blue around him and Buster Stanley got most of him to take him down for no gain second down and ten coming up Darius Turner checks back in as Mark Bruner goes off for the Huskies that's the name you might tuck away you'll hear it all up next year freshman tied in over for the and Turner is down to about the thirty where he is thinking better now water well let me show you Keith what they're doing with their dropping back in zones these four guys these linebackers are all gonna drop back into zones right about in here and what Michigan is going to do is just get somebody underneath them dump them the ball watch how deep they get the inside the linebackers get well deep and then see you have ten yards between them when the receiver by the time he gets the ball third and four in 25 before Evanston stuffing I'm in a secondary concern so it looks both teams have come on doing what Moe said they should be doing and that's and your ears back and set in your jaw and and run the ball well it's the passing game though that's opening up another good run yeah and turn our routes in there for three second down and seven as we get a little hail to the victors music from the man forward so guilty to intercept it right into the arms of lance cotton and buttons cutting in front of Mario Bailey just didn't get Billy Joe's lucky to get that one back Bailey's just running a kind of a receiver that just went by was the man he really wanted to get the ball to Bailey number five is the kind of the outlet couldn't wait any longer put the liquid in you timid the ball is caught down in the corner and the Huskies have it inside the 5yard line he ducked that thing so short of the line of scrimmage it was close I think he was to Keith and this gives you the perspective of what a quarterback on the move can do Garba cannot throw on the run outside the pocket hobart can very Oh Bailey goes down moves around a little bit Brown had the coverage and moved back inside but in good shape inside the 5yard line pitch it back Anderson and the five and I mean taken down a great linebacker he is you know Defensive Player of the Year in the Big Ten pension the the Butkus Award leading the team in tackles all these years loss on that play of two yards to put it back at the five and it's second down and goal for the husky the coverage is there but a mobile quarterback gives you time for the receivers to to improvise and do something else Hoover a true freshman playing his first year of college football breaks back the same way the quarterback is running and then keeps his feet inbounds and they've got the look of going for two when they are at nineteen to seven they will oh boy his mobility yes five of 64 66 yard penetration forces able to get outside the park if this may have been designed because everybody is working that way look at this great play 1981 these two teams who went at it in the Rose Bowl and it was a big day for John Winkler and Anthony Carter and Bo Schembechler Bo's first win and the Rose Bowl as his Wolverines beat Washington 23 the six big drive there took it on their own 20yard line play took it down for a score and unsportsmanlike call moves the ball on a penalty on the kickoff up to the 50yard line for exactly what kick it off and Desmond Howard will wait for it down there with Wheatley that's the 5yard line coming here somebody reached and look like they might have goin time yep don't call it Wheatly with the best speed of the running backs he got his hand on there didn't he I didn't get off her record that slow motion but side of the hill hold on there for a while all right Michigan's ball but it's certainly no place to be terribly adventurous back on your own 5yard line trailing 21 to 7 with 521 to go in the third quarter got called and what Washington is lined up and the circumstances presenting itself and says I'm going becomes just poor planning right there that's to just you just don't waste touchdown so I'm in timeouts when you're behind let's go back to the previous Washington touchdown the back in motion is going to come out here the man he wants to throw it to is here he's going to go down and break to the outside now let's go ahead and run it and we'll show you that the initial play is covered everybody is covered now when Brunel starts back the other way a stop it right here watch the tight in here he's going to go back and work the other way as the quarterback works back the other way when the quarterback starts running the Tynan who is the freshman that's Bruner goes back the other way and he finds him in the back of the end zone to give you some idea of what's going on today and some perspective now there's this the story of Desmond Howard on 1991 104 yards he is caught one pass only one pass for 35 yards he's run run reverse for 15 yards and he's the kick returns and the punt guess you're curious about Mario with S on his chest four catches 76 yard we'll get to you on the play I'd get your clock rolling as we head inside five minutes I'm inclined I know that you sit here and watch a ballgame go like this Bob Griese an ambush effect I'm inclined to say the Washington defense is responsible for the Richer get off it's not going anywhere because the Michigan Opera is ain't gonna build that quick look at this is what you're seeing is the speed and the power infants got the power but they've got the speed to go with it Michigan needs to establish a running game take a look at that phone number 90 right in the middle of that offensive line that's Elliott just gets blown back by Edmund and then by the rest by that time when he recovers the rest of those guys are in there that's one of the best offensive linemen in America Matt Elliott and that big old guy right there just ran over and just man hands Michigan needs foundation of a running game Washington has taken the money Soph to the sideline man well you're throwing out of your own endzone now and the team has been sacking you and been right near you all the day all the time so this is not an easy place to throw from he just throws this ball higher joining it away from the defensive back but he's 415 and 67 yards as Kona gets a pretty good kick out of the end zone I've said to the 43 48 so he loses 5 in tried to return a 40yard punt at 338 to play in the third quarter the husky is leading 21 to 7 gets the ball back and after our ball game here in Pasadena we'll go off to New Orleans on the USF and G Sugar Bowl I think this will be a very entertaining matchup Lou Holtz and Steve Spurrier squaring off matching wits Nino Bryant is being helped with the bench and bad news for Washington number 42 is the junior out of northglenn Colorado behind berry now would be Napoleon Kaufman the Swift freshman from Lompoc one Seattle writer defined Kaufman's feet as looking like needles in a sewing machine when he runs second down and five is it Barry again and there this time 37 is on top but the big fella underneath the pile is number 65 Neal's ups Keith you mentioned that Sugar Bowl game with another Dame and we mentioned Shane Matthews is back the Rick Meyer puts him talk about him up maybe being his last ball game he is an outstanding young quarterback right ankle injury for be no blanket outside daya's senior from Seattle point just a quick hint she's just going to go down five or six steps and stop they're going to game the ball right now and then say hey do something with it that's just the thing that Michigan needs to be doing with Desmond Howard throw the ball out to him and let him use his running ability he is the most dangerous guy in the country Mario is not batting so this is Neptune Morrigan he takes it down for the rush again 25 24 to Washington now starting on certain kinds of plays are getting big chunks at its second down and two winding down called the end of the third quarter a minute and 40 seconds to go double tight and Kirsten Brunner Barry it's too long go McKay who is a member of a record holding relay team 511 180 and I me go by flyers here's Jack arute well Keith this is not good news for the Washington Huskies Beno Bryant is behind me right here and they are wrapping his severely sprained right ankle I talked to Steve Brammo he said actually what they think is he's out for the game is if the swelling goes down they'll drive in the fourth quarter exact thinks they got enough points anything defenses all they need down J berries slamming in there and the man with his arms around his legs is Erik Anderson number 37 you looking at fourth and one got half of what they needed and they're gonna go Henson is not coming gas card comes instead and so they'll go for the first down Oh yards and gets the first down at the 20 and stage now rolling against Tennessee big strong team they got better every week didn't they yes they did I like the future of Tony Succar too if that size and strength he brings in I think he's got some playing days I like his size and I like his arm strength Obert back comes one back pierced over there he's inside the tenyard another Washington first down the husband will have it first eight six catches 84 yards for big 84 watch him just get in between the two linebackers right there Morrison and Anderson Tainan just gets in between them the quarterback can shoot him if he wants to or throwing other places but Pierce is a good tight in all pac10 knows how to get open is it buried and you think it down to five for a free yard pick up second down and goal we run out of time on the third Washington leading 217 looking to get more we'll be back after this message after work from our ABC stations well Washington won here a year ago and so they're trying to match the feet of UCLA and Vera Donahue's team's winning in 83 and 84 they won yesterday down in El Paso couldn't believe that score in CLA in Illinois offenses six to three caught a window second down and goal for the Huskies give it a ferry he's at the three yard line a twoyard pickup Pierce is 84 Anderson 37 the top middle there he's gonna watch he gets blocked temporarily that's what makes him so good I mean other linebackers would be blocked and stay blocked but Anderson pops up and enough time to get over and make the tackle you know Keith he's 62 and 242 pounds I was thinking make a very good and we go the motion is here the playaction is here the quarterback is going to roll out this way and here's right here is going to go deep and sneak to the back of the endzone just come across playaction fake holds the linebackers now he starts rolling to buy some time the Pierce is a good receiver no it's not good he missed it they missed it 2017 to 70 there's your possession for Washington in their mantle Pearce reeled in an is7 catch 86 yards distant rebel kick it off well Washington Desmond Howard and Tyrone plays with become sideling up 29 yard line close to the 30 Bo Schembechler is sitting away from me here and I can't tell whether he was considering going down on the field or not but he looks absolutely disgruntled about things well I think we run into the number one team in the country and they're playing that way they are playing well there's no question about it but here Bo the game plan kind of goes to the board doesn't it can't play catchup now we've got past trap screen and draw and do the best job we can to scores often in this fascinating Michigan's longest sustained Drive in this ballgame today has been in dboy in front bullet finger Bock and he couldn't hold it his two Huskies hit it on the ball alive and the biggest piece of the tackle would go to that man Dave Hoffman though it's second down and 10 for Michigan trailing 27 to 7 on that one either the game by Jesse Johnson my captivate orders these stats miss Becky well first of all plays our second the top 71 plays for Washington to only 38 for Michigan total yards 331 for Washington only 94 passing yards for Michigan 67 rushing yards for Michigan only 27 and five first down little bit gets his pass I me feels really put a lick on Jessie Johnson detection is good for Elvis this time slides to his left doesn't throw real well on the run I me feel just come from out of nowhere like how's that you made it I don't think he made it I'm fourth in about a yard and a half I see is gonna think behind strepa neck and we haven't mentioned his name hardly at all today Keith great set the net debates 325 pounder who lines up on the left side they always they like to run short yardage behind him incidentally Infinite's crepin AK have not been head to head today they have not squared off as such he didn't make it but varmint 2700 acres and he said is it still in my always be in my body says when my playing days are over I'll go back and I'll live Mark Brunell comes out to quarterback this possession for Washington and they stick it in the end zone here you're served Miami you can be sure that the Hurricanes are looking at this one and knowing job is just to stay up with Washington who armed what the MVP of last year's world bowl game take a look at this one a demigod of yeah that's good it'll help from the ground on that one yeah and it's just like that 34 to 7 that probably is the lubricant Mario Bailey there in the middle who dis caught the touchdown passed the kickoff will drift back to the four yard Dearborn Heights and these out close to the 29 yard line take another look at it and it is marginal mr. whether or not he really had possession whether he catches this ball or whether he not is not going to make any difference in the outcome of this ball game which he did not catch it but what it's going to make a difference is the guys voting in the polls tomorrow morning if Miami wins tonight and there's the polls and there is the competition right there Baili now with 18 touchdown catches on the year Desmond Howard has 19 but to get back to my point if Washington really wins James Clifford makes it down we pause five seconds right here to allow our ABC stations to identify themselves you're watching WSB TV channel to Atlanta and daylight departing on yon horizon as we see the brightly lit Rose Bowl here in the horizon as we see the brightly lit Rose Bowl here in the Arroyo Seco Seco Pasadena California Grbac is 5 of 17 while game 72yard the back side gets it away fast and Tony McGee will pick up the first down for the Wolverines after the 44 yard line and as Clifford comes up humbly Clifford was a starter giving up dingedup lost his job but has been able to really get back in the lineup he's only a junior wait he missed last year with the knee injury Keith in fact in 89 two years ago he led the entire pac10 in tackles pretty good catch by Yale Van Dyne has tried him two or three times today but that's really the first time that he's been able to get his hands on it and he likes Pichette he's a tough little gun Hey absolutely there he's pretty goodsized 195pound named after Yale Larry he's playing because of the injury earlier the season for Derrick Alexander who will be back next year he's also a flyer without including Clifford who was humbling a minute people pull him out I'm remaining in this game coming up on eleven minutes at Washington in control the thing at 34 274 Michigan's not alone there were nine other teams in the pac10 a schedule of Washington that couldn't want to that gets it away just in time shave off the arm of Yale van now you're looking and a penalty on somebody Michigan motion Halil accept the penalty bring up third down been a great year for Garry bowler though the last two years really he's been 19th for he did something in two years of Michigan that Bo Schembechler couldn't do in 28 years at Michigan and that is bring a Heisman Trophy around ever bow bro both Desmond well I guess that's true Anderson touchdown blazing speed take a look at it man and coverage in the secondary the defensive backs are not looking at the line of scrimmage they're looking at the men they're covering and Wheatley with tremendous speed invention Desmond Howard and Wheatley were the two game breakers on that offense JD Carlson's in for the tribe and it's good and the first 26 plays of this ballgame rushing Michigan at the 35yard all that one play they get 53 the Goodyear blimp comes from Carson California and they call her Columbia and Charles Russell is flying it morning Glenn Hempton the vivid pictures and it's quite a second onside kick coming up good Malcolm good mount to the air Washington got it good kick though huh yeah was really good had a chance that's all you can ask for and a 34 to 14 ball game with 1030 threes to play has to go 10 yards before Michigan can touch it but it doesn't have to go 10 before Washington now since it's been touched all bets are off Washington went up and touched it within 10 yards has stained a hole they've got two number Five's on see through a bunch yeah they hold a record two at the Rose Bowl record for the only been one time the two number Five's on the same team in the same Rose Bowl game two scored a touchdown both of them did that last year so the Huskies go to work now if the pullian Kaufman at tailback and they take the first snap from the 44 yard line and speaking of Washington football here's Jack with more well Keith from the day and age when people talk about recessions and budget cutbacks would you be surprised to find out that over all the athletic budget at the University of Washington showed a net profit of over 5.3 million dollars last year the major reason according to sources there the success of their football team the football team netted a profit of over 10 million dollars now where did the money go well it went to fund women's soccer and women's softball won't tell you how much Michigan football and a penalty flag he's a burner fog barrier if you figure that the Wolverines drove over a hundred thousand every time they play at home plus all the television busts all the other stuff that goes with it plus the fact Michigan's been to 16 consecutive bowl yes yeah I mean that's probably why you see armored cars collation least to the University of Michigan 42 to 710 17 Penn State beats Tennessee and we're sitting right now at the 48 yard line with Washington in possession on the Michigan 48 and the Huskies leading by 20 Michigan just scored on a 53yard run by Tyrone Wheatley and following us will be the u.s. FNG Sugar Bowl Notre Dame and Florida the Joe Hobart throws that ball down in the middle for his tiny and Aaron Pierce Sarah to Wolverines there and the Pierce does not kitchen not with Morrison and Anderson box hanging over the washington defense has been the single dominating force in this ballgame and that big fellow right there has been a major part is a we still don't know whether or not he's going to come back next year places in here he's a he's a he's a fifth he's a fourth year junior which was he's been in school for four years and he's had an insurance policy milliondollar insurance policy to protect him yes intended for Orlando McKay coverage by Wallace Michigan and it is incomplete it brings in fourth down and here comes upon it john merdell had a pretty good day for the Washington Huskies his shortest kicked 36 as long as 53 and he's hit it four times so far this is his fit and once again Desmond Howard goes deep Washington undefeated trying to win their 12th consecutive ball game this season four in a national championship nice job kicking that ball away from him Akeem here if you make him run to the sidelines with his back to the field most of the time you've got a chance at him that's Steve Everett he broke his jaw in the game against Notre Dame back early in the season that is just been an awful year for now spending Center behind student in graphic art nice young man it's been a miserable year for a football he's been playing then he hurt his ankle out here this week and was not able to play in the game today but he has another year left this is Wheatley they're gonna work him now Huskies have pretty much taken that to Matt Elliott right there who moved over from guard to Center replacing Steve Pemberton that was an adventure she likes to did some skydiving this past summer anybody jump out the jump out the guy that was on the ground out of oneway radio live isn't into his helmet and the radio went out he was supposed to direct him to a target he was banging on the side of his helmet with one hand and pulling the toggles with the other bareback blows Park and catch is made and Wheatley fighting for the first down and like you may have heard I reversed years years of running back to the future of Michigan it's pretty good one right there wide receiver Muriel Bailey a senior he'll be coming out many people east of the Mississippi ever heard of Mario Bailey before tonight couple of times he'd caught one more pass than Desmond Howard and Moriarty trails Desmond down by one touchdown chuckling a chance to go the line San Jose sacks in that ten tackles for a loss and for quarterback sacks for the Washington defense tonight we're going to show you some what they've been doing to Desmond Howard here's Desmond right here he's good just go run around at the sidelines but watch these safety as he goes over and helps double cover Desmond Hart he hasn't been getting this all night long but wants to safety to the left of your screen and I stopped it right there you see the two men on Desmond bust the side lineup he's had some single coverage but when he has had single coverage Grbac has not had a lot of time to look for after the SAP lets it no chanting gets the oil and they'll be looking at third down and 18 let's go back on the sack lost eight yards all right there six foot three two hundred pounds plus hurdler for for speed how would you like to get hit marker where's about two hundred seven or eight pounds and one in that fan so on that fast gonna show you the attendance after this play passes away Ricky powers we short of the first down pickup of about nine yards ever bring up pull down a huge across one hundred three thousand five hundred and sixtysix future hold on on fourth down they go for it and grbac gets it he threw a Hummer day yield Van Dyne and Van Dyne reeled it in and its first town Wolverines and they pick up 11 yards when they need it nine and a half you know Elvis Grbac keep coming into this ball game at a unique thing going with Desmond Howard they were the most prolific passing combination in the history of college football in terms of touchdown passes they have shown 31 touchdown passes between the two of them more than anybody else that has ever played college football inside hand crosses midfield it brought him down at the Washington 45 yard line now the Washington defense grows a little permissive Sonia Kashuk and hurrying without a huddle yeah I just talked about gir Bach and Desmond Howard they went to the same high school st. jolzi and Desmond only caught one pass from Goethe in high school it was a wishbone team they didn't throw a lot could you imagine Grbac as a wishbone quarterback worn from that to just outstanding recruiting I guess by both I can't imagine him as a wishbone quarterback hippie either I'm making what I think Bo went down to look at what did you see well I think you look at a Desmond what did you see that was a shot in the dark and put that on the ground he'll buy Michigan at their own 49yard line mark Melia is now in at center made the recovery and that thing is getting pretty slick for the Wolverine Center snap came back really hard that's hi there that manages to those two Van Dyne the receiver there's a gain a yard beyond the original line of scrimmage and so they'll be looking at third and nine Tommy Smith it's almost as if but keep that ger Bach is looking looking away from Desmond Miami's jump to lead Nebraska seven to nothing well this is definitely putting the pressure on Miami not only to win but to score and to win big Steve Everett is down with the delegate play something he's in there both sides Tournament of Champions the infinity a Tournament of Champions on Sunday January 12 on ABC Sports from La Coste Country Club top golfers winners got to be a champion to get in this tournament T it off in the final round of the Infinity tournament at 3:00 Eastern to Central and Pacific here on ABC Sports Sunday January 12 there's Steve Everett Michigan now eight penalties and 62 yards down inside the 45 down up to 44 here's Jack Bob Griese he said Bo Schembechler got lucky when he hit when he got Elvis Grbac he almost didn't get him at all you see his family for immigrants from Croatia they left in 1967 in the first place they went was to a relocation camp in Italy now they had a choice of two countries Australia or the United States they almost went to the Australians but what they did is they remember they had only one family that they knew in Cleveland that was from Croatia so they decided to go to the u.s. two of their children born here born in Croatia and pretty good kicker rolls around comes back upfield a bit and they will put it down inside the 20 at the 1880s corner but they're now been in this game 12 techel's for the washington defense for a loss and there have been five quarterback sacks so that's enough to get you a little at all I could make you downright cranky there's no question that the Dominus part of this whole game has been the washington defense washington offensively is play well but washington defensively sets the tone for the rest of the rest of the game and they've been doing this all year Billy Joe Hobart in there at quarterback with variable and him give it a man Jones the up man out of the eye not much well Washington wins this game Keith they certainly got a strong voice toward winning a national championship they're up there in the polls with Miami it might put some pressure on Miami to beat Nebraska as badly as Washington beat Nebraska earlier in the season well Miami jumped up and got a quick one against the Cornhuskers remember that black September I'm in black November Saturday a year ago we got up in the morning with all kinds of possibilities this is Barry carrying huskies now just chewing on the clock we had Ohio State at Iowa and we had UCLA a cripple team at Washington and in both Iowa and Washington wond and looked like we might have a national championship game in the Rose Bowl both lost otherwise the Huskies might well have been sitting there in the hall here going into the season well I sort of agree with both they're showing me some a good long time ago almost picked up it was intended for a Lando McKay and stepping in front is Martin Davis and he almost came down with it you take a look at these poles that are up around the country and of course everybody's got an opinion you get as many poles I guess is you've got opinions but the thing that they kept talking about this would be the perfect year to have your two team playoff after the bowl thinking Washington in Miami with both win well that's right but suppose you got yourself into a fix with all of that planning and all that commitment and they both lost they don't lose exactly have a mess now one of them loses and then you got the game plan you sold tickets for no chance it's been a the day of blanks for Desmond Howard he has one big play and that was all here you fold AP in the USA that they see it in Kochi people had Miami one UPI and the saccharine computer has Washington you can set and and argue about it to you Tom fella it wouldn't make any difference but as far as I'm concerned the coaches poll hasn't tired of the ticket before as I'm concerned this is the best kind of marketing there is that's for sure everybody talking about it Down Goes Todd coming the redshirt freshman from Walpole Mass and Todd got baptized by the Huskies defense by Donald Jones from Gladys Virginia and Donald told me where Gladys is oh it's down by Lynchburg I've been looking for Gladys all year now al Jones with his third sack of the game 13 total tackles for loss by the Husky defense now interceptive here's Jack well Keith you talked about that chase for the national championship of course he Washington Huskies trying to chase the Miami Hurricanes well Don James is a graduate back in 1954 great quarterback back there for the Miami Hurricanes earlier this year he revealed to us but he actually every year sends a donation to his alma mater I asked him if maybe that buy some books for some of the players and he just chuckled alumni dude that's what he says he says that gives me the right to complain if they don't win or if they win by too much it's not enough if you win now if you went by too many you know get on you if you don't win by enough they go on third and 19 a pass to the sidelines to Van Dyne out of bounds at the 29 and that obviously is a little well short of anything akin to her first down well both said a little while ago that that he liked Washington he thought we're looking at the number one game are you going to step up and say that is that you're feeling eating after after I see them today particularly that suffocating defense teeth I have never seen a defense quite that good particularly out here in the Rose Bowl I don't think we don't played against boom Tyrone Wheatley Rogers number 57 dancing around as garbage the beginning of the celebration I think for the Washington Huskies coming right behind us will be Notre Dame in Florida out of the USF Angie
