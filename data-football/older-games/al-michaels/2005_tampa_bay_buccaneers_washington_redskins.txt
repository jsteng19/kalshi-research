============================================================

ADC scores home of Super Bowl xlviii you to the following presentation of the back in a jammed pack Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida for the Redskins and the Bucs perfect football weather in the mid fifties Joe Gibbs a halloffamer in his second stint with the Washington Redskins and he has had a brilliant postseason as well 16 and 5 his career record his counterpart five and two in the playoffs but he is three and over the Bucks as he won a Super Bowl here and he did it against Oakland the team that he built and then left to win the Super Bowl with the Buccaneers Clinton Portis waiting for his chance but first it will be the Bucks Mike is this place electric or what I mean you absolutely know that this is the first round of the playoffs the first game that kicks everything off into the postseason I'm glad nobody in my neighborhood has the sound system in this Stadium I'd be deaf John Hall who had some lake problems earlier in the year has it teed up and Michael Pittman is back to receive Pittman volunteered for kickoff return Duty against the st. Anne averaged nearly 30 yards a return he has given them a big boost back there and they need him because it del Shepard has moved up to number three in the wide receiver spot Pittman from the foot team stays on his feet to the 38 yard line let's meet the Buccaneers offense our new Cadillac wheel Oh Mike Alstott Purdue University Joey Galloway Italian University of Florida Anthony Becht 2006 Sugar Bowl champions West Virginia diversity Anthony Davis versus Dan Bennett Wisconsin John Wade Marshall Shan Mei Han University of Notre Dame Kenyatta Walton Florida game great start for the box at their own 39 yard line they open with two tight ends and Cadillac Williams uses single setback and he'll get to carry across the 40 to about the 42 let's look at the Redskins defense full of Daniels Georgian Joe Salado Arizona today is Griffin University all of them could all to win no today Marcus Washington all the hospital the marmots visible state LaVon and North Wales have fought Harris Mississippi State University kids missing their best defensive back Shawn Springs is out with a groin in three for at least another week gang tackling by the Redskins Ronaldo win and Lamar Marshall from the middle linebacker spot well Cadillac Williams better understand something about this game no cut back against a team that set fast on defense especially when they're lying back as good as they are but Ronaldo win was the left defensive end came down and made the play on him got great numbers this guy the first rookie in the history of the league to start his career with three 100yard game Edel Shepard is in as an additional wide receiver on third and long for Simms blitz good protection now Danny go from behind Dmytryk evans the backup defense event with the first sack of the postseason and this is the first time that Chris Sims has been sacked by the Redskins he was on his feet all through the last game but you look at the pressure from the right side this is the biggest concern comes on inside right up the middle Chris Sims is not going to run away from anybody he can move but he's going to have to stay in the pocket and they're going to have to protect him Bidwell bo Boll putter kicks to Antonio Brown the speedster from the 25 slips lost the ball got it back at the 37 12 yard return let's meet the redskins offense Mark Brunell the University of Washington miss Bowie Utah State clean portage you James threats miss Arizona send them off you wop roll LSU Chris Samuels Alabama bear Jackie this is how about Leonard Ray Brown jr. Arkansas school John Janssen mission Ray Brown twentieth season in the NFL 843 he is a starter again after the injury to Randy chumps and he still doesn't sweat he is an amazing athlete Cooley is the man in motion Quentin horse against an outstanding run defense only gets you yard let's look at the Buccaneer defense Simeon rice from the University Chris Holden Cleveland st. ignatius Greg spires Florida State Derrick Brooks Florida State Sheldon Boyles bendigo Ryan nice you see La Ronde Barber Virginia Jemaine Phillips University of Georgia bitch thanks Waterston's Brian Kelly USC james thrash in as an additional wide receiver he's number 83 poorness off the right side nowhere to go you get the feeling this game is going to be a battle of wills yeah wills on every one of these guys you know think about it is when you take a look at this defensive line and also the Redskins look at how close these guys in our line of scrimmage now they're taking off and they're heading directly for cordis they don't care that you're going to throw the ball if you want to go throw the ball go ahead but Portis isn't going to gain anything on the Redskins committed or read committed should I say to the run in the last five games they've won them all and Portis has been on fire fourman rush on Brunell good time and throws coolly who has become his favorite receiver Mark Brunell really provides them with tremendous veteran leadership had a bad knee really last week against the Philadelphia Eagles wasn't able to stride and step forward good protection up front Chris Cooley works the middle of that defense you see the middle linebacker take off and get out of the way the numbers on Mark Brunell 23 touchdown pass and he's basically had two guys to throw to most of the year poured us again lowers his shoulder and picks up a couple ever since David Patten got hurt it's been the long pass to Santana Moss the short stuff to Cooley well you know it's amazing you're we sat in the meeting two days ago with Jon Gruden and said coach what about Cooley he said I can assure you we will have someone on him on every single down he was wide open but you're gonna play zone Hill work the middle of that defense Sellars is in number 45 in front of Boris good receive a terrific block and when else going to have to burn a timeout he didn't like the way the Redskins were lined up against what he saw as a blitz coming back to tamp in a moment Gibbs three Super Bowls 16 and five in the postseason back to do it again it took him two years to turn the Redskins around Mikan on that last play Chris Samuels was uncovered it was he tackled and the problem was and Tampa Bay pointed to him we're now suck call timeout what a smart play by Brunell in the dumb play by Tampa Bay Brunell goes to the shotgun in the spread formation blitz coming and he throws it away intended for thrash covered by Ronde Barber the probowl corner besides two terrific head coaches in this game there are two great coordinators defensively Monte Kiffin really like a head coach on that side of the ball john bruton gives him all of the autonomy he needs he runs that side of the ball for john bruton Bruton handles the offensive sights like having two head coaches and my Giffen is proud that his defense got to the rank of number one this year number one overall their sixth against the run sixth against the pass third and long another blitz Brunel dumps it off Ladell bets down to the 35 yard line a gain of 12 in a first down and here is a gun down as well Mike Kerry and his officiating crew working this playoff game outstanding group of officials what you saw was the veteran leadership of Mark Brunell just hanging in the pocket and then waiting till the last second to dump the ball off to Liddell bet holding while the quarterback still have the ball on an eligible receiver defense number 23 the fiveyard penalty first down that's Jermaine Phillips the strong safety was questionable coming into this game with a knee injury they'll mark it off after the 12 yards of the place of the Redskins with a good march into Tampa Bay territory to key third down conversions by Mark Brunell nice protection by the offensive line I think as this game goes on it's going to be how well the offensive lines protect their quarterbacks and how how much pressure the defense's can bring on them right now the Redskins all lines doing a good job Chris Samuels is really eat these heads up on Simeon rice on the topside the left side of the offense the right side the defensive they're letting him play cornell you saw four and four all those games in the Jacksonville Jaguars Porter's booked in to throw moths under cloudy it would have been a touchdown over Dexter Jackson but Portis hung it up in the air but I like what Dexter Jackson just did he's soft Porter's pull up and as soon as he did he headed for the end zone now he didn't really know where they were at Santana moth but when he got to the end zone he just everybody's yelling ball ball ball and that's why they make this call and watch what Dexter Jackson does he'll turn and then hit the ball that's perfect if he can throw the ball outside more Santana has a shot at it that weren't for a touchdown a couple of weeks ago poorness this gun swallowed up joven and dexter jackson came flying up from the secondary Chris Hovan was brought into this football team a guy who had to prove himself all over again was asked to change position he played the more aggressive of the defensive tackles they asked him to move over and the occupier the guy who controls the center he did it unselfishly and has been a big addition to this defense his career had really stalled in Minnesota another third and long for the Redskins another blitz and the past Wilin out about this was movement by the Redskins they were moving before the ball was snapped and it's going to be fourth down and the Bucks are going to refuse it they're not going to give Joe Gibbs and his offense another chance to convert a third down illegal motion premiere would be a 52yard field goal and at this point maybe out of john halls range I was watching John Hall during warmups Mike I really looking at it I'd say 46 yards on this day looks like his max so this one is definitely out of his range there's a Derrick frost we'll come on to kick there's a frost in the air dog is one on the ground it's going to be in the air though in a second one Mark Jones who is seventh in the NFL and punt returns waits at his 10 and flaws puts it in the end zone so the Redskins pick up 14 yards net and the Bucks of John Bruton will start from the 20 look at all the turnaround stories in the NFC for the playoff teams Tampa Bay the best at five and eleven along the Chicago Bears but the Giants went from six and ten Carolina from seven and nine and the Redskins from six in ten Michael Pittman will check in as the running back on this year Sims to throw the ball five 21 yards on the return Lavar airings it we saw this guy in the lobby last night he said I'm gonna hit him with my shoulder with my helmet I'm gonna do a whole lot of things he didn't tell us anything about intercepting Simms here's Harrington getting back in coverage this ball is hit Arrington just I mean just in the right position and does the smart thing man protect the ball when you're going to get hit that ball is batted Jos áliveá and in the first game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the defensive line of the Redskins batted three of them two by Philip Daniels because of the short sense of this offense they feel like they can get the ball batted in the air and they did salvia is an often overlooked with a very key member of this football team Bruton Brutus throwing a flag on this for whatever reason I don't know he's throwing a challenge flag my carry is gonna come over to talk to him I mean that ball right off the top of my head I can't think of what he might be challenging maybe they spot well he either that or your selves a shouldn't be allowed to tip anything good people that's a new rule for the playoffs new rule just for the district wild card games you could see Chris Sims indicate on the field it's an interception and the interceptor was downed by contact it is not a challenge of a play about down buyer contact I believe were fair I believe he thought that Arrington might have fumbled at the end of the play that would be the only reason why John would consider even challenging you see at the end of this play as Arrington goes as the bar goes down the ball actually does come out lands on it and you see the football but he was blown down by contact that is non with you and his knees were down his Aries were down Arrington's first interception suit mm in the I poured us the deep man cellars goes in motion porn us on the stretch to the goal line touchdown that's the kind of power that Clinton Portis gives you out of a back that you don't expect because of his size where I got it did I think Chris Holden missed him in the backfield he was coming down the line of scrimmage here comes port is right at you well I'd say that's power that is POW you run over your Co bollard Chris Samuels Derek dr. e on your left side that's about 300 that's 650 pounds worth of beef over there the redskins convert their first break off the interception Portis goes 5 yards for a touchdown Clinton Portis runs it in and the skins are on top of the Buccaneers after this pick 7 nothing it is sixth year in the NFL this is the first playoff opportunity for levar Arrington who is convinced he is not going to be back with Washington Redskins next year they will owe him a roster bonus and then an awful lot of money toward the salary cap Mike I believe he will be back I had a chance to talk to him this week he wants to be back Pittman is deep another short kick by Hall Pittman on the run behind the legend Pittman again takes it up near the 40yard line another terrific return james trash who is huge on special teams for the skins made the tackle the Redskins break on top thanks to that run from Clinton Portis coming up al michaels and john man will have the second half of our wildcard Saturday doubleheader Tom Brady and the Patriots start their quest for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title as they go against the Jaguars here on ABC the home of Super Bowl xlvii Bay's first four plays the three yard run plus a minus three yard run and eight yards second and interception that's it's not bad for Greg Williams defense you bet Cadillac warden is back in as the tailback Mike Alstott is the fullback Cadillac again dancing around the hole Phillip Daniels will let him outside Chris Sims had a career high in this last meeting they had in November three touchdown passes had a quarterback rating of 119 and the situation he's faced with now his kid he bounced back the first pass he tried to throw he was sacked the second one was intercepted this is a defining game for him I believe the Redskins defense probably a little more conservative than usual today because of the injury to Shawn Springs fourman rush Sims dumps it over the middle and Cadillac Williams not much let's go to Susie Mike Chris Sims did not appear flustered on the sidelines after that interception second series of the game it's a tough way to start but you have to appreciate the pressure that Sims has been under his whole career the extra scrutiny literally high school college the pros the Gooden marvels of how he's handled it and Sims believes even a tough time the leaves of Texas labeled not being able to win the big game it's all made and tougher tougher to handle situations like this short yardage here Seussian Alstott is the single setback to tight ends both to the right side all stop look at that power he's done it for years he is just such a superb much more than that Vince excellent blocking up front John Weidman and banning these stationary guys in the middle they're gonna run him up the middle Watson look at the wage block they block down and that hole is there now you talk about cool Cornish you're not going to bring him down with one man you're not ever going to bring this guy down with one arm he's only gained 85 yards rushing all year long but he has five touchdown runs short yardage he is almost unstoppable Sims with a deep drop plenty of time goes underneath that's the rookie tight end Alex Smith then Alex Pitt can't get back anything more than one original line of scrimmage when we had a chance to talk to Greg Williams last night and you saw it on that play he said what we want to get Chris Sims to do is start patting the football with me what he basically says is when that fact foot hits I want him not to be able to get the ball off in rhythm I want him to Pat it and have to look for second and third receivers they're gonna try and keep Joey Galloway out of this game as a Redskin defense they don't want him making big plays like he did the first time and Galloway is the key to this passing attack for men rush again Sims all stop this time in the flat breaks one tackle then knocked out of bounds as he got to the 40 if you joined us late here in the big plays in this ballgame Sims early on had the ball tipped by Joe Santo baya and picked by levar Arrington and the former allpro linebacker brought it back to the 5 where Quentin Hornets took it in for the touchdown that's where we stand 7 nothing right now the Bucs and Redskins territory at the 38 third and three Pitman checks it on third down blitz coming since underneath has the first down that's complete I figured before New York giant let me just tell you something that's happened in the last couple plays I've watched with Cadillac Williams in the game when Chris sends Joe crates to him the defense is there but once he fakes and he checks out of the backfield nobody's covering him and they've got to see this upstairs and they've got to just drop the ball off to him get it to the guy that can score for you in the open field he was after all the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year where's talent 234 Williams no place to go Redskins say the ball is Wilson they've got it still picked up by the skins that is visions of last week against the Philadelphia Eagles Sean Taylor with a fumble recovery that goes on into the end zone and I just got to believe that John Bruton somehow way shape or form will try and challenge this if he gets a looksee at it he's a big Cadillac did you drop it are you on the ground is the ball call the balls out the ball is out this is a is an outstanding call Marcus Washington was the man who hit him okay the only thing is gonna be a question here is that Cadillac Williams touch Marcus Washington well he was on the ground because he does reach his arm for the ball now if he touches him with Washington on the ball the ball will come back that would be the only thing for that just looks so much like the Eagle game last week for the Reds cousin Sean Taylor picking it up and making a big play for this defense again we will find out when we come back do the Redskins have two touchdowns or just one and possession John Gurdon Joe Gibbs awaiting the results of Mike Carey taking a look at the tape remember the call on the field was a fumble and a touchdown now the ball comes out right there you can see the ball is out as it hits the ground the question here is Marcus Washington touched while his knee or any part of his body is on the ground by a Tampa Bay pop here's you see now right there is a foot that is a foot in the lake of carnal Cadillac Williams trying to touch Marcus Washington did he touch him hey it looks like indisputable Evan the call is that he didn't touch him on the field that is correct so they have to find indisputable visual evidence that he was touched and over in order to overturn the touchdown and it isn't in either to may overturn because it I mean you in either case I can say this it looks like Chris Sims has settled down from what happened early in the game for him picking up some key first down by the each man after enduring the play there is no evidence that the recover was touched therefore the score is good Marcus Washington causes the fumble makes the initial recovery then when he fumbles it's their big time athlete at safety Sean Taylor who picks it up and goes for the score and there's a guy who did not play the first time that these teams played Sean Taylor up around the ball hitting people and this defense is swarming all over now balls on the gun look at him come from out of the screen and scoop the ball up and take it on into the end zone the Redskins defense turning into a turnover machine at the right time last week for in the fourth quarter at Philadelphia they have two in the first quarter here in Tampa on to that 14nothing redskins on top of the Tampa Bay Bucs and Paul I will ask you what did Chris Simms tell us was the key to this game the other day he said two days ago he said first of all no interceptions they have won no sex they have won and don't put the ball on the ground they have won and both of those those things two of those things haven't ended up a touchdown Wow and now it'll be interesting to see how Tampa Bay responds to what is an emotional shock being at home going down 14nothing Pittman the deep man again Paul a better kick this time to the five and the first time the Redskins have stopped in shy of the 30 here's where these teams would go depending on who wins Buccaneers against the Bears that's it the Bucs wins the Redskins would go to the Seahawks a team they have beaten this year Joe Gibson's you know I really don't have to do much on offense I've got a defense yeah yeah yeah you're right Cadillac Williams nothing that Redskins defense is swarming the line of scrimmage they said Chris Simms is the guy that's going to have to beat us it's not going to be Cadillac boy well they said that the first time it had happened but Cornelius Griffin in the middle gives them a tremendous presence I like what Jon Gruden did on that play he gave the ball back to Cadillac Williams he's basically saying I have confidence in you I'm not giving up on you and secondly he's not just dropping back and throwing against the team when he's down 14 threeman rush sims has to go underneath again and what Harris immediately wraps up Alex Smith the tight end you know what happened what happens on first down though is that the Washington Redskins defense they're on the line of scrimmage so they stop Cadillac for no game it puts fills her excuse me Chris Sims in a position where now he has to throw the ball on second down and he has to pick up at least five or six yards and they're not even getting close because a plane passing on second down and he has nowhere to throw the ball here's some really bad news for the Redskins Walt Harris is hurt they already have lost Shawn Springs for this ball game Carlos Rogers their rookie corner has just come back this week so they really don't have a starter in there in the secondary at corner and you have to wonder was Walt Harris hurt by someone other than Shawn Taylor because Shawn Taylor is just a missile coming flying towards anyone that has the ball could have been drilled by his teammate as he tried to drive the tight end Alex Smith out of bounds but they're still tending to them on the sidewalk don't you love this when you when to anybody asks the redskins greg williams especially what kind of a defense would you call this look can they say attack and that's all they do they attack you at the line of scrimmage from the secondary they attack harris was able to get up on his own and walk back toward the bench there you see harris on the ground and then all of a sudden you just see him get rolled over look like Warrick Holdeman may have gotten him with a knee in the side of the helmet Sims is five out of six but only for 19 yards here's the third long fourman rush Sims underneath but only picks up a couple and Pearson Prioleau comes flying up from a safety spot and they have this buck short passing game figured out right now sooner or later Jon Gruden in this offense is going to have to try and take a shot down the field with Joey Galloway whether he completes it or not he's got to back off those corners and those safeties of the Redskins bid well to kick and Antonio Brown will go back waiting outside the 21 of the fastest guys ever to wear a football uniform is Antonio Brown low line drive kick can't make the catch will get it the Redskins got it back what a break for Washington Torrie Cox just unloaded on Antonio Brown and now Tampa Bay since they have no they're giving it to Washington three Redskins covered it I don't know how they thought it came loose I'm gonna make a prediction right now Antonio Brown will not be back I believe that Joe Gibbs will turn to Santana Moss to put him back there to protect the Redskins in the kicking game I'm gonna tell you what Michael you say this guy is one of the fastest guys in football he's got to get in the open first for your fans well you just took his eyes off the bunny he sees the defender coming he doesn't try and catch that's the reason they cut him before so I would I would be surprised if Joe Gibbs leaves him back there I've got the Bucs fans back into it they're on their feet here in Tampa but the Redskins do keep possession Ladell bets has checked in as the tailback on this year and bets will get about three to the 24 yard line Antonio Brown had to wait a long time for that ball to come down after it bounced and then he paid the price that is precarious when you feel the defender coming at you and you just the ball doesn't get there quick enough it gets there simultaneously with the defender and that's usually the result of any really felt the defender after that you just get away from the Jew up 14 don't do anything stupid on a return the Bucks show blitz and it's bets again this time to the 20 Simeon rice cracking down from his right defensive end spot made the tackle well there's two places today on both of these teams where you really don't want to try to run a lot and that's right up the middle and then right up the middle they're just going to let you know they're not and what the way that the Bucks have played their defense they're walking their safeties up basically defying Mark Brunell to throw the ball down the field to the wide receiver another third along the Redskins vocals in fact I've already had several leads Brunell under pressure Hennessy CO and Mike Carey says it is income hit him but it is an incomplete pass I'd say a Simeon rice Lelouch sat down and talked to him the other day he just told us pointblank I'm the best defensive end in all of football now if you want to be that you say that that's okay by me I don't care I'm not gonna argue but look at him like Britt Samuel coming in I mean he is there in his face Chris Samuels keeps giving ground and Simeon just keeps on coming guess who got the ball in the end zone Simeon he said he was going to use his athletic ability because he was brilliant and you know what I agree with both those statements you bet I'm not gonna argue with him he has never been a shrinking violet Derek forced to kick Jones take him down at the 37 yard line 9 yard return after punt of 51 in the free game Simeon here's how he gets himself ready look at this he gets launched I mean he pulls himself in steps now he's at full speed I think with this guy on the first step he's at full speed Chris Samuel if he hits him the first time I thought he might have had a chance at the ball a very first shot at Brunel he missed them and then just stayed with it and came back and knocked the ball out I'm gonna make a venture if if the Redskins getting third and long again I don't think Joe Gibbs is going to leave Chris Samuels alone without having some kind of help over there a rice finished third in the NFL in sacks because of that speed and determination Sims underneath loose ball again goes out of bounds this time for the Bucs they get a break as Pittman made the catch was drilled by Arrington and the Redskins have another injury that's when Aldo when they're fine left offensive end the bucks the first four times they have had the ball there long drive is 27 yards that ended in a fumble it's been a study in ineptitude so far for Tampa Bay's offense you know it what's amazing in we're up here and they're down there getting whacked but I'm gonna tell you in a game any game not just a playoff game but you see Cadillac drops the ball Pittman drops impossible I know they're getting hit but your job when you have the ball in your hand as a receiver receiver as a runner protect the ball here's Ronaldo win number 97 actually his own man hits of Daniels it looks like his forearm his right forearm I believe hits Philip Daniels helmet and goodness only knows what happened to it he grabbed it and this is one of the few times this year that the Redskins have had win Griffin salivate and Daniel's all together on that defensive line well they brought the card out so it is serious just shame to see Ronaldo win a very bright charming guy you know you can see Philip Daniels right there and he is upset but he scored for the pastor he's doing his job it just so happens if you've got two defensive ends that are coming at the same point and they collide we'll check on the condition of rawl Renaldo win as soon as we can back to Tampa in a moment they have immobilized the right arm of Ronaldo wind to put them on that cart and certainly it looks like a significant enough injury to keep him out of the ballgame the good news injury wise for the Redskins is at wall Harris is back on the field and our best goes out to Ronaldo win well if you're the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensively and defensively what do you do now you've been shocked with the first quarter almost over it's 14 nothing I think the shock is the right word like you've been shocked but they put it pretty good drive together before Cadillac Williams fumbled the last time even though it was only 27 yards they have pretty decent field position it's a second down in five second down and six john bruton can still run the football you do not want to turn this into a game where you have to drop Chris Sims back and throw it constantly it's not out of hand yet Paul we've all seen it when you start making mistakes sometimes there are times where you can't stop it just avalanche but you the one thing that they just cannot do and with Drude that I don't think he will because he loves this offense so much and this is his offense you don't get away from your game plan yeah you're down 14 maturity in the first quarter of this football game you got three more to go they have not thrown a ball in the vicinity of Joey Galloway yet everything has been underneath this again intended underneath for all studs was hit by one of the redskins defensive linemen and knocked down again but chris sim cannot continue to throw that low ball into this defensive line watch these guys they're coming on up they'll up the line of scrimmage there's Daniel there's salvia I mean they're just they're just knocking above them and there's but Paul those are the ways those are the plays that are being designed john bruton is gonna have to call something down the field Galloway to the near side third and five Arrington maybe a little offside Lavar Arrington does not play a lot on 3rd down for the Redskins he basically plays only on 1st and 2nd down and if he does that again Gregg Williams is going to be really upset and he won't play on 3rd down you really have this team reeling now all the sudden you give them a cheap not well basically a cheap first down they didn't have to work for it they didn't have to earn it they haven't been able to get money on their own right now they got Galloway in the slot and he's in motion sins are going to hit gal in a little swing trying to use that great speed to get to the outside that's the innovation of John Bruton you find a way to get the ball to your playmakers now they restart the clock and that's the end of the first quarter the Redskins have stunned the Bucks 14nothing ABC's wildcard Saturday continues after this message and a word from our ABC stations ready for the start of the second quarter here in Tampa the playoff game between the Bucs and the Redskins Mike Patrick Joe Theismann Paul McGuire Suzy Kolber our entire ABC crew glad you could join us on a beautiful day in Tampa Florida Chris Simms facing a second and three with Cadillac Williams the deep man in the eye Cadillac gets the call for the first time a little Running Room and has the first down to the Redskins 41 do you know what that almost looked like the Redskins knew exactly where Catlett waves was going because just before the play the whole defensive line shifts to its right watch just before the plate look at this they're all in the line and Cadillac Williams goes up the middle where he sees an opening witness almost like they knew the count and the black saying I think this is the part of the place on the field where if you're going to take a shot it's a good place to do it Galloway the only wide receiver and Sims is rolling that wide grows underneath the catch made by Anthony Becht at the 31 near a first down Ryan Clark makes the tackle but the veteran tight end made the catch Joe you may want to throw the ball of joy Galloway but man I'm telling you they got two guys on him they had him all away John Taylor soon as he sees Galloway break he's gone here's Joey Galloway just take a look at this on the outside look at Sean Taylor 21 he's on his way that's what they didn't have in the first game the speed and the secondary and the safeties to be able to run with Joey Galloway that's the longest pass play for the Bucks so far today a gain of 10 Cadillac stutters Stephanie lost a couple of yards for Delia's Griffin what in addition he is back he did like he said we didn't play in the first game he just he really pet is a mismatch inside for anybody he's a piece he's over John Wayne now he just splits the middle to three people try and block him and Bank all of a sudden the running backs on the ground for a twoyard loss sins against the poor man Luck's finally gets pressure in his face this one is finally complete Galloway downfield is inside the 20 heads of this was outstanding blocking by this offensive life but your guy again Cornelius Griffin was back in the backfield with Chris Simms look at this protection first of all now Simms can look downfield he sees Griffin coming he takes his shot but Chris Simms stands in there it gets the ball of Galloway what happens is they bring Joey Galloway inside and it's a little bit more difficult for the Redskins secondary to identify and double them and he finds the soft part of the defense Rodgers and Taylor were talking to each other after the play as if the other one had blown the coverage Cadillac Williams up the middle again stuffed after a short game let's go to Sudan well let's go back to Joey Galloway and one of the keys to how well Simms and Galloway have connected they became good friends first just hanging out in the back of the stretch line and practice last year they bonded and as Galloway told me when he'd get to the field it makes it so much easier to communicate in the huddle on the sidelines and if you think about it we talked differently to your friend you hear him differently it's all about trust than they have it and we'll tell you another story about Joey Galloway and Jon Gruden in the second since under pressure down he goes at the 33 and it's Philip Daniels who tied for fourth in the NFL with eight sacks this year this is a case of the Redskins coming up and looking like they're gonna blitz and what they wind up doing is backing off and then the four guys up front Philip Daniels has had a heck of a time putting pressure on Chris Sims and then you see Chris Kelly's the other guy coming on in and finishing him off went right by Anthony Davis it's a loss of 13 john bruton said when when he was a young coach with the Eagles he went to Ohio State to work out Joey Galloway he said he ran the 40 in under four he thought he was running on a short field because nobody can run under for two sins again has to go out in the flat they should get about three yards to Ike Hilliard he'll go time if they got to put some points on the board like that face when you when you think about the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the buck fans will know this over the last two years they're kicking game has cost them more football games now Matt Bryant has done a good job coming in he's 10 of 11 from 42 49 yards and really has won some games form this year that was one of the biggest difference in their season last year going 5 and 11 with miss field though he's hit 21 out of 25 this is from 43 yards to get the Bucs on the board and Bryant right down the middle so at the 10:02 park in the second quarter Tampa Bay breaks the ice they're down 14 to 3 at home to the Redskins 10:02 to go in the first half the Buccaneers have scored the down 14 to 3 here at home the Raymond James Stadium Redskins have Ladell Benson James trash deep from that Brian's kick that's from the 11 with a running start powers his way across the 30 before he's pushed back Marquis Cooper with the tackle on special team the Redskins offense will take the field when we come back Redskins have the football of nine minutes and 56 seconds to go in the first half they'll start from their own 30 with an offense that has done very little against this Tampa Bay defense so far but realistically they haven't had too Brunell the throw on first down the outcome moths lost got away from Barbour the only reason he got away was because Ronde Barber slipped on that just like the Bucs want to try and get the ball in the hands of Joey Galloway the Redskins want to do the same thing with Santana Moss 84 catches almost 1,500 yards 17.7 on reception what a brilliant incredible year 14 83 is number two in the NFL and we have an injured Buccaneer we'll check on him when we come back to Tampa Quarles was the injured player the starting middle linebacker is able to get off the field under his own power stoned on a great blitz picked up by Clinton Portis Fortis moves the pile and hands the first down to the 44 Joe Gibbs told us last night he says you talk about a tough guy it's it's Portis now watch number 26 on Quarles 53 he stones him Lynn Portis told us yesterday her told her are you still be Joe Gibbs told us yesterday he says Clinton Forest said you know what when I'm running the ball they want to kill me he said when I don't have the ball I'm gonna go kill somebody else and that time he did look like he caught him with the helmet right under the chin and it just knocked him out Ladell bets checks in on first down he's number 46 there's the tailback and around moss night out of bounds he took a shot from Dexter Jackson but he picked up ten he's a tough little guy you start thinking a little bit about this Redskin offense and to me Clinton Portis comes in for a play and he goes out for a play now they fake it to Betts and again how do you get the ball in the hands of your fastest football player on reverses on swing passes on hitches Clinton Portis not in the ball game boys I thought he played more than he hits Dexter Jackson just depleted them on the sidewalk Moss just over his outstretched fingertips boy I'll tell you he put a move on Ronde Barber and I take if this ball is on target it's touchdown Santana Moss puts a move on Ronde Barber here it comes big big and he's gone run they grabbed him but he's in it's within the five yard zone so you can put your hands out thanks rip them they faked the hitch that time but credit to that front for making Mark Lee nail for a bad pass then usually boon L a great touch passer and missed on that that's student body left with Dell Betts keeping his feet barber holds him up and they take him out of the 42 let's check in with Susan well Mike after a great season you're see my Santana Moss is coveted by this team he added explosiveness that they were missing and from us it was all about an opportunity an easy decision to jump from the Jets last year just forty five catches almost double that to produce the second most receiving yards in the NFL almost every one it was have enough chances to be mentioned with the NFL he wondered if he would ever get the chance as he to live up to his potential hurt the first couple of years and then not considered the prime receiver with the Jets well he's a prime receiver now Brunell flushed he can still run and die the first down Mark Brunell needed an extra couple of yards stayed on his feet and got it it seems like in every game that the Redskins have needed down the stretch Mark Brunell has done it with his head with his arm but also with his legs this is just good enough he knows where the first down marker is does a little hurdle over Ronde Barber Simeon rice is coming up and watch Simeon goes by him he's rushing from the outside Chris Samuels is blocking him he lets him take the outside move bring out those inside you can tell that the place on that leg is restricting broom he's a little more mobile in that show Portis is back in against the run blitz got back to the line of scrimmage maybe a half a yard Bernal suffered a sprained leg iment in his right knee week 16 against the Giants when he was hit by a linebacker Nick Bryson and forced to leave the ballgame he did not miss a start though came back last week and led the skins to a victory over the Eagles to secure a playoff spot he had a clear high 23 touchdown passes this year and true for over 3,000 yards at second in law Brunell with time and flows out of bounds Jaron Bolden was there covering Moss but Brunel was going to make sure boss didn't get it nobody did Paul you made reference to that block that Clinton port has put on Shelton quarrel and quarrels about four or five plays ago while Clinton Portis has been in for one play since that I think he might have aggravated a stinger that and got last week in the ball game again the Redskins are probably out of John Hall's field goal rings they need to pick up some additional yardage to give him the chance that's gone so the 29 premiere would be about a 47yard field goal try Derrick Brooks the veteran allpro made the tackle I love what kickers come on the field John hauls no different than most he's whacking himself in the head you know I got to wake up because I have been out there for a while and I think I think that this is pretty much Israel in yeah I think this is pretty much on the outside of his range watching him in warmups Paul was hurt earlier of the year they used Nick Novak for field goals 47yard try plenty of distance and got it so John Hall counters the bucks earlier field goal the Redskins are back up by two touchdowns 534 to go first half the Redskins lead at 17 3 over the Buccaneers the two touchdowns really produced by the defense ball well you know this is this defense I can't this is an attacking defense that if you ask anybody on the defense what they do they attack here's Cadillac Williams he's trying to get some yardage there in the line of scrimmage now they intercepted on a tip fall by levar Arrington and here's Cadillac fumbling the ball and a recovery then watch how i lurk these guys are they just I mean and here the here's the SEC that's install it sinks into you know three things that can't do get through intercept can't take SEC we cannot put the ball on the ground it's none of all Michael Pittman deep to receive hauls kick Goodland this time Pittman driven back to the war tripped up as he got to the 20 Prioleau damn field made a onehand tackle there is a flag down on the play Mike Kerry to sort it out with his crew during the return holding by the receiving team number 58 10yard hillary hearth down the Bucs had the secondmost penalties on special teams this year only New Orleans had more in the kicking game Greg Williams one of the most respected coaches in the NFL has just signed a contract extension with the Redskins that makes him by far the highestpaid assistant he is to say assistant head coach under Jill Gibbs for defense but actually the defensive coordinators Cadillac Williams look like he had a little opening then gets drilled but Williams who has had all sorts of opportunities to become a head go to decided he's going to stay in Redskin territory for a while and a lot of clubs were concerned that there might have been something in the contract that would keep him in Washington you can't do that and he says there's absolutely nothing to it there's nothing in the contract that prevents him from leaving they just signed him an extension with a nice hefty raise and he will be able to go wherever he wants whenever he wants as a head coach but he doesn't want to know he is very satisfied worried Sims whose success is pinned underneath goes to Galloway and he swallowed up by Lamar Marshall but it's a first down for the Bucks that will be John grutas biggest challenge against this Redskin defense how can I find ways and where can I put Joey Galloway to get him in position to be able to make plays and get his hands on the ball Barrett is right across the middle working even around the linebackers this is not what you expect out of Galloway who averages 15 the half yards of catch but the Redskins have denied him anything deep but again underneath this is Pitman you know when you talk about Greg Williams Mike I think what makes him so special is he really understands offenses he understands what people want to try and do against his defense so he gives him one look and then changes up and does something else but the thing that he drives home is you have to tackle and you have to be aggressive he asks his football players to play certain places and get the job done and boy do they respond to him Cadillac makes a couple of cups takes it to the 29 yard line to think about him he came in quark meeting last night he had a big old briefcase and a bunch of notes and things and I basically woody we wanted to ask him was all right who's not gonna play and who's gonna play and tell us a little bit about your defense he was ready to spend the night and you know he really sitting down with it was like sitting down with Joe Gibbs I mean Greg had all the things on the defensive side of the ball you wanted to know coach Gibbs had everything on the other side of the ball that you wanted to know and it's the same thing with Tampa Bay defensive coordinators have tremendous autonomy from their head coaches they run that side of the ball third is short since wants to throw goes underneath complete for another first down to hill so obviously Tampa Bay doing what the Redskins are giving them which is the short passing game how about the credit you have to give Jon Gruden to cook really the fate of this football team in the hands of Chris Simms he has a lot of confidence in Chris Simms and what he's capable of doing Joe look in the middle of his field you've got two defensive tackles and we're spread out over the guards look at the room if you had a quarterback and his ever ran a quarterback draw he can run for 15 yards clock ticking down as we approach the twominute mark since man this face completes this one to his tight end Alex Smith Smith to midfield Smith the goodlooking rookie out of stanford and the butts moving with what looks to be their best drive with a ball game there at midfield two minutes left a man coming up on the Toyota halftime show Chris Berman Steve Young Michael Irvin and Tom Jackson they'll have the first half analysis of our game here in Tampa now Michaels previews two Jaguars against the Pats and the Pro Bowl starters will be announced for our game in Honolulu is it cold in New England you're cruel it's not here dribble nice here I got nice challenge I'm gonna love you for that Chris Sims 15 out of 17 today but only 94 yards longest pass play still tenth Sims again underneath could Galloway I am really impressed with Chris Sims patience Jon Gruden is calling a game and allowing his young quarterback to get set and find the openings in the holes in his Redskin defense now 16 of 18 I don't care who you are what the type of game is that's special and they're all on the money these aren't great catches these are terrific throws Redskins haven't blitzed in a long long time they've been coming with four men and they do again get written under pressure throws it away good job by sims to get out of there Dimitra Kevin's and Cornelius Griffin applying the pressure yeah we asked him yesterday or day before yesterday what he got from his father phil simms and he said I'd say what I got standing in the pocket and I got patience and it all came from his father you know and when this young guy was in high school he used to sit down with his father children they'd watch film all the time I mean this kid learned an awful lot from his dad standing in the pocket means you got to be tough you got attack shots he's tough he's a a he's a big hit kid he's a big man here comes the Blitz and they got it Gregg Williams said he was going to be very judicious with it Omar Stoudemire came flying up from the safety spot that time and when they have come with it they've made it count the classic example of a delayed blitz Omar Scott Meyer number 23 he's back in the back Sam look at the delay he waiting for the hole open and once it did he had a straight shot at him it looked like he was 20 yards away he was he was and he I think he tried to get Walt Harris to drop back to the middle that might have been a blown blitz which the Redskins lucked out on see the discussion that's going on on the sidelines secondary guys sometimes miss communicate that when they got away with Tampa Bay moved the ball very well but now they have to punt and Antonio Brown is back waiting on bidwells kick fair catch at this time and makes it at the 14 36 yard kick no return 30 seconds to go in the half let's check in with Susan Mike the big story of the game has been play of this Redskins defense one of the best in the NFL at the bar Arrington it's his first playoff appearance and he makes the best of it with the interception led to the Clinton Portis touchdown to make it seven and the Redskins just kept on coming Marcus Washington who leaves this Redskins defense forces the fumble Sean Taylor who missed the last meeting picks it up and takes it in from there he'll go field gone but the Redskins with a 173 lead going into the head and susie right now they have no interest in doing anything but taking a knee and going to the locker room to talk about the final two quarters who will playoff game against the Bucs what a first half for the Redskins both defenses have played extremely well and it looks like Tampa Bay's offense has found some rhythm but that's a little bit of the problem you run into when you start to commit to throw in the football lots of things can happen Joe Gibbs has never lost the ballgame when he went to the locker room with the lead that's the story the first half from Tampa let's go to Chris Berman boomer the Redskins defense swarmed on the Bucks offense this afternoon and they have taken a 173 lead Redskins over the Buccaneers welcome back to Tampa Bay everybody and you've got the feeling in that first quarter the Redskins really shocked Tampa Bay what do the Bucs have to do to make a game of this in the second half well I think they move the ball quite well to be honest with you I think they have to try to get the ball to Joey Galloway down the field the first game they had big plays they had four plays over 30 yards in that first game they need to generate some kind of chunks of offense to be able to get in position to put some points on I don't believe they can complete short passes this second half and make up 14 points in this game Paul I would assume the Redskins would like to see some more offense they have not moved the ball all that well but they're in control of this game they are and they will not get away from Clinton Portis I'm gonna tell you now they're Santana Moss is being covered he's not getting open either but they've done which we talked about yesterday the day before let's take the two wide receivers out of the game and let them play football and that's basically what they have done yeah the Redskins will continue to give the ball to Clinton Portis and the Redskins will get the ball to start the second half and Joe Gibbs who is undefeated in his career when he's gone into the second half of the lead has it right now there's levar Arrington who had the first big turnover of the ball game a tip pass that was intercepted taken back deep in bucks territory where Clinton Portis scored first things first bucks on defense they've got to take the ball away they've got to create something on defense first before all these other things happen well that's what the Redskins did I'm also curious Clinton Portis has been in and out of the lineup with that stinger right after he hits Shelton quarrelled with that great block it looks like he might have aggravated I'm curious to see what his status is now he's putting a jacket on and the Redskins are gonna get the ball on offense so I'm not sure whether we're gonna see him or not Bryant will kick off Liddell Betts is back for the Redskins taken by one of the up men sellers has it sellers was in the wedge but on the very short kick takes it back to the 31 you know when you talk about quick quarters you're talking about how he runs here he is away from the ball and then the guy that he is hit he's not hitting back this guy's happy he's dancing what does he hit Brooks linebacker world's linebacker and stone squirrels I'm gonna tell you what this guy is a tough guy vets will take over the running back spot as Bordas remains of the sideline and obviously something is not right with Clinton ports blitz coming BET's bigger and a harder inside runner although it's really more difficult to find somebody that runs harder inside didn't ford us here are the first half numbers total yards both teams under a hundred the one number on there that counts more than any the two turnovers because those set up the two redskin touched and also time of possession almost to the one for the Redskins which was the way it was in the first game the Tampa Bay excuse me that's again nothing I'll tell you one thing that it changes the entire complexion of the Washington Redskins offense one German tortoise isn't in the ballgame they now all they really have to concern themselves with our two guys mas and Coulee now coolies only caught one pass in the first half he was wide open so apparently campers late in the judgement well Betts is a good inside runner but he doesn't have the speed that for the skin to break the big ones Rinella the shotgun empty backfield and down goes Brunel at the 33 the pressure came right up the middle for MELAS wins number 96 he did but I'll tell you what they did they lined up on a line of scrimmage and they hit Jermaine Phillips hit coolly coming off and he had no place to go take a look at Cooley 47 Bay he gets hit right there there you got him covered that was an opened up that was Ray Brown that wins came around Ray Brown at 43 years old playing right guard Mark Jones forced back to the 25 versus his field he's got a chance to get a penguin and the punter Derek Ross joke use some speed that may be the fastest putter that ever lived and he's hurt in stereo frost could have saved the touchdown as it was the return was 23 Redskins on top 17 three Derrick frost being 10 to 2 on the sideline he was able to walk off under his own power he made a brilliant ploy to save an even bigger game on the kick return Cadillac Williams trying to get outside taking hit after hit after hit picks up about four Frost goes down hard on that right shoulder you know kickers just aren't used to bouncing off the ground I mean they're trying to make sure you know everything's all right inside the old eyeball when was the last time you heard of a punter and a tackling drill not said to play ball thank you very much they've got big cake Sims has another one knocked down looked like salivate got it Salameh is timing this stuff perfectly Gregg Williams I talked to Greg Williams the defensive coordinator of the Redskins about knocking the ball into the ground and what he basically says is what our teaching are off our defensive linemen do a guess against Chris Sims because he gets rid of the ball with such short drops take two steps of penetration then find his arm and try and get the ball up 16 out of 20 but only 102 yards for Simms everything underneath Griffin jumps but he got back unless you touch somebody it's not a penalty Sims again over the middle Pikmin wide opening Shawn those helmettohelmet minh takes him down at the 20 for a gain of 23 yard what a nice job by Chris Simms just steeping his composure everybody jumping offsides steps up in the pocket well I want to move Pitman put on Lamar Marshall the middle linebacker number 98 you mentioned it before Paul the middle of the football field has been exposed whether it's Chris Simms having an opportunity to step up or whether it's Joey Galloway or Michael Pittman running in the middle yeah they're given really in the middle of the field and they've been doing it this is now into the third quarter doing it that was the parting of the Red Sea Sims on a boot inside you really like about the end of this play this Beckett really has two choices I can I could go out of bounds and save my body or let me just go ahead and punish somebody watch this pain have a eat your food these pads you talking about contact on the field now they're holding on to the football which they didn't do in the first quarter former number one draft choice of the Jets out of West Virginia had to get that in I know you Jameel cooked with allstar in the back inside the bar he just ran over Ryan Ryan Clark I had to believe that he was standing on a train track and it was the local coming at him number 25 comes in to try and fill the hole he hits them and just gets bent backwards I said this this is pilot when you when you watch all stop run we talked about it looking at Phil Joel on him and so when he hits the hole his shoulders are square now these hits I'll tell you what his shoulder pads have to be about six feet wide first of all it's not his shoulder pad then they get wider but he has really squirmed in the line of scrimmage and man does he got low Ryan Clark is not the first guy he's run over the wheel cook is in front of him now and you just got a feel that they're going to give the ball all spot going up in the middle they only have about it Alstott had two touchdown runs of the twopoint conversion the first time they met all in short yardage boy he had no place to go there this time salivate came in and got down around his knees if I'm Jon Gruden on the offensive coordinator I have to consider running a bootleg or a playaction let the Redskin defense all converge on Mike Alstott and then go around and make a play you know you're you really have to sell your body when you're down on the goal line get just this stuff doesn't matter these guys are flying around that's Campbell number 50 that just jumped in the middle eight things you know nothing there's nothing sacred down here go not the place for the faint of heart third and tight formation but one we threw that ball into that ship that's a pretty good arm we threw it right into the ship right into one of the cannons what a play dan bending let him around the corner look at it watch the cartoon abetting number 72 fan and he only has to do is make a little bit of contact it seems right manage this any good make sure the ball goes over the pylon you see that that goal line extends to infinity the first touchdown of the game for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the point after makes it seven to ten and that got the crowd back get it john bruton and Chris Simms what a time for Chris Simms first rushing touchdown of his professional career and he threw the ball away his dad should have taught him better than that you say the good souvenirs the Redskins tell us there is nothing wrong with Clinton Porter's Ladell bets on the return hammers out to the 35 on a great play call Britt Sims on the bootleg scores the only bucks touchdown of the game back in Tampa where it's a sevenpoint game go Redskins take over at their own 35 Clinton Portis who racked up 144 yards the first time these teams met the high for the year against the Buccaneers defense has been held the less than 20 in this game Moss he is so quick ran right around Brian Kelly like I believe in momentum in life in anything you do and right now the Tampa Bay Bucs defensively they stopped the Redskins the first time they've gone down and scored a touchdown they now have momentum on their side when you're on the road you have to pick up at least two or three first downs to try and take some of the steam out of this crowd Santana Moss was leaning to the inside as he made that get immediately wheeled toward the sideline and got a first down like he bobbled that toss finally recovered it got across midfield Clinton Portis ival is a better back if he plays more spotting him like the Redskins are doing is not really the way that Clinton Portis is effective he needs to touch the ball 2025 times and the longer game goes the more he touches it the more he gets lather second and five bored us again first down and more porn us to the Bucks 44 yard line Derrick Brooks made the tackle asset 1 we can't when they come back you got to get him back involved in the ball game and get the ball look Clinton Portis because once you do this and that's two runs in a row both of them a little over five yards and he picks up 11 total the two runs but the more you do this the more the outside opens up and you've got to get it now at the time when you want to see a deep one to Santana Moss Joe Gibbs said Portis is one tough dude he just goes looking for people to hit Brunell dumps it to Portis and he gets laid down hard Ryan nice hit him and then Ronde Barber comes up the tattoo wow this is one of those deals where you eliminate your running back I mean there's really no reason that I mean if you're smart and a quarterback I know you're trying to get the ball away you can get it back to the line of scrimmage but don't dump it to a guy that doesn't have a chance to do anything there are two guys in front of Clinton Portis he catches the ball but as soon as he does he gets whacked that was only for your fiveyard loss sorry we're up here and they're down there but you don't throw that pass bet comes in on second in law we're now strained : Brunell had the best shot at it and may have gotten it Derrick Brooks was the man who knocked it loose Chris Samuels had the first shot at it right now if this is a heavyweight fight the cards are starting to line up for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensively they're putting balls on the ground the only thing is is they're not recovering they've had two opportunities for fumble recoveries they haven't come up with either one great hustle by Chris Samuels just to keep the ball alive Roy now yeah that was great hustle by him and Derrick Brooks made a tremendous move to get away from Casey Rama third the mile we're now throws it away Moss was out there double covered me and the Redskins will have to punt it away and their kicker Derrick frost has been treated on the sidelines for an eye injury but you know what this defense and they've been playing well all night long you got to remember that in the first quarter the defense got the ball twice went on the touchdown and then Derek tanner interception that they took in for a touchdown this offense for the residence they have not done a thing Mark Jones backs inside the tenon makes a very light fair catch signal 49yard punt and no return for his sims scored the only bucks touchdown he's got the ball back when john curtin led the bucks to a win in Super Bowl 37 he was the youngest coach ever to win one at age 39 they hit him with that bucket of water during the almost drank the whole bucket he's telling them to do it he's defined you look up intense in the dictionary you see John's pictures how you see Chucky's picture Cadillac Williams trying to get to the outside part is there takes him out of bounds let's go to Suzy Mike that last book series fits perfectly into what Jon Gruden told me at halftime despite his young quarterback making just his 13 start he said he is calm cool and composed no problem we just have to block better for her and remember what Sims told us the best thing about this team is they are battle tested they've had to rally lots of time this is buck football it's not pretty but we don't quit and Susie that last carry was the first time Cadillac Williams had been able to get outside the entire game he's got it again this time inside and spins for what could be enough for a first down the numbers on sims tremendous percentage 438 yards look at the numbers on Brunel 6 out of 12 only 36 yards he's only been able to throw the ball 12 times the entire game I like the confidence that Jon Gruden is showing in Chris Sims as a matter of fact when he took over for Brian Griese in week 7 he said he put in more and gave the kid more to think about now that's a real credit to a coach to challenge his young quarterback out of the eye this time Sims on that poop under pressure throws to bec and he is thrilled the moment he touched it by the rookie Carlos to Rogers the Thorpe Award winner out of South Carolina who's been hurt a lot of this year but Beck got hurt and he walked off on his own but it's it's just surprising that he held him that held onto this football what's his hit catch bang and he held it you get the sense in this game that Joey Galloway is a keg of dynamite and you're just waiting for the fuse to be lit two tremendous defenses battling each other this afternoon since again screen to audience no place to go tries to make a couple of guides miss what defend the screen turned out to be three defenders you know if he is funny if you didn't know it when you look at it you would think that the Washington Redskins were the guys who are running this screen wouldn't you because there were the only guys out there I don't know what happened to the offensive line when they throw this play watch your left hand side of the screen folks all you see are white shirts the law offensive line never got out to the outside but the defense sure did big play here third and nine approaching your threeminute mark third quarter three men lost this time Sims could have try to run Martin gets Washington was waiting for him Griffin was there I could believe in that headset that Jon Gruden said to Chris just don't do anything stupid and he didn't he did a good thing now handle these at the end of the play people were wolfin at each other and one of those woofers was Sean Taylor which he is he's a Wolfert after the ball is dead personal foul and fourth way conduct defense number 20 Tail the plays over you force him to punt that's Pittman he's talking to watch this folks all right here we go Pippin how do you how do you do this now wait a sec this is something that should be reviewed upstairs you cannot give a 15yard penalty to a player that did nothing when the other player hit him that's terrible I'm very curious to see what the officials in the booth are going to do this is an extremely man called it's not reviewable and an unbelievable mistake see in a game of this magnitude in a game of this magnitude the officials should not be allowed to make this kind of a mistake and you know if it was Sean Taylor that hit Michael Pittman and that happened then I would have said the same thing that is an absolute terrible terrible call that means that nobody saw anything they just drew a flag instead of hunting the Bucks have a first down at the 37 of what a momentum changer and then Cadillac Williams drilled at the 40 this is a shocking call Sean Taylor is right in the middle number 21 our watch would now only John all he's doing is John that's all he's talking he hasn't now no flags have been thrown Kerry starts to step in Michael Pittman hits Sean Taylor and they charged Sean Taylor with the penalty I've got all a respect in the world for this officiating crew but they missed that one the worst part about it is Sean Taylor is now on the bench since kept in the air again well hopefully that call will not have anything to do with the outcome of this game but that now unfortunately the other part of that is a coach is mad at Sean Taylor they get mad at him for creating and giving the Bucs this opportunity and so the coach is mad at him and he the bus get a first out and nothing is he didn't deserve it well look at the players on the sideline they're not even talking to him and he may be the referee heard him say something but that vid used the swing was by Pittman and now sims will have to burn a timeout because the Redskins were at the line of scrimmage to blitz the biggest event in sports is coming to ABC Sunday February 5th will the Patriots win an unprecedented third straight hole will a new champion emerge join ABC and Detroit to find out pregame coverage to Super Bowl 44 February 5th and 2:30 Eastern on ABC screws Monte Kiffin was out in the middle of the field the defensive coordinator I don't know what's he thrown out of the game they didn't say anything Sean Taylor is not leaving the field going to the locker room well he has certainly had his problems but if he's being punished for this they're wrong he was ejected from the ballgame we are told and now it's taking on ridiculous before Sims wants a screen throws incomplete to Pittman and a great job by Lamar Marshall right in the middle of that screen let me make a point here Sean Taylor did not play the first time that the Bucs played the Redskins so this defense can do it without him Joe what happened was the word we got is the spit in Pittman space and that you spit in my face I'm gonna smack in on account beg you if he did that and the referee saw it then he deserves the penalty and deserve to be from man the official is correct but he really put his teammates in a terrible spot and Tonio Brown is had a crew in play cheering others down boy hit him five yards out of bounds hey what are you what are you thinking about this is a game that has the potential to get out of hand and I'm sure Mike Kerry is going to keep it that way obviously he did with the Sean Taylor situation both these defenses are playing at a very very high intense level well here we go you tell you're out of bounds well excuse for that one I mean the guy's almost passed the white line and he gets hit personal foul and this is a rough picking team number 43 15 yards first ever let's come back to the call on Sean Taylor and if if what is being relayed by the officiating crew and like we said we have all the respect of the world from Mike carrying his group if they saw Sean Taylor spitting in the face of an opponent then it is a deserved 15yard penalty it was just before the head slap you could see his head Bob a little bit but tell me what do you guys in Summit split your face you're not going after Aries right there he he had to see it he make the call made the call red skins ball with the 49 to sit turned out it didn't hurt them on that drive but they lose the tremendous speed and hitting ability is John Taylor and everybody is getting really chippy out there sent me on rice and one of the Redskins were going at it a little bit after that play it look like Robert royal it tight in now you're starting to come down to one final quarter of whether you continue to play in the tournament headed for the Superbowl or else you're done you pack your bags and you go home and both of these teams have played so well down the stretch the skins five in a row Tampa Bay four out of five to qualify they show Blitzen come with it Portis with a seem off the left side can't quite get out there well you know what the Washington Redskins and is he said four out of five for Tampa Bay but the Washington Redskins they've been in the tournament for the last six weeks they've had to win their last five games in order to get in and they knew that when they started those five games and they want them all and they put them here I mean that's great Joe Gibbs has lost one in the postseason that was all the way back 19 before guess who may be the best defense we ever saw and guess who lost me go Theismann lost it wasn't your fault sure was I saw the game with jokes fault we're now trying to keep the drive alive got it trash taken out by barber but it's a first down at the Bucks 38 and that's the end of the third quarter as well the Redskins 17 to 10 the wild card Saturday continues after this message and a word from our ABC station the oldest and youngest head coach in the NFL they have each won Super Bowls Joe Gibbs his 1 3 they share a passion and enthusiasm for this game Redskins first and 10 from the 38 Portis picks up a couple before he's first out of bounds by or forced out by Jackson you watch this defense go down the line of scrimmage now you know the speed of Portus and you watch him going down the line of scrimmage but on the right hits look at lefthand side you look at this look at this limit the pursuit the pursuit the pursuit all the way down the line of scrimmage and Portis loses a half a yard but that's great pursuit by this defense 17:10 the Redskins offense has been traveled nearly the entire game rice on top of Brunel trying to steal the ball and gets the sack anyway he grabbed his jersey brunella should have or could have gotten away from him except to talk about strength your legs your arms how about Simeon Rice's hands watch this there's Chris Samuel there he's got him by the shirt and he didn't let go he had him with one hand and the guns he flew it in they made the mistake again of allowing Chris Samuels to try and block Simeon rice oneonone they've got a chicken with the tight end they've got to chip him with the back or he's going to wind up all over Mark Brunell stop sellers or bets rather to the 46 and the Redskins we'll send on the punting unit Simeon rice not only can he rush the passer but watch his movement down inside he's waiting for this draw play or this handoff and he goes right back to the inside I mean that's just outstanding play by a defensive end the Dale Betts had no chance and that's the only play they really could have run without risking an interception frost will kick to Jones and the Bucks defense certainly doing its part cross hangs this one up and Jones must it and got it back 31 yard kick and an exciting muff by Jones but the Bucks will have the ball when we come back here's what the Redskins and Buccaneers are playing for today to advance in the NFC if the Redskins win or if the Buccaneers win rather they would play the second seed the Chicago Bears as the Redskins win they will go to Seattle Williams on the toss wawk wawk harris just had Cadillac Williams for a fiveyard loss didn't he this young man is very impressive he does a wonderful job of keeping his balance talk about keeping your balance after the initial hit he barely gets the ball Walt Harris number 27 right there right on top of them and he still manages to pick up three yards Marcus Washington told us last night the Cadillac Williams runs 30 pounds more than he weighs well he's a keeper Sims has been very successful in that short panting did gross underneath again Galilei makes the catch at the 24 let's check in the Susak make a lot on Kristin shoulders remember the turning point of this season for the boxers when they beat the skins back in week 10 it also lifted Simms to a new level he had never led a gamewinning drive his whole career he told me even dreaming about that since the seventh grade the ability to lead a team back is what separates the great quarterbacks from the average ones and the confidence to know no matter what the situation you can find a way to pull it off the susi not much as far as numbers are concerned except the percentage but he is doing exactly what he has to do right now throws underneath again Galloway for a very short game of course it's almost 20 years ago to the day in the 1986 NFC Championship game that Phil Simms led the Giants to a 17 nothing victory over who else Joe Gibbs in the Redskins give to has a 661 career win there's only five in 12 head to head when Phil Simms played quarterback to the New York Giants H to draw fourman rush in here comes the present Griffon can't get him sim still on the run now present makes the catch his fourth of the day Sims kept the play alive till he could find someone our Marshall almost killed him at the end of this thing Lamarr Marshall lay Zuma watch what Chris Sims does watch after he gets passed here now but once you've set himself he's going to square himself up to make the throat and in Marshall whacked him what a plight what an individual play of the 10 games he has started he has had four fourthquarter comebacks the kid just loves these type of stages when they're gonna love him for it with this kind of success Cadillac shakes one tackle and picks up three Joe the way they're 48 the way they're hitting down here let's not call him the kid anymore call him a kid at the beginning in them and I think he's he's a man he's Chris Sims quarterback that's a darn good one 17 to 10 Redskins the skins defense scored one touchdown and set up another every time you see on that thing chart with Sims were the interception remember that ball was kicked seems to gallo we Harris and here come the Buccaneers a gain of one this isn't fair for Walt Harris this is just not fair because Joey Galloway is one of the fastest men in the entire National Football League and watch what they let him do they got Harris trying to catch him inside and when he's down Harris just shook his head after the play was over they do a nice job of running the route clear and inside you can't say enough about this Bucs offensive line overall they've had their moments but overall they've done a terrific job giving Chris Simms a chance to be able to throw the ball seven catches 69 yards Cadillac Williams Harris ends up finishing him off at the 25 Sims on this Drive has gotten more production than any other drive of the day four out of four 53 yards passing and the one he kept alive on his own with his quick feet you know we talked about this all the way through this game Joe but the middle of this defense is open it's been open all night long if he has the time to throw it and to get people in there because her open the linebackers are opening up the middle here comes the Blitz they don't get their sims out in the flat William Shakespeare Williams close to immerse down Cadillac Williams sets up Lamarr Marshall this is almost unfair when you have a back that's this shifty and this good in space you're asking a converted safety who now playing linebacker for the first time to try and cover him and tackle him that is a nowin situation for the Redskins huge play here is us not in the game I believe he is he is the up man Cadillac is the deep man and all stop we'll get it goes airborne this will be close he had to get beyond the 18 yard line if he didn't get beyond the 18 they don't have it he might be short now if you're Jon Gruden you've gone on fourth down in the last game and managed to get it you've been feeling really good about your short yardage go in goal line offense do you go for it here look at Marcus Washington you know what if it's short I go for it because the Redskin offense has done absolutely nothing migrate and instead of kicking the field goal I would put my defense right back out on the field figuring I'm going to get the ball back and then I'll have a four down run if I need it oh they're gonna be measurement to see how far they really have to go they're all it's gonna be almost a full yard almost a full yard you know what happened here he is all stop they had him close to the line of scrimmage there it is it's almost the yard he didn't have enough momentum to get himself up in the air I would have put him back at the cook in front of him in that pull back in that halfback slot and then no hesitation I've run the playaction here whew somebody should be wide open if he ones playaction it's a gutsy call but what the heck John Gruden's made his living on gutsy it sure worked when you called for it on the goal line here they come and John Gurdon wants a timeout well he didn't like the defense he saw 741 to go back after this Joe Gibbs with perhaps the hottest team in football a winner of five in a row with 741 to go in the game has a 1 touchdown lead over john bruton but the Bucs fourth and one this could be the game on the line all stop the deep man Sims fakes pressure in his face and clothes in the Redskins brought the house Marcus Washington in the face of Chris Sims and what a courageous call by Gregg Williams the skins defensive coordinator and I don't have a problem with the call by John Bruton the thing is is if you make that call and he gets the first down fine if not you put your defense back on the field that's not bad for the Bucs either Raymond James Stadium in a frenzy they know their defense has to step up now the Redskins took the ball back on downs Ladell bets is the single setback behind Brunel and Betts takes it across the 20 on that last play you'll see Marcus Washington is not fooled he's going to go after the runner Lamar Marshall the middle linebacker goes out into the flat to coverage Emil and he's got he's got him out there Jamil cook everybody's covered nobody went for the fake I don't think the bucks often sold it very well but the defense of the redskins reacted extremely well that Redskin defense has been brilliant clock turning towards seven minutes the Redskins offense has done nothing against Tampa Bay defense in the second half that's is green Shelton quarrels the middle linebacker just brushed I'm gonna tell you what you would talk you talking about the Redskins defense look at this defense watch and penetrate the line of scrimmage hey honey they just i Lincoln says the penetration there pendrick there's barber who's a coroner is up there there it big and Clinton Portis is not in the football game and hasn't been on this series the Redskins have gained only 22 yards in their last five possessions what a defensive ballgame this has been we're now in complete Moss was open he couldn't hit him the clock is stopped with 609 to go and the Redskins will have to give it right back to the Bucks that took a little over a minute you know I love that the Gruden went for it I don't like the play that they called because they ran an allout pass pattern they didn't even show run at all to fake him but they the right thing Joe of you're talking about they put their defense on the field and they got the ball right back for us to kick to Jones a puck should have great field position nice high kick Mark Jones at the 31 and takes it back to the 35 so the Buccaneers 65 yards away from tying the ballgame boomer it's a lot hotter than the weather but steak over at the 35 what a ballgame Cadillac Williams to tailback fourman rush on Sims avoids to then he's calling out Carlos Rogers when he goes out of bounds he says come on hit me what a great job by Chris Simms I'd say that fake and fake just kind of froze a few people Sims goes back in here watch this he looks like he's going to get sacked right there and that at arm swing and he gets himself to the outside picks up some blockers and don't antagonize the defense please don't do that Paul oh man oh man oh man don't do that that's another thing he has from his father sim steps up too high for Galloway he was open now he had beaten Ryan Clark to that open area and he missed them Greg Williams talked about Phillip Daniels being a pass altering what he did that time is he didn't really hit crit Sims but he forced him to alter the delivery of the throw and it goes up high Joey Galloway gets in the hole one of the rare times he's been open on the outside but it was the pressure from Phillip Daniels that caused it another huge white the numbers on sims approaching 200 yards can they keep the drive alive fourman rush says Sims has time steps up and throws incomplete Stoudemire came from behind on the tight end Alex Smith the crowd wanted a flag but they will not get it this is this is the difference when you have a rookie tight end Alex Smith runs a nice move and it looked like Omar Stoudemire really got his hand around them but he'll learn to come back to the ball even a little bit more that just looked like perfect timing on stout Meyers Park and now they'll punt it away Ben well to kick to brown returnable ground gets away from this one far away good idea while we have a moment we would like to thank our entire Sunday Night Football production team bringing you today's telecast led by our producer Jay Rothman our director chip Dean our technical director Mark Kirk Fox and thanks to our executive producer Jeff Drake also here with us in Tampa the executive producer of ABC Sports is Mike Pearl and the executive vice president of ABC Sports is Norville Williamson when you start to look at the end of this football game if you're the Redskins you want to be able to get at least two first downs that guarantees you about three and a half minutes off the clock if you're the Bucs you want to shut them down force of the throw becoming complete and stop the clock to help the home run hitter Portis is in there at tailback and there's a flag on the play cornice takes it out to the 22 yard line there have been very few penalties in this game this one's going to go against the Redskins and this place is going to go nuts illegal formation the only thing the Bucks have going against him right now with about what 504 to go they only can they all right they have the twominute warning I know Joe was going to say that so I got it in the head of town but they only have one other time right they have one time if that's that is the only thing is guessing because defensively they are bringing it where Red's gives offense has been totally frustrated today in Tampa here they come boardís broke through a tackle pulling us down the sidelines if he could have kept his balance and not got out of bounds there was nobody left Dexter Jackson saved the touchdown take a look at the strength of Clinton Portis here he comes up into the hole there's some quarrels and misses him I said at the beginning of this game you cannot tackle this guy with one guy or one arm if they don't make that stop there he's got touchdown and Santana Moss is outside throwing a block for and Portis may have hurt his left arm BET's comes back here and betts dives forward to the 24 they need to reach the 27 for a first down the clock running we've gone under four and a half minutes the Bucks have had the opportunity defensively twice to get there off in some decent field position can they do it one more time but can the Redskins come up with a big third down I've talked about playaction before for the Bucks I think this is a good opportunity for the Redskins to try it and find Chris Poole huge stirred down Brunell throws back across the field should have been taught by Taylor Jacobson instead it goes to flyin jelly I'm going to tell you what you have no idea what a great interception this is but you're going to see it and appreciate it Brunell is trying to make something happen and he's going to try to throw the ball back across the field into the middle but once when Kelly does up in the air with the ball it's a phenomenal head onehanded onehanded you'll see this he knocks it to himself and then makes the interception if you're any kind of a quarterback at any stage of any type of football the one thing you learn is you never throw the ball back into the middle of the defense it comes down to this with 344 to go the Bucs need a touchdown to tie nothing less course if they get the touchdown with john bruton go for toe only no penalty no I'm not on this game I wouldn't think so Cadillac Williams the deep man in the eye he'll get the carry picks up five and then thrown back from the 30 when Cadillac Williams walked into our meeting the other day I looked at him and I thought you know son you're too small to play when he I mean he can unload when he gets into the hole and he knows he's going to get it look at he's have to have real big arms he's not real tall and look at him quarter by quarter and as he gets to the fourth quarter we're in he's averaging 5.7 yards a carry he's not too small man he's on Hamlet sins over the middle and incomplete they had Cadillac out in the past pattern in that time and he couldn't hang on my Kherson Prioleau was covering it like the other thing I really liked what Jon Gruden said about Cadillac Williams he said this offense needs an every down presence and he can be our every down Verizon's and he's proven it here today he's run really tough made a lot of guys miss punishing runner and like you said Paulie he runs 30 pounds heavier well I got Pittman in there now and you know the fake to Pittman and then throw to it wouldn't be a bad idea this is just missed his last four and here's where the Redskins like to bring the Blitz they changed the defense he didn't get the play off while that hurts a play outs then a third and five it'll be third and ten the play Club the play clock expired but you know what Mike it doesn't hurt you that bad because you're in for down territory anyway I'll grant it's not as desperate a situation if you had to kick it or try a field goal earlier in the game here you're going for it no matter what how many times does Greg Williams love the Blitz on third and long if you do that you're going to leave somebody one on one with Joey Galloway for 57 minutes of this football game you've managed to keep Joey under wraps you've got to try and do it if you're the Redskins for another three third and ten since deep texture email Shepard before we hit the ground are you kidding perfect throw a perfect throw English epic cookin captain incomplete are you kidding I would say what this young man threw a ball as well as anybody in the history of the National Football League this ball is perfect it is right on Shepherds in his hands you got to remember something now that I know the people are going to scream but that it applies in the end zone and the same as it does in the field when you're being tackled you come down with the ball you have to maintain control of the ball and he did not do that he loses possession even before his knee hits the ground right here now the ball starts squirting up in a way he does not have control of the ball when his elbow hits the ground it comes out Eagle Shepard had made only six catches all year long he has been forced into being the third wide receiver because Michael Clayton is out with a turf toe you think you're gonna throw to Galloway so Shepherd is the guy that gets deep and gets open and Simms hit him perfect in the first game almost the exact same spot on the field Chris Simms did exactly the same thing he threw him the football and he made the play he has one touchdown catch during the regular season it comes through it's the same in the end zone as it is in a playing field if he's being hit and he comes down he has to have control of the football he lost control of the ball and when you lose control of the ball areas he's coming down the ball is loose now and when he comes down he hits the ground the ball comes out it's an incomplete pass enough of Cairo how many times you look at it and when we if it is ruled incomplete it'll be fourth down and ten here's some more bad news for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers if they lose this challenge they lose their last time out so this is almost sets up a doordie fourth down we were hoping you'd come up with something good no but don't have anything like there it is you see the ball coming out folks Oh get that again let me just repeat it sits it in the end zone is the same as in the playing field outside the end zone you've got to have control of the ball when you come down doesn't he beat Carlos Rogers yes and the pass was perfect you'll see the ball start to squirt up he catches it now as he starts to bring it in the ball squirts up he does not have control right there when his knee hits the ground it looks like it but the other shot shows and then when it comes out and remember the call on the field is incomplete so they have to have overwhelming visual evidence to overturn it if they do lose this as Paul mentioned they lose the timeout they will have one way to stop the clock and that or Mike did excuse me I don't want to give it I don't want to give him that kind of crap they'll have one timeout left and that will be the twominute warning so if it is ruled that way they're gonna have to go for it and you keep going for gonna make you murdered are you man I the young Dale Shepherd looking for some help from above here I come the receiver in the process of making a catch or going to the ground independent of his knee getting if the ball comes loose upon contact to the ground by rule incomplete you know Mike not only is it a Paul but Mike Carey does as good a job as anybody that we have an opportunity to work with explaining a lie something happen that's an allpro explanation whether it went either way it went he's just so good at explaining what's happening now it's fourth down and ten here is the difference on what would happen if he if the receiver is not falling down if he would fall down coincidentally after the ket he could drop the wall but because he's going to the ground in the act of making the catch he must maintain possession even if he hits the ground and you also have done an excellent job explain thank you so much you actually like the referee I like I like him when they do a great job like Mike Carey fourth down they've got to have this play to stay alive sins are going to try the same thing incomplete on he had him open to Chris Sims had Edale Shepherd open again up the sidelines Wow holy mackerel I can't believe this he goes right over here you want to see him go right up the sideline and the Redskins don't really get over in coverage good protection there he is out and up and look at this look at the space if he could have hit him he'd had the second opportunity for another touchdown or an EDL Shepard was just hoping against hope that he would get another shot now the Redskins are going to run the football you think they are going to run the football there's no is Ashton the wizard may Conservation's every now and then to save it I know you come out what's tough it's hard to believe the Redskins can run most of the clock off they would have to kick it away with about 30 seconds left if they don't get a first down there is a fly it's it's going to be against the wall skids again coming up join now Michaels and John Madden to the second half of our wildcard Saturday doubleheader Tom Brady and the Patriots begin their quest for an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title as they take on the Jaguars next right here on ABC Sports home of Super Bowl 42 clock never know move on did life that didn't because it was a it was a legal motion by the by the Redskins not a place so that I thought I ever moved payment of it did they would have moved it back to 248 poorness is the running back hit him now get up right away get away from him there they have to move the book I have to spot the ball there are 11 Tampa Bay Buccaneer defenders within four yards of the line of scrimmage they have to run a play yeah there's a threesecond difference between the game clock and the play clock so they could take this down as far as they want and maybe call a timeout and then they're still going to have to run a play it doesn't matter I don't know what they're really waiting one because it Tampa Bay they cannot take any more timeouts they don't have any poorness what a defensive football game what a defensive football game they'll blow the play dead 159 is the official time of the twominute warning back to Tampa in a moment welcome back to Tampa nothing like playoff intensity we expected a dogfight and we've got the Redskins defense punish the Fox in the first half in his first playoff appearance pleaseth written board is touchdown defense workers Washington set up a touchdown a few days trying to get it done to open the second half I made it seven to ten both defenses at bengurion Suzie speaking defensive brilliance the Redskins in an offensive funk they gained only 116 yards in this game if they win that will be the worst offensive production in NFL playoff history third the long here Portis waits it out to the forty the Redskins will end the clock run what Clinton Portis wanted to do was gain as many yards as he could so when you punt the ball you want to take that buck offense back as far as possible and this is what Jon Gruden is doing he is putting Joey Galloway back to return the kick I would almost think about kicking his puppy somewhere out of bounds around the 30yard line I don't care where you put it out of bounds just get it away from Joey Galloway the Redskins can take it down to about 112 before they snap the ball and it looks like they're going to use the timeout when they get it down as far as they can I mean this is just this has been an unbelievable battle I mean of which Jon Gruden deciding to go for it on fourth down knowing his defense is playing the way they're playing it right here letting the clock run down to a second using as much of it as you can as the Redskins it's been not only a very physical contest but it's been a great chess match between coaches Joe Gibbs not wanting to make the critical mistakes and that's been the difference in his football game the Redskins defense creates opportunities the Bucks have had two of them on the ground couldn't get him it was 36 35 the first time these teams met we talked about this a couple of days ago no way it was going to be 36 35 again these two defenses were gonna come to play today and they have done it they have both been brilliant the Ravens hold the record for offensive futility by a winning team against the Titans back in 2001 but the Redskins at 12 yards below that Frost hey horrible pun he kept it away from Joey Galloway no no I meant out of bounds down the field not at the 46 yard line a 14 yard clunker yikes no timeouts very little clock time taken I think that if you're you know if you're Jon Gruden you're gonna have to put the ball down the field further than three or four yard completions because if they are caught the clocks going to continue to run if you're the Redskins don't get beat deep well they just saved you 30 yards well and one thing you have time to throw one pass over the middle which the middle is wide open and it will be it's been open all night long throw one in the middle they like to throw to Alex Smith in there threeman rush that is the fifth pass that the defensive line of the Washington Redskins has got their hands on today and how appropriate that a defensive play would end this game Marcus Washington if you were going to pick an MVP of this football team defensively Marcus Washington has been the one every time a big play has had to have been made he has done it there it is again unbelievable he gets it tipped again he's had five of them Cornelius Griffin Cornelius Griffin three AAS Griffin tipped the ball talked about two guys didn't play the last time Sean Taylor Cornelius Griffith Sean Taylor hasn't played much of the second half because he's getting dressed to go home but he made the big play in the first half the Bucks do not have the time out all the Redskins have to do is take a knee and they are shocked here in Tampa the Redskins passed for 25 yards tonight the worst they have ever done in a postseason game Mike they had 122 they're down to 121 they're going the other doesn't matter yeah no it doesn't matter they're setting a record for the lowest amount of yardage in a game I'm gonna I don't matter I want to make a specific the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with Chris Simms this defense this football team as young as they are Jon Gruden has done his best coaching job as has Joe Gibbs the Bucs will be back that is six in a row for Joe Gibbs in the Washington Redskins they have basically been in a playoff mode for a month and a half the final score the Redskins 17 the Bucs 10 won't be back to tempo after this back in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida the Redskins have beaten Tampa Bay 17 to tend to stay alive in the playoffs let's check in with Susan well Mike it took six years but Lavar Arrington finally got to the playoffs what was it like you know I don't even know if it's sunk in yet this is this is unbelievable just just to be in the playoffs and then to come and win in such a great arena I mean it's early first quarter you set the tone the interception what are you thinking as you see that ball coming towards him watch he threw it so don't drop it we're gonna play out though don't mess this one up so I've got it tried to mess it out but we kept the ball how long do you wait until you start thinking about Seattle this is new for me I don't know whatever the coach is let me do my man thanks mark yeah you always got to stop the final score Redskins 1710 over the Bucs for Joe Theismann Paul McGuire Suzy Kolber and our entire ABC crew this is Mike Patrick now let's go to Chris Berman in New York for the Diet Pepsi wildcard between game show
