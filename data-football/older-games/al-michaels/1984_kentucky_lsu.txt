Munt minutes to play South Carolina leading Notre Dame 3632 everyone will focus on the implications for Jerry pout but if the Gamecocks win a better story is Joe Morrison and South Carolina of victory would make them the first South Carolina team ever to win six games in a row Arkansas at number three Texas the Longhorns lead 14 3 at halftime Ohio State at Michigan State the Spartans has slowed Keith Byars for the second consecutive year and they've got a shot 1612 in the fourth quarter Miami has beaten Pittsburgh 27 to 7 Kosar was doubtful and passed for 351 yards Syracuse at Penn State Penn State is playing without strength but John Schafer's doing a good job at quarterback the Lions lead 21 nothing in the third Georgia Tech at Auburn Auburn leading 31 nothing they get better and better after those two opening defeats Galen Hall still unbeaten as a head coach as Florida on top of Cincinnati 38 to nine in the third quarter van de volta Georgia it was tied 2121 in the second quarter georgia scored 38 consecutive points this is the most they've scored since a game against the Citadel 26 years ago Alabama Tennessee Ray Perkins wouldn't answer questions from reporters after

tied up 1010 at halftime Kansas at Oklahoma State Cowboys still lead the nation in interceptions and they lead 28 three in the second quarter again the interceptors are at work today Missouri at

creators of video technology that excites the senses by Ryder truck is right or it's wrong and by Owens Corning our building product put your house in the face keep your month of installation can lab you blender on your bill fight back with the attic blanket from owens corning it's the biggest most powerful role of thermal protection you can have they could help you save money on your people in college football are still talking about the controversy which surrounded the nexttolast play and last Saturday standoff between number one Texas and number two Oklahoma you'll remember the situation Texas trailing by three ball on the oklahoma 15 pass thrown by Todd dodge intended for Bill Boyd blind deflected by number six in the red Andre Johnson into the arms of number 19 each standard he'll judge which parts of the big April fan berry did not make an interception pass incomplete next play Texas Jeff would kick the gametying field goal as time ran out long horn folks Fred Akers was properly ecstatic with the turn of events Oklahoma folks Barry Switzer railed at the strike shirt for this and two other questionable falls in Texas closing drive later charging officials had robbed this team of victory ABC Sports replay take him from the angle lateral to that of the two officials on the scene clearly showed East and Barry had possession of the football and was inbounds well I 50 the first official uh did I kiss the ball he said first Christmas to know you to kiss the ball any second official suggests he caught the ball and I asked the first ten makes its first official me Danny said I caught the ball of the balance and I always started to the point of what its decision which asked the right four times and he wouldn't say anything it's go ahead and play ball on Monday big eight supervisor of officials Bruce Finlayson conceded the incorrect call had been made on the question of whether Stanbury had caught the ball in bounds but pointed out field judge butch Clark and followed a conference guideline requiring him to be 100% certain of legal possession in the endzone before making such a call Finlayson told us on the phone he would be more comfortable if a foolproof system of electronic replay could be devised to eliminate doubt in such situations here now three significant opinions on that ageold question Barry Switzer Southwest Conference Commissioner Fred Jacobi NCAA rules committee secretary Dave Nelson this has always been a problem in ball games throughout the country ever since the game has been played and will continue to be until we use some type of electrical media the instant replay and deans of any game this televised not just ones of national importance if you would really use like funny device I've heard it said you need upwards of 14 cameras to get all the angles you would need and in from my standpoint that would be unacceptable and obviously the cost would be prohibitive could you stop the football game they decide to look something for other reason or however we do this and that's another thing you'd have to decide how this is going to be done and then you find the things increases what do you do then do you play the play over do you get into the same situation you have an inadvertent whistle or you have to go with the original decision maybe there wasn't an original decision what do you do then another question the Oklahoma Texas contract calls for six officials three each from the big eight and the Southwest Conference what's the big eight like the pac10 and the Big Ten assigns seven officials to its conference games on this Oklahoma game film X will mark the spot where the seventh official had there been one would have been stationed at the beginning of the play in question as the play developed he would have gravitated toward the side of the endzone toward which the ball was thrown his view would have been identical to the one provided by this ABC replay a clear look at Stan Berry's catch of the ball with both feet inbounds again Fred Jacobi of the Southwest Conference Barry Switzer on the subject of the seventh official our conference position is that we want to see how it's going to work nationwide first and you have the factors of cost and consistency obviously with seven official year your officiating costs are gonna escalate quite highly as far as consistency every time you had another official you had a factor that could result in the infant system single I think if we had had the seventh official there's where he is lined up physically on the field and his mechanics he would have seen the ball caught because he would have been right the goalposts he wouldn't been on the side of the field is this official both officials are out of position and the seventh official we've been looking right directly into the receiver of the ball a final reflection from me the more I watched the play the more I suspect Andre Johnson could have been called for interference contacting Bryant as he knocks the ball over to keep Stanbury and now you know cook your comments on the entire situation well it's obvious of Jim when you have a split crew you're saying somebody's partial and that's how split crews started you have neutral fischels and all the ballgames except the Rose Bowl so you can have a split crew as for the cost of having a seventh official those fans are paying 20 bucks a ticket I don't know what an extra couple thousand dollars is it's ridiculous have the seventh official if the reason isn't money that it's because I agree with you all right at South Bend incidentally they are now in the closing minute a South Carolina interception has given the Gamecocks a potential chance to run out the clock they appear headed for victory we'll be taking you out to the game in your region immediately after this it was moving day these were going great what would you call a video recorder that has everything I'm smart it's a Zenith VHS with extraordinary

often installs in no time lasts a long time and by the NCR personal computer of business computer that's everything you'd expect from NCR whether is outstanding as you look at the LSU fighting Tigers as they come out onto the playing surface at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington Kentucky campus of the University of Kentucky they are oneonone in the conference a tie with Florida a win last week over Vanderbilt so they had to hang on a lake Vandy charged falling seven points I and the Tigers are 400 and one under Bell on swagger and there are the blue and white glass last week a victory against Mississippi State 17 to 13 to open their SEC schedule and their overall mark is climb at all and that's the best start for a Kentucky team since 1950 and 34 years ago when the Wildcats were five and all their coach would Paul Bear Bryant we've got a good one for you today welcome to Lexington everybody i'm al michaels a couple of resurgent team the kentucky wildcats in their third year under Jerry Claiborne he had good success at Virginia Tech and also at Maryland but in his first season here in 1982 the team was old team and one who rebounded last year to win six go to the Hall of Fame ball and now they're looking for a conference championship and right now they though they begin the very tough part of their schedule also a resurgent team for Baton Rouge the LSU fighting Tigers Jerry Stovall rolled a close to career there for four years he was let go and Bill arns Parker the defensive genius of the Miami Dolphins former New York Giants head coach took over and he is unbeaten right now as the season approaches the halfway mark for oh and one a good one today two unbeatens meeting head on in lexington kentucky league rosca begins his 17th season as an ABC college football color analyst great to see again lien today we've got a terrific matchup on the ground beast you've got the country's fourth ranked rusher and all familiar develop and number six George Adams of Kentucky carry the ball well I think this is one of the most compelling and matchup of running backs that we're gonna see and they Southeast Conference this year Dalton Hilliard only a junior already closing in on some of the career rushing records for LSU he's a good fundamental runner but what I like about him al is that he really has breakaway capabilities because of his speed and his nifty Necedah miss counterpart is one of the premier allpurpose backs in the country he ranks nationally in that category he has the size that you like a good hand good speed heat to as the breakaway capabilities that you like both teams have good runners and good rushing defenses so if those things balance out what about the quarterback now order backs the Jeff Wickersham for LSU is probably the strongest armed quarterback the of Hansen Burt Joe was here back in the early 70s he throws all types of passes he's basically rewriting the press guide for the Tigers he is probably best throwing the deep middle pattern his counterpart Phil Ramsdell number nine for them is the best sophomore quarterback in America in terms of passing efficiency his father is a former Kentucky quarterback so he literally grew up throwing the football he has strong leadership capabilities for such a youngster briefly Tigers favored by about a field goal do you agree with that assessment I think they should be favored based on their talent they have more talent but attitude and emotions play such an important part in college football Kentucky has been going for them right now town is excited so is the whole state or in Lexington full house to look on on a beautiful day Commonwealth Stadium it's the Tigers and Wildcats coming right up cool Colts not a Japanese car sure the doors are good look at the fit your hands what a deal I got cold imported for Dodge and Plymouth those by Mitsubishi in Japan let's take a spin first take your shoes off what isn't this car called something Japanese coat it's all

plus this garage door opener just 1:48 our lowest of the years on sale now for two days only series record a big advantage for LSU 24 nine and one last year however in Baton Rouge Kentucky went down to Tiger Stadium and ruined Homecoming winning 21 to 30 so to rebounding teams as you look at the men back deep Sam Martin is 23 Hermann Fontenot 40 for the Tigers and Jill Worley who has won the place kicking duties for Kentucky overtaking Jim Ryder last week gets the kick off from the near hash mark and it comes down in Martin's direction at the oneyard line and the freshman comes out past the pan and after the 25yard line Tigers start from there we talked about Jeff Wickersham he comes out of Merritt Island Florida and then Dalton fuller just a junior with Craig Raskin starting at the other running back spot Gary James is first Furman Clopton old one wideout and Eric Martin the allamerica candidate is the other Fontenot and Martin bulky to LSU as running backs Gary James broke the bone in his hand and is suited up for the game as Wickersham goes ranks of the air and strikes with a screen that followed them and caught by Hilliard who takes it out to the 31yard line gain of five up front the tight end is Mitch Andrews number 83 the offensive lineman John Harrell is 65 and 250 pounds Kirk Gore 6 4 and 255 Tommy Campbell 63 and 242 Kevin Langford out of Florence Mississippi as a senior 6 1 to 60 their best offensive lineman is Lance Smith and of Kannapolis North Carolina 6 2 + 273 draw play Hillier has a big hole and exploit it for a scene yard gain and a first down to the 40 yard line where David Thompson number 92 makes this tackle now up front for Kentucky 6 May in front Monza dumb ball hair Thompson Reese and Williams then the Packers are Kramer and Jacob and The Bachelor and they're hurting their Hairston Jackson and Calhoun is the key man safety intercepted two passes last week and is a hunter Hilliard takes detection gets it after the 44 yard line a gain of close to four it'll be second and six the stop is made by 38 Steve Mozza the number is right there for Dalton Hilliard who broke in spectacularly as a freshman in 1980 to set an NCAA mark that year was 16 touchdowns a freshman record he's been bothered by injuries but still he's on a face right now have it and we put in at or near the top of the alltime leading rushers in LSU history number one would be Charles Alexander it was Martin so it will be third down coming up what about the effect Lee of Gary James not being in the offensive alignment for LSU what will it mean it's going to take away some speed because he's the fastest man on the squad with four three speed in the 40yard dash also he's very effective as a receiver both as an intermediate and deep track all split with Magee the freshman now in the slide who makes the catch at the 34yard line the allamerica candidates stop by Russell Hairston Eric Martin having a good year though he has not scored a touchdown yet in 1984 I mentioned the strong arm of wickersham at the top of the show and how well he sets up in the pocket look at the delivery right there Eric Martin number 41 running a sideline cut gets in front of Russell Hairston number six and that ball was thrown perfectly and with great authority two of three in the passing department now for wickersham for 30 yards to the 25yard line pretty balanced attack all things considered for LSU where Kentucky would be more run oriented but LSU has Hilliard they do not as we mentioned have James today but excellent receivers and wickersham maybe a bit underrated as a quarterback as he bears down on certain career mark cell by Alan Risher he has already surpassed burr Jones in several career categories second down and four LSU at the Kentucky 25yard line for taking the pitch out and picks up just about a yard rustle Hairston number six in on the tackle along with 27 Maurice Douglas 12 amplify on what you just said Wickersham and his current pace will ultimately be the career passing leaders he's rewriting the press guide right now and he's probably as strong as any quarterback they've had in a long time that goes back to Burke Jones in the early 70s they're down in three they're going into a slight breeze at the moment as well so a field goal situation with the ball right now to be spotted at the 24 yard line and that would mean a kick of 41 yards in as we say a slight breeze I would estimate it between 8 to 10 miles per hour 1 baton Jose born and raised in Mexico City went to boarding school in Mississippi and recruited there by the Tigers 9 of 13 this year in field goal attempts and an angle a 41 yard attempt the kick is a folding kick that but appears to be a promising start on that drive but nothing to show for it as the Wildcats take over in the first quarter how about you and kids up to your scoreless sat down with lumps out the dead can't get it together makes you feel sad you know you can do it you wonder where if you want assume that you really care the services can help you so you not only get better you really grow talking Army Navy Air Force Marines they'll take the train show you the way you work hard to get decent pay if the army the airforce Molina's proved he can make it prove it all certainty graduate and walk ins all in the Army Navy Air Force Marines you've got it together they'll see the glam thanks to the services you got the chance in the Army Navy Air Force Marines it's a great place to start mr. Goodwrench you know what starts when your engine starts engine where 100 strokes 200 distant strokes of where per second hopefully a fine lubricant can protect it introducing new GM Goodwrench motor oil the motor oil from General Motors that meets or exceeds all GM specifications protective for me mr. Goodwrench the Wildcats have asked for their opponents in every quarter this season have not been scored on in the first period while they is 427 they have held LSU Tigers missing a field goal attempt and the Wildcats now take over their first offensive play from their own 24 yard line Brees at their backs and it's Adams on the picks finding no room at all and a swarming tackle made at the 25yard line led by Carl Wilson offensively Ramsdale whose father was a quarterback here years back Adams could very well be a firstround pick Derry has only carried the ball four times this year looking for him more today Joe Phillips is their leading receiver and Eric Pitts splits to the other side it is second down and ten Ramsdale the 12th ranked in the nation when you use the formula even though Venus nor the Bulge is 97 times give it to Adams again to the other side and he's able to burrow his way out to the 30 I'd line Oliver Wight is a goodlooking tight end number 87 he could be very instrumental in their planned at a shirt left the left tackle prints out of Mayfield of 269 pounds Petrovic is the center to 31 there Monte Dawson 62 to 51 Tom Richey is getting the start over the injured Verne Johnson that tackle he's to 52 third down call it six from the 29 yard line is low and incomplete intended for Jill Phillips number eight France tell is not particularly mobile normally does a pretty good job staying in the pocket that time he had to step up but the throw is low and so Kentucky can I pick up a first down and they'll have to fun conditions are very good a little bit of rain this morning not much so and it's overcast and conceivably we could have a shower before this one is done but very comfortable Calhoun to kick with Norman Jefferson back deep for LSU standing at the 25 Calhoun on eight kicks last week average 50 yards a tick this is a line drive Tech fielded at the 29 yard line by Jefferson and he comes back to the 39 so the Tigers get it for the second time right there 10:30 to go in the period nothing nothing in Lexington what makes peerless American number one doityourself wash Alice faucet it goes in fasted no teams to use you're just fearless wash Alice Fawcett installs in no time peerless installs in no time that's a long time you can always pick the Serta Perfect Sleeper sleeper jeez the water's awake she slept great on assertive Perfect Sleeper mattress you see only Serta has the Tola suspension system a new dimension of total support and comfort so make a healthy investment in yourself via Serta Perfect Sleeper sleeper and now during the national furniture sale and sweepstakes get our Serta Perfect Sleeper on sale at all participating stores bill Arne swagger coached the New York Giants in the mid 70s for two and a half years renowned as the defense of genius under Don Shula now in his first season as a major college head coach watching his LSU Tigers on first and ten feels intended for Martin who is able to make the catch it looked like Martin was going to haven't wrestled away meanwhile that is a very dispiriting same as wickersham reaches for his right leg the quarterback and a man LSU can ill afford to lose his back up to his Doug powers so he's able to hit Martin over the middle near midfield but let's wait to see about wickersham and as we told you they have already lost one of their key components in Gary James who is here suited up yesterday but broke a bone in his hand has his hand in a cast and did not suit up for the warmups before the game watch Wickersham get hit here now wickersham straight drop back action looks to his left moves forward in the pocket right here and is going to be looking over the middle for Eric Parton number 41 he is hit on the blind side and then sandwich it both in the backend in the front hit originally by Greg chuckle number 86 it looks like he's injured his right knee well it's the first down but it may be a very constantly one is Doug Powell takes over from the 48 yard line and gives the ball the hillier he takes it to the Kentucky 47 yard line doesn't howl like Wickersham is a junior however he has relatively little playing experience what is known about him is that he is a big strong arm throw as yet he could not be classified as a passer because he really doesn't have that that touch yet and he doesn't have the playing experience but he does have a big strong arm and Wickersham now comes back in so 4w if the Tigers not serious at all and he goes right to the air on 2nd and 5 get some nice protection and then the past is thrown away from RAF gens reach able to get a hand on it and that's all and it will be third down the wickersham now 3 of 6 in the passing department 440 yards Jerry Claybourne the head coach at Kentucky 10 years at Virginia Tech had some good years there 10 years at Maryland and some 5 seasons in the ACC there but then he came home he's a graduate of Kentucky opened to refrain cursing in the in its third season Wickersham looking for the first totally fourthdown Eric was there bacillus Maurice Douglas and a penalty marker is down there is a flag at the 36 yard line Martin the white out on the right is going to be matched up with Maurice Douglas number 27 he rounds his square out in college football one foot must be in bound for it to be a completion referee today is dick Burleson Pete Williams Bobby towns Ronnie Bane's Joe Delaney dick face and Ted Thomas are the other officials and it's a major penalty marched off against LSU let's get the call from Burleson dead ball foul personal foul over here so it's a dead ball foul I like that that ball foul over here what it means is that the play counts which is good for Kentucky and then it's doubly good at the second if the penalty is been assessed so it's fourth down and clay Parker 15:38 six to do the puppet hunting into the wind Brian Williams oddly enough he's a defensive aims for Kentucky but he runs five decks gloating take the pains in the wind from the 15yard it's William rolling it back out to about the 80 yard line 47 yards but good kick into the wind here so both teams trying to get established offensively with nine minutes and 11 seconds to play first quarter at the end of the rainbow for the Southeastern Conference champion automatic berth in the Sugar Bowl that's what these teams are looking for though there are other bull Scouts here as well looking on as both clubs come in unbeaten the only two unbeaten teams in the Southeastern Conference halfway through the season first down Wildcats at the 19 yard line they do a lot of shifting and maneuvering draw a play penalty marker for a negligible gain Ricky Chapman made the tackle number 37 and the marker is down illegal procedure Kentucky has been penalized quite a bit ago procedure offense by the Wildcats it's sort of on a team that is undefeated has been penalized 45 times in five games that's nine penalties again which is a considerable number partially I think because of what they're doing differently on offense all of the maneuvering and the motion we've been seeing the fastest incomplete on the far side intended for Erik pitch Jim Bergamo is working with us today and he's in the stands right now Jim all right thanks a lot al as you can see we're right here in the middle of the Kentucky faithful and believe me these fans are reveling in the Wildcats 5a no start they'll by the criticism that they'd not play okay I'm going to agree with them I'm going to say that a breed of cat is gonna win this game how's that for going out of the limit the penalty marker down is Cornell Burbank number four makes the catch it's enough for a first down Greg do Brock the linebacker 44 covered but let's see about the marker there's Hobley number 29 allamerica candidated safety for LSU listening in on the conversation ineligible receiver downfield is the signal from Burleson and so again Kentucky able to survive that a rash of penalties throughout the season they're five and all at this point in his Jim mentioned the only criticism Kentucky has received this year from those who feel at their schedule down fourth down and while their schedule lead may have been soft at this point as you look at their offense 15th in the country their schedule right now according to the NCAA for the balance of the season is the third toughest in division 1a starting now beginning at this point in next week they've got Georgia right here as if to emphasize that point so it's fourth down after the penalty and Calhoun to kick again winded his back and this one is a beauty Jefferson takes it at the 35yard line and set up for him and down he goes another penalty marker at the 44 yard line after a 50 yard check 8:30 to play in the first period at Lexington now that I've shown you all my other personal computers is something I just can't wait either sink oh joy oh I just love surprising people okay come on over here Oh see I'm making the personal computers uhhuh nice graphics easy to read surprise not particularly I'll take it Oh what about this for sturdy well that's sturdy but then I wasn't expecting flimsy not from NPR boys have a little surprise I may be startled but just a letter never too late it could you look surprised I said I'd take it I know I know you'll check it I just wanted to do but I know NCR they practically computerized the banking business book I'm writing the check Oh money isn't everything what about young actors well have you ever considered another line of work you like to surprise people you could be a magician you can't make a living pulling rabbits out of a hat I got four daughters in dental school for surprise yeah a better computer it's exactly what you'd expect from NCR tomorrow night in an NFL special but seats title the Cowboys super matchups only on BB easy on the return by Jefferson watch for the clip Shawn Brooke clips cam Jacob number 48 there you see it right there pretty obvious infraction and that was the reason for the marker it has been assessed against LSU that puts them back of a 25yard line both teams have now punted a couple of times at LSU strikes this drive from the 25yard line in a scoreless first quarter as Hilliard takes it out to the 28 yard line a gain of three let's check in with Jim Lampley all right Allen let's look at three finals very quickly South Carolina beat Notre Dame 3632 first Gamecock team ever to win six in a row Ohio State held off Michigan State 23 to 20 mozi ink Oh missed a gametying field goal with three seconds to play Byers 40 carries on in 21 yards Iowa shutout struggling Michigan 26 nothing back to you all right damn it Dalton Hilliard has just carried the ball out past the 40 to the 42 yard line but we have yet another penalty marker another flag thrown on the play as Hilliard moved it out for what would be a first down if the penalty is assessed against Kentucky so dick Paulson and his crew have already been busy it is a facemask all indeed against the Wildcats already the third time they've been penalized in the game so they'll take it from the 43 and move it out to the 48 yard line after the assessment and facemask fiveyard penalty defense first down Hilliard has done all of the ball carrying thus far for LSU seven carries 43 yards peace though takes it inside the Kentucky 40 to the 38 yard line garland jeanbaptiste is a sophomore who carried the ball at one time last year and he gained 58 yards on that carry in his freshman season and he figures to see more action today in the absence of James and his first carry that's a first down as to get it to the 39 yard line first and 10 Hilliard is back in on a counter play to the short side of the field Kentucky you can see they thought they had recovered the ball but obviously through the gyrations you number 74 Williams you can tell if the whistle had blown Hilliard on a counter or misdirection move that time made a jab step to his right then came back to the weak side or left side lost the ball momentarily but apparently they ruled it the for LSU it's Jon batiste again close to a first down that's his last name Jon batiste first name garland six feet even to twenty sophomore out of st. martinville Louisiana time out for a measurement here this year he's averaging four point four yards a carry ball of the 29 yard line is the Bengal tigers have moved from their own 25 Italy to be third down in an inch or so or a first down and it is the latter the Lawrence Parker he was offered reportedly a million dollars over a fouryear period to remain at Miami is Don Shula's defensive gurus a pretty good salary for an assistant coach will elected to come due back Roos come there with his friend the what a director Bob brought head who'd worked with him to the 23 yard line pickup of close to five call it six Bozza and dumb ball making the stop tough manda to bring down here don't hill you well as we said at the top of the show he's a good nuts and bolts runner good running the fall tackle the cycle but he also has that breakaway speed four five four four in the 40yard dash good hands can make the overtheshoulder catch so he's a good allpurpose back for them right now he's the ace back or long back second and four Meister's way close to the 18 yard line brought down that time by dum Baldwin Wilkins number 74 and he's now carried for world sixty yards in the first quarter alone came in fourth in the nation in rushing off to a great start one thing about it the way they're using him now gives him a lot more flexibility when we covered him two years ago as a freshman under Jerry Stovall he was mostly in high back now they moving bôla' around to a lot of different position LSU has seven first downs and Kentucky does not have one on first down Blaine Herman Fontenot is taking a look as the quarterback wickersham unloads in a hurry and that's the type of play that if it doesn't wind up in your man's hands you're looking at six the other way maybe i think this is one of their automatic signals because wickersham just rises up he sees this there's a little seam there for Fontenot as he goes right upfield however the ball was thrown behind him instead of just to his forward shoulder Wickersham now three of eight in the passing department for 40 yards but wrapped in and Aslaksen Fontenot in motion perfectly and Hilliard was stopped dead before he ever had a chance to accelerate and a loss of six on the play big defensive play by number two William these Inns in they wide plateau six I really stand up and Brian Williams who also returned research funders very quick look how fast he's into the defensive secondary and he shuts off Dalton Hilliard before he can turn the corner the opposite monitor really did its job but so did the defensive backfield event he reached the time finally I thought he was open Eric Martin number 41 the career reception leader for LSU thought he was open on a corner pattern momentarily he had beaten Tony Hayes number three and had that ball been thrown over his outside shoulder you could have seen a touchdown Padma Times us this is a 43 yard attempt from the 33 good so these are sarcomere with 407 remaining to be played in the first quarter at Lexington its LSU drawing first blood as the Tigers go on with all their spaceage technology

it's all the Japanese you need to know sorry next Saturday on the CFA college football number three ranked Texan takes on number six SMU or the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame battle by Frank LSU next Saturday on ABC Lexington Kentucky is the site Al Michaels with Lee cross cup man Jim Bergamo at Commonwealth Stadium 55,000 filling Commonwealth Stadium as the Kentucky Wildcats have gotten off to their best start since 1950 Paul Bear Bryant the coach at that point now it's Jerry Claybourne in his third season two unbeaten teams meeting here today and LSU kicking off on top by a score of three nothing that's nice too Frank one yard line pounds at the oneyard line and obviously Kentucky will have them tick it again because your other option is to take the ball again shockingly about the schedule for Kentucky it's been pretty easy to this point Kent State Indiana Tulane Rutgers and Mississippi State but now you've got LSU Georgia North Texas State Vanderbilt Florida and Tennessee all upcoming however when you look at that schedule five of those games each game outside of the game with Tennessee is right here big advantage for them so despite the toughness of the schedule they do off the home field advantage and that is significant in this Stadium Matt the Frank ticking off began aside from a 35yard line Logan in the five very nearly broken everybody rising to their feet at Commonwealth Stadium for a moment it looked like if he could get by that one last man he might go all the way when Logan is tripped up and Kentucky will strike from the 32 yard line first and ten Mark Levine is there burner fastest man on the team with four three four four speed in the 40yard dash so he's a he's a threat anytime he gets his hands on the football either as a return man or when he turns the corner from his I back spot 29 yeah I run back for him it's first and ten for the Wildcats who are seeking their initial first down from the 33 yard line 401 to play first quarter LSU leading three nothing and time is called the first of the game by Bill Ramsdell as he looked over the defensive alignment didn't like what he called and he calls timeout timeout captain let's check in with Jim in New York all right let's give you a note on Georgia's victory over Vanderbilt AL final score 62 to 35 in the game Kevin Butler of Georgia kicks a field goal to make it 62 35 at the end the reason that been duly allowed him to kick a field goal in that situation is that the field goal snapped a tie with Herschel Walker for Butler and made him the alltime leading scorer in the Southeastern Conference most points for Georgia since they scored 76 against the Citadel 26 years ago back to you al all right Jim and Georgia coming in here next week with Kentucky not thinking about that right now they're thinking about LSU and remaining unbeaten last year Kentucky wound up going to a bowl games they lost their to West Virginia but it was quite a comeback for a team that the year fryer had not won a game they were old ten and one and played Warren's first season so it's first down from the 33 yard line or an still we'll put it up under some pressure the pocket breaks down and he is sacked at the 32 yard line it's Carl Wilson number 72 the best of the three men who normally lineup as the down lineman for LSU sophomore out of Baton Rouge down linemen really are kind of nondescript linebacking is sought to be the key to the defense for LSU but Carl Wilson as you mentioned has been the best of the front three he recovered a fumble in their game against USC it's been LSU's biggest win thus far this season in terms of national recognition la thanks it back to the 34 yard line number 33 George Adams born in Lexington raised in Lexington went to high school about a mile and a half from here has always lived in the neighborhood so there was never any question as to where he would be going to school injured player is Joe Prince number 65 and local boy is making very good adams is sixth in the country in rushing and there's a tendency when you get into a town where everybody starts talking about all these draft choices and what the pro scouts think but most of those AIIMS Rogers said that Adams would go in the first round they think he and each important but what Carolina might feet of prime available running backs on the next draft number 87 right in his hands and drop it right there perfect pass uncharacteristic of number 87 Oliver what who is thought to be their most consistent receiver slight sprint to the left ear he sets up behind his guard the ball is thrown perfectly over the linebackers head curling in behind there it's Oliver White he loses his concentration the one thing you don't do is look up field before you pull the ball down it's good to read the label first Norman Jefferson back to receive at Paul Calhoun in his field that it's applied by Jefferson who probably should have let it go to the 15yard line he out kicked the coverage but he asked if the coverage by so much that the receiver had to make the catch going back toward the end zone and when that's happening I guess the best thing to do is to let it go GUI hunt for Calhoun crows really like him because he's a twoway player he's a good defensive back and he's an excellent runner and those are the games we're gonna have for you next week check your local listings Texas SMU and Notre Dame LSU they regional comcastic Creek with billiards getting it out to the 20yard line on first down it's now second down and five so because of that tremendous putt by Calhoun the Tigers start out with relatively poor field position Calhoun you mentioned a twoway player he runs occasionally from hunt formation he did last week and it led to their victory over Mississippi State 25 yards on a fake punt they give it to Hilliard again celebrating the recovery by another 56 right and the first big break of the game belongs to the Wildcats who are still looking for a berth down number 56 Frank hair is the man to watch here as Hilliard starts wide cuts back toward the middle hit there loses the ball and covered by Mike hair Mike pelota number 94 got the hit that's Adam carrying the ball down to the 16 yard line mulatto simply stripped it away from him and in hair 56 is the man who recovers it so Kentucky despite doing nothing offensively in the quarter trailing three nothing but an advantageous position here deep and LSU territory second down and seven at the 17 yard line riki chant in the linebacker number 37 recovering the ball at the 16 yard line so Kentucky with a golden chance and a missed opportunity and Brooks and Wilson lay the hit on Adams setting up the buffle Adams going with a sprint draw to his left side is gonna get hit hard by Wilson number 72 and Michael Brooks the great outside linebacker number 94 setting up the fumble recovery by number 37 Ricky Chapman so that's the kind of thing that drives coaches crazy when you get a break like that and then you give the ball back turned it right back to him shot but cheese takes the ball out to the 19 yard line for a gain of three as the clock winds down 117 remaining in the first quarter that Lexington Kentucky if you're just tuning in yo actually the only two unbeaten teams in the Southeastern Conference LSU in Kentucky with the Tigers tossed three nothing the Tigers have been able to show plenty on here in the first quarter is wicker five Kentucky is right back in business again you have to believe that Kentucky knew something about the tendencies of LSU they like to throw to Martin along the sideline and number 27 Maurice Douglass's Nelson took a little risk there stepped in front of him wickersham has the last chance to knock him out he doesn't it's a touchdown for Kentucky and we have what we anticipated a real SEC shootout so the clock is running with 35 seconds now remaining to be played in the first quarter if they get down to the 1 or 2 a lot of times they'll give it to Adams and let him on dive over a lot of the stop made famous by Sam BAM Cunningham and more currently Herschel Walker who we saw do that two years ago but they are not in range for that at the moment is still out of the four yard line and they have shown nothing at all efficiently again somebody on the left side of the line I believe the left tackle jumped off I've been friends or shirt left who jumped across and that's gonna cost them five yards with 11 seconds remaining in the period suck it out so the cats continue to be totally nonproductive offensively frustrating for Jerry Claybourne whose offenses much more multiple this year than it has been in years past he's changed for the times the clock had started and that is the end of the first quarter so we'll bring it back the other way Kentucky will try the second quarter knocking on the door but after 15 minutes it's the Tigers on top three nothing Firestone drive over sale and save up a 30% on

years they can go anytime cheers and real No you're gonna want pores and get ready for excitement when korres is on the sea second period in Lexington Kentucky LSU leaves three nothing from the Wildcats habit at the 9 yard line on second down and goal and nothing doing for mark Logan as he is pushed back to the 11 and another penalty marker is draw so a run to the short side of the field as Kentucky has had a very difficult time moving the ball at all from any portion of the field against a very stubborn LSU defense in the last four games LSU has held the defense to 316 total yards on the ground and the preliminary indication another penalty against the Wildcats and this will be marched off from the nine all the way back to the 19 yard line 10yard penalty hold in offense repeat second down the line swagger 56 years old wait for Blanton Collier at Paris high school he's from nearby Paris his mother's at the game today a lot of friends and family from this area homecoming of sorts for a very nice gentleman on second go over the middle nearly intercepted no blue shirts in the area I guess the closest one would have been Joe Phillips but that was nearly intercepted by Lippert Hobley and Ramsdell is old before as you look at some first quarter numbers all waited to the left look at Kentucky's total yards here 11 total yards for the Wildcats in the first quarter despite that the defense has really dominated thought of Kentucky can be encouraged you have to be encouraged when you're getting blown out statistically like that again by three and year at the opposition to nineteen thirty go walking toward the end zone well by Kevin Guidry number 27 so what was first and goal at the five yard line is now fourth and goal at the 19 yard line and into the wind this is Joe Worley Jim Ryder had been doing the kicking but he incurred a groin pole they gave Worley a shot last week did the job and now it's his job to lose he's a freshman they had thought about redshirting him but then they needed him when Ryder got hurt this is a 37 yard account the second field goal of the season and we're tied early in the second quarter today it's not at all rare for drivers to keep their cars for ten years or longer it's also not at all rare for tenyearold BMWs to retain more than 90 percent of their original value which leads us to the BMW 318i one of the

can keep it forever if you keep this up back to you well the fortunes of coaches Perkins taken over for Brian two years ago having his troubles Johnny majors has had a roller coaster ride really Phil aren't Spargo everything's been beautiful for him so far in the forgery Claiborne after that Oh 10 in one season he's got his team unbeaten Worley doing the kicking off after he was perfect on his field goal attempt he has kicked two out of bounds and they'll move it back another five and set it up at the 30yard line Jerry Claiborne told us yesterday that he just felt on paper that LSU had more firepower that they're bigger they're stronger they're fast three says we're gonna need some breaks we're gonna have to establish our running game and we're gonna have to play the best game we have played all year this is a reaction of Worley right here as you see well that's it bang the back of your helmet put the ball back to the 30yard line freshmen as we said he's the fellow they were going to redshirt because Ryan tour had been doing a pretty good job for them gym rider but when Ryder got hurt Worley took over man here he is again attempting to kick off at the third time he's going to go the other way toward the other sideline this time from the 9 yard Terman pocket all and down at the 33yard line no like Martin you've mentioned before al was a running back when he was first recruited here so both of them have great open field capabilities after they catch the ball part no also throws the ball occasionally they were lateral it to it or pitch to him and then he will throw he did it last week to Martin for a 36yard touchdown at the Vanderbilt game marker yard line gain of five but we'll see again about the call here dick Burleson's crew doing the officiating and it's a holding call against the Tigers which will nullify the game by two all familiar again for those tuning in late Gary James broke a bone in his hand last week in the Vanderbilt game is here but is not suited up for the game so he will see no action early of the game Wickersham went down and a very anxious moment for holding the tiger backers in first down but it turned out to be just one play nothing major they've already had 10 penalties in the game that's the fourth against LSU in the first down billiards runs into his own man second and long and let's get a word from Jim Bergamo now what you're looking at right here is what LSU quarterback Jeff Wickersham and all the LSU quarterbacks where it's a series of plays for the majority of the fielder you flip it over and you've got eight more plays for the goal line it's not really a cheat sheet so much as it is a failsafe device if LSU has problems getting the play and they simply signal one through eight from the bench and that way LSU shouldn't come up short on what play to call going deep and just overthrowing I was out there and alone through it just by him he's got the breeze at his back it'll be third down at 18 wickersham we mentioned has a very strong arm and his best throwing from the pocket trying to throw the fly pattern to herman Fontenot number 40 who has a step on the corner back right there the ball should have been thrown with a little bit softer and more looping trajectory and it could have settled in over his outside shoulder sir down and 18 looking deep but double covered and overthrown Elena Holt duck against St covered by Jensen and maze and the crabbers funds through the Kentucky defense as they come off the field heavy force the punch Wickersham is now 3 of 11 and he's missed his last six in a row all right you've got clay Parker to kick and Brian Williams the defensive end who runs back puts standing at the 35 yard line Brees at conkers back overcast right now but now he's going to kick it away as he moves out of trouble and it's Williams dropping the ball then recovering it back in the 27 yard line good recovery by clay Parker I like the way when he said that he was in trouble he cut it on the run so far ko was rushed was able to move away and Kentucky has the ball when we come back what would you call as Xena that puts a 25inch picture in a 19 inch space that's capable of a hundred and seventy eight channels including cable and four continuous color balance a computer brain plus parental control that locks out channels you don't watch now that's the smart

Greta Vikes Plus fountains more the New York City Marathon live next Sunday on ABC because of the pressure applied up the middle by Frank here number 56 play Parker has to make an adjustment here he moves to his left he dances away from a tackler right there and then kicks semi on the move to his left which is quite an adjustment 44 yards on the punt now Kentucky has it from the 27 yard line Randall almost intercepted by Hobley intended for Mark wheeler who was in amongst the defensive backs with no room at all and all four sixes Ramsdell neither quarterbacks having a good day efficiency numbers of any sophomore quarterback in college football off to a very bad start today and Kentucky is still looking for that elusive first first down but the game is tied 33 due to a break on an interception they were able to get a field goal off the 39yard line stopped by Geoffrey Jo and so finally offensively the cats have given the fans something to cheer about mark Logan who backs up here in Lexington first first down for the cash at the 40yard line first and ten we'll just out of this formation as a matter of fact sometimes it can get so confusing you got guys coming into each other and a flag is saw that is something that is not uncommon this year for Kentucky to have them lineup and three or four or five men move and that time it looked like they were in a phone booth where you mentioned in the past that because of his belief in weight program file he legal procedure first down because of his belief in weight program Gary Claiborne in the past has been pretty basic he likes to dominate with a strong running game but because of the fact that he felt like he may have been a little short on talent it didn't have some of the big horses that he's had in the past that he would become more moldable first and 15 under pressure at the 40yard line by Sean Burke ball is loose and recovered by LSU at the 31 yard line it was Kevin Guidry alertly coming over to recover it so an interception and LSU is back in business in KY territory John Birks number 57 the leading tackler on the team played the game called look what I found right here as the ball comes right into his numbers he's looking for someone to lateral the ball to there loses it Kevin Guidry number 27 is there and available covers the football right there and once again the Tigers have excellent field position and also another penalty marker on the plate illegal forward pass so not only did he lateral it but he did it in a forward fashion and so back to the 40yard line after the call on his first half for LSU so a sloppily played game to this point tied 33 at the 40yard line first and ten for LA the slot on the left the fancy has time he flows to Fontenot and he is dragged down to the 25 yard line after a gain of 15 by Maurice Douglas who made the interception before good job of reading that time by wickersham and in the wide tackle six one of the things about this defense is that it will be anywhere from a 4 to an eight man line jacobs number 48 is the blitzing linebacker wise some pressure but wickersham stands tall moves to his right and then unloads on firsttime draw play Hilliard fumble might have been a guy who recovered it one day a file of any event it's Kentucky in a game of turnovers coming up with it Russell Hairston number six the defensive back come up with a ball after the puck was made by Kim Jacobs number 48 Hilliard on the cutback play is hit hard by number 48 linebacker cam Jacobs right there strips the ball and the van who covers it for Kentucky is Russell Hairston number six in the secondary now from the 22 it's back to the basics as Adams tries to get something started he's been bottled up moves to the 23 yard line one of the things Kentucky figured they would have to do would be to get the ball to somebody else beside a knows a fella who's not going to do the job for you but they felt that the other teams would start recognizing their tendency to go to him 80 to 90% of the time and one of the things they wanted to do is start to give it to people like fullback dairy they haven't yet go on second down they still go with Adams and he's able to the 30yard line where he is about two and a half yards shy of a first down after the tackle by Ricky Chapman 1105 to go in the head he saw a hit right there of why the pro scouts think he will go in the first round he has the size you like at 228 pounds good cutback ability excellent hand he actually runs pass drops like a receiver not like a running back he told us his idol was former running back Sonny Collins three yardline not even reaching the line of scrimmage Gorman Jefferson and Lippert Hopley both came up from the secondary indicating that they felt Kentucky would keep it on the ground and go to their main guy and they did Michael Brooks number 94 is one of the premier outside linebackers in the country out of the mold of Lawrence Taylor of North Carolina you see right there why pro scouts are literally drooling over him even though he's only a sophomore on fourth down it is Calhoun to punt into the breeze Jefferson his knee here's a good one and a fair can't just hold for I used to run that one back 55 yards 5 956 to go in the half 33 tie well moms and dads the world around give their kids same old sound gotta go to school be a big success they wouldn't settle

tomsy X next Saturday on CFA college football of the three ranked Texan takes on number six SMU or the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame battle night Frank LSU next Saturday on ABC it's been a penalty filled game early in the second period 33 tie as LSU starts from people their own territory and Hilliard moves the ball out to the 19 yard line a gain of three Jerry Reese and Jeff Kramer making the tackle nine minutes and 42 seconds remaining in the first half a 33 tie so far it's been a route for the zebras in terms of total yardage a lot of penalties have been called LSU has shown offensively they can move the ball in particular on the ground Kentucky's not moved at all Ward is Hilliard carries it for a gain of close to five and maybe more as he sneaks another couple of yards buying himself at the end and that might be enough for a first down he slithered and snaked his way through the pile not fast the 25 of the 27 and he does pick up a first now know you're taking a muchneeded breather you look at his numbers reflected right there 18 carries already for 71 yards he comes out and Jon batiste comes in at rinchan 13 in motion and Sajjad back east with the ball it hide at the 30yard line after he picks up three maybe four yards it'll be second down and call it seven with eight minutes and 52 seconds remaining in the first half Cramer amongst those in on the tackle that time what did you say his average was for 1983 58 yards the track well he carried the ball one time against rice Keene 58 yards and call it a year pretty tough go and you're backing up people I kill your two James but he's getting some recovery so this game featuring penalties and fumbles and missed opportunity and as Kentucky danced at the 42 of LSU what looks to be a great dinner here initially for LSU turns into a turnover and keep your eye on Paul Calhoun in the secondary because he's going to come up with a number another big play that's number 26 right there the punter who is also effective at on coverage hitting and recoveries Eric pitch number 83 first completion of the day for the quarterback bill Ramsdale this is more of the way we think of brands Bell throwing the ball wide receiver is Eric Pitts number 83 he just slides in behind the coverage it looks like he was running a curl and he saw he could stay back to the outside Rupert Mobley number 29 is the man who makes the hit first half into 25 Vaughn Adams before they are really keying on him mark Higgs the ball carrier that time Higgs the tailback is the man who carry that's the first carry for him today as he spells atoms at this point they were keying on him anyway they keying on a tailback spot because they know that Kentucky has not been inclined to give the ball to their full backs this year this is one of the things you're going to see more and more of as the game goes on Jerry Claybourne likes to keep fresh backs in the game you're gonna see more of Logan and more of bigs he's got added back in there right now years ago yard line for a gain of a couple final Wilson number 72 the defensive lineman making the tackle it will be third down and eight Adams told us yesterday when we had a chance to visit with him but that's his favorite way he likes the draw and he likes the sprint draw because then he has a little chance to pick his way the Wildcats upset LSU at that rude to the 40yard line the Oliver Wight the tight end who dropped one earlier that was right in his hand stop by Rajas number seven so the Wildcats who had guy the first period in a hand without a first down and that fixed up two and its first down at the 14 yard line Granville has found his rhythm now and Oliver white is his favorite target he's fall for a tight end in terms of his height but the pro scouts liked him because of the fact that he can block and he can catch the football they think he may be a you back or an hback that guy that goes in motion a lot now they have Haig's and Adam is both in the backfield as Adams blocks for an eternity and works his way to the 11yard line 44 Greg do Brock the linebacker making the tackle second down and seven for Kentucky at the LSU 11 yard line game tied 33 6:15 to go in the half Jerry Claiborne a proponent of positive thinking for years has passed out the book psychocybernetics to his incoming freshman talked to him yesterday said yep he'll order it through the bookstore he'll pass them out maxwell maltz is happy the author is adamant takes the ball to the 9 yard line it'll be third down and 5 it was a popular book several years ago not only amongst athletes but to the general public is a recall on the bestseller list for quite some time and it goes all the way back to the 60s I read it for the first time back then read it again in the early 70s it's one of the best selfhelp books I think that's ever been written Claiborne believe still passes it out and right now Kentucky's gonna take a timeout to go over and read a chapter I suppose it'll be 35 when we come back the game inside no one could ever you're going to fall away where you're going it's exceptionally smooth and Niccolo when you take one of these things up you've

spark plugs are engineered to give you up to 30,000 miles reliable performance never wait for trouble go with a seafaring spark plugs call 800 a seat up over a retailer near you third down and five from the nine yard line as Jones has come in to throw out of bounds at the 8 yard line by James Pierson number 25 he was trying to throw back to the quarterback bill Ramsdale number 9 that was Tim Jones not only is Jones a quarterback but would come into the game for the first time they gave him a new number he's been number 17 and they put 23 on him in an attempt to fake out LSU watch him here and then he hasn't picked off the pitch out is to the tailback don't normally a quarterback there were 17 and he's trying to throw the ball back to Bill Ramsdale but the ball is kicked off with perfect meanwhile spinning my incomplete is the quarterback Wickersham so it'll be second down so Lawrence Barger has it backfire uses Jones for the first time in the game changes the Jersey what that means of course is that if the defensive been looking at film they will get used to number seventeen being a quarterback and who would be number twentythree would be your initial inclination when he throws the ball but they didn't pull and fooled our spotter Kelly haze either major horse going deep over the middle incomplete so Kentucky comes back or rather LSU comes back with two straight passes first trying to hit the sideline screen they bring up the secondary and then they throw deep wickersham not having a good day 4 of 14 in the passing department now for 56 yards he has a lot of muscle but he's gotta lower his tights the defense to hold him rs.10 who takes it onto a 29 yard line well that's be very cool under pressure with everything happening around him he did not vacate the pocket was able to step up fine Rome hit ranch and get him out of trouble and it's a first down with 458 to go in the half one of the most effective moves we've seen Wickersham make all day he was very poised took his time stood tall in the pocket little little bit to his right scan the field found wrapped in that's a 21yard pickup the freshman speedster tries to beat Calhoun and finally gets knocked down at the 10yard line as he put a move on Calhoun go by Steve Madden racing all the way back to his defensive end position but there is Rajee McGee number 80 who made the catch it was McGee who makes the catch for LSU a freshman so caught a touchdown pass last week 36 yards against Vanderbilt that was his 13th reception of the scene and it goes to 60 yards it fills the crowd and its first down brought us.you at the 11 yard line Hilliard another flag he goes at the 10yard line 4:22 now to play in the first half so the fighting Tigers who were down to a third and 10 deep in their own territory to watts and police students from wickersham and they're in business at the kentucky well we'll have to wait and see what yard line it is because the preliminary call is holding against LSU and they will take the penalty which it'll be first down now first and ten from the 22 yard line that's right Jen going in motion give it the Hilliard whole foot closes rather quickly as he is thwarted at the 17 yard line and it'll be second down going back to the big play by Raji McGee that's what we mean when we say firepower Wickersham really has a plethora of receivers that he can go to second down 16 to go from the 18 yard line tell your it again works his way to the 10yard line does Dalton and so it'll be third down third and about eight for a first down intent to the touchdown as jerry recent brian williams make this time dean tied 33 it's been a mistake filled penalty filled game most of the offense from LSU but right now not a whole lot to show for it is there tied 33 again third innate Wickersham lofting it from the junior from Cincinnati Mazda and Douglas were covering on the play and wand batons Oh sleeves the fieldgoal unit onto the field Wickersham trying to throw a fade pattern to McGee know the geometry of this looks like a corner pattern only he fades to the outside as he's running a fly pattern and there you see the double coverage there by by Mazda right there and also Maurice Douglas number 37 well we've got another penalty you know you begin to wonder if you get so many penalties early on if the referees aren't victims of momentum after a while almost feeling incumbent to throw a flag I've seen it happen yeah you get into that pattern where you start throwing a lot of flags and you can't get out of it this time it's holding and this time it's against Kentucky well I totally agree with you and they said the thing about holding isn't it if you wanted to you could call holding on every play and we've had a ton of penalties in this first half against both teams defensive holding repeat to the house get dick Burleson is the referee as you look at Jerry Claybourne third down look like he was counting third down and three for the first down fake the reverse wickersham rolls out of the pocket and down he goes with the three and he is shy of the first down Jerry Reese and Brian Williams popping him and so you're gonna have fourth down coming up right now as the Tigers look over toward the bench two minutes and 40 seconds remaining and there seems to be some confusion as to what they want to do at this particular point and now they have elected to opt for batons OSes group clock is down to 15 seconds to get the playoff here as they line up for the field goal which is a little chip shot 20 yard attempt from the 10 yard line but Todd Zo's trying to kick his second of the day and a kick by one is good penalty's settling for the field goal but times us now with his 35th career field goal that's an LSU record and with 213 to play in the state university LSU is using 3d computeraided structural design a futuristic tool for architecture and aesthetic creations LSU stable isotope lab has capabilities to trace back ocean temperatures 3 billion years to make accurate predictions for the future with a knowledge of the past Alison's research the human hand using an exclusive xray interpretation method will allow surgeons to accurately explore unseen options before difficult surgery LSU the quest for quality 213 to play in the first half at lexington kentucky LSU on top six to three in a game that has not been an artistic delight very sloppy penalty filled first half as the kickoff 5 to Frank bounces into the end zone for a touchback so the Kentucky Wildcats 20yard line I guess when you look at Italy Kentucky can feel pretty good about things they've played a terrible offensive first half made a lot of mistakes and they're only down by three LSU's had numerous chances but they've squandered them and leading by only three here is Ransdell personally nearside intended for Joe Phillips it's incomplete in the second down well he were a three point underdog coming into today's game and as we said at the top of the show they've really on paper aren't in the ballpark with LSU in terms of their overall talent and firepower and so what they've got a hope for they're gonna hope for some breaks they want to establish the running game as much as they can and and freeze the football keep the ball away from LSU to keep that firepower off the field second and ten the flag to mark Logan hit hard at the 26yard line by Ricky Chapman number 37 so Ransdell says hurry up we're going without a huddle third down and four Kentucky was only one timeout left in this half and they're going to spend it right here in fact so it'll be third down and four when play resumes with a minute and fortythree seconds to play in the first half LSU on top six to three and we have a moment to visit this campus in Lexington University of Kentucky researchers have assumed a leading role in many fields including cancer research biology of the aging energy and equine research projects are undertaken not only to advance knowledge but to meet the needs of society the University of Kentucky where some of our greatest victories are in the research laboratory now Michael's League rosca Jim Bergamo at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington Kentucky were the Wildcats of Kentucky have it third down and four from the 26 yard line 143 to play in the first half Ransdell on a draw play and the crowd is getting as frustrated as a wildcat sorry Sean Burks makes the tackle and now LSU alertly takes a timeout I say alert leave me has been oh they're gonna get it back on a pot now that's the advantage of having somebody like Karns Parker and even though genius is a loosely used term right now they've all built a defense of genius for years and he has told his defensive unit when you get into a situation like this you know you're gonna get the ball back don't waste a second take that timeout immediately give the offense that much more time he was right on top of it exactly well he's considered one of the great defensive minded in the in the history of football they say he's like a chess player out there that he just always anticipate the offenses move so this timeout is the first of the half taken by LSU they'll have two remaining when they get the ball back as Calhoun will punt for Kentucky and dropping back to receive for the Tigers will be Norman Jefferson number 12 another great day for Calhoun he was third in the country and punting coming into the game he's checking into the wind this time and this is a bad kick off the side of his foot angling toward the far side and picked up at the 38 and run back to the 41 of IRA Hodge number seven so near midfield after a 34 yard kick it's the Tigers of LSU taking over for highs made the wrong cut there should have gone for the out of bounds at the 42 Wickersham on first down as time throws it over the middle of ranch in for a nice game down the Kentucky 40yard line box stop for the first down as LSU gets lined up without a huddle don't want to use a timeout here they have two left at their disposal clock begins to roll again on first down as Jon batiste carries for just a yard getting to the 39 yard line it'll be second down Wickersham now 7 of 18 in the passing department for a hundred and 55 yards and he goes again with no huddle second and nine you can see the clock with 50 seconds Wickersham throwing over the middle that's complete he finds his tight end mix Andrews and Andrews has a first down as Brian Williams makes the tackle Andrews first catch of the day but he's a dependable tight in 6 3 to 35 with 4 6 speed he had 26 catches last year for 337 yards clock starts to run again Wickersham after barking out instructions dropping looking left throwing to the far side intercepted by Gordon Jackson so again Wickersham the victim of an Alf an ER where the defensive back steps up and that time it was Magee the intended receiver and Jackson takes a scoring opportunity away from LSU another one Raji Magee number 80 is running a sideline cut on the left now he's a little late in releasing the ball here and because of that Gordon Jackson number 24 anticipates the sideline cut steps in front of Magee and makes the interception that's LSU's fifth turnover three fumbles two interceptions and out of the power I they'll be content to run Logan fumbles and LSU thinks they have it back and let's wait and see they do LSU has recovered of all things you line up in the power I you got Mark Logan carrying you're just gonna run the clock down at this point because you don't have any timeouts left and you cough up the football Henry Thomas number 96 made the recovery turnovers for Qatar's to go wide makes his cut up field he's hit right there and the ball is covered by Thomas number 96 that's Brad Meyers number 71 the offensive guard freshman from miamisburg Ohio who is the injured Wildcat with 22 seconds remaining to be played in the first half so we've had nine turnovers in the game Kentucky with for LSU was five and LSU will have a chance of least two and three more as Myers is able to get up and with some assistance he will be moved over to the near side they might throw twice for the end zone before they do that so it's been a first half dominated by mistakes dominated by turnover is dominated by penalties dominated by missed opportunities and the score is six to three LSU dominated by just about everything except proper execution Wickersham going bitch Andrews intended receiver be second down and 10 LSU with two timeouts remaining the kind of first half you hate to have to look at again during a film session not much of it makes either teams highlight film I'll tell you that second is tan Wickersham the ranch in he gets to the 21 yard line that stops the clock with seven seconds and also LSU will take a timeout clock will stop anyway because of the first down and now LSU calls a full timeout to discuss what they like to do here from the 21 yard line Tigers on top by a score of 6 to 3 this is Kentucky's first true test this season in terms of quality opposition LSU met Florida and they started awfully Gainesville then they've reeled off four consecutive wins since Gary Claiborne and showing some instructions to his teammate on defense camp Jacobs Kentucky's been hurt by some injuries at LSU obviously go for the field goal better back the Smith Brothers are out for the Wildcats a couple of defensive store words who are gone probably for the season both of them meanwhile but able to salvage something from the opportunities that LSU has had they lead by a score of nine to three he missed a 41yard der in the first quarter made a 43yarder later in the period and a 20yard are here in the second period and now this one 9 to 3 LSU on top with two seconds or just about 1 run back left we're part of a run back anyway in the first half the key play of course was that catch by rats Jen who's having a good day filling in for Jerry James who we've been talking about Batson has caught three now for 53 yards The Times owes to kick off the probably bounce it down and not give them any opportunity to run it back LSU on top nine to three full cloud cover right now totally overcast here in Lexington bouncing ball is fielded up at the 19 yard line and run back for the 30 by a Reynard over so at same time it's time to three let's get back to Jim Bergamo Jim thank you very much folks I guess you got to be pretty thankful to your defense to keep you in so far we played good defense we just got to get something going offensively that's our

community because its members share common problems and opportunities nakba conducts management seminars which focus on contemporary and longrange strategies state of the arts business technology is keeping collegiate athletic departments in step with the times through next this week marks the 60th anniversary of two events that happened back in 1924 on the same autumn afternoon and afternoon much like this one that changed the law and romance of college football forever one of them happened in Champaign Urbana Illinois and the other at the Polo Grounds in New York City that day was homecoming day at the University of Illinois they were dedicating their new Memorial Stadium to those men of Illinois who had died in World War one in the first 12 minutes against the University of Michigan Harold Red Grange touched the ball six times and scored four touchdowns he gained 252 yards in those first 12 minutes and left the game before the first quarter was over he came back in the third quarter to his score his fifth touchdown on a 13 yard run and in the final period threw a touchdown pass the galloping ghosts was redhot that day he was the prototype of every brilliant halfback you have seen since right down to the water Peyton's with Tony Dorsett and the Marcus Allen's of today in 41 minutes on that afternoon Red Grange carried the ball 21 times for 402 yards he proved six passes for 67 yards it was an awesome autumn afternoon while Red Grange was running up and down the field of Memorial Stadium in Champaign Urbana the Notre Dame team coached by Knute Rockne had come into the Polo Grounds in New York to meet a very strong army team and the Irish beat the cadets 13 to 7 as the cat was filing out of the Polo Grounds the southern gentlemen up in the press box began pecking away at his typewriter outlined against the blue collar gray October sky he wrote before horsemen wrote again period in dramatic lore they are known as famine comma pestilence comma destruction and death period they are only aliases period their real names are still there Miller Crowley and lately period with those few opening sentences Grantland rice not only bestowed immortality upon Knute Rockne's Notre Dame football team but on himself as well because 60 years later sports writers and sports casters are still trying to get an opening lead to a story as good as that salmon rice like Red Grange was also a prototype and future writers like Redd Smith and Frank Graham and today's sports writers built on the foundation that granny laid down and so running backs in high school and college and in the pro ranks and sports writers and sports casters everywhere can look back to that long ago autumn Saturday with thanks the day that Red Grange and Grantland rice lit up that blue gray October sky a little girl was proud I had to save her she made it I didn't I thought about my own little girl we protect bird around Stevie boy you live to tell about it I got a second chance to protect my own as well as other at Prudential we know most of us don't get a second chance talk to a Prudential agents and get the peace of mind that comes with a piece of the rock we're all safe now finding out what your homeowners insurance covers after an accident is too late get a prove review and let a Prudential agent review your coverage that's covered I think maybe it's not be sure of what you're insured for get a pro review get Prudential crew review it's fast and free college football the allamerican game the Prudential halftime report has been sponsored by Prudential for life held auto home get a piece of the rock Prudential Insurance LSU on top leading Kentucky by a score of nine to three going to take a look at some halftime statistics and Lee as we look at those it pretty much reflects LSU's dominance and they've dominated everywhere but on the scoreboard 275 and of course initially Kentucky couldn't even get a first down there in the first half but what's really dominated the game and you said this is that penalties and turnovers have really been the story of the first half a total of nine turnovers if you combine the two 301 275 in total yardage a four to one ratio LSU moved on top by a score of three to nothing but then one of the key plays for Kentucky came here is we were isolated at that point on Eric Martin and a fine defensive play was made by Maurice Douglas for the intercept Douglas number 27 cut right in front of Eric Martin knocked out of bound the battle third by Wickersham but they have gambled a couple of times defensively and it's paid off for them let's set up the tying field goal it was tied momentarily anyway by Joe early number 15 but two more field goals for LSU and then the Tigers leave now 9 to 3 one batons OSes accounted for all of the scoring so now if you're at both coaches say what are you talking about it in the locker room at this point pal I don't think that you're gonna see any radical departure from the initial game plan on the part of either coach when we talked to Jerry Claiborne yesterday he said that he knew he was the underdog he knew that there were certain things he would have pursued certain things he could not do because of the limitations he had in terms of his personnel he would ideally like to establish a running game throw safe passes high percentage passes keep the ball away from LSU because he knows that they have the firepower conversely LSU I think is gonna open it up a little bit more in the second half I think you'll see them throwing a little bit more on first down and I think you might see wickersham trying to take advantage of the middle more because he's not having good luck throwing on the outside this ABC Sports exclusive is being brought to you by US Armed Forces it's a great place to start by chevrolet who invites you to see today's chevy drive today chevy lifted a chevy by Napa make your car in Napa brandnew today and by JCPenney today there's more style and everything you do and there's more style than ever at JC Penney you're looking smarter than ever JCPenney teams coming back onto the field imminently as we get set for the second half in Lexington Louisiana state nine Kentucky three at halftime this is today's Chevrolet nearly four hours that's how long it took us to paint this room with a roller then we painted it in less than one hour with the new Wagner power or a living room it took nearly seven hours a wagon of hora finished in less than three the power roller pumps paint straight from the can to the roller or to any of several optional accessories why waste your time painting a pan when you could be painting your walls instead the Wagner power or the right tool for painting it's like turning back the miles on your car when you use quality nappa brand parts so whether you do it yourself or have it done for you make it nappa brandnew like now during that Picard Care days with quality napa auto parts it's almost like turning your car back to when it was new look for the Napa car care day planner and finding Tigers of LSU back out of the field at Commonwealth Stadium have had no rain today during the course of this one a few sprinkles this morning very very overcast but pretty comfortable as the temperature has remained at or near I would guess the 65 degree mark today so it's quite pleasant for the fans in terms of the weather but not very pleasant in terms of the way their Kentucky Wildcats have been playing and for that matter even though LSU has dominated statistically they've made so many mistakes that we still have a very close ballgame nine three at the half let's go to Jim Bergamo okay oh hey coach Claiborne in a hurry we'll try to catch him just in a little bit so as Claybourne goes back to this I don't know that the jury was gonna say anything that we necessarily wanted to hear to begin with it if you keep looking for me he can't be too excited about the way things are going I think he'd probably say something like well we've got to avoid mistakes and we want to reestablish our running game and ultimately it's gonna come down to putting some points up on the board I think probably play something on that and I think that's a pretty good imitation all things considered going coaches are put in a pretty tough position sometimes you'll get some gems in those halftime sideline interviews but for the most part they want to get back to their group and then they can't tell you too much and if they could tell you too much they wouldn't anyway for fear that the word would leak down to the opposing side I can't imagine the coach ever coming on the national original television at halftime we've seen that's between you and me and the fans we're gonna do a whole other thing yeah we're we're gonna come out with a fleaflicker on the first plate right back to receive before Kentucky will be mark Logan and George Adams Logan 25 and Adams is 33 and it's back to Frank to kick off for LSU second half is underway good deep kick and a touch back filled it in the back of the endzone by Logan LSU defense you've got Tommy clack been from Houston Texas comes Henry Thomas who recovered a fumble for a stamp Wilson is a good one the best of the three down men then the linebackers outstanding yet de Brock and you got Burks who had a good first half as well and Ricky Chapman was involved in a lot of action and then the sophomore Michael Brooks the man who before he is finished will probably make some allamerican teams maybe not this year necessarily but he's only a sophomore with plenty of time for heavy the good looking linebackers Pass is low and incomplete as we start the second half Guidry is one corner for LSU Kevin number 27 Norma person the other corner also runs back the punch and the safeties are outstanding Jeff Dale and Hobley you probably know more about Hobley if you sort of casually follow college football it gets more publicity but Dale is right there with it the pros like full of LSU safety second down and ten at the 20 I'd line Ramsdell here's the ball to Adam who is not much of a factor in the first half but begin to attack the 30yard line where he is stopped by Lippert Hobley that right there is probably the best look at George Adam look at the offensive line probably Shurtleff is the most consistent of that one right there Adams numbers now 14 carries for 34 yards and 10 on the last carry so he was 13 for 33 in the van beginning here for the second half as he carries for four yards this time and Carl Wilson number 72 makes the tackle so again Adams figures to be a very key man he's been a very key man all season long for them a gentleman who should be a firstround draft choice extremely highly regarded not particularly fast he doesn't have that overpowering speed but he's big and strong and fast enough second down and six and they call his number again it goes down into for a first down out to the 43 yard line he himself can begin to turn this game around if he has a good second hand what was that about it he's their workhorse not only is he effective at the I back position but occasionally they'll line him up in the slot and there he can work both the reverses and also be effective as a receiver and he's very sure handed they really need a good hand I just can't imagine Kentucky winning without Adams having a good half he's that important to their offense first half of the 42 yard line give it to Adams again down at the 43yard line very little room as he runs into michael brooks the sophomore and Carl Wolfson the other sophomore so apparently the game plan for this second half is to be more basic initially they have lined up in the I formation on every play high formation plays constitute about 40 percent of their attack they have become much more multiple as we mentioned earlier on Jerry Claiborne ideally would like to line up in the eye and just pound on you second a nine blindsided and sacked at the 34yard line that's Jeffrey Dale the less heralded of those two safety Bob Lee getting Scylla to that precedes and publicity that you tend to forget about deal the deal made Ramsdale remember him in a hurry three four is the base look and they don't have a high frequency of blitzes but when they do the Tigers have been very effective coming on the blind side is safety man Jeffrey Dale number four and in the life of every quarterback there is always a blindside why I'm happy to be here with you not there in your seventeenth year absolutely ready for the whole bunch of white shirts intended for Joe Joker Phillips fourth down soda with the promising beginning to that drive for concessions where they bogged down and thus active Deven and now norm Jefferson goes back to receive and Calhoun to punch now hold punting into the wind high kick spinning tick FairTax ball four and then recovered from there 1206 to go third quarter LSU by six today's cars do things yesterday's cars didn't they're smaller higher revving engines begin to break down and/or don't miss company within 1500 so suffers no significant loss of its out to be even after be telling you something Kestrel engineered for smaller cars remember when you'd wear anything as long as it was navy blue today you're more of an individual when I design my clothes I like to mix subtle colors that create interesting combinations combinations that help you to create your own personal style that's my idea fashion the LSU fighting Tigers have the ball at their own 21 yard line first and 10 their first offensive play of the half and the Staunton Hilliard sweeping to the right take a look at the Cincinnati defensive end John dumb bald as a junior he too comes from the state of Ohio to the door Frank Harris from right here in town a senior Steve Thompson from Louisville about 75 miles away bill comes Gary Reed Brian Williams the defensive end punt returner a very odd combination meanwhile Fontenot is taken up the wide out for louisiana state assisted to his feet doesn't appear to be anything serious and Dalton Hilliard who we spotlighted at the very top of our show along with George Adams is closing in on the hundred yard mark now is his rushing he has 21 carries for 97 yards he got 11 yards on that last year picked up 152 did Hilliard last week against Vanderbilt for no game linebacker Jeff Cramer from Newport Kentucky just across the river from Cincinnati Camp Jacob is probably their best backer right now an injuryriddled Judith Russ Hairston the defensive back along with Gordon Jackson there the corners and the sole safety is Paul Calhoun looking for allconference honors senior from Louisville second and 10 Wickersham he's been protected well today throwing it out of the flat garland done Pete he's run out of bounds near the 36 yard line saying you got a wickersham Hilliard and rasped in the running back spot no avoid the white outs again James's hurt did not suit up today Harold or Campbell Langford Lance Smith is is the big man number 75 and Andrew comprising the LSU front third down and six Tigers from the 36th drive line they lead nine to three Sam complete does get the first down McDavid Rouge had the presence of mind to see where that marker was and get that extra yard that they needed to pick up the first and keep this drive going he's got 12 on the season and that makes 13 now this doesn't surprise me too much we talked about this at halftime I thought Wickersham would be throwing more and I figured he'd come with more of the thinking dunk routes initially because he was putting the ball up field a lot in the first half so he's got the the linebackers deep conscious now Hilliard big hole first down he gets to the Wildcat 41 yard line he is quick Dalton Hilliard particularly big fire that will put him over the hundred yard mark what's the hole on the left side here good blocking here we've got a trap we've got a long trap play on the left side good block by number 71 right there for LSU that's Langford this one is complete to lock it all from back in the game and she takes the ball for 32 yard line they stopped by for a signature they go right back to the year and find Fontenot and this is the pattern that we saw exhibited in the first half for LSU moves and moves and moves and moves and wood stymie them or the turnovers and the best chances and missed opportunities in the first to happen here they are moving again they can cash in so Dillard now with a hundred and eleven yards on 23 carry second and a short to and it's john mckean to the 31 I believe he has the first down clock shows 9 minutes and 50 seconds remaining in the third quarter have not had a touchdown in this one LSU on top 9 to 3 if you're tuning in late really hasn't been what you'd call a defensive struggle despite the low score in a game that's been riddled with penalties and mistakes both sides both teams have had excellent opportunities they just haven't cashed in on the first half from the 31 yard line Jerry Reese freshman at a Hopkinsville Kentucky to replace starters Jeff Smith we talked about the Smith Brothers being gone Greece is one of the substitutes and he gets the back here that'll get a quarterback thinking about you that kind of a shot on the blindside Jerry Reese's 62 to 44 second down 19 now with wickersham going back going over the middle and it's complete sunlight and white takes it down of the 18 and that's the first down so after the sack back he comes he finds his allamerica wide receiver again Martin is still looking for his first touchdown reception the season Eric Martin who is already the most prolific receiver in LSU history earlier passing Andy Hamilton gets into the seam right here on a curl in fact that ball was thrown about as perfect as it could be thrown to the 19 yard line now Jon batiste for a gain of five garland and John Vicki's sophomore from st. martinville Louisiana seeing more action today that he has this game again because of the injury to Gary James who would normally be in with LSU now refers to as their Fingal back position they don't want to call him a fullback they call him the Bengal back they just eliminated the term pull back when arms Berger took over yanked it right out of the dictionary right off the show kill you see his way into the endzone for the touchdown matter of railway Hill years to play today basically just a matter of time before they were able to move it in and here they go on their first series of the second hand till you this is vintage billiard right here because he starts white makes the cut right there and then just dances into the endzone 24 carries on the day now for a hundred and twentyfive yards that one going for 14 yards and a touchdown perfect cut and Dalton Hilliard is just put LSU on top 15 to 3 going on 60 now is the time those well time is called by wicker Shea and the question is do they want with a 12 point lead to bring in but times us and go for 1 or would they rather go between make it 14 be a thirsty not gonna do a lot of good totally rude to point play is to simple convergence Wickersham isn't tremendously mobile but he's mobile enough I think this printout and pressure of the corner and usually if you can do that with some kind of a combination pattern it results in a good twopoint play probably the best guy that I have seen in recent years on the twopoint play is Steve Young but when he was at BYU and during his rookie season for the Los Angeles Express very successful on the two points late eight minutes and five seconds remaining in the third period Tigers for Owen one coming in Wildcats five it off Tigers one hole and one in conference play twopoint conversion that's Fontenot emotion so they have three receivers to the right and it goes number six Ashton the junior saving and so they settle for sentence and we have 8:05 to play in the third quarter in Lexington Kentucky it's now LSU 15 Kentucky 3 this is mr. Goodwrench and did you know there are ways you can tell if you're GM cars shock absorbers are ok for one check your tires if they show unusual wear like coming in one spot it can mean worn socks make your car hard to handle so see mr.

plus fountains more the New York City Marathon live next Sunday on ABC numbers down the Tiger scoring drive 11 plays well conceived took the poor old one Hilliard made his way in from the 14 LSU now leads by a dozen and the kickoff is fielded at the by Logan and Logan taken after the 24yard first container they're now coming up Sunday tomorrow we have a special Sunday night edition following the presidential debate 9:40 Eastern Time the Cowboys it's the LA Rams coming off their victory over to where they in Sinking on the Atlanta Falcon Gerald Rix 9 o'clock Eastern on Monday grams Dell over the middle and that intercepted at the 34 by Chapman and Kentucky is in a lot of trouble right now that's the kind of play that can turn a game around completely Ricky Chapman number 37 has been a big play man for the tigers Ransdell Sprint's to his left looks back to his right then turns over the middle and he should have never thrown that ball he wanted Erik pitch number 33 83 with Chapman number 37 is right there this turnover for Kentucky and here comes Hilliard again and Hilliard gets to the 12 you're right Lee this type of play that can turn a game around me as a team has just run down the field on the end scored to put you up by more than one touchdown 12 points in fact then you come you come right back and you give it right back to him they got a chance to move it here and if they go up let's say twenty two to three the way the Kentucky office says played today and say no chance at all billiards inside the five and Hilliard goes all the way down to almost the goal I didn't quite get there inside the one is gonna be first and goal well sometimes you get a sense of the momentum just turning around after a play like that you get an impressive Drive such as LSU ad then the turnover and assuming they go in to score again now it just takes the energy out of the team they give it to Hillier golfin Hilliard is in again and so it in a minute's time Dalton Hilliard scores twice and LSU has broken an open on Hilliard's eighth touchdown of the season we talked earlier about the dive play that has spent popular through the years we think of Sam BAM Cunningham but there have been many backs to do this well executed there by Dalton Hilliard he really got some height Hilliard now at 13 career hundred yard games he's gone over 100 in for the sixth game this season but time does this kick is good and this crowd is really quiet 702 to go in the third period and LSU in command on top twenty two two three there's a charming life for the young to say I want something else a different way you can down the same the people to school is opening something to food the services haven't it'll really show you'll see new places you'll really grow in the Army Navy Air Force

easy bill arns Breyer has just block fifteens for two quick touchdowns they lead twenty two to three Gerry claybournes team is gonna have to try something different I don't think they can stick to what their original game plan was is Logan takes it on past the ten fumbles the ball and it LS you get it before it went out of bounds though look like one of the Tigers was right there number 48 was the man for LSU Nikki hazard who almost came up with the ball it'll look right here Nikki hazard a freshman linebacker number 48 peers to have the ball but he never had position before he crossed the boundary line there the boundary never lies boundaries never missed a tackler some famous coach once it that's right oxide anyway so I'll do it one more time I believe that that famous gurus are our ABC colleague Frank royal Frank has a high consciousness about the bathroom good way to put it when he was trying to tell everybody if we're sitting on defense you drive it right over toward the sidelines and let the sidelines do the work fire simple as that LSU on top twenty two to three 653 remaining to be played in the third period now we were talking about coming out of a game plan Lee what about Kentucky right now I mean they're their basic plan has been for the most part to go with Adams this season he's not had a good day today they're really unable to get anything going now what well I mean you're down by 19 points in the middle of the third quarter the game plan does change you don't panic you're not into it with Sue a panic attack but you're gonna have to start putting it up a little bit more on first and second down that's Adams number 33 he gets a cold at the nineteen another flag you bicker this yellow flag out of the pockets and one of the officials ubiquitous is a nice multisyllabic word and I like to get those in least once a game only way to describe what we've seen here today to be honest with you back with us or handkerchief Howard might say there has been a plethora of ubiquitous yellow flags you're absolutely right Claiborne mom he was the national coach of the year back in Stephanie voice when he was in Maryland first and ten from the six yard line Logan it's after the 16 you mentioned some alterations in the game plan I think one of them obviously would be to get the ball to Logan more because he is their burners certainly Adams is their workhorse their nutsandbolts runner their bread and butter guy but in the game when you're down by 19 points you want to try to get the ball more through your burners the guys who can flat fly quite a difference they're totally yardage LSU nice balance too and they would have a lot more points we're not for all the mistakes second and one fumble another fumble and decide unless you recover it boy it's gonna just a terrible day for the Wildcats and the opportunistic Ricky Chatham rightfully chatlin right again another look right here is Ricky Chapman recovering the fumble although the tailback number 25 right there and what's the hit by Jefferson first number 12 and Ricky Chapman number 37 again johnnyonthespot well with 602 to go in the third period you got a lot of folks getting up with the thermoses and the jackets and the heading for the parking lot and Hillier is going to send him to the parking lot in the bigger hurry as he goes in for the touchdown close and Hillier scoring the touchdown number nine this season for him and the third of the period for Dalton Hilliard as LSU has just broken the game wide open and it seems like a tornado has hit here in the third quarter as that firepower of LSU finally starts on track it's the same play a start to the right a cutback another cut by Hilliard and into the end zone he goes untouched at the end he of course along with Gary James were part of that incredible freshman tandem in 1982 we covered them that dirt pecans Oh sticking the extra point they were known as flash and that among other things Hilliard three TVs in the last 109 and LSU is on top twenty nine to three can't say uh sadhu wasn't that exciting can't say is there eco if you didn't get excited the last time you had chicken by Kentucky Fried Chicken if we make it with a secret blend of herbs and spices now this is exciting 55 to Sears to get you a new battery and it's the lowest price of the season just $49.99 install thanks and I save $20 well Sears has the biggest savings ever on weatherwise steelbelted radials lowest $34.99 installed penalty on the last play as one but Pazzo's follows through on his kick there it is the obvious infraction number six Russell hair steady runs into the kicker so the Opena t will the penalty will be affixed now so the tazos will kick from the 45 yard line LSU 29 Kentucky 3 and here is the Frank to kickoff angle of the kick on the end zone Suzanne Annie and will come out to the 20yard line where the disparity I've gots will take over another good day for hilly I think those numbers are becoming rather commonplace for Dalton Hilliard it's really very much a typical day for him as Kentucky meanwhile now goes to the bench in the Kevin Dulli a freshman from Cincinnati is coming in at quarterback it's a good offense for a runner like Dalton Hilliard because they have so many different weapons that they can't really concentrate on Hilliard they spread the defense a lot Hilliard is able to run tackle to tackle also get wide he's also been effective at times as a receiver not so much today but particularly on the cutback runs today he's been extremely effective Randall 3 out of 14 with 33 yards and two interceptions today so those kind of number is in when you down by 26 points what the heck here's a freshman to try Kevin Dulli Mila personal file only receiving theme the point the Holi in this game could we have a touchback any personal foul on the touchback that takes it back to the 10yard line New York City Marathon comes your way next Sunday at 10:30 Eastern Time this scheme is beginning to look like a marathon for Kentucky 29 to 3 as the pass is blocked at the 26 yard line by Oliver white number 87 second drop pass on the day for all of her white who is normally the most surehanded target they have at his tight end position and so Kevin Dulli number 18 replacing Ransdell number nine is right on target white comes out Kevin Dulli is a sophomore academically he was redshirted last year well this is his first of four eligible years and from the 10yard line Dooley's swings one after Adam tries to pick up some blocking and he moves it out to the 14 yard line and we can spend a moment with Jim Lampley go phone all right groove out in Buffalo or up in Boulder I should say Nebraska has gone on top of Colorado 10 7 the big red on a Travis Turner run taking the lead Colorado wearing the black shirts for the first time in years they couldn't have more incentive but they trail now back to you LSU on top here 29 to 3 Dulli in at quarterback right now has completed 2 of 8 this season going into the game for 18 yards on third and 17 private draw and Adam but his best run of the day the 29yard live but I think he is I suck the fill of the weight when they scramble their whether or not he got the first down he's close to it they needed to move to the 30yard line George Adams told us yesterday this is his favorite play the draw or the sprint draw it'll counteract in their left first to the right look at the power the speed and the authority that he runs with and that's the reason the pro scouts think he is one of the premier allpurpose back in college football well he just did picked up that first down as he got it out to the 30 yard line those of the ball resting on the strike first down for Kentucky at that spot newly complete in the 38 yard line Eric Fitch number 83 for a gain of seven or so under five minutes now remaining to be played in the third period so Dooley shows you there that he has a good strong arm threw the ball through the hook patter in that time exactly the way it should be thrown low and hard second down short to Julie wait down ladies mark wheeler hora Annandale Virginia same pattern different receiver but pattern on the right side the number 80 mark wheeler 62 210 pound sophomore these cat fans are pumped up walk cakes from Dan at tailback number 22 behind the fullback Gary who didn't carry the ball today and give it to hey so a 26point LSU lead but the Wildcats are not giving up anyway pigs lining up in the tailback position takes the same play that Rodgers ran a few moments ago it's the tailback draw play starting left cutting back to his right goes a little limp leg right there and a Juke step along the sidelines first down from the 41 yard line and it takes again breaks a couple of tempos then gets to the 30yard line I meant another first down and I would have to think they're a couple of players on LSU who might be going back to last week when they led 34 to 6 at the end of the third period and when it was over it was 34 27 and they were hanging on for dear life key here is how Higgs number 22 breaks the tackle right here that Springs him into the secondary that's a great second effort there and then you see that he continues to run with authority before he's finally brought down by Hobley number 29 last week LSU lacked at whatever it was the knockout punch as they let Vanderbilt get back into the game so a 28point lead become a seven point lead very very quickly and he's trying to avoid a repeat of that situation first down for the 30yard line on Kentucky's first sustained Drive of the day thanks again picks up the yard and once again let's go to the Appleman lamps Alan I don't think I've told you yet that Houston did hold on to beat sixth ranked SMU 29:20 dropping the Mustangs from the ranks of the unbeaten untied first regular season loss for SMU to somebody other than Texas since 1980 what does it mean means South Carolina for the first time in its history we'll move into the top ten back to you well SMU next week they really have their hands full coming off that loss as they take on Texas call me party through the second down and nine from the 29 yard line and I believe Kentucky gets his back Cornell Burbage was the receiver and it looked like Chris Derry number 44 the fullback down in the area though recovers it to keep possession for Kentucky Dooley the Bourbon to Derry the triple play there's the cats by Burbidge right there breaks the tackle that's where he loses the ball table number twentynine hits it and here comes Chris Derry number 44 first and gold out the oneyard line animals to the one Lippert probably came up to at least temporarily stave off a touchdown with two minutes 25 seconds to play in the third period when they get down here the guy that liked to get it to his George Adams and you see him try to fly like Sam BAM Cunningham used to do or Herschel Walker that's been their batter out but right now he's not going to be flying on his next play it be some fly if he did it from the sidelines yeah we'll find out about Higgs though he figures to carry and here he goes number 22 and he tries to borough is Lee and it doesn't do Brock 44 making the tackle Wildcats trying to scratch and claw their way back into this game down by 26 you get captain tankers there's gonna be some scratching and cause third goal give a damn there nice Drive engineered by the freshmen Kevin Dulli George Adams number 33 here's George takes about three steps they search his leap from about the two and a half yard line you got a nice block there for a number 44 Chris Dario at the lead block on the play then his momentum carried him in Worley kicked out of the hold by Jones that's good new light for the Kentucky Wildcats led by the freshman Kevin Dulli who took up 90 yards and LSU on top now by a score of 29 to 10 with one minute and 26 seconds remaining in the third period so with a home crowd behind him 19 points with a full quarter to go that's certainly not an insurmountable lead it's incumbent on your defense now to stop the Tigers next week para games for you Texas against SMU and Notre Dame against LSU as the bengal tigers come back on the tube at 3:30 Eastern Time next Saturday on CFA college football after Death Valley at least it's in the daytime which will help Notre Dame at night is anybody who's been there knows it is tough to win in Tiger Stadium that's where they say Tiger bait Tiger bait Tiger bait there's Julie in a second year here but did the freshman athletically Adams going over from the one as the Wildcats moved all the way down the field and LSU now leads by a score of 29 to 10 Worley kicking off and it's fielded back at the three yard line by the freshman Sam Whiteman and he's buried at the 12 makes it to 17 Martin had to race back to make the play because LSU at all of their met up duty this field strike to protect against the possibility of an onside kick but Kentucky figuring they have enough time showing the onside kick and taking a chance of letting their defense hold LSU and getting the ball back Tigers today Jon batiste pickup of 6yard after the 24 yard line I think this is gonna be a key defensive series for the Wildcats right now because they do have some of the momentum back they could force a turnover here they could get back in the ball game in a hurry very important or at least hold them on downs and give that offense a chance to get started started one more time one more touchdown put you within say 12 points and it's a whole other story also to be a real confidence builder for their quarterback their young quarterback Kevin Dulli who was engineered 1 touchdown drive now could he do it again that it would really be a shot in the arm second down four make it three and a half for yard line and bullying his way for a first down now past the 28 yard line it's a first down as patty okay let's go to Jim again and now al just as though you're at home in Menlo Park let's go through the pac10 the Trojans are tied up with Arizona 1414 in the third UCLA's john lee missed a field goal for the first time all year today they trailed 147 to Cal in the fourth Stanford is beating Washington State now 35 7 in the 3rd quarter what about number one Washington just got a field goal to go on top of Oregon in the 3rd 10 7 back to out so the game's on the west coast well underway is we're at about 23 minutes past 6:00 o'clock in lexington kentucky and the sun going down to be a nice day and the third quarter has come to its conclusion that commonwealth stadium with

sideline and LSU with the ball as garland Jon batiste carries after the 34 yard line and speaking of Jim Bergamo you're it all right thanks very much now you know a lot of people's been asking the question what is the difference in this LSU team isn't the personnel the same but the difference basically is Bill arns Barger he came in took one look at his players said they need to lose weight and also his preparation you know in Miami he had the nickname of one more real because he always wanted to look at one more reel of film and his preparation his close friends tell me is obviously paid off at this ballclub he's become a very popular figure already because he's the coach of an unbeaten team they're trying to remain that way failure takes it out for a gain of one and it's tackled by Tony Mays out of the 35 yard line as we look at the numbers through the first 45 minutes we've been talking right along about the domination in total yards of LSU over Kentucky 423 to 186 but also the sloppiness of the game because of turnover a total now of a weapon between the two team third down and four incomplete it will be fourth down and so the Kentucky defense is able to hold well Jim Bergamo just made an important point when he talked about Bill arm garters philosophy of getting the team to be a little bit leaner they were known as the Lunch Bunch in 1983 they decided that they wanted to get the body fat ratio down with all of the players so one player in particular was Atlanta Smith yep lost a total of 40 pounds and a lot of body fat Lance with the kind of guys could probably be drafted very high so he's a lot leaner I suppose he's a lot meaner as well they like the job he's been doing short bouncing kick but it makes a good LSU bounce off the foot of Parker thus with 13 34 remaining to be played in the fourth curry at at Lexington at LSU 29 Kentucky 10 and the Wildcats have the ball looks like you're into winning do best then today Chevrolet has a car for you Cavaliers come on in two liters of electronically fuelinjected power frontdrive agility and optional sports suspension Cavalier grap one in business today Chevrolet it's a winner retain steady get ready for excitements when Korres is on ah where's the Coors Light have a ween tomorrow night at an NFL special the Saints puddle the Cowboys and on Monday Night Football Eric Dickerson in Los Angeles we're off against Atlanta two super matchups only on ABC Kentucky has the football at the 20yard line first and ten and it's duly going to the air rambles side and gets wrapped up by Saturn in number 37 all over the place good day for that man good backers at LSU most of the publicity has gone to Berks and also to Brooks they are known as the killer bees 1984 Chapman is proving he is no stiff today very nice job along with Dew Brock 2nd down and 9 from the 21 yard line Julie so the LSU defense is responding hereafter for Kentucky's only sustained attack Henry Thomas number 96 creating the loss right there so Phil aren't Parker who as you mentioned has been regarded as a defensive genius had the killer bees the original killer bees at Miami also the noname defense considered a defensive genius says had a very diversified coaching career started college at the University of Kentucky spin in the marine corps graduate of Miami of Ohio coached there and many other places third down and two throws over the middle and incomplete so dually unable to get anything going this time for a Kentucky and they'll be forced to kick 12 minutes one second remaining yo the yell up Sue's nickname is Joker it's wide open on this flight he's down about 18 yards and runs a breakin pattern he sits down in the open area waved his hands Julie's about a foot high but he's wide open in the seam for Calhoun and another penalty so far LSU has been penalized seven times for 66 yards Kentucky eleven times for 67 yards and you have just watched your 19th penalty of the game you've had 19 penalties and 11 turnovers dead ball foul illegal procedure offense norms a person back to receive at the 30 yard line with Calhoun sitting up for the punt standing on his goal line good long kick Jefferson from the 29 to the 35 in the 40 that was a 56yard punt Tigers have it back near midfield with 11:48 to play in the game Holly if you don't hurt I'll miss my play with a new scent avantco wiper blades

Pontiac Oldsmobile GMC truck Buick Cadillac tell your GM dealer you want GMAC financing that's the easy part next Saturday on CFA college football number three ranked Texas takes on number six SMU or the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame battle night Frank LSU next Saturday on ABC Kenny wolf our producer Larry kam our director kind enough to throw up that shot for Lee gross stuff and I who just love to fly through cumulus clouds but that's the type of buildup you have here cumulus Nimbus side of Lexington hanging right over bluegrass field at the moment I'm sure from the 42 yard line Dalton Hilliard is run out of bounds at about the 46 one thing to say on the ground if you're LSU and they figure to do it it's another thing too that if you've got the ball in your hands you really don't want to go out of bounds you want that clock to keep running camp Jacobs number 48 the linebacker for Kentucky has probably been the most productive player for them defensively today and it's one of the things coaches like to show you in the highlights film he gets rid of a block where he pursues laterally he comes across there has a nice low center of gravity then takes the command down along the side let's call playing wall to wall linebacker on second down and seven Wickersham going deep and incomplete you know it's interesting in a sense last week talked about the fact LSU almost blew that lead against Vanderbilt 34 six the thing that really got Vanderbilt started was with a twenty eight point lead they went to the air and an interception was run back for a touchdown that got Vandy up and moving now here you have eleven and a half minutes to go in the game a 19 point lead Kentucky doesn't look like they can get back into the game the way they've been going offensive Lee and yet you've got the first guy Hilliard running out of bounds and then Wickersham going to the air and he's going to do it here again on third down and incomplete so they had a chance to run some time off the clock and they didn't only a few seconds off it Kentucky's gonna get it back but of course we have another penalty strange series of calls of course that's not where's em himself those plays they're called for him holding against LSU reg it's a curious situation especially in light of the fact that last week a pass when they were leading holding offense decline what's out especially when you have a runner like Hilliard who's hot he's been productive particularly running the right side on cutback plays bigger you could chew up some time and yardage on the ground that's Brian Williams back to return the punt you ever seen a defensive end run back kicks before first time Williams number two he doesn't have a defensive a gift horse in the mouth country that's right they've had a lot of gifts look at the write down their mouths today and they can't do anything with it and you you don't look a gift horse in the what well maybe that's why we have never seen a defensive end run back punch before and we made never again from the 21 yard line 7 turnovers now offside is the call this time against LSU we may set a record today for penalties than turnovers but that's about all tell you what dick pearl says getting more air time these days than mr. t Oh first down you talk about a guy who loves being on camera but how does he chroma key first and 15 from the 26 yard line reverse inside the 25 over 20 and possible Herman von Sydow very versatile good runner good receiver even throw fun though of course recruiters initially out of high school has a running back good allaround athlete has the speed you like six two rounds 200 pounds starts with a pitch to Hilliard the hand back the fun though it look how perfectly it's set up here it's that convoy of blockers and then takes it down in scoring range and meanwhile I tell you who fancies it in for the touchdown dolphins Hilliard scores his fourth touchdown of the day and after a Kentucky seventh turnover LSU has just put the icing on this one spending a lot of the fans home early the ones that weren't going in the third period had a mini accent when the score got to be twenty nine to three and Kentucky looked like they might still be breathing after Dooley led the the only sustained drive of the afternoon for the Wildcats but Hilliard has just nailed it away and the tines those adds the extra point so the LSU Tigers on their way to remaining unbeaten we have 11 minutes to play in the game and it's the Tigers on top by 26 come on America drive over now to Firestone Tire and service center hey kids you go to fourwheel drive from inside then get yourself into a Chevy s10 place at 4x4 and shipped from freewheeling twowheel drive to fourwheel high at any speed no afford can't do that I don't have to get out to lock the hubs Chevy's into fact fourwheel drive system that you do it all from inside so I can stay drive Chevy I like the way your work Dalton Hilliard has scored four touchdowns today that ties in LSU record for most touchdowns rushing in the game held by Charles Alexander as the kickoff by the Frank crosses the and graphically we'll take a look at the sloppiness of this baby LSU with three fumbles and two intercepts for five turnovers Kentucky with seven turnovers 19 penalties of the game it ain't been no clinic Austin 12 turnovers total and 19 penalties yep that's my personal record you can't think of a game I saw a scene where two teams figure to be so evenly matched and coming in unbeaten and had this kind of a day silly throwing and it's complete after the 43 yard line catch me there by Eric Fitch but what happened you know crazily enough we'll talk about this for a second Dooley playaction fake to the tailback sets up at about 7 yards Eric hit number 83 runs a deep curl in cut that ball is thrown well one bright spot for Kentucky is the play of Dooley here in the second half first down from the 44 yard line that's complete 50yard line let's get a word different Jim Bergamo Jim I think yell you know LSU fans are gonna have to get used to watching Gary James in this little apparatus it's a cast made out of absorber thane NCAA rules prohibit anything hard here so you know you can buy assist it can take a pretty good lick the important thing of this cast is the fact that it's got a bear spot there he can hold the ball and he can catch the ball this is what Gary James will be using the rest of the season you know Gary James is not in uniform today hopefully he'll be able to utilize that particular device Oliver white making the catch after the 38 yard line well with James out of there today don't man Hilliard has really shined we mentioned the moment ago that he is now pied a single game record for touchdowns in a single game which was previously held by Charles Alexander in a game against Oregon State back in 1977 from the 38 Heinlein Dooley and he grows to Derry the fullback in the 27yard line and close to a first down spider to save it for later neither team is really playing well even though LSU has played much better than Kentucky has the postmortem to this one will be how terrible Kentucky look offensively I'll be the only thing they'll be talking about in the papers here tomorrow any the turnovers and all and the penalties it won't be quite that bad even though LSU has not had a good day the time of day when they'd have gotten killed by a lot of teams it's a big difference when you come out on the on the positive side of the ledger Higgs carries for about five or six it just doesn't seem like you play quite that badly when you win what absolutely when you you can tend to forget all those penalties and turnovers when you win by 20 points or more you have a type a day LSU time in today and you lose and the next day you pick up the paper and everybody's talking about a terrible you look then it's one more real over and over and over again exactly but if you play this I began to plan and you win one of the different story it's like well we got away with that one is next week we'll really get our gear back together second down and four is Adams carries the ball line and Michael Brooks number 94 makes the tackle Michael Brooks we've talked about him they they consider him one of the best sophomore linebackers in the country of course Cornelius Bennett of Alabama is another one both of those kind of out of the Lawrence Taylor mold and I guess when you think about a prototype at the outside linebacker now you're gonna think about a Lawrence Taylor or a Hugh Greene who we saw of course during his playing days the University of Pittsburgh their data rate getting to the 9 yard line Cornell bourbon stock more from right here Lexington Kentucky preferably the bright spot of the day for Kentucky has been the passing of Dooley fernell Burbidge is running what has been the most effective tax cut for them in the second half it's a hook or curl in the ball is right on the numbers Julie amazingly now 9 of 11 in the passing Department for a hundred and five yards hot hand for this man and on first down Higgs carries to the fiveyard line and you can well imagine also lien what they'll start talking about tomorrow is who's gonna be the starting quarterback next week for Kentucky you go where the kiddo just came in where do you go back to Ransdell who got you to five and oh that's a decision that that man right there Jerry Claybourne is gonna have to ponder because Kevin Dulli has been impressive today he seems to have a little bit more zip on his passes than Ramsdale second and goal ball at the 5yard line good protection making the catch on a bullet hey he just made of what a starting spot next Saturday with this performance first collegiate touchdown for Eric pitch number 83 but but but a penalty in every game hit number 83 a little weave little move to the outside he's working on Norman Jefferson number 12 beats Jefferson to the inside turns back the ball is high and on the numbers and his concentration is good and all for not too bad he as we had a penalty ineligible receiver downfield offense loss of down you know Claiborne is saying you know how can that be ineligible receiver downfield that this seems very unlikely because with pocket passing who would be the ineligible receiver and not only that when the ball is at the 10yard line how many guys are you gonna send downfield are we gonna send them 87 Oliver white that's that's a call I don't know that I've ever seen a call for it in all this before receiver downfield when the ball was inside the 10yard line never gain a seven on the last play and so it's now fourth down timeout is called by Kentucky as they trying to move the ball into the end zone it stops the clot 6:47 crowd of 55,000 has thinned to about 15 right now his dual detox it over with the UK staff 647 to go in the game and it's to the Bengal tigers leading by 26 in my line of work your insurance is not a piece of paper it's up here and

you LSU on time 36 to 10 as Kentucky has the ball at the 3 yard line fourth down and goal to go with Dooley the quarterback faking hey were rolling to his left throwing and having an intercepted in the end zone picked off by Norm Jefferson number 12 Dorman Jefferson who was beaten a moment ago by Eric bit this time stepped in front of Cornell Burbidge number 82 and came up with a key interception so Claybourne has just watched his team have a touchdown nullified by a penalty Olli should have run that ball yeah Juli had an opportunity there to run that ball into the end zone little bit more experience any runs in it maybe the next time live and learn a little bit Powell isn't a quarterback meanwhile a Sam Martin now carries the ball after the 39 yard line he fumbles and Kentucky gets the ball back Russell Hairston number six jumps on that ball again he's been busy today Wildcats get the ball right back Sam Martin had some Running Room there now I had two more turnovers what do we have now George 14 turnovers in the game eight and six 14 turnovers what was the 19 penalties Sam Martin on an off tackle play he's got Running Room up here he gets in full stride right about here makes the cut to the inside the ball is stripped and Russell Hairston number six grabs the football Dooley he throws and that's incomplete intended for a cornell burr bag second down young Hairston goodlooking youngster he's come to play today and he will hit you somebody somebody's gonna think you're serious second down at the 39 yard line it goes away and white has it taken out of his hands okay si time here's Jeff how this happened moments ago in the snow at Colorado Springs BYU leaving Air Force 27:25 Air Force going for a twopoint conversion to tie the game Brigham Young has defended against seven two point tribes this year and just as in that case they have stopped every one of them BYU still leading 27 25 in pursuit of the 18th straight win back to Al Michaels Wow game in Colorado Springs wild weather out there multiple fronts third down and 10 from the 39 yard line sack of Kevin Dulli is turned in by number 97 County class fourth down coming up now five minutes and 55 seconds remaining to be played in the game LSU has things well in hand Tigers will be 200 in one in conference play and they will be five on one going into their big intersectional meeting with Notre Dame at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge next Saturday Kentucky meanwhile will brace for the invasion of the Georgia Bulldogs who put a lot of points on the board today Kentucky will be 5 and 1 going into the game and on fourth down Dooley and then incomplete intended for a wheeler they turn it over on downs and LSU will take over but he did indeed show some escape dimension there and I think that's one of the things that pro scouts like to look at that doesn't mean that you have to scramble all the way it simply means that you can make a move to get out of trouble reset scan the field throw downfield such as Dooley did that time there are the remaining games for the Tigers Notre Dame in Mississippi coming up backtoback at home and at Alabama at Mississippi State wrap it up with d'Alene this is the freshman Sam white remind you in a way of a couple of years ago when you think back mentioned that Jerry Stovall the ex coach had sort of a rollercoaster career two years ago that team was seven oh and one when they went into Starkville and lost a Mississippi State they were to lose another game that year and then lose a Titan one in the Orange Bowl in Nebraska and last year they were four and seven that was the end of the Stovall reign they brought an orange bar here's another they're back people down in Louisiana were pretty upset last year figuring the team had a lot more talent than four and seven Jon batiste carries the ball out to the 50 yard line oh it's a good reminder because in 1983 some of the preseason polls have picked LSU as the top team in the country and Jerry Stovall by one national magazine that features a lot of pretty girls in it was picked as the coach of the year well some of the picks have been really crazy now I love you know our guy vino cook one of our colleagues who works on our college football scoreboard beyond those as much about football as anybody but he's got me very excited this year in preseason when he picked my alma mater Arizona State is number one I got very excited until I picked up the paper after the first game of the season saw the Arizona State had been beaten by Oklahoma State 45 three well they're now listed in the bottom of pan they are they launched a cow also a few other fellows picked pit is number one earlier this season newsletter called the Klein report with the Panther yes number one so it's funny how things can can turn around in a hurry George Hill who does a great job with us statistically every week for that do it at the University of Washington he picked the Huskies number one and he's a genius big as they are well at least I'm I played my freshman season at the University of Washington and have been a husky fan myself James is finally getting some of the recognition that he is deserved for a long time me laughs achieved we have a pedophile unfortunately like conduct I guess what we're trying to say is that forecasting is kind of a dangerous game it is pretty much like the weather horse hard to pick up in at the 37 Lynn Holt number 87 the wide receiver who's quite a freshman prospect for them 511 175 pounds out of Miami and they're very high on him talking to Bob broadhead today having a little bite to eat before the show Bob said that he's a great prospect third down a third down and 20 from the 36yard line and incomplete what amounted to incidental contact right there between Carmichael Caldwell ain't one hole take another Pig here's the end of the play well I think normally you'd see a hanky about right about now but I think to say this pot burned out on anchor shoot see see that that to me with the interference normally that was duck Powell who threw that ball and he's a big strong arm quarterback six to 200 out of Houston Texas there's Parker field littered a 29yard line by pitch and that's where Kentucky will take possession of the ball after a 34yard punt three minutes and 57 seconds remaining to be played in the game I mentioned Bob broad had a moment ago he of course is the man who hired Phil aren't sparker mentioned that they had worked together first down new quarterback is Ransdell who comes back in and he completes it to assist O'Brien okay let's go to Jim Lampley again al there is a wild game going on in Morgantown West Virginia this happened moments ago less than five minutes to play John gay West Virginia running back sweeping left went into the end zone on to fourth quarter touchdown the Mountaineers now lead BC 2125 doubt what food is all about back to you al hmm upset right there but it's in Morgantown so it's not that much of an upset ready even though bc's ranked fourth in the country Adams takes the pass and goes out of bounds out of the 45 yard line with three minutes and 43 seconds remaining in the game Kevin Dulli took a little something off that ball as he throws one of the thinking duck patterns actually it's a Ransdell ran back in there yep trying to win the job back I'm not so sure the way hey here's that pensive wildcat that you talked about early still very pensive yeah maybe coming up there with a gadget play now if they stick him to the fundamentals Logan and he gets to the 39 yard line that pensive miss their boredom I made a little bit of both but a lot of frustration too very much summing up the feeling of the fans here you know what's sort of refreshing it's it's funny because you get around the country and what's what's happened a lot lately is that people are like our bullying teams that are undefeated if they don't have a particularly good day you see it in all kinds of stadiums all kinds of sports as the passes dropped by Oliver white you've grown so used to it it's almost a case of what have you done for me lately to the credit of the fans here anyway their team has had a dastardly afternoon and yet the behaviors been terrific and the bullying has been pretty minimal and what they're pretty much saying you say you know there were five and own you people have played well you had a bad day but we're not gonna pounce on you for it well it is refreshing it is it really you don't see it too much anymore these everybody's got the television mentality now they watch everybody else around the country booing and then they begin to pick it up in their hometown just go Bryant the catch and he's brought down one of the reasons they're not going right now is that nobody's here it's basically referring to what was taking place early in the third period when the place was full you know it's also refreshing this is the first Keith I think I've been doing seven months where they haven't had the wave congratulations to Lexington it's great well you said during the baseball playoffs there wasn't so much where the wave started but where it would ended maybe it has ended here in Lexington confessed could be it this could be the place Burbage think we've seen enough of the wave profile 243 remaining that might be the story of the game it's the termination or the way that we had that's right everybody's trying to take credit for where it was born this is where it ended and you were there first down at the 16yard line right still giving it to Adams Adams goes to the ten and we can take a clause here five seconds to allow our local stations to identify themselves second down and four from the ten yard line is Ryan's bills brought them back again look this time it is number 11 carrier of Louisiana State Chris carrier a freshman who makes his first career interception Chris carrier Chris carrier a freshman safety man who is 65 200 pounds makes a leaping onehanded interception right there that's an exceptional play by the youngster get some acknowledge but along the sideline 9 turnovers down 9 of them count for Kentucky from the 20yard line 52 to play in the game Samboy freshman running back and it'll be second down and a flag on the play well it's good to see the refs have been consistent throughout today well George what do we have here we've got 15 turnovers in the game and if you can calculate the penalties for us we can get a final accounting here because that's that's pretty much been the story of the tempo of the game dead ball file personal foul personal foul on Louisiana State played it down over first and 20 now you got Mike DeWitt as they go to the number three quarterback Mike the wit a sophomore Sam Martin again Timon it's tough to get any flakes on in that backfield because you've got Hillier teams who was hurt today and then somebody like John Gotti's three of those could play as well Sam Martin you just have to take advantage of every opportunity you can and I'm just wait for the other guys to graduate he's blocked a little playing time today and he's got some good yard yeah little experience straight ahead that's John back teeth after 23 yard line he goes final minute of plays the clock ticks down in Lexington Kentucky and in a non artistic game LSU will come out the winner by Kentucky they want to get the ball back one more time and so they stopped the clock with 26 seconds remaining to be played of the game Tigers will be five on one under bill Arne Frager and Jerry claybournes troops would try to regroup feeling was coming into this game but this would really be the first true test for Kentucky in a way yeah you can say well they failed it and they did I mean they they didn't play well at all today but you got to think that the team is a little bit better than they proved that I am they may have fought him down I mean after a five and old starts the best since 1950 they just really came up flat today I got to think least it's a better team and they've done it well I said earlier I felt that the game turned in the third quarter there was a tornado by LSU in the third quarter think this really whipped around and it was never the same team after that clay Parker to do the funding and the barefoot kicker gets off to pretty good on here thanks Isaac 29 yard line and 41 Kentucky time for a play or two and that will wrap things up here at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington LSU penalized eight times today for 71 yards Kentucky 13 times for 77 yards so we had today 15 turnovers and 21 penalties in the game brand elves pump fakes rolling throwing and that's complete his tight end Oliver white and he is dragged down and time mercifully has expired for the Wildcats says Bill Lawrence Parker couple across the field the secon Jerry Claiborne his team remains unbeaten oh and one in the conference 500 and one overall Tigers will fly back to Baton Rouge as victors here hello again everybody I'm Ken Anderson and welcome to week number seven of the Billy Brewer show the Ole Miss rebels against the instate rival Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles well the rebels have really had a tough time with the close games this year Saturday's 1310 lost the southern was the Rebs third close loss in a row Auburn Georgia USM and if you look at the score is in those three games plus the Arkansas tide and you'll find that only 17 points separate the rebels from three three and one two being undefeated at seven and oh but you know maybe the main difference in three 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 &amp; O lies in what Coach Brewer told the players Saturday after the game in the locker room he said simple enough you've got to play the whole game not just a quarter not just a half you got to play the whole 60 minutes coach Brewer didn't think the rebels did that against the Golden Eagles and certainly no excuse but still maybe the reason may be that the team was a bit mentally drained after the two emotional losses to Auburn and Georgia the emotional dreams Auburn in Georgia did you feel like there might be a letdown in this game yeah you know we we did and our kids handle is by somewhere that you know I really think we say we play well against all year long it's with exception of the Louisiana Tech ballgame and it's difficult for a football team right now we don't have the applicability to the push should hang there and it's it's a real mental drain now final stats against southern Golden Eagles won the battle on the ground they rush for 203 yards and the rebels ran for 127 Nathan ronsley by the way led the Rebs with 77 yards in the air Ole Miss of the edge quarterback Ken Austin past for 143 yards compared the USM to 128 so in total offense the Rebs finished the day with 270 yards to Southern's 331 Ole Miss had a slight advantage in first downs 15 to 13 and defensively tackle Benton Reed led the charge with seven tackles that was six solo and one assist and fuzzy Huddleston and Dan Boise were next with six apiece so that's the picture of the game stay tuned all the highlights and interviews coming up next on the Billy Brewers soon so Billy Brewer show is brought to you by Bryan food cocacola Lennox air conditioning hilemon Gold side and this asipi chemical the Ole Miss concert singers at the prestigious Chester Music Festival in Great Britain Ole Miss is awarded for the best choral performance we talked a lot at Ole Miss about the pursuit of excellence the choirs is a pursuit of that and I'm proud of that and I think the song goes well we are for you Ole Miss up in New York the number one blowing is optimized in Chicago tomorrow's number one yes Oscar Meyer here's the number one Bologna from the north whichever they've tried to beat us for years we beat them maybe that's because you can't get a damn home base what's so special about all this oh I think it's the people and the lovely campus the mystique Ole Miss to me was everything a university should be and more you know do you fellow Ole Miss fans it's up to you to continue the Ole Miss tradition of excellence whether it's on the football field or in the classroom so support the campaign for Ole Miss Saturday was the rebels first visit to Jackson's Memorial Stadium this year and despite the threat of rain 51,000 Mississippi it's turned out to witness the instinct battle rebels took the opening kick and Nathan ones league got the column six straight plays the juniors started the drive with seven yards over the right side here then it's option left once Lee takes the pitch from quarterback Ken Austin and breaks through pretend yards down to the USM 47 yard line two plays later Austin with the playaction fake rolls right in fires the flanker James Harbor on the Kuril back covered 11 yards next two plays lose five yards so it's third and 15 get Rose right Smuts tied in Mario Perry but not enough for the first down on the reception so it's fourth and seven up coming Fred Brewer comes in for the front but it's a fake the snap goes to pull back off the Humphry he can only get three though Reds failed to convert we're playing well but we don't have we didn't have the real zip and that's that's the mental part of it you know us we're tired mentally which you're tired mentally you can't get a whole lot going physically on Southern's first possession Robert Becker that quarterback and sophomore Vincent Alexander starting at tailback Alexander takes the pitch and ones for 17 yards before Barry will burn and Howard Moss pulling down but the rebel defense soon puts a halt to this Drive and it's Howard Moss again that makes sure boss drops Ducksworth for a nine yard loss the freshman playing more and more every game well I'm just mainly trying you know I'm trying to I'm looking for a start position but you know I just get to play and I'm just trying to help out you know if we can win in a way I can't I want to help out anyway so the rebels retake control at the 31 option left and Kent
