============================================================

that's the story at halftime Super Bowl 19 it's the San Francisco 49ers 28 the Miami Dolphins 16 and you have to believe there's a little bit of mine searching going on now in the Dolphins dressing room Dan Marino has not had the kind of success he had over the course of the year you can either say that maybe Dan Marino is not throwing the ball as well or perhaps it is just great defensive play on the part of the 49ers they have also been a couple of plays that have played a major role in this first half and here to discuss that one of my colleagues Don Meredith along with his sidekick Joe 5:00 on a pair of quarterbacks do they ever agree on anything well I agree that's costly you look at the first half that what appeared to be a fumble and yet was calling it complete bass certainly could have been a swing in the other way cuz San Cisco did go ahead and score a touchdown and of course the fumble right before the half which you know they get this offenses offensive lamb attacked at a block boy you forget until I mean not supposed to run with the ball but Miami could have gone in 15 points down instead of 12 points so now we're talking about two touchdowns their back is back in the ballgame totally makes a big difference for them they've got the momentum back they scored right at the end of the half they took a nice twominute drill down got three points and all of a sudden they get a break you've got the offensive lineman handling the ball ideally when you kick the football on the ground like that that's exactly what you want to do you want to have somebody who hasn't handled it before maybe you'll put it on the ground for you and bang you wind up they really wind up with one point less if they scored a touchdown yeah John Nolan when we did your game with the 49ers early in the season you guys dropped behind early in the ballgame and yet came back to lay the heck of a ballgame what did you guys try to do what have you seen this first app that you might try to do say you're trying to play San Francisco and Maryna and ketchup I think what dan Marino is gonna have to do is what they started out in this football game doing that's throw the football come out possibly don't go to a huddle make the 49er defense try and catch up with him they're a fast strike fast move offense what happens is you want the defense to play your game I think they're gonna have to put the football I think dan has not played well this first half I think he can play a lot better but you know and then looking at Joe Montana soon I think Joe's done a really good first half and I'm not terribly surprised that anything they've done but I've seen him make just some individual plays some reaction plays that everybody you know could have been a loss he's pulled out a game picked up a first down here first down there games like this boiled down to individual great efforts whether it's the great defensive play like we saw Hicks make maybe it's the Carter knocking the ball loose with a fumble recovery by Jensen or just the great individual efforts as Joe Montana has shown the whole half I look for Dan Marino to come back out feel a lot more comfortable and say thank goodness the first pass over now I can get back into it I also think as we see damn arena they're on the sideline I don't know what the heck they've told him is different hey Dennis get some more points on the board he certainly wants you to see his stats the 17 out of 20 783 yards one touchdown no interceptions I know you and I talked earlier we thought that possibly that the 49ers might have put a little bit more pressure on him and maybe picked off one or two about what they've done is they bounced him around a little bit and that tends a quarterback to start looking over his shoulder I think they forced him just a little bit out of his rhythm he likes to sit back in the pocket he will take a little bit longer than normal but it's not quite the same when you're in this kind of a football game I can't believe that a guy 23 years old in four months can't feel the pressure of this kind of a game all right wait you know what I kind of like to know is I was in a locker room with this guy a little bit what do you think coach Landry that Sheila was telling these guys in that in that locker room at half that Oh of course you never saw more of a psychological swing in 30 seconds if you see it saw at the end of the half both Walsh and Sheila had to reprogram what they were going to say but sure had to have a lift he had to go in there and say man we're back in the ball game all you have to do is get back on our game plan play the way you played all year and we'll be back into this game again ghost do you think that he was popped to try to change anything I mean he came in with his game plan of course it's you do you usually change something at halftime or just say hey let's do what we were supposed to do a little bit better I don't think he's gonna change a lot I think it's hurting a little bit right now is there not run the ball at all and actually the 49ers were playing before a fourman rush there third down defense all the time and they're just gonna have to throw the ball idan they're gonna have to beat it you know we've made a couple of comments and you were sorry no better than maybe I do you think that the 49ers were changing up it looks to me that maybe they've got Johnson and and Brett Dean spread a little bit wider than ordinarily they would be does that have an effect you think yeah we talked about it early I think we all anticipated that that's what we're gonna do and after the first quarter they've left their threeman line completely they've come in now with Dean they come in with Gary Johnson they've come in with car they come in they're all there for best pass rushers and they're gonna play them that way until they run the football again coach Landry do you feel like you're gonna say something to Dan Marino if your Don Shula they have time and say look Dan just settle down let your teammates work for you do you don't have to win this football game for us we can do it ourselves oh I think that's true go you you're a quarterback you know exactly what the what needs to be said in that situation dan Marino is facing problem for the first time some unsuccess and that's new to him I think he's capable to come back and put them back in the game it's gonna be a whole new ball game I think so let's go to Oh Frank let's get this thing kicked up right who better to bring the dolphin back than this man Dan Marino he passed for over 5,000 yards on the season set for NFL records most touchdown passes most three hundred yard games with nine most four hundred yard games before and on the outside still to be heard from in a major way our Mark Clayton Marc duper they are the only pair of receivers ever to gain over 1,300 yards for a team in the history of the NFL and if there ever is a team that you know can come back it is a team as explosive as the Miami Dolphin we're set to go the second half again the 49ers beating 28 to 16 awaiting the kicker brave beause it Walker out over the 25 to the 26 yard line we I don't think we'll see any dramatic changes even with the score being what it is because the Miami offense is and come back offense they open the game that way so out comes Dan Marino let credit great defensive play on the part of the 49ers in the first half so we'll see what is transpired in the locker rooms as the Miami Dolphins except for their first possession the two setbacks Tony Nathan 22 woody Bennett and the 34 mark plate of course 83 mark Cooper 85 in the tight hand bruised heart first outages Nathan single setback coming from the offside blame board there will be a loss of about a yard of the clay make it a couple it'll be second down and 12 and plane board really is the heart of that defensive line he has played so well over the years the leading pass rusher for the 49ers look at this pursuit well the team's speed what he does is the entire defense turns it back into that backside pursuit bore it makes the hit really he hit him from behind you'd even try and tackle and they just ran him back into him second of long yardage looking man is open and Senator Mark Clayton and Moreno has been under throwing throughout the game and throwing behind he's storing behind the brakes growing late bird Emma lemon now for Dan Marino that was a second down blade that we just saw in San Francisco at their fifth defensive back in there I think I'm watching them first that Joe they've changed up a little bit folks all the Blazers but they got the extra backs in there right now expecting that fast turn left by Don Shula situation I got six packs in there and the sock is made at the 15yard line and again merino actually had time to get that ball off the good coverage downfield by the secondary of the 49ers that was the six pack offense with one lap back at the linebackers Tina Turner but you'll see board that's what he's been doing he's the he's the guy that this Frank mentioned he's gonna be back in there close to the quarterback and out comes Reggie Roby on fourth down who is not as not kicked well today at all he has been short he has been unable to get the ball to turn over he is not getting the height that we are accustomed to watching from north so the 49ers are in good shape to have fine field position once again as Dana McLemore is at his own 38 yard line we'll take it near the 40 good mental margin over the 45 to the 47 yard line that was a 46yard effort with the 7 yard return this peplum was down there quickly for the Dolphins nevertheless 49ers after good field position if you run a small business profits can get squeezed when inventory doesn't match up with production what you need is a tool for modern times behind be an personal computer not only could it help you plan ahead it'll balance your books and give you more time to make dough and the cost that's the icing on the cake your own IBM personal computer try to distort your you Nissan 300zx turbo you know the car but do you know what is like to drive it now you know once you get inside a Zia see you will get inside of you it's your dancin dealer not necessarily trivia because it could play an important role in this game I might point out something else in Super Bowl competition no team that has ever fallen behind by more than seven points has ever come back to win it here we go first down at 10 to 49ers baby 2816 where about to be sacked kills it with the incompletion Charles Bowser was there let's take a look at the stats from the first quarter first and you can see San Francisco had already started to dominate there in yardage and time of possession and then we'll switch them over to halftime for you this became a 49er second quarter you look at that second quarter with the 9 yards rushing for Miami and gave him a big job second down and 10 from there 42 what bro Fontana windows Tyler and you'll have a first down inside thirtyeight Flynn Blackwood on the tsop 14yard pickup that's the Big Dipper so far I think he has made those plays when he has yeah it's not a design drop back at all he just forces the defense to do things here you see him he gets outside puts the ball up Wendell Tyler camps right in a good spot makes the defense come up and play him turns around in you've got yourself another first down San Francisco is just taking control of the football and they're not going to give it up Fontana hot hand 14 of my team a hundred and eighty yards two touchdowns he's run for 40 our first encounter cameras his way into the 35yard line gain of about three good reaction on the part of the Miami defense hmm here that that one thing Miami's defense does they have great pursuit those bees get all over the football field here you'll see the play action if bowers was gonna move to the right he sees it now he's getting back for the reverse now you're doing a great Russ Francis doing a great job of trying to run him outside he fights off the block comes back inside Miami has been susceptible to reverses throughout the course of seasons 34 yard line second down and six again bring running stays on his feet for the first down near the 27 yard line rather innovative little motion play they're sending that most defenses would possibly suspect a fast but he came back with a little counter move to Wendell that's I hate to think about it Wendell Tyler of course has had problems throughout his career with the fumbles 13 times this season nevertheless he moved through the playoffs against the Giants without and the Chicago Bears without a bobble and he gets the first down for the Niners Derrick Harmon the rookie from Cornell we played Tanna can before long time but good coverage by the dolphin defenders that pass intended for Mike Wilson and good coverage by Don McNeil the corner of action well I think you could see Montana though move there was he was trying to say hey no turn and go back half a little bit quicker there that outside he was not terribly pleased with the fast better that was run there's the brain trust on the sidelines Dan Marino and that of course is Don struck the veteran quarterback who's been such a help in the development of young Dan Marino picked it up no joke looking for our first downhill have it out at the 16yard line on a 12 yard pickup at Joe Montana where dreams of not only is it a good bank for them to pick up the first down but I think another thing is how frustrating this must be for Miami's defense when hey they rush and he's not there and he gets away you could still pick up his first down Joe's an exceptional runner there you see he gets flushed out of the pocket this is not a design playa not a design run and he has tremendous presence steps in and steps out got himself another first down welcome to Super Bowl record for quarterbacks grunting he had 60 are he that's the printout of bucking about a windmill Tyler if the Hammers in the wild Blackwood whenever the last drops him after a pickup of a yard while hit Wendell high also buddy had a little better luck with Wendell than he did with Russ Francis in the first ahead I would say give away a few pounds might have a little more luck that's right hey bring up second down and nine Carl Monroe comes in number 32 now secondyear man out of Utah the little return man of 5/8 166 pounds he joins Roger Craig as setbacks first five minutes of a half they're so critical coming back into the ball game splits out left Dwight Clark he comes down with a great concentration short of the first down that he's near the 10yard line a third down and four look like he just dropped it right in the bucket to meet Charlie Bowser had pretty good coverage if there's one pass I think that is the mark of a truly great quarterback and this is it right here e you're gonna see the coverage of Bowser has Montana dropping back he's working this side all the way he sets up gets a great little loft on the ball and look at that thing land right in there Gus drains got a touch there not have been more perfectly thrown nevertheless short of the first down it'll be third down white plus with to get into rest Frances he was we'll bring up fourth down and out will convert ray worship to bring out the field goal team Wersching let the NFL with 131 points had a good season 2535 and he is three or five in postseason play we have 10 15 remaining in the third quarter fog has settled back in but deferring might have been put up around this other ancient stadium there on cherry pickers outside during in 27 yard attempt and Wersching is good return of the kickoff which resulted gonna lastsecond field goal for the Dolphins before the half I played on some great teams but today I'm in a different arena business for how you manage information can mean winning or losing that's why thousands of companies with IBM mainframes and personal computers used color net software with cullinan software a company can control information and pass it a persontoperson so everyone can work as a team okay everybody smile me and the crew we've taken this road across Alaska look at the last frontiers different when his roads finished and it's on the Left we can say we did that it's for guys like TJ taunted you that we make every bud wiser the best it can be beechwood aged and brewed with the kind of pride TJ puts into his work so TJ and all you guys out there like him this budget the 49ers put the first points of the second half on the board they now these 31 16 and golden Walker is back at the three yard line awaiting the kickoff of Ray were she as five field goals in Super Bowl play that is a Super Bowl record rush yet four for four and Tannehill hit at the thirties falls over the 32 the 31 where they'll be first down Miami and a reminder ABC's Super Sunday will continue right through the evening with the premiere of a special new series insurance it Magruder and loud after our Super Bowl coverage and outcome Dan Marino you don't want to belabor a point but Dan has got to take control of this thing now he's 15 points down and he's just got to settle down and put a good drive together this is a similar situation to where he was before they have you've got to get some points on the board listening what you say I'm not trying to do it all by himself why not five plates and plates short of the first down our mother Tony Nathan out of the backfield gets to the 39 yard line Gil gets eight out of that it'll be second down and two and again as we watched in the first half there will be no honey those two things defense can change on I knew it was hobo who came to this team was passed here to help shore up that defensive unit from the Seattle Seahawks former UCLA great watch him he's working against the probowl bound black stephenson number 57 and he beats him to the outside he gets a little help from the other side also Frank and that was Roy foster although kind of knocked him off Stevenson let it go my new didn't though he got the sack Moreno half time once again for completion he just could not find the receiver later in trouble again Bexhill goes out again this time Blayne born they may have found a nice combination with the six defensive backs and one linebacker as we mentioned earlier that again Tina Turner is the lab back of the remains in the eternal pick four guys loose tickets for the Super Bowl they distributed throughout the entire country but here in the San Francisco area we're hearing from a loud partisan 49ers group of fans leaving the green to do something with port he did not do enough and the punting unit is on at the 22yard line read zero beyond the punch Moby has mapped kick to his regular season form over at Macklemore takes it to 25 and that's what happens when you put it high get the distance you get the coverage downfield the 49ers will have possession they'll be inside their own 30 yard line you can hear it it is a partisan 49er crowd only 59.99 for this Nissan truck and you're telling me no other leading standard compact has more horsepower 59.99 more standard payload to $59.99 double walls 5speed 59.99 same sticker prices last year more truck for no more money that's what I've been trying to tell you

turn your work into garbage from sharp Minds come sharp product tonight how come Magruder Jenny loved cops by day lovers at night meet a very special couple MacGruder in love tonight right after Super Bowl 19 color in pageantry they're all parts of Super Bowl activities 49ers first down a tenth of all of their own 30 yard line and scored on the play of a possession don't Montana is having a hot evening once again 110 Tyler oh that really was he didn't break Friday and then ball was right there they can 40yard pick up on a little checkoff pass over the medal here he makes the blue action thank the Tyler he looks down there he's really trying to get the ball up the field but he has such great time and ability to move inside Tyler makes a great play now is when he starts to become very effective bounces off of Glenn Blackwood and continues down the field forces Lyle will make another tackle that's a nice little span that he had there when he got it around Brophy first and 10 Montana 16 of 24 226 yards wide open with a 17yard another 49er first out of old delay for us that time way to divert to clear out the linebackers to make their move and then he slips right on through in the middle you see him in motion I don't block watch him stopping out here for a minute as if he's gonna block nobody comes he says oh ok I see a big okay and there it is this is the Bill Walsh offense and nobody could be better being a perfect extension of it then Joe Montana they worked so well together first down 17 yard line this is inaudible Jenna rise Roger Craig out of the backfield the crowd booing what they thought was happened pass interference on the part of fruits in ski but it was not can't the fault him one way or another our V did have a good crossing pattern a little bit deeper that time and it was Russ Francis once more who had gone across I guess the thing on Bob is he supposed to little bit stronger against the runt and you see him that temp doing a heck of a job with his pass well he strung his right hand he was strong against the line that's easy when you do it that way second intent that was good right Clark good left flags fly West Frances shaking his head we've had few penalties if you were not with us from the start of the game here's our referee Pat Haggerty Clark number 81 as Frances just a little eager the great athlete Russ Francis six years up in New England great years they were to retired in 1981 came to the 49ers 1982 for a first round pick fourth John blocker and a very reliable receiver Oh although six years second down 15 and it's a lot of scrimmage of that's it he is covered well there by bombproof in ski hut will bring up third down and 15 another third down and 10 as ball is advanced to the original line of scrimmage version is not well rushing getting ready on the sidelines we saw earlier Montana down here throw the ball away and take the kill go when you've got a 31 16 lead you want to be sure that you does just don't turn it over and give the other team the opportunity to have a good field position bring it back Crossing the middle from 16 yards out on third and 10 Sabich Keith born Hurst come in there heesu there he is brilliant ever to score three touchdowns in a soup fortyniners offensive unit is and their defenses frustrating afternoon for the Dolphins and head coach Don Shula they seemingly can do anything they wish merci 18 remaining in the and now San Francisco opens up a 38:16 lead I can relate to this situation being this far behind down here down here in the we call it the plus 20 area are close to the other teams gold you'll see this is where Miami's tries to play a lot of mantoman defense there goes Blackwood crossing with the back break comes underneath his linebacker got caught in the mesh and runs in unten Roger Craig Joe Montana a great offensive line doing a number on the Miami Dolphin will be back Stanford Stadium in a moment Crow Wing Minnesota an Old Milwaukee host means something great to these guys he means a great beer cold Chris hold the long beer light security keep an Old Milwaukee light taste is great is there you know doesn't get any better than this this new Nissan is being delivered to the Watson estate can you tell who ordered it here are some clues it's America's bestselling import room five front wheel drive surprising performance it's the Nissan Sentra so affordable anyone could have done it even the button at your dad Cindy Lee the endurance event that started it all a grueling survival test over 140 miles swimming biking and running the Ironman triathlon World Championship on ABC's Wide World of Sports Saturday a 70yard 49 year drive was called native of a 16 yard touchdown pass to this man Roger Craig think back a 40 yard pickup was Montana to win bill Tyler Bolton Walker he's been back there a lot today settles in at the to and rain where she kicks away football against to the 33yard line let's go to Tom Landry and take a look at that Fontana the window Tyler pass that covered 40 yards ok they have a great fake here the thing is killing Miami right now is they're not getting any pass rush on the play you see this fake coming in there Montana now you see caller coming into play is downfield here's Tyler right here because of no pass rush at all he's able to beat his defensive linebacker and make the big play see him fold and there he dished around and Montana has all the time in the world to pick him up so there's no problem at all I almost broke it all the way Wendell Tyler you can run the football he is also a fine receiver there's an injured 49er on the field and out comes the trainer's the medical staff of the 49ers Todd shell now we will get a positive identification of the 49er ing it's number 90 Todd shell when they're working on and will be returning to Stanford Stadium in Stanford California in just a moment look you don't the best review system you if the monitor is made by one company for printer by another the plaza by a third that's great but what do you do about service easy choose your system at computer Lee our worldwide system protection plan assured you that everything will work or we'll fix it we fix it right here after all it can't be the best system for you if it doesn't work computer lab the one thing to know about there is hot gel the rookie from Brigham Young they're still working on top shell on the sidelines we will get a report as quickly as we can Dolph is out trailing 38 16 6:11 remaining in the third quarter have a first and ten the ball just outside their 33 yard down linemen freedom and if there's a game that's less than a yard take a look at this pouring drive again it started at the 30yard line the big black line well that's Wendell time 40 yard pickup yellow of course it is the penalty no runs and with that touchdown the 49ers have tied the Super Bowl record for most points of course by the Raiders a year ago against the Washington Redskins thank you very much sorry about that job okay second down and nine on the shotgun the quest they come with it was able to get it to Joe Rose he's short of the first down up to the 42 yard line Jeff Fuller was on a safety blitz and you can see Moreno trying to point to the referee said hey he's hitting me late he's hitting me late there you go as the graphic result you didn't play defense so did you Joe no I did buddy I gave up one in it that contributed I can tell you that I'm glad we're not only at the top in that particular category that was the merino that we have watched all year under great pressure he still was able to flick it and get the completion now he needs to for the first time and it's complete and it goes to mark Clayton anyway we'll have the first down inside the 43 yard line of the 49ers there he comes down you'll see Clayton's just gonna run about an eight yard post pattern breaks inside Carlin Williams moves on the outside the ball is still being thrown low he makes a nice catch all day dan's had a little bit of trouble getting the ball up all day and it's running at a time you think Matt Moore around right the proper route that bad he was pretty close in late night first and 10 43 yard line the 40 2:32 the 27yard line before he has taken down by homo another 49er miscue in the middle oh I've got a fake when Miami looks up and sees look the 60 visit backs in there they're clean we've got to run this ball some way and I think that's true they've got it get on out of that defense this all 57 Dwight Stevenson with in the middle Brina looking for Clayton he was well covered by Eric right to send complete certainly a little more frustration seemingly for mr. Marino yes we have seen earlier than you yeah he has attended people say he has a tendency to try and force the ball in on that particular play he did try and force that's that little pattern they used where they run the outside people down about five yards into the quick post they run the tight end or the halfback out into the slap nap time he tried to make something happen he's got to settle it down you're down 3816 you may as well just wing it Don Shula puts in for wide receiver that's more Jimmy supple oh they joined mark plate and mark duper across the fields Moreno lucky for six the one who made the crow he is our best defensive back and he made a great play against Mark Clayton the terrific play Eric right stepped inside grant the eyes of Mark Clayton look back there it was and it is has been a tough day I think that picture said it all just throwing your hands up almost in despair seek lake tries to go up top right gets a handle he's actually trailing him a little bit plate guns gonna try and go back for the ball that's just a great defensive play into the eyes of Clayton in that mantoman coverage read the ball was about there and comes down with it could you say that that ball was a yard or two underthrown or was it just a terrific defensive move job I would have to say it was a terrific defensive move and if the ball had been thrown a little bit further he might not intercept it it might've just knocks it down 49ers first down with her own oneyard really Mark Brown to made the defensive unit of these dolphins with his strength against the run there is Eric Wright again he made the Pro Bowl as an alternate when Mark Haynes of the New York Giants injured late in the season could not report so he will be joining his teammates Dwight hips Carlton Williamson and Ronnie Lott in the Pro Bowl a week from today which will be bringing you right here on ABC as will this man Joe Montana he will direct the NFC Marino will direct the AFC second down Roger Craig spots the first down marker and he gets it again a reminder tomorrow once ABC News live coverage of the negation of President Ronald Reagan and join Peter Jenny David Brinkley and the people of ABC News for reaction from around the nation and the world 85 at 11:00 a.m. eastern time on ABC and I've already told you this limit weather in the nation's capital they will move the ceremonies inside and the parade has been canceled but we will be there with coverage Greg did not get the first down as they marked it short at the 11 yard line so let's third down and short this is an area sometimes where the 49ers may try and a little bit of different put the ball down feet sank it's up to dick ready Solomon and yard playaction it held everyone Salomon was open feeding loud black wood first down 49ers and nothing they do doesn't work today it's obvious Bill Walsh is not going to just sit on a lead he's going to continue to be the aggressor another playaction fake to Wendell Tyler Joe looks out to the flat first buddy's coming across the middle good play no pressure on him that time I saw Freddy Solomon come in late to the huddle so is the last fan decision by walls to do that the Goodman brilliant game plan for Bill walks into the day's game everything works on first now and pray to the 30yard line he'll get six it'll be second down and four we're running out of time in the third quarter 150 in the clock is moving certainly a wellplayed game few flags few turnovers and this man has absolutely been marvelous everything he has done has been to perfection one of the things they've remarked about Joe Montana is his ability to bring himself up to the occasion of the football game there's no question he's playing as great as any quarterback has played in any Super Bowl mr. dick five wide receivers in the ballgame Roger Craig follows Windell Thailand to the 40yard line another 49er first down and while Blackwood and Glenn Blackwood are making most of the tackles and that's not good when you're playing safety position and Lao is slaying right now it's not good because these guys are getting such a head start there they're running at me he still hit him a little bit high so I think you got to drop it down just a little bit just for his own sake he's gonna start have to hit no come here while the Bruce brothers as they're known will be the Bruce brothers by the time this game is over they have made so many tackles in that secondary first and 10 the minors at their 40yard line this is another place where the 49ers like to take a shot surest Francis another white Clark right Clark the game of seven yards don't quite way to catch five or six full of gauge for the game's over I think that's his third reception see their third plus two is five yeah mine is running out of the third quarter in the 49ers are going to let it run out early 38:16 and the 49ers team saluted by a crowd of 85,000 here at Stanford Stadium Peter Jennings experience sets him apart overseas the best journalist of the three anchorman at the Olympics a splendid intelligent choice on politics better than rather or Brokaw I think the best thing that can ever be said about

effort suck him down and floor first down circle forward he'll get it as he moves into dolphin territory and that is the 27th first down for the 49ers as they are working now on yet another record we're going to pause five seconds to allow our stations to identify themselves Wyoming's ke T wo television to kiss her Miami Dolphins opened the scoring of the Super Bowl 19 49ers took the lead at 7 3 with Montana the 33 yard touchdown pass to Carl Monroe she sought back and forth first and ten Wendell Tyler loses his footing and falls at the line of scrimmage take a look at the stats from halftime there's a big second quarter for the 49ers and then we will fold that open through the third quarter for you the only turnover Frank was the fumble that we saw right before halftime the 49ers haven't sloped we look at this 444 yards is a lot ERT with nearly a full quarter remaining to be played and Wendell Tyler was slipped on that play limps off the field Gary Carmen the rookie from Cornell the ninth round immediately he works to the 46 yard line for a gain of a couple in the arms of crowd off third down long yardage Joe Montana as they work on Wendell tired I will tell you the report on Todd shell that who left the field injured earlier is that he has an injured ankle and probably will not be back when Delilah looks like he's got himself a cramp sometimes that happens the guys are there really fast get prints because they have muscles it's good go third down and eight deep drop by Montana tried to get it to Dwight Clark there was a diving attempt at the interception by Cosmo Lake Park Montana kept it out of his reach work done I will see max run occur we haven't seen him for a long time there's max roediger spent a lot of years with the Philadelphia Eagles before this is only his second pot and that goes all the way back for the first quarter of the ballgame that's the kind of offensive show the 49ers have been putting on thanagar hangs it high looking for the coverage and Walker dances out over the 20 to the 22 yard line before Earl Cooper makes the stop and there is Todd shell there working on that left ankle the rookie from Brigham Young we'll be back in Stanford in just of all you're looking at a prime example of the new forward thinking at Ford a family sedan conceived and created to change your thinking about family sedans it's named Ford Tempo with frontwheel drive for surefooted traction it's a family sedan that doesn't look or act like one but wheel drive Ford temple the forwardthinking cloud have you driven the best built American cars have you driven a Ford lately my agent needed a zoom copier naturally he didn't want to spend a lot so he got the Knowles's compact painted 350z when I get a rave review he makes great big copies and I get a smallminded review he makes little tiny copies and it's easy to get any size in between and in a variety of colors of course I don't save my reviews my agent wants them I want I don't want them the new beta 350z zoom copier at a very small price only from the mind of manova the San Francisco 49ers are the only team in Super Bowl history to stop their opponent on four downs inside their own 5yard line they did it to the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 16 holding Pete Johnson to no gain on fourth down from the one the stats for Dan Marino others that's marked uber has one reception for the game mark Clayton has five before only 65 yards and they combined over the season 444 receptions and over 2600 yards first down and 10 Miami 12:45 remaining in the game without them down 38 16 the ball just out over the 20 yard line in deep trouble again Gary Johnson in there just putting the hands on merino oh they're going after the fourman line has been so effective for the 49ers records falling all over the place most yards San Francisco 459 yards and we have over 12 minutes remaining the loss is all the way back to the 8 yard line second down and 22 and this is the first time in the young career of Dan Marino that he has been sacked four times fightin good effort I don't know 35 to the 36 for a Miami first down to put position on your pickup it's a good decision by Miami to move Marino out of the pocket he has not had the success in the pocket you would expect him to be a dropback passer so what he does he drops back now he's committed himself to half the football field but he gets away from the big pass rush he does have good mobility not great but good clayton does a super job coming back for the ball and turns up field gets the first down no huddle offense once again on first down Moreno fires off the shot getting it to mark Cooper crying he was covered by Eric right very well but there was pressure once again on Marino Eric right in his fourth year out of Missouri had just a great year as I mentioned heading to the Pro Bowl as an alternate because of the injury to the Giants Marc gains that he was funny when ronnie Lott heard he was going to the Pro Bowl he said I'm gonna give my spot to Eric right he's been our best defensive back whole year he says he can't do that though Ronnie and appreciate it though yeah second down the ball just inside the 36 yard line on the Miami Dolphins and a worry Don Shula complete to cephalo as upload will have another dolphin first down up close to midfield Jeff fuller made the stop a 13yard pickup again no this worked well for them early in the game now they have come back to it defense for making changes Breno almost the spectacular catch by Matt Moore but he can't hold on it'll be second and ten the only difference between of using that offense right now at this point in the ballgame and earlier in the ballgame earlier in the ballgame San Francisco was not equipped to put the six defensive backs in Zen they were in the quick huddle now that's all they're playing the six defensive back so it's really not as much a help to Miami as it would have been early as it was really in the football game I really think only lamb Packer we've seen and second half has been Tina Turner but he's the only one it's yes so they've certainly they said hey we've got a lead because you're gonna beat us you gotta be the six guys back here and keen to turn their plays I'd like a defensive back a slight line back under great pressure for him this pressure on Marino Tina Turner was coming also Jim Stuckey who is in now as one of the four down linemen Jeff fuller came from the other side they put a little blitz in there you can bring those backs up they line pretty close line up pretty close to the line of scrimmage and then all of a sudden they changed it up and they go very Rhino has broken one records Super Bowl pass attempts 38 they came to pro they have been growing unfortunately the 49ers defense has just been superb today third down and ten mark Platon overthrown and Ronnie one was right there really the key because they're not sagging him they're always his face he's been sacked four times but he's been hit many more times than that it just really throws off the rhythm of a quarterback to have to constantly move around the pocket just to make the throw there you see he just can't quite set his feet the way he wants to of course the picture speaks for itself what happens after Freddie Dean's in the heck of a job of shaking loose Roy and Foster were there line of scrimmage and out comes Reggie Brophy innocent Dana McLemore who settle down at the 10yard line regi seem to been able to get back in stride at a 47yard effort hesitation in my of America gentlemen it's really strange Joe is I've just looked willing to go then for for fall coming in and I just thought he kicked that one almost up to the top of the stadium had to come down with a little ice on it came home little eyes oh there was no hesitation he he seems to come off the foot and he called for a fair catch he bounced it off the knee and this Heflin was there and the Miami Dolphins get a break they'll have a first of ten at the 21 yard line of the 49ers 10:52 remaining the 49ers with a commanding 3816 lead let's open the defense again he keeps going down ah said Williamson another Pro Bowl xlix or defensive back marino just desperately trying to throw that into the end zone and williamson look right there he tried to force that one in what happened was the receiver went all the way to the sideline started to come back Williamson read it had worked right back to where the football was I would think that somewhere about now you start giving Bill loss tremendous credit for the game play and they're forcing Dan Marino to do something we haven't seen him do all year and Don Shula has gone on record said hey we're gonna do what we did that had got us here so they may have changed a little bit so Bill Walsh has done a heck of a job we'll be back in just a moment IBM presents you make the call Vince Ferragamo of the Rams passes to tight end Mike barber who touches a knee down at the 2 and stretches his arms and hands as far as possible to the goal line now you make the call is this a touchdown when things are out of control a simple solution is the personal computer software in IBM's assistance series start by entering facts and figures into filing assistance then move the facts around to work up a plan or draw the graph there's writing assistant to help you handle words and reporting assistant to pull everything together the assistant series from IBM getting all your ducks in a row has never been easier what call did you make the ball should be spotted at the position the ball occupies when the runners knee touches the ground spot the ball at the oneyard line Carlton Williamson one of the finding the seat backs in that secondary for the 49ers just coming down with the interception and on his way that the probe all went to school with Dan Marino they were there together Pittsburgh 49ers first down with Ted then back inside and gets out close to the 25yard line four or five yard pickup most people would think of Bill Walsh now he's gonna sit on the 15point lead with ten minutes to go he's sort of deep in his own and he doesn't want to make any mistakes but he just has continued to stay with this game plan he's got his plays listed on that folded up piece of paper under his arm and he's just gonna keep throwing him at the Miami defense make him stoppable bill walls coach collegiately right here at Stanford for two years in 77 and 78 for lying to the 49ers has given a great deal of pleasure what's transpiring today let's go quickly to Tom Landry so basically if you think this happened to us right now is it the second half San Francisco stay with their fourman rush they stay with their third down defense Miami has been unable to penetrate it they haven't slowed down that rush either by running draws or screens and therefore they just gained the confidence to the point where they've almost run greps an understatement but certainly right on the surprises for one defense has been so effective against the Miami office Tyler opposed to the 40yard line six yards thick up there before Kimbo camper was able to make the stop the wind will get up again he went off earlier with cramps both legs and it appears that if you get one early you're gonna have a no but more than likely he keeps getting a little bit cooler and a little bit cooler that's right you're now looking at Roger Craig's right knee today Roger Craig has had 44 yards on ten attempts very he passed reception yet another 49er first down as the seconds tick off the clock 8:25 and it continued as the move one statistic we've come up with is another indication of what's happening while Blackwood has had 11 tackles today and he placed safety so they're running the ball rather well it's the one thing that San Francisco felt like they had to do whether they were gonna do it early and set the temple on the football game or set it late to try and control it to keep the ball away from Moreno it didn't matter they still were gonna have to run the football at some point and obviously now is the right time they have a second best offense to Miami in the NFL they crummy that's all that'll be second in 10 remind you saturday on ABC's Wide World of Sports it's the Ironman Triathlon World Championships see these courageous athletes they swim they pack and they run over 140 miles in a single day in the premier event of this kind of the world all beginning at 4:30 eastern Pacific 3:30 Central Saturday right here on ABC the rages is just one edge of it that you for the tribute to the Ironman race a hundred and forty yards I could think of another hundred forty miles that word on Roger Craig is that he like Wendell Tyler has perhaps of the legs and he'll be back second in town Dwight Clark waiting that's in a great position on him Dwight Clark went up for tennis six floor that pals dead roommates off and on as they've been here pedalo trying to get a little blitz Marc Brown comes in there the ball just laid up he says dy go get it look at that concentration but like Clark where do those magnets are supposed to do the reverse angle a little bit better look at is Frank Minton it's terrific cut governs there but Jetson comes back bounces off his nose twice and he's got it as they're just right in the first thing is inside the 22 yard line of the Miami Dolphins playaction by Montana he he looks and who is saying I finally must watch each song he did slip it a little bit too far it looked like Freddy's maybe he has Muslim Gramps also this thing if that's a muscle cramp we've had so much of it today and this field is in spectacular condition his formula grass is cut to about threequarters of an inch and the bill walls told us the other day is perhaps the finest football field in the entire nation that's what he thinks of it that's what oj said he'd played on it he likes to play there well they've just been doing a lot of running tonight and I've is awfully chilly and damp out here I feel like the temperature change has a lot to do with it they come out the beginning the ball game the real warm their muscles are all loose they come to the sideline they sit a little bit and then you work in and out of the football game and you can't help but have your mothers constrict a little bit Stanford Stadium this past summer was the site for the soccer preliminaries in the Olympic competition they have tremendous prize there's wonder rest Francis Francis will be closed for the first half I think he's about a half yard short take a look at it from the field level you can see the fogs already kind of settled down into the co but they're doing a little crisscross in there actually Charles Bowser was even late getting on the field that was very close to being a little one bouncer but I'm sure he held onto it third down and about a yard Tony Nathan smiling on the bench for the Miami Dolphins midway in the first quarter over the top the number 49a pushdown 540 in the clock continues to move his muscle cramps were gone was in the backfield there the big offensive guard Bill Walsh has used him in that backfield weighs 270 pounds he's a little bigger than Wendell Tyler's considerably bigger and he is a fine the lead blocker and another record has fallen another one to Joe Montana darling all over the place they've really put on a terrific show particularly offensively and you've got to give that defense regular credit come here play against Miami Roger Craig is living up to what OJ said in our pregame show he could be the man such a key factor again this time he struggled inside the ten close to the eight the gain of a couple to bring up second down and eight Doug Feder is defensively there for Miami I think another key that we touched on earlier in the pregame show was we expected the secondary of Sam Sisko to be a real key but I didn't really expect him to bring two more guys out there they helped set those four guys that are Pro Bowl bound play we really concentrated on the four defects as it turns out we had all the other people out there playing whips the oline when you're all alone and blue yeah that's why them to tell you troubles too that's that's it there'll be many great games for that young man to come up second eight chuckles down close to the 5yard line to bring up third down and six Charles Bowser oh stop forget tonight tonight for the premiere of a special new ABC series and that's a good one Magruder in LA we see it after our Super Bowl coverage will stay with us here on Super Bowl Sunday on ABC's Eddie DeBartolo the owner of the 49 suits down there already congratulating that's Ronnie Lott allpro cornerback that they've all played great on this strong running by Roger spray down to the two yard line short of the first down in the arms of Mike Charles enough coach Walsh has a decision to make here it is fourth down do you want to go for it leaving the football down deeper do you want to kick and take the three points okay go for it make a touchdown what I think bill I think he's gonna go for it I could leave out one option that's true you can't go for the touchdown I think he's go ahead yeah all right now 38 16 310 remaining and the clock moving they will keep the offensive unit on the field on 4th down a little more than a yard to go for a first about two yards for the touchdown great as 83 yards that was not a mark of solomon tips Miami Miami Dolphins will get the ball back I have to 46 now sense of respectability possibly Jeffy's about saluting Joe Montana as well they should Hey Brophy the injured Miami Dolphin rookie from Miami of Florida he was looking for two championships of course he played on the national championship team a year ago by the second round draft pick he was in hopes of the first player to play the national championship in college and super bowl champion the following year such will not be the case give me a like if you just ask for a light beer you never know what you'll get give me your lights so if you want the list fill in light beer with the first name and taste don't just ask for a like Oh

very empty feeling you almost get to a point where you say gosh you just don't want to get here and lose it if you can come here it seems like you should win it not lose it the emptiness is tremendous Miami first down and 10 the ball at their own two yard line Joe rose and row sort of the first down but he moves it out to the 10 yard line it'll be second down and three again no huddle the Dolphins have three timeouts I was doing the 49ers this time the first down over the 15 to the 17 you don't rain need puddles when you're just gonna say you guys block booth but you can somebody get home cuz we're definitely gonna throw they'll have to hurry to beat the twominute warning they get it off firing underneath and that bore through the 25yard line two yards short of the first down and the twominute warning is sounded we'll be back at the stadium in just a moment you begin with Ross steel shape it with fire muscle and sweat polish it to razorsharp reflection we're looking for a few good

shotgun once again no huddle max max run eager the putter for the 49ers Julie had a great opportunity to watch a game to this Maryna good coverage once again over the corner by Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and Brando has to fire it out of bounds it's fight of it all in spite of today for Dan Marino what a great year he's had most touchdown passes fortyeight regular season 55 through the playoffs in 18 games most yards game 5,084 most passes completed 362 most 300 yard games with nine most 400 yard games before those are all NFL records for young Dan Marino and his first Super Bowl will be lost On January 23rd Appleton control will announce the Macintosh office you can look into it or even go on his business as usual there could have been little doubt that Joe Montana would be the most valuable player and he is now one too MVP awards and superbowl competition of course he won in Super Bowls 16 in the win over Cincinnati and he joins a couple of other great players Terry Bradshaw and Bart Starr as other Super Bowl quarterbacks who won that MVP award twice what a day 24 35 331 yards three touchdowns great running Moreno third down and four Tony nation gets another

is a beautiful wonderful city to visit another Miami first down seconds tick off for the 1984 season office came in to the game with wins over Seattle in Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship game they dominated totally in the playoffs 49s Moreno loses the ball moving away from the center within comers final seconds ticking away depends upon how you look at was it the lack of offense and defense by Miami or was just really in play on the part of the offensive unit of the 49ers Super Bowl 19 is in the record though who became a head coach so late in life Cincinnati San Diego Oakland and then collegiate Leah Stanford measures of the players Loki makes a great deal of personal interest in his players Ceramics enough imagination to office perhaps the other coach has in this game I think offensively and defensively and no one really expected this Don Shula team to score me 16 points and I think Don should be the first to admit their highest scoring team during the season in the 1984 Miami Dolphins were just incredible they rolled up 513 points on the season but they met their match today against the San Francisco 49ers to play this game almost water put me back a Stamper stadium

today total domination as they led 28 16 at the half wind up wanting the game the final score 38 to 16 the 38 points a Super Bowl record along with a 38 scored last year by the Los Angeles Raiders against Washington there is Commissioner Pete Rozelle Joe Montana the MVP of Super Bowl 19 in your picture right now Montana's setting a new passing yardage record and after it looked like the Dolphins had worked their way back into the game through a big break at the end of the first half they were shut out in the second half and as we welcome you back to Stanford shortly we'll be going into the locker room for interviews i'm al michaels joined by Tom Landry and Tom what strikes me is with all of the offensive output of the 49ers how about a defense that allows only one touchdown in three playoff games what can you say about it was just a tremendous performance the 49ers were just dominant in every way we talked a great deal about the fourman rush that we felt they were going to go to and they did they went in with Dean they went in with Johnson they went in with Carter and board in the second court and it changed completely the game Miami was unable to move the ball against them of that was the difference sometimes you have to let a little bit of time pass before you relate this team to others in the past but this is a team that came within three points of a perfect season are they one of the best teams in recent history in your mind I think they're one of the best teams that I've seen in a similar basis I think the Pittsburgh Steelers they're Green Bay Packers and all of them are confident to this team and they really perform well I just was very impressed with them today all right right now let's go down to the locker room and Jim Lampley all right now we are here in the victorious dressing room of the San Francisco for do the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy here again Commissioner Pete Rozelle well bill and Eddie has been a long road since July you probably know a lot better than I do if you come up with your two for two to Super Bowl wins the last four years there's a set a record of becoming the first team regular and postseason to win 18 games and really your entire organization is be credited your organization area that you put together the bill is Cochise outstanding coaching staff in certain to these players so it's a real number you played on the day it's a great performance credit to the entire organization and certainly are going to be a factor in the future here's the trophy P Thank You mr. hat DeBartolo jr. the owner of the San Francisco 49ers guys I love you coach Walsh this staff we're the best we are the best and we will continue to be the best I'm just I'm just very proud of everything that we put together through coach Walsh and his organization commissioner thank you this trophy belongs to Bill Walsh his assistant coaches our organization and these great players to play for us my pals gentlemen in the midst of this celebration we are expecting to be connected electronically with a visitor from the east as a matter of fact right now coach Walsh and mr. DeBartolo I believe we're going to be hearing from President Reagan coach Walsh there ought to be a bigger word than congratulations for all that we saw tonight and what you and that team of yours have accomplished but that's the word to use and I just want to say congratulations to you and of course congratulations to you Joe Montana for is being picked and for the performance but for all of that team I guess there's a coach you couldn't have asked for anything greater than they and they gave you tonight well yes well I tell you they've given it all year mr. president this is the greatest football team in the greatest group of people I've ever been around and I hope we've added to today's festivities you certainly did and you know if now that the season is over and you thought us having anything to do for a while I have to go up on the hill and deal with Congress in a few days how would you like to come back and I could use a front line for well I think we'll stick to football mr. president your equip for your job will just try to deal with this win congratulation to you on your election we're all behind you and we're praying for you thank you very much and again god bless you all and it was just great all right thank you very much mr. president for your participation and now gentlemen if you can stick with me just a second let's discuss the particulars this game first of all at DeBartolo I want to congratulate you on having won this for the second time in four years thanks Joe it's a real honor that's it's a gratification towards this great team that we have alright hopefully we'll get a chance to chat a little bit more later on right now I need to chat with Bill Walsh if I can coach Walsh if you can come over here congratulations on your second Super Bowl victory I wonder if you knew after all the detail work and the preparation and the buildup for this game that it was going to turn out to be potentially as decisive as it was well we did the best we could we planned we've got a lot of confidence in this football team and you never really know I was a little haunted by the fact I was wondering if we could even score that's what happens to you before a game but once it started and once this team went into motion that just a great group of football players I think that's one of the best teams of all time were you at all annoyed or bothered and did you suspect that maybe Joe Montana would be especially motivated by the degree of attention that's been paid particularly here in the Bay Area to Marino in the past couple of weeks well Marino is a great quarterback great young quarterback Montana to me and my feeling and our team's feeling is the greatest quarterback in football today maybe of all time and this was Montana's year Verena will certainly have his years he's a great football player but this was the San Francisco 49er year and we had a lot of competition throughout the season we met a great Miami team but without doubt this is the greatest football team in football today first team in the history of the National Football League to win 18 games during the course of the long season did you ever worry from week to week about your team's motivation in the face of all the success they're experienced know if that's the strength of the ballclub we were basically motivated for every game we played with the same intensity play after play throughout the season and this was typical of it this is the best game I believe we played we were ready for it and I just can't say enough about the resourcefulness of all 49 players because all of them contributed coach it's always a pleasure to talk to you congratulations again you've once again squelch rumors that you might be moving upstairs and giving up the coaching duties so we'll look forward to seeing continued success for you in the years ahead thank you very much we'll be back with more Super Bowl postgame right after this Super Bowl 19 is being brought to you by the new co it's not a car it's a Volkswagen and by IBM when IBM personal computer owners look for good software where can they turn to IBM for programs that help you keep up with modern times business programs entertainment productivity education and more the variety you want with the quality you expect in the growing library of IBM personal computer software a well balanced selection at a store near you mrs.

fine line between life and death partners 24 hours a day right after the postgame show back again now with the most valuable player of Super Bowl 19 and the third man to win the award twice in his career wonder if you know that you've joined Bart Starr and Terry Bradshaw now having won the award twice and congratulations thanks I appreciate I tell you though I have to say one thing about our offensive line did one heck of a job all day long and allowed me to do all those things that that happened today and gave me the time that was necessary were you particularly motivated coming into the game by all the attention that was paid to your opposite number in the last couple of weeks Dan Marino I think I'm ho offensive you it was all we heard all week long was Miami's offense how you gonna stop them and I think deep inside of us nothing was said but inside of each of us we just knew that we had an offense to and no one was thinking about having to stop us so I think we were out the proof Center all right Joe you had a great game throwing the ball and a particularly good game as is often the case running with the football let's take a look now at some of the action which was critical during the course of the game here's the first touchdown to Monroe that's just a roll out and trying to get the halfback down to the corner chop with the clear on the X and he just broke a tackle there got in the end zone alright now we're gonna look at your touchdown run well trying to throw slanted Dwight the guy jumped up underneath the butt and it was a big hole in front of me I just ran did you have a feeling before the game that you would be scrambling out of the pocket a great deal against this defense well it wasn't so much the pressure aspect though it was just a they recover and drop a lot of people back I felt that we could get the fire nothing was open I could get up inside and run much better game today than in the six preceding weeks what do you attribute that to well I think we just executed when we got down inside the 20yard line the past couple games I I've given up a couple touchdowns and throw an interception and cost us some points this week we just went in and wanting to fill the ball and get inside and get in the end zone yeah big play here by Wendell Tyler you had all day to wait for him to break free well we were trying to throw the ball the outside receivers and kid told me all day long he'd been covered on this play so we got back to and I looked back inside was looking for the tight end all sudden he was stand there by himself and he makes a great run after the catch here's the third touchdown by Roger Craig what a game he had he sure did Rogers here is one on one with the linebackers moves him to the outside then goes inside of him here and then just splits a guy to get in the end zone here oh this was the second touchdown that was a they had been blitzing and trying to cover our backs with their linebackers one on one they did it the first time we came back with the play the second time in a row and there was no one around ROG one of the prices of Fame Joe great deal has been written about your personal life in the last year or two are you a happier and more content man at this time than in the recent preceding times well I definitely am and Jennifer has a lot to do with that and she's been behind me the whole way and giving me the support that I've needed and I couldn't done it without her all right let's take a look at one more play and this one will illustrate the kind of protection you got from an offensive line that's sending three players to the Pro Bowl and from which I guess you expect this kind of help oh definitely they've had a great year all year long and you know they've just been underestimated even not even this year but the past few years and now finally they're getting what's doing all right congratulations once again Joe Montana the second Super Bowl championship still relatively early in your career we'll look forward to more big things from you in the future Jim Lampley in the 49er dressing room the next man up is Eric Wright who played a sensational game against Mark Clayton and Mark Cooper as did your running mate Ronnie Lott a cornerback a lot of people wondered how you guys would do handling Clayton and do per head up you were he highly motivated by all that speculation the first half and then throughout the week the whole secondary we knew we would be the key to beating these guys and it was going to be determined on what type of day we had we had a super day back there our offensive good any mortals guy they came through when we needed them interception that prevented a touchdown a great catch we're gonna look at that play right now Eric can you describe it for us well if the tape rolls we'll look at the play I seem to have lost the monitor down here so we'll wait to see exactly what happens at any rate what happened on the play was that you were able to leap in the air and take a ball away from Clayton kind of play he's been making all year oh yeah he's been coming up with the great catch all year and I was a type of pattern that he wouldn't normally make that kid but I got a good piece of at the line of scrimmage and that enabled me to come back for the ball and I came back to the ball very aggressive normally I would knock that ball down but I had to come up with a pick and that I turned the game around those guys had momentum rolled in their way all right Eric congratulations to you we've got some other players here whom we hope to get a chance to talk to later right now let's go to OJ Simpson with Don Shula coach and I know this must be a difficult time for you but I'm sure you'll find some consolation in the fact that you have a young football team and it appears that they're gonna be here quite often in years to come but defensively your defense never seemed to get into the game today well Montana had an awful lot to do with that he just was outstanding in every way every time that we seemed to have some kind of pressure on him he scrambled and made big plays on his own or he scrambled and bought time and then hit one of the receivers crossing and he just knew what to do with the football the entire day he just heard us in every way running and throwing a football broke the records and did a great job when you get beat the way that we got beat you take your hat off to the victor and that's what I'll do Bill Walsh did a great job with that football team and our team didn't rise to the occasion our offense played the poorest game that has played all year long we just didn't make enough plays our punter didn't get the job done when we had the opportunity to get some field position and defensively we never stopped them Montana and their final offensive line or two running backs or receivers that's a heck of an offensive football team and we didn't have the answers even before the 49ers start putting so much pressure on Marino he had a little trouble throwing the football and as you mentioned the punter Roby had a little difficulty punting the ball do you think the thicket air something had something to do with that well I'd like to make all kinds of excuses but we're not going to we just didn't do it our punter is supposed to be the best punter and he didn't punt like the best punter today and Marino had some problems but he's had a great year the thing that we can't let happen to us is get dragged down by this and discourage so we got to think about the great things that happened to this young football team this year the accomplishments we earned the right to be here the 49ers the best team the best record ever and the National Football League and they're the they're the best well I agree with you you have an excellent young football team and we expect to see you here many times in the years to come in now we're gonna go back to Al Michaels all right Oh Jade so at Stanford Stadium the 49ers win it decisively final score 38 to 16 and our postgame coverage of Super Bowl 19 will continue after this for Mike Blum international consultant headaches come with the territory

pregame hype centering around people like Dan Marino and Joe Montana so no surprise at all at Montana at a big day but there was also an unlikely hero the number two running back but a man who led the team in receptions this year and let's go back to the pregame show this is what OJ Simpson said before the game about Roger Craig when you look at the 49ers running game only Chicago and the LA Rams I've had a more uh you know more yardage game running the ball this year and I think with Craig and Tyler especially Craig I think he may be an unsung hero and now here is Roger Craig celebrating in the 49 a dressing room OJ Simpson suggested before the ballgame you could be a key factor here I got to tell you Frank Gifford has been saying since midseason that he thought you'd be the difference in the Super Bowl did you have an inkling coming in that you were going to play as big a role in this game as you did well all year they've been using me as offer of his back and a type of defense Miami runs that they power come to me quite a bit like I'm Swing Out passes and uh quick draws and things like that and everything worked out well for me today the offensive line did a great job of blocking and uh everyone just executed very well we're looking at some plays here in a moment some of the action in which you excelled during this game right now the viewers are seeing the touchdown pass you caught from Joe Montana early in the ballgame the one that made it 14 to 10 pretty remarkable to reflect that you caught only 16 passes in four years at Nebraska could you ever have thought that you had become the receiver you have in the pros well in the browser that they never really uh you know passed that much their run or a 10 team but they had a lot of success with the run there so there was no necessary need for it but you know plan for the 49ers I had to prepare myself Farzin catching ball because they are they passed quite a bit to the half backs come out of backfield so it was a lot of hard work and a lot of concentration and and I had a lot of help from selling players on team like Freddy Salomon and Dwight Clark those guys helping out quite a bit when I first got here viewers have now seen your touchdown run that made it 28 to 10 now they're looking at the last touchdown pass that you caught from Joe Montana made it 38 16 did the team have a sense that Montana was gonna come up big today well Joe I always come up with the clutch player every game you know he he's that type of a quarterback and on top of flair he's a leader on our team and we have a lot of confidence in him and he just performed well you know every time he's on the field and on that play you know he just read the defense very well and saw the eye was open and dumped off to me all's I do is just take it up the middle all right thanks again Roger and congratulations on a big game today if the gentlemen in the truck will indulge me one quick word with Carlton Williamson who played with danny moreno at pittsburgh and came up with an interception today your pressure in the second half seemed to really bother danny moreno had you thought that that might happen well we felt that that would be the key to the ball game to us winning the ball game and talked to Danny after the game he was telling me that he feels fine physically and he mention the fact that the pressure on ER was tremendous every thought that was gonna be the key all right well we're gonna take a look now Carlton that your interception on the back line of the endzone this was a ball that Dan really put up for grabs yes that was one of the things that he'd been doing all season and a lot of defenders would get hurt because they wouldn't look around for the ball I have excellent coverage so when I'm in is all I try to look around and find the ball especially when you feel his comment and that was the case I just turned around to try to find what a ball was and it was already in in air so I guess he was trying to get rid of it and I was on the receiving end at this time knowing him as you do any note of sympathy for Dan yes there is the guy's an excellent quarterback and it was a stuff formed the way they had to lose today but this is a competitive sports competitive game and he'll be back Carleton congratulations to you and all the defenders here and we'll be returning with more postgame coverage from Super Bowl 19 immediately after these messages don't believe everything you hear about the revolutionary new Volkswagen Jetta the rumors about its roominess the exaggerations about its German

comments from the guys who called it from the booth and let's go upstairs to frank different frank thank you very much I'll dog Meredith no thighs but once again I'd like to congratulate all the 49ers I'd like to congratulate the Miami Dolphin still you don't go 14 and do it not be a great football team and I'd like to congratulate another team we have on over 200 people here providing the coverage of Super Bowl 19 we certainly hope you've enjoyed we certainly hope you've enjoyed a very very busy year for all of us Don Frank I really I enjoy the ballgame it was maybe not as close as we had expected but I thought it was a fun game I would just suck at your congratulations to both teams I was really happy to be part of this this was kind of fun big deal out here I liked it and Joe I'm working with you thank you was a lot of fun both working with both of you and if you I guess you can't be on the field this is the best place to be and I just think it was the type of football game we all expected not quite as much defense really as the 49ers put out there to shut down the Miami offense as they did but I just think they couldn't have asked for any more in this particular type of football game and I want to thank both you for letting the rookie in and having an opportunity to learn and observe such a wonderful contest it ain't easy being easy and smart quite so much of you know it doesn't quite hurt as much all right right now we're going to be returning to Al Michaels we hope you enjoyed our coverage all right Frank well one man he didn't call it on the head but he did figure it would be a 49 or Victor a lot of points would be scored let's get the closing comments from OJ Simpson who by the way down to the Dolphin locker room Dan Marino has declined to be interviewed on our postgame show he did attempt to get him your closing thought so Jake well al I think it was simply a case of a young talented football team going against a more experienced of well balanced football team like it's apparent that this offseason Don Shula is going to have to shore up this defensive unit of his and try to get a running game to go along with Marino duper and a Clayton 49ers well it's a team that's at the top of their game and I for one wouldn't be surprised to see these two teams playing in the Super Bowl again next year all right Oh Jan I want to get a closing word from Tom Landry I'm just struck by the fact that the operative word in the NFL over the past couple of years has been parody what kind of parody is there when a team goes a team in one and wins the Super Bowl by 22 they're pretty good I don't think we had any parody this year I think the fort knives were the best team and they proved it you know the lot was been written about this game before it happens but somebody has to step out on the field somebody has to win it and the 49ers did so whatever is written about them they deserve san francisco's Super Bowl champions winning
