============================================================

to go with Michele Tafoya well coach you started the season oh and for but since then have won five of your last seven what have been the significant factors behind that turnaround I just think the single of focus of the guys just having the ability to zero in on the challenge of the week and and and void out the noise as obvious is a lot of noise but it comes with the kind of start that we have but they've done a nice job but just being Billie tough this is Steelers Ravens and in recent history is to be our guide this will be decided by a field goal or less how does the winning team generate an edge in this game you know you don't deserve enough negativity early on I think that's kind of been what has marked the flow of these games we got to avoid some negativity obviously we've got to make some plays down the stretch to the kicking game's gonna be big coach thank you thank you and the Steelers will be without starting defensive tackle Steve McClendon the knight missing his first game because of an ankle injury they'll also be without linebacker who's missing his third straight game with a cat issue but they do get back defensive end Brett Keisel who missed the last two games with plantar fasciitis all right Thank You Michelle the bearded one there he is number 99 Baltimore won the toss elects to defer Justin Tucker having a great year a very demonstrative kicker they kick off to Emanuel Sanders none of the Steeler wideouts in on this chilly night in Baltimore with a bouncing ball its fielded for yards in and Sanders will down it there let's take a look at the Pittsburgh star do Ben Roethlisberger Miami Redhawks lady I'm bill Michigan State will Johnson West Virginia Antonio Brown Central Michigan he bailed sandesh SMU Kate Miller Virginia Calvin Beecham Southern Methodist University Ramon foster synastry Fernando Velasco Jordan David de Castro Stanford Marcus Gilbert University for students of late have been using a lot of extra lineman six offensive lineman on occasion right now in a situation where as you can see you've got three line into the white in know she goes Jericho Khatri who has scored seven touchdowns issues you know the the rookie running back levy on Bell who was their number two draft ice at a Michigan State tackled by Haloti Ngata I think a loading on is feeling better right now right over the nose tackle just takes a swim move and gets in the backfield and when he is athletically active like that to go along with that huge size of his on the offensive line it's a reconstructed revamp Raven defense you know that Ray Lewis is retired it reads a lot of guys were gone from last year but they have really picked it up away the optimism around here to the outside and another reason for the optimism were plays like that ladarius weather gets him behind the line of scrimmage so two runs and a loss of two here third down and 12 banalakis Berger fifth career start at Baltimore Steelers in those starts averaging only eight but he's 2 &amp; 2 as a starter in this third down to the light Mongo's go so Queen runs for the rookie and then of course it's Pittsburgh in Baltimore so you'll see a lot of activity like that after the whistle tonight still trying to get the bunk piled fleet Blakeman and his drew will have their hands full we're a minute and a half into the game and we already have this I like it I hate to say it but this is what makes this game so great and it goes look at the hole in the middle here Ben saw it they stack everybody to the outside to try and get pressure so he goes okay I'm just gonna turn around and hand the thing off but in talking with Ben Roethlisberger last night and he said you'd see stuff like that Chris Canty sort of a mile drive and then a couple of shoves and the big guys get into it and we kind of got a Pittsburgh Baltimore game breaking out all over here happy holidays matt mcbride who was picked up in the middle of the season is the pittsburgh punter Jacoby Jones to return the kick and he is always at work big booming kick Joe answer was mine brings it back out to the 28 yard line tackled by antoine Blake and then let's take a look at the Baltimore offense Joe Flacco Delaware Ray Rice New Rochelle high school toys Smith Marilyn Jacoby Jones and mighty Lang Tigers small and Brown University of Georgia at Dixon Oregon Ducks Eugene Monroe University of Virginia take you Shipley Penn State Gino grant Kowski Delaware Marshall yonder Iowa Michael war University of Ole Miss so Baltimore all season long trying to get some running game going strong with play action and Franco going there's contact but there's no flag it's a little bit under thrown William Gay was there Jacoby Jones had beaten you but the ball hung and the pass is incomplete second time I tell you where the day got away with back into him to slow him down he knows he's beaten and then flips his head around the last minute so he doesn't get called for pass interference just a good veteran play William Gay was great last week probably got away with a little something on that one but you got to give him some credit a very intelligent player Ravens beat the Jets 9 to 3 here on Sunday the Jones scoring the only touchdown of the game play clock at one out of the pistol on second down in town to give it to Ray Rice unbelievably averaging less than three yards per carry tackled by Paulo Malo so Joe Flacco had a postseason for the ages he's terrific in this stadium 37 and 8 drafted in 2008 and started as a rookie he and John Harbaugh coming in together and he parlayed that offseason into a 120 million dollar contract and John Harbaugh has taken this team to the postseason in each of his years at the helm and at least one postseason win in every one of those seasons third and seven Flacco gets it away it's caught on the outside by Brandon and he asked enough for a first down one of the interesting parts about the Pittsburgh's defense now is their great play maker Troy Polamalu is now almost playing a linebacker position and dime defense and one of the things in talking to the Ravens about that is it takes him out a little bit of that xfactor role that he does so well where you just don't know where he's going to be back in it linebacker here again on Torrey Smith is made by Mike Taylor as we take a look at that Pittsburgh defense Cameron Hayward be Ohio State University Vicki hood Missouri Jason worlds lunchpail defense Lauren Stebbins Florida State Troy Polamalu University of Southern California Jarvis Jones Jordan a tsquare universe William Gay Lou Will Allen the state university Bryan Clark LSU Cortez Allen the Citadel like the Ravens a lot of changes with Pittsburgh no Jean cherish and OKC Hampton from last year and on second down there goes 55 yards so James on his first bomb have marked them a little short the crowd thinks he's into the end zone and now they're going to mark the ball of the oneyard line where this Allen makes the tackle take a look the safety in the middle appealed I believe it's will Allen comes up underneath this route and Ike Taylor who has been seeing a lot of receivers in the last couple of weeks go by him and they just take shots down the field it's exact same way they played the game last week and just came up with a lot of big plays and now the ball down to the one one official came in to signaling touchdown now this is a score and not a scoring play so you'd have to challenge it if bar ball wanted to he could challenge that it was a touchdown but instead he takes his chances on the first and this is Ray Rice who won't get there so it's going to be second down and goal well I'd say a Joe Flacco this is sort of the opposite of what we see around the National Football League with the Baltimore Ravens so many teams around the NFL now or throwing those little short quick passes all over the field in the quick screens and you'll see a lot of that from Pittsburgh tonight and Joe Flacco and the Ravens almost the opposite they just take it it's full of deep and take their chance five minutes into the game playaction Flacco dancing and he's going to get sacked back at the 7 yard line Jason worlds is there but he's really come on he's playing extremely well of late and that's going to make it third down and goal one of the things that they do in protections with Ray Rice is they expect him to be able to double Reed here and here and sometimes it gets them in trouble that time Jason worlds just beat him around the edge so that first down and goal from the one all of a sudden doesn't look so good I split rice wide to the right empty the backfield they go 5 wide on the third and goal closed car touchdown Torrey Smith this time it counts for sure so Dori Smith who looked as if he was in the first time spotted inside the one bar bar can smile right now otherwise he would have questions whether we should challenge that spot inside the one but it's all academic at the moment touchdown well Mike Taylor is going to be upset with this one because you see him waving his arms he started inside jumped to the outside basically telling Torrey Smith here you get a free release the inside because I have help in there the help did not help and they got in touch to Justin Tucker for the point anchors so the Ravens first drive 71 yards each plays on a third down to Smith for the TD a mouthwatering a little bit now if we love being out on Thanksgiving night doing the dares at all effort you do miss that turkey and we were stuck with Brussels sprouts but what are you gonna do okay so here we are in Baltimore and Thanksgiving night seven to nothing the Ravens on top the Ravens in this series the team that scores first is twenty seven and eight deck is fielded in the end zone as Justin Tucker fix to Emmanuel Sanders and Sanders brings it back to the 21 yard line before losing his helmet then goes back to work on Pittsburgh second drive when we come back I'm

for on social media good stuff on that site leaving seven to nothing well the 21yard this word series all three running close keep it on the ground again this is bill who they expect to develop into something very special let's take a look at the Baltimore defense Arthur Jones Syracuse University pumping out them or Chris Canty wahhoowah Courtney Upshaw gonna birthday all about Darrell Smith Georgia to Jamil McClay Sarah to hacksaw Paul saw our universe the Daria's will nickel state James D ed wrote University of Massachusetts Matt Elam Hawaiian high school Jimmy Smith University of Colorado first time these teams met pittsburgh was able to run the wall with great effectiveness a lot of heavy packages that started that way too you can make it five they're sticking to the same plan Le'Veon Bell and it's been a couple of years since Pittsburgh had a real Bell count on slapping or saying that but you know where I'm going with that second round pick out of Michigan State he was heard at the beginning of the season at 93 yards rushing against the Ravens back in week 7 and he is going to be their guy Mike Carlin long shot develop into something extremely special his partner willing to throw his first pass of the night and it's over the middle in his court getting away is Antonio Brown who leads the league in receptions that is his 81st of the season he was able to spin away from Lord Darius Webb and move the chains just coming right across the formation but you hit on it al Antonio Brown now leads the NFL in receptions had a monster year Mike Wallace of course goes off for huge money to the Miami Dolphins and for Antonio Brown it was up to him to fill that void now we get a little Wildcat going for the Pittsburgh Steelers it was not well maybe here comes it looked like Bell was going to take the snap Wildcat has been subject to a lot of talking ball the ball on the other side so Roethlisberger had flanked out then came in Chris Keith he is able to knock it down at six seven and that'll make it second down say it Ben Roethlisberger's one that ball tips straight up in the air watch can't he he's not even Russian he just playing that wherever the passing lane is and somehow that thing fell right in the middle about six guys Ravens used a lot of walk that last week on the other side as you look at subs with his sights set on raucous board the first walk out of buoyed by the Steelers in this town he spins around as Sanders the Sanders gets taken down at the 35 yard line but Cory Graham Todd Haley in his second year as the Pittsburgh offensive coordinator how many stories have been written about him then and you know Todd is saying it is so overdone it is so ridiculous what do you think I think they do all right I don't think he's Bruce Arians in the minds ben roethlisberger he's his dear friend and vacation home together somewhere close in Georgia but you all right it Leticia time at after those comments hi I'm Dan Rooney I'd like to thank God for our many blessings and ask him to bring world peace I am Art Rooney I'd like to wish our many fans around the world a Happy Thanksgiving as well as our servicemen and women around the world founding families and there they are and the the unthought to the left of your screen is art son Dan and Dan's grandson as the former ambassador to Ireland back in the states full time here the first flag of the game offside from the left side of the defensive line as Emmanuel Sanders can't hold on and gets hurt on the play Elvis do Merville was jumping offside it gave Pittsburgh a free play here's politte Blake beside defense number 58 in the neutral zone of the snap fiveyard penalty still third down boy this hurts on every level you get Sanders hurt but this is a freebie for an NFL receivers you get the offsides penalty so been rightly takes his shot and that is an easy catch that is not exactly a diving layout that's one he's going to make but he smacked his head on the ground I think we saw it sort of whipped down and I can tell you most of the tough concussionlike symptoms I had as a player go from exactly that your head somehow whipping onto the and conceive it took its toll bring Marcus Lee take his spot he's a work our state third round draft choice its third and two then a little shovel pass and that is caught by Jericho contrary having a great season been around a long time ten years a lot of those with the Jets but he scored seven touchdowns this year he's become like a second security blanket after Heath Miller for Ben like this play called watch Elvis do Merville he sees Ben coming out and he has to respect that dump it down to cotchery underneath clever play at the 46 Pittsburgh going nohuddle something they've been great effectiveness in recent weeks which helped turn their season around after that started on four in September got this down five Ravens both dressed in black tonight men in black taking care of my head a bow is the first to hit him second and nine now one of the matchups will watch tonight Kelvin Beecham the left tackle a guy who really has had to sort of fill in took over for Mike Adams and drill Suggs is the guy he's going to have to try and slow down in this no huddle they hope that at the very least the no huddle we're down some of these pass rushers cuz to the very best on the Baltimore Ravens the Steelers of Sandy's sex back in that commission just a couple of plays it's second down and which coming again where he gets it away that's bought by me the 41yard line goes the Venerable tightend Heath Miller in his ninth season in the league he was their number one draft choice back in Oh 5 and nearly a lot like Jason Witten I mean he's always there yeah and he's such a big part of it you know he's coming off the knee injury last year and he just seems to be getting a little healthier each week their MVP use the best player you know bullets left in the quarter the Ravens have had the ball once and lead seven to nothing and squirting through was bill nothing they were initially that he was able to turn no gain into a gain of about four second and six take a look at this the Ravens defense through week till first and sacks second best in third down conversions first in red zone defense and seventh in points allowed this is a team no Louis Louis ellaby getting rid of a lot of guys in southern touchdowns they gave up on opening since then only ten passing touchdowns in the ensuing after that nightmare in the Rockies and walkest burger go an incomplete good tight coverage on Antonio Brown by Corey gray who had two interceptions against the Jets three days ago good read by Ben you got the oneonone coverage in Antonio Brown at the end of this route watch him he kind of slows down to try and pin gram in I think if he just kept running I went ahead and right in the hands seemed kind of slipped to him and tried to create a little space for him to go catch that ball if he just runs underneath it I think he has a touch voice on the third and six from the 38yard line which here and then stringent to the outside intended for Jericho cotchery James ahead oboe on the safety blitz fourth down Daryl Smith came to the outside but Ben shoulda stayed put here he comes out here and I think he would have been blocked because Le'Veon Bell did a good job picking up the safety blitz he had time but I think that pressure flashed in his face and made him feel like he had to bail out of there Matt McGuire picked up about a month ago ladarius lip after a sheet requirement on Dallas Cowboy kicker one will bounce it to five and be down but about the 10 yard line black going cover to go to work that's fine thanks everybody seven nothing really tonight show coming up some of the guests will include the voices Christina Aguilera Baltimore Inner Harbor they light it up on Thanksgiving night Bernard Pierce is now in as the running back and he takes it and gears up to the 14 yard line well Joe Flacco here we go again a little push you show me this was the case after the second or third play of the game we've got new players in this rivalry but the same result yes traditionally no other more than twenty yards from the line of scrimmage last year Flacco's mine touchdown pass is that a postseason he was spectacular on their run to the Lombardi Trophy with five touchdown passes this year in 57 only one touchdown pass on passed more than twenty yards from scrimmage that was last week though tonight he came within the yard of doing it again with Jacoby Jones making the catch and this would well there was the big Throwdown to Torrey Smith they get them in line for the first touchdown looked awfully close to a touchdown their dude in it but this has been an interesting year they've almost had to throw deep because of some of the losses of his possession receivers Dennis Pitt in Anquan Boldin and even Ray Rice hasn't been home Pierce he fights his way before you first out but this is the Baltimore running offense this year it's amazing when you look at it the league average is always around for this year it's 4.2 per rush but the Ravens rice is averaging 2.9 there is Ray Pearce is averaging 2.7 the team is under 3 as well in the 27th in rushing yards per game and next to last only Jacksonville is worth that yards per carry talking about no London game the guy breaks off about an 11 yard scamper well you know there's a lot of things different on this team my core over here on the righthand side making that block but no Brian McKinney they trade for Eugene Monroe here he is over here and to let you know assembly their outstanding guard who were all picked parts of that playoff run last year no longer here or hurt 34 has dropped Torrey Smith cutting to the outside running an out route second down and 10 with 48 seconds remaining and there is Dick LeBeau the great Dick LeBeau at the age of 76 55th consecutive season as a player or coach in the Hall of Fame was a great defensive back primarily with Detroit 14 games on Thanksgiving Day with wise Alaska Alaska recall night like tonight 37 degrees and ask Alaska circuit at 10:00 to the 39yard line he goes tackle by camera Hayward and our third scrum of evening and not the last that a split decision going so far but these teams understand exactly what this game is about I mean this is almost an elimination game not truly the Torrey Smith and Ike Taylor on the outside going at it a little holding going on and then a little of that and a little of that you know wide receivers are pretty roughandtumble guys now excuse me yeah they'd like to sort of stir that stuff up and then look the linemen to help oh my gosh with Baltimore takes a timeout and the the well the quarter comes to an end and they got the timeout before the end of the quarter it's gonna be third and five when we come back tonight's aerial coverage is being brought to you by Geico buy a book downtown Baltimore M&amp;T Bank Stadium near downtown Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya Happy Thanksgiving and it's been a great day for you this is pretty tasty dessert we have second quarter we'll start before the Baltimore timeout the clock had expired so you had the end of the quarter not charged at the timeout we start with a 35 and it's a first down as the pass is caught here his second grab of the night and that takes them all over the 41 yard line well we've seen Brandon Stokley over the years not a young man by any means a little bit of that in and out route you see some Wes Welker of the world doing this kind of thing but guys that can move the chains on third down and five are always going to be valuable no matter how old they are still a 37 is the oldest wide receiver in the league races back in as the running back out of the pistol to the 41 nice got hurt second game of the season said it's the first time he's really been hurt hip injury and said he just didn't feel right until the end of October well if you saw the play he kind of went down in the heap he wasn't even hit just handed the ball was going around the right side and just went down he thought he broke his hip he went off to the sideline and goes guys I think I broke my hip he said believe you have to be walkin if you broke your hippety he's never pulled a muscle in his life I couldn't believe it when he was telling us that I've never heard of a football player say that second an eighth and the pack we cutting across was the tie then ed Dixon there's still dennis pitta hope to have him back when they play a week from Sunday and it will be third down and a B you want Torrey Smith went to the Baltimore sideline holding his hand and you know the Ravens are going more and more to this no huddle as well they they really want Joe Flacco to begin to do a little of what eight Manning and Tom Brady have done we need the defense that's the right call let him go black on third and eight bangs in the pocket that pass is incomplete trying to get it underneath to Brandon Stokley and in comes the punting unit and as they work on the hand or arm of or risk the Torrey Smith on the sideline so much the big play threat first now it helps a little bit Jacoby Jones back in action so you get that balance effect on both sides of the ball but here's one of the more exciting young players in the league this Antonio Brown his dad's in the Arena League Hall of Fame touchdown Eddie Brown and he's been lighting it up and sam cooke found a pen inside the 20 and he does at the 15yard line try makes a fair catch early second quarter seven to nothing why I'm thankful I'm thankful for my wonderful family and the fact that I get a chance to play this great game I'm so thankful for my family friends loved ones this great country we get to live in the sport I get to play and obviously Steeler Nation Nana Roethlisberger part of that great draft class of 2004 with Eli Manning Philip Rivers Flacco Horsa that 2008 class and has been the starter for Baltimore since day one so raucous burger goes to work from the 15 miss burg trailing seventh inning man the Antonio Brown for a gain of 12 we've mentioned before Chris a lot of the success that Pittsburgh had came when they began to go no huddle in October B September was a total disaster for this dam yeah and you know he's now calling about 99 percent of the plays when they do get in the nohuddle he's even asked Todd Haley did not talk so much in his headset because he wants a little chance to think about what he's doing out there but like a lot of quarterbacks now they want a chance to see the defense there s12 get a look at it and make the calls and make the adjustments we gained a fire by the man you know you would think any coat any quarterback in his tenth year in the league he wants to call his own plays he wants to go know how to want everyone not just for a change of pace you know a quarterback in his 10th you who didn't want now I had never heard of it at all you know Terry Bradshaw used to call their own place but how he longs you say how hard could it be you only had four of them so you know and that's the way it was but it is because he is the one that that knows what the defense is he doesn't have to guess what it is to make the play ball here's the Wildcat now and the snap the Rex back to Bell and the rookie running back takes the ball up to the 37 yard line there's a little bit of the sign of the power of lady on bail on that one 240 plus pound running back that they love in Pittsburgh kind of went nowhere but really needed this final effort to pick up the first down even the Castro who has really been looking so much better lately the the cashflow hurt last year is at number one pick in a tooth twelve of Stanford from the 37 yard line the city bills eight camera nice job bottling him up that's an Arthur Jones the fourth year made from Syracuse pulls him down eight Terry's 21 yards September was a total disaster the Steelers did not have a single take away in four games and they had 11 turnovers they are on foreign and included a trip to London where they lost to Minnesota but since then you can see the difference especially with Ben second and 10 of the 37 and the pressure off he goes and Wampus burger dragon will goes right to the marker before he gets out of bounds it'll be a first down for Pittsburgh nice job here you're starting to see the Steelers now do a much better job of understanding where the pressure is coming from remember they lost their signal caller Marquis Pouncy about eight plays into the season so all their plans of going to the no huddle basically went out the window and they've been redeveloping Fernando Velasco I don't know where this team would be without him was cut by the Titans he had started 16 games a year before for down so he was a veteran just learning the system and now that they are starting to get on the same page this offense is playing much better a microwave before we gave him until he cooked them completely pass thrown over the middle that little was a Smith Novus boomer go put the pressure on doing weirdo coming over from the Broncos after that the contract fax machines snackfood little Elvis tumor bill right out here just to quick on the outside for Mike Adams but Ben Roethlisberger completely misses this throw I think it was Emmanuel Sanders wide open in the middle of the field he kind of took a step up and just threw it right in the dirt Bin's strongpoints they're making those throws on the move second of ten leverage up a block bundle Crennel McPhee mix attacked on Le'Veon Bell and make a third down and nine and Suggs needs the breather on this frigid night that's why McPhee was in the game that last tackle third night to the left then stays alive and hits Sanders over the middle as he does so often and has done for ten years Ben Roethlisberger extending the play staying alive tough to get that he will always been sacked a ton of times and she can do this a million times you know his ability for a guy that weighs 250 pounds or whatever it is turn his shoulder slide up keep his head down field and just flip it I mean that's that's not like a 90 mile an hour fastball there was just he just kind of flips it down there to him and Sanders goes up and makes the play but that's when you know the Steelers are getting right when Ben Roethlisberger starts to make those kind of play that was good for 15 yards from the left side the Castro may have new leak Blakeman false start offense over 66 I definitely still second down tis the cool Mike Tomlin but you have two of the very best young coaches in the league I mean they've been around I mean Mike's in his seventh season and Harbaugh here since o8 some of the owners in the past couple years and they were looking for change who kind of say hey can you find me the next Mike Tomlin Oh John Harbaugh first and 15 dump it off the Bell that was a good tough money before he is forced out of bounds one of the featured attractions has to be Kelvin Beach I'm a young man that had to take over he has played basically everything there is to play along that offensive line he started the year as a tight end the extra blocker on the outside moved to Center when Pouncy got hurt moved to guard when they need in there moved to right tackle now he's playing left tackle by far the most athletic guy on that offensive line in halfway through the quarter second down and six it bends it incomplete intended for Sanders it'll be third down and six for the Steelers I'll tell you one of the guys that I think's made a huge difference for the rave and Daryl Smith the linebacker they picked up from Jax here's a guy that you know you lose Ray Lewis and all that better and leadership and all the knowledge of this game and he has simply been sensational this year I just don't know where they would have we're talking to John the guys who have played best for him this year first name you mentioned Smith pressure all the way across the board stealers classes behind Sanders and incomplete so the drive bogs down started back at the their own 15yard line they've run 11 plays on this drive but still haven't even gotten into field goal range now and that was an interesting call there because you have really needed a completion of some kind you know this 47yard field goal would have felt a little bit better than a 50yarder on this cold night well indeed they have I said they have it but it's a 50yarder meaning something a little bit easier this Shantz reasons have a terrific year is only miss to all season backtoback : living too soon that's reason to the right side and we'll go down he left before the balls before was down they break for Baltimore to get it in this field so Sean Sweden starts to move forward before Matt McBride is able to get the snap here's what happens it's just he knows there's no chance he can kick it and then he just tries to get the ball and go run whether it was interesting the Ravens only had nine guys on the field in defense and luckily we were able to stop him for some run front so the ball at the 44 Baltimore takes you there rice goes to the outside and moves it to the 47 yard line and we check with Michelle al Steelers defensive end Brett Keisel is questionable with a left foot injury same foot that's kept him out of the last two games meanwhile wave is wide receiver Brandon Stokley is questionable with a left knee he went back to the locker room with dr. Leanne curl for further evaluation all right Thank You Michelle as Torrey Smith does come back in after working on his hand for a while on the sidelines Saturday at 7 and the past intended for Jacoby Jones and he is slowing getting up hit by Cortez Allen and he will come limping off will Jones one of the really good young players in this league right now is Jarvis Jones getting a chance to play here but they think athletically and mentally now he is so much further ahead than most of the defensive ends and oh my goodness this is a story where he got Torrey Smith limping around over with the bad wrist whatever happened to him and exhausted the game he's in motion works out of the slot clock was gonna go down the left side for interference on Mike Taylor Torrey Smith down the sideline reaching back up court and draws the flag well whether it's Josh Gordon or Calvin Johnson teams are now targeting Ike Taylor fierce defense in the 24 sometimes that do happen when you're near 11th year in the league yeah this is a veteran to say the least defense you can see but I sort of hooked that arm it's one thing to do a little contact that you could see you hooked it into his body good call by the officials 26 yard penalty puts the Ravens at the 27 yard line you know Chris we checked with the league it's interesting we should brought it up during the commercial break when suiza moved forward before the ball was down you could have called a false start on the kicker but it's something that the Dean Blandino the head of officiating said he's never seen but you could have called it yeah we might have to call John Madden on that way yeah you see everything but I've never seen the kicker in an illegal motion second down and eight the ball is at the 25yard line at six minutes as mike taylor is there till that time able to swatted away from the grass script smith third and eight well this is pretty well done by Ike Taylor and talking to Dick LeBeau about Ike I said how is he hanging in there because it's been a rough couple of weeks for him he said it's the great thing about Ike Taylor he said you would never know it he could give up touchdown passes all day long he'd line up on the next one and he would just feel like I'm gonna win this one he always takes the best receiver the other team has and sometimes that's a tough assignment he goes he goes back to Jerry Rice 3rd and 8 because Flacco is gonna take off and get the first down joe flacco not sliding knew he needed the first finally tackled by Jarvis Jones and moves to change on a third date this get some credit to Michael war on the outside here just barely held off Jason worlds and Joe Flacco said you know we've been struggling to run the football so I almost feel like this season I have to do it myself a little more often I don't like to run but when necessary and in key situations I read that was huge there he said six third down runs this season all four first and he's averaged over five yards of carry when the other guys read all three offense number 68 fiveyard penalty still first half Thank You Shipley Jacoby Jones just come back into the game there he is boy what a playoff run he had a great Super Bowl game caught the pass against Denver and probably the play of the year when you say that pass in a 40something seconds to go and look like the Ravens were gonna be one and done and 70 yards later here we go nope Flacco back up the truck for the bank you're 21 yards winders Ray Rice we won't tell you who it is that one of the Steelers we went with last night that he said he's he called somebody mister 120 we went one then we thought for a second 120 million dollars we can't give him up but he's clearly on the defense 120 I don't know what he's thinking about there we go maybe it was Ryan Clark but we can't quite remember there's still 120 second and 14 he's gonna lose the ball it's a strip sack ball is loose at the 29 yard line but recovered as Jason walls came in but Baltimore is going to retain possession so strip sacked by number 93 the development of young pass rushers watch his hands here just smack the hands of Michael Oher right off of them and Michael Oher now is in a very interesting situation because of the trade of Eugene Monroe both of those guys will need contracts I doubt very seriously they both get it and my guess is that you Jeanne Moreau is going to get the deal in or will not he may be somewhere else next year he did not play well last week third down and 23 second sack for shucks his way to the 25 to make it a little easier for Justin Tucker on the field goal attempt upcoming Will Allen making the stop and maybe we will see the holder go in motion this time now that was a good stand though after you give up the long pass interference call you hold Baltimore two field goals that's better especially because Ben got the offense moving at least a little bit 22 straight successes for Tucker this one will be a 43yard attack sam cooke and Tuckers boot is 33 Oh water leads tamed it up and over Pittsburgh well it's a fun and easy way for you to hop on the NFL play 60 bus to get on board join the movement to help children get active and healthy visit NFL rush calm / play 60 kids sit here tonight some of the play 60 group before the game on this Thanksgiving evening it Perelman the Pittsburgh Steelers dan that attend to nothing with 301 to play in the opening and the Steelers have had two long drives but these there is results with the bunch she'll go banks his way out to the 28yard box slow rock this burger put the points up on the school board Wow it's only about ten weeks away now February 6 the world's greatest athletes coming out of the deep Sochi Olympic Winter Games it all begins February the six right here on NBC closing water there is a look at Baltimore but a guy who look like is the most decorated American Olympian ever Michael Phelps right there this year in Baltimore good nervous it's preferable you know we pass to the outside taken by brown but he can't get attractiveness MIT coming up from the right corner to make the tackle after a gain of two yards its burg offense so the three play drive to open things out three and out and then an 11play drive resulting in a punt the 12 play drive resulted in the botched field goal attempts and we've had the ball a while and it's resulted in my Felix Jones the former cowboy good second of eight that pass is incomplete intended for ground over the middle it'll be third down and eight and Roethlisberger at the current moment is 10 for 17 471 yards Josh Pines that they're inside backers falling back underneath that so far the Ravens have been doing a look where they're they're putting three or four guys to the outside right three guys to the outside let them sort of leaving right my ceders who tries to back his way to a first down but the line judge comes into spotted about a half yard shy and we go to the twominute warning and Elvis doom reviled as the injured Baltimore Raven it'll be fourth and one at the twominute warning when we come back turn a halftime coming up the Cowboys come back to not go up Oakland Lions get 37 honey shower garages can't get back past for Green Bay Bob and Heinz break it down the first half wall of the Toyota halftime Harbor of Baltimore forth and one Matt McBride will punt and Jacoby Jones sets up at his own 12 yard line for the Raylan it's a line drive low bouncing kick pittsburgh's hop and out of bounds it goes at the 15yard line watch 52 the half ends to nothing Paul Jean Sunday Night Football and Thanksgiving night being brought to you by the brilliant minds and machines of GE by Toyota care by the new windows one experience for everything in your life and by the hobbit the desolation of smaug in theaters everywhere December the 13th the it's the desolation of smaug meanwhile it was Plymouth Rock are you sure local shots but farewell Christmases are coming pepto starts with a pass to Ray Rice's it's broken up as he receives its ziggy hood making the tackle Ravens have all of their timeouts second and nine and depending on how this play goes pittsburgh has a couple two so see what happens here's the bashes caught at the 20yard line it's gonna be three and one is now a spark the longtime Colt makes it a third and one and it's one of those situations now we're in Baltimore coming up through the line have all of those timeouts pull them all right rustling a hit is Ray Rice and I can start thinking about those timeouts and they take it right here after a first down 64 ticks left so too much to time outs remaining for Baltimore as you look at polo Manos fairly quiet to this point tonight haven't called his name from the 26 yard line sexy off juggling catches and he gets tackled up at the 32 yard line by Will Allen where if Ray Rice starts making some catch and run plays again that has really not been around this offense because of his injury but that has been such a key component of the success of Ravens over the years second and three hang at a false start on the right side that's or backing up Michael Oher is trying to explain hey I know the staff can I moved on the snap counters because I moved ahead of there are other offensive linemen he does do that he times it up pretty well I don't know if he did that time or not but but he usually is the first offensive lineman to move in the tape I've watched right on the end of the line of scrimmage here you'll I'd say that's a little before this yeah I would too I'll start offense number 74 it's a fiveyard penalty in addition this situation requires a ten second runoff and Baltimore has elected not to take a time out to save the ten seconds so the game clock operator please put 28 seconds on the game clock 28 that's a very interesting call right there I'm not sure I wouldn't have taken the time out and saved those 10 seconds right there I don't know what you're going to do with the right the SEC second down and eight curious decision right there the pass is caught by rice he gets to the 33 now you gonna take another timeout here but you only have 17 it's going to tick down and apparently they're gonna be contentious to go in with a 10 nothing lead or are they yeah so that's the way they play it at the end of the crowd doesn't like it the Harbaugh is content to go in with a tin avoid food even at the hand the Ravens will get the second hands they go up into the first and for more 10 Pittsburgh nothing Peter the halftime coming your way next Sunday night football on Thanksgiving night from Baltimore Maryland tender nothing is our halftime score figured to be a defensive struggle figure to be lowscoring and really there's one big play is the difference in the game right now the long pass set up the only touchdown so far Joe Flacco throwing went in there to Torrey Smith so we'll make it the Burger King inside edge how about that we talked about the fact that I Taylor sort of set up to the outside and fighting Torrey Smith the in Sykes he knew he had help on the inside there it is Brett Keisel is gonna drop underneath and he's gonna be the guy to take away the inside throw unfortunately for Kiesel he's not used to dealing with quarterback Joe Flacco looks them off just far enough makes them lean a little left plays it behind him and there it is inside edge but you only tightly touchdown the game check out more insights from tonight on NBC Sports live extra and of course the big play that I refer to as the 54 yard pass that set that up that was initially ruled a touchdown and then they put the ball back at the oneyard line and from there they scored the only touchdown of the game rushing yardage Boylan with 47 Pittsburgh only 20 despite the fact those carried the ball nine times tonight totally Arden's 151 to 98 it spurts out a little bit more possession time a couple of long drives resulting in no points careful with this guy San Francisco 49ers to tell you all about it John squeeze him a little adventure in the opening half jumping the gun on a field goal attempt we'll send it down to Toby Jones good to run this back from a oneyard line Jones advances way I've passed the 30 to the 32 yard line as we go to Michelle well I just spoke with Mike Tomlin who told me he's not only concerned about his team trailing 10 nothing he said it's not what they're doing to us it's our lack of execution we've got to pay greater attention to detail they will be without Brett Keisel their defensive end who is out with a left injury now as for John Harbaugh he loves what his defense is doing he wants them to continue to prevent Ben Roethlisberger from stepping up in the pocket and taking shots Elvis to Merville by the way left ankle sprain questionable all right Thank You Michelle keep an eye on him when the defense comes back out here's Bernard Pierce of course Harbaugh should be very pleased with that defensive performance only 98 yards for Pittsburgh in the opening half and you're starting to get a feel for these two teams and the possibility of their getting hot the winner of this game is going to be very dangerous one second and six rataxes very big game obviously for both teams they come in five and six the winners going to get a leg up in the fight for a wildcard berth and maybe win a division title but if pull them over to lose the game doubly tough because they then will have lost both games to Pittsburgh and that would be a huge tiebreaker both these teams still have a shot at good Cincinnati as well they do Bengals will play at San Diego on Sunday afternoon here's Pierce to the 48 just to refresh the standings in the AFC North and they've tightened up in the past couple of weeks since he is seven and four whenever this game is going to go to six and six and the loser five and seven and the Browns are four and seven right now I'm Mike Tomlin pacing the sideline here second down and eight exhorting his defense is incomplete Cortez Allen with the coverage that time on Jones Polamalu was blitzing third and 8 Paulo Malo right here is gonna get the immediate pressure and then it's going to come from behind watch the little pirouette here working against Bernard Pierce and Lawrence Timmons and Jason worlds almost got there so you get the idea now Dick LeBeau unwilling to just sit back he's gonna fire a few bullets here in this out watch Smith and Smith strikes the stumble and something Marcus forward progress make it I it looks well it's gonna be right on the line so it should be a first down and as they take a look at the side line goes down just at the 44 yard line in a measure I'd say yeah that's pretty close when that knee went down they're getting a pretty good spot out of that very good spot you can tell Tomlin hates that spot he's right there he can see it and looks like it's gonna be a first down that's interesting where was he touch to go down as one thing and to be touched when you're down is the other right now that was a third and eight so a critical spot on a third down play Blakeman chaingang coming in Chris Tomlin could challenge this spot it's going to be a first down and there's Mike wanted challenge it and maybe lose it lose a second half time out you take a look knees down there's the ball the official sticks are actually on the near side as you look at it you saw those sticks they're on the far side the official sticks are on the near side Tomlin still pacing still upset but he's not going to challenge yeah I don't think you win that challenge if you do they probably go for it on fourth day makes his first catch of the night and that is good for a first down rookie out of Georgia going to Steeler scream right back at him here everybody's coming this way and kicking it out and Marlon brown has really stepped up I remember watching this young man playing against Carolina in preseason having a huge game he had monster games in the preseason and more and more now you really get the feeling that he's going to be a factor coming down the stretch for them and with five touchdown catches this season one rookie campaign at the 33 yard line caught by Bernard Pierce tackled by Timmons after a short gain no Eugene Monroe we talked about him came over from Jacksonville right here working against the young phenom and Jarvis Jones who they are so high on they think that his potential is just unlimited it's tough it's behind the line of scrimmage it really is amazing isn't it watch Baltimore try and run the football after all those years and Ray Rice and Bernard Pierce seemed like they averaged up close to 5 yards per carry but totally different team and without Coletti assembly you ended up having a back injury that they didn't even really know about they just know his play was down they went in and got him looked at and they said he has to have immediate surgery he's in danger he was a force over there and he says just has not been the same offensive line it's almost impossible that was listen three yards to rush Jaco escapes gets it away and gets the first down on a patch to Torrey Smith so nice movement William gay keying it on a corner blitz but Flacco is able to see it move those shoulders get away gets the pass away moves the chains come with a corner blitz and one of the problems is if it doesn't get there because Dick LeBeau likes to play those zone defenses in behind the Blitz that time he went right across the formation to where the Blitzer was nobody home went Rice laugh and you give it to Weiss and right through the middle and right fakes of only 11 tackled by Ryan Clark and rice he's had such a tough time getting anything this year as his longest game of the night when I was nice little track for Marshall Yan they're going to come right over here and kick out when rice is just going to shoot right through that little gap and take it with the way this team can throw the ball deep you give them even a little bit of a running game they could be a force in the last quarter of the season secondary and a one it's a high snap of the flag it Wargo the field we know that okay that's right I'm used to that false start offense right tackle fiveyard penalty still second down makes it second down and six rice from eight through 12 four point five per carry Pierce 4.9 this is a big time onetwo punch and their numbers right now with Pierce I have picking up a tent tonight looking to 70 to 80 second at 6:00 and describe incomplete and his story Smith stopping turning around and Ike Taylor right there with a third down every time the free safety goes to the middle of the field and it's one on one on the outside Joe Flacco goes right there that's his guy but Ike Taylor now that's two in a row he's made a big play on and so now it's a huge third down I think I would say I told you a big time dude he just doesn't flinch you know you can beat him once or twice but he doesn't back up that touchdown makes this a threepossession game these Street Bulls that's a big big lead and that pitch is incomplete so a big third down stop right there Ziggy hood came in and was able to jostle the quarterback is Flacco threw it away fourth down you know those were plays in the past that Ray Rice just won all those battles you know he was a guy that had a way of making teams pay when do you wanted to play coverage on him oneonone on the outside he's getting back to form but he's just not quite there yet 34 yard attempt for Justin Tucker and a great rookie year second year of the University of Texas cook gets it down 24 straight field goals for Justin Tucker and Illinois jeans ship Eastern episode of mine central mountain right here Allan Poe it's where the Ravens would come from the Baltimore Ravens coming to existence every leaving Cleveland we're gonna do history here in 1996 Dick LeBeau but we fit the earth coach in consecutive season sharks with his defense right now they need supplement offense third quarters Felix Jones down sit in the end zone and walk this board will have a ball for the first time in the second half when we come back happy days given from the bottom are a star's family there is there else Uggs it's a little part of a couple of Super Bowl teams 11 years in the NFL play of course last year with the Super Bowl champions one draft choice back in on three nanosec raucous border more than anyone else and the pictures Florida the sealer is in dire need of getting something going here down 13th or nothing early in the third well part of their success on that one is their double team and Suggs on the outside and I tell you Pittsburgh's got a pretty impressive streak going now three straight weeks Mario Williams and Donna conclude Phil Taylor in the crowds none of those guys show up on the staff page and so far the night Suggs has not showing up on a staff full marquee names he was the one they were targeting they did not him to beat them tonight this is Bell Le'Veon Bell out to the 47 yard line and there is suds making the stop second down and four Suggs career against the Steelers 14 and a half sacks +5 and postseason through sack fumbles in the regular season a couple of picks as well they think they know the signals he had an interception on a quick screen once where it truly did look like he knew exactly what the at four down at the 49 by John bun go back to 2010 or else sucks you will see been marking out the audible sucks paying attention walks out a little bit takes us try now watch right up the field thank you very much and what stomp it down she was coming along with third down two in the middle is a big bowl therefore Bell inside the 40 Bell inside the 20 and first and gold Matt Elam working number one pick out of Florida lines him down after a gain of 43 yards a good double team over here on this side as they get a little movement this secure Haloti not in so many times that's the key but boy that's the kind of breakout play they've been waiting for from Le'Veon Bell and once it now that was his best game of the year was against the Ravens maybe he's getting it going again he had 27 yards before that food the longest one against the season and complete Ravens it does make the point Chris so good in the red zone defensively and the Steeler so bad I mean this has been sort of the nightmare matchup so far this year because the Pittsburgh Steelers obviously at this point in the game they've got to put a touchdown on the board here but this is what the Ravens do best so this final 8 yar go bra rushing touchdown all year for for Jackson Buffalo second goal pay attention that Heath Miller in the slot Jericho 3:7 touchdown passes rakesh Brazil five entire throne intended for factory and broken up by Jimmy Smith third and goal let's say you have to give Kelvin Beecham some credit and this guy is hanging in spying sometime really you get this kind of time that kind of protection he moves around usually ben roethlisberger and the Steelers score a touchdown out of that very impressive that time on the back end by the Ray I was doing a little shaken up at the end of the first pan is in there now to the inside then step it up gets it away caught in the back of the end zone Roethlisberger extending hits Emanuel Sanders to finally get Pittsburgh some points nice move in the back of the end zone by Emanuel Sanders but that was all Ben Roethlisberger just buying some time watch Sanders gonna go right down the middle of field between the hash marks fake to the outside back to the inside Ben sees it luckily nobody flying in or Sanders coming in and really everybody sort of leaves that way and then they can't relax react late Darrell Smith pulled just enough by Sanders huge touchdown for the Steelers fourth touchdown reception of the year for Sanders suiza for the extra point so they go 80 yards seven plays two runs and five passes 626 remaining in the third it's not 13 7 Ravens trip for us we're back with you on Sunday night it'll be the Giants and the Redskins about southern and football all sorts food football night 7:00 Eastern Time storylines and Sugoi a few conversations rolling you would giant Redskins Sunday night 72 hours sixty nine and a half squeeze it stick or give it at the goal line by Jones the Cobi Jones gets my season 27 yard line Court is Allen stood between Jones and the goal line but stop saving tackle what a play by Cortez Allen to give his team a chance this thing opens up wide open and they've got a blocker in front for suiza had no chance whatsoever and Cortez Allen is basically keeping the Steelers in this thing they take that touchdown off the board was one right back and all the momentum is gone what a brilliant play by Cortez out I think anybody who's been attached to go to Jones 73 yard run back the ball at the 27 yard line play action girls caught the goes the tightend and Dixon absolutely love the call right here by Jim Caldwell right after the big play everybody's flying to go get the run you think you're gonna come out play a little ball control go right to the bootleg very decisive play call comes up in the pistol from the 11 yard give it to white eight of a couple seconded a tackling the little conversations Ryan Clark said take that kind of thing this is starting to get a little salty out here right now Ryan Clark did put a big hit on him rice trying to get back after it what's the tale into that thing I was a little helmet the helmet shot for snow penalty with the ball carrier just coming through the line of scrimmage second and eight underneath the wife Loren's timmons making the tackle five minutes to go in the third quarter big third and seven up coming oh man Opie since I handle a couple of runs crowd hates that Cole Timmins makes the tackle he's been on all three last stops and it's fourth down big play here back to back by Timmons to make the open field tackle then come back and make that one as well he has become the defensive signal caller in there when Larry Foote got hurt and we've got a flag down just came down well after the play I think we've got unsportsmanlike fleet Blakeman after the play unsportsmanlike conduct offense number 27 Wow 15yard penalty well rice was joined with Clark and then he continued that and that turns a chip shot field goal into something a little bit more only matters if you miss but turns a 23yard field goal attempt into a 38yard field goal attempt Justin Tucker 4th Street and there's 25 to make it a twopossession lead again 349 11 to the third 67 Baltimore that's the gray rice so will Ravens help serve over 5 dear Aunt efforts to stop bullying around great story today on today's show thing wasn't gonna take any bullying on the field and everything point tackle by Cortez alum you gotta keep that in mind jesseman Tucker's ticked off mrs. Sanders at the 20yard line 16:7 why am i thankful loving wife and three children obviously I've been blessed professionally I've got a great job I work with great people on a daily basis I'm thankful for my wife and my two beautiful children healthy children and just being able to live the NFL dream in Baltimore and enjoy the fans and the great teammates and the great memories that I've had playing as a raven well the crowd was booing as we went to commercial and even more accurate and we're going to show you what happened on that run back by Jones with Mike Tomlin along the sideline a threaten out of it the first exposure to first the stream about seven let's go back to that long 73yard return by Jones here we go here's Tom went over here obviously Gopi Jones there and Tomlin is essentially on the field here and you just wonder and he's trying to get out of the way there but did that force Jacoby Jones the lean back into the tackle by Cortez Allen don't want to in any way say that was something intentional but if he had picked off the official on that play or touch the player either way that's a big penalty exactly we've seen that happen a couple of times this year where coaches have been involved even officials along the sidelines they can actually if you impede the runner or come off the sidelines and make a tackle or anything bizarre like that or they can award a touchdown they can take the ball and say he would have scored a touchdown on that and award the touchstone so they played it back about five times and crazy third and three Rhys using one this burger intended for bill far sideline I tell you I think Daryl Smith has done more in coverage to help the Ravens than just about any linebacker you see it go out to San Francisco they've got great coverage guys as well but watch this they're going to try and run a little pick inside but he just hugs right on to lay beyond Bell and does not allow Ben Roethlisberger the opportunity that could have been about a 70 yard play there was nobody else out there they've got the two combatants going Tomlin staking his gravel on the sidelines Matt McBride avoids the first man yards Marcus Wheaton making the tackle and back we go to the earlier return by Jacoby Jones well what's bizarre about it is he's looking the other way but glancing back over his shoulder that you can see he kind of did force Jacoby Jones back into the field a little mission accomplished almost and he's sniggering I mean you know with my man he's a player now don't try to get anything bite him was a fourpoint play no matter how you want to slice it for the 36 yard line ears up to the 42 yard line tackled by Cameron Heyward son of the late not to live but the iron head Heyward who played running back of course for New Orleans one of the guys that's been causing headaches tonight is Jason world right in behind their 93 and so they just doubleteam them here go ahead we're gonna make Will Allen come up and make attack second and four mrs. Peirce tackle by Paulo Malo you know it's been a little while since I've seen joy Polamalu play the way that he has of course missed all last year with that cap entries up there playing that linebacker position and the dime defense again but watch how quickly he closes on the ball when he sees him that pass in the air and he is right there right now and when he's playing like that the Steelers are a different defense third and four good protection upfront great protection this lack a lot of time throw is cut inside the 20 like Jacoby Jones PACA by Allen and what a job I that offensive 133 yards does this look familiar looks like ben roethlisberger great protection up front flacco just keeps moving keeps wiggling around until he can finally fire went down the field that was third down and once again when he just has a knack for big plays and Flacco keeps giving him these opportunities and he keeps making him I thought his playoff run last year is as good as anything I ever saw sensational that's why they call him mr. 120 and in the third 67 and tonight aerial coverage from Baltimore being brought to you by Geico Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth then Michele Tafoya on this Thanksgiving night M&amp;T Bank Stadium each team 5 and 6 16 7 Baltimore as we start the final quarter for the 1st and 10 at the 24 of the Steelers haven't seen a lot of the Wildcat tonight out of the Ravens definitely 120 said no we don't want any more a wildcat yeah I've seen it he went to commercial he saw Jones on the sideline after a long catch you can paint a bit of a prices and it's gonna be but outofbounds and Torrey Smith was there couldn't even hold on anyway he was on the chalk and the ball came loose incomplete second ten five Tony Smith had this one they was just working oneonone on Ike Taylor and of course Toria with that great speed this thing was a remarkable throw by Flacco he was under pressure from two different guys Polamalu tries to fly back and get underneath it down was dropped right in a bucket and dropped period it was a perfect throw play stoppage for a false start false start offense number 74 alright got penalty so second out that's another one or that's three any time you end up with Troy Polamalu on your side you know something's up and they had the stunts in the loops and but I will say this compared to what we saw last week against the Jets and the Jets have one of the best defensive lines if not the best in all of football but this offensive line is a major step up from what we saw last week black they retreat sets up the screen rice and first include a break up the blocking convoy was William Gay stopping met for a gain of two third and 13 now William gays starting to put a couple of good games together now he had he was terrific last week in Cleveland and comes up with a play there when they need it most I mean they really this is a nodoubter they have to keep him out of the end zone now Jones back in the game flank him wide to the left if LeBeau watching his defense dig in third and 13 or backhoe throws high master's intended to Dallas part so we forced that now and you're looking at about a 45 yard field goal attempt well you don't have to be big to be a good block or watch Ray Rice here that we call this a chip that's a that's a big chip put a big guy right there on Jason worlds they have turned their attention that way he's been disrupted blocked by Rice Tucker 3 for 3 tonight 48 34 38 this one 45 his banner season continues 13:59 left in regulation 1970 the quarterbacks as old as the rest percent was thought the biggest guy in the world but a big heart kids playing football thanks of course enjoying every moment here to this point 1907 the force border bring it back out to the 40yard line so Justin Tucker of all things boots one away free kick bounce the ball we placed at the 40yard line first down Pittsburgh well you know we missed our turkey today your buddy I brought one for you you know who left this in the booth I do now I do now our good buddy Dan Dierdorf and we congratulate Dan on a spectacular career retiring after 30 years of broadcasting who's in the booth here your former partner right on Monday night one of the great guys thanks Dan he went all out as close as we came to Turkey today from the 40yard line Roethlisberger begins this Drive is not court it looked like brown hat it got a gripped away Jimmy Smith covering on the play Louis second down intend to tell you one of the guys who's really stuffed up this year is Jimmy Smith he's a tall guy long arms and he's been more physical this year than I've ever seen him those are plays he just wouldn't make in the past they just kept encouraging him and encouraging to get more physical use those long arms and now that he's doing it he's been tough to be we're stepping up to award the pressure sliding and throws complete defeat Le'Veon Bell to the 46 yard line and it'll set up a third and four I can't say enough good things about the left tackle of Kelvin Beach on the radar screen for the Pittsburgh Steelers when the season started got his chance because of the injury to marquise counsel the channel has to be 6a play left tackle he is and Baltimore takes a timeout and let's go to Michelle well guys I asked a Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith whom you're talking about about what makes Ben Roethlisberger difficult to defend and he said Ben's awareness in the pocket is ridiculous someone can have a great sack on him and he escapes and throws the ball downfield he's like the king of loose plays right now that's his strongest point and that's something you have to try to take away from him and as we've seen that's easier said than done you bet Thank You Michelle is Roethlisberger gets ready to come to the line for a third and three and again every third now becomes pretty big right now this game be important so it can't be overstated in terms of the winners going to be in pretty good shape in terms of a road to the playoffs and the loser is going to be fairly close to dire straits dirty dirt he's able to convert as Ben hits the manual Sanders across the 50 forward progress to the 49 yard line first down and just the old Peyton Manning play it's it's so hard to stop Tony Dungy here tonight hit an outside receiver comes and bends to the inside even if you know it's coming sometimes hard to stop and just such a significant driver but toss bill and we'll be running back for a gain of nine yards tackled by Suggs it'll be second down and one where here's the maturation of a young player Le'Veon Bell come with the slot blitz over here and he has the presence of mind to know that he's hot does not run into who is that Daryl Smith there on the outside Ben knew exactly where's that health and reporter back tells you out there that's five catches the life of as a carry 12 times for 70 arts at the big 44 yard and they give it the bill and he's sliding on the outside and has enough for the first down tripped up by McPhee maybe on bail what a great college career he had let the big ten was fifth overall in rushing in the nation and a big guy like 245 pounds so you know he can pass protect it's proving himself as a good receiver after as the first three games of the season to the foot injury sir pinnacle debut in the September this boy here pillars taken down by Daryl Smith and you saw the flood coming holding defense number 21 fiveyard penalty automatic first down and that was Lord Darius Webb now they moved Webb back into that slot corner position and have improved as a defense since he went in there you know a lot of people think that playing cornerback on the outside is the toughest role in this nickelanddime defense by far it's playing the slots the toughest miss team CEO was doing ago with that bad ankle we did not want to put it in the ground and call them Beach I'm taking care of him eleven minutes left in the fourth the Blitz again and Ben's going to go deep and incomplete and a flag is thrown an Tonio brown with Cory Graham covering on the play and this one is going to go against the Ravens like Antonio Brown gave a little late push off but the flag is already thronged by the pass holding defense over 24 Finley like Port Graham right off the bat here is going to grab the back of Antonio Brown shirt just a little jersey pole that is the only thing that everybody sees when they the Jersey gets tugged and you could see the little give and take down to field the flag was already gone by that point so a couple of big penalties Hillier here helping the Steelers empties the sweat 27 first down to the end zone and to beef when the coverage is good on Sanders you've doubled on the plate where I am is there with them it'll be second and ten starting to see a lot more man coverage out of the Ravens than what we saw earlier in a year they've got faith in these three quarterbacks on the outside there's grogram little double move and he was beaten he almost grabbed him you could see him kind of grab for the hip but did not but the reason that they're starting to do main coverages are certain have more faith in this pass rush from their front port they the second of 10 and it's tipping income trying to float it in to Bell and James ahead of Oh got back there the safety the swatted aside third down what a nice play by James ahead of Bo and a huge contributor he's been it was supposed to be Michael huh that took over that other safety position worse both safeties leaving for the Ravens and Ben just tried to drop it in over his head but he had a bow able to get back and get underneath it would have been a touchdown third ten field goal still makes it a two possession game so a big conversion here for Pittsburgh as hit the first time and set up a first and goal on a cats by Antonio Brown too just remarkable timing here I've been through that ball before Antonio Brown even thought about turning around working down the field he knew he's going to go to him and man coverage the whole way so he rolled that way to change the angle of the throw and make it easier great play by then maybe fourth catch of the season fourth tonight for the league leader in receptions Brown now a timeout is taken by bull or their second first and goal Friday that they have to Thanksgiving a living a hockey for you tomorrow on NBC it starts at 1:00 o'clock Eastern Time to the original six a New York Rangers and the Boston Bruins got a touchdown last time there can they do it again against this top red zone defriend first and goal from the aid two of its time attics head to the finish and the pass is caught by nice to work his way into the end zone and it's going to be spotted just short of the goal line Darrell Smith saving the touchdown they'll go no huddle here on second and goal boys trying to keep anything de Lyonne kind of defenses off the field they're stuck over here on the boundary and maybe on bail walks in walks into the end zone now we see Tom Brady do this all the time he gets a big play goes right down to the goal line get him up there don't let those big monsters in there and Heath Miller comes down and blows open another hole here he comes right down in here catches Daryl Smith and there's just nobody else there now we got ourselves a ballgame say well it figures it's Pittsburgh and bullhorn so many of these games are decided by three points so many go right down to the end as did the one in Pittsburgh on October the 20th Beecham is shaken up to the left half that comes off for the moment under his own power Sweden is in to try to reduce the lead to five so nine and a half to go giving night in Baltimore 1914 I'm very thankful that I was born in the great old USA I was born to a mother who's just about the greatest woman a man could ever want to be around into a great family they taught me that service to your fellow man is a great thing we're not the only people on the planet it led me to a life of teaching and sharing I hope you'll all help somebody and remember what you're thankful for on this great day well we're talking about Dick LeBeau for years and what a what a man he is and anybody who knows him knows he is really something extraordinary that the halloffame a couple of years ago and everybody was still for him as the kickoff is a bouncing ball that's fielding the 25yard line and then run back to the 34 does it lead back up fullback it's the oldest he has the oldest starting unit in the league they averaged 29 years of age and of course a lot of that's on the back end with Clark Taylor and Paul Amato and then I'm so Brett Kissel before he got hurt tonight in the game so they're old back there well the Bo's the youngest 76 year old we've ever known shoot his age on the golf course about any time he wants to and he is a part of the original sort of Thanksgiving Day packages that lone swimmer oh this is monstrous but back in 1962 an undefeated Packers team came into play his lions and Bart Starr got sacked eleven times in that game and the Lions broke their streak with a 2614 win fast forward several years Dick LeBeau got hired by Bart Starr goes down to the basement of his house and he sees a picture of eight Lions sacking Bart Starr in a poster size thing on the wall he said you know I never really liked Bart Starr much until that moment but gained a whole new respect for the guy when I saw that picture so part doing a little piece on one of the earlier games today after Rice games through that passed to Jones up to the 40 yard line so it's third and four interesting strategy here by Baltimore going nohuddle with a five point lead and one time I thought they would start to take a little time to get a first down and take the mill inside the pittsburgh 40 to the 38 yard line big play gain of 22 now sometimes you have these three blintzes in which you come on the Blitz unless the back releases you assume he's going to try and block you but in this case he released and my guess is that was Polamalu's man and when he released out of the backfield he had to turn and run with him there was nobody left to cover him six catches for rice tonight 38 words his Pierce and Pierce looking for Hall and closes very very quickly bonds up in the arms of al woods short game second and nine all of a sudden now that Sean squeeze them in motion fuel goal they never got off starts to feel a little bigger and bigger doesn't it halfway through the fourth quarter Victoria Smith jumped I think he did last week to Vance number 82 fiveyard penalty still second down so many full arsenal against Baltimore at home you know what happens and all right as a former wide receiver I'm going to say this if people say how in the world can a wide receiver you're looking at the ball you know all that kind of stuff you usually jump offsides at home because you could actually hear the quarterback make the calls you're used to not being able to hear second and 14 if we mix the catch that was the fifth false star tonight against the Ravens so it's third down and 12 yeah and here's one of those you don't necessarily go for the first down but you'd sure love to have about seven eight yards and give your kicker a shot at this one so this may well be was at Bernard Pierce coming out of the backfield here trying to do a little catch and run action far down the 12 before day Joshy gets it away and to the 30yard line tailor saves the first down Cory Smith makes the catch but it sets up a 47yard field goal attempt for Tucker they spent the night Taylor on the outside top of the screen there this is just turning into a slugfest between them is there a foul in there yeah probably but I don't think he's quite gets there and Joe Flacco doing this pretty good impersonation of Ben Roethlisberger tonight some of his slides around the pocket but mission accomplished there don't get the first down but set up this field goal it's out 26 consecutive attempts have been made by Tucker this one from 48 cuts it down and Tucker's kick good that's five field goals for them tonight 537 remaining but it's still a onepossession game 22 pitch worth for Jane well you can download NFL mobile and get live premium content smartphone will store animal down slash global to learn more 22 to 14 Ravens on top 537 the temperature has gone from 37 to 27 clear my 6 yards because Felix Jones bitch Cowboys its dumped at the 20yard line Oh shucky Brown well over and back on Northern California John Madden looking in tonight happy Thanksgiving to you coach and your family which man's gonna do it he's gonna pick the player of the game good luck that's not easy tonight no it's a lot of candidates we we may still have the winner yet to come see how this thing goes all Kelvin Beecham's that they have exchanged he might have a chance Josh not crazy about Pickers that Justin Tucker is in the for the 21 yard line first down the Pittsburgh Steelers is what the score go and that shoulder shake in the pump a ton of time as the line does its job the cash is broken up Jericho contrary the intended receiver and Graham reaches for his right hip every defense on the play there's a lot of things to talk about on that play but if Corey Graham is hurt that is significant on the back end that was he had to cover Khatri on that one for about nine seconds I've never seen protection that good they left Heath Miller in to help block and lay beyond Bell over here on this side and they just locked down that side of the defense and that clock just kept moving and nobody was getting open you're getting him solely as able to drive off so it looks like he can come back in shortly as to be after on this side Roethlisberger go that way on the second attack when he goes by a minutes brown to the 40yard line so Brown wanted to get his hands on him at the line of scrimmage sake that is and it was Antonio who was able to avoid that and get loose for 19 one of the toughest guys in the NFL to try and jam Antonio Brown just makes shocky Brown look awful on that play and Ben was going that way the entire time bigtime play gram back in the game as you see so he goes on that's the receivers to the left side I think you're still at the test for grant the 40 yard line with 445 left in regulation the guarantee is somebody in the press box right now is watching every move Cory Graham is making that is their number one receiver the top receiver in the NFL and Tony they've been giving safety help this way when he's been split wide and that 3x1 said and they probably will hear again position nice grip by Miller first down here's Michelle well the Steelers are conducting this drive without their starting left tackle Kelvin Beecham he is questionable with a right knee injury sitting on the bench right now it doesn't look like he's ready to come back in guys all right thanks Michelle that means Mike Adams the onetime starter there he is 76 secondround pick out of Ohio State last year is the man in that spot be careful though now you got sucks with no help there get this without bad and he does and nummer makes the in the longtime security blanket the tight end picks up 13 yards and a first down well Ben's just done a masterful job tonight seeing these blitz is coming and when they do he just takes it quickly and gets it out to the hot Reed and picks up another first down gain to 13 Roethlisberger's phone for 207 yards Smith was it even looking a signal safety and that's why it ended up inside three minutes to the outside we're Jamil McLean making the tackle and Pittsburgh's gonna take its first time out before a second down and nine sometimes you throw those hot hot passes and you just get any part of the ball you can forget the lazy so Pittsburgh taking a timeout they have to plus the twominute warning of an issue right now second down in 34 yo looks like single coverage to take a shot at 40 this time Graham is on Sanders and it's incomplete as Sanders went down as he crossed the goal one falling down reaching for it couldn't hold on third and nine oh my goodness he had it and there's a flag down but upfield and it's against Pittsburgh second down Ben saw exactly what I saw and that was Gloria Grahame out here on the outside didn't even disguise it just showed the single coverage took advantage and Sanders just could not stay on his feet yeah it was a facemask all to a big one on Adams the tackle coming back and the even with Heath Miller over there to help Mike Adams is unless he has improved greatly from or we saw earlier in the tough matchup for him on so it makes it a second at 24 there's heat the other side so no health dump it off underneath Bell has room inside the 30 and to the treaty on a second and 24 first down Pittsburgh well that is a play that's relatively new now the offensive line here just come out and block in front of this screen it's like a middle screen with a wide receiver instead of the outside receiver going out they send the lineman down the field and that was huge by the center of the Lascaux the ball is at the 20yard line raucous burger soon as he throws an incomplete intended for contrary and that's going to take us to the twominute warning at officially 157 to go Baltimore in Pittsburgh what else is new right down to the wire 22 to 14 after the game the Wendy's postgame report the Madden Thanksgiving players in the game will sit down for a mini feast with Michelle Chris and I will take a look at hit to our matchup in three days the Giants and the Redskins on Sunday Night Football come up right after the game now when you think you've got an advantage with something that sucks coming off the edge full screen right we'll be screaming from trying to get the set as who have been calls here on a second and 10 from the 20 to the goal line into the end zone eat Miller for the touchdown he's been doing it for nine years and clearly they'll go for two points here is hardball looks and checks it out on this on the board he does get into the end zone does Miller as they review it upstairs as they do all scoring plays Heath Miller eight catches tonight 87 yards and Adams comes limping off but he did his job a little out not move we see so much down in the red zone outside then up the field Josh buyings reacts to the first move and here it goes that doesn't matter it always comes down to the last two minutes with these two teams well I'd say I could call these games whoo that's close well you know the interesting thing about that it could actually benefit the Steelers if he were down and they could burn a little track here right and just make sure they get into the end so uh yeah detail we saw a similar play in the first quarter which was initially ruled two cuts and then it was spotted inside the one previous play is under review you know and now those timeouts that Baltimore took earlier in the game when we didn't think they were going to be very significant those timeouts are pretty significant now all scoring plays again reviewed upstairs taking a look at this right now to see if he does indeed get into the end zone and clearly the next big thing if we did get in is what are they going to call for the twopoint conversion some Blakeman comes over possession possession meaning that or a little short yeah let's need there it is right there hmm I think he's short I think they have to run another play and there's another significant part of this guy whimper is now in the game so they're down to their third tackle on that side now going against drill Suggs and then right there yeah so that's where the ball is gonna be spotted at about the nine inch line so now let's say that they don't make it on first down Baltimore is almost forced to take their remaining time out some bizarre way provided they eventually score that actually helps the Pittsburgh Steelers but again I mean they've got to get it into the end zone you start fooling around with playing with the clock here and you don't know what can happen we've been talking about the battle Mike Adams drill Suggs almost gets there and goes down around the knees so that was a bit of a ticking bomb on that side and now with guy whimper who knows after review the play the receivers right knee was down with a ball position for Pittsburgh so 152 again Baltimore have spent two timeouts earlier in the half what would die whimper the number three tackle in there and now the Ravens because of that time lapse able to get their big defensive lineman in the game only allowed a couple rushing touchdowns all year see now with the the different set of circumstances when they were able to make that substitution the various web came bursting through but there's that timeout though reckless take their third and final timeout okay it's a heck of a play by a corner to shoot through there and make that play in the backfield but they not they didn't even get back to the line of scrimmage on that one pastor run what do you think it's tough I don't think you can just drop back and throw one with Ben standing back there for any period of time I mean guy whimpers been sitting over on the sidelines going to get sucks they're on the right hash makes it tougher to do some kind of a move play this way there's Mike Adams I'm thinking you're going to get some kind of a pick play out of this one you know you're going to get some quick rob a pick and somebody's sneaking underneath you get the bunch down here to the right a lot of crossing action and see if you can't free somebody up second and goal bell swings on the outside it goes flying but he's in for the touchdown it looked like they had him stopped but he's very low so he goes into the end zone he scores to make it a twopoint game but the helmet went off and clearly he is in distress oh my good and Jimmy Smith is down to the rule now is the play ends immediately when the helmet comes off but my goodness helmettohelmet clearly smith comes in i thought he had possession crossing the line at least that is that helmet was coming off he took the second blow so both guys are still down and what a shot taken clearly could see it on the replay obviously the the helmettohelmet blow the concern about bail right now their rookie running back who then a late start this year because of a foot injury and now you've got a situation where you get two guys you're thinking about one in particular it's a twopoint game a twopoint conversion to come and fortunately bill getting up and even the Ravens fans giving them a nice ovation here but you know this is a bitter rivalry but a classy one and I'll tell you there's something else going to go on here right now too because it was ruled a touchdown they're going to review this now the instant the helmet comes off and you pointer to this out Kristen when the helmet comes off the play is over so as they review it with Bill wofully going back to the sideline if the helmet is off before the ball is across the goal line this won't count one constitutes offed that's off that's what crosses the line it sure it looks like it yeah listen if I had to guess right now I think they're gonna put this ball again at about the sixinch line because the helmet is off and when the helmets off that's the end of the play Jerry or forward progress nothing else that's it right there oh boy so they look at it and they're going to give him the touchdown they already took a look at him upstairs and gained the touchdown now the twopoint conversion so dryer has to come to the running button now over yeah no I think I think Blakeman may have let him up to the line before they reviewed it he's playing is that a review that's what I thought I mean it there's no way they're gonna let this go with that Blakeman coming over and looking under the hood well you know what the replay official does he takes every minute to review that thing and until they get to the line of scrimmage he can still be looking at it back and forth but I have seen that one before the minute that helmet comes off it is it's done and it is completely off there and the ball is not across the line Trevor boys at the play with Jason wouldn't wear the helmet came off and he ran about 15 more yards and and then they put this rule into a fun well and the reasons are obvious I mean and it's a good rule but an unfortunate rule for lay beyond Bell who gave himself up for that touchdown and now it's going to be take it back well if it if it's not a touchdown it's still gonna be third down and obviously two more shots at the end zone so figure I mean this is crazy you got Miller who looks like he's in but then they take it back then they don't get in with Bell then they get into a bell but they may take this back because his helmet came off Bell is hurt wires in it and it may all benefit the Steelers it's hitting two this time if they are burning time off the clock here I mean it's the most bizarre ending I think I've seen to a football game nuances of this wings coming into play it's it's crazy all right here's Blakeman after the play there's helmet came off with the ball positioned at the 1/2 yard line by hole killed with don't we turn down and goal at the one yard line Pittsburgh well as we surmised no bail the other backs are Felix Jones and Jonathan Dwyer and again obviously afford that situation so though get to Christ and trying to get into the end zone and still need the twopoint conversion now will Johnson the fullback comes into the game as well running back in Erica two blocks somebody's Johnson number 46 the right slot and walk this burgers going to throw and it will be cracked at the goal line by will Johnson James ahead of Oh is their fourth down I think it would have been a touchdown had he caught it he leaned it over the line James he had a bow with his second big play and oh my goodness it is just a train wreck down here for the Steelers now Fernando velasca the sinner who replaced marques Pouncy goes down so you got your starting center at least tonight's starting center your one and two left tackles and your starting running back who will all be out of the game that's Cody Wallace who's a tackle by trade and the backup Center getting in some snapping practice here because he's gonna have to snap it on fourth down take a look at we can see what happened to Fernando Velasco OD not a right here it just rolls right back on the back of his leg you can't make this stuff up can't disagree with the call he's got news catch it and it's a touchdown so they tend to velasco fourth and goal we'll ask go back to the sideline and you see Mike Tomlin they're said to take him out I mean he was still trying to determine whether or not he could go back on the field the last minute he said take him out and so now here we go with Cody Wallace and you wonder if this limits does he do shotgun snap well as they take have they taken a snap on the sidelines I mean so many things come into play at this point it's only a half a yard could pin his quarterback sneak it but you got a Lodi not in there there's everything in play it's the longest half yard 1,000 first camp in the back field next to Roethlisberger he does brown in the slot to the right what this burden fires packs down sorry who's his main man in the red zone cautery with only thirty four receptions coming into the game but seven of those four touchdown they switch it off Cory Graham thinks he's supposed to switch this off this pic but the inside defender doesn't do it so they end up with a walkin so all that mess that we just went through and all it did was take time off the clock for the Ravens to try to go the other way zooming they can get this twopoint conversion metaphor ravenous la patrie water Wallace with a snack the first one was good say no hits the ground Emmanuel Sanders put the hold on Jackie Brown was there with the coverage so it's an unsuccessful twopoint conversion but still an onside kick opportunity for Pittsburgh couldn't hold on and a chance kind of goes right through his arms so two balls that were definitely catchable didn't work 22 to 20 obviously an onside kick to come in Pittsburgh of course in a position where if they can recover it they would have a timeout and then you need a field goal to win the game is right let's go to Michelle well meanwhile running back levy on bail was taken back to the locker room as you saw he is being treated for a possible concussion this is a young man who said it was his dream to play on Thanksgiving he was lit up all week about it couldn't wait had a fine performance but back there being treated for a possible concussion now Thank You Michelle and there's velasco we saw beach and canal so Adams come out it's off the foot of suiza me then you have to go back to the motion by suiza on the kick I've never seen one botched in that way has to go 10 yards before Pittsburgh can recover now he's going to switch around now he's going to kick it off his left foot not go the required distance man so he tries to fool them by initially looking he's kicking one way than the other then goes back to the original way and the flag is through the kick being out of bounds and not going ten yards it's interesting did that ball go out of bounds or was it an illegal touch by a stealer before it got out of bounds because it never made at the 10 yards and Jericho Khatri on the tail end of that recovered the ball it was it was actually off of I think Marcus Wheaton touched it first illegal touching 89 to fight a fit and ball spot first down you know the double trickery and the left footed kick it's not the Pittsburgh Steelers you know sometimes you can trick yourself in the things but what a football game I tell you if they played 16 straight times and they wanted us to do them all I would go 35 it's just a fantastic ride so nine of the last ten if this one holds that 22 20 will be decided by three or fewer points Pittsburgh takes its final timeout but born war can end the game on to kneel down we have to think a little bit about the Pittsburgh Steelers now moving forward with the rash of injuries they got there on that last little series well they're going to be five and seven they have three of the last four at home right now you got Denver New England Indian sensi as the division leaders Kansas City would be the number one wild card at the moment of Baltimore would be number two as this game comes to a finish the others are in the hunt but a huge win for the Baltimore Ravens and a bitter loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers a week and a half think on the Miami Dolphins while the Ravens try to again only as well and take on the Minnesota Vikings here they have Minnesota at Detroit New England and at Cincinnati there's not a reminder remainder of their schedule John Madden marking his balance right now we'll find out who the player players of the game are coming up right after these messages from your local NPCs days you
