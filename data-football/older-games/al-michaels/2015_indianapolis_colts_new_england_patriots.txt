============================================================

the time Indianapolis is a warm and welcoming city but not tonight because one mr. Tom Brady miss phaedra September running into town to take on the Gulf's on Sunday night the roof is closed at Lucas Oil Stadium on the edge of downtown since 2008 a much anticipated matchup tonight Tom Brady was playing in some other solar system thus far this season and his Patriots come in to face Andrew Luck in the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday Night Football now my close Cris Collinsworth Michele if the boy it's a game that both teams had circled on their calendar when the schedule came out last spring and the Patriots come in smoking hot for know looking every bit like the Super Bowl champions they are playing very well on both sides of the ball and tonight they were taking on the Indianapolis Colts with the hottest quarterback right now in the NFL and Tom Brady the cult started the season coming out of the gate stumbling with two losses but now they have won three in a row a record with three and two on top and the AFC South but the big question all week has been with Andrew Luck battling a shoulder issue throwing shoulder be ready tonight he is he and Chris we've watched him in practice on Friday you watched him throw tonight what you think he's throwing up pretty well you know maybe not quite the same zip that we've seen out of him in the past but it doesn't matter tonight's more about leadership for Andrew Luck this is a Patriots team that has embarrassed him and all four tries that he's had against them so he had no choice he had to plan he has to lead it's just one of those kinds of moments tonight let's talk about the Patriots we all know the Colts blew the whistle which led to what we know is deflate gate they can say only wants another game and we have seen it since opening night this Patriots team has played with an intensity a borderline anger that maybe we haven't seen since 2007 and you can only imagine the emotion of Tom Brady and his teammates tonight as they take the field and somehow someway the Colts know they have to try and match the intensity of Tom Brady it's the marquee matchup of week six it's the NFL's virgin for Sunday night well as you know if you follow the NFL quite the buildup to this one especially in New England for more on that down of the field and Michele Tafoya Michele well al the DNA of this rivalry was altered completely during the AFC Championship game when the Colts maids a claim that the Patriots were playing with underinflated footballs will this week the media tried and tried to get the Patriots to talk about the revenge factor and the results were predictable I'm always pretty motivated is anyone pulling the side in the grocery store well as long as Bill Belichick has been the head coach the Patriots have made it a policy to let their actions do the talking so tonight with the Patriots have their own Michelle to that point what's happened the last few times they've met the last two regularseason games the Patriots have outscored them 101 to 44 you're throwing the two playoff games both blowouts 88 29 so in the last four meetings combined 189 to 73 you go back before luck got here and the Patriots have won overall six straight counting postseason Stephen foul ski will kick off for the New England Patriots they won the toss and as they always do they defer Bill Belichick loves to have the ball at the end of the first half and then start the second half with it you're so wailing back there Gronkowski will await his turn we're gonna see luck right away as Indianapolis will get go from the Indiana State Capitol Waymon about six yards here Patriots Dharana Farman their free safety and special team star makes the stop here's the cold starters Andrew Luck Stamper crane boy do you Tiwa Hilton FIU Andre Johnson for you Dwayne Allen Clemson Coby Fleener Stanford Anthony Costanzo Boston College Jack Newhart the Ohio State University call it Holmes USC q Thornton Illinois Joe Wright's Western Michigan Goran Andre Johnson two longtime stars in their first years here were first played in San Francisco Andre in Houston and off we go the Johnson along the sideline covered there by Logan Ryan so Andre Johnson who scored two touchdowns in their win a week and a half ago on a Thursday night at Houston starts by making a catch on the first play from scrimmage one thing you know if you're gonna play the Patriots is your other receivers are going to have to make plays somebody other than T Y Hilton that's a good start prints up to the 27 yard line the former 49er bore chugging his way at the age of 32 for a gain of four Jamie Collins makes the tackle on so Andrew Luck in his first three games one win two losses five touchdowns he had 40 last year to leave the league and seven interceptions in those three games he said he hurt himself at the end of the third game against Tennessee but did lead them to a victory by second down and six now from the 31 yard line making the catch just off the turf is Dwayne Allen just above the surface for a game out to the 35 yard line setting up a third down and two let's take a look at Andrew Luck see how that motion is right now that clearly he's had a lot of work done on that shoulder he hasn't really put any zip on a throw yet but he's trying to control it it'd be perfectly honest when we watched him in practice I thought Matt Hasselbeck threw it a little bit harder the luck is going to try and make do out here tonight do the best again Hasselbeck led them to two wins against Jacksonville and then despite being sick all week against makes the catch so Andrew Luck begins with a couple of passes to the left side and backtoback first downs then I'll bring Jamie Collins on the Blitz right here jack new hoard who moved over to left guard from right tackle earlier picks him up but that it's a good sign an Andrew Luck I think learned a little something from Matt Hasselbeck in his starts it's OK to get the ball out quickly and it's one of the things that pep Hamilton wants to do to help him tonight they don't want him holding the football they just signed the Bradshaw he was here last year broke his leg he was out of football until the play fake to him it's wide open for a gain of six let's take a look at the New England starter Rob Nick of its Purdue Alan branch university of michigan silver Salina Utah challenge owns Syracuse University dammit Colin 7 me Giraud Mayo Tennessee Jonathan Frannie broker now from Bob West Alabama universe Patrick Chung the Ducks Devin McCourty Rucker Logan Ryan Rutgers one key guy not here is the great linebacker Dante Hightower who was injured in the game at Houston inactive tonight not even on the trip hassle back on the sideline at the age of 40 leading them to those two wins taken down by McCourty gain of 23 Wayne Allen's going to come down on a strap right there and spring this out nice block down the field by Khalid Homs and could not have had a better start to this game a couple of completions and now you get Frank Gore going this is a good start for the Colts at the 25yard line Bradshaw flanking luck in the backfield it's Phillip Dorsett their number one great choice she went in motion for the slot on the right side Tony quarantine five yard penalty Anthony Costanza Chris you know we talked about I described it as a shoulder issue because the Colts have been very circumspect and Lux been very circumspect as to exactly what it is what do you think well whatever it is he said he's gotten a lot of massage a lot of treatment he doesn't think it's anything serious it's just the soreness and we sort of hinted around about you know with Drew Brees we were saying he can only throw it 25 yards and he kind of smiled and knocked it a little bit so we'll find out how far you can throw one once we get into the game first and 15 former giant and the cult who goes to the 26 yard line so they made the trade for Trent Richardson that didn't work out and then they picked up Frank Gore and Bradshaw gets a hand a popular player here we saw him break his leg in the New England game last year he was out of football until last week they brought him in and right now he's in there to back up Frank Gore and if you want to talk about intensity playing running back you can't do a whole lot better than a mod Bradshaw and Frank Gore they are going to match any intensity anybody can break so a pepper Hamilton the offensive coordinator calling in the plays this is what he's dialed up on second and 11 to the left side talk to the 16 goes the tight end and that'll make it third down and a yard yard to have just the fourman rush but watch the protection here for Andrew Luck earlier this year that was a major factor they reshuffled this offensive line and from that moment on they seem to be much better that and the fact that clearly tonight we're seeing a little different Andrew Luck a much quicker release third down and one now go with two tight ends luck empties the backfield we'll be a first down Malcolm Butler makes the stop but Indy keeps moving first down just enough here on the tail end of this thing by Donte Moncrief just give a little bit of an edge getting out there for Jack Doyle to catch that thing and die for the first down little taste of their own medicine who's Donte Moncrief lays a little pick on the Patriots the strive began at the 11yard line they picked up four first downs along the way at the 13 yard line it'll be second down and nine the Patriots on early downs trying to keep those two deep safeties back there Matt Patricia feeling this way here so he's hoping that with his front seven they can handle the running game inside big night tonight to try and get some pressure from these defensive ends they have good pass rushers they're going to have to try an impact Andrew Luck as you can see no TDS on the opening drive and the equivalent of a season plus five games 21 games since the Colts have scored a touchdown on their opening drive second and nine at the six and trying to get the first dynasty wide open as they come into spot it appears to be a little bit short of the first it's going to be third down and inches the strait zone defense a little unusual just going to circle back inside here Tampa to defense where the soft spot was so let's say it's Andrew Luck is seeing the field he is not anxious he's not nervous sometimes you hit him with a little different defense out there then maybe what they typically play he read it perfectly well he's only seven for seven lucky fill in 57 yards are a lot Tipton is the running back they fake it to him just throw that away so good coverage chase that by Rob mint kovitch and now it's fourth down and one so it appears they're going to leave the offense in Ning kovitch managed to get outside just enough to keep the pressure on lock their butt here we go well I can you know you think of the fact that New England's going to score Bellatrix going to run down there to get a closer look at the alignment he wants to see how the coast line up does he want to take a timeout he's only down at the 16 yard line Tipton is the running back bill does not call a timeout and look Rosie three for the touchdown they enforce me a check a lot of people thought this would be a blowout from the start the Colts have other ideas did montcrief controlled it and stay in bounds before he went onto the chalk remember it's a fourth that way and remember Annie is the same as two feet I think the knee is going to be down very close to but when the elbow was well boy almost simultaneously they're looking at New York what hits first I think it was the knee if I had to put a stake in the ground Tony Curran T we'll take a look and he has the leader not after reviewing the play the ruling on the field is confirmed touchdown any karate seeing what you're going to see in a moment we have the definitive angle right there does the knee hit first or the elbow very clear need down have control controls it all the way to the ground Butler with the coverage 13 plays 89 yards and another Angeles one der Adam Vinatieri 20th year in the league first part of his career of course with the Patriots ending in the middle of the last decade and the extra point he's going to be in a shootout ghost word 1/4 of wanted face offensive music deserves headline this fabulous rivalry the years hovercraft stifling a yawn watching his team pushy his own since the mid90s his team fall behind against Buffalo 7nothing and it wasn't Yahner from there they haven't trailed very often this year less than six minutes out of 240 minutes coming into the game tonight touch back let's take a look at the Patriots starters Tom Brady Michigan Dion Lewis Pitt Julian Edelman Penn State Danny Amendola Texas Tech Rob Gronkowski Arizona Michael Williams Marcus cannon Texas Christian University a sin Georgia to David Andrews Georgia Josh Sean Penn State Sebastian Ballmer as you were watching those intros at the jet planes coming through the building here because everybody is standing and drinking and going oh they love the Patriots here from the 20 the crowd already in full faith in you indeed that he gets it away there's a flag on the other side of the fields a threeyard pickup for Julian Edelman and Tony Clemente will tell us all about it it looked like Trent Cole may have jumped a little early on that one outside defense number 58 longtime Philadelphia Eagle Brian Grigson their general manager went out he got a lot of older players it's almost as if they brought in the Pro Bowl alumni group Johnson and Cole we also brought in some pretty talented young defensive linemen and that's where they had been beaten in the past two rookie defensive tackles each played at Stanford Anderson intended for Gronkowski covered by Jackson so Tom Brady tie in a team record tonight 212th start with the Patriots we asked him if he knew about that last night I said no he said he said hoot hoot hoot whose record on my time Bruce Armstrong he said is a great guy Armstrong was playing his last year when gratings in his first Gareth one that comes into the game he's the back after Lewis had started it second down his guard and what bulldozes his way out to the 29 yard line a yard short of the first down for LeGarrette Blount he has been a bit of a nightmare for sports defense but you typically don't see a lot of him in the first half just six first half carries compared with 27 in the second but after the success he's had against this team I think Bill Belichick said let's get him out there Louis on the sidelines on third down and a half er off times Brady goes right to the line for a sneak not this not this time folks are able to make some changes lunch stays in the backfield he sneaks it anyway as he has done so proficiently for so many years and the first down at the 31 yard line it was right in behind the rookie Center david andrews who has not missed the snap this season i think as long as you leave a gap open as they did here between the guard and the center i almost think it's automatic that tom is just going to take it that a lot of teams now we'll stack somebody on either side of the center trying to take that away but as long as you don't defensively you can almost count on I'm gonna have finished in the opening quarter remain those are on top seven nothing and green by Hammond or Danny Amendola up to the 38 yard line gain of seven Erik Walden the linebacker makes the stop second down and three the one change up front now for the New England Patriots Marcus cannon takes over for one of their best players Nate's older at the left tackle position he is there all season long but Nate's older a very good player and the only firstround draft pick on this entire office why that's Lewis the running back at the bottom of the screen Brady receiver to the 43 let's take a look at the Colts defense come to Langford and David Perry Stanford Henry Anderson Stanford Erik Walden don't know how to coil Jackson Marilyn Jarell Freeman Mary harden Bailey Trent Cole Cincinnati correct old st. Paul's polish Mike Adams Delaware Blue Hens white Lowry from San Jose State Vontae Davis double senior high school DC last week in Houston a couple of interceptions made by Mike Adams Bregman husky is the defensive coordinator sort of a revamp defense was silly old is starting defense in the league even with the two rookies in there and wing has been able to just in the last several meters second down and seven he swings it over the middle and that's caught by Scott Chandler in his first year as a patriot after several seasons in Buffalo first down at the 36 yard line couple of plays ago we saw Marcus Cannon who remember is the backup left tackle and he looks like he's limping around maybe something on that right foot area and that would be major news stays in there for the moment and overtakes it all the way down the middle to the 11 yard line tackled by dwight lowry brady going hurry up no huddle well the one thing the Colts did not want to see in this game the catch and run the yards after the catch and that one couldn't have been any easier three minutes to go Oh Lois it'll be second down in ten Diablos what a story he is came up with Philadelphia a couple of years then went to Cleveland broke his leg didn't play football for two years even though he was in the Indianapolis camp last year for one week they brought him in week two he was inactive then they let him go and Bill Belichick to the Patriots had their eye on him and signed him to a futures contract on New Year's Eve last year and set a pretty good future this year when the Colts let him walk out of here I think that qualifies as a oops has been sensational the most elusive running backs in the game second to 10 and the Patriots take a China in the south is a weak division so India's on top he's the one today they beat Jacksonville on Tennessean the Jaguars are just one win apiece after the timeout second down and 10 down from the one caste split wide to the left Grady that's pointed into the endzone for the touchdown goes Julian Edelman Rhaenys favorite target this season what a year he's having Edelman for the touchdown well the Colts are just rushing three and watch Tom Brady step up on the move make a very accurate throw they're taking some of their best pass rushers on the outside you see Robert Mathis out there and instead of rushing him off the edge they're trying to get a hit on those slot receivers that time it simply did not work Edelman made a mess Edelman already now with 36 catches in four games plus a quarter that's his fourth touchdown catch Stephen gustas B for the extra point and each team drives the length of the field on its first possession Indiana State Capitol on a Sunday night Julian Edelman scoring the touchdown but may have paid a price here look at Frank Gore we're gonna show you heaven in a second as we start with the touchback here and here what settlements what we were talking about Chris Sanford the cash there we go and I hate to put it in these terms but if you're going to hurt a finger that's the one you hope for is a receiver because you can tape it to the finger next to it and most of the catching ability with your hands comes with the inside fingers and your thumb so you'll see yeah maybe you won't he's just gonna take that thing right up and see what happens I'd rather have a root canal Frank Gore is the running back from the 20 yard line on first down three all right let's take a look back here's 2014 and what that motion looks like really driving through it so far tonight we've seen a little less of that a little bit more of load on the fall and that's sort of what we saw in practice now it doesn't mean he can't do it but the pass is so far he hasn't had to really step in and drive for the 26 yard line in and out of the hands of Frank Gore and it's Jonathan free me right there who nearly had the interception kind of dropped the elbow on that one and it got away from him as he stepped up and turned to throw it really fortunate that that thing did not get away watch his right elbow sort of dip under and when you do that the ball is going to sail whether you're a pitcher or otherwise so third down and seven now at the 23 yard line pointing at everybody else false start offense number 31 fiveyard penalty remains there down he met 81 he met Andre Johnson Andre Johnson a little history with that man Chuck Pagano actually recruited him at the University of Miami Johnson played their Frank Gore played there as well 12 get to the first down Walker he shoved back just a little shy of it and that'll make it fourth down and to quite a bit of zone defenses out of both of these teams you just get the feeling that they're really not wanting to do this whole matchup on the outside and here you go championship game he was being followed by everybody including Devin McCourty over the top of him almost on every snap so far haven't really seen that but still that too deep safety to be having just a spin who's this one to the 16 yard line a flag is thrown down the sideline he's going to come back he's going to get tackled at the 46 yard line but the flag came out right away as he began the run back in the coast defense only they're going all the way down to about the 20 yard line figuring this one is going to come back as it normally does on a return of that nature it looked like Devin McCourty right at the point of the catch gave a little shove we'll start Deepa that our own territory 77 in Indianapolis there's their left tackle Marcus cannon taking the place of the injured Nate soldier to begin with he's back in the locker room thus Sebastian glommer goes to left back on Cameron Fleming who is just activated this week is the new right tackle with his juggling and shuffling along that Patriot offensive front continues meanwhile he got jumping the defense the past Edelman lament a first down should be a free play that might be coal again has already been flagged once but this time they will take the play because the gain of 13 outside defense number 58 in the neutral zone the time results of the play is a first down let's go to Michelle LaMarcus cannon went to the locker room al he had his right big toe examined by team doctors along the sideline he is questionable with that toe injury all right Thank You Michelle we saw him going back to the locker room the shuffling up front you got a rookie Center the left side swimming just activated and dropping it right over the middle will be second down and ten I won't see that one very often of course whenever Julian Edelman drops the ball you wonder whether or not the he's thinking a little bit about that hand perfectly thrown here hit him right in the face mask let's say the one thing you do not want as a football team is to get hit hard with injuries at the same position and right now the tackle position is that position for the Patriots couple of seasons it's not up to the 24yard line short game really wind makes the tack that will be third down and seven as we took down to the final minute of the opening quarter right here is going to play off of this doubleteam get himself back into that play anytime the Garrett one goes on the ground this crowd goes crazy because they haven't seen it very often in Indy with those two defensive tackles both played at Stanford 3rd down and 7 up in the 24 and a whistle before the snap timeout had been taken so Tom Brady of course every quarterback loves a clean pocket with no contact and all the rest so his numbers right there very very good when he gets contact there he's outside the pocket even better in terms of the pass reading quite in contrast to last year those are his numbers for the whole season for TDs and six interceptions when he was either contacted around side of the fire so that's a significant difference from last season for him yeah and you see he said he has worked very hard this offseason he saw those numbers he knew what they were we worked really hard on that part of his game and escaping outside the pocket as well and center rose and that is caught that's Edelman that crossing wrote and that's a first down up to the 33 yard line when adapt Kol Julian's number that's four catches for him in the quarter ever seen a situation where sometimes the little brother gets more upset when the big brother gets attacked the big brother does Julian Edelman has sort of carried that burden that's a twoyard gain by one and that's going to take us to the second quarter so after one it's New England seven something like before zooms at business tonight aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico down Indianapolis Sunday night Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya Sunday Night Football second and nine as we begin the second quarter side with Brady shoulder shape go back outside to hold it in and Keshawn Martin for a gain all the way down to the 27 yard no idea I think that was Greg Toller out there look like because Gronkowski was wide open underneath he basically knocked Mike Adams to the ground look like Toller reacted to Gronkowski and just gave up the deeply McMartin up in a trade with the Texans in the 27 again now it's incomplete running away with it was told her but did not very far second down to ten so we all know the rules now I think we all know the rules now it catch two feet down and be able to make some sort of a move related to that catch to escape and not enough time on that catch the key is you think we know there have been a few this year that think anybody knows second I'm in ten minute Louis in the backfield and this time it's Edelman but not very far Toller shadowing him and that will set up a third down and five at the 22 josh mcdaniels calling in the play this Patriots team just so good when they can get third down and six or less but very very average beyond that and it is right on the border here third and five of the 22 this book then tasks you lied to the right send Edelman that way as well again escape straws to incomplete intended for Danny Amendola so Brady got another trouble avoided the sack but now his fourth and five and in comes the field goal unit one of the things they wanted to do was to force Dion Lewis to block Brady had to escape there might have been able to run for that first down they have plenty of attention for Gronkowski coming across the middle as always there was your first down though of Tom Brady had seen about that woman 19 straight longest curves Street off the foot of Gustafsson 40yard attempt down and once again perfection into the second quarter and the Patriots take a threepoint lead the hit drama Chicago Fire is back this Tuesday's episode will push the entire house to the brick and all the Chicago Fire you'll see it after the voice this Tuesday night right here on NBC truck pagano's pedigree is defense that's who he's coaching them along the sidelines Brett muskie is their defensive coordinator it's a 107 ballgame touched back here Andrew Luck in the pocket and when he's out of the pocket were contacted when it's clean pretty good for two DS two interceptions but when he gets contacted or outside the pocket quite a contrast to the way it's been in the past one td5 picks and remember he missed two games so that's over his three games coming into this one tonight and when I think of Andrew Luck I sort of think of Ben Roethlisberger you know how Roethlisberger's is big guy in the pocket and people sort of fall off of him and that's the way luck has played a little bit but tonight he's been much quicker getting the ball out of his hands and I think his offensive lineman critically appraised here Frank Gore getting it too you know so many subplots and side stories to this game you know most of them another one that would be Chuck Pagano is in his fourth year in Annapolis coached it's the last year of his contract he's won 11 regular season games in each of the first three years they offered him a oneyear extension he said no I'm gonna play it out and bet on myself yeah and he said the one thing that cancer definitely has taught me is that I'm going to live for today I'm going to bet on my team and my players and that's exactly what he's doing from the 22 yard line now it's second down and eight a month free to haul it in up at the 40yard line in a nineteen well let's dismiss any concerns about Andrew Luck shoulder he just stepped into this one and drove it hard right down the middle of the field perfectly time but once again hitting that back foot and getting the ball out look at that protection around him Anthony Costanzo terrific that time up at the 42 yard line inside handoff for up to the 46 yard line McCourty makes the tackle it'll be second down and five they just think that Frank Gore has made all the difference in the world for this Colts team this is a team that I think Andrew Luck has had what 1 100 yard rusher and the entire time that he's been here and yet this guy knows how to run the football so many years in San Francisco but watch how low he gets running the back always falling forward for that extra 2 or 3 yards Andre Johnson covered by Ryan third and five well Frank Gore came out of Miami went to San Francisco the first few years were pretty lean then the team got very good very durable sixty six straight starts eleven thousand three hundred ninety rushing yards and ten consecutive seasons steady solid consistent and they say they can't get me to talk about anything but football how's your family that's good but I can't believe I stumbled upon his nature just slings it away that was Dominique Easley who came in and forced the throw it will be fourth down that was pretty much everybody having success here comes easily off the top into this and watch him he sort of set that back and was almost ready to jump to try and knock it down then when Locke pulled it down went after him New England doesn't call that many blitzes but they did there and correct he has to have a little bit of a I think it's whether or not he was in or out of the pocket whether it's intentional grounding or not might be the issue well and the other issue there was that was the first time that we've seen luck have to make a really awkward throw and immediately you think how did his shoulder hold up to that kind of a release and almost well now we're on new standing there one of the officials may need a little time out himself so correct he calls a timeout we'll be back coming to you from Indianapolis at McAfee 2part Danny and 11 yard line and the official wheat we needed a timeout for a moment because the official time it was the line judge and it was yep there was a rare Oh ran into him the barn wants and an extra moment and that's why we had the officials timeout had to go through the protocol over there back in tough wine Joyce baby didn't make him sit out of light now the Patriots from there his deal incomplete than before Danny Amendola again Brady working behind that makeshift offensive line Billy wind came charging through to force at that time second down Billy Wynne is having a night here so far watch the quick move inside and nobody picks him up he just goes straight through and drives Tom Brady into the ground can't get the ball out any quicker than that he still got Brady on a second detail Mike Adams pick Grady off twice last year and now you begin to wonder about Edelman that's three times since that finger was either broken or dislocated that he's been unable to hang on to the football well and we're seeing Julian Edelman almost try and catch the ball more with his body and with an underhand catch then I can remember seeing him maybe he just lost a little confidence or it's hurting him but I have never seen Julian Edelman struggle to catch the football like this that was a perfectly thrown ball amazing in this place is rocking now that gives the cult stoolie so that's three juggle or dropped by Edelman now about Mike Adams yeah last week he was Defensive Player of the Week and comes right back with another one here today 12th year in the league he's been around for different his first Pro Bowl last year the extra point by Venna Terry is good and with 11 and a half to go say well julian edelman caught a touchdown pass for New England's touchdown tonight hurt himself dislocated or fractured the finger on the play there it was and since then three bobbles and or drops including this most recent one now watch his right hand the underneath hand is the one that he hurt does it even touch the football and you don't often see Julian Edelman with those underhanded cradle catches here's another one just like it to juggle loose at the 35yard line and the Patriots didn't have the football McDaniel's taking a look into the scrum as well at least the Patriots think they have it they have one called saying we've got it I love this play because they have so many guys right here on the line of scrimmage there's nobody right behind them tremendous takeoff guy is able to put in the spot where his team can get it Hunter extraordinaire and the officials are gathering after announcing that the Colts have the ball let's underneath the patriot player they're fine I don't think he ever quite had control of it the referee is saying that Moncrief Donte Moncrief who is remembered tanning blue is the man who came out with it well he's got it there I'm not sure the officials realized we see the Bulls the courts here comes the challenge flag Gallants playing now coming from the cult sideline meaning that they announced it as the Colts ball but clearly they meant New England and a had a challenge from Pagano far from that not much going on here Indianapolis is challenging the ruling on the field of recovery alright so announced nd had it that was wrong now they signal in room hazard and Pagano makes the challenge in New York to take a peek so a week Toni Kroos but they're basically saying is that there's not enough visual evidence to overturn it Josh Klein is the guy at the bottom for New England 67 and there's the ball coming up and Moncrief comes up with it comes away from the huddle but when they looked at it they said they didn't have the indisputable visual evidence of clear recovery and thus New England still has the ball at the 35 yard Jonathan Newsome finally got to a secondary did its job and the Newsome is able to come in to collect the sack crossing but it was really Newsom who went out in coverage and then came back in and still got the sack Boyard sacks second down and 14 dr. Lewis and the Haitian gonna take off new yard the first flag comes in Mike Adams made the tackle if at the moment is a game of 11 I think it gonna get a face mask here as the Dallas Cowboys will tell you you just reach for Dion Lewis you're not sure what you're going to get and I think was Mike Adams who quite by accident grabbed that facemask just trying to as so many people we saw Dallas a week ago try and get him down around the goal line and there was about six guys that best like that so it would have been a third down and three becomes the first down at the Colt 43 yard line gentlemen have to go in the half Indianapolis up five back easily Gary Coxe a stoppage for the question was on the enforcement of the penalty the boss has been moved up 1/2 the yard all right no timeout I'm starting with you bill so it moves it to the 42 and 3/16 first down angles over the left side takes the ball to the 38 yard line the Colts have basically remade this defensive line that had been run over in the past by LeGarrette Blount and they have done a better job here tonight really Zack Kerr was the only guy that was on this defensive line a year ago that came back and he's inactive tonight it's the Henry Anderson's and the David Perry's in the King wankers second down and six inside the turn chase down touchdown Patriots so much for that for a guy who has just killed the cults in the last couple of seasons to play they loved bringing Jack Mason around and then watch Klein coming down here and getting this block that time blunt instead of following Jack Mason one of the most athletic guards they've ever had in New England he ducked back inside and it looked like the quell Jackson just over ranted a bit there he goes again though it has been a nightmare for this team trying to tackle the gear the extra point is good one but tents 50 yards TV here back and forth we go in this one 1714 Sunday night football brought to you by Nissan innovation that excites by Bud Light make the right call drink responsibly by FanDuel the leader in fantasy football and by fallout 4 available November the 10 that is what they called deflate cake you know that's an over/under out there but how many times will save deflate gate tonight if I heat the plate cake the plate cake the plate pour you in the over they're sucking footballs around town too by going 65 yards in for plays the cautious killing or the patrons killing the Colts on the ground the last two regular season games 361 on the ground last two postseason games for 11 and 9 touchdowns and a lot of that is Blount the last two postseason games and then there was a guy named Jonas Gray who last year came in here ran for almost 200 yards made the cover of Sports Illustrated was late for a meeting the next week and the next thing you know God well he went to camp this year but he's in Miami right now they brought blood back from Pittsburgh and Belichick just guys go guys come back they just Coby Fleener you know it's interesting Chris is that it's Ben Dion Lewis who's been starting the games like going six innings and then the relief pitcher comes in blunt but tonight leave it to Belichick Lewis hasn't carried the ball once then Blunt has five carries yeah well history has a little something to say about that as well when a team struggles and yeah they're better along that defensive line but there is a confidence with this Patriots offensive line especially now with the injuries that they're going through at the tackle position why not go back to what has worked over the years and certainly that has been LeGarrette Blount second down and eight from the 22 yard line pooja and he's able to slide by Butler picked up the first by the Super Bowl hero for gain of 13 and coverage from extreme off position here just going to shoot across there and for Butler just there was no way for him to catch up and so what you're seeing now is a little bit of what we see the Patriots do so often try and get the ball out of Andrew Luck span and allow his playmakers to make friends after the catch territory the Ron Harmon makes the tackle at the 47 end of 18 both guards very good here Jackie you whored over here on the left side and over here a double block on the part of Hugh Thornton who came in to line up about three weeks ago for the specific purpose of getting this running game going they simply were not running the football but Frank Gore now having an edge with this new offensive line for six carries 55 yards tea wide open incomplete second intent one thing Andrew Luck talked about was our receivers have to be ready for contact at the line of scrimmage watch Malcolm Butler come over and get contact here on T y Hilton and then just scramble to catch up does a nice job getting his head turned around but Bella check to us no question about it Malcolm Butler right now is our best cornerback only head Darrelle Revis he's gone Browner's gone a Turing things gone and Butler of course was the man who lived forever in New England Lawrence the interception to see the Super Bowl victory there's making the tackle at the 35yard line is Logan Ryan third a third and five where did Logan Ryan have a good game a week ago against Dallas couple interceptions Lilly has played a lot of that slot position for New England this year which i think is one of the toughest positions in all of football so he stepped up and done a nice job third and six first down 32 yard line the Colts are going to try and run one of these pick plays across here like that but it ended up being his own defense nice call by Matt Patricia to fool him and so luck really with no choice bad shoulder and all had to take off and that was a good choice there not afraid is it mmhmm is a stout proud guy and he wanted to play in this game check out number one overall pick in 2012 his fourth season three tight ends he takes the ball to the 29 yard line that's a gain of five there's the 40year old Matt Hasselbeck came out of his sickbed to lead them to a Thursday night win we could have to go against Houston he was so impressive it would be hard to describe and you wouldn't want us to describe the week that he had leading up to that let's just say he left the meetings a lot that week second down and five from the 29 late at Stanford with two up it picks up the first down one of the things you love about Frank door is his ability to block watch him pick up the blitzing linebacker here and just stone him not even a step after that No Fee Fleenor who had such a big day this last November when they played against the Patriots here 144 yards in that game on seven catches coming up with the big one there and through the backfield here now door comes back e from the slot to the his blockers will but a flag comes in Dana Hey Tony correctiy with the core holding offense number 62 repeat first down that's the center Holmes balsam innate your game yeah just as an Inca bitch here was trying to go for the play watch the arm hook around the helmet of Ning kovitch and pull them to the ground good call some counted homes with the the penalty for 15 remaining in the half the napkin fourth game first and as a teammate comes in we can have interference here dorset the rookie working with Devin McCourty all that a little bit of a forceout I would think oneonone and McCourty of course a safety who used to be a cornerback past interference well that's the first foul on McCourty this year and last year as well he did not have a single foul but he has one here just set up a first out of the 8 yard line Lord he's gonna try and just get underneath him and work his body to push him out of bounds but the officials watch that closely defensive back in this league and that's Jaime Campos athletic is any defender at any position in the National Football League grew up in Mississippi as a quarterback in high school played every position was a track star as well Jamie Collins and talking to the Colts coaching staff they said other than JJ Watt there is nobody in the NFL that we have to specifically game plan more than Jamie Collins he can do anything he can run over your back he can cover he can blitz he is a fantastic player that came up huge in the game against that second down and goal from the Cordys from the quartic is able to save the touchdown and it will be third down and goal one of the things that the Colts are doing here is what the Patriots do so often with Gronkowski just wait to get that right match up so you bring all those tight ends in split them out wide find out the matchup you like best that time against the safety McCourty and Patricia I would think likes that matchup typically they lost that one though Patricia was able to send in five or six different defenders Jack goodness foots out to the right side and on third down and goal New England is going to take big time a quarterback comparison thus far tonight pretty close to the best you know it's kind of what you would expect out of this thing and it's been well played yeah I know that all this stuff coming in to this game but when it got right down to it it was two terrific football teams of course the Colts have won three in a row after that slowish start Tom Brady we all know about his motivation for this one that was really interesting that that last sequence there bees Patricia since five or six different defenders in and then he sees how the Colts line up and they they take the time if they may have had too many guys on the field to begin with and there's Cheung he's trying to wave another he's trying to wave McCourty off the guys come in guys going and they had to take the time out to avoid the penalty third and goal now ordinarily you don't run but this is kind of one of those games that anything can happen in this one and now they're gonna go spread so his first touchdown of the season was a spy on that play watch him follow luck around as soon as luck broke out of the pocket he had to react and then it opened up the slot right in behind it 40 white Hilda tremendous play tremendous play by Andrew Luck not many quarterbacks can find a receiver after making that move with Jamie Collins coming right down his throat tremendous and he worked that throw around him almost a threequarter sidearm throw great play the end zone for the first time the point is good good game back and forth we go to go so then it fell mobile you can watch local and primetime NFL games live on your smartphone log onto nfl.com slash mobile the Patriots have completely changed their kickoff return team now they're not allowing another opportunity and McAfee stick will bound through the end zone another player and evolved and what's taking place over the past nine months Ryan brixon who was the man who contacted the National Football League office about the possible under inflation of footballs which led to you know what and nine months of stuff remember Tom Brady was initially suspended for the first four games of the season that was overturned had that suspension as you look at the ownership the Kraft family of the Patriots had the suspension not been overturned this would've been Grady's first game back instead he comes in four and oh and a prime MVP candidate from the twenty escape his aim and goal Amendola takes it to the indianapolis 45 yard line break Toller finally lashes a man for a game to 35 Amendola just working inside and then once he comes back out his tom brady sort of buying a little time and as that zone defense got stretched there were gaps that Amendola was able to take advantage of but once again now we hit on it a little bit earlier in the game but the movement of tom brady that are making some big plays now takes us to the twominute warning post by four in on the first half and it's been a really good panther football 21:17 Patriots have it they have one timeout at the disposal of balls at the 45 back here and you will go out of bounds at the 38 crotch house keep it a little lonely out there tonight see a lot of coverage that's the only pass thrown to them in the first half and you can run it over the top of them these pass rushers the Robert Mathis is and the trick poles who are only used to rushing the passer are dropping underneath those quick closed and and it really is cause a bit of a disruption second and two well Marcus cannon who started at left tackles and I've remains questionable with a right toe injury he had gone to the locker room he's back out right we see emmechelle and on the sidelines that's created Balmer going to left tackle its created Cameron Fleming it was activated this week on the white tack the third down and two at the 37 yard line not getting to the line the gain is Dion Lewis Bremen makes the tackle and that's going to set up a fourth and one they had exactly what they wanted they've got the star running back out here on the edge and the ball was thrown slightly behind but Freeman was able to catch up to that one really Dion Lewis has to drive off the ball far enough to make sure he has that first down and so here we go so it's the end of one and now Brady's gonna try one fourth and one at the 36 the big more Squad is in the backfield to pick up the first down Julian what a cop I McDaniels in motion takes it and then a spinorama around Walden to get the first down they did too good a job that time both guys understood exactly what that was Walden had it to quell Jackson did it and Julian Edelman just somehow made that work that was dead to rights for 34 this is exactly what New England tries to do when they win the coin awesome they defer 61 in the last 62 times they defer what Belichick loves to do is have the ball at the end of the first half and then get it again in the second day of in effect it's a double play you're getting backtoback possession so they'll take as much time off the clock as they can Patriots out second down and seven when they still have one time at their disposal we're now just about on the field goal range Louis could not hang on third and seven from the clock down to 33 seconds pretty good pressure right there in the face think that was Malthus working against cameron fleming the replacement tackle out there we'll see if he can start to get something going because now instead of always dropping we're seeing a little more pressure out of the Colts 37 they send Gronkowski wide right brady's fires over the middle Adelman makes the catch flag is down and Edelman stand on his feet clock goes to 24 Frank is in the offensive and that's Sebastian Ballmer that takes them out of field goal range remember Sebastian Ballmer now forced to go to the left tackle position instead of his typical right tackle position you see the hands to the face maybe twice on the same play we'll get spotted at the 41 of the course a 59yard field I don't not that the sastra couldn't do it 13:17 here's a big day much better reigns to the 22 and and pick up the first down as well and Brady says let's get up there and Spike it save the timeout by the timeout has already been taken that looked like an avalanche coming at them watch this screen setup here as they get off to this side and now there I mean there's five guys out in front of that thing so defensively you knew it had to be something like that where that is painful to give up one of those in that situation Edelman good block balls 222 look at that again that's a convoy Brady meanwhile is 14 to 23 already thrown for 201 yards little surprise we haven't seen more screens because the Colts keep dropping so many people into coverage and when they do that it's so easy to get it space to try and get behind those big offensive linemen I would expect to see more of that if the Colts tase own matrix Clark was 17 seconds he uses the middle again still spiking said he's gonna go No Toller with Keshawn Martin flag down at the 10 today they will probably call this illegal contact but the ball was in the air when that contact occurred so if they're calling a legal contact house interference sir well officiated there contact right out here well beyond five yards obviously there's the contact and the ball was in the air nice job by the officials and now a big play yeah you could see the ball in the frame pass interference now it's a 7 12 seconds Thank You Patrick appearance so the eggs buffalo bill was pushing off Brady blocking at the official probably not needed Scott Chandler is sixfootseven going up against Toller there's some bumping you can see kind of had his hand on the facemask there and just sort of kept him from jumping himself right there there was plenty of content through this play this game is starting to shape up almost exactly how we thought it might a lot of people thought it might be like twenty four nothing at the half instead it's probably going to be a onepoint game this is a 35yard field goal for steven gustav ski it's a Belichick we're trying to do it again in the first half with the possession and a score and then get the ball again we talked about the fact he always defers when he wins the coin toss double whamming they've done it 14 times since o9 scoring on the final possession of the half and again after receiving the second hand kickoff the only time he ever took the ball was on a rainy day in Cincinnati a few years ago apart from that we defer and it's worked brilliantly you know what was the biggest play of this half with all those big plays in the half is the fact that Donte Moncrief who probably did recover that onside kick was not awarded the ball because you didn't have the conclusive look at it but you can imagine if they have recovered that what this half might have looked like really an excellent half by the Colts as you said there were a lot of people with the way the Patriots have been playing this year that thought this one was going to be a blowout the Indianapolis Colts have matched any emotion that the Patriots brought into this house Patriots big favorites big road favorites coming into the game it's a onepoint game this will be a touchback probable kneel down from the 20yard line the teams will go to the locker room it's been fun yeah really good guy really good game you know and for Andrew Luck he had such a tough start but they were against two really tough defenses that he started this season against the Jets and the bills and really never got it going until the fourth quarter against Tennessee and so the backandforth first half Kings exchanging the leaves greatly still arguing that goal the side judge passed at the second half
