============================================================

that's downtown San Diego on this early Sunday evening and the shores of the Pacific the Balmer from west to face the Chargers on Sunday night night Sunday night where are you 58 degrees clear skies in San Diego regular season or the Chargers Philip Rivers will lead his club against Rey back after missing four games with a toe injury and the Baltimore Ravens on NBC's Sunday Night Football now Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya welcome to San Diego lengthy at stake tonight first the Baltimore Ravens come in with the mark of ten and three and no matter what happens the rest of the way if they went out if they go to 13 and three they will be the number one seed in the AFC after playing seven playoff games on the road the last three years so the road to the Super Bowl would go through Baltimore on the AFC side they won four in a row now the charges have won their last two after a sixgame losing streak they are 6 &amp; 7 at the moment but right back in the race they've got two presidents today New England beat Denver Detroit beat Oakland so here are the San Diego Chargers in position to try to take advantage of that and Kristen I can't remember ever talking about a team having a sixgame losing streak in 40 years this decision that he Bengals intoduce emiti and being in position to get to the playoffs but here we are here we are again and as usual Phillip Rivers and the San Diego Chargers saving their best football for the month of December this is a team that's hot they're dangerous and if they get in the playoffs you think maybe they can make some noise problem is to get in the playoffs they're probably going to have to knock off the Baltimore Ravens we're playing as well as anybody right now and that's a tough task on the AFC side there's so many good teams right now someone is legit Super Bowl contenders how do the Ravens stack up in your monitor right now I think the Baltimore Ravens are the best team in the AFC and they would be my choice to represent the AFC in the Superbowl and as you look at their schedule the rest of the way this is without question their toughest test so if the Ravens could come out take care of business tonight I didn't really think we're gonna see them an Indianapolis for years a great defense in Baltimore we know about Lois and all that Reed terrell suggs having a fun he and his Ravens against the Antonio Gates could be a recordsetting light for him on Sunday Night Football NBC sports home of Super Bowl 46 welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League on this 18th night of December the race for the number1 seed the Patriots have already won but the Ravens as we said at the top if they went out they are number one period the Steelers and Texas also involved in that scramble for the number one seed in the AFC West here we are because the Chiefs knocked off Green Bay today and with everything else that happened every one of those teams could still win the division the Broncos on top then there the Raiders the Chargers try to get to 7 and 7 and if all four teams wound up eight and eight and that's possible the Chiefs would win the AFC West go figure North turnin is this season as the San Diego head coach on the field with Michele Tafoya el Thank You coach with Denver losing you're now still in the race for both the division and the wildcard so what are your priorities tonight as you face a very talented Baltimore team well we've done some guys back the last couple of weeks and we're playing as good with them playing we're playing a great team's home you know we just gotta play our best Philip Rivers went through a tough stretch during your losing streak but the last couple of weeks he's looked like himself what does he need to do to get you in the end zone tonight well we need to protect him we need to run the ball and then he needs the plate within themselves and not try to make something happen that's not there thank you injured his toe a week ago is active tonight not sure if he'll start not sure if they'll return punts but he is active and he is concerned al that he might not be able to last the entire game and that would be big Michelle because Jimmy Smith the rookie would take his spot and the Chargers would figure to go that way a lot John Harbaugh has really done a magnificent job in his four seasons with Baltimore getting them to the playoffs in each season they have clinched a playoff spot by virtue of what happened around the conference today Nick Novak will kick off San Diego won the toss and elected to defer so they didn't want their offense going against a Baltimore defense at the outset there's tons of ikaw speed to run it back for the Raven so this crowd is fired up now because of what happened earlier today in the AFC West and here we go from San Diego and so the caste will balance in the end zone and let's take a look at the Ravens office Joe Flacco the University of Delaware Ray Rice Rutgers University Vontae League East Carolina Anquan Boldin Florida State University Torrey Smith Maryland Edie Dixon Morgan ducks Ron King you our university could Network Marshall Yanis Iowa Michael War University of Oh good job protecting Joe Flacco's so the Ravens having won their last poor start from the 20yard line the running back leads the league in some scrimmage turns the corner here picks up a first down on the opening Brian takes it out to the 41 yard tripped up by Eric little a 21yard game go so many times when you see big runs there are people on the ground right here Antonio Garre the nose tackle is going to get cut on the backside by Marshall yonder and here we go the Chargers with some banged up inside linebackers and you have to believe that the Ravens are going to come out tonight and force the Chargers to prove that they can stop the run Chargers basically thinking what's left Flacco beat us and that Ray Rice but rice already with a big Dean on first down now he runs into his own guys here and gets taken down through so on Phillips will get brentd for the tackle Flacco picked in the first round out of Delaware originally enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh were Tyler Powell on the job so joke transferred fourth year in the league take a look at his numbers here the numbers are okay but all things considered when he talked to anybody around the Ravens they will tell you the clock was having his best reason well and he was the guy that orchestrated that 92 yard drive against the Pittsburgh Steelers that has put these Ravens in position to be the number one seed when the Ravens knocked off the speeders twice the season in the pocket dumps it off the highway let's take a look at the San Diego Defense University of Western Ontario external grade Raleigh high school choral easy Illinois Shawn Phillips Purdue Washington Takeo Spikes Albert Travis the board Texas Steve Gregory Syracuse the Utah parent takes the University of Arizona get burned that was the number one defense in the league last year help Ron Rivera get the head coaching job at Carolina Husky takes over this season third and 12 from the 40 and Flacco protected it's Holden who takes the ball inside the 32 the car presents in the pockets Flacco hanging right in there they shoots one over the middle for a gain of 34 just come in with that bunch formation but really the protection key Joe Flacco able to step up in the pocket and this has really been one of the major issues in my estimation we're so used to so many of the great pass rushers coming through San Diego and guys with ability to get pressure but right now this Chargers secondary has been under so much pressure simply because they can't get that same kind of fat picked up in the past in complete a little underthrown casein is there in the leeevans who's been on the shelf injured a good part of the season former Buffalo Billy intended receiver okay sign a little bit late getting his head around Lee Evans of course the guy they're hoping is going to help break it out but if caisson gets his head around maybe a fraction early there might have come up with a big interception so it's second down and ten when the four games that he missed or Turner the head coach second on 10 from the the cash is knocked away at the last minute by Eric Weddle whose time for the league lead and interceptions was seven that was intended for evidence when'll got paid big this offseason and this time it pays off right here a lastsecond dive he is tied for the lead in interceptions and just enough on that one to save a big touchdown Whittle from Southern California has about a hundred friends and relatives at every game fortunately they have some money because most of them have their own season tickets George the defense's head some 1/3 down this season Flacco dumps it off to rights again white in the middle of the action to stop at the 19yard line and bring on the field goal to you well if you watch the Ravens very much at all you know that when all else fails it is going to be Ray Rice and despite the fact that was a very simple little dump off boy that he almost picked up the first down Billy Cundiff had a sore left cap and there was some question as to whether he'd be able to kick tonight but here he is this will be a 36yard attempt Thunder Scratchy joining us to the right is Andy no charges will take over first Peter Sunday Night Football you by Southwest Airlines you can you by Southwest Airlines you can find our fares online only at southwest.com Pizza sponsor of Super Bowl 46 by Zales to diamond store and by Nissan innovation for today innovation for tomorrow innovation for all this past week in Baltimore Ravens atma community distributing food and gifts for the holiday season for a Lewis back in the lineup missing a month after the initial fund Ofili goeth in a 26 yard line for the breweries and the charger offense goes to work and rivers they would have dumped it off and dumps it off to Ryan Matthews after the 40 Fresno State McLain came through in the middle and decked rivers gain of 13 yards Phillip on the season and that highlight is figure right there is the problem 17 interceptions a lot of them came in that sixgame losing streak instead of saying das do that he said you know what those 16 start like one long ugly game who was indeed and of course a lot of things happen remember the fumble against Kansas City a lot of strange ways of these football games that they are what they are knowledge no excuses two of them down over time only one to the outside and falling down is Jackson as we take a look at the San Diego starters Phillip Rivers NC State Brian Matthews presence a convincing Jackson Northern Colorado Malcom Floyd Wyoming your choice Central High School marina big Michael Jordan Jerry Davis Maryland go Terps tyro agree Nick Hardwick Purdue Luis Vasquez Texas pick Jeremy Clary Kansas State University that offensive line banged up all she's wrong mixing and matching fairly healthy though tonight eleven differ pushy Shelby gear 11 different starters on that offensive line this year's North Kearney said the other day we have on our backups backups playing and they're gonna get fresher right off the edge their allies that's a it one thing that the Baltimore Ravens are gonna try and do tonight is stop san diego's running game with just seven guys they want to be very protective on the back end allow these great receivers to make these big plays down the field so they're hoping they can stop the run with just seven up front third down a matchup the Ravens great at getting off the field best in the league and the Chargers were third best with converting the Chargers who in the first third battle of the night as McMichael Randy McMichael makes the catch so spot the ball at the 51st on San Diego nice job by Philip Rivers that time a loading nod it was going to come right at him right here it's running right for his nose and he stood in there and made a very difficult delivery pickup a big first down L Suggs on the outside getting a lot of attention and Randy McMichael able to get a piece of him and still pick up the first down we put a fullback in that's history that fuses the tailback Injection injection was looking to cry and Paxton images man Jackson bishop the Ravens sideline by Jimmy Smith well Norv Turner I can leave anything in the bag here tonight they go motion across the way to help protect on trial Suggs and run away from them that is the hardest thing in the world to do right there out is you're a wide receiver to not throw that ball and difficult tried to get it deployed down the field but guess who was right there ed Reed there working against thrill Suggs trying to stay away from him and boy has he been happy that would have been Jackson's first four we're finished second one in the middle in losing the ball but the Chargers wind up recovering it is Ryan Matthews and that has been the issue with him the Ravens are indicating they have it Gator the former Raven is saying I'm wearing a different uniform no and that's that's the fifth bundle of the year for Matthews and that was the issue with him last year in his rookie season there's no question about it Matthews has had three straight hundred yard rushing days he is a guy that they have huge expectations for but no running back in the league bumbles a higher percentage of his balls then does Brian Matthews you can see why the ball gets away from his body and it's easy to knock it out Terry William McNutt could have forced it and then Gaither who's a witch story playing left tackle leads in his paw and this is Jackson by the rookie Jimmy Smith and let's take a look at that raven defense James Cody album boy reading University of Texas Garrett Johnson Alabama Ray Lewis universal mind Jenelle McLain stearic use University says ball so hard University Jimmy Smith cool night school Bernard Pollard V Boilermakers the UK Williams Washburn then you go to Boston hard University Arizona's you're wondering Ravens not allowing an opponent to score the first drive of 21 straight games so you go back last year through October and this is brought on the outside and then McMichael would have been taken down for about a fiveyard loss and four seats to get back to the line of scrimmage really like what San Diego is doing so far they're anticipating the rush and the pressure that of course Baltimore applies on a every single game and so all they're doing is they're acting like they're chipping these outside pass rushers and then sort of turning around and taking screen passes or flare passes just a way to slow these guys second down and ten Matthews out to the white for the and throws it underneath it's brought there by Freud and now the son of a first down and gold we talked about the fact with Webb missing and the show mentioned at the top that your turn er said the one guy they would go to work on this Smith and that's what they're doing yeah and they're using motion that time they moved the back out of the backfield and by doing that they saw Ray Lewis move with him so he knew it was man coverage came with the pick route underneath it which is the perfect play for man coverage that's Norv Turner and his best buy motion by shifting he knows exactly what the defense is doing five of six in this opening drive we'll be out of bounds second and goal well for Philip Rivers he has had plenty of issues in the red zone this year throwing interceptions and not making plays that he typically does you think back to this offense in the past and of course Darren Sproles was such a big part of it Antonio Gates catches so many touchdowns Gates was early earlier in the year hurts so much of the time so now that he's starting to get Matthews involved they starting to understand what he's doing they're getting better down second dose from the truth gonna take a timeout five and a half to go opening frame those stories San Diego in some measure that speaks for the problems that rivers has had and the charges have had with mistakes three red zone interceptions this year yet for his first seven seasons second down and is there short yardage guy and he takes the ball just inside the 20yard line let's a Ray Lewis stuff that once I wrote a dream coming around the corner right here is Ray Lewis comes right up here and just takes on the offensive linemen and buries them excuse me that was Jamil mcclain who's been filling in for Ray Rice who made that play letting things out triangle he goes in me Green and my clover takes it into the end if San Diego to leave coming down with a doubleteam and pulling around they do a job on Ray Lewis inside and able to get Tolbert crews say that is huge the missed field goal for the Baltimore Ravens take it the length of the field the other way the San Diego Chargers continue to roll in December lock Lewis out of the play Nick Novak bobberts also a great special teams tender a lot of times the cherries were to touch that an amazing attack though on the kickoff will watch when we come back seven of it you're lucky to check it out NBC sports.com /sn eps extra to enhance your enjoyment of the game one of great feature of the logon vii oh nothing the San Diego Chargers been a perfect day for this team so far Denver loses Oakland loses at the end and they were showing that on the board here take a seven to nothing this is a Bukowski they won back the kickoff and he gets taken down off at the by jacob hester then the ball comes out you got a helmets flying off from the rookie Andrew GATS car and get things in order here cause tempers is the referee and it's the first action he's had to take care of tonight Ray Rice the offense runs through him in Baltimore leading the league in yards from scrimmage coming into the weekend he's being more than a third of the Ravens yards from scrimmage since all nine second highest to Chris Johnson of Tennessee and needs to the last 25 games he's been their leading rusher so that's more than a season and a half and rice on the referees down at 7:00 and more here tackled by the safety speed Gregory and it would be second down and three for the Ravens and it was really that week nine lost the Seattle that seemed to change things for this Ravens offense and that one Ray Rice had five carries for 27 yards and there was an outcry that he wasn't getting the ball enough and now when you talk to these guys they said believe me Ray Rice is gonna touch it at least 25 times in every game and maybe a reception and maybe a but this guy is rice will cut it back / left guard and comes close to picking up the first down Donald Butler makes the tackle and they do signal first down Baltimore these own schemes so many times it comes down to where are these interior lineman and then when does Ray Rice cut it back it's taken him a long time actually Vontae leach came over as the fullback for this team and he's been teaching Ray Rice a lot about those sort of so he was and if anything rice was cutting him back too or the season now he's pressing a little more that's worth invited than a nice job along that defensive front number 92 to make the stop charges lost at least Casteel on opening day so they've had to mix and match the one that defensive front as well as the offensive line yeah Vaughn Martin right in here and this young man has come off the bench he was a reserve and he's played more snaps than any other defensive lineman for the Chargers this year a very pleasant surprise for them second and ten Redman SP is the defensive coordinator was at San Francisco brought to Teo spunks the linebacker with him as well and Travis will boy second down and ten like Dennis Pitta they'd love to go to the Titans the Ravens beat addiction and pitiable they big part of that passing offense well and what you do is you take these big receiving tight ends we're seeing it around the league right now flank them out wide at for Steve Gregory the safety to come over and essentially play like a corner in a lot of space and when you get that big body it is almost impossible to try and break up a throw like that it is without question been the year the tight end and the NFL in fact they have three of them in the game right now and twenty Chris Wilson is the man and all across the 50yard line to the 49 ways tackled by Takeo Spikes yeah Marshall yonder is a guy that is just a nasty guard on the backside we have seen it since day one some of these cutbacks over here watch what they do here and alignment next to them and I mean those are just blocks that offensive linemen love and defensive linemen hate but that is a legal block because it's an adjacent line this time Ricky 11th year Heisman Trophy winner left football for a while he's gonna become a massage therapist and back he comes areas and he's closing in on ten thousand yards third most among active players yeah and Ricky waves what is the 34 years old now and still turning it up and you know he looks good running the football he runs with power he runs with authority and he's been a nice changeup for Ray Rice and back on Hill at the Patrick Henry high school here in San Diego for the 41 and then Flacco under pressure he has to throw it away nobody was she's Phillipston will be sickened down in 10 and it's been such a luxury to have Shaun Phillips back in the lineup he is the one real difference maker on this Chargers team missed a lot of time so far this season with injuries and we saw Minh a very similar play in the game last week not being fooled by a bootleg and Steve Gregory was the beneficiary of it ended up with an interception return for a touchdown Louis on the Ravens tribe won and his team down laya touchstone final minute opening quarter second down and ten intended Kotori spent the working is good to catch we third down and ten that was one weirdlooking throw I'm not sure exactly what happened if Flacco maybe thought he was in danger and saw it late who tried to regrip it but that baby sailed about ten it just like slipped out of his hand third and ten to fourman rush blaka escaping wanna pick up the first down and jammer so Flacco avoids the sack takes off to his right converts on third down on what figures to be the final play of the opening quarter Joe Flacco is as mobile as any quarterback playing in the game right now on some plays like that he has simply been tremendous making big plays for the ravens takes it to the 29 that's where the second quarter begins into one the San Diego Chargers seven the Baltimore Ravens Sunday night football resumed Zach aerial coverage tonight is being brought to you by Geico you look at downtown San Diego for Noah Island home of the Chargers since 1961 after they came into the American Football League is the Los Angeles chargers in 1960 Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya here in San Diego first intent for the Ravens would throw 7 nothing from the 29 yard we start the second quarter Ray Rice burst out of the 17 tackled by jammer Vontae leach just does not get enough credit for what he does watch him take out the outside linebacker here and just create a massive hole so you talked to cam Cameron he says this guy belongs in the Hall of Fame I like Hall of Fame he said absolutely he has been around some good fullbacks in the past but this is a guy that has made a difference for the Ravens and counter the offensive coordinator to Miami for years he had coached and then on to Baltimore rice picks up the York maybe two it'll be second down and eight and there is cam he was here in the Marty Schottenheimer he gets the Miami job Wade Phillips was running the defense he gets the Dallas job and then Marty gets fired and for a 14 and 2 season and of course the loss to the New England Patriots which still is in the throat of every charger fan there's no question I think North Turner's gonna have to finish this season store his job as well as with the who knows flicker down any trying to get the tonight at 7:00 that pressures too high it kicks in and you had Shawn Phillips the linebacker on the coverage third and eight upcoming well not really known as blockers these tight ends but Dennis Pitta number 88 watch him staying on Antoine Barnes on the outside and that's what allowed Joe Flacco to take shot down the a the middle and it is addiction for a touchdown diversion again the Chargers have so much trouble getting off the field on third down get burned again here 13 play 75 yards and an extra point away from a tie game yeah working against the Kia spikes who is really not practiced at all this week because of a bad back Steve Gregory was right there in position but as we've seen throughout the course of the season these big tight ends you throw it high let them go out and make a play and the safeties just can't get there well they've done this will miss the 36 yard field goal to keep an eye on him with a sore left camp is automatic that's the point is good in a minute and a half into the second quarter we're not in San Diego Raven seven Chargers seven on Sunday Night Football all right tomorrow night the NBC hit show fear factors anything catch it tomorrow night at 8:00 eastern Pacific 7:00 central and now right here on NBC the ballpark here oxygen on the sideline head readin is defense ready to come back at richard mujinju attorney that is pundit who is able to send that one to the back of the end zone and Berbers and the Chargers would begin their second possession of the night at the chargers another bizarre season normally they start very slowly but this year they start fast they went four out of five then the roof caves in lose the next six there's a bye week in there as well they went almost two calendar months without a win then they win the last two games Oh be it it's Jacksonville and Buffalo that knocked off by a combined 75 to 24 here they are right back in the race with losses today by the Broncos and the Raiders we have seen teams get hot late and have those runs carry right through into the playoffs last six seeds have won the Super Bowl in the last home year Matthews picks up to go back and look at some of the things Norv Turner is doing using motion to his advantage by taking Matthews and flanking the amount Ray Lewis had to go with him at that point Philip Rivers now knows he has man coverage so he's gonna go with the PICC route use gates on one side force Jimmy Smith to run over the top hit it in there to mount employed that's what Norv Turner does about as well as anybody in football he can help his quarterback figure out exactly what they're playing and what they're doing on the other side and that's an Tonio gay the first down so Chris perhaps you heard Kansas City beat Green Bay today and how about the the division race though in the AFC West where every team is still alive including Kansas City yeah and you have to give Romeo Crennel a lot of credit where they didn't blink at all in that game we saw their defense play so well earlier in the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers so who knows but I tell you when you watch Philip Rivers start to play and throw the ball the way he is right now it's hard not to like what the San Diego Chargers are doing to and this is why and I really think you could almost take Ryan Matthews rushing yards at the end of this game and I can tell you whether San Diego is going to win or not so much of this offense is built around play action and unfortunately in order to have success you have to beat guys like Hello de nada inside now he can just physically take your guy and move him backwards and all of a sudden it's a lot tougher to try and run the football second down and nine fortyfive is going to get buried back at the 25yard line and there's a penalty while scheffers has not had to make any calls tonight here's Corey reading this would be the first penalty of the game personal foul head slapped number 55 defense big penalty on terrell suggs having the kind of year he could be the Defensive Player of the Year in the NFL yeah but this one hurts you go from sack to 15 yards the other way and boy Randy McMichael had no chance and Ryan Matthews trying to clean him up you saw that but inside inside it was a pretty dominant rush that time by Jamil McClain who distracted Luis Vasquez just enough to set up the sack it great for the charges the more is it the mid Felix strike poor ereading it is there to make the tackle it will be second down and nine Randy McMichael right now has a big assignment animal as we speak he's getting beat up on the outside by Suggs he's turning his head he's looking a little nervous he has got a plow his way in there he's not a huge guy sucks as a much more physical guy but you can see right now McMichael is flinching just a bit on those hits and he is a key blocker tonight in this game both teams totally balanced run pass to this point pressure coming rivers kitchen away Julio's gates who makes the catch and gazes mouth for two and he's two away from tying Charlie Joyner as the alltime San Diego charger reception leader that's a 20yard game it again north turner using motion this time they moved to a zone gave rivers a good look and Antonio Gates who is getting healthier this guy has had a bad fourth the entire year has not been able to practice much practice the entire week and right now they're thinking that he could be a major factor in this way and there's Charlie joiner assistant coach with the Chargers who leads gates now by two of all time the legendary to a man the Raymond's bring the rivers have superstores they've got Ray Lewis and hello Dean lava and they've got a dream but they will tell you this guy is right there with everybody on this defense Jarrett Johnson just doesn't get the pub and what he does better than anybody is stuff anybody who wants to try and knock him out Antonio Gates had no prayer that time when you talk to some of these coaches about Jared Johnson they say when other coaches approached them before the game one of the first names they bring up is Garrett Johnson they'd haven't seen a sand backer set the edge not allowed guys outside any better in the league than what he does the injection laser for containers Winston Jackson had gotten the step with the pan saloon just can't miss this you're going to get cover zero back here no free safety whatsoever it's going to be a free shot no pressure on Phillip Rivers and that's one they'd have to hit they want to go against Jimmy Smith the young wookie brilliant route missed the throw stick that one in your back pocket if the Chargers don't come up with a win tonight that was a huge opportunity and Jackson knows it the Tigers takes a crack from Lewis and the Chargers to Center for a field goal one of the reasons you don't cut back is you don't want to see this when you're whoa and remember helmettohelmet is off when it's a runner in the open field not that defenseless player welcome back Ray Lewis 45yard attempt for Nick Novak he had to take over the second week of the season they launched their Pro Bowl kicker Nate Kaeding the first play of the season on opening day go back his San Diego go in the opening half well tomorrow the quiz show that has been a huge hit in Europe coming to America who's still standing is the Shoah premiers tomorrow night right here on and who's still standing in the AFC West everybody amazing in the past well his fingertips and seven San Diego Jocasta one back from the two yard line 25 yard line he goes in the half San Diego on top ten to seven over the razors John Harbaugh was years in Philadelphia neither preceded him very big on the military's made a trip to Afghanistan with other coaches a couple of years ago and the Ravens decided as an organization to send Christmas gifts to the Troops 800 boxes is our honest Stan and Jon yesterday said she brought the team out on the Ravens go down and visit the Navy's fields here in San Diego Ricky Williams Starr says the running picks it up one where he was and he's been on a couple those USO trips and the one remember more than any other was Jeff Fisher there's one of the coaches that went along finally found a way to escape and go fish caught a fourfoot fish and to think bit him in the face so this is but for the so many of the we're in women alone here in San Diego big charges for to swing it out to the by Eric Weddle third down and four after a pickup of one here the old Harvard die in the middle the center Matt Burke still finds a way to get it going here I did you've seen have some great days the past we're talking a campaign like they have the best center in the division balancing company there's some pretty good ones in these now let's see third down and this is where the Chargers had trouble all season long had trouble on the way drive touchdown was poured on the third down play it's 35 in a fourman rush Wakko escapes again to be the class damnit scam Thomas who for the moment we'll get the shack pending the flag start number 78 well so that was whistled dead and the crowd was so alive that nobody heard that McKinney at the fall story you know one of the things that Brian McKinney still has a tough time with is any kind of a speed washer on the outside Ravens have basically eliminated seven step drops because they feel like as with that baggage with speedy running game to third and ten briefing up corner blitz coming fast on the outside is bought for a first that Torrey Smith makes his first catch of the night rookie out of Maryland who broke in with a spectacular rumors against st. Louis his first three receptions this season their four touchdowns the Blitz over here off the lefthand side and nicely picked up had time by the back and Torrey Smith that's a tough catch on the outside going to the ground you bobble that one at all which he did a little bit but I think made a clean catch Ray Rice now back in of another third division and in the third and ten filled by Takeo Spikes and we check in with Michelle Chargers linebacker Travis Laboy has gone to the locker room he is questionable with a knee injury so Antoine Barnes in we'll let you know if anything changes but right now questionable with aniele Barnes a former raven played three years they're leading soccer on the team now and really not that huge of an injury because Antoine Barnes and Travis Laboy usually alternated anyway now that Shawn Phillips will bat second down and eight 11 and the charges come across the line who did what to whom encroachment number 71 defense fiveyard penalty remains second down to race first across that'll make it second down and six we would be willing to circle that but I think everybody saw that Paul sighs that was not that big a deal Chargers no they have a great opportunity tonight though boy and not often when you're struggling through the course of a season do you catch a day like the day when everybody in front of you loses they know what this opportunity means tonight the top of that show is life steps of a third down in about three that the only team in the history of the NFL to have a sixgame losing streak at any point the season and get to the playoffs would be the 1976 90 Bengals and what was amazing is that was in a 14 game season here's John Philip Sousa to make a difference for this team despite the fact he got double release able to find yeah they throw it has a little too high for Ray with a stop and this will be the first punt of the game my what a blown opportunity we saw the Chargers have won this is a layup this is Kobe Bryant missing a layup out here we've got a pick action coming in here Ray Rice by himself in the flat for a walk in first down and they can't get it completed Jason in the opening half with Sandy Baltimore 10 December one of the solid and steady guys in the middle Nick Hardwick the center and a big weekend for him because yesterday his wife presented him with Hudson Harold Hardwick born last night just before seven o'clock the couple's first child congratulations to the hard way 40yard line on first down the middle goes ym he talked about Nick Hardwick and certainly congratulations to their family but what remarkable story a guy that never played high school football he was a wrestler throughout high school wrestled at a hundred and 71 pounds walked on after his sophomore year in college was hoping maybe to play on the punt team someday and now as a Pro Bowler in the National Football League that 171 pounds is now up around 300 pounds and he's been so vital into you when they lost Marcus but nearly early was a couple of Pro Bowl guys along the left side of the line eleven different starters on the offensive line juggling and outofbounds is not complied along the sideline right in front of the Raven coaching staff Jimmy Smith covering 3rd and 8th for Jimmy Smith he's seeing a lot of action tonight or Turner really feeling like that this young corner was confident to the point maybe a little overconfident he said this guy hasn't experienced in the National Football League yet they can kind of scare you they thought they might be able to get deep on him first round pick out of and hang with the big guys is 6 2 includes in himself burden aid get away by Vincent Jackson and catching gets pushed down from behind at the 20yard Henry Williams able to chase him down and knock him down 58 if you're gonna go with the double move on the outside you have to be able to pick up the Blitz on the inside here they come nice job on the outside by Jared Gaither picking up the linebacker allows enough time for this double move to happen there you go there's the Chargers twominute warning they tie the halftime show the Patriots beat the Broncos in Denver another big day for true breeze what else is though Bob will talk about the Packers going into Kansas City and losing for the first time this season now with two minutes to go rivers throw ease we fear of pollard covering second down on the long play it was Jared Gaither the tackle that they picked up from the Kansas City Chiefs he played one play for the chief jumped offsides they cut him but he has made a huge difference here that time getting Ray Lewis and giving Phillip Rivers just enough time remarkable that he's been able to come over here and have the impact that he had had nothing at left tackle he didn't know what they were going to do when Gaither has just been in beautiful the guard Tyrone green over there and he wasn't too thrilled about that rivers 2nd down and 10 from the 20 these days inbound some of these first down and goal at the north earner is really getting them with these motions it's allowing rivers to know exactly what's going on and this one when the motion comes out this way you're going to see Brendon Ayanbadejo go with him the linebacker rivers right now knows it's man coverage he goes to his man coverage corner route and hits Malcom Floyd down the field this has really been a masterful game plan to date against a very good defense in Baltimore was again Chargers have two timeouts left and they're not thinking about that right now they're thinking about taking as much time off the clock and getting into the end zone obviously watch ray lewis come across their stop right in the hole right in his tracks and Tolbert is a huge man locked out of 40 seconds they want to leave nothing at all for the Ravens on the other side Chargers three drives tonight touchdowns field goals is the third drive we'll see what the end result is squash back to the outside map the charges taken sits down the officials look at each other and then they do signal it easy Aulani goes it'll be reviewed upstairs for the moment it's a touchdown seven play drives a big pass of course was the 58 yard interjection and I just told you how hard it is to get outside Jared Johnson it was but the key block was Antonio Gates on the outside what a matchup that is and Reid flanks out there wide so the Chargers take advantage of the size differential and allow gates to block on Reed just enough to get it in there that's Duncan for the extra point and that's good so that worked out perfectly for the Chargers as they took a little bit nineteen seconds and San Diego already with two big presents today then for losing Oakland losing and they're up by ten against the Ravens Sunday night football from San Diego being brought to you by Verizon your holiday smartphone destination it never needs a battery unstoppable and my old Navy come fun come all old maybe the USS Midway the retired aircraft carrier Nellie Museum here in San Diego fans third in the league will be our diesel a third and points allow giving up 17 on 19 seconds remain the charges three projections and all fruitful tonight the two touchdowns and a field goal and San Diego will get the opening kickoff of the second half as well because they deferred after winning the open and coin toss you know really the strength of the Ravens defense is that front seven and their ability to stop you from running the football so what Noah Turner's done tonight said basically right we're gonna do that a little bit so we're gonna open this thing up we're gonna go empty backfield we're gonna take our backs out wide and force them to adjust and so far the charges event ahead a nightmare get it deep enough to set up at the two seconds left and timeout is taken here so time for one play barring a defensive foul here and you can see how the Chargers are gonna line up defensively cover 12 Nega San Diego taking the time out you know it's so significant though for the Baltimore Ravens we talked about they're still battling with Pittsburgh who plays San Francisco tomorrow night in this game and there is a huge difference that between minor Provo balloting you can go to rediff.com send your favorite guys to back in Hawaii working now toriel convoy Aloha Aloha and a bottle to you that flacco spinning away spinning around the sack of the 37 having everything breaking their way today and try to take advantage of it look at the second half Hitler 177 Diego welcome to the Toyota halftime show brought to you by Toyota moving forward intent on capitalizing on losses by the Broncos and Raiders the Chargers lead by 10 at the half as we go cross country to Dan Patrick all right Bob with Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison thoughts on the first half well I'm glad North Turner was watching us on the pregame show when we said throw the ball deep to Vincent Jackson Baltimore's got to find a way to put some pressure on rivers and the charges must continue to spread the Ravens defense out and forced him to cover these six four and six five weapons across the field by the way I'll pat you on the back because that's what you want North listen to him let's get to the week 15 highlights a couple of surprises on the afternoon the marquee game Patriots at the Broncos Tim Tebow got the Broncos on the board first of his two touchdowns but the day belong to Tom not Tim Chad Ochocinco on the receiving end of this Brady Fassett threw for 322 scores Patriots clinched the AFC East Jets Eagles Eagles keep their division hopes alive against the Jets Michael Vick a touchdown through the air and this is first rushing touchdown of the season Redskins Giants tough day for Eli Manning no touchdown passes three picks Giants still in the East if they win their final to Lions Raiders down six under two minutes ago 98 yard drive Matthews got a state deep on him Matthew Stafford to Calvin Johnson and then Stafford to Johnson Stafford fifth career for touchdown game Lions approved at nine and five Saints in the Vikings Drew Brees leads 305 yards over the final two games to break Dan Marino's singleseason record he threw for five touchdowns no picks for 212 yards Packers Chiefs shock of the day sheep sin to the Packers pursuit of perfection Tomba Holly and the KC defense manhandled Green Bay three sacks for Holly pick up the victory more than just a loss for the Packers Tony well I think it was we were ready to concede the Lombardi Trophy to these these guys and I think Romeo Crennel and time of Holly gave us the blueprint how to get after him rush the passer and now with these injuries to the offensive line I know Mike McCarthy has to be worried and if he's not worried Aaron Rodgers should be worried yeah you got bearspackers coming up next Sunday night here on NBC what about you the Patriots secondary much improve didn't blow any coverages no miscommunications big balls over there big throw balls over their head much improved in Wheatley they were gonna get Tim Tebow it's a starting point it's not that we couldn't get any worse but it got better Samantha when we come back Bob Costas on the Packers losing the Colts winning but before that time to announce the winner of Toyotas halftime handoff between 12 summer on the networks of NBC Universal back in San Diego so for yet another year the 72 dolphins are safe they remain the only perfect singleseason team in NFL history this of course because the Packers a huge favor to Kansas City couldn't make it to 14 and OH at roughly the same time the Indianapolis Colts who were 14 and OH two seasons that now seem like an eternity ago avoided oh and 14 by notching a win against Tennessee so the Packers will not match the o7 Pats at 16 and oh and the Colts will not match the oh eight Lions at Owens 16 beyond these statistical coincidences the Colts and Packers are perhaps linked in a more significant way with two weeks to go Indy still has the worst record in the league and unless they have the poor judgments to conclude the season with a mini winning streak they can still claim the number one pick of the draft the question is what to do with it if they get it and for the answer they might look to Green Bay where Aaron Rodgers sat for three full seasons behind Brett Favre before emerging as one of the league's best what's wrong with that scenario for Indy Peyton Manning will be 36 by next season even if you were completely healthy the Colts would need a plan of succession it's extremely unlikely but over the next few years they'd have another shot at anyone nearly as good as Stanford's Andrew Luck is expected to be so take him and let him back up Manning that's no hardship that's an honor plus if Manning should go down again the Colts would be left with a viable option unlike this year when they went from a playoff team to utter ineptitude when Manning hit the sideline yeah we know there are contract issues here but creative organizations can figure their way around that it's also true that other key Colts are aging even so when Manning returns they can be a decent team again and at the same time they could have a quarterback in waiting who might someday do for them what Rodgers is doing the Packers now tomorrow morning on today an interview with Bill O'Reilly and also actress Rooney Mara on her new film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Mara is NFL royalty a direct descendant of two prominent NFL families the Mehra's of the Giants and the Rudi's of the Steelers back

service provider of the National Football League now Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya on this middecember Sunday night in San Diego Chargers wrapping up their home schedule two games to play at Detroit next Saturday Christmas Eve and then at Oakland Ravens 18th Street rolled losses trailing at the half second warriors free hit not the company you want to keep when the Rams are there in your second but it could be we'll go out of bounds but after it crossed the goal line so a good break there because pontiff is able to save 20 yards go back and look at some of the things that the Chargers are doing offensively when the motion comes out you see them just take the defensive back and move him out but in this case now zone when they emotional Joe is in man coverage on the outside so that's when they'd like to back inside to their man route out to the corner if Malcolm Floyd on the big play and so far this little motion game plan has been worked to perfection started Mike over to the back deal if he stays in the ball and then it's caught on the outside but incomplete incomplete McMichael gets popped and we checked with Michelle I spoke with John Harbaugh at halftime and he said they've got to get pressure on Philip Rivers and he also said and I quote the officials have got to call holding once in a while and if they don't we're not gonna be able to get anywhere but North Turner said the key to protecting Rivers has been changing things up on the offensive line using different personnel groupings and he said we're just simply blocking better two interesting perspectives Michelle one guy thinks there should be penalties being cold the other says we're blocking better but it's that offensive line of San Diego that battered and bruised and mixed and matched wine is doing very good job than I after the 23 yard line whether it be inpatient they're trying to stay with this running game but inevitably it is going to be Philip Rivers that has to win this thing there just hasn't been anybody really this season able to consistently line up and bang it in there and pick up first downs running the football so Philip Rivers who has been hot lately seven touchdowns no interceptions in the last three games and here's another big third down against the best third down defense there is faso 424 rushing yards at 170 passing yards for the Chargers who gets it away caught up at the 39yard sort of read and fairy move the change well one of the problems with bringing pressure the way that they are and they're bringing everybody here is you have to play single coverage on the back ends and so far Philip Rivers has been able to get it out before Ray Lewis can get there and this oneonone coverage with these big wide receivers one of the things the Ravens had hoped to do was take their bigger taller quarterbacks and match up against those guys but so far it's been Malcolm Floyd and Vincent Jackson winning the battle boy took a shine has taken on for the moment ventually brownie rookie out of sandy takes a ball crossed before the yard line gain of a couple second entities everybody understands what's at stake here Gaither knows plenty of guys on the other side having been a Baltimore Raven even though one of the guys he's pushing and shoving was wasn't there when he was there Pollak second and seven just outside the 40yard line that is juggle the hill on truth by Vincent grounds a third round draft choice to plan his college football in this very Stadium oh really it was a nice job bag McMichael getting a little chip on the Blitzer outside and then Brown who is a guy that had to pick up a little bit of the roll this year but you see McMichael getting just enough of Suggs who has really not been much of a factor so far in this ball game he is a guy that had three sack palm ties a week ago was a game wrecker in that one and really has not got to go on here tonight to the outside the states except the first down by Ellerbe it's 18 yards to the Baltimore 28 here's the battle going on right here Randy McMichael setting down inside and really that was supposed to be a gap filled by the wide receiver Malcolm Floyd that time came and made the big crack back block and Matthew is able to bounce it outside of doing that effort at a cannot free a couple of plays after taking his shot and interception secondhand Matthews stop by reading it the court Webster who doesn't get a lot of credit I mean Cory reading it doesn't get a lot of credit inside occasionally is one of those guys kind of like a Jarret Johnson is what really makes this defense go these big defensive linemen inside they protect Ray Lewis they don't let offensive linemen get down on their linebackers which is what allows Lewis and reel McClain and some of those guys that go sidelines sideline goes off a little slowly Tolbert is in the backfield in rivers that's pregnant coming to the inside second down and ten 28 yards stays inbounds and the Chargers open the second half with an 80 yard eight play touchdown drive against Jimmy Smith number 22 they said he was a little jumpy for a Wookiee a little overconfident they were going to try and take advantage of it and motion down inside so they switch so they end up being able to run that one on Jimmy Smith and for having a big for the confirmation so he's holding of the extra point he gets it now touchdown is good Novak to the extra point and the San Diego Chargers have now score every drive tonight that makes it a 17point game and I'll say who's enjoying this right now is sitting at a hotel in San Francisco but this burg Steelers play the 49ers tomorrow night 247 San Diego Sunday Night Football next week it's the only game on Sunday night as Chicago takes on Green Bay's only game on Sunday period because all the rest of the teams except Atlanta and New Orleans that play on Monday night will be in action on Saturday so Christmas night pull up a chair get down in the end zone so the Ravens would have the ball for the first time in the third quarter down by 17 points in San Diego three weeks ago the fan base here going crazy want AJ Smith the general manager fired they want more turn of the coach fired so here you are three weeks later you beat Jackson will you beat Buffalo you get Denver to lose you at Oakland to lose your leading Baltimore by 17 different game first down that's Cory Smith making the catch but that's not the sacred that either or both guys keep their job unless of course they have a miracle run and go all the way to Indianapolis you know it's just hard to watch San Diego play like this because you feel like this is the way they should have been playing all along there were some significant factors though in this whole thing so many injuries that offensive line to blowers on the left side so they're not without excuses the Ravens to try to change the Matis quarks were first down by addiction meanwhile the AFC playoff picture just to refresh here right now there your division leaders Pittsburgh and the Jets would hold the wild card spots at the moment but the important thing is here that the number one seed is still up for grabs Baltimore controls that but only if they win out and didn't need any other help well especially this year for Baltimore they have not been good on the for the average days and Flacco is going to go down and that is Tommy Harris sparingly playing here but the longtime Chicago beer stalwart there number of years ago who comes in to get the shack well one of the reasons they can't get the ball to Ray Rice's Antoine Barnes is hitting them before you can get out you know we always talk about backs chipping on outside pass rushers now they're chipping on the backs it's kind of the reverse of that that is exactly what their plan was in San Diego tonight they said any body other than Ray Rice touching the ball we're happy second down and 18 when the 34 the pocket is a very for gain Finnick gets taken down like dante use and it will be third down and 14 for the ravens you know this is this is the uncomfortable time obviously for the Ravens they think they're a much better passing team they have Torrey Smith down the field threat but now with this lead the Chargers they were played soft back there in the secondary and there's nothing to check down sirota that's it again look out and he's going to go down again and it launched again that's Antoine dollars the extra Raven team in sacks just recorded his eighth Barnes gonna be the beneficiary of some really good coverage down the field they tried to get the crossing route in there to Torrey Smith and nogo Bank Juan Bolden who's been very quiet tonight and no goalie Evans covered that ditch them inside taken away meanwhile you got a late flag because we're going on after the play facemask and so all of that for North it would have been four thousand twenty one and norms game why borns had his hand on it let go and Flacco's signaling to the official he had my face mask I didn't see the flag it didn't happen in the smoke afterwards right did not black in whoo territory by Donald Butler where it's really just amazing how this offense seems to jumpstart when they find a way to start drives and get the ball in ray Rice's hands Joe Flacco kind of gets upset whenever you're talking about you know oh you know the games that we've lost is you know we haven't gotten the ball to Ray Rice and I said when we got behind you know we got to spread it out you got to go no huddle you got to hurry it up but I think the point that should be made from the critics standpoint is that's fine but make sure Ray Rice still gets his touches second in injuries Williams in the backfield next to Flacco in the door decades ago has he first down 36 yard line the one guy that's made an impression on me tonight is marshal yonder the right guard he is a guy that is not only big and strong and physical but really has sort of a nasty edge to him but also the ability to block to here he's going to come up and then get the second guy hit right there up on the linebacker level those kinds of blocks are what allows some big things to happen down the field send around the pattern incomplete because the camera couldn't hold on Quentin jammer headed right there off the deflection and couldn't make the pick second down and if you have a criticism of Quentin jammer during the course of his career it's just the inability to catch the ball in key situations not any easy catch by any means but here's a guy coverage wise more often than not gets it done but just has trouble in his hands around the ball he's such a great athlete you just expect to catch although you would think both here in the league firstround pick back in bow to a really good career but that is the Albatross second and ten this little picture to the 27 yard line Takeo Spikes strikes across the samer couldn't handle it and spikes his outfit care of it honestly don't know what flacco was watching on this play Spike's doesn't do anything unusual it's obvious Flacco never saw him for a second and after the interception and after the play was over bill legal demonstration on the intercepting team 15yard penalty so instead of at the 25 they go back to the 40 because of nonsense and Takeo Spikes is bound to determined to finally make a playoff isn't he this guy has played 200 games in the National Football League no games zero nada zilch in postseason the San Diego Chargers fans are starting to sound like the San Diego charger fans they've been waiting a long this season to see this team play this way Spike's Cincinnati and San Francisco he goes to Philadelphia one year what happens they don't make the playoffs 14 years in the league was at the 42 yard line parts of this game I believe is the fact that ladarius web one of the Ravens best cornerbacks is dressed for this one but really has not played very much and Jimmy Smith the young rookie who's a good player is going to be a good player but he has been the top target tonight they have found ways to go after him consistently and Webb just has not been a factor at all section two the 29 and another San Diego first down and rivers is 15 at 75% for 238 against the Baltimore Ravens well it doesn't look like much but Randy McMichael on the outside just gets a little piece of Suggs which is allowing Jeremy Clary just enough time to keep them off his quarterback and really when Suggs doesn't get home for this Ravens defense they have issues other than blitzing trying to get there this has sort of been a mass attack against 12 sides and it is worse sitting there game playing and you're thinking what we're gonna track that's exactly what they'd watch this all night long we have seen various ways that get after man really Randy McMichael has been one of the primary guys on the outside they motion him to his side sort of wherever he is it's not always a devastating block he gets in the way and then releases out into the pattern which buys those tackles a little time and that head slap right there took away the only sack the Ravens had tonight and there's a big turning point we're 20 to go is the courier the passage the outside but nothing and again they go to work on Jimmy Smith so the plan is we're going to attack Suggs on one hand and go after Jimmy Smith on the other and it's working for perfection the only winners Phillip Rivers with a great audible he sees and Reid leaning this way he gets oneonone coverage against the rookie on the other side no way he's not going there you could almost hear he couldn't get the words out of his mouth fast enough that audible edy Reed leans no problem there you go Jimmy Smith another one coming right at you first and goal Divac touchdown name you got a lamp every year towards the end of the year people will start to say hey what's the team you don't want to face in the playoffs sometimes it's a team that might not even get to the playoffs but the way San Diego's playing the night they'd be one of the things they sure are and we've talked about it a little bit wasn't a devastating block by Randy McMichael but let's give him credit here's a guy that has been in motion he's taken on the toughest blocking assignments throughout the course of the night and his ability to catch a pass occasionally forces those defenses to cover in two ways he's made a difference in this five possessions against the haunted Raven deepest 317 Sunday night football being brought to you by McDonald's I'm lovin it by BMW the ultimate driving machine by the HTC Rezound the only phone with builtin speech audio and by Bud Light the official beer sponsor of the NFL here we go Patrick Henry high school is where Ricky Williams went to school during a senior year in 94 San Diego high school player of the year they've had a few down here Marcus Allen grew up here Reggie Bush is it a couch me two yard line a chick less than four minutes to play in the third quarter and the Chargers they try to make a of a big January the second it'll be the Rangers against the Flyers it's the NHL Winter Classic at home NHL hockey there's Weiss on first down taking the Chargers doing something that hasn't been done since the Ravens came into the league as the Ravens in 1996 first team to score on the first five drives of any game and that would be 254 total regular season games for TDs and a field goal tonight and you can only get to the 27 yard line where he's taken down my reform work dekes you know this is the first time all season this Ravens defense has given up over 30 points 31 points down we're still in the third quarter you wondered coming into this when you go okay the Chargers offense is hot they scored 38 it's 37 points but what could they do against this Ravens defense defense at six rushing touchdowns all season intercepted it is confirmed intercepted at the 28 yard line Shawn Phillips let's see if he caught it good this was a National Hockey League it would be gold by Phillips and the assist of Barnes Phillips had it Barnes helped him secured and then Phillips winds up with the ball at the very end so he gets the interception charges have a First Avenue 27 yard line a 30round the shuttle so Rizzoli one of those cases where your offensive line block to well they're gonna have a stunt coming here but because they pick up Sean Phillips coming from outside in he's a veteran player realize the not getting to the quarterback get your hands up and now the juggling act starts and there's the assist there's the interception there's all the things you're talking about with Flacco has been picked on the last two possessions two turnovers of the game twentyseven Philip goes down and Suggs makes his acquaintance that was some shot there my terrell suggs coming back inside and he has a direct shot that philip rivers watch this one that's one you don't get up so fast and that's really what the Ravens have been missing tonight they haven't been able to get pressure on Robert and he didn't get up so fast they kind of bent over as we were showing you the replay taking an extra moment third down eight in the 27 yard line a lot of speculation around the country that Rivers was hurt earlier this year loser Duane Barry was throwing a lot of interceptions distant wolf right and Philip said absolutely untrue I appreciate people trying to make excuses for me it was never an issue ever and Suggs told us some said I listen we have lose effect for this guy we appreciate his toughness in there and Nick Novak second stint with the Chargers had to take over when Katie tore his ACL on the opening play of opening day 37 yarder and it hits the upright so if my old partner John Madden used to call a donk well you know sometimes funny things jumpstart you you catch a break you turn it over you don't give up any points so joe flacco gets another shot it went inside it just been going over the point back there's your drink do you think John came up with all those perfect words well you know you think about when you listen to that sound if you had a spell that sound that would be like do i NK point yeah it's pretty good wonder if John has a dictionary or anything you know that he's got the boom in the way doing the ducking and he's got the double cut wasn't that one he's got everything he had everything but the big ugly's ever speak Jackson he had the turducken timeout taken here you can't underestimate the importance of what's gonna happen in the AFC North especially the ball or Ravens they're in the position right now it could be the number one Street but if then not the number one seed they gonna wind up as the number five seed in all likelihood and you just wonder how this might impact Ben Roethlisberger's decision tomorrow night Nitori smith is able to with the Ravens help above the offensive lineman yonder keep possession of it well we know that the Baltimore Ravens understand I got a little TV timeout of that that's good he deserves it he's been playing well out here tonight they just needs a breakout play they need something they're down 24 that's conceivably two three touchdowns and screeching point conversions but they haven't that fast dangerous were winds up in the arms of Torrey Smith and that's a first down yeah I tell you Joe Flacco's been close on a lot of them now they can start chances defensively almost got there on another one but they really haven't taken a shot down the field because basically because of this lead now the Chargers sitting there with those two deep safeties down the field that that's the Ole Miss gonna take us to the end of the third quarter and San Diego or the Chargers lead the Ravens alerting seven and aerial coverage tonight being brought to you by Geico as you look at Belmont Park that's called the great dipper that roller coaster there was that's the Belmont Park without paramutual windows not a place that we'd necessarily frequent would you get on the great dipper and back we come into the stadium which was opened in 1967 it's second down and you know all of the charges somehow keeps controlling the ball but nothing but those powder blue shirts and their barns Ron Phillips and there's another sack well there was plenty of time on the play there's no question about it pocket sort of just squeezed closer like Eli Manning is that Super Bowl for Ovid that time another sack and for Joe Flacco you can tell he's getting frustrated with all these dump offs he wants to work the ball down the field they just can't the Chargers are playing 14 the charges it's for Saks tonight for the Chargers plus one that was negated by a penalty and none for the Ravens this has been some performance and I think the interesting part about this thing is that this banged up Chargers defense has played tremendous football tonight which great go out of bounds beautifully the oneyard line beautifully iego well this is a familiar refrain for charger Finch take a look at that since oh seven when North took over here 19 and two in December in January rivers 24 and 2 versus 1950 when December in January and again this year they've done such a hole for themselves normally they dig it early and then come out the rest of the way this year they actually got off to a good start at four in one and then had the sixgame losing streak now they're on the verge of making it a fourgame winning streak fashion breathing space taken pester fix it up to three good a flag yeah nice job by Philip Rivers going with the hard count off his own goal line really have nothing to lose if your guys jump first and five from out of the six now well and Suggs is thinking what I was thinking it's time for this defense to step up and make a play there are superstars on this Ravens defense and the superstars have done really nothing tonight ed Reed Ray Lewis trial Suggs bode nada you know this is the time they've got them backed up if you're gonna make a move this is now it's got to happen miss Lewis you could see grabbing Jacob mr. bringing him to the ground with some metal it's really been the story of this game there's no file for a face mask on the playa be second down to unofficial it looks like one when he got talked off of it well and you can put the hand and tackle the facemask if you don't grab it and twist it and turn it there's a either on that helmet and you could almost see Ray Lewis's hands sliding across the visor he couldn't have done a face mask if he wanted to go and get his hands in there turned out to be a good coal second down and one for the tag Matthew well this stadium has been around since 1967 is Jack Murphy Stadium for a while man Qualcomm bought the naming rights and then Qualcomm as a new product believe it or not called Snapdragon so for the next couple of weeks this stadium will actually be known there it is Snapdragon Stadium snapdragons one for one so far well last night I'm trying to think about Howard Cosell saying hello again everyone and welcome the Snapdragon stadium in San Diego California the end of civilization first down Matthew man that Bernard Pollard comes down he makes some hits that make you just sort of cringe watching him coming out of centerfield gets down there so fast to make this hit and when he hits you you stay hit he is one of those guys that just fits the mold you know there's some guys that just looked like Ravens players when they walk on the field when he is saintly when I'm not the cover guy ed Reed is but he's a hitter number one graduate for the 22yard line traded up to get Matthews damn you think about you know the recent history here obviously they had LT LaDainian Tomlinson and then they had Michael Turner and then had to make a choice a few years ago do you want to bring LT back or whatever with Turner's Turner winds up going to Atlanta guilty that goes to New York and they have to draft a new back and that's 999 yards for Matthews diffusion but here's the difference unlike LTE Ryan Matthews comes out on third down he's not the protection guy and he's not the receiver that helped however who was a Cary's 32 yards and that yards for Toby well one of the problems when you bring in your nickel and dime defense you don't have as many guys so here's Luis Vasquez coming around with a trap well there goes Mike Tolbert basically whatever Norv Turner is called tonight it has been good and rain Louis's first game back from injury has not been good well that's norms pedigree in a way it's offense he's always been extremely highly regarded as a play caller and tonight is born but that's the frustration among the charger things they go why can't this team looked like this all the time how do you go into Kansas City and look like that how do you blow a lead in New York to the Jets and look like that how do you lose to Denver in overtime you know how do you set up a 50 someodd yard field goal instead of working the ball down the field against Denver and that's why the fans are so frustrated well I understand that and I also understand that when you lose to Pro Bowlers on the offensive line and Marcus McNeil and Chris Dielman without question the great that has to be the most cohesive in the NFL is that offensive line and when you start mixing and matching inevitably often meanwhile here's Gaither former Raven left there who had lost the way wasn't in shade that a contract issue winds up in teens I said let's go back to a couple of weeks ago we are in Kansas City and Kansas City shouldn't have even been in this game and all of a sudden they give him the Steelers all I can handle they bring Gaither in because of an injury to the starter it Occulus his false start and that got Gaither in effect the trip to San Diego yeah he was cut and when you talk to Phillip Rivers he said this guy is the greatest waiver wire pickup ever I mean there's no question to plugging him in it has made a huge difference on this office luis and pick up the first down everything is working the powder blue I think that sort of says it all that's been the night tonight superstar players on this Ravens defense not playing like superstars Ray Lewis sorta has Tolbert dead to right / almost as big as Ray Lewis is spins out of it picks up the first down and here we go Toller waves in a 243 in Lewiston 250 is Drive eight minutes to go well the Pittsburgh Steelers have a chance now do a position to move ahead of the Ravens just not the Ravens back to what would be in effect in number five seed and if you're the five Street you know what it means you have to go on the road for a wild card game you're definitely on the road from the next game and the only chance you have to play a playoff game at home is at the sixteen advances from the conference championship game which doesn't happen Boyle this team has not been a good under they Canaan 3 will also send the tightening Jags and Seahawks I mean that's there goes Matthews first down and more and force got a bad this is a tour de force for the San Diego offense light that is 401 yards against the Ravens well you're gonna end up with just a nice jump cut to the outside here Ray Lewis is going to have a pretty clean shot at him again but it's Matthews who now is starting to feel more and more comfortable he had a fumble earlier in the year and north turner had a chance to sit down with him and say listen I was around Emmitt Smith for a long time everybody fumbles this happens relax let your natural ability take over fortunately for San Diego was recovered by manager Dean to Matthew's 23 attempts for 84 yards that race for the number1 seed now all of a sudden becomes even more interesting the Patriots at 11 and 3 if the Ravens lose to go to 10 and 4 if the Steelers win tomorrow night they go to 11 and 3 the Texans are 10 and 4 so the Steelers with a win since they beat the Patriots in Pittsburgh would be with two weeks to go in the season the number one seed there's your AFC West where all of the teams are still alive crazy that the Steelers are limping in the San Francisco Niners have the incentive of just trying to stay into that the two slots so they can get to by the first week of the playoffs on the Saints so many times you see it is the healthiest team going into the playoffs they can make a run I can remember its burg a couple of years ago as a six seed right running through and going on to the Super Bowl we have seen some low seats some wildcard teams make Lee runs unfortunately you got to get there then for the Chargers that is still a tall order but the Green Bay Packers last through Bay Packers last year exactly didn't even win their division third Nate I'm Mike Tolbert so this is a drive that's consumed eight and a half minutes plus starting at the one but has been like this all night I mean it has been long drive after long drive and was very proud defense really hadn't a into tone tonight then it is unexpected to attempt a twentyeight yard field goal the only time the charges haven't scored on the four to seven San Diego shocker Jay Leno this week the Tonight Show Sandra Bullock will be there Carrie Bradshaw or with Jay this where you can lead those folks Nicole Eder those rain I wouldn't have done my impersonation of Bradshaw I know he's coming on there it's right two yards 10 DBM halsy run back 19 left till the celebration at Snapdragon next Sunday night it's Christmas night at Lambeau Field and Aaron Rodgers leads the Packers towards the playoffs against Brian Urlacher and the Bears in the only game on Christmas Sunday night is football night only on NBC the Ravens defense so stellar coming into action tonight and you can see the story in the righthand column what the Chargers have done them on a night with San Diego scored on every possession except one from the 45yard line destroy Philip Rivers and company have been dominant in almost every area of strength for the Baltimore Ravens this Baltimore Ravens defense came in number one in the NFL with 45 sacks they had none tonight they came in ranked number one third down defense San Diego goes six for nine on third down number two in rush defense and the Chargers end up with 136 yards rushing they beat them at their sprints the Ravens will go home and they'll get to Baltimore in the wee hours and then the sixth week Saturday is their game the next game Christmas Eve against Cleveland and then they'll finish at Cincinnati meanwhile Pittsburgh has San Francisco tomorrow night and then the Rams go to Pittsburgh below and they end up at Cleveland so tomorrow night is gigantic for the student to think if they win tomorrow night they're gonna win the division and knock the Ravens down the 40 are my meanwhile the New England Patriots will be wording very hard for the 49ers tomorrow night because of San Francisco wins that game then with two weeks ago New England would be the number one seed and in the AFC West and so crazy all four teams have a chance to win the only team that controls its playoff faith is Denver they won the division the 39 I'm sure there has been can you remember a throat down the field tonight by the Ravens no not a single one in it's mostly because of the lead and so they were able to sit back in coverage but this is a team that really is prided itself on the ability to get the ball down the field and the Chargers have simply taken it away from over and over again and look at the numbers that reflective of that Flacco is 32 for 182 yards not a good night for Joe Flacco had a couple of balls couple of easy reads through interceptions the guys that we're really standing right in front of him you go back there was one played down the field it was his first completion of the night that's so long ago we forgot about it was the Bolden the 33 yards that was and here's addiction 27 the Philip Rivers knew he had to come up with a big night tonight then he was going to be challenged by this defense and he made it look easy and every once in a while somebody would come along and just take the two Ravens it was shocking to watch it san Diego's sack and that'll thickest in the twominute warning let's pray and that is Philips and that is five times tonight that he's hit the deck meanwhile that's Philips down on the ground they stopped the clock at 2:07 now Philips able to smile through a shot in these hitting the helmet from his own guy Antonio grey goes down for a moment but works his way to the bench at second down and his core and that Smith Cory Smith and he's going to go to the end zone with 155 to play so we finally get it down the field 36 yards for a touchdown and after a nice run back by Reid they go 55 yards honey please yeah you want to say where's this bin they clear the middle of the field with the receiver sprinting down the middle to move those deep safeties back and then hit the crossing route underneath you can see there right down the middle the field clear it out work underneath there you don't have to always just take the dump downs if you have the safeties that deep but just a little late getting to it point which he does and with a million 55 to go Wendy's postgame report coming up Michelle will be on the field for an interview Bob Tony and Mike will take a look at the updated playoff picture a lot of changes in that regard today and Chris and I will take a look ahead to Christmas night a week from tonight covered by singing Diego might have been illegal touch early on as the ball was kicked down the field and you get a little extra skirmish ring going on Scheffer southern eye football brought to you by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% of car insurance by the new action fill of the darkest hour in theaters Christmas Day by parental football No Limits only from Sprint and by Toyota Chargers on the Tuesday visited the Doris Miller elementary school surprising the students with bicycle was purchased by the San Diego Chargers team its own has been owned by the Spanos family since the mid 80s once Super Bowl appearance for them and Miami following the 94 it's it's that I felt about does gay what the heck yeah hey why not it has been that kind of a funky day today in the National Football League against the Ravens obviously and so Baltimore scoring a meaningless touchdown meaningless except to some friendly degenerates that we know to make it 34 to 14 and the timeout is taken by Baltimore but it was that kind of date with the Packers getting beat by the Chiefs and the Colts getting their first win against the Titans really hurt you the Titans chances the Texans now you got that question what's going on with them the Giants getting knocked off by the Redskins after being working so good against the Cowboys the Eagles now appear back hitting some kind of a hunt the Eagles are kind of like the San Diego Chargers boy if they got in you'd say maybe you know maybe which they're certainly talented enough I've got a Kansas City Philadelphia Super Bowl City Chiefs the Kansas City Chiefs are still alive Philadelphia is still alive you and I are barely alive I want to thank you for paying the toll on a toll road the other day going down to five bucks thank you guys and Merry Christmas to all of you and we'll talk to you next Sunday night for breathing it'll be interesting to see what the Packers now do you know they're in a little bit of a world of hurt at that tight tackle position there having lost three guys now and so all the talk of the undefeated season and the perfection now you just wonder first of all they got to go clinch the number one seed which you would think that they can probably do against the Chicago Bears but who knows they certainly didn't look very good today no no they played Detroit last year in San Diego this is the end of their home schedule they go to Detroit that's a big game next factory and then San Diego ends at Oakland and what could be an enormous game the last night of the season who knows Denver goes to Buffalo next week Buffalo nothing well obviously but it gone and on the road at Buffalo who knows and the Kansas City goes then Denver Dan the season and Baltimore we talked about this I mean the rest of their schedule not you know prohibitive obviously Cleveland and Cincinnati but Pittsburgh right now Pittsburgh controls not only its playoff fate but where they're gonna wind up in the seeding well it's entirely possible that Cincinnati could be playing for that last playoff spot in that final game and you know then what do you do who knows where the Baltimore Ravens are gonna be at that point but the two wins against Pittsburgh thought we all thought was going to be the definitive moment of this season for the Baltimore Ravens and yet with this loss today now if it's Burke and went out we're right back to where we have been over the past several years with Pittsburgh is the division winner and Baltimore having to come out of the water well what's really nuts too is that Arizona and Seattle are still alive Kansas City stole clinking what the two weeks to go welcome to the NFL hub fourth and two after the ravens spend their final timeout large John's does not draw the flag but you've got coming up short here which is gonna result in a change of possession so they can't run the clock out in North Santa he's everything singing that but I'm trying to make up some stuff I think nor was happier than he's been in a while you know they're on a threegame winning streak now you know you're talking about we did that sort of rollercoaster ride at the beginning of the show but after six losses you come back you win three in a row and no no yyou know the Chargers offensively seemed to have pieced together an offensive line now and who knows make a Tyrod Taylor who is the first was really interesting through the Ray when the season started the Ravens had one gigantic goal and that was to take care of Pittsburgh and they did they beat him on opening day they beat him in Pittsburgh so that was the thing they had to do that was their hunk to get over the hump and now all of a sudden here comes Pittsburgh again pittsburg despite a lot of injuries a lot of issues and that's continuing now with Ben Roethlisberger go we're under the assumption okay Baltimore comes in here takes care of business Pittsburgh might lose in that game tomorrow night and all of a sudden the Ravens are in a perfect position and just the opposite happens sure for John Harbaugh this is a major disappointment as their Road woes continue and as you think about what the wildcard path looks like it is all on the road and we can see no evidence that the Ravens Rhodes this year for sex tonight that's gonna be the end Barnes who have four sacks tonight including one just a moment ago you could have got a hundred thousand to one odds that at the end of the night San Diego would have seven sacks and Baltimore would have none 34:14 saying diego still very much alive at the Wendy's postgame report coming up on the other side of this break welcome to the weenies postgame reports here now Bob Costas so the Chargers back from the brink of oblivion now to the edge of contention with a big win over the Ravens now as for Baltimore and these situations obviously are fluid had they won tonight they would have been at this moment the number one seed in the AFC as we speak they are the number five seed that would be significant for any team maybe especially so in their case because to this point they are seven and OH at home this year and three and four away from home and obviously if they wind up as the five seed or lower they're hitting the road meanwhile we'll send it over to Michele Tafoya who has Philip Rivers and Takeo Spikes Philip the Chargers seem to become a different team in December I explained this I don't know we've just you know good teams finish strong it's a shame we went through that six week stretch but we got two left and we're going we're going to finish like champs and see what happens you're head coach Norv Turner said that this Baltimore defense was potentially the best in the NFL so how are you and your front your line able to do what you did against them we're pretty good too on offense but we probably play our most complete game the defense kept giving us the ball back I don't think we planted tonight it was a good win for us you know every time we win a game everybody says we didn't beat anybody so this is certainly a team that's going to be around in January hopefully we'll be around in January we obviously need some help but Leigh said we're gonna finish strong Denver and Oakland lose you in Kansas City win how do you like your chances now for the postseason we've had worse odds we're four and eight so we got a chance we got a tough to tough road games in Detroit in Oakland but we'll be there congratulations Phillip let's turn to Takeo Spikes Takeo like I said north turner said that the baltimore defense was probably the best in the NFL how do you think you guys measured up tonight i think we played well tonight we came out we understood already we came out we understood what we had to do we had to get turnovers and we knew that as the defensive the owner we had to outplay their defense to even have a chance to win this game it has to be mentioned again you've played in over 200 regularseason games not made it to the playoffs yet what do you think now how do you like the view from where you stand I still love the view my the way that I feel Michele it hasn't changed even throughout the sixgame losing street we had I still believe that we can get there you know and I think everybody puts so much weight on or you go to the playoffs you go to the playoffs I didn't I didn't I don't play this game just to go to the playoffs I played this game to win a wing so you know a minute I'm proud of this team because we we never let nobody else opinion become all reality so I'm very proud of very proud of the guys tonight Takeo thanks but a very passionate Takeo Spikes Bob Costas nice Michele and thanks as well to Philip and Takeo here's the AFC playoff picture four of the six AFC playoff teams are known with only the West champion and one wildcard spot up for grabs Baltimore's loss tonight means the Steelers would be the number one seed if they went out if the Jets and Bengals win their final two it would come down to strength of victory between them that gets complicated and all four AFC West teams can still at least theoretically win the division let's bring in Tony Dungy from New York now Tony a huge win for the Chargers tonight and thus they're still alive they really are and I'll tell you Green Bay got in on the last day of the year last year and I think if San Diego gets in they could be just as dangerous but this was also a big win Bob for the Pittsburgh Steelers they were sitting behind Baltimore and now they know if they win tomorrow they can control things and I believe Mike Tomlin will tell his defense you know our quarterback Ben Roethlisberger won't be a hundred percent defense you may have to win it and I think you're gonna see guys like Troy Polamalu really step up for that Pittsburgh defense and make some plays because they've got so much riding on this game the difference between being the number one seed and then number five seed okay as al mentioned earlier Chargers might not make it but they're a team you don't want to play right now so in the NFC that team is the Eagles perhaps you can still win the NFC's if Philadelphia New York's and Dallas both somehow wind up 88 if Atlanta and Detroit win one of their next two they're both in and it's important to note if San Francisco beats Pittsburgh tomorrow they would retake the number one seed from New Orleans that if both teams should win out I said number one see that meant the number two seed if both teams should win out the 49ers would get to by now now that I've confused half a nation Tony which NFC team stands out to you well to me Bob today it was really the Detroit Lions they're on the road they're down to scores and they need somebody to step up and it was their leaders Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson really making those big plays they needed two scores they got a big one too Calvin Johnson that gave him a chance and then Stafford took them 98 yards and won the game with this throw to Calvin Johnson here and the the thing that that did for them now they can clinch their playoff spot next week at home against San Diego rather than having to go to Green Bay on the last day of the year so this was a huge huge win for the Lions Tony as always thanks we'll turn now to Mike Florio of pro football talk.com we'll have all the big news from week 15 tomorrow afternoon on NBC Sports talk on versus Mike a number of injuries today but first what's the latest on Ben Roethlisberger status for tomorrow night well Bob officially Roethlisberger is questionable which means he's 50/50 with that sprained ankle but the thinking is that now that the Ravens have lost and the Steelers have a chance to take control of the division and get the number one seed in the AFC playoff field Roethlisberger is more likely to play despite that injury in Green Bay right tackle Brian Belaga has a knee injury and his backup Derek Sherrod is lost for the season with a broken leg so issues on the offensive line for the Packers in Chicago scary moments today when receiver Johnny Knox was bent backward he will have surgery tomorrow to stabilize a vertebra the longterm prognosis however for Johnny Knox is good for the patriots defensive end Andre Carter injured a left leg multiple reports are that he is out for the season with a quadriceps injury and one last point Eagles quarterback Michael Vick he missed three games earlier this year with broken ribs he's played the last two the thinking is the ribs have healed we in reality the Eagles had decided in those three games he missed to not give him a pain killing injection they were concerned that he wouldn't be effective with that medication he decided the last two games he wants the injection he wants to play he's played he's been effective and they've won and they're still alive in the NFC playoff chase Mike great info as always Wednesday night on vs. NFL turning point with Dan Patrick takes you inside the week's pivotal plays including Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson leading the Lions to another big comeback win welcome back to San Diego in just a bid the Chargers beat the Ravens tonight 34:14 Allen are back to wrap things up right after this join our team become a fan of Sunday Night Football on Facebook and for live reports throughout tonight's game follow Michele Tafoya on Twitter best an F on NBC until this bearspackers next Sunday night only on NBC welcome back to the Wendy's postgame report here now Al Michaels week fifteen you had seven games in which a team of the losing record beat a team with a winning record including this one tonight of course it was Kansas City against Green Bay and off we go to Green Bay next week so the perfect season is gone but still Green Bay still trying to make sure the road to the Super Bowl goes through Green Bay and Chicago what 7 and 3 but right now 7 and 7 so Jay Cutler gone Matt Forte gone and they're up against the wall here and who's good you know I mean who's the team and we've seen it before we've talked about it before but you almost have to wait until the regular season is completely over and you're starting the playoffs to say all right who's healthy who's playing well and more often than not that's the team that ends up making noise in the playoffs and it's crazy because we talked about all of the things that are happening the fact that Kansas City would still be alive in them in the playoff on Seattle would still be alive Arizona would still be alive it's kind of funny the way this has all worked out and how they've constructed the divisions and I'm sure even when the architects put this whole thing together nobody than the idea it would turn out to be this dramatic but they made a plan and they decided we're gonna go to Green Bay and hopefully we have a little snow on the ground and it'll be a Merry Christmas for everybody and can't wait to see it a little contrast from San Diego yeah there you go a week from tonight Christmas night sir part of your Christmas night with us stern and for Pacific San Diego NBC sports home of Super Bowl 46 thanks you for watching this presentation of the National Football League
