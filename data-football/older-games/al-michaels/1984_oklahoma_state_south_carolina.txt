============================================================

now very good conditions temperature in the mid60s againa bowl is sold out this 40th edition featuring 9th ranked Oklahoma State against 7th ranked South Carolina and from Stillwater ready to enter the Gator Bowl led by coach Pat Jones the Oklahoma State Cowboys they came very close to winning to Nebraska and Oklahoma in a game at man brings bulb in in the big 8 big win over Arizona State 45 3 on opening night they proved early they were serious and wound up with a mark of nine and the Cowboys of Oklahoma State to take on the South Carolina GOx they tell us about 45,000 people have come as they creep there see they have one tindy i'm al michaels been a crazier of course in college football the great debate news number one they finished unbeaten 30 nano and they already took part in the Holiday Bowl last week against Michigan in this year of in college football only two bowls featured is the Orange Bowl Oklahoma against Washington the other is this one and each team was ranked as high as second this season both made a run at a national championship Carolina in fact was not at all before being upset by a navy and then they rebounded to defeat Clemson 22 to 21 while Oklahoma State lost only to perennial powerhouses Nebraska and Oklahoma so it's a very very good matchup Pancho's has done a masterful job in his first season as the head coach at Oklahoma State taking over in June when Jimmie Johnson left to go to Miami and Joe Morrison in his second year finished five insects in his first season ten and one now in his second season we talked about Morrison and his career with the New York Giants for 14 years he saw a lot of men come and go during that 14 years fan one of his teammates is my partner tonight mr. libros Cup who played with seven different teams when he couldn't find Morrison he'd go to people like Dell shakhter throughout his career there was the cover in 61 and now that he's tinting his hair gray areas live simply a shadow of his former self lead Krause cup what do you remember about Joe Morrison well you know I remember Joe Morrison is one of the most levelheaded guys that I've ever known he was able to get his ego out of the way and just go to work he was that way as a player and he's also been that way as a coach and frankly I'm not particularly surprised by his success well his team seventh in the country the opponent 9th ranked strangely enough the 9th ranked team a lower ranked team is a slight favorite in this game do you agree with that assessment well I'm not really surprised but you know I think that they're going to have to get really the same intensity out of their defense tonight that they have and also get a top performance out of their quarterback Mike Holt who is starting only for the second time tonight pretty good job by Jones its Stillwater this year Joe's told us yesterday that he wanted to run the football that would be his number one priority but aside from that he's going to have to play top defense and also get a good work out of his quarterback rusty Hilger so that's the matchup the Gator Bowl sold out in Jacksonville more than 80,000 to look on Oklahoma State against South Carolina with a kickoff coming right up a different twist tonight what we have done is we've wired Pat Jones not only for sound we'll hear from him from time to time but also with a wireless electro cardiogram device and there is the device that is wired to the chest and to that machine here in the goosegirl able to monitor the poultry plant Jones it was in the one there it is 151 again which means his heart is as we get set for the kickoff of this game we're going to learn necessarily have a particularly scientific nature here tonight but different kind of time we'll take a random check it as to just how well Pat Jones is doing in terms of stress dr. wife monitoring and operating the equipment from up here to me what is a game these days without some sort of a decibel meter for the crowd and the Kingdome or Wireless EKG or what have you give Jones everything tonight for the blood workup how about wiring the announcers during the pregame show you think that will happen something normal vulture good between 60 and beats per minute on a normal so Jones feeling a bit anxious and well he should before the kickoff it's a nice day most of the crowd will be rooting for South Carolina Columbia is only 300 miles from Jacksonville fortyfive to fifty thousand people from South Carolina have come considerably less from the state of Oklahoma OSU with Larry Rhodes putting the ball on the tee gets ready to kick off to os you actually won the toy with a lot taking a bounce of a twoyard line and feel white and hesitation wisely so and they stopped the 6yard line Mike hold who had been the relief pitcher all season until the Clemson game the quarterback Thomas Dendy is one running back Quintin Lewis gets the start at the other running back spot IRA Hilary one why not and Eric Poole is the other as far as the running backs are concerned we will also see a lot of Reynard Brown and Anthony Smith go morrison likes to get a lot of people into the game through the course of the season he's been going with a two quarterback system that's ball carrier finding no loom at all no game it will be second down and ten up front Chris Corley's a good one a tight end at 253 pounds averaging 21 yards a catch Karl Womble is the left tackle at 260 then Jim wolf the left guard 267 Tom garner 246 the allamerica right guard is dill wilts bill Barnhill next to him at 257 the South Carolina game second down and with them all at the 6 yard lines delay to tindy and out of bounds he goes at the 11 yard line pushed out there by Adam Hines the defense for Oklahoma State the line ham Harding Washington we talked about O'Neal number 99 and Webb the linebackers Matt monger and Ricki Adams bunker was a walkon originally they earned a scholarship and he's out I mean yes you Oh third down and three then these I of the 15yard line and so the cowboy defense ranked in the top 10 for most of the season as hell James Han makes the stop in South Carolina will kick they were a tough defensive team in 1983 and they continued that way in 1984 that will be their strength tonight the Cowboys hope to set up a return good South Carolina from the 50 it was so an average tick becomes a 54yard tick and the cowboy start at the 31 with rusty Pilger the senior quarterback Thurman Thomas has been their main man of lady just a freshman will Timmons is the fullback Jaime Harris one wideout and the other is Terry Weber tailback oriented offense for Oklahoma State they do the bulk of the ball carrying the fullbacks rarelyseen shuttle them in and out season has progressed Oklahoma State and the Thurman Thomas highly regarded last year as a school boy in Texas berry Hannah is the tight end he's got 27 chuck Shanklin at a Hacienda Heights California Derek Burton 255 founder Dave Tucker is 270 ralph partita with Lyman 256 Paul Blair is a right tackle on second down and seven to the 39yard line will be third down and short third and about two upcoming Sumpter right Woodley and McEntee talked about see right the allamerica Vogel is also a good one Josie right so you don't hear that but in the back now the Cincinnati thing Diego Chargers star third down to two complete to the 49yard for a first down children looks for that high percentage pass most of the time he finds Harris right here first down first of the game Jamie Harris is an outstanding wide receiver running here from his flanker position the leading receiver on the team he runs a hook or curl route he's tackled properly yo you're the leading tackler in the secondary for the Gamecocks and that's exactly right that is what Hills your throws best high percentage passes low ratio of interceptions first down Cowboys from the 49 yard line filter a short drop another Saima Malcolm Lewis close to a first down he's out of bounds at the 41 yard line luis is one of the most talented receivers they have he's only a sophomore 63 210 pounds he caught 23 passes on the year for 341 yards they like to go down the field with this type of possession passing pitches books pearls from the 42 yard line he gets to the 38 James C Wright is in on his first stop along with James Sumpter 47 and we have C right isolated James see right the allamerican and his linebacker position number 45 watches pursues and then closes in right here on the ball carrier he had a hundred and thirty three tackles on the year despite the fact that you match hurry mister games two first downs third after an ET I pick up by Thomas so inauspicious beginning for the Cowboys to hold South Carolina without a first down and are moving down to the 30th second down and 2 every running play has been by the tailback you mentioned they are extremely tailback oriented the fullback is really like an extra pulling guard right now he's carried the ball only 11 season second down to from the 30yard line for a first down to number one Bobby Riley at the 26yard line so three first downs in succession for Oklahoma State Riley again in isolation runs a quick sideline cut gear and he loses a yard coming back Chris major the cornerback is on the coverage and that ball was thrown perfectly by Hilger who is now three for three in the passing department for 25 yards off to a hot start now boys at the 25 soldier going over the middle and the traffic and completing it as he works it in to bury him the tightend gain of about three it will be second down seven berry Hannah one of four receivers with over 20 catches on the year had 27 for two short middle routes I caught five at the cowboys last game against game for the ninth time south carolina looking for its first ever bowl victory second down six looking for it's going up with a great block from Timmons and then it uses the speed to stay outside and nearly make it in for the touchdown hittin Taillow ran him out of bounds the ball is at the three Oklahoma State five carries for 30 makes the tackle level 40 40 second down goal this so far has been a textbook drive for coach Pat Joe yesterday that ideally he would come out running the football he wanted the pound on him with his eye back and throw the high percentage passes so far so good and he saw you know has to be a little this game double tight end set up here with him they fetch it Thomas turns a twoyard loss into a oneyard gain guy at the goal line he has stopped there by Joe Brooks James's brother number 23 and his third and goal Thomas on the pit sweep around the left side lead block from his fullback Timmons again now what's the swarming technique here by a defense that has been labeled for clearance and look how everybody shows up here Thomas again for the touchdown for the state moving down impressively and eating up nearly six minutes in the process particularly on plays like this tail back blast play off the right side great effort by the freshman tailback Thomas who had 680 scores again Jim Morrison known as mr. dependable during his professional career the team as we said earlier very much in His image in Morrison talks about this edition of the South Carolina Gamecocks well I know we got a lot of folks at enjoy playing they enjoy hustling and they enjoy working hard and to be honest I always enjoyed those things and I had a lot of fun playing football and I think we got a great group of young men who had a lot of fun playing football become a big hero in Columbia already who started his coaching career at Tennessee Chattanooga then he went to New Mexico and anywhere all dressed up no place to go I remember that very well I covered in that season Joe Morrison believers now down plates six different positions during the years II with the Giants and part of that as a collegiate he was a quarterback so through the years he managed to play seven different spots never complained about anything to get his ego out of the way and a workman like to add a suit about it Elle is that way he hasn't changed a bit I talked to him for about a half hour yesterday just like a fireside chat old Morrison watching his team nothing bacon by the fiveyard line and brown brings it back to the 16 Reynard Brown is the man perhaps you saw the South Carolina Florida State game the rain yards for a touchdown and the replay indicated that his knee was actually on the ground before he took off with the ball the screw to play but it went for a touchdown in Carolina be Florida State as it turned out 3826 that day they claimed in their films from the side that the knee was a half inch off the ground go over to find the angle first hour from the 16 yard line and recovered at the 10yard line by Mike hold Alan Mitchell the other quarterback may run the option a little bit better than whole apparently is the better passer and he has trouble right here Mike hole trying to come down the line on the option play loses his grasp right here it was part three of the triple option he was looking for the trailing back now they are a split back beer team al but they are atypical of split back beer team in that they only run up two plays about 25% of the trap counter streets second in 16 wrong dangerous pass as it turns out in the flack to Thomas Dendy so Morrison watching as his team tries to get on track controversial call to throw a scream when you're this deep in your own territory now watch what Mike hole does he fakes to his fullback he's looking out to Thomas Denby in the left flat as he sets up the screen fast rot Brown the great one in the secondary for the Cowboys comes up in his right in dendi's face strange call third down from just outside fold is protection breaking down and was at the six that blaze no stranger to the sack getting his first of the night in South Carolina is again a kill without a first down deep in their own territory O'Neil at 13 Saxa season and with a period for the hand over South Carolina will have to kick again Tom O'Conner number eight at the back of his endzone Bobby Riley door i spinning short kick that takes the Carolina vows but then goes out of bounds at the 33 yard line and so here come the Cowboys again from the Gamecock 33 on top seven to nothing 8:00 Eastern Time New Year's night discoverable from New Orleans Tom Osborne and the Cornhuskers of Nebraska ranked fourth against the Tigers of LSU going into the Sugar Bowl under first year head coach Bill Lawrence Parker led by those in Hilliard New Year's here Oklahoma State Thomas and Timmons the running backs it was Thomas the tailback who scored the OSU touchdown and Hill yes protection Roseanna guy off the ball he wolves go to his backs Thomas caught 19 this season and averaged about six yards for reception so hildren now four of five in the passing department should be 5 for 5 with 29 yards Thomas was the only Cowboy rusher on that touchdown drive he had 8 cherries for 40 yards and the touchdown got 33 yard line Willie mac and cheese Hilger the quarterback got the last scholarship offered by the home estate in 1980 Noah the school recruited him he got the twenty ninth and final scholarship an injury 37 forced down number 22 Terry Werner the wide receiver running a deep slant in or a quick post pattern the ball is thrown well by kilcher it's broken up in the secondary thereby for to go over for school Michael getting his second start of the season his only other start in the final game against cleansing talked to him yesterday about the two quarterback situation well you know coming off the bench you got to stay alert and you got to know what's going on and that's what I tried to do all the time and try to pay attention in the game and be ready you know when I did get my call and fortunately when I did I was ready and I think that was probably part of the reason that sometimes I was successful more than sometimes just about every time South Carolina was some dramatic comefrombehind victories and in whole earnings the starting job his fort and he gets to the 37 yard line where he's run down by Leslie O'Neal and Warren Thompson turns it into a seven yard game isolated now on number 99 Leslie only allamerican now watch his concentration here as he loses a blocker pursues the quarterback and you see despite the fact that he's 250 pounds he has four seven speed in the 40yard dash and he's going to be one of the premier defensive lineman Smith and Brown and out of to the 39yard line short of the first down by a yard third and one upcoming it again it's O'Neill along with David Webb in on the tackle as the clock runs down to the fiveminute mark in the first area Mike hold a junior college transfer out of the vases JC in Arizona told me that as the quarterback he's watched in recent years his favorite is John L 'we always throws it away moves around that man right there Joe Morrison told me yesterday where David Webb makes the tackle so South Carolina picks up its first first down Pat Jones the Oklahoma State coach 38 years old played for Frank Broyles at Arkansas wasn't much of a player though with the remember Frank talking about Matt Jones the faculty knew that Jones was it though she would probably make a good one someday they boils into a profit at the 44yard line by Anthony Smith number 49 loss of four second and 14 let's check in with Lynn Swann admittedly the South Carolina team has won and done so well this year because of their most or intensity but with 50,000 plus people down here patting on them on them on the back rooting them on they could cause that emotional intensity to be a deficit for this team a negative they haven't controlled it thus far in the ballgame a bad decision on the opening kickoff and a couple of fumbles they have to control it if they won't have a chance against the Cowboys well they just picked up a first down but now it is second and 14 and scrambling again is hold rolling left and throwing for IRA hillary at the 45yard line of oklahoma state covered by Wendell young isolated once again on number 99 Leslie O'Neal at his defensive tackle position works off the blockers spins away now he's pursuing Mike hold once again he's the man applying the pressure it takes three men to ultimately get him down Karl warble number 57 is the man who does it bowl is all for his Christian high today from the 44yard line they trail seven nothing and nearly intercepted Eric pool the intended receiver and Mark Moore got his hands out of a 44 4000 kaylynn is a play here what's the tip right number 44 mark 4 in the defensive secondary you see that leaping ability coming over also is Adam Hines number 14 so good effort there in the secondary by the Cowboys third South Carolina pun is O'Connor puts it in the air end over and announces at the 21 yard another good game 20 the season that 148 yards not particularly artistic but it did get the job done as Oklahoma State is backed up and there's a penalty marker down the officiating crew is out of the Atlantic Coast Conference the call home estate a person referee tonight SCC Daly so the ball was down at the three and the personal foul will take answer distance to the goal line so from a oneandahalf in Zachary comes in as the fullback and Thomas who stole a tailback in the by a score of seven to nothing with three minutes and 19 seconds remaining in the first quarter victory awaits in a powerful matchup number four nebraska unleashes the nation's top defense on the 12th ranked LSU Tigers in the Sugar Bowl Tuesday on ABC Sports I don't know that this scene is getting much of a rating in the state of South Carolina I say that because I think the entire state is in Jacksonville tonight seems like that is attainable where everybody is Oklahoma State starting from its oneyard line as Ken Zachary take it out to the fore it will be second down and eight I saw about 500 I've met our hotel today they say about 45 to 50 thousand people have come down and they say there was a pretty good traffic jam on i95 which from the state of South Carolina go let's the 5yard line Cowboys just look for some breathing room here and it will be third down and seven that's a real upset when the fullback here is the ball have been going with the freshmen Thomas for the most part at tailback back oriented Zachry the 11 regularseason games at 17 in the you're on a short roll sir just being a little bit time for that look here from behind the quarterback as he Sprint's out to his left he looking for until brookes number 23 comes up from his safety position nearly intercept that ball and as al said had he caught it would have been an easy trip to the endzone Carrie Cooper to punt Cooper and endoverend short kick bouncers at the 35 one yard line so South Carolina in good shape at the 41 and let's pay a visit to the campus of Oklahoma State University worldwide water supplies are endangered with a new facility in which research will protect our renewable natural resources folk Lahoma State University investigators are looking at the dangers to water OSU is a strong research the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville Florida Al Michaels and we grow stuff and Lynn Swann in South Carolina has it at the 42 of Oklahoma State first and 10 and how the Gamecocks gained on that exchange of this is Thomas dandy back of Lewis who seemed late pays the pranks he is offended back of the line of scrimmage by Rodney Harding number 42 six to 240 pounder from Oklahoma City that is not opportunistic quit beau when you get the bone that kind of field position you have to make them pay statistics show when you get the ball inside the 50yard line after it but such as that that you should score 70 percent of the time is owned by Chris Wade freshly member Tula every hold wait my coal shows a perfect pass to number two Chris Wade who is running post pattern here he is he has everybody beaten in the secondary the ball is thrown perfectly he has it in his hands it is the classic run the most frustrating thing that can happen either to a receiver or a quarterback so hold is now old for four but he's had to drop and here's his reaction he knows he has a touchdown and then curtains 1:17 to go in the first period delay five against the gametime that puts it back at the 49yard they'll have game on the offense turf down in professional football sometimes careers can be measured by dropped passes if you're a marginal quarterback their shows from the ACC third down and 17 but then pushback is Chris poorly Carly caught the ball at just about the spot he for a first down which is then he's pushed back he takes outside weaves my cold cesium in the middle see where he is originally as L told you he loses in the better mark but not enough for the first down still it's force down in at the 33yard line runningback Quentin Louis number nine the counterplay foot back beer finds a big hole up the and he is a good allaround he also throws the option pass very success 12 seconds remaining in the quarter first down from the 23 yard line going for six and throws it out of the end zone and not a lot of room there as Hillary goes right into the chainlink piece so it's the think moves to it the corner of the end zone you better have the presence of mind to know exactly where you are when you run into the corner here two seconds to go in the period IRA Hillary as work more beat there but watch what happens that last defender was really tough great and like Ron run into an at the 15yard line we'll try it at the other end of the field with a certain play upcoming is restarts a second career pretty much indicative of the kind of first quarter it was no turnovers identical times of possession there at the bottom line and pretty much even in terms of overall statistics it's pretty much of the ballgame we predicted at the top would be a close hardhitting lowscoring game and as we start the second quarter third down and ten as Old West so a frustrating drive they still wrestle for it number fiftyfour but South Carolina not only loses a fumble but watch the touchdown goal with my cold never has control of this ball as he's trying to spin and hand off to Thomas Dendi he may not have gotten the ball properly from the center but he that is a Bey Rickey Adams number 54 covers the ball for the Cowboys and that's the fake because that's a drive killer and they had the backup Center in there and for a minimal gain stop by James she write the allamerica linebacker number 45 Simpsonville South Carolina talk to Joe Morrison yesterday told me that see right reminded him a little bit of one of our former teammates got in quick Livingston I don't be around hibari got most of us guys are quite walltowall for the Giants ten from the 26 yard into a short game actually just about no game getting back of the line of scrimmage Willie McEntee making the tackle in the concept of possession passing that's really kind of like a long hand off to the tailback when they fill that little swing out there and it's something that Pilcher does with quite a bit of consistency you got a back working over the world third down and ten from the 26 guy Thomas who takes it out near midfield little shovel action right there I remember the play very well in fact as the Utah past because my former coach Cactus Jack Curtis was the architect of the plane now watch there it is it's a little shovel pass Thomas comes underneath and Richy get you get a doubleteam and you get a little open action there and it creates a lane and it can be very effective so first down at the 46 yard line after a 20 yard pickup yogurt requires two Lewis number eight who makes the cash in South Carolina territory at the 45yard line it'll be second down to where that point got its name that you saw passes that in 1957 were used it so effectively against army that Navy stole the play the following Greek used it on that the announcers refer to it as the Utah pass they've been calling it that ever since second down nothing doing for Thomas who tries to fight his way forward for a first down they have to get to the 44 yard line he appears to be just shy a third and less than the one early second quarter Oklahoma State on top seven to nothing in a bowl game matching two teams in the top ten South Carolina coming in seventh in both wireservice Falls Oklahoma state line up in the face spot it whereas forward progress took him he should have the first down Bogle popped him but he appeared to get it at all depends on the spot now looks like a lock to me shuri head they line up it is the first down boy yardline good call by Hildred you eliminate the ballhandling he has the size you like he's 6 for 205 pounds you mentioned he's the quarterback nobody wanted he's improved steadily both physically and mentally during the time Oklahoma State last year he was listening to positive thinking shape improve his consciousness 44 yard lines Hilger and complete for the 39 very henna we told you about our wireless electrocardiogram and our wireless pulse rate meter 114 beats per minute remember at the asset of the game he was up to around 50 beats for me I'm sure is insurance agent is looking on what a casual interest tonight purpose of course to measure psychic stress its second down from the 44 thunder to the 42 fine as Hilger finds Riley Bobby Riley number one for a short game maybe four it will be third down and six at the South Carolina 40s 11:55 remaining in the first half Oklahoma State on top seven to nothing this is a big third down play right now for quarterback rusty Hill jury normally goes to his wide receivers but in filter and he takes it for the 30yard line right over the middle fear by quarter and very Hannah just a little delay best back across the metal as I mentioned a moment ago has been one of the plays they have used effectively in third and obvious past situations because of the fact that they usually tend to gang up on the wide receiver Cowboys on the South Caroline perfect a short drop and complete for the flag right there as well as Jaime Harris was tied up by Otis Morris second team quarterback and covered them covered too well Jamie Harris on a hitch pattern look at this he just hitches up right here and this is a premature contact that he'll pass interference automatic first down first kid doesn't take a Phi Beta Kappa glad because I don't think they're already in the mood anyway first down from the 25 yard line that's a 19yard line so they've been going with Thomas at the iBot high back spot throughout the course of the game to this point though they do have people like Charles Crawford and Sean Jones who could see quite a bit of action before this confrontation between Blair and C right right here and Blair is winning it number 72 battling the allamerican number 45 he controls him long enough to let the tailback get outside for we're soon he takes you to the six yard line we can see that the moves that Thomas is exhibiting why he was so highly recruited good look at the wall formation plays once again it's Paul Blair number 72 leading the way post of tacklers there in the secondary is the fire ants start 14 carries 483 Texas last year lines up in the starting lineup kilcher calling for the corner of the endzone and incomplete second down tended receiver was Jeanne Harris Sammy Harris one of the fastest players on the squad has worldclass speed and he's also very effective as a possession receiver he's one of those guys who just keeps getting better and better it's been two years with the Cowboys now originally was a Texas Tech played there for a couple of seasons and had to sit out a year 26 this season so it'll be third down and goal another one of the classic tailback plays sometimes referred to as shootin body right one time colleague Ben Martin who was watching tailback well as that student body right way that's it's become a buzzword now for about the last 20 years SC Simpson Rickey Bell and others timeout is called here by Oklahoma State with 944 to go in season premiere January 5th coming up to shows you're very familiar with the Pro Bowlers during ABC's Wide World of Sports but loads of new times the Pro Bowlers who are getting underway at 3:00 Eastern Time and then Wide World of Sports commencing at 4:30 Eastern Time on Saturday the 5th of January Mary Lou Retton will be in action on the 5th you will see her and her first performance since the Olympics in Los Angeles and also mark breelands second professional bout on wide world possessed the January oklahoma state calling a timeout I'm 40 he looks to Clun he's going to throw back the hill journey has a fresh fix down quarterback to tailback touchdown the season against closed yes they have used this plane before go to the gadget place the throw back to the quarterback always lazy's out here to the left Walter on with a nice soft looping trajectory by Thomas for the touchdown the stamp was airman and so they have to turn it into a futile twopoint attempt that is unsuccessful and aniline right there is convert the extra point and their lead is 13 to nothing with 9:30 to go with a hand on the previous play by senator Jerry Col number his holder Adam signs number 14 results in a mad scramble here in the hinds a defensive back who is was a onetime quarterback tries to make the most of it by destroying a Hail Mary 13 to nothing oklahoma state a slight favorite coming into the game very impressive drive this one 15 plays 74 yards and with 939 to go and a half the Cowboys are on top by two touchdowns but it all turned around with that fumble by Mike hold what you think back on is that maybe were the turning my cold is going to be very important unless of course the game and the drop pass because it would have had a touchdown the sideline here the 40 I line the flag goes down as Jones runs over and admonishing one of his own men right there for a possible late hit let's get the call and it's a personal foul against Oklahoma State might have been on it maker Larry Rhodes number nine then after a good run back that's going to cost a 15 from its own 42 down to the 43 of Oklahoma State here's a call dead ball personal foul against the white king fish founded kin here is the personal foul right at the end Larry Roach the kicker number nine gets us late hit on raters Brown then you saw Jones go running right over to him to admonishing port as hold tries to get things started actually in a way this is a typical South Carolina game against clumsily we're down twenty one to three came back to beat him twenty two to twenty one it was hole who kept coming off the bench almost week after week in release of Alan Mitchell to pull out victory after victory even though he did go all the way again looking at his team in a 13point hole we still had a that'll be our first film so panko watching his team have a pretty good lather here on a otherwise was it mine exact chieftain takes it to the 43 gain of six it will be second down and Allen Mitchell who had been the starter most of the year is considered to be more of the typical beer option type quarterback cold however is a better passer better scrambler and the master of the big play he's considered one of the most exciting players they hand second and four for 43 off to play face number 44 mark more who batted away to flex this one intended for Hillary tail end of the last play IRA Hillary has a Stepan mark more number 44 or gets just a little piece he is also one of the artists hitting banks in the big 8 conference only defensive back for NASA movement seventytwo David point said with some illegal movin fossum five back to the 48 yard line you look on the right side of the screen you're going to say some illegal motion right there it was like Jim Walsh number 77 wall screw the man so it's third down at nine let's see the party in its job Harding to come in get the sack this is how it looks when you're a quarterback under duress Rodney Harding number 42 one of the players who plays with so much intense on that premier defensive unit for the Tommo cutter Hey it filled it at the 15 a fair tax was made there by Bobby Riley and so the Cowboys have it back and for a 41yard eleven to go in the half its Oklahoma State leading 13 rusty Hilger the Oklahoma State quarterback spoke with him yesterday and here's the way he describes his style conservative I think it's a good word for I think in conservative in in in play and also in actions off the field alright I don't feel like in our game plan that the quarterback is going to be the major factor in the win over a loss of a game like I stated earlier and I don't think that our play my place at quarterback has been too conservative through the season and and I hope there's not gonna be conservative in this next ball game I think it's gonna be a big factor in the game winner lost this time around so far so good for him two long drives he's engineered his team lead 30 nothing Oklahoma State from the 15yard line I had a chance to visit with rusty right after you did Ellen I asked him who he particularly admired when he was growing up as a quarterback he said Roger Staubach was his hero and times I see is some similarities way sets up releases the ball moves around let them into three ballgames Oklahoma State second down and Thomas takes it to the 18 yard line those are hopes to wind up getting a shot in the pros you know hear a lot of talk about Schillinger getting drafted certainly not in the I round who knows maybe in the USFL latchon is a free agent somewhere you never know if he continues to make the progress he's made the last three years he might develop into something 205 pounds third and seven Jamie Harris what we had there was a breakdown in communication he was throwing a hitch Harris was running a fly pattern oh it into be happy about and South Carolina will get the ball back as Carrie Cooper a freshman from Broken Arrow Oklahoma 7:06 to go in a half for the Cooper it's a line the 46 yard line and stop right there his Jerry Dunlap Thurman Thomas playing on his special teams got down to make the tackle after a 37yard punt Oklahoma State leading South Carolina 13 to nothing with 657 remaining in the first half talk about the Sugar Bowl coming up New Year's night and then the big one January 20th the Super Bowl Super Bowl 19 Stanford Stadium with a purse with the pregame bishop at four o'clock Eastern Time on Sunday January 20th the Superbowl to the 47 for a gain of one will be second down mentioned earlier the Gamecocks are not your typical split back beer team and that they only run the opposite way about 25% of the time they use a lot of that sort of action the power pitch the sweeps the pitch outs the counter plays they do a lot of trapping off of this foot back there Joe Morrison really likes a lot more multiplicity and flexibility in his offense than say your typical of on second down at the 45yard fortytwo Rodney Harding in there again but with all of what I just said obviously the Cowboys have a good scouting report on Joe Morrison's team because so far they have done a good job of bottling up all of their key plays and particularly that counter trap play right up the middle then again it would be a sixpoint difference at Chris Wade hell at a four touchdown pass Michael's going to his favorite target Iowa Hillary number one who runs a cheap sideline he goes down about yard breaks it to the sideline all in perfect shape Leslie O'Neil isolated once now pressures mic hold right there but mold has already released the ball always coming with no room for Dendi it's Leslie O'Neal's level 99 in on the tackle counter play out of the split back beer and that's not the place to run that's going right into the feet of their defense when you run a big number 99 Leslie O'Neill O'Neill having a good night 42 rodney party having a good night second down and nine from the 36yard line having some trouble with the handoff Carolina puts the ball on the ground and for the second time Oklahoma and come up with a recovery Quentin Lewis number nine on part one of the triple option is hit and then loses the ball it's recovered by Rodney Harding number 42 has not been a very good first half of the gamecocks as the Cowboys take over again with 439 to go in the first half sometime and the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville Florida nothing at the 35yard rusty Hilger the quarterback the 38yard line he's not there by James C right good job of improvising there by quarterback rusty Hilger as I mentioned before he has the size of a he's a big guy six for 205 pounds good athlete has a good sense of the field he scanned the field saw that everybody was covered rather than take an interception the tailback is Carl Crawford after Thomas had gone all the way Crawford number 32 6 to 230 pound tailback the fullback is Ken Zachary at the 40 yard line by Paul Vogel number 44 quite a play by Paul Vogel's there because he had to ward off three blockers in the screen and then he came up with a ball carrier C Reich is all of the publicity miss Mason when you've got a guy who you think can make all America like a C right you've got to talk them up get the writers to talk about them in the broadcasters and then a guy like Vogel suffers because of it third down and five from the 40 yard line children over the middle and complete for Malcolm Lewis through his hands and so it'll be forth 916 Pacific Louis on the breakin pattern right little out of reach possibly catchable would have been a circus catch and he made it and it's Cooper to kick now with very Dunlap I kick out a hole on a distance say fair cactus call for but he lets it bounce and it is down at the 32 yard line so have it there and we'll take a look at the campus of the University of South Carolina hold back to pants on first down and throws incomplete intended for the tight end first corley everybody was pretty wellcovered old improvising and then throwing it away it is second down in ten took place to throw that one Joe Morrison 14 years with the Giants 12 year overall record as you can see in food cyst in sat Tennessee Chattanooga New Mexico and now South Carolina for Morrison address in the course of the 84 season the 39yard and the gain of all is written at night a sea of black the Blackmagic season for the gamecocks strength and mystery is the way the Gamecock backers put it and for the first time ever this team won 10 games in the season prior to that the I was eight he pitches the ball back to rain and first down what's one of the exciting plays back there they sometimes called the counter option we like to talk refer to it as the whirlybird by the quarterback but it it's a cute little move here by Mike hold as he spins the action starts one way that it comes the other nice footwork and the pitch to the trailing back Reynard Brown the fastest man on the team that long return earlier on the two minutes now raynard bro boy territory to the 45 we O'Neill the gamecocks have all three timeouts remaining in the client 1:43 142 and counting down and second down and one up coming at the 45yard line the more typical spliff back second middle one raynard Brown back at the 41 again trouble was the execution and instead a second and one is going to be third down and 13 trying to come again with the counter option play that worked moments ago the pitch to the trailing back Reynard Brown it's read perfectly by Rodney Harding number 42 who's right in position there to make the stop have there not been abundant timeout is taken by South Carolina that's their first the clock is stopped now with 115 but more importantly they got to come up with a way to pick up 14 yards on a third down call as they trail 13 to nothing as being some safe no no no I would listen I would go ahead and go in something safe you know if they hit one net where have you prepared for us no hardly so you make a first down down in there Pat Jones we have him Mike and he not only is the head coach but is the former defensive coordinator so he's right at home right here doesn't want a blitz third down and fourteen upcoming Pat Zone to agree to wear a mic very cooperative and it was nice to hear his caller he said he definitely did not want a blitz so they're going to be playing more to the 50yard line but he is six yards shy of the first down he's run down by number 90 mat mugger and the clock is down to a minute remaining and South Carolina will take a timeout here so that's their second they have one remaining as they get ready to make the play on fourth and six when we come back again a visit to the camp actually have coming up for you at halftime South Carolina at least lines up in punt formation will they kick it well yes they do they decide to boot it away off the foot of O'Connor inside the tenyard line and that will pin the Cowboys g58 so Morrison after thinking it over I guess figured Li at this point fourth and six if you don't make it not only do you turn the ball over but you turn it over in midfield with enough time for the Cowboys to score again and that could be disastrous for South Carolina I think it was definitely a wise decision he's trailing by 13 points and if they don't score any more he can come back in the second half and not need to depart too radically from his initial game plan and they have been a strong secondhalf team anyway extremely in their 11 games this season they have trailed at the half in five of those 11 games and they lost only one game all season that was to Navy after they've gone nine and oh they went up to Annapolis and the next thing they knew the score was 38 to 7 in favor of the Naval Academy Carolina made it closer at the end but that turned out to be their only loss and in the meantime the Cowboys will take a timeout here is they get set to start from their 8 yard line and we listening to Pat Jones will open up his mic wait a minute hi humming how many timeouts they got left reach they got one they got one timeout left right okay but it's all about it nope a Jones giving you the strategy right there they'll just fall on the ball knowing that he can run the clock out at this point and go into the locker room but halftime leading 13 to nothing I think you'll take that too good sustained drives and also a big break for Oklahoma State when the wide receiver Chris laid they short touchdown fans in the so no jury with this banana won the Carolina can stop the clock once if they so desire that dropped past by Wade coupled with the fumble by hold really has made this a different ballgame so South Carolina does not stop the clock with a final timeout just one more play remaining in the first half very quiet crowd as we say most of the crowd partisans of the Gamecocks about ten or fifteen thousand Oklahomans have made it to Jacksonville but the first half has belonged to the Cowboys offensively and defensively and we reach the hand that the Gator Bowl in Jack 40th anniversary of the Gator Bowl and the Cowboys of Oklahoma State lead South Carolina 13 to nothing conservative offense you think that aided your ballclub in the first half from making mistakes a lot tell you Leonie time we weren't run shovel paths and quarterback throw bass you know we're wide open jokers for us but those didn't be set up by the conservative play the ground attack the short passes you know we are a little bit bigger we didn't feel like that we need to try to pound out them a little bit see if we could if we could we're gonna keep on doing it kicking games kill let's go out playing very good at kicking it with didn't feel those punch had a bad snap mr. field goal was sure to make kicking game as hurt us well you think they'll do in the second half the county your success in offense I think as long as it stays like this they're just kind of keep on plugging away and doing about what they've been doing it you know hope for a break if we can get a little bit more lead they'll have a go I think South Carolina coach in that first half what did you tell your team in the locker room about the first half they seemed to have a big play slip away from defense we played pretty well in the first half offensively we didn't play very well at all and unless where you start moving the football and put some posts on the board it's going to be a long evening for so I think some of our young men are just trying a little bit too hard that they just go out and relax and play like capable plan I think we can get back in the ball game League rosscup seems to think that maybe in the second half he'll try to run the football a little bit more on first down a little more playaction passing well you know you got to make the run go to have that play actually be effective for you if we got a short time up a little bit and not trying to go deep all the time only a few inches away from that big play but in the second half will we see Mitchell coming in ballgame along yeah that's good possibility we'll just wait to see how it goes here after the first couple of series okay coach good luck Tina second half how I thank you Lennon that would be a switch of course because it's been hold replacing Mitchell all season long and hold one all the way and there is hole number seven in the first half and it could be the reverse situation developing here 13 to nothing Marcin stadium the defense is an adequate job offensively the key in luck a statistic as opposed to the first quarter you see two the University of South Carroll that's really been the difference in the football game time of possession still relative the stats are someone even Ellie you see the dominance there in total yardage of all records every seat sold at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville 80 2138 this game has learn to kick off the courtyard we'll come the Cowboys up against this Carolina defense team
