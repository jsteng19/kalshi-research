============================================================

and one man he'll be seeing a lot of prosafety of the Pittsburgh Steelers Troy Polamalu as the Broncos beat the Steelers in a doozy of an opener on Sunday Night Football now Michael is Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya welcome to Denver where TiVo mania has been supplanted by Manning mania you know the story Payton 14 seasons with the Colts has undergone four neck surgeries in the last year and a half hasn't played a game in 20 months and here he goes to mind in his Broncos debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers will come off a year in which they went 12 and four had the number one ranked defense in the league where he's shocked to you in the Wildfire game by Denver and Tebow last January they've had a lot of changes during the offseason but once again a legitimate Super Bowl contender Chris here we go Peyton Manning we watched in practice the other day we watched the preseason talked to MacLean what do you expect tonight he looked pretty good to me so we'll see but you have to wonder what's going through his for neck procedures a new team a new city the Steelers defense which was ranked number one in the NFL a season ago and it means so much to them you can just feel it when you talk to them but it's not going to be easy I've got butterflies for him he goes against the Pittsburgh Steelers as I say a lot of changes but once again the team that figures very much to be there at the end of year yeah and I'm interested to see what their offense is going to look like you know they have been thoughtless burger and some of the best wide receivers in the game and yet you get the feeling they want to go back to some of their old Pittsburgh Steeler ways and run the football but they don't have Rashard Mendenhall tonight so is that really what they do best it's Pittsburgh and Denver what a way to open up the season meanwhile for the Pittsburgh Steelers one of their problems is the fact that Ryan Clark cannot play at high altitude for more on that lets go to Michelle that's right now the Pro Bowl safety for the Steelers has the sickle cell trait in his blood and that can become lifethreatening when he exerts himself in high altitudes he first discovered this danger back in 2007 when after playing a game here had to have his gallbladder and his spleen removed he hasn't played in a game here since and that includes last season's post game loss when the Denver Broncos completed four deep balls against the Steelers secondary and not surprisingly Peyton Manning calls Clark's absence tonight significant but Clark told me he plans to contribute tonight he wants to be an extra set of eyeballs on the sideline for his teammates and how also out tonight Steelers Pro Bowl linebacker James Harrison will miss the game he is still nursing a left knee injury ow all right Thank You Michelle also Rashard Mendenhall a very special night on a number of levels right now let's join the PA announcer Alan Roche with the coin to us lined up right Denver's won the toss will receive this boy DS and gentlemen please welcome tonight's honorary captain winner of five medals overall including four gold at the London Olympics Colorado's own Missy Franklin perfect night in Denver and here we go Pittsburgh against Denver Sunday Night Football is brought to you by Subway restaurants home of the famous fivedollar footlong by Hyundai new thinking new possibilities and by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% or more Spanish audio provided by Telemundo NBC Sports welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League mike tomlin turned 40 years old in March he is in his sixth season as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers he's taken them to two Super Bowls winning one and his opposite number is John Fox in the second year as the Broncos hit folks after nine seasons as the head coach of the Carolina Panthers took them to one Super Bowl which they lost to New England in a thriller Broncos won the toss they elect to receive that means we will see Manning immediately and on the spotlight in Denver with the temperature in the mid80s the crowd will already in an uproar not a cloud in the sky Omar Bolden will drop back that Shawn sleaze them and will kickoff for the Steelers and now you just wonder will they come right out with the nohuddle offense we talked to several of the Broncos players it's hot tonight of course you got the thin air your opening night or a lot of times you're not in the absolute best shape that you could be in will Peyton come out attacking from the first play you might come out on the 20yard line because most of the kickoffs in this stadium at 5,280 feet lined up as touch backs last season 80% of the kickoffs excluding onside kicks wound up as such facts go from Denver Colorado into the stands and so here comes Manning now for the first time since he was at the University of Tennessee in 1997 wearing a different uniform at least it's orange hasn't played since a wild card game against the New York Jets following the 2010 season the four neck procedures and away we go with the Manning era in Denver Willis McGahee is his running back is a simple pain walk and the day he picks up five as he takes it up to the 25yard line tackle their bike Taylor Payton visited Denver he visited Arizona and Tennessee and then the 49ers and dolphins visited him and a lot had to do with the fact that John Elway is here running the show in Denver which brings him to the Rocky Mountains from the gun now on second and five Manning's first pass as a Bronco right on the money to Eric Decker and a first down up to the 38 yard line Decker and Thomas are his key wideouts and also Brandon Stokley has come aboard as well as former teammate Lindy the thing that stuck out to me most was watching the protection of the Denver Broncos they have been almost perfect during the course of preseason and you should see them practice it going over every little detail and you knew the Steelers were gonna come test them early first one they answer correctly it's like they're guarding a museum piece here's a fullback that's crisp on Koski and the gain is 3/4 McGehee and let's take a look at the Bronco starters Peyton Manning University of Tennessee Willis McGahee Miami Demaryius Thomas Georgia tip Eric Decker Minnesota Joel Driessen Colorado State Jacob Tamme Kentucky Ryan Clady Boise State Zane Beadles Utah go Utes JD Walton Baylor Manny Ramirez Texas Tech Orlando Franklin to you by way of Tron County and Tammy provides another link to the past played with him with the Colts a couple of years back my second down and seven traffic tried to jam it in there too Driessen who gets doubled covered and the pass is incomplete it'll be third down and seven Greece and coming over from the Texans but one of the problems with safety Ryan Clark being out as you end up seeing Troy Polamalu and a lot more deep coverage it actually got him in trouble in the playoff game because he's a guy that is so dynamic and makes big plays he wants to attack he wants to make interceptions and sometimes just sitting back and being the free safety can be a bit of a struggle and that's much been much more Brian Clarke's over the wall with this thing third down and seven now Manning which on again slides left and competes in and that's Brandon Stokley can't seizure taken down by Cortez almond and the Broncos up backtoback first down will Dick LeBeau the defensive coordinators trying to bring the pressure look at all the guys they're coming right up the middle and trying to get Peyton a little happy feet going but Brandon Stokley on the outside now they have been doing this for a long long time isn't it amazing how they can just keep doing it sort of like Johnny Unitas and Raymond berry they almost know what the other ones thinking out there timeless from the 50 now the Blitz that was Polamalu the blocking but Moreno has no place to go he's the backup number one draft choice from Georgia no.9 but McKay he's number one Moreno coming off an ACL tear is number two you knew he wasn't gonna sit back for very long they're kind of Troy Polamalu and Stokely may have saved the day at least for my fumble huge collision in the backfield but when you talk to Dick LeBeau he said listen you cannot sit back and just wait on pain man and he'll pick you apart you would have to take your shots where the ball is going in the endzone second opening drive that's coming again flag thrown first of the game in the past is dropped by Demaryius Thomas who made that catch for 80 yards on the touchdown in the overtime game to beat Pittsburgh in January Taylors covering first penalty of the game still the replacement official officials Gerald Wright who's done a lot of officiating in his career several conferences even going back to the old Western Athletic Conference he retired insurance salesman from Albuquerque Mike McCoy is the offensive coordinator for so many years we were used to seeing Tom Moore on the sidelines at Indianapolis sending in as Tom used to say concepts and some McCoy with part of his system and part of what Payton feels comfortable in on the headset Manning calling the plays into Peyton's helmet Marino stays in the backfield on third and 10 swallowed up and that's Larry foot number 50 he's been around a long Michigan who gets the sack and it's fourth down that time it's Knowshon Moreno who misses the block they really had this thing protected pretty well one on one pass protection he just lowered his head and that was what cost him and this is going to straight sound strange now but sometimes as a quarterback or as a player in the NFL getting hit for the first time actually is a positive thing because it settles you down a bit Britton Colquitt is the kicker Antonio Brown oh and a fantastic year not only receiving the running back kickoffs and punts he is the team MVP and brownies have snubnosed and can't get out of his own way and the Bronco meanwhile Ben Roethlisberger is also in the game we'll see him next Sunday Night Football brought to you by Southwest Airlines can find our fares online alias southwest.com by Hyundai new thinking new possibilities by NFL mobile from Verizon though to bring you the games but but life isn't here of NFL fans here we go good the night back to football pep rally in Denver yeah signing autographs we gonna shoot the balls is out so written in history Roethlisberger starting his season with an ebook to Redmond who had a pretty good day here in the playoff game last year after Mendenhall had suffered his knee injury he's still recovering from that so here is Roethlisberger and the big question is as Chris talked about it at the top with Tom Haley coming in and Bruce Arians being let go and now an Indianapolis there is last year's head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs and before that at Arizona he's been a temper and his Roethlisberger said he's the only guy that could make Kirtley on their curse second and seven to the outside the 17yard line sealers were right one dominant last year so this time they go to the left want to become more balanced of net reward and he doesn't like the cold a long time tithe and Ethier at a Virginia dad Heath Miller working on Von Miller right here and bond Miller just an outstanding working a season ago eleven and a half sacks and that's going to be a battle all night they're going to provide extra help on the edges for their tackles because two of the best pass rushers in the league in this game for denver not only bought and miller but elvis do mer bill that does a very healthy team coming in not so the Steelers of course with Clark out Harrison out and men second and 15 from the six and they're on a drawer take him down Joy said that Cincinnati this meet the Steelers Ben Roethlisberger Miami University Isaac Redmond boos deep will Johnson West Virginia my walls will parallel the high school Antonio Brown Central Michigan Keith Miller Virginia Mac Starks Florida Gators willing to loan off the university Marquis Pouncy Florida Ramon foster cinesín marques Gilbert universal floor stare down and from the six with the stadium shaking as Berger throws and is able to slip it in there to Mike Wallace between two defenders Wallace held out through all of CAM just showed up last week hasn't practiced very much didn't play in a preseason game and he's very close to a first down Mike Wallace wasn't touched initially I don't think so he got to get up but he still was tackled by Tracy Porter who came over from the Saints before he was able to pick up the first down that appeared and they will bring in the chain gang right now for Mike Wallace this is a new offense new terminology he's really only been practicing for a week and because of all the crowd noise they were concerned would he know all the hand signals and such that goes with a game like this and he's going to be a couple of links short of the first time then as much as that offense would like to go for it Mike Tomlin knows a little bit better you're not going to give Manning the ball that around the 20yard line so now you've got drew Butler coming into Keck he is a rookie punter out of Georgia and the former jet Jim Leonard is back there to receive it so this will be Butler's first NFL kick his father Kevin was the placekicker you'll recall him with the Chicago Bears between the mid 80s and the mid nineties in fact Butler won a Super Bowl ring his dad did with the fabled 85 Bears and then ended his career with the Arizona Cardinals nice place to make a debut as a punter at 5,280 see I not get that average up around 68 and call it a career and the kick is a low line drive and Leonard takes it back at the 28 yard line looking for room or on the outside and down he goes at the 40yard line this world makes the tackle batting out for the second Broncos series Peyton Manning we heard about him a lot of people did when he was in great school son of Archie and Olivia went to Dumon high school in the early 90s and then to the University of Tennessee had a spectacular career in Knoxville Indianapolis the number one overall pick in 98 through 11 and here he is in orange again from Rocky Top to the Rocky Mountains Manning starts the game to a floor for 22 yards first down at the 40 with McGehee the running back McGahee swinging to the outside gain of four up to the 44 tackle by foot now you can do this as well as I can you've seen him throw as many balls maybe more than I have and this kind of looks the same there was a play against the San Francisco 49ers in preseason in which he released one Harris Harrelson just absolutely thrilled him completed a long ball down the field and that was kind of the moment that you got the feeling that he is back you know whether or not he's really sharp at this point you don't know but he's capable second down and six and that pass is brought on the outside by Thomas and Thomas is able to slip the initial tackle steps away from Luis it'll be third and short let's take a look at the defense regular Missouri JC handsy Texas Brett Keisel Grable high school go buff Lamar Woodley University of Michigan Larry Foote Michigan Lawrence Timmons Florida State Chris Carter Fresno State Keenan Lewis opalocka high school Troy Polamalu University of Southern California Ryan Bundy Woodland Hills High School I'd C square University the Pittsburgh Dean number one last year and number one against the runner there's a fumble and it winds up in the hands of the Steelers so on a third down one the Pittsburgh Steelers come up with a football as Lamar Woodley is the beneficiary of the fumble Troy Polamalu got the inside push initially right here but then I think it's Larry Foote number 50 who comes around and really just sort of flails at the football and knocks it out you can see him almost backhanded out of there just got it right on the ball there his back turn just gonna throw his body back at it and out comes the ball so this was a very good team running the football a season ago Willis McGahee almost 1200 yards rushing but Polamalu disrupts a lot of things especially in the line in short yardage he had four thunders last year the state is amazingly with only 15 or season takeaways feuless in the league so they get it at the 47 now start with the Redman taking the ball to the 44 let's take a look at the Denver defense they're cool Cincinnati tie worn the real Texas A&amp;M Justin Bannon Colorado Elvis do McGill University of Louisville Paul Miller Texas and Joe Mays North Dakota State Wesley Woodyard Kentucky Champ Bailey University of Georgia Mike Adams Delaware Blue Hens righthanded anymore you see I left Tracy Porter Indiana Porter intercepted Manning in the Super Bowl a couple of years back and look at Champ Bailey you saw him introduce himself 14th year 11 Pro Bowls this is Chris Rainey her and the rookie gets taken down by Wesley Woodyard rainy is a working out of the University of Florida that'll set up a third down and nine Wesley Woodyard is getting a chance to play because DJ Williams is suspended he comes right out of this side over here and it chase it all the way across he's been there leading special teams tackler for a number of years around here and his speed certainly adds an element this looks better to me and they later after Dennis Allen that guided that unit last year ended up the hip coaching job with the Raiders play clock is down to one and the pass is caught and that will be Emmanuel Sanders for a first down so much groundandpound through the history of the Pittsburgh Steelers but right now of course with Antonio Brown and Mike Wallace and Emmanuel Sanders and the tight end Heath Miller they'd love to put it up well they've got his own blitz going and they're gonna try and bring somebody Mike Adams out across the way to get into that hook zone and he just couldn't get there he got caught up on the inside receiver Heath Miller couldn't get over the top and the Pittsburgh Steelers picked up a big first down the third down and nine now Redmond is back in the game from the 33 will be selling the running backs tonight stretch play went perfectly in a swarming defense von Miller number 58 is there and then Porter finishes him off for a loss of five it's so interesting Leonard both thought he had a good block on this one right here on von Miller he got him to the outside edge just let him go by inside but von Miller is just so incredibly quick and strong we were talking to John box he said I have never had one like this guy he said when he comes off the edge of course you got to deal with his speed all the time but then all of a sudden he rocks down and blows up tackles right back into the quarterback they really think they've got a superstar their oxygen Tripoli model devote so much of no around a school he was the second overall pick in the draft he had only Cam Newton to and second and 15 left guard and Redman going next no we're setting up a third down and long with a little over four minutes to play in the quarter so Jack Del Rio had been the coach of Jacksonville for nine years before that he was with John Fox at Carolinas an assistant helped him get the job with the Jaguars got fired last year then when Dennis Allen got the job and opened the cola not to Del Rio to come here and walk this burger has to slide away and it's out there rule they're looking at in Cincinnati they didn't have a first round pick he got pick in the second round he was their number one choice and he can walk it down his first sack ever Ben Roethlisberger in primetime they going to be happy with this with a little cross inside with the two tackles and Derek wolf who is as much a run player but when you watched him on tape coming out of the University of Cincinnati the thing that impressed you most was just how tenacious the guy was he never gave up on a play always hustling and they really needed some help inside Denver takes a timeout before a fourth down for Pittsburgh and you can enhance your viewing experience by going to NBC sports.com s and at extra for a lot of good stuff DVR controller social media analysis with Willie Parker avoid the night in that area as the Steelers inside the five and that is a beauty at the oneyard line down there find the markhest banned by Great Pond by the rookie from Georgia John Elway shirtandtie executive vice president football operations for the Broncos Pat Bowlen giving him the keys a couple of years back and very instrumental obviously in getting Manning here in those last two years for John 97 and 98 they won the Super Bowl he makes a lot of plays but on the oneyard line looking for breathing space fumble gave Pittsburgh the ball but they were only able to net two yards total to the three yard line remember gang he was a great star in college suffered a really gruesome injury in his last college game for the University of Miami nonetheless Buffalo picked him in the first round sat out that first year then three years with them went to Baltimore was their starting back for two years and then he backed up Ray Rice and then came here so here is Willis McGahee 10th year and at the University of Miami and still going very strong in his thirties secondly and again threading his way for a gain of a couple McGehee for two it will be third down and six welcome back Casey Hampton the big nose tackle he missed all a preseason and he is a guy that you just not gonna move him you know I was talking to him on the field before the game I said can you go to plays in a row because he hasn't had a lot of practice he said to plays is no problem I just hate running to the sideline of them now third and six Moreno flanking Manning in the backfield from the end zone and stepping into it and converts and Stokely breaks a tackle to the 21yard in responding ball down by Polamalu only Donald Driver is older than Brandon Stokley playing wide receiver in the NFL and you can just tell where Peyton Manning wants to go number four teens out there I'm backed up on my end zone he's going to break a tackle and pick up a first down and that is a big one to get him out of a hole getting away from Cortez at the first down anyway the ball is at the 22 yard line number formatting right there for six 444 final minute opening quarter fake handoff and then he with a flag down gets sacked by Jason walls so the fake inside handoff walls comes in off the edge and we'll see about the call here and of course it will be declined if it's against Denver these are for making that mistakes on Peyton Manning he was sliding his protection away his back came to this side they're all going this way but they came up one short and as a quarterback you have to know when you don't have that backside protected he just missed it that's something that Peyton Manning probably wouldn't miss in midseason maybe still shaken off a little rust eight yards sack Manning's gone down twice in the quarter second and 18 Moreno is the back three receivers set to the left side to go three by one they give it to Moreno he slips the tackle on the back but then can't get past the 16 yard line very foot would make the tackle in the backfield but they stopped him shortly thereafter and that's going to take us to the end of the quarter unless the Broncos and here they go the Broncos go to the line without a hundred get the play off incomplete Thomas was there the coverage was there as well the Bronco bench wants interference and the clock is stopped was five seconds with no flag and a fourth down and 17 and Peyton's saying that he was not off the field they took a quick snap one of the steelers was running off the field and peyton was pointing right in that direction saying he did not get off the field that should have been a free five yards for us but no flag and thus they try to catch the Steelers with too many men on the field don't get the call and now the carbon end after the punt here Antonio Brown from the forty gets a block on the outside returning the ball past midheel and that will be the end of the first quarter with no score in Denver Sunday Night Football back after these messages Oh sue aerial coverage tonight provided by Geico Rocky Mountain sunset John Elway went riding off into one of those following those backtoback Super Bowls announcing his retirement the height of his career at least in terms of start the second quarter Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya and and waffles burger will handed take the below to the 35yard let's go back to Manning trying to catch the steed of defense with an extra man on the field actually he did watch this action right over here you see Steve McClendon right there just jogging his way off the field he's right in front of one of the officials but the official had his back turn to Peyton Manning probably couldn't see the ball was snapped at that point so he couldn't make the call and just to clear it up in terms of the rules that was a challengeable play that they decide to challenge it but is still animated third down in 12 that will come along the 3071 and this is Jonathan Dwyer breaking tackles and Porter still can't get him down by the facemask and that's gonna cost them extra yardage on a great run by Dwyer third year back out of Georgia Tech sixth round pick in 2010 in this first carry of the season here unbelievable Justin ban and had him dead to rights and just couldn't hang on instead it's on Wallace looked like I might have gotten a face mask on the other end instead Wallace with the hold and negate the big game here alright Mike Wallace right up here that's a whole and the gates a heqco play here Justin Bannon at wire wrapped up in the backfield and just couldn't hold on and but I will say one thing about the Denver Broncos with some of the additions they've made now Derek Wolfe and tie Warren getting back and healthy Justin Bannon in there even Robert Ayers a good run player this team was horrendous a year ago against the run just left gaping holes for a middle linebacker Joe mazed and the trying to make play better on the spot that's going to make it second and five now out of the slide and the patch goes to the other side and that is caught by will Johnson Steelers this year using a fullback whose Aryans always used to tell us when he's the offenses were dating to go around town and people would scream at him get a fullback got a fullback but they were kind of lucky David Johnson was sort of their fullback tight in and this will Johnson was at a workout with somebody else that they were going to see ends up he's timed in the forties under four five and I go holy cow let's sign in and Mike Tomlin said a lot of people are going to take credit for well Johnson it was just from the 21yard as for the shooters in the outside the flag is thrown Heath Miller who does the same types of things for Pittsburgh that jason witten has done four years for the Dallas Cowboys solid steady consistent an offside call here Miller so then I think bond Miller is getting a little frustrated because the Pittsburgh Steelers are doing a little bit more of this quick passing game than what you've seen out of them in the past this is a new addition I think by Todd Haley he really wants to give his offensive linemen a few chances against these topmatch rushers to go out and just let them be aggressive so you don't have to block for three for five seconds and it slows them down because they get frustrated first out in five Roethlisberger is 3 for 3 in the was Jonathan Dwyer setting up second in short Bannon playing with his third team in three years makes the stop when Big Mac starts working on the outside that left tackle there was some question they drafted Mike Adams out of Ohio State whether or not he was going to be the left tackle but one of the reasons and they sort of felt like that starts was the better fit at least for now is Willie cologned a long time right tackle is now playing left guard in the half Mac starts in there and able to sort of coach Willie along for some of these early games might help him there's Mike Adams there right they drafted offensive linemen one and two the cast or the other but he's on injured reserve second down that can't pick up the first down his working Keith Brooking comes up to make the tackle in his 15th year working out of Georgia Tech the Pittsburgh Steelers the last few years have been so righthanded with their running game more often than not running off that way but now they feel like they can really pull both directions Ramon Foster a pretty good puller really cologne learning how to do that so there have a little more balance if you like out of the running game this down two and Roethlisberger asks for a time on eleven and a half to go in a scoreless first half that is season of The Voice and it begins tomorrow three nights of lying or difference beginning at 8:00 Eastern and Pacific and 7:00 central and mountain therefore the timeout at stirred down in to Chris Rainey the work Florida is the runningback English the 13yard and this is brown I picked up the first down in Tonio Brown to the 9 yard line Brown and a Central Michigan was a six round draft choice back in 2010 so he was really under the radar and then last year over a thousand yards receiving grew up in Miami and then with the North Carolina the prepschool return yardage over a thousand yards the Steelers named him their Most Valuable Player wire and Rainier now both in the backfield on 1st and goal this burgers over the middle Miller will take the ball to the two yard line Belair was only caught about 10,000 walls over the middle in his career second and goal there's a flag down the Steelers are looking to get up to the line of scrimmage without a huddle penalty marker the 10 another one of those quick throws and one of the things that they really have been working on early down throws to their tight ends and their backs they felt like they were too focused on their wide receivers a season ago they're trying to make that change before the ball was snapped and cokes 199 on the defense and the Frog replay first down that is bickerson right here and once you make contact we know that he made contact before that ball was snapped but either way it came out about the same way they just saved it down saved it down would have picked up a little extra yardage on the play but you'd rather have it first and goal from the three and second and goal from the two and it's deflected an incomplete tried to get it the ground on a slant that's Champ Bailey sand up on Machamp is seen more than a few of these you don't go to 11 straight pool balls unless you can break in on the goal line you know that's just outstanding the guy who's remarkable and I think what I've admired about Champ Bailey over the years yes he's tremendous playing the pass but that guy will hit you he plays the edge he'll make tackles he deserves his trip to the Hall of Fame when he gets in one day the biggest one trades in all of sports history Clinton Portis and Bailey Washington the Denver Court is now retired and Bailey still tickin second and goal Pass is outofbounds Miller able to haul it in but he was out of bounds covered by the linebacker Brookings whether he comes off put a great play by Ben Roethlisberger what's Tracy Porter the corner jumped this thing I thought it's going to be a pick six and then they had the discipline on the back end of that to still make the play keep working the old veteran smart enough to stay with him looking at flanks Roethlisberger in the backfield play clock column all the way down and you should have a delay here play clock at zero before the snap even signal to the team and guarded third and only come back they gave Roethlisberger a timeout but it should have been delay of the game you take a look at this there's there's a clock twoonezero he calls the timeout the bags artillery signaled way again but the referee said then got it off on time got the timeout for he didn't shoot him in the lines pass is deflected an incomplete knocked away by Tracy border the New Orleans intended for heat Miller and they'll have to settle for a field goal attempt the bad throw by Ben Roethlisberger should have been a walk in touchdown Heath Miller is going to swing out wide they're gonna blow the coverage completely drop Heath Miller all you had to do is lob it over the top easy touchdown LaShawn season third season of the students the guy's been the league for eight years Butler the hold it when twine to snap it and the first points of the game belong to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the player yard field goal set tend to go on the hand 3nothing Pittsburgh and his work back Sports Authority Field at Mile High and ready for the kickoff here is Shawn sweet sir we'll send this one Ashley enjoy when the yard line take a break here back 3nothing pittsburgh notable quarterbacks first start new team Johnny Unitas it looks so weird in a San Diego uniform and he didn't play well then Joe Namath went to the LA Rams and even play well that day either Joe Montana went from San Francisco to Kansas City and did play well over two years and the brett farr went to the Jets from Green Bay and then on to Minnesota at a decent start and here we go with Manning's who tonight is four out of seven as is raucous burger so look at that you've got identical statistics for the two starting quarterbacks at this point three nothing Steelers on top we're Manning to the 20yard line that's a sixyard game is joel Driessen makes the cash in one of the things with Manning and with Peyton is he want to go no huddle or not here he does he said in Indianapolis by the end though it got to be more of a muddle than a no huddle now they definitely want to pick up the pace and this no huddle of maybe trying to wear the Steelers down again it was a good idea altitude heroes McGee he takes him out to the 29 yard line and I remember playing here on opening day one time he's one o'clock in the afternoon probably wasn't any warmer than it is out here tonight I was so exhausted by the end of the game I've come lying down on the field just trying to catch my breath out there it is definitely a factor yeah but you still caught 10 passes that day third and that's caught for a first time Demaryius Thomas makes the catch Larry Foote making the tackle last time these two teams got together Denarius Thomas was run into the house with that overtime eighty yarder to send the Broncos on in the playoffs and so far today the Pittsburgh Steelers were more conservative on the back end than what they were against Tim Tebow in that past autonomous is able to reach back and make the catch and then jaws with Pike's wagon Taylor I'd slag and Taylor remember he was the one that Thomas beat last year and they have been pushin and shovin and John and fightin all night long on the outside the guide tailors heard enough about that plate or I have to go in the half Mowrey foot making the tackle on Tammy is former Indianapolis teammate v you know we got a Kentucky and the other thing this does and we talk about it all the time but you trap defensive linemen on the field in this day and age they're not used to having to play seven eight nine plays in a row and all of a sudden the pass rush starts to disappear second and six the 41yard line off the play fake Manon has to run away does and pain out of bounds with the first down I ran by Timmons got away from Lawrence and moved the chains one of the things that Dick LeBeau said that bugs them more than anything else about Peyton Manning are those little steps those little moves like Tom Brady makes inside the pocket well that time Peyton Manning saw Lawrence Timmons coming inside and he made a big move to the outside from the 34yard line Manning's going to get it away and the past is gonna be dropped intended from the goethe but it was Larry Foote who had him and he was able to get it away before he was in the grass second down it's starting to come with some pretty clever blitzes now taking the tackles down inside looping the linebackers around and you know even for a veteran guy like Peyton Manning Dick LeBeau is going to Surprise them from time to time there is is 75 years old today about the 75 year old Dick LeBeau the pass is caught Decker makes the catch and that's a first time saving tackle by Keenan Lewis but it will be third down and worden now they're trying to bring some pressure on the fly now that time LeBeau called a blitz coming off Peyton Manning's left side he just took a little step off to the right we found Decker this is an impressive Drive this is a Peyton starting at the 20 and inside handoff it's McGehee so they have gone from their 20 to the Pittsburgh 21st now now we've seen this one before a little Indianapolis Colts trap that they used to run all the time a definite blending of peyton manning's offense from indianapolis and what they do here although hard on the drive this would be the tenth play of the drive and Kuwaiti offensive coordinator calling in the plays to manage his paw and forward progress might net the first down for Tammy little juggle but right there we'll see where they spotted they only give him the 11 yard line pressure put on Manning that time he's a little short of the first down second and one Hayden threw that ball way before Tammy came out of his break it was just and he actually took a little off of that throw because he threw it so early run it to the six it is McGehee and it will be first down and goal Susan Brandon Stokley as his safety blocker over here sin wave him on he spelled the Blitz coming off the edge just to make sure he could get that handoff off at the ball almost five minutes play of the drive coming up from the six Moreno Knowshon Moreno trucks tank Denver how sweet was that right the in the arts 12 plays without a huddle just vintage wasn't it good it was like going back in time that traitor for the answer and the Denver Broncos get their first touchdown of the manager 5:16 left to the hand seven three Denver well one thing the Broncos talked about is getting paid and comfortable at the top of the game so they got them comfortable in the huddle but he's far more comfortable in the no huddle and there are the numbers sure lurk like that yeah 80 yards no huddle seven to three Sanders is back to receive the kick and bang crater with a big leg since seven yards in and Sanders is going to come out with it and get taken down at the 20 yard line by Omar Bolden Sunday night football brought to you by Papa John's the official pizza sponsor of the NFL buy taken to October 5th only in theaters by Toyota care complimentary on every news by the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 note the new way it's the Duke football named after the patriarch of the New York Giants Wallington merit for football the NFL around with changing it this year didn't titillation some synthetic laces in there in the receivers around the late says cut in my hands good for the 21 on first time inside your game for Isaac Redmond up to the 23 yard line it's kind of interesting ben roethlisberger a guy who comes in here and he idolized Joe Montana his big fan of the 49ers but he wears number seven because of John a lot of comparisons of his game for the way John oh man we also didn't uncle take it up to the 29 yard third and short Todd Haley is gonna love that play that is the one thing if he's been trying to change Ben Roethlisberger a little bit as he wants him going through his progressions in other words know where that check down is you don't always have to do some wild scramble if it is starting to break down just dump it down to the back five yards changing the cold before a deafening flan third and three keep it on the ground and swinging to the outside and getting the first down smart running is Redmond tackled by Woodyard they're actually doing a pretty good job of jamming it up inside watch how they Jam this hole up at the bounce out by Redmond so far in this game has been pretty good Jonathan Dwyer had one earlier so it's not that they're not doing their job they're just not able to get their hands on the ball Carrie threefifty into the hands laughs this burger was slip away extending the play as he's done a million times all he can do is throw it away when you're out of the pocket there's no grounding atoms chasing him down well bon Miller knows what everybody else knows now that it is tough to hang on to this big guy when he is doing his thing he ends up being able to grab around the shoulder pads and welcome to Jack Del Rio he said you got to treat him like he's a played in and uh oh and this mark is Gilbert the right tackle in pain there's Matthew Ferry he's here tonight he is a show that begins Tuesday on NBC schools go on he's a sports radio host with issues these a little help to go on sitting there wearing the Hat of the Los Angeles Kings he's a big Kings fan and the case you haven't heard crash the Kings won the Stanley Cup this you've mentioned it once or twice one of the odds that those two guys are going to stand up right in front of the promo Matthew Perry right you know it happens every time look mine too there's Gilbert who came off under his own power but he's Table Mike Adams not Ohio State a second down and 10 from the 33 yard line when they hand it off to parent batch with a flag with Mendenhall after living at Redmond Dwyer Rainey and batch as for running back supposed to fall back will Johnson and they've all seen action and there is Rashard Mendenhall still rehabbing off the knee injury which he suffered on the last day of the regular season sparingly suggest next week to the pass rush now a really good job and the catch is made by Antonio Brown who gets free for a big first down at the Denver 45 yard line 23 yards on a third and long Mike Adams is going to get some help over here from Heath Miller and that meant that max starts on the other side had to hold up one on one against Elvis do Merville and he did a fantastic job max Starks is what gave Ben Roethlisberger time to make that throw from the 44 well along the sideline no signal yet as to whether he did or did but he got a penalty back at the 50yard line two ticks before the twominute warning for making seven six with one in different properties fiveyard penalty that's the wookie Mike Adams who just came into the game Mike Adams knew he wasn't going to get any help that time Heath Miller released on the route so he tried to sneak an extra step off the ball right here and the replacement referee said not on my watch they're going to have to help Mike Adam so that puts a ton of pressure on Mac starts on the other side at all since the injury first and 15 here's ready he gets bounced down after a gain of three by Robert Ayers to MIT if one comes with 156 left in the half Denver seven Pittsburgh three on Sunday Night Football Robin Griffin the third against the Saints Washington wins lost scores on a pass from Sprint fortyniners lensed after the victory comebacks bob costas on the legacy of our aldo on the Toyota halftime show second and 11 now take the dryer and raucous burger wide open ground inside the 20 the band's at the 18yard line and that's what Ben Roethlisberger has done a million times extending that play the Antonio Brown fell down his defender turned around to look for Ben he still scrambling around you know how many times have we seen that I don't know it how did he even define that but that is what he does is a quarterback probably better than anybody just keeps plays alive and eventually the receivers uncovered on the 18 sixteen Silver's have one time I'm talking to the Antonio Brown yesterday and talking about when Roethlisberger extends to play we go what did he do he said well if I'm short I have a short pattern I go long if I go along I come back to him and what did Champ Bailey say said I hate it with a passion when he does it and you can have perfect coverage and still give up a touchdown secondly offered so veteran left tackle max Starks max start knows that he's not gonna have any help so he's gonna have to get off the ball quickly against Elvis do Merville provo pass rusher on the outside and it just changes your mindset so far he's been up to the task and really do Merville has not been a factor either his von miller much I begin 14 outside and incomplete off the hands of wire trails on the play by Woodyard third law we have seen a lot of these quick throws and I think due in large part now to the fact that Gilbert's out and they're having to play Mike Adams and they don't want to sit there and wait all day for the pass rushers to get in on the other side Mike Adams just by having outside gives him Simone thirteen the whites in brown over there with him walking down the middle throws caught at the 4yard line and he does it again Sanders makes the catch tackle there by Porter it'll be first and goal is get them up getting ready to clock it but you add the pump fake that Roethlisberger does to all the movement and by in time oh my a defendant first and goal at first we were talking about it and here it comes to fruition again Haley comes in as the coordinator and people say well how are these two guys going to get along will they change them when they go back to more of a ground attack and Ben says hey you know what I gotta be me and that's that's me right there and that's a whole lot of Ben but you see that pumpfake which just freezes defenders it's remarkable they can hold on to the ball I mean swings at that heart and they just pulls it down and throws the other direction second goal we fade is incomplete good coverage that time Wallace blanketed by Porter he will be third down in gold they tried Champ Bailey last time so this time Tracy or on the other side and you just wonder how many of these throws been and Mike Wallace have had he's only been there for a week but this is a major upgrade at the cornerback position to get Tracy Porter of course the Super Bowl hero picked off the pass against Peyton Manning to Saints but these two guys for the good pair right now thirty seconds for over the minute wide open miller for the touchdown Heath Miller as he is done so many times in his career just finds it open space right over the middle watch this little double move down in and then back out little fake Joe Mays jumps it free little clever there's another pump fake right there say what these guys go no huddle they're pretty good aren't they up and down the field we go that's a 79 yard drive 14 plays Sweden's extra point makes it a 10 to 7 Pittsburgh lead with 28 seconds left in the opening half on open a night Steelers on top ten seven what's your assessment over all these opening half here I think this is just pregame warmup right here you get the feeling these two quarterbacks are settling in a little bit right now and they're getting hot you know the no huddle seems to woken up both of these offenses it's been fun to watch the last ten minutes like a great heavyweight fight maybe a little feeling out process early on that's exactly right we will deliver the knockout blow a little opportunity to run that one back so let's see what Manning has in mind view with 28 seconds to timeouts we wouldn't imagine too much here would you against the number one ranked defense I don't know maybe take a little shot here Oh Leon you know if you could get an easy completion a screen a draw and you bust it out of there then maybe but I would say if Pittsburgh had all of its time absolutely a different story but you're right they're just gonna button it up right here take a knee and go to the locker room and that is the way the half ends maddening was 10 of 14 for 98 yards Roethlisberger was 9 of 16 for 120 at a touchdown Pittsburgh drew first blood Denver answered with that nohuddle be the yard attack and then Roethlisberger answered with 79 yards of his own coming up next meet on a halftime show with Bob Dan Ronde and these messages from your NBC station i T his first shock ever this burger in primetime that's shan't Bailey Santa that's just an outstanding how sweet was that and you can follow your favorite team all season long go to itunes.com slash NFL as we start the second half Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michele Tafoya opening night in Denver opening night of the Manning error 10 7 Steelers on top but Pittsburgh will get the ball as we start the third quarter that freighter descended down toward Chris Rainey and Roethlisberger we'll start from the 20 before that let's go to Michelle what would right tackle Marcus Gilbert questionable with a left knee working Mike Adams has stepped in Mike Tomlin told me to halftime that Adams did get some work in the preseason a right tackle he feels confident in him they're not going to give him any help on the line and by the way right guard Ramon Foster is also questionable because of an eye issue I asked Mike Tomlin if we'd see some more no huddle in the second half and he said you could see a heck of a lot more if it looks as good as it did on that scoring drive I'll bet Thank You Michelle here's Adams W gursky has gone over to right guard he's the backup center to Pouncy the drive begins at the 20 yard line with a blitz and the pass is a little under wires put on by the Denver defense second down in ten it's kind of interesting that we didn't see a lot of in that first half and granted there were too steep Safety's a lot of times for the Denver Broncos but Mike Wallace last year the wide receiver started the year eight for thirteen on deep balls was just a terror but they finished the season over eight trying to throw it deep and haven't hit one yet today or even five one down the field Ross also coming off playing at altitude his Dwyer runs into his own man and then is able to plunge the hit for gaming three will be third down and seven for the Steelers you know and one of the real positives for the Denver Broncos so far as they have pretty effectively shut down the running game of the Pittsburgh Steelers these big guys Derek Wolfe by Warren Justin ban and inside have done their job now they've got to get off the field on third and eight this is the moment for the secondary Pittsburgh is were so talk about what I'm saying the her we might seal Florida no homo you're seeing it right here single coverage on Wallace if he wants it and now you got something for off pinnacle still for down that'll make it third down and 12 now and this is what makes it really tough because now defensively you have a chance to bring a blitz then they get forced to throw one of those quick balls you know the hot throws and all that you make a tackle on third and eight you don't do that on third and 12 a lot of times that's what you see defensible sent for over the middle and the catch is made out of the 33 by Emanuel Sanders for a first now where Joe Mays has got to be saying what was that number 51 running right down the middle of field Emanuel Sanders it flips him around the tightest of windows and then is just having a tremendous game now you know why they abandoned the running game in years past the 33 to the ground to Dwyer and Dwyer not to the 39 if you take a look at Ben's for his head now they started with a lot of quick throws to try and slow down the pass rush when the Broncos were bringing some pressure just get it out of his hands and then we all know what came next some of the pump fakes and the scramble and the Ben being Ben and then there were the touchdown throws so that's what you get you slow down the pass rush with those quick runs and him a chance to do his thing second once again they picked it up he goes to Miller and Miller takes the ball for a first time to the Denver 47 yard line Eve Miller great read that time by Ben Roethlisberger blitz coming off to his right over here and they're gonna have to try and cover heath from inside out and they just can't get there that looks easy but when you're a quarterback to try and figure out exactly where that blitz is coming from and where that next defenders baby come from pretty tough nice play the drive of the second half sliding it's complete the first minimal gain if anything actually a losses Dwyer gets taken down let's call it no gain line of scrimmage Womack starts got beat on that one but he stayed with it just long enough and Ben was able to help him by escaping out to the outside here he is you're going to see the inside move put on by Robert Ayers almost gets there but then Ben has that little slide to help his tackle out again Mohan second down and seven seventh way of the drive coming here it's an action upfront and they you got a whistle before the snap he had movement with lagar ski and vickersontour neutral zone infection 99 defense fiveyard penalty second penalty on bickerson the second one and they're trying to get after this offensive line right now the Pittsburgh Steelers have no depth left whatsoever Doug larger skis in at right guard for a Ramon foster and of course Mike Adams in for Marcus Gilbert so that's it they only dress 7 they'd have to be a tight end if something were to happen from here there sits Gilbert on the Pittsburgh sideline second down and five two receivers to the left and three to Ben's right and he comes to the left side it's juggled it's taken by Redman and revin is able to get to the 40 yard line where he's tackled by Rahim more will make it third down and three and it's one of the problems not having Rashard Mendenhall in there when Mendenhall is coming out of the backfield with his speed some of those catches and runs can turn into 25yard plays not quite the same threat with Redman coming out can they injury making the trip hope to have him back the stealing's due next week third and three good protection that begins to break down that Ben's gonna pack it in he's gonna die and is going to come up a little bit short of the first down they're gonna spot it just inside the 38 yard line which is going to make it fourth down and each's now they may give him the bounce on this one let's see if he was touched at all before he goes down do you get the balance you should well there's contact there with the naked eye right now he's a little bit short of the first down then what if your Tomlin he was touched before he went down even though he was able to stumble ahead for a few yards and yeah but I don't think that put him down though I think he regained his balance after that no let's that's an official's call and take a look at this so he starts to lose his balance I don't think anybody touched we could read Mike Tomlin's lips he was saying let's go if you can challenge the spot of your table but I'm gonna see where they're gonna move it any closer to the 37 yard line so for the moment anyway they're going to line up to go for it more than a couple of inches Isaac Bradley one of the best in the NFL at this ban is going to keep it himself we'll see where they spotted Roethlisberger sliding to his left do Merville was there he only needed an inch or two and he's clearly got the first now where he put the ball down the crowd hates the spot his knees I didn't see you guys here to the ball I ever got to the young not sure either and again that's challengeable and should have gotten the balance on the prior one by fox and got a good one on this one from the 37 yard line tonight that's Cologne you know you wonder if Willie Cologne might be getting a little tired in this thin air here he hasn't played but one game and that was it right tackle and now he's asked to come over here at left guard and believe me I have know from firsthand experience this is a tough place on opening day easy to wear down first and 15 from the 41 through the middle Redman again going to that running game tonight again with Mendenhall out Redmon's been the main guy but he is carried the ball nine times for 17 yards so that's less than 2 yards per tote it's kind of interesting for me to watch Willie Cologne playing left guard pulling around on some of his power plays to work in progress for him second twelve and the sack Chris Paris flagged down comes in on the Blitz Anita I believe a false start against Pittsburgh by guards back right they should have a whistle before the snap is was one of the mouse to so the play was supposed to have been blown dead and it looked like a lot of the Steelers offensive linemen on the right hand side had sort of stopped on the play right like they had heard the whistle so that's a sometimes you get good penalties that was a good penalty if John Fox is trying to he figures the replacement refs much might decline and even though I can't the coin take a shot take a look at that since 516 was left in the first half Peyton Manning is napping on the sidelines for about 45 or 50 minutes County halftime even Troy Polamalu hair is dry now John doesn't look convinced doesn't know you know and after that two men had drive from paid Manning and the Broncos you're thinking oh boy the Steelers defense is worn down but they've been able to rest now counting halftime for probably 45 minutes second and 17 this drive has consumed only 37 yards and has taken almost seven minutes and the past is gone on a slant and Wallace gets a big chunk of those 17 before he's tackled by Porter that's going to make a third down and short it's a good read by Ben again they bring the Blitz off of that side which means that Mike Wallace had the inside slant to himself you can see the Blitz coming inside there from Raheem more been sought he's doing a beautiful job reading these but since tonight third down and four that's the quarter is over that's another first night as he goes back to Wallace again found the open spot walnut 223 first and ten you know Tracy Porter is gonna have to give him so much room he knows who Mike Wallace is one of the fastest receivers in the game and you know you just have to back off of him if they're willing to throw those little dinky underneath passes to Mike Wallace it's kind of hard to get up there it almost may invite him to come up place and bump and run now he's much closer here the 13th play of the drive this raucous burger coming in and it's incomplete for brown as Mike Adams got a hand in there he got an Adam's on each side of the field one for Pittsburgh and one for Denver and Adams the veteran safety came from Cleveland last year breaking it up boy just fractionally behind here but that's some play you thought maybe if he could have led them a little bit more but Ben took a pretty good shot just as he was releasing it got a lot on that throw he's played by Adams second down and 10 those press coverage and the students keep it on the ground as this is Dwyer taking it to the 16 yard line come on help lead the way pulling with a block and it's going to set up a key third down see here's what happens when you're worried about the speed you play your safeties back there so if you're Ben Roethlisberger you say okay fine I'll bring Big Willie coluan around run a little power play pick up about seven an injustice spectators almost an hour now third and three and Roethlisberger they get to him and the pass is incomplete von Miller came in and then knocks Ben to the grass and income suiza that side you get Elvis do Marvel here they tried to cut on that play there's a little bit a strange time to cut von Miller who probably doesn't weigh as much as Ben Roethlisberger was trying to get him down on the other side and that is 237 weekend's gotta buy a few here comes a 35yard field goal attempt by season and that one is good so they have the ball for almost nine minutes and finally get to see panic again 6:05 one for the third the Steelers are up by six Sunday night football being brought to you by DirecTV the seasons NFL Sunday Ticket is included when you switch my Nissan innovation for today innovation for tomorrow innovation that excites by frost brewed Coors Light the world's most refreshing beer and by the Samsung's Galaxy s3 the next big thing is here Denver Colorado Sunday night temperature today get up put the high 80s clear skies usual full house here James Harrison against not playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers missing head missing Florence five straight Pro Bowls Harrison coming back rehabbing his knee so they're fishing two valuable defenders and couple arm offense is well including seven into the enzone off the goalpost the minute or so and Manning will go back to work see it in September 20th at sunset Vista was the final stop of the PGA Tour playoffs for the FedEx Cup the Tour Championship coverage beginning September 20th on Golf Channel continuing on the 22nd on NBC McIlroy one today in Indiana he's on top Tiger is second Watney and Mickelson the top four now from the 20yard line peyton manning has not seen the football for 57 minutes and it takes the snack 29 yard line Eric Decker actually took one snap before the half but it was a kneel down so the last time he took a real snap almost an hour ago and Decker comes off limping in second in inches Matthew Willis comes in hundred career touchdowns from in this one Natan saw the Blitz coming it goes hot to that side they get blockers out in front and it is goodbye and Demaryius Thomas is a nightmare for this Pittsburgh Steelers defense he himself has made more big plays than the entire league did a season ago just beautifully called by Peyton Manning he saw it he took advantage of it about to go on so Manning doesn't see the ball for almost an hour and then in 36 seconds he gives Denver the lead again 14:13 Broncos very exclusive company the 400 club Dan Marino through his 400 at 37 years in a couple of months old farm a little before that he was not quite 37 and Manning 36 and a half roughly 616 days since his last touchdown pass fewest passes of anybody in the club's he figures to get Marino this year if he stays healthy and then we'll see about farmers over a hundred away but in 36 seconds and two plays he gives Denver the lead again and another touch back which means Roethlisberger starts again from is 20yard line when we come back to Denver on Sunday Night Football Ben Roethlisberger led a nine minute drive that culminated with a field goal has eluded the stove's on the defense Google mm 36 seconds so that Denver back on the field again traffic is incomplete intended for Antonio at the 50yard line Ronnie Moore was there with the coverage almost intercepted on that one coming all the way across the field you're going to see the safety Rahim more undercut this one and just miss it it's a heck of a play it's one thing they love about Raheem Morey at so much speed to the back end of their coverage second in town passes knocked down again this time it is crazy border on a pass intended for Emanuel Sanders it'll be third and ten to the Steelers the Tracy Porter is learning that just because you cover a guy for three or four seconds doesn't mean anything got away with a little grab there but I really had a great shot at a pick on that affects the Pittsburgh so has the ten from the 20 tosod blitz shut up front and the pass is dropped don't let the Hellmuth Sanders right there and here comes the flag he got whacked helmet the helmet unless the flag comes in no question about it and Tomlin comes out to check on Sanders raheem or helmettohelmet does it matter if it's not a those blowers up around my hammock you can see why the legs either one of them could have been her van automatic first down so you miss two interceptions that you have great shots for and then a helmet the helmet and all of a sudden the drive that would have bended is still alive so they're gonna March it off it's a 15yard penalty took it back to the 20 but it's pretty simple then those are the blows of the 20 improve it to the 35 crowd booing I think a lot of the flood was passing the fears that was cold it wasn't you have more experience in refereeing you're getting to looks like it at the 35 and dumps it in the traffic and that's Chris Rainey waiting to catch tackled by bickerson so Rainey seeing his first action ever to that obviously 5th round draft choice and at the University of Florida and a guy who can not only make make his mark out of the backfield with big plays but a great special teams performer and a guy who's a kick blocker supreme he ever gets in the open field you'll see a little man on any Jill Mays and Chris Harris I salute they famous by Terrell Davis now they're giving some pressure right over here with this Chris Harris blitz off the side in addition to what's happening up the middle of field Uggla gursky trying to hang on and where they really think highly at Joe Mays don't they eight are bad when he hits you you know you've been hit that was a big the toil of Mike Conlon's solar he'd seen with a pair of sacks tonight third eye the 27th throws and that's going to be a big first down ace Miller to the 50yard line so one and that he goes to that security blanket he's done it for years 23 yards out nut move and he is tearing up these linebackers this time it's Wesley Woodyard who've been on the fake there was no reason to bite on the fake if he had caught that out would have been no problem and Mack starts inside tight for his life they got it done let him catch the absolute he's eight or nine yards so forth instead now they give it to Dwyer goes and that's going to be a personal foul humor bill grabbed him by the facemask seven penalties tonight against Pittsburgh four against Denver and a number of others have been declined well the Broncos got away with a face mask on the prior drive against Ben Roethlisberger but this one's pretty easy to see and now you have to start to wonder is Denver's defense despite the fact that they live and work here starting to wear down just a little bit they've been out there forever especially so on opening day and as you can see the time of possession is 2 to 1 in favor of the Steelers Pittsburgh has run 54 plays and Denver is run only 32 personal foul will move the ball over 32 yard line and this will be the eighth play of this Drive so Pittsburgh in the staff has had the ball for 23 plays and Denver 2 that makes the catch it sucks running staying in bounds adding extra yardage and he might have a first down by getting to the 22 yard line leading rusher and preseason for the Pittsburgh Steelers you just get the feeling that Jonathan wire is desperate for the opportunity to get a chance to play Tracy Porter not known as a very good tackler showed you exactly why there would fight though that Jonathan Dwyer had turned the five or six yard game into an 11 word game and a first down reading back then is the running back middle and incomplete Jericho naturally first time he's been targeted tonight the intended receiver and benches I missed it it's on me second down yeah but then didn't take a shot that time because Isaac Redmond is going to save his quarterback off of that play fakes so many times those running backs don't see that Blitzer Redman a nice pickup there you don't get the completion but you save your quarterback a shot see when it's the play in the quarter to the ground again on second and one to the 19 yard line and really no semblance of a rushing attack the Dwyers had a couple of decent runs Redman 10 carries 21 yards hailey calling the play third and seven Jack they're real going the defense good protection and again it's pillar and again it's a huge third down conversion form to the 11yard line goes Heath Miller we're just running some little crossing routes over the middle and Heath Miller coming out of the wide side of that bunch formation helping on do Merville and then as the criss cross happens Heath Miller able to make the catch and pick up another first down good protection again four catches 50 yards from Willow tonight and Pittsburgh's only touchdown inside wire we'll break it to the outside and we'll leap in for the touchdown Mike Adams Dwyre takes it into the end zone and pittsburgh is back on top it's amazing how many times today that the Broncos have had this thing locked up inside and then the backs of the Steelers just bounce it out and around and there's nobody there to have the contain that time Mike Adams in position but Ben Roethlisberger Peyton man he started to look a little unstoppable now look at that knee the knee looks down this gets reviewed upstairs remember all scoring plays get review and when they see this this should come back so it's very clear that it's under review and it's going to wind up back at the two yardline so for the moment that purse still has the lead this won't be a touchdown it's going to be probably second and one at the when the crowd lets out a big cheer that's the good news the bad news is it's second down and one at the two yardline contact brings them down the down there fall at the two yardline and with 24 seconds now to go in the third quarter and they can they're gonna wine the quark so they don't have to run a play and then is that's exactly what they're talking about right now he's the play clock would go to 25 the game clocks at 24 you're gonna wind it here and Ben is basically saying I'm not gonna run it into this end zone I'm gonna take it all the way the other way so in the quarter the Broncos had the ball for 36 seconds we're going to go to the fourth quarter in Denver at the Bronco sir at the top a light moment between Roethlisberger Bailey 1413 Broncos Sunday Night Football resumes after this to look at downtown Denver from the sky being rough you by Geico fourth quarter begins now Michael's Chris Collins were at Michele Tafoya 1413 Denver on top but look at those statistics for the third quarter 36 seconds Denver's had the ball 27 plays to to the touchdown was just reversed but it's second down and from the two yardline as we start the final quarter Chris Rainey is the tailback they give it to the up pack who's read minute he gets stood up behind the line of scrimmage that's fun and that's going to make it third down on a couple like Adams got beat across his face on that one just couldn't quite get the inside gap right here tried to reach there and just was no way Devon bickerson got in there and made the play on retina third and two who's the back the pass goes to Loras for the touchdown and Wallis outside they had Miller going to the corner of the end zone and Pittsburgh does get its touchdown that was reversed on the call to take the lead again 1914 and Navigo for two what a throw by been back shoulder on a slant Tracy Porter could not have covered that any better it was just absolutely perfectly executed by Ben Roethlisberger that was the only spot he gets a completion on that one as I say go for two here to make it a sevenpoint lead Sanders flanks wide to the left three receivers set to the right is batter that's infant try to get it to pose for Justin fan and maybe done yeah tipped away to make it a fivepoint you this Sunday night football brought to you by Geico 15 minutes to save you 50% of the car insurance by tide and trusted by whole 32 NFL teams by Audi truth in engineering and by AT&amp;T the nation's largest 4G network a TMZ rethink possible in Denver now Pittsburgh up by five with 14 11 to go in the fourth his times were about an hour and 20 apart from the plays he was involved in one of which was open me go ahead touchdown at Sunday night to San Francisco we go Bertha's game of the week the Detroit Lions coming from behind the day Stafford leading that late drive to beat st. Louis against the 49ers who knocked off the Green Bay Packers and of course this is the renewal of the handshake in a manner of speaking sports Jim Harbaugh last year in Detroit can we all get along next Sunday night throw the shotgun on first down who those minister baby for a gate of nain think about the NFL today I mean just look the wild endings all over the place Philadelphia over Cleveland Detroit over st. Louis 49ers knocking off Green Bay it never ceases Minnesota somehow wrangling one from Jacksonville are you predicting something here another great one the game forty yard line on the second and one he gets 11 yards in the first now when Troy Polamalu is playing the deep free safety I think that Peyton Manning feels a little more secure in calling some of these run plays so you don't get that xfactor down around the line of scrimmage now it looks like they're gonna flipflop back there they'll bring Palmolive back down in the action the outside here's Thomas Taylor misses him with an arm tackle at the 50yard line remember the stiff arm that Marius Thomas put on Ike Taylor for the gamewinner and over time this guy is six foot three 235 pounds even Troy coho and a little trouble wrestling down the chains again is Knowshon Moreno takes it to the 48 yard line again you see Troy Polamalu playing back here deep and so Payton deciding that's a good time they are together as an offensive player more he is 15 yards away from the ball and half your eye Decker Minnesota 43yard Lonnie was their leading receiver last year of course a team that loved to run with Tebow at quarterback second and four Manning not letting the defense rest for the 31 at a first down any questions you have about Peyton Manning's arm you can just put them in your hip pocket now watch this throat all the way across the field for hash drops it in their view and he has not been stopped since this is this is been near perfection 52:19 on the night 206 yards it's he's a little high and took Eric Decker Louis on the coverage there there was definitely a little pushing and shoving but say I thought that is a pretty good nocall least the first glance let it look at second guns then soft second at 10:00 to the outside and that is caught and getting up and trying to get the first down his Jacob Tamme man he does so Tammy was about a yard Shawn was able to get up and pick up two extra yards to move to change wellpaid man he didn't even step into that throw his feet were pointed up the field he sort of did to sidearm slingshot and Jacob Tamme yes remember his old pal from Indianapolis it's his receiver at the five and this is Decker taking the ball to the one and he's down there the play was whistled dead at the oneyard line for a first and goal and manic says that's keeping up let's not let him change yeah I'm not sure he was down on this play let's take a look close the Manning wants to get the play off before there's any possibility of a challenge wines up as a no touchdown call just short of the goal line he saw what Manning was doing Tomlin wanted a challenge there's the flag but once a play was run the next play was run you cannot challenge it he can't go back and time one's going to try to say that he wanted the challenge before him now you're gonna have a real brouhaha here when was the flat what was the challenge flag thrown here it comes there it goes just at about the time the ball was snapped and did any officials see it wouldn't matter his day was down right anyway it's not going to matter except for the fact that it would cost Pittsburgh a timeout right which may matter and a challenge he reached let's burn and of course you hear the the Broncos all saying they ran to play well in any event the place that's gonna stand at the oneyard line we come back after all this puzzle ride we think Tomlin talked himself into a challenge but this is still not going to come up Pittsburgh's way after all this it's going to cost them a timeout and one of their two challenges because Decker's knee is down as he has possession of the ball and the way we see it the spot the ball at the oneyard line first and goal yeah and they get first down back because they didn't score the touchdown so it would have been second down so there's really no positive that comes out of this for Pittsburgh here comes the flag remember here comes you'll see the flag coming in there was the snap simultaneous the official has to see the flag before the snap now there is the possibility that another official not the referee saw the flag before the snap and then they get together and say yes I did see him throw the flag first Oh here comes the door you ruling on the field is confirmed apply now first down on the oneyard line so it all turns out in Denver's favor and John Fox of course who was livid saying how can he make that call after the fact lines up is the beneficiary in every way and now because Pittsburgh went for the twopoint conversion on the other end if the Broncos score a touchdown they'll go for two and try and stretch this thing to three so a lot of giveandtake here good stuff 9:34 remaining and regulation this is a four and a half minute drive have started back at the 20 after a touchback three rushes and five pass plays on his ride man he's gonna set up initially in the gun with McGehee right there the first things first when the Steelers have really sort of shown they're going to play bump and run man coverage and Payton had time to go walk out and say something to his wideout touchdown Jacob Tamme is 14:8 let's see if he controls this ball going to the ground is it over the line of scrimmage and he's down I think he does control it all the way right there over the plane bottom hits the ground and that looks like a touchdown but the presnap was interesting Peyton Manning was standing at the line of scrimmage and the defense was already set for Pittsburgh I think he came out and changed the play he saw the bump and run mantoman ran the pick play over here and got the touchdown all of his Royals from Indianapolis really silly going for two to try to make it a threepoint Dean is caught for the conversion McGehee broke the plane on brings them back again 923 left while opening night in damper inside to play fantasy football go to nfl.com slash fantasy and sign up on this Sunday night back and forth we go Denver with a lead by three and later just one behind your Rainey thought about it wanted to do it was told him up to back to the touchdown we go now they were all sitting around waiting for the referee to signal the ball ready but the defense it set itself the offense did so Payton said look we're gonna run the little pick play over here he changed the play before the referee even signaled the ball ready for play now you can see the referee come in but the look he got was good enough so he does the sprint out that way easy touchdown they taking advantage of every opportunity including a slow mark of the ball is the one event costume back the other way and rainy turns it into a sevenyard gain as it begins this drive by taking it to the 27 yard line it'll be second down and three that was a deliberate play marques Pouncy the center started to his right and then is going to circle back around this way they're going to try and take advantage of Chris reigning speed to the outside picked up seven inside nine minutes deploy going deep welcome Tracy Porter with Mike Wallace down the sideline it will be third down and three one of the rare times down that they come with a single safety this is straight oneonone coverage and Tracy Porter just learned whatever it was they were paying him that's one of the toughest assignments in the NFL and he played that beautiful they notice on the Saints 33 the Bailey on laws this time to the right side as well they're doing the coverage and then slings it over the middle of it is broken up by Tracy for room is by blowing the coverage it's fourth down they mix up over here and they don't cover Mike Wallace running down the middle of the field they've got him for a touchdown VIN never saw it they messed up the switch off had to freebie and just missed it this is Jim Leonard bringing it back up to the 38 yard line so dental with a three point lead and the football they they seem to go well on Tuesday night a new kind of family with the same old issues comes to NBC check out the new normal tomorrow after the voice and the series premiere Tuesday night right here on NBC how do they do that that's great the future Olympians over there back we covered the 37 and since we seem to see what Denver's going to do on this Drive in terms of huddle or no here's McGehee they've had so much success tonight running typical Manning nohuddle all of their scoring coming off of that but now at this particular point you want to begin to use the clock so maybe it's like it used to be in Indianapolis then go up to the line but in a lot of a lot of the play clock expired second in five the third and two is McGee he gets taken down by Timmons up at the 45 yard line it's kind of interesting to me and I know it hasn't been every time but it seems like every time Troy Polamalu has been back Peyton Manning has checked to a run he's back again 32 and now they hand the ball off and it's going to be a first now of the shoot coming loose by Moreno Knowshon Moreno the backup loses his shoe but picks up the first down to the 48 yard line and Lance ball number three back now comes in thanking Manning in the gun took him down to seven minutes for with a beak hole through the middle it's been a result in a first down contingent on the spot is Alan and Pola Malo make the tackle they just lose that xfactor the move of field and he plays like a linebacker he slices through he's where you don't expect him to be and now he's making tackles ten yards from the line of scrimmage now he's coming up from the 41 yard line so he throws it off to the right side away from Paul Thomasson to take care of what in case she does handle of going again Lance ball fourth year back out of Maryland ran for over 400 yards last year in reserve role Alama give you your analyst hat that's exactly what happened Polamalu was showing blitz so tomorrow's Thomas comes down said that he can't he's gonna come shuffling down here to make sure Polamalu doesn't get there second down and eight McGahee slinging it to the outside and getting free for a first Alice Jacob Tamme to the 20yard line well you just can't beat him you come up and bump and run he's going to check to the pig play come down this time hit the wheel up the sideline to Jacob Tamme just no way for Cortez Allen to stay with it he knew exactly where it was he just looked off the safety and bingo now with the 20 on first down five and complete passes tonight no changes sling into the outside and getting back to the line of scrimmage is McGehee as he takes you to the 20yard line ticking down to five minutes to play in regulation I don't know how Peyton's next to him but his brains doing fine yes he is pick this defense apart now he comes under Center on second down in time yes day I think it is in the field now they're gonna switch back and use a lot of time off the playground with the game clock right the city wants to do perfectly perfectly executed these to that point and in this point as well as the day he was some tough running takes it to the 11yard line to make it third down and one tackle there by worlds with four and a half to play pretty nice job on the outside I think that was Eric Decker that came down and sealed it and he put on the tape of these Denver Broncos he's right out Splott third down Pullum Oliver's running running right for the Center for one of those dive over kind of plays paetynn Songza backed out of there too smart for that here he comes he goes yep big pleco nothing he takes the time out of here with 3:56 has he really been away a year doesn't seem like it Nate Manning was under center and he was watching number 43 almost exclusively on that one his poem oh here you see him coming down here bopping and painting said I'll hold on hold on and then pull him out of sight he's gonna back off now he's gonna come over from this side he didn't like that one either third down and two he'll go not enough here you don't want Ben to be able to win with a touchdown going the other way 355 each seen two timeouts thirteen stole them all over again and Tammy comes inside to take care of that and he ever whistle before the snap I think that it delay lay a teen offense fiveyard penalty Goku bad that hurts off a timeout but it was the idea that Jacob Tamme was going to have to come down and handle Tori Paulo Malo here we go right here he's coming down to help clock goes to zero good call by the officials so fulla mono even though he hasn't made a play they haven't snapped the ball that makes a third down and seven they pick it up in the passes with a flag clone incomplete intended for Decker Keenan Lewis with him stride for stride Eric Decker made just enough people move back to the ball get this call every time as a receiver if you show an effort to go back to the ball watch at the top of your screen there the hands on he tried to get back the official determined then he had enough of a push and a little grab and that is a humongous column in top close call too late push force control stand up McGahee as it takes along through the seven yard line now the Steelers have to begin to think about taking a timeout but more importantly they've got to stop him here and hold on to a field goal that's what it amounts to and there a timeout as we go toward the end of this game because of that challenge that didn't work earlier second goal to stokely in the back of the endzone covered well setting up a third and goal they tries to go to Stokely there and you've got to think anytime we've gotten the oneonone situations it's been Stokely he's been looking for if the Bowen is sorry fifth birthday look like nothing here stoking slot left chalice wide left Decker wide the good shot for tomorrow back of the day long Eva's own read now for free sign he goes and that's incomplete trying to work the back solder of Eric Deckard Lewis covering on the play and they will have to settle for a field goal and it would still be a one possession game boy both of these Keenan Lewis doing everything he can to fight for it no call there no way and that is the correct call just two guys battling for the football and that is huge defensively because now Ben Roethlisberger will have a chance of winning that traitor for a 26yard field goal and we'll make the store 25 to 19 with exactly three minutes to go well we've had a lot of stuff tonight obviously with Manning looking like Manning on his way back and a lot of credit go to the Pittsburgh Steelers obviously you're playing the game without Ryan Clark you playing the game without James Harrison's you're playing a game without Rashard Mendenhall you playing the game with your offensive line is banged up and mixing and mastering pretty good yeah it is and you know Peyton Manning is almost a bit of a miracle he's here for procedures on his neck he says he begged doctors to tell him you can't play anymore you're in more danger than what you would have been otherwise and yet he said none of them ever said that to me so I'm playing maybe back to when he was with Indy throwing that thing just under 50 miles an hour tonight say time to throw maybe a couple of miles an hour off the fastball but I think they can live with it here in the Mile High City when to a slider and he said you know every day I go to rehab so I understand I'm still a work in progress at this point I have not a finished product but the product looked pretty sharp tonight I don't think Manning is the kind of guy who would ever say he was a finished brother pretty good point yeah pretty good for always learning always something new nobody works arteries in coach nine yards in Wakeeney Rainey wants to come out at the NFL right trying to come out of my store the track yeah his foot was actually on the back line couldn't have brought it out anyway he was looking for a Cromartie run Cairo pretty close yeah little half step here we go you can't ask for anything more than this you got a chance to see one of these in Super Bowl once they against Arizona Haley saw two at a time three minutes we've got two timeouts and the twominute warning and a low snap forward throws which Brown and once again been turning junk into a jewel first down and it's just remarkable that he can take a snap off the ground pick it up find the coverage find the receivers and make this kind of throw it's remarkable and we have an injured Bronco and a little helmettohelmet hit but at that point I don't believe he's defenseless now he's sort of in a running position and so I think that's a good nocall dare his Chris Harris who is down on the ground but up now sitting up flexing sysm okay and of course has to come out for at least one ploy and he is there nickel guy so that does in this sort of two minutes situation if he can't go back in they take the next step down the ladder where there is so much speed on the field for the Pittsburgh Steelers these receivers so talented Wallace so it's only Carter coming calluses spawn Jim Leonard is also in the game the veterans safety first in 10 from the 39 yard line and for that one is complete in the direction of Sanders and they went right for Tony Carter's man at that point second out of 10 the ball fly out of his hand with that pump frayed I mean it really just looks like as a defensive player this looks like a pass not that yeah there's one little pump here comes a big pump it's amazing his hand is humongous Viserys comes back in the game just for the lung play sucking down a 10 daily playing press coverage on Wallace not letting him get the release at the bend looks that way Tracey Poirier where we seen that before got the shoot the dancing with a pic of Manning walk this one up with a pic of Roethlisberger what a game for Tracy Porter tonight little inside release didn't like it arrows back outside you can see Porter looking back at Roethlisberger and there he goes and somewhere peyton manning is saying see ben got me too I'm going to go for two here why do you want to make it 14 it's 12 right now man exam we're gonna put the ball down going to go for two and for a 43yard return and boy let the expectations go up in Denver they were skyhigh anyway but after beating the Pittsburgh Steelers going to be a lot of Super Bowl talk around there takes us to the twominute warning with 158 left the opening night in Denver 31:19 we're back for the conversion here the officials mistakenly call for the twominute warning even though the clock is 158 you had a scoring play which of course gets reviewed there was no question about whether it was a touchdown or not but you have to do the conversion before the twominute warning even at 158 so a blown call 106 Lee so here's your twopoint conversion with McGehee in the backfield landing sending those three stats tomorrow he's going to come in but they keep it on the ground and they keep McGehee out of the end zone that's Larry foot so they've already taken the twominute warning and we have 158 to play coming up after the game it's the Wendy's postgame report Michelle will interview the stars of the game and then Bob Tony and Michael break it all down and Chris and I will take a look ahead to a very intriguing matchup at Candlestick next week with Detroit going to San Francisco well ben roethlisberger you're going to be able to see he's going to look to his left and get a good you there was no doubt in his mind what was going on he saw Tracy Porter there and just tried to squeeze one end that he really didn't have to do but you can't say he threw it blindly put staring right at it the whole time just thought that he could thread it in there and obviously big mistakes so Pittsburgh needing two touchdowns down by 12 but what a difference Tracy Porter face you have Champ Bailey on your team so the other guys going to get a lot of throws over that way and Tracy word and I making them think maybe you ought to throw back over to Champ Bailey side Bailey telling this the other day he said I call my defensive line and look stop the run we will take care of the pass trust me pretty good job not complete stoppage of the run but a much better job by the Broncos defensive front seven than what we saw a season ago well the Steelers are averaging less than three yards per rush tonight and that'll win you a lot of ballgames you hear the defense I'll tell you though you got to give some credit to the offensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers the pressure really has not been a major factor elvis de Merville von miller they've not gotten there and this is a bangedup line that played with their final five guys available for much of the day on a winding with five and they're gonna get cold and spinning man speaking the Von Miller for reals well they put the tight in that way but Mike Adams under estimating the quickness of von Miller off the edge and just couldn't get there Miller ducks underneath and finally gets to Ben Roethlisberger's so second down 15 Sanders makes attached it'll be third down in about five from the 25yard line and it's 15 left in reg Atlanta for their next game that's Monday Jetts go into Pittsburgh under a minute now then is going to go down at the 15 yard line with villages been a tea Bowl bringing everybody off the edge he's going to go back inside and get the sack dug litter ski kind of got lost on that one we get a Tebow out of this one oh we do a little tribute to the guide of leather playoff game over Pittsburgh last year though we've hit the milehigh solute in a Tebow tonight now what was the stat though that Tim Tebow was the first quarterback to ever win a playoff game in his first or second year and then move to another team right but he completed only ten passes last year in that game for over 300 yards here are the numbers tonight these guys going to touch downs but Roethlisberger throwing that huge interception the pretty much salt sit away how about Peyton Manning coming back after almost two years of against the number one ranked defense and put up a 120 yeah do that and looking for all the world like Peyton Manning soon as they let it go let it start billing and they gonna wrap them up not with another set this is what so three cents pittsburgh's right where Denver will do it and John Fox will have a big opening night wind Wesley Woodyard was just sort of spying Ben Roethlisberger here regarde ends up with a sack well it's just hard to put into words what peyton manning must be feeling after all the rehab procedures on his neck after a lot of people wondering whether or not he should retire what else did he have he had the Super Bowl ring he had the four MVPs but it wasn't enough Elway telling me that Peyton Manning first got here he was two days after getting released by the Indianapolis Colts and he was so stunned that he couldn't even talk to him yet about coming to the Broncos that he just emotionally wasn't at that point but boy what a job Elway did to sell him have to run with one more snap it's like going to a new school hey mom hate that pedicle these new friends and a little nervous those popular kid in class right now water performs I answered a lot of questions tonight I know with the rest of the years in the break people wondering was he healthy could he do it that he looked the same what's going on what if he takes a hit all this stuff not for one minute anyway always in his new environment and the shell is going to talk to him on our postgame show he's congratulated by his opposite number Todd Haley tonight all these postgame report coming up next is Denver wenches 31:19 over Pittsburgh back after these nose
