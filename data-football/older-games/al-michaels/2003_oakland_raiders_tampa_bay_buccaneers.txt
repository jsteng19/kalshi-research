============================================================

so we are finally ready now the much anticipated matchup between the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl 37 the guys have been out on the field John for about 25 minutes to begin with you know and I think both these coaches know that and both the teams know it I know I was talking to some of the coaches on the field before and the thing that they thought both their teams don't pull your switch too soon don't come out here like an hour ago all fired up because they know that they were going to have to go through this I think they've planned for it and they're ready for Sebastian Janikowski was their number one draft choice the Raiders picking a kicker number one in 2000 back deep Aaron sticker and he'll be joined by Dwight Smith it's obligatory of course every time you do a Tampa Bay Buccaneer game to say never in the history of the franchise which started in 76 as this team returned they kickoff for a touchdown Jon Gruden saying yesterday the you we've erased a lot of those things we've never done before the cold weather the playoff and maybe this is another one the ball in the air the ship they're on this beautiful Sunday snicker takes the kick and brings it back to the 26 yard line so here they go as they bunch to the ripens an allstar in motion and after a gain of three Charles Woodson makes the tackle and Brad Johnson who's been in the league since he was drafted by the Vikings in 92 John as it was the case last week they're going without a huddle on the opening drive that's the thing that Jon Gruden wants you're Brad Johnson likes to play like this is what they want to do is and change the pace of the game this is the first study player borlaug to Pittman through the middle for a gain of 1 to the 31 yard line so Gruden going to the nohuddle if either team would have gone no huddle we would have said Oakland because they do it a lot they dictated the pace last week against Tennessee but Groody who's on the mic he calls the plays indirectly to Johnson goes to it at the outset now he has a puddle again you know last week they did the same thing in fact both of these teams started the game with no hotter third down and five now from the 31yard Gerald Vicious in motion and Johnson looking left and locking it to the right and it's picked off by Charles Woodson an easy pick and Woodson sets opened up in Tampa Bay territory and this was a big thing we talked about Brad Johnson if he gets time Brad Johnson is not a mobile quarterback so he's going to be a sitting target there and you're going to see breaking up Shaw is going to get Brad Johnson just as he throws a ball watch Reagan up shore right here you see he takes it inside move then he gets a push and he hits Brad Johnson Brad Johnson was a cover two and he didn't get anything on it he said he throws it a little short and Charles Woodson was right there and Charles Woodson playing with a pleat in his leg who missed a lot of time during the regular season and a guy they figured a pick on pick only the regular year so the intersection the Raiders in good shape right off the bat at the 35 is line open and 125 is taken down by the other tackle there by Brian Kelly now the Raiders last week opened up in no huddle but Rich Gannon the league MVP saying let's huddle up right here I think it's the same thing and you know that they like to control the pace and as Bill Callahan says he said we'll go in and out of that any time that we feel that we're on a roll we're going to stay with it stay with that roll second and two at least in the next 20 minutes or so the Raiders on the sunny side of the field so one of the coaches will have to shave as Ganon fakes right and it throws incomplete over the middle and it'll be third down third and two and then Ganon looking over to the sidelines Ganon will look over to the sidelines a lot he will signal to the bench a lot he wants to know what personnel grouping am I going to get what play am I going to get and he likes it with alacrity right he likes Marc Trestman to get the personnel to him right away so we can get that called and then get the play to her quickly so he can get up to the line of scrimmage one more time from the 28th on third and to Dan to brown and that's a first down at the 20yard line like Smith makes the tackle the Nickelback and he'll play most of the game today and that's that's because the the Raiders are playing three wide receivers so the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are playing a nickel Ronde Barber the right corner goes in and he plays on the slot and Dwight Smith is a corner that plays on the right side and let's decide that they're going to look through the three wide receivers from the lantern yard line to the ground level to gone there and let's take a look quickly at the radar offense second down in line now at the 18 yard line caught by the defensive end Greg spires third down and seven but thanks enough as Simeon rice comes into second now I'm to play before that it was Greg spires equip the pressure on Rich Gannon this time here at Simeon rice on Barry Simms and you're going to see him he'll beat them to the inside now you're always great about that speed guy going to the outside see so he starts outside Simms steps outside and then Simeon rice comes right inside and he's right on the jam now a 40yard attempt by Janikowski Shane lek ler to hold and Janikowski scores the first points of Super Bowl 37 the Buc canoes that was a heck of a stand down and and veer speed showed when Gannon tried to run and then of course the Raven got the big cash flow caste second kickoff for today it's Aaron stepping past and the backup running back puts the bowl down on the ground at the 30yard line and I'm looking to see if there's any indication yet that it was down it's Eric Johnson who comes up with it and there has been no signal yet from Bill Corolla or his crew as to whether his knee was down and now they're going to say it's a fumble and it wasn't and for the moment anyway pending a look at the replay and a possible challenge obviously it would be Oakland ball here it is Ciaran Stecker goes down his knee was down before the ball came out in fact he's trying to extend it you see the knee is down and the ball doesn't come out until he hits it with the ground or he hits the ground with it see the knee is down right there and right there the ball is down so this is one of those plays that they call Raiders ball but they will give this one back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers no question on a clearcut call they're going to look at it the only downside here for Tampa Bay Tampa I'll tell you the second rolling on the field that was a fumble we'll reveal the plate see one of the things I think they're a little agonized about is you only get two challenges for the entire game and so you're forced in a situation where you know they're going to overturn it and clearly it's important and you have to do it but now you're forced to use one of those challenges yeah but at least in using challenge if you win the challenge what they will you get the ball baton I mean if you if you didn't challenge then then they gave this ball to the Raiders they said it was a fumble and it was a Raiders ball but you can see steckler's knee was down well before that ball hit the ground I would think on the Tampa Bay so did some consternation that since this is so obvious that they'd be a little miffed that the official didn't get it right at first yeah and right that's the thing that goes back to this same thing of allstar officials and I think you know all year they worked as crews and then when we get in the playoffs the championship the Super Bowl they take the officials that graded the bet in other words built throws our referee he was the referee that graded the best all year and these guys grade the best all year as individuals but have never worked as a team or a crew and I think that's a mistake and I I would bet in the next year so that will be changed after we're hearing the play as we determine that the runner is down by contact camp available Christian Kane Tampa Bay is not charged a timeout I think you're here inspector was saying the same thing that you were saying helpful honey you should you should have called it that way in the first place absolutely and all of the Bucs were angry when they came off the field as if to say you know what that's it's an easy call and it might not matter but then again you only have one more challenge the rest of the way and that's why instant replay was initially put in to right or wrong there was a wrong and then it was righted from the 29 now the Bucs second possession beginning Johnson that pace is caught by Jojo a fish's out to the 40yard line he's taken down by the middle linebacker the rookie out of Northwestern Napoleon Harris it was interesting we're talking to Chuck Bresnahan the other day and talking about the wide receivers of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers I think he was as worried about Joe garages as any other receivers he made the big play last week to 71 receptions only can't even slow it up here that's 11 yards of first down and with no huddle here and an empty backfield the pass is juggled and then dropped by Pittman and almost into the arms of Keyshawn Johnson second down don't you feel that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are a little jittery yes I mean even though that fumble wasn't a fumble that Hill they go back to pass and Brad Johnson gets hit the ball flops up in the air and Charles Woodson gets it and here they look like you know he's making frozen and not ready yet and I think Jon Gruden is trying to make this a fastpaced game and maybe his team isn't ready yet to get in a fastpaced mode second down and ten it's kind of a jumpy stuttering start to the game for five minutes having elapsed on second down Johnson he's way off the mark and gives us a chance to take a look at the open defense it's Charles Woodson Tory James each playing with a plate in their lower leg third down and ten keep driving tarah vicious and he's finally taken down inside the 40 of the 37 by the linebacker treyvion Smith maybe the Raiders knew something would check Bresnahan the defense coordinator said this is the guy that I worry about again here's Joe jerusha's here and you're going to see him come on across he starts up comes right across the linebackers waiting for him he gets right across in front of his face and right as he gets across there Brad Johnson has that ball ready and gives it to him 23 yard game on a third and 10 now and he's finally fed abounds by Rod Woodson good block by Alstott what else is new that was a very good block by Mike Alstott and that's it you have the alignment and then you have your fullback they always say that all snide isn't a true fullback but on this play is a true fullback he's playing a fullback position and watch his lead and block boom right there and pit them is right in behind him and breaks right off that block watch out Mike Alstott number 40 times this block I mean he hasn't it and just just as he gets it looks like he's gonna flush and then coupe he goes down and cuts the move that's a 24 yard gain so backtoback 24 yard games Aaron Stecker is now in the he'll behind us not the fake blanched it as he throws and it's incomplete that's Napoleon Harris we mentioned before a rookie picked in the first round out of Northwestern and he's done a great job starting this season you know and that's that's the thing that has to bother Jon Gruden because every past he had and the most important thing to him is past protection that he wants to get he wants to get the thing protected there it is from skycam and you can see what Brad Hudson acid' and you know why he had to get rid of that ball because Harris was coming or right on it a little delayed blitz Decker stays in yardline written down by the outside linebacker Eric Barton that's a great shot when you get a linebacker and he makes a tough tackle like that right at the line of scrimmage and gets up and pulls a divot out of his head and that's football football on real grass and and a beautiful day I mean you know you couldn't ask for anything better for the biggest game of the year in a place like this on a day like that I know what I said the scariest thing all week was the commissioner saying there might not be another game here going to build a new stadium they should move it here permanently what's he thinking third down and nine from the 13 yard line the pitman but through his hands and you complete so they have a 23 yard gain on 3rd and 10 then another 23 and then they bogged down and here comes dramatical they're trying to tie the game that was it was a good call on the defense by blitzing Napoleon Harris and that's the one that you know made Brad John's get rid of the ball when he didn't want to and then he gets in long yardage even had he completed that pass they still would have had to try the field goal here 31 yard attempt both teams with excellent kickers janakowski on one side Martine gramatica on the other Tom Cooper to hold Ryan Benjamin to snap it from 31 that one is good Romo trying for that fifth ring to his a Niner to Asda Bronco and then he left Denver found a home in Oakland and here he is in the Super Bowl again so three three with gramática to send it down in the direction of Marcus night it's a bouncing ball fielded by night and he's rolled out of bounds up near the 30yard line so the game is on a spectacular Sunday and the field almost encased in shadow now started out half and half you can see where the line goes as the Raiders start to the 30yard line he's tackled by brunch and John what about the change at center or what's going to happen with with true replacing Robinson no Adam true is not a stiff I mean he's a guy that you know started 14 games at center for the Raiders last year he's a good player he's not as big or as strong as Robin but he's quicker and you know and he gets to his blocks but he gets to that second level he gets to the linebacker world well he's good on screen so this isn't a big dropoff between these two second on four they go slip backs with corner and Richie Danis stepping away from is taught but out of bounds into the arms of Jerry Rice but he's on the chalk covered by Brian Kelly it'll be third down and Adam truths been holding his own so far I mean I mean here here he's going to get a mm you see him here and he's going to get some help here and and that's that's the thing that he does see how quick he is and we boom that ball goes he gets his hands right up there and there's no way that that Akal is going to get off a him so so you know they lose robins and it's a thing but it's not like putting a guy in there that never played if I we look to practice on Wednesday robbers didn't practice Oh true took every snap when at the practice yesterday third down and four and Gannon is going to go down again in the arms of Greg spires second time as you say that's that's the speed of this Tampa Bay defense you know you think of speed and you're thinking of defensive linebackers and you're thinking of defensive back but they have it here to watch fires he's going to overpower Lincoln Kennedy right there then turn on his speed I mean the speed comes from the time that he overpowers can be like that until he gets to the quarterback saying like the first part of the game and this is a beauty goes all the way to the 15 where it's fair caught just inbounds by Carl Williams you know John both teams playing a bit of hurry up but it's been an awkwardly paced first quarter yeah because I don't feel that the offenses are are really up to a hurry up yet I mean you have to be ready to take that pacing the defense's have something to say about that I mean so far both the defenses have been the dominant factors in this game you'll be on offense is trying to go up tempo but we've been able to establish it so here we go again will Tampa Bay starting this Drive the six and a half to go in the period from its own 16 yard getting with the boss I'm coming up to make the tackle it's Charles Woodson and we have John Lynch miked up is our man there's our man Jojo trying to cover him with linebackers ain't going to happen that was on Tampa's last drive when juror vicious brought the pass on third down to 23 on this one his tip and incomplete with a lot of white shirts in the neighborhood walk the fingertips of Mike Alstott you know and we're talking about that fast pace and hurry up and it works as long as you continue to get first downs but if you go fast pace and you're just three and out then what you're doing is you're not giving your defense any time to rest at all you're just getting them right back in there third down and nine now we've played nine minutes we've already had 22 plays in the game but it's it's like we're in mud here right now IV the offenses looked a little more especially the offensive line and the defensive lines look like they're not in my third i9 which you can do if your out of the pocket and it's fourth down so that's a three and out and that's the thing so the fastpaced thing doesn't work if you don't get first downs all you do is not even give your defense a chance to get a a good drink before they have to get back in there now time to but will punt and I think that hurts both these defenses but more the Tampa Bay defense because they're an undersized quick defense that can be worn down very important who's picked up toward the end of the season to run back kicks will be the recipient here and with room to roam from the 43yard line but the bucks get to him at midfield and take him down at about the 50 Jack gold in the first to hit him Zack Crockett is in the game he's a short yardage back normally and they give it to him and he takes it to the 45yard line we have Jerry Rice Mike the moment you go on the bench oh god if you guys get some points on the board pound ago I want you to insulate him guesstimate they can rush the passer but looking this time to work John that's Jerry quarter two wide receivers talking about running the world what is night I know and they're trying to run now they got big Langston Walker in as a tight end an extra block or make his run for ten and now it's Crockett so they run their short yardage back twice in a row from midfield he takes it to the 43 yard line third down and four bill callahan was talking about blanks to walker when they put him in and he says he increases our edge well hacky weighs three hundred and sixty pounds when you have a guy that big that has to make you have a wide edge over their first they start at Langston and they cut it back in but they're getting their power runners and their power blockers in and trying to go to that some of that stuff Jerry Porter was just talking about now Walker comes out in the backfield now garner comes in on third down and four he's offset back again fourman rush and pressure on Gannon and it's left away it's knocked away by spires who already has us actually have two saxon and knock down Gannon looking to get it to Jerry Porter and the big play was made by Ellis whims you know some of these times these tackles look like the same guy but you know it looks like Warren Sapp the way he plays but he gets a penetration and easily guy you're going to see him come right up the middle number 96 with the penetration and he's a guy that's going to make ganna bring the ball down you see it right there you see then he had to bring the ball down and then get it out to the side he just went right off his fingertips now let go whose first pot was a beauty from deep in his own territory this one more of a pooch kick that's fair caught by Carl Williams at the 16 yard line with 413 remaining so the story line being played out you know it's so funny we were time Brian Billick was talking about it on the the pregame show where you know one coach says you know I know this guy but he thinks I'm going to do that and that guy thinks I'm going to do this and all that you got paralysis by analysis well you know the interesting thing about the start of this game is both these teams script their first 15 so what we've seen offensively that has been scripted and obviously it doesn't work I mean I think that that the offense has looked a little conservative a little sluggish and to me that the defense has looked a lot better than a lot quicker if this was a strip this was a pilot that never saw air I'll tell you that so they had to start ad libbing here pretty soon from the 16 yard at first down this is Michael Pittman for a gain of five to the 21 yard line tackle there by Chris Cooper and I think they both came out with that idea of the fast pace and wanted to throw the ball a lot and do all those things and then they found out that it's hard to handle the pass rush that way and you have to get those pass rushers calm down before you go to some of those things is John Bruton is first 15mg past ten times around five five four three points now now Jon Gruden likes balance it's a lot more important to him than it is to the other side two of those plays really work the 223 now it's Jenson making his first tax on a slant tackle by Woodson this is going to be a very good match of Keyshawn Johnson is always going to go to the inside and he said you know he said I watch these corners and they always have their backs to the outside he said I'm never going to run to the outside anyway he said they're just set up for things that I like to do errands stick her in the backfield very vicious tons of motion Raiders with a blitz pressure injunction but he swings in a lane it's almost picked off by Rod Woodson they talked about rod playing in a Super Bowl again he was there with Pittsburgh he was there two years ago with Baltimore had the season turning play the 98 or hit inception long back and knows he should have had this one it's funny I don't think that Brad Johnson thought there was any way that Rod Woodson is going to get to that ball you see Rod Woodson is a deep guy and Brad Johnson kind of lobbed it in there a little too much andandand Rod Woodson is perfect at reading quarterback size he's been doing it all his life and he does that as well or better than anyone so Johnson's already thrown a cup under pressure to year picks and foregoing just won his last six regular season first of all of the game is Michael Pittman takes it up to the 35 but Brad Johnson is built the roller will make the call here in a moment Brad was hurt missed the last two games of the regular season and it's an illegal shifter formation for Tampa Bay and then you know Brad was out there was some speculation that it was a vertebrae problem we know it was a back problem and then came back for the playoffs and looked pretty good the last two weeks obvious yeah when he was out they looked terrible remember they had Shaun King in there and they had Rob Johnson in the end he couldn't even get the ball back to Linus brunch lingo two men moving in that setting number 79 was going down or the motion man was in continued emotion fiveyard penalty we played said second down and there is the back up to Brad Johnson that's Rob Johnson we saw him that night the Monday night game in Tampa when he took them on a long drive late in the game and then they caught the ball up and the X buffalo bill and Jacksonville Jaguar and the number three guy courses Shaun King who was the starter in the NFC Championship game in 99 came within five points are taken his team to is also distorted at my ask that one and this pass is dropped by Keyshawn Johnson pressure put on by Roderick Coleman as you can see in the last six games that Brad played how hot he was I mean you add them up it's 11 that's 15 touchdowns only one pick and then at that bottom game against Detroit they have the wind toward the end of the game he gets fallen upon by one of the Lions and that created the back problem and then he was inactive and and and they got a break when they didn't have to play that first week when they got the I thanks to the Jets and not both the back was to give him that buy and that's Erik Bart and coming up to take care of Pitman and their forced a punt you know this this is a tough thing for this offense when you when you can't pass because you can't get the pass protection or guys drop ball and you can't run because the Raiders in a running game are really getting penetration against this buck offensive line and there was Bruton who is totally exercised and frustrated with the offense to this point barking is the offense came off time to put a putt burying Gordon one a time I float into 33 and the former San Diego charger will turn the bring it back to the 49yard line and that's where Oakland will start just shy of midfield is the thing what you try and do on a punt returners form a wall you see Darren Gordon has a ball and right now the the Raiders form a wall on the on the right side and he just comes right across there now of course for four of the Buccaneers get to the outside but watch the wall form here there's a wall there's a wall there's a wall now that's the end of the wall so the next thing you're going to see are the orange jersey that was a good return and I'll tell you one thing this disc Tampa Bay Buccaneer specialties where all these players can cover as good at tacklers either on football they have no guests and going into the 44o Monte Kiffin is sitting right behind Jon Gruden the first thing airplane take shock seatbelt sign a steamer god of yet he sees brooding head come over thought you said you have to stop number 25 Rudy would know ain't going to stop him here short of the first down shutting up third and short for Auckland as the period winds down here's garner and kind of lost in the shuffle because you know about Gannon with rice and brown and guys like that a lot of publicity but it's 900 yards rushing and 900 yards receiving and when you get up in that neighborhood remember a thousand a thousand hasn't only been done by Roger Craig and Marshall Faulk well and he's the speed for that team if you don't took Jerry for green years wide receiver other than Charlie Garner speak third and reduce and it's intercepted by dexter jackson so each team with a pick Jackson brings it back to the fifty with nine seconds left in the quarter marc trestman the offensive coordinator the Raiders called at cluing in other words watching the quarterback size no one clues better than his own defense of the Tampa Bay Buccaneer this is that the two things that they did well is one the rush flush and then the other thing is they clue and they just wait and there and they're always in position that whatever happens the ball is in front of them it gets tipped they're going to be like desk Dexter Jackson right in position to get it we'll see what the line does first that's what really caused it the flush they flushed them out and made him throw that she's a senior does the question of Simeon rice what a move he makes on Barry Simms that's to the inside he gets across the 50 and that will be the end of the first 15 minutes of this scrum back in San Diego Al Michaels John Madden Melissa Stark Lynn Swann working the sidelines second quarter of Super Bowl 37 ready to begin three three Tampa Bay now with Jon Gruden watching his offense out there for the fifth time they've had a pick a field goal two punts and this possession after their interception and again the Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensively they're not a good running team and so they have to pass me half the Brad Johnson ask the pass quickly because he's not not a and he's off the mark again and he throws it behind Keyshawn Johnson he's been way off the mark under pressure again and down he goes and I think the key is he's under pressure all the time the fact that he doesn't run he's kind of a sitting duck back there and they know they know a point to rush to and they're going to get to that point and the Raider defensive line is doing a better job than the Buccaneer offensive line of keeping them off Brad Jones that's why Brad Johnson only completed four passes he's 4 out of 14 1 pick 3 other balls have been dropped third because looked like a junk Johnson for the moment pending the penalty first down and that has to be against Reagan Upshaw because as you said he did he did get the jumper he got off right on that ball against roving Obon there and I'm sure it is a good stuff cha know part of it is is these defensive ends want to get off in the ball and sometimes sometimes they start to anticipate the count and that time he just it was just a half of beat early offside 91 defense that penalty is declined Wiesel the play first out yeah he was breaking ups right here and as a defensive end you always want to be quick you always want to be the first one to get off and then sometimes it's just too early that is John Ritchie who's always bleeding every game and he's he has cuts along his eyebrow forehead Corollas going to stop playing for just a second you know what they call those things they call him calcium deposit I always thought they were just kind of like you know you get a cut then you get a scab then the scab breaks off but they say in his head he has two calcium deposits see him right and left funnel he's usually this is the second quarter now he's usually after about two minutes of the first quarter Keshawn men happy cup at least with a moment ago the offense is going and he's out takes the ball to the 37 yard line what's John Ritchey that's that's Keyshawn right there and that's why he came out for one play Bob Woodson with an elbow to the helmet that's why Keyshawn was on the bench in avenues back in receivers to the left including all stop by Keyshawn Johnson to Johnson first down inside the 30 that'll move the chains to about the 26 yard line I was interesting what they did is they had your triple or Bunch over on this side and then we're watching them the other day see here's what bunches have three guys right here together and that is a ball snap they all just dispersing it's really it's really tough if you mantoman you're going to get picked here's Keyshawn Johnson he was the inside guy if you're zone they're going to push and find one guy to get in a hole that time it was Keyshawn Johnson got in that hole and then he just got between him somewhere where he just gave Brad Thompson his number he's on three grabs out again nation is real substance has been replaces him and Oh bitch inside takes it to the 22 tackle there by Ron Rick Coleman this is the thing that Jon Gruden has done that has gone to two tight ends and two running backs in just one ride receiver and again it seems like when you get on this side of the 54 the buttons that the janta that mike wall scott is a big runner here this is where he does the best I mean he's a downhill runner he's powerful getting close to the goal line Mike wall Scott can become a real day and here to go big again with both Alstott and Barnes but Bill o Romanowski is right there to say enough already he's a he's a that's probably exactly what ropos say that enough with this you know I pride myself in it being a run stopper and that's why I'm in here and you guys have had your way in a couple of plays too much here you're going to see bill Romanowski is right here up in the end of the line of sprint it runs to the inside he starts outside then just flattens right down the line of scrimmage that he flattened a whole lot on that he's not Gary third date now from the 25 whoever Johnson going to the with Johnson being doubleteamed on the way down and now you're looking at a field goal of about 45 yards you know and that's one of the things about Brad Johnson he makes good decisions and as you said there was a doubleteam there Keyshawn Johnson was doubleteamed there was no way he was going to complete that pass so he just threw it away Tom tuple was spot the ball actually just outside the 33 so this is a 43 yard attempt by grammatica they're trying to give Tampa Bay its first lead of the Super Bowl from 43 kick kind of ass to ball started out as if it would hook about 20 pence Rome Attica we just kicked his second field goal since another bouncing ball the 11 yard line through the middle and he's taken down by Dexter Jackson from the 34 yard line Nannan becomes the scribe going over the middle and Jerry kortner who might play a very big role before this day is done for a nine yard grab I think the interesting thing here is this game is set up as the number one offense against the number one defense and it was number one defense better than number one offense and so far Tampa Bay looks like the number one defense or Gators both look Charlie garnet picking up the first down so they go nohuddle again at that point a little up tempo and that's only their second first down of the game which isn't a bad time to go no huddle because you can get the first down now you get a new set of downs and at least you're not going free and out from the 45 now you picked up and it's intercepted again by Dexter Jackson and he's across the 50 to the 45 yard line Dexter Jackson well right now he is the leader in the clubhouse for the MVP award you know it's an interesting thing there in Nikol and they're going to bring Ronde Barber down here so you see the safety just sitting deep there and he was just reading you're talking about gluing and you're talking about watching eyes Dexter Jackson is just sitting back there and watching rich Ganon's eyes to know they had they excuse me I was just saying they had the nickel defense in there Ronde Barber blitz oh he thought that he wasn't going to have a free safety in there and boom there was Dexter Jackson City you know Dexter had three during the regular season two Johnson starts to stumble falling backwards and passes incomplete John you know you look at that Tampa Bay defense and this is part of the reason they were clearly number one overall and number one against the pass well you know here's Ronde Barber we talked about that he's the fifth defensive back they get the whole thing picked up and I think when Gannon sees Ronde Barber coming he thinks Corner blitz so he thinks man demands he throws that post in there and doesn't see Dexter Jackson second and ten now from the 45yard line out of the backfield taking it to the 40yard line under ten minutes to play we were talking to Brad Johnson the other day and I loved his description of course the offensive guys love that Gruden came in and Tony Dungy they liked him but he was a defensive guy and it was Johnson who told us the other day about Jon Gruden he said he'd love to be in a disco when Gruden is the DJ oh yeah he's a motivator I mean you watching her practice in fact the other day and he was trying to simulate the Raiders offense here and the quarterback position for the scout team the fantasy camcorder third and five and the pace is incomplete and Keshawn is going to look for a flag and not get one covered by charles woodson and he can't believe that he didn't get a flag there was invited Charles Woodson Charles Woodson is an amazing guy he has a broken fibula he's playing with a plate in his right leg he played last week didn't play very well if I can see he doesn't really have his movement or his quickness and and to be honest I think the Raiders are just trying to get by with him out there for me because Charles Woodson with a plate in his leg isn't really Charles Woodson good noncall now tim brown will go back to accept this punt i think they feel a little better with tim brown they're catching the ball in this situation than with Gordon and he fair catches it at the 11 yard line it was good to have a surehanded receiver in a situation with his a push bunt and very little chance of a run back Super Bowl 37 3 field goals to by grammatical one by Janikowski and now the Oakland Raiders begin this drive from their own 11 yard line Gannon five out of ten two picks two sacks empties the backfield throws in a hurry and it's off the hands of Brown again the blitz that time by Ronde Barber up the middle you know and I think I think the key is froze in a hurry and that's that's what this Tampa Bay defense does to you is a they can they can pressure you with a blitz or with not but there but for is is so fast it you can see over here you see that they have the the unbalanced there they have four against two so they're going to get a free Russia or crew rushes Ronde Barber and he gets in that position when they go nickel second and ten little pump fake and then up and down he goes that Simeon rice who had an earlier set and for Tampa Bay and Monte Kiffin the defensive coordinator I mean they just been quarterback killers this year when you take a look at what they have done I mean one of the interesting things here the regularseason look at that bottom number the pass reading that's forty eight point four so all of the opposition quarterbacks have a pass reading 248 for if your QB with that rating and there it is in postseason you have 48 for your on the waiver wire runner but that's that's what this defense will do to you third down and 11 complete over the middle that one intended for Jerry Porter three and out again there's a warrants at running down there he's being a cheerleader death will have to we're putting pressure on this I'll show you want a number one offensive how about us were the number one defense and in the Superbowl you have a neutral crime it's half and half a lot of you know corporate people obviously know Len it's not a regular season crowd so it's a little quieter than it would normally be and Warren trying to disturb the masses at least on this side of the field left with a punt out of the end zone and inside the 32 the 27 yard line so the flow the complete flow right now with the Buccaneers right and it all started with that desk Dexter Jackson interception then they went three and out they didn't get anything maybe offensively but they did get some field position they got the punt the Raiders back them up then they stopped them then the Raiders had a punt so this field position is kind of a result of that Dexter Jackson intercept going back to it sure Callahan frustrated obviously offensive in the defensive lead after to make a stay in here more than three from the 27yard would whole sports the right side tackled by doorstep and that until he gets to the 21 per gain of six and this is a thing that you know we talked about the Raiders I've really felt offensive way they'd be satisfied just to pass the ball every down and they're not having success doing that now the Buccaneers in John groovy Jon Gruden wants balance and sometimes he'll pass earlier and then when he gets a lead I'll guarantee he's going to run the other time he's going to run is when he gets down in this area of the field second and four gives us a picnic inside the technically first down and goal that's what they do you know we talked about those at that position we talked about you you're getting that defense three and out you can see that they're starting to wear a little now watch them Sam Adams here's a block they're going to get they get a good double team get him push get him burned out and Mike Pittman runs right off of that doubleteam and he sets up a situation where Warren Sapp now comes in offensively to provide leverage on the left side there he is in a four pointed stance on first and goal to go the way was all stop and he takes it to just outside the one you know usually they runs the warren sapp side in fact Gruden was saying you know them and this isn't a gimmick thing when we put SAP in there he said he's he's as good at blocking tight end as written foot is ruins and football watching him practice the other day they do have a past tool and he said the big thing he has to do is fake him on the line of scrimmage because he's not going to be in a think that's open was it their doing here I would if you're going to do it this is a down second and goal instead it's all started into the endzone for the game's first touchdown that's what john bruton says you can see him going up and down with his left hand he called that pound in the rock he says we got to get down there we have to pound the rock again they go right in Sam Adams watch number 60 we're going to see Posey Coleman make this block right here this is a big one you got to control the line of scrimmage control the big guy at the line of scrimmage to get a little movement so that all spots could get back in there and push it in dramatic ax there was 624 remaining now and a half while his team is up 13 3 as romanika sins a 100 bars on Marcus night schooled at the 29yard line making in flying in was cory ID for the tackle I'll tell you one thing this Tampa Bay Buccaneer to have brought their tack words today I mean they're you know we talking about tackles on defense and note guests and but but special teams are the same way I mean they're open field tackling and I think they've always been good tackle I mean they're they're they're one of those group sticks I don't think they keep players that don't tackle I know they don't keep defensive players can't tackle they don't have any of those things they call cover corners the cover corner can that play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a great job tackling covering against the Raiders who can get inside and that is income ruff bye garner this is the seventh Oakland possession they have gained 39 yards in six projectors yeah and I think a load all starts with the front four of the Buccaneers I mean they're getting pressure I mean every every time Gannon gets back there he doesn't have time to set you know I mean he always has to move and move as he throw and throws when he doesn't want to him and the Raider offense or pass offenses a rhythm offense and this front floor of the Buccaneers is keeping him out of any rhythm second down and 10 from the 20 donar by crossing John they're also doing it without booger McFarland who got hurt he would make that front for even more potent and then char trick Darby who is playing in there is kind of injured himself and and they kind of rotate in there you know Ellis whims has been in there a few times and he's come up with big play great spires the left hand has had more big plays in his first I remember ever seeing him as McFarland the Raiders have had five straight three announced trying to convert on third makes the catch he gets positioned inside Dwight Smith and who's the change that was great by rich can in there because he was getting to blitz on that side you know that's it's easier to throw away from the side of the Blitz of blitz was coming from his left and he threw that ball to Porter to the left what says here comes a blitz on this side and he's going to scroll to that side after they picked up their first first down since the beginning of the game at his garner stop behind the line of scrimmage now only one team in the history of the Super Bowl has ever overcome a deficit of ten points to win the game and it was right here it was in 1988 after the even seventh season Washington against Denver the Broncos unbelievably led 10 to nothing in the final score was 42 to 10 Redskins they have 35 points in the second quarter second and 11 and Gannon sidearms the 47yard line to its third and about seven upcoming when you assume that the Raiders should be able to come back because they aren't one of those you know ball control run the clock out play defense type of team they're they're the number one offense in football and in his first athletes should they haven't shown that banning seven of 15 for some point I mean you have tim brown we have Jerry Rice in that Jerry Porter have to get the ball to lose go 1647 rating third down and six let's drop Tim Brown incomplete Dwight Smith covering a little bees time Brahma clearly a catchable ball I mean Tim brown's been playing for 15 years and he's caught so many passes in his career that that's one that he usually catches but i think you know we're talking about rhythm and the offensive team of the raiders being a rhythm team this Jampa bay defense has really kicked them or knock them out of River that Tampa Bay defense can make the opposition offense looked lethargic and that's exactly what they've done lek lers punt his fare caught on the run by carl williams at the 23 yard line to the Bucks Abbott back again and Monte Kiffin who was inherited by grood remember Monty was there with Tony Dungy for all of those years he was in place when Gooden got the job looking Gruden and everybody knows the story if our souls is going to take the job then they looked at Putin but the greater price was too high at that point then they went to guys like Nick Saban and Ralf region and college and Mariucci had a chance then they went back to Gruden finally at the end made the deal I'm thinking you know John if Bruton doesn't get the job what do they do fill it on monster.com well that's that's going to be a problem I mean the Glazer family would be completely embarrassed that's why they had to pay the 8 million the two first or two second they had to get John Gruber second down and there is a flag exactly the junk yard be interesting if the if the Buccaneers were to win this Super Bowl how many owners in football would give eight million dollars in two first and two seconds this year to win next year's Super Bowl a few more than whatever year ago it would be an interesting vote but I would I would bet at least 30 of them right now and in the glasses lower the first row they are very is thank you John that's Malcolm Glazer the president behind him his sons yes he has the sons and daughters who are all very involved in the team running the team and there is the the price a first in a second this past draft his firstround pick and the next draft and then the secondround pick in 2004 eight million bucks and then of course you have to pay Gruden yeah but if he wins the Super Bowl anything with it that's they brought him in to get over that hump if he can get them over that hump he's worth it and there's al Davis the recipient of the eight million some of those guys let's pick up and then opens up a big hole through for pitman it's almost as if the bugs know exactly what the Raiders are going to do well now they do because they have him on the ropes and they know that and I'll tell you this about Jon Gruden if he has a lead he's going to sit on when he gets ahead he's going to run the ball they had trouble with their pass protection so he started to run the ball again another good lead blocked by Mike Bostock boom right there and guilt and Pitman is showing his speed and quickness now second down and one it's angled down by Dorsett and finally Romanowski up near midfield and that's going to take us to the twominute warning so the Bucks are on the move again as we come to the twominute warning in Super Bowl 37 and stuff around the game and running back what is revoir that's one of the things that has haunted the Raiders all year are just penalties you know that you know they they have to get something going now you know the Buccaneers have the momentum and they have to take the momentum away from and the last thing they need is a stupid jump offsides defense fiveyard County replay first out I think I tell Reagan up show that's about enough of an we don't need any more of these you know there's tough enough stopping these guys down they run but you see what they did Jon Gruden Buccaneers I start to run six plays in a row six running plays in a row then they get you playing to run hard then they go play backs and that's right what Brad Johnson likes to do and that's what Jon from the 37 first and 5 after the flag and Brad Johnson and that's incomplete hi for Ricky Dudley the X Raider who couldn't hold in over the middle the greatest running performance in Super Bowl history was here in January of 88 Timmy Smith and here is as you can see Clarence Davis one of John's Raiders Tom Maddie had a 76 yard first half and the class of third Super Bowl and there's Pitman who has been ahead he's had a decent year the numbers are an electrifying came over from Arizona as a three here's Pittman adding to that yardage in the flag comes in at the end of the play the Pittman's one of those guys if you're not ready for he can knock you out you know I think that you have to you can't ignore you know when you're playing Tampa Bay you just can't say all stop Keyshawn Johnson McArdle and so on you better say it now if you're ready for them I think you can handle it but if you're not ready for them and it doesn't look like the Raiders are ready for them and it looks like they have other thoughts of things that they have to stop and you know Michael Pittman is at the top of that list illegal use the hands hands to the face number 99 defense fiveyard County per man the run automatic first off the Lawrence grant John you were talking about it they got away last week with all those penalties in there they had nine in the first ethicist Tennessee but down by ten you know I mean when you talk about Championships and the way championships are won and whether it's defense or offense you can't do stupid thing I mean you can't have penalties you know if you're a lot better than opponent you can have come they're going to kill you so Jerry Rice Jerry's been shut out through the first 28 minutes the backfield because Eric Barton who has his foot worked on before is back in an offensive you know and you say Jerry Rice has been shut out I think that that a lot of that is you know I'm just watching Tampa Bay Buccaneer coverage they're not doing anything special you know they're just playing zone keeping everything in front of them there's no no special tight coverage or anything that they're doing the Jerry Rice I think it's all about the pass protection and rich kin and not let them get in rhythm second down and 11 from the 30yard line Johnson throws and that's keeps on making a sliding grab as he went down on the grass and was able to fall it in a little short of the first down the Spotted to 20 you know wide receivers love quarterbacks when they put the ball there I mean it looks like it's a little behind but what he does he brings him to the ground so he's not going to take that big hit he lets him go down he doesn't run him right into the safety see see Rod Woodson number 26 is going to be there I think a very big play here John for the Oakland Raider defense because if they let him convert here and they go in for a touchdown a big difference obviously between 22 3 and 16 well you know that Oakland Raider offense not getting first downs history Anette have killed this Raider defense and you can just see that they're starting to get worn down they're tired and it's that type of thing because they've been out there in the field too long because their offense hasn't been able to this will be Tampa's 42nd play of the hand that's a big number 31 four stars we've got second effort picking up the first down initially stop and then is able to angle forward and the first down and another timeout is called by the buccaneers liquid bank doesn't really have to go to the endzone because I still have one time the outside OS bank slips a tackle and picks up the first down as he breaks out of Charles Woodsen's grasp to the five if they do Brad Johnson was saying the way that they key this if if they see Romanowski playing on the slide other words if they see this when this last they see Romanowski out here they know that its own so that's his presnap read at any time Romanowski is out on the slot he's going to have zone if they have a corner out on them it's going to be man it's on Woodson is out watch the door first and goal 34 Texan one timeout left with a bucks in Tennessee to the outside I'm a car down spins away from the coverage charles woodson the defender touchdown Brad Johnson was perfect there that's the thing you have tight coverage this is one of the things they work on putting it on their back shoulder Brad Johnson put it on Keenan McArdle back shoulder and wad Rod Woodson I mean Woodson was on Jarvis he was on his front shoulder thirty seconds now remaining in the hackers gramatica tries to tack it on and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have now out gained Oakland 198 yards 258 three defensive penalties on that drive for the Raiders you see when you get to tight coverage here the Cardell is going to run up and if he doesn't get by him he throws it to the back shoulder that's exactly what he did there you see now Woodson is playing the front shoulder he's played in the front of him and Brad Johnson just throws it to the backside of McArdle's after you catch one of those and you know that you got a guy where you want them you try and go for your dunk I think that dunk was a little short and there's Alstott it is Bruton sat Keyshawn Lynch and this is just the end of the first half yeah these are end of game type celebrations he's been kicking the bouncers all day drop night picks it back up at the nine taken down the toe and again just spectacular coverage by their special teams unit interestingly Gruden was telling us throughout the season I'm worried about kickoff return coverage not today let's go to John Lynch Mike though like every play they've run we're an infraction I know it's on it's on are you vote yeah well that's what happens when your coach was their coach right and that gives you a heck of a lot of confidence when you know that there's nothing that's keeping you off balance that you feel so good about your defensive plan their offensive plan he gets hit by SAP they had a rhinestone on that time and that's incomplete again we talked about how it all starts as a great defense no cover dude's own all those things but it all starts right here with this with this front floor and being able to get pressure on the quarterback and they've been all over the N in this first half and this has been relentless pressure by this Tampa Bay defense all year long the rate of critics who say this team is too old and they showed they weren't too old but this Tampa Bay defense to make it look whatever device the Raider offensive line has been a heck of a past protecting offensive line but they aren't in this first half but if the Raiders pass and if it's incomplete they still can pull it off I would be surprised if they do but we'll see here third down they're just going to want it and that's the way the half is going to end well pushing shoving and all of the rest and so the Tampa Bay Buccaneers first ever Super Bowl appearance a dominant first half twenty two three Tampa Bay they lost in the Monday nighter next to last week to Pittsburgh it looked like they blew their chance at the by they wouldn't had to win a wild card game a couple of games on the road then they got win against Chicago when Green Bay lost to the Jets a much easier road and we were talking to Brad Johnson about that the other day when when you brought that up he just let all the air out himself and there's a big sigh of relief because he said he probably would have been able to play in a wildcard game he said but but that one week extra was just magic they still had to win in Philly oh it again the bid last week as the peppers fielded by night from the again a solid hint as Darien Barnes number 30 crunches them up at about the 27 yard line first half started in bright sunshine now the legs take full effect was the second half per message from the 27 yard can't escape it for a very short gain order makes the catch again and in post season against the Jets big second half of course two TDs they win going away against the Titans last week to 86 through the year and four touchdowns and now this one third line you know one of the things that Gill Callahan was saying is he likes to start the game with cbz calls and his confidence builders for Rich Gannon I think part of it his confidence builders didn't work so now maybe start with CDs of the second down and step over the middle by Doug jolly another guy who you figured could have emerged maybe as a big year that's his first catch of the game that working tight ends and I think that these passes here are the confidence builders but in having the confidence builders I mean they would be the short type of passes that you're going to have a high percentage of completion and again where the quarterback can give back you know stroke quickly just just get the ball out of there watch out for Barry Brooks a gap in the middle as you can see for them to expect to be famous Kelly says I didn't touch them intended for Marcus night and there is no flag and that's when those confidence builders don't work because when you have those short passes the quick passes and then you have another three and out the Kelly's playing real well on this I mean he just gets there in a jam and it's hard it's hard to run a little quick or a short foot against tight coverage because there's no time to get separation let go to punt Carl Williams back to the box fair catch for four at the 21 and flat comes in at the end of the play when they we talked about this crew being an allstar crew and how you really don't like them and I believe the crews working together but this crew tonight and the first half I think has done a pretty good job but yeah they've been conspicuous by their absence they haven't and I think that's always the best officiated games the ones that you you don't notice the official you don't talk about the officials and they go black in the back 26 on the kick was in the air and yard pounding first out Tampa Bay starts from the 11 yard line early in the third quarter they start with Pittman as the tailback lost on flunking beginning in the second half as Lohmann ascii finally runs them out at the 16 yard line and let's take a look at the Bucks Star Trek yeah what guys have done Brad Johnson was a slow start but then picked it up Pittman big half and Keyshawn was four catches I think that was a big thing as pit Leonor the or the Bucs being able to run the ball you know they started out slowly and it looked like Brad Johnson couldn't get into any kind of rhythm Jon Gruden calling the plays started to go to Pittman and to run and then everything started to flow for the buck offense and that is the middle linebacker that's Napoleon Harris who gets shaken up the rookie the radar defense looks like they're lethargic and slow they don't look like I'm just looking at their silent it won't look like they will just as a super bowl this is the World Championship this is it I mean that you have the feeling that the Buccaneers are out there fighting for a world championship and I don't know that I have that same feeling about the Raiders right either side of the ball and of course the Tampa Bay defense making the offense lift lethargic second down from the 17 on the tour spinnaker Pittman speaking of hitman he came over from Arizona again they had done an allstar in the backfield for so long they let done go he signed with Atlanta brought Pittman in from Arizona and as you can see as a cardinal he had 200 yard games in his first three starts 32 from the 19 is Johnson has to step it up and and he doesn't do that very often but he does it with effectiveness here on a third down with a gain of ten and in this football in the NFL the way it's played now quarterbacks have to make that play right there when you get Sweden third and three third and four if there's nothing open you have to be able to run for a first down now in the quarterbacks in this game I thought this would be done I thought this would be part of it but I thought the quarterback and the other team would be deployment not Brad Johnson as long as the run of the season was 10 yards we're wondering about Brad runs is a tough guy and for Brad Johnson you think back to the Minnesota Vikings in 92 Ganon's there but Gannon loses the starting spot to Shaun Salisbury in the playoffs and then Johnson gets drafted and he's the third guy most of the year and like Gannon I mean you look at their careers and there are a lot of parallels journeymen don't get a chance to start some injuries and then all of a sudden they wind up in the Super Bowl and it's just y'all sticktoitiveness me both these quarterbacks are tough guys were both an event you know had their ups and downs and they stayed with it and stayed with it and then finally came out the other end Gannon Kent well as always can't wait to get back out here with him dig his home elope on the sidewalk second going to leave like he Shawn Johnson up to the 40yard line and that will move the trains again and the thing is his Keshawn was really looking forward to this game he says you know you can be good but you can't be great and tell you when is Super Bowl but again do you see Rod Woodson 26 coming in here and what Brad Johnson does it's a slant he puts the ball down you see he didn't run him in yo all those hits that they have a helmet the helmet the safeties on a lot of them are caused by the quarterback that's the opposite that's a second time that Brad Johnson did that for Keyshawn James first intern at before the Argonne a little high off the fingertips of my coil start never see that old thing where I get so much muscle you know he gets musclebound Muscle Beach in any a can't lift his arm to comb his hair if you feel that way but awesome that's jet time the other is shoulders and arms and you know stuff for so big he just couldn't lift him up he catch the ball always goes to the Provo because they list him as a fullback and is kinda half full back half tailback older I will say in this game he's playing this position a lot which is the fullback position hybrid as they run a little misdirection up to the 43 yard line you know I'm looking at the Bucks John and you see Austin they have so many you know recognizable guys that loquacious they're funny SAP and you know Keyshawn and guys like that and you know Mike is quiet but everybody knows about him he see he does play a distinctly different game well yeah and you know I mean they like him when I get down close to the goal line and you know he's a hard runner and sometimes in a game when the defense gets worn down we'll take five six seven guys as a nickname eight wait addy has to step it up right here third down and seven Joe Vicious makes the catch for the a first down as he gets pushed out of bounds now the call but Jojo vicious is going through something isn't he isn't white as a baby and the baby is sick and in the hospital and yelling and you're torn you shy with your wife and baby defense that penalty is declined here's on the play first down and he should be with your wife and baby but then you got a championship game last week a Super Bowl game this week and you talk about a guy that has a lot of emotion and a lot of stuff going up inside that helmet question Joker officials right now that didn't practice before the Philly game made the key play early in the game meanwhile Tim Braun his life up and open expecting prunes at any moment that penalty meanwhile on up Shaw again for the line of scrimmage by Pirela vozack discharge and this this is a type of thing you know we talked about the first half of the how the Bucks had the ball and the and the Raiders were three and out and then time of possession this is what it does it just wears this defense down and I could see it in the first half Raider defense was worn down and now it just carried over in the second half they can't stop it of course they had another stupid penalty too second second in 11 that's what discipline drink your milk and cookies but that's it you don't jump off side y'all Google stupid thing Jerell vicious deep into open territory outofbounds at the 14 yard line Warren Sapp saying first down and I think albaqi you said was was good protection and that's the thing watch his group right here in the protection you see they form a perfect pocket brad johnson could look he looks to his left he can step up cleanly what he looks to his left and then he comes back and then and then he could step up and put everything on that wall Jo Jo bishop but when you can do that when you can give Brad Johnson that kind of that kind of time he makes those kinds of throws 33 yards to Jerry Miculek got a 23 yard in the first act taken down by Roderick Coleman if for minimal games strive began back at the 11 yard line after the Raiders trying to make some sort of a statement I offensively go three and out on their series and meanwhile here goes Tampa marching all the way down the field and then they make no statement defensively except catching I mean I mean right now all they're doing out there is catching and they're taking the blows I mean you know if this were a heavyweight fight Tampa Bay would have been getting a lot of body blows so the big guys is sack on the side on and he can smell it home second down and nine Johnson on a roll here and the tight end gets down on the oneyard line so dilgar gets into the act that's his first guy Pat Johnson he is starting to have fun now and this is after you get the running game going then you can do this you can go play fast you can go bootleg which this play is you know and have guys wide open but you know if you can't run then you can't do these kinds of things so it all started in that second quarter when the Bucs got their running game going and they always say to keep your head up first trying to go back to dilgar again flag flag down back at the 10yard line and this one is against Tampa you know whatever whatever that thing is that they you know you have to come up with to to change momentum to make a play to get something happen the Raiders don't look like they're worried about that there's the face number 67 offense 10yard penalty replay first down we see enough games I mean body language is so big and again we can give you some isolated shots to show you things like that but you there's no fire from anybody and that's the way I feel I mean just looking at the sideline and looking at the guys on the field that there isn't I mean this this is emotional this is if this is for the championship of the world this is Super Bowl 37 went off here Tampa Bay understands it first been going on here goes kitten to the eight yard line you know and john bruton was one of those guys the kind of a disciple of a bill walsh philosophy that says that you throw early and then and then once you get the lead in the second half is where you do most of your running okay they've done a lot of running on the right side behind cozy Coleman and Kenyatta Walker watch these two guys right here they've been doing that all day just taking that tackle and driving hammer right into the ground and that fair vote between the tackle in the guard has been a big big hole punch the receivers to the left and the pass is caught by McArdle touchdown well they got here mainly with their defense but then with Bruton John said we really came along offensively during the latter stages of the season and it's all coming to fruition tonight and they and they got it in the in the first half when they started the running then they got the pass protection because now the Raiders are fired they're not getting the pass rest they're there they're missing tackles they're doing all the things that bad defenses do because the Bucks put him in that position gramática the 27th point that drive 89 yards I think a lot of the Buccaneers have that same feeling that you can be good but your legacy to be great have to have a Super Bowl because John Lynch said the same thing get taken up to two by Marcos night waiters in die it's a good run gets taken down by Ronde Barber so there's Barbara all over the field on special teams as well with a textbook tackle in Hawaiian some of these guys come to with us as well Danny Johnson panting starts this drive with Charlie garner and now the Raiders obviously going in no huddle with 20 minutes left in the game when the buck defense has been playing the same group again you know four defensive linemen two linebackers not playing al singleton and playing their fifth defensive back white Smith the whole game so did intercepted by Nickelback and he gets by Ganon and goes in for the touchdown he trying to hit Jerry Rice instead it's a 44 yard interception return you know four to five and Dwight Smith is a five he's playing right corner and he's playing it out here on Jerry Rice you see him off here he's just playing zone and he just reads that you see he was he was like ten yards off of Jerry Rice and and as we said to hook them the thing that these guys do the best is they key the quarterback side white Smith was like ten yards off just watching the quarterback all the way and he got a big jump on that one third pick of ganon in the game my Dexter Jackson and grammatica puts one through and the Gulf Coast is starting to rock already white Smith still exulting up there by John Lynch on the sidelines recounting the play Derrick Brooks the defensive player of the year and for Gannon three picks happen II looked at Jerry Rice on that one and you know we said how the buck defense is just playing John wrong I mean they're just making their zones deeper now and just reading hopper Marcus Knight from the six and again great coverage when I go back to grooming telling us each time we detain for this year you know I'm really worried about kickoff return coverage they got that fixed from the 18 Gannon again going to work with less than five minutes remaining in the third and it just continues this time it's Ella swims with the sack now let's watch that interception again by Dwight Smith and you'll see the coverage he is we're talking about five defensive backs here's Ronde Barber here's two three four five defensive backs now right here is Dwight Smith and you see see how off he is and and he's just looking in and reading Rich Gannon and he got a jump of about seven yards on that play watch him here he's coming off he's not looking at Jerry Rice he's looking at at Rich Gannon when Rich Gannon gets ready to throw he gets ready to jump and when he throws he beats Jerry Rice to the ball but that's all they're doing you know saying how they stopped and Jerry Rice how they stopped from Tim Brant understand all they're doing is playing a zone and as this game goes on that zones getting softer and there is Greg spires who had a sack and a big first half the defensive end who's hurt expires had a great start to this game remember this one here there he is on Lincoln Kennedy and then you see him just pushing here and then and then he goes to make the tackle looks like he just got his leg twisted there okay that was big I mean I think you know the start Greg spires kind of started it out for this Buccaneer front floor and then Simeon rice came up next and then the middle guy started taking over so it hasn't been just one it hasn't just been Warren Sapp er it hasn't just been Simeon rice this guy here has made a lot of big plays today for this defense well so much was made of the number one offense against the number one defense and we talked about it during the pregame show john and it's reflected in the score is reflected in that and historically defensively the better the great defense beats the great offense well I mean they they're proving it here right now second in 11 again in five years one out and wouldn't you know it he still completes that one to a Buccaneer that's Jermaine Phillips and then outofbounds intercepts and just complete frustration is is as come in now I mean that's that's the thing and that's that's what this buck defense does to you I mean they're very physical and they do all the physical things to you but but they also do they also do those things where they just make you be patient and then you want to be patient and then pretty soon you're down like this if 3043 you still third and 11 Primus 17 over the middle finally a big play through the air to dump jolly the tight end up to the 43 yard line much made of one versus one but let's expand it a little bit and if you take a team in the top three an offense against the top three they've been nine such games in the history of the Super Bowl the defense is one eighth and right now we're on our way to nine out of ten you know I thought maybe that was something that used to be true through as much today the way shitballs being I don't agree with what I thought I agree and here is rice and there's a flag because there's a facemask Brian Kelly with a facemask and Brian's trying to say no no I got his shoulder fed now these face masks are getting so big now that you can start off for a shoulder and on the way to grab a shoulder pad you grab a hunk of that face mask because they stick out so far but it was just something that you know we talk about defense and this defense there's no other greater offense player grabbed his jersey second down Kelly and Kelly was right yeah that's him here he is here he is on Jerry Rice right here after Jerry Rice catches a ball no that wasn't even close to a facemask was it just the shirt least the one official threw it not a net official very vices first day 32 minutes into the game and that's incomplete intended for Doug jollies but the Raiders began the day with a field goal off a pick and then their last six possessions ugly interception punt punt then the end of the half three and out to start this half another pick for a touchdown and the total yardage is 108 yards were opened at this point again you know you know what I think Tampa Bay or John Gruber did is is they kind of both started out for sailing well you know trying to throw the ball and up close and uncle it didn't work he went to the running game third and four from the 48 it over the middle and out of the it over the middle and out of the hands of Porter and a flag down at the Tampa 45 you know and he was able to change that thing I mean I think he was the first one to get his offense out of a funk I mean they were both and in a funk when they started rootin got his offense out Callahan never did get 53 defenses automatic first down the spot of the foul Shelton quarrels man look at that thick face al her stroll the great character is you died this week at the age of 99 I only wish he had lived a little longer and just once drawn Gruden you know when you look at Gruden's face it is a Hirschfeld character yeah and you wonder how one face can get in those many positions first at 10 446 sidearm John Ritchey inside the 40 to the 39 Rich Gannon is as great at that throwing throwing balls at different angles you know and he says the way football is today you know it used to be that pass rushers would just rush and now now they try and take lanes away from you get their hands up and those kinds of things so he said there's sometimes the only way you can get it in a lane is to throw exciton like you did there so he's like a Don Drysdale of football yeah whether you know how to bring a little much heat to heat Iceland or second down and three third and Kareena from as time this time and it is caught out of the end zone and wouldn't you know it border beats the secondary but the pass is throwing a hair too long and you look at the future of the Raiders and this is Jerry Porter is going to be the guy because it now if they don't have him in here again as I said earlier there's not a lot of speed there and you see he's just going to go right by Dwight Smith there and he has so much speed watch him here I mean he can turn on another gear wedge Smith just fell down I don't know this could be a catch al you know at this point there and then he drags that left foot I think that's a touchdown well and Gannon got up to the line and you could almost tell by the way he was slowing getting to the line and they were going to go for it on fourth down here that the Raiders are going to challenge but you saw it Jerry Porter speed there I mean he I mean he had a gear and then he got in front behind Dwight Smith and then the ball was in the air and he had another clear pass where he'll the plane now when Carollo goes over they look for two things obviously inbounds and then possession so the first thing he does he looks at the feet you look at the feet first and then you look for possession so now I think we have to look at possession because he did have feet right is it the right foot and then he drags the left but the ball the ball is rolling around a little bit he still has control him it doesn't hit the ground or he doesn't drop it or anybody ever the Reta keep the resonate they hate to see that though they hate when that ball begins to roll around see his feet look like they're ramming the left foot he's dragging at the right foot is clearly and but the ball is rolling and you have to exhibit control of it as you're going out of bounds and I don't think he's I don't think Carollo overturns this okay just to be contrarian I think he does weight was baby because I think he has control of it John anything to hold an audience both hands on he runs into the wall and doesn't drop it but it's rolling around and you know I I have a feeling Corollas gonna say he just he doesn't have either control right there he has good control and now he's out I mean now I mean I know he has to maintain to control me had he fallen down outofbounds I know he has to maintain maintain control of the ball and those things but I don't know if he's gonna say that the ball did move as he brought it into his chest that would be after all's going to take only about half e a lot of time he has seen enough as Whitey Herzog once said when asked how did you get thrown out of the seventh game of the World Series with the score eight nothing white he said I'd seen enough after reviewing the play has been determined to the receiver possessed and caught the ball with both feet inbounds throughout the plasma kick in the fist the players reversed to a touchdown and charged with the timeout you see so much for Tom Brady trying to you know sit on the ball last year right right but sometimes contrariness good I thought I thought that was a heck of a catch though to be able to keep the feet in and drag that in and the control I mean he just had both hands out there and this guy is going to be the future of the Oakland Raiders you say who's going to be their star five years from now the way to start five years from now is going to so for two scores a touchdown a delayed reaction touchdown but nonetheless it's 34 and finally gets into the end zone and go for two why'd you wait that long to throw deep territory at down in the arms of Simeon rice almost untouched around the corner and when he gets untouched around the corner his first step is so quick and then he gets right into that second third and fourth one sim in right he's darn near in a sprinter stance air now if you try and block him Barry Sims gets out there a little late but he's way too quick for that I mean there's no way you're going to be able to step inside and then step back outside and ever get Simeon rice there's a guy that's had a heck of a year you know they're sitting right remember when he was in Arizona people weren't sure and then he came to Tampa and he was kind of you know pretty good but you know not big enough to play the run and didn't do all that was like this year this year he has been a complete player and let's on the subject of receivers enjoy reporter here's Lynn Swann well thank you very much remember back in the AFC Championship game I know you do John we were watching it together we watched Jerry Porter drop a pass in the end zone to recall that play right during the week I talked to Jerry Ford and I asked him what happened on that play he's such a sure handy guy he said Swann I look down and see where I was on the football field took my eye off the ball I said well not when you think after you you've had that experience he says in the same situations I'll never take my eye off the ball right there that's a market receiver that's going to get better year after year in one week he realized focus on the ball you make the catch kick their body and bounce it's a touchdown you know John you're talking about the future to me and Porter clearly is but the Raiders are going to have to really cut in pair here in the offseason is it going to be millions of dollars over the counter line drive kick off is taken to the second line and this is Smith let me get back up to the 30 but we have John Lynch miked up and let's check in and find out what's going on I'll tell you one day I remember when I get out of coaching and came up to the booth and then a couple years later I went down on the sidelines of scrimmage I forgot how hard they hit web interrupted looks like you're just taking guys down and get down picks up a couple I thought that that earlier miked up with Lynch and this is a whole here against Tampa was was the most revealing thing we heard from the miked up today when he said that you know they're running every way we practice against 67 offense tenyard county replay first out and and part of that is Jon Gruden and kind of knowing that offense and knowing the philosophy and a big part of it is Monte Kiffin little defensive coordinator who always has his team ready to play I mean that given you look and you talked about a guy that has never drank decaf in his life who have always uh proposed you know coach it and taped it and has chairs and stuff out there that's what Monte Kiffin first intentionally run along after the linked up when we get a lot of publicity about it this week having the opportunity to mic up Lynch and my cup rice and I play it live we listen to it and then you know figure out what you can and can't hear Jerry took his michael off secondary's enough of this stuff yeah I think I think that's okay when you're when you're winning I think the stuff that goes on on a losing sideline and a losing bench is there's a lot of frustration that maybe they don't want you to hear nor do they want to hear themselves now on this side here this this is going to get better and a heck of a lot happier if they keep going this way second in 18 and the 23 when I asked is that a fairly silent go on a few times the play clock has gone and it's after the 27 yard line for Pittman you know John I begin to wonder sometimes what a certain people think I'm one of the runout what is Tony Dungy thinking what is Bill Parcells thinking what would John Mackay the late John Mackay have been thinking right now well I think John Mackay would be hack happy his act because the sudden Rich McKay is here and he really didn't want rich to go into football but if you're going to then go and put everything in it and do this Bill Parcells is probably thinking if I were going to go bad fine knew I was going to go back it's good I'd rather be here today than where I am and totally Dungy got asked to be angry if they just gave me one year one pretty bittersweet for Tony and who really molded this team and then watch Bruton get them over the top and there's a flag here's the third period as nine seconds left John McKay of course with an offside against open was the original coach after a great career at USC and out of the womb this team as an expansion team was Owen 26 offside defense number 55 yard penalty replay third down their report and of course Johnny McKay had the greatest of all lines no one won time after one of those losses before they said what do you think of your team's execution he said I'm all for it yeah yeah that was John McKay yeah they talked about guys with great oneliners and John McKay was that guy but I'll tell you another way I I played for John Mackay one and I knew him as a coach from a friend and he was a heck of it he was a brilliant football coach no question furnace snap on either side gets stopped here so the Raiders were able to stop him we'll get the ball back well you can tell what Jon Gruden is doing here he's trying to run time off the clock i mean he's got it and that's that's what he is and that's what he does i mean he gets a lead and then he sits on it and tries to run the clock out coaches talk about balance thirtyone running plays for tampa tonight thirty passing play and they're going to end up a lot of unbalanced run the rest of the game and that's exactly what the Raiders need of anything to get back in the game and it's taken into the endzone by Eric Johnson for a touchdown well well now he's not going to sit on that lead then we talk about momentum changers and somewhere you have to come up with a momentum changer and it usually comes on a special team play it can come under return it could come out of block this one here it comes on a block with number 51 you're going to see him right here he's the guy he gets is his right hand up Johnson gets his right hand up knocks it over doesn't catch the ball but they get it and have a convoy going into the end zone well the Bucs have their Johnson to Johnson and so to the Raiders Tim Johnson to Eric Johnson Tim Johnson tried to find it in Quinton and he was looking for it Eric Johnson found it that's what a special teams coach does after they get that play that does change a momentum it was Bob Casull Oh exalted on the sidelines to patoot have a punt block all season and now the Raiders will go for two the Raiders had a punt block last week I mean it wasn't a blind I mean the punt block was on the punter had to hold and they got the ball there and that was a momentum change for him last week against Tennessee so 14 16 remaining we've gone from 34 to 3 to 30 for 15 and maybe 17 the twopoint conversion and throws it out of the back of the end zone intended for Tim Brown so again they fail on a twopoint the margin is now 19 now the question arises John do you at this point attempt an onside kick no I would I would think not I would think if the Raiders were to kick an onside kick they play right into Tampa Bay's hands because if Tampa Bay were to get the ball here they could just keep pounding in a rock I think I'd kick them deep yeah what they need is a Korean brings it back and he gets tackled with the 23yard line and you can log on right now to Super Bowl Comcast your vote for tonight's MVP and then there is no at this moment clearcut choice but you would think if the game continues to go this way it has to be a Tampa Bay defensive player right because up until now they've really set the tone but as they say in golf there's a lot of golf left to be placed there's a football left to be played here there is but I think if if the Bucs want to go conservative I think that's why you want to kick them down here let them be conserved in here your position on alternate huge defensive stone for the Raiders here and it begins very nicely for Oakland as Pittman gets knocked down and finally the emotion you can see the emotion among the defenders well you can just feel it and you can even look across at their bench now and more players are starting to stand up they're starting to get into this game and and you wonder if it's just too much too late but but but now you can see that the Tampa Bay has to make a decision here do you want to stay conservative and play this this o'clock game here or you want to try and get first downs second and nine from the second to ten to the 24 yard line the cashier on Woodsen finally knocks him out of bounds but not until he picks up a first down there was no one out there on Keyshawn Johnson to corner blitz from that side and there was no one covering Keyshawn Johnson that was a heck of a thing by Brad Johnson to see that that he looks at corner comes off and Keyshawn Johnson was out there all by himself they get out here you see he sees the Blitz Charles looks at he comes because number 24 Woodson says he was a guy that was on Keyshawn Johnson so there was no one on Johnson and says what's the Nile it's no factor at all from the 42 yard line Anthony Dorsett first to hit him short game and you wonder about that play you wonder if the Raiders really needed that you know if they if they needed to bring that corner off the corner to give them that play and here's here's the play that I'm talking about is you just go you see the corner Charles Woodson coming from that side and there was no one out there at all on Keyshawn Johnson the closest guy being Rod Woodson that's a great point I mean strategically why did you sand the guy with a plate in his leg in that situation on a blitz I don't think they need to go second down and eight from the 44 yard line case by Cooper throws and that's incomplete third down because I'll tell you what that play did I mean that you know now it's time and it's field position and and those kinds of things and and it gave it gave the the bucks and better field position which if they do turn the ball over or do have to have a change of possession punted the Raiders field positions not going to be as good Chuck pres the hands defense trying to get the ball back at the tampa bay picked up a quick first down yes defense is all over himself going over because if any of his body parts are infallible Chris Cooper came across was he induced no Roach MIT 75 defense fiveyard pounded third down Oh baby you go from third and eight to third half three and this is another stupid what I mean here he is right here all you have to do is look at the ball and you don't move and tell the ball snap I mean there's no way that you can line up on the ball and do that you know I mean those those are things that as a coach or an extra drive you nuts that would drive you nuts yeah he's right there but balls right in front of me let's do is watch the ball going the ball thrown 34 they get pressure on John and close and with charles woodson covering on the play there is a flag on the play caught us off flag and now it's confirmed yeah there was a flag right there where Charles Woodson is and now they may say that the past was not even catchable they may take the flag away because it's not catchable pass interference 24 defense automated first stop Wow see if this is casual to begin with yeah you see here's key number card L and it's a little stop and go and what they do is a that's what they try to do to charles woodson and that ball was out of bounds oh man I mean it's not a casual ball now if they were going to call something but Brooke when that flag came out and he could have called holding maybe earlier after five yards but pass interference over there's no way right there unless they say that left hand that right hand up to the card L was passing the ball the ball is thrown out of bound absolutely if you're wondering sixteen he keeps that Skyler moon and finally pulls him down at the 11yard line and it started with those two penalties started with the offsides that gave him that third and three and then the pass interference penalty and now Jon Gruden is in the position that he wants to now again he could pound the rock he could just run at him he could run time off the clock because he has the field position to do it and that's exactly what he's doing get the ball out there to Pittman you'll get out there on that edge and I'd say this is one of the teams that pulls in a center watch Jeff Christie he's coming out here he's the center right here you see he not only pulls the right there he's going to get a block or he's going to miss a block right there but the Jeff Christy I think was one of the first centers driving goal and one of the better centers of the nine yard line and for the Raiders this is a nightmarish series and you start with it in ineffective corner blitz you then have a penalty that goes from third and eight to third and three you then have an interference call and you then have Pitman break one and the big thing was right after they had the momentum change I mean that was when they got back into the game with the punt block and the touchdown now their defense has to go out and do the job and their defense is kind of let them down second down and eight Hungary was in a rundas ghor for what's down stop with the 11 third down I was talking about Jeff Christie earlier is the I remember when he was the you know the allpro center from from Minnesota played for the Vikings there for years and I think when your dad Johnson started going and pass it in the offensive linemen better I think EMU is a pretty important foie gras for Austin he's taken down by genes so they'll have to settle for a grammatical field goal attempt of about 28 yards or so I think the way Jon Gruden is playing the game now it's a it's a game of clock it's a game of scoring and clock and and and rather than you forcing anything doing anything stupid here he wants to take as much time off that clock as he can and then take the field goal and just play from there and to take all the time off the clock they can't prior to this attempt 27 yards to the hole and it struggled is it your Permian in disguise no he just falls on it I'll bet you Jarrell came into his head at that point I bet you girl came into everyone's head at that point with Elise he just went down there was no way that he was going to throw that dramatical can't kick the field goal doesn't even have the opportunity and now Gannon at the 22 we receivers bunch to the left Jolley reaches to the first time with short second in one and the rate is gonna have to go quickly you know one of the good matchups today has been Warren Sapp against Frank Middleton Frank Middleton he'll played for Tampa Bay and they had know each other practiced against each other and one saps a lot quicker than Frank Middleton is but Frank milkers have put a tough back second one broken Wheatley coming out of the pack and Wheatley has the first alley maneuvered their way up to the 38 yard line I was looking at this plane it was just two plays ago and you can see what I'm talking about Middleton watch built it here on Sat he's going to either going to go and he gets a push and then she's going to grab around the neck just to bring it back in right Middleton Ezzor that you'd do anything you have to the guy in front of it but don't let him get to your quarterback injury timeout here Shelton Quarles the tanta line back there once the injured player Warren Sapp was telling us the other day he said you know he said I've been here for eight years and he said we laid some hard bricks and he said we want to win a Super Bowl and one of the big things he wants is he said you know they call Tampa Bay like Tampa Bay Tampa town he said I want a city he said it if we win the Super Bowl I want Tampa Bay to be called a city we want to represent a city and people to know it as Tampa because ever since you know they started getting a collection of sports teams they named they named it Tampa Bay the city is Tampa the area's Tampa Bay for what it's worth not much will be back injury tonight John went to Stanford as a as a quarterback was a pitcher there drafted by the Florida Marlins mention threw the first pitch panis began and his tip balls came out that's warren sapp tipping it you saw quarrels who was hurt he was assisted off the field and Natan Webster's in it linebacker for him here we talked about the Buccaneers in this in this base defense or what they've been doing all night is with the five defensive backs here's Ronde Barber again coming off the slot he's been on the slot all night which is really like a linebackers and they're playing like four defensive backs and the fifth defensive back Ronde Barber was playing at the weak side linebacker second and ten Jerry right but only up to the 41 yard line third down coming up on your 8 minutes remaining we talking about John Lynch and when he came in the league from Stanford and all that stuff and he said that Brad Culpepper told once he said remember Brad Culpepper he's to play defensive line for the buck he said you come into this league with a silver spoon in your mouth and you make it the NFL then you've done something he did it 37 from the 41 the kanji opened from barber and that's the first out of the 46 yard line you see the difference in pass protection or in no pass protection I mean earlier they're the whole game Gannon has had no protection and not been able to get rhythm and this last play and he has all kinds of protection and then you give rich can or any quarter back again FL this kind of time he's he is going is going to make completion from the 45 yard line barbar he got there just as the pass was released intended forgery right that's nice yeah they just disguise the silicon of Lyman back off everybody's coming from all these different angles yeah and that's and that's the thing that is so tough I mean here's here's a corner and he's coming from this position here and and I think that's a problem with playing free wide receivers and you bring nickel then nickel brings Londi Barbara as a slot corner and as a slot corner he is a great Blitzer from that back side just like that second down and that's incomplete and there is a flag down flag looks in the area of holding doesn't offensive holding holding 65 offense 10yard penalty replay second down Barry Sims well Jerry Rice limited to two grabs nine yards Brown caught that one pass early for a first down that was almost a highlight offensively of Oakland's first half so you have three catches to the two guys they'll each be a firstballot halloffamer for 18 yards and again part of that was coverage now they've just been playing that the nickel defense that soft cover two zone and the big part of it again with do what he wanted to do to get the barber racing ground second and 20 the Raiders have not run a single running has dictated that to the most part corner and he could sports that abound at the 48yard line that 13 yards shy of the first we were talking too bad Rich Gannon and how he throws the ball from different angles and here's that sidearm one yo where he has to do it he's getting a rush and he has to find Charlie garner and get a lane to it but you see he's looking here he's looking for his lane and he's going to find it out there to the right and as he sees it any answers were took after third and 13 open is rice touchdown whoa baby 48 yards wouldn't this be something update you again Jerry Rice is the inside receiver and he just runs right down this right we're talking about that soft zone is Jerry Rice he's going to come down and run a post he just runs right through the zone there's no bump for anything he has two safeties on either side of him he gets behind those two deep safeties and Rich Gannon hits them perfectly again it's at you why didn't you do that Sooners so it's 34 to 21 they'll try to shave it to 11 mm girl and as they're going to say no he was he was out judges they're saying no sir burgade and determine whether it was for staff but the back judge is emphatically saying uhuh and the back judged on Carys saying no sir and also there is a flag down again if the receiver if the receiver is up in the air and he is pushed out of bounds if he's inbound when he catches a ball and if his both feet are off the ground like that and he is pushed out then that would be a completed pass that that should be challenged going to check to see if this is even review about there it's not a flag what was thrown out is the challenge flag this this is actually not reviewable the act of forcing a player out of bounds is not reviewable one of the little crazy permutations and the Raiders are being told that right now and that is a crazy one because they put the instant replay in four boundaries yeah and to me this would come under the rule of boundary well they stret Biletnikoff going why but this is you know by rule you need review this if you could review that that would have been a twopoint play because if he's up in the air and would have been inbounds and is knocked out of bounds then that would be a point on the field that the receiver caught the ball inbounds will reveal the play well they can they can review that but we've already been told by Mike Pereira that they can't challenge a forceout so clearly he's out of bounds the Raiders are going to challenge I mean if this is the rule I don't know what they're challenging here because there's nothing to challenge you can't challenge the forceout part of it yeah but that comes up all the time al I mean that may say they can challenge things and they say they can't and then they always challenge things that they can't challenge sometimes don't challenge things that they can well we've already heard from Mike Pereira who is the head of officials who says you cannot challenge a forceout so thinking the challenge you came down in bounds clearly it's not even close he did not come down and bound and what you're doing here if you use the challenge is you're costing yourself a time out yeah but then Bill Carolla should have should have told Mike Bill Callahan he should have told Bill Callahan that that you can't challenge Forsythe absolutely I'd be surprised if he didn't because I mean that's part of what you have to do because if Callahan says I'm challenging that he was in bounds and Corollas got to tell him you can't challenge a forceout and I would be surprised if Callahan would would think that he was inbound right but so he if he's challenging he has to he has to say that he was forced out about after reviewing the play it was determined the receiver caught the ball in the air however he did not get inner feet inbounds therefore the play stands is called incomplete well I guess no go he didn't get either food inbound yeah six oh six remaining and again in checking with Mike Pereira the official bill Corolla would have told Bill Callahan you can't challenge the force a part bill wanting to challenge the fact that maybe he had come in so at that point you're what you're doing is you're challenging with your heart right and or someone told them to challenge and didn't know you couldn't challenge the course onside kick by Janikowski no that's a live ball yes it is not any longer Barra Williams down sit in the end zone I'll tell you if there's going to be any kind of miracle the Raider defense has to step up right now and make some plays and not allow a first down here first and 10 to the 20 yard line stop it on first down ticking through the middle stopped by treyvion schmidt and by here I mean this set it down but in this first second and third they have to have to stop them and get the ball back then they have to get a score then you can start you know talking about onside kicks and those kinds of things to mount all sports that leads don't mean what they used to remember basketball leave with me something baseball you get a seven or eight run lead football you get a cup of touchdown leave this looked like much to say about a halfhour of it this is Pittman and now it's third down can they stop in here third down and seven from the 23 yard line spot and that's a huge first down and that's the guy that you want to get the ball through out into flat if you need that first down because Alstott can get out there in the sideline and run it like a fullback and that's exactly what he does here you get him out in the flat you see he's the fullback they started on play fast here he comes out here he gets up now right now he turns into a fullback and he just knows where that marker is and he gets up past the marker and gets the first down right there after 32 37 plenty to think about if nothing else it's worth about two minutes to Tampa because that's about what it would take to run the three extra plays right and and Jon Gruden is going to do that and he's going to use all that time because you know he knows how to do these kinds of things and greater defense needed to play they didn't get it I'm not sure exactly what that timeout was either neither do I it looks like they're just getting tired I mean I don't know maybe they didn't have enough guys in there because the guys that they have in there right now across the two minute room second down in town from the 32 what's that treyvion Smith now we come up to another big third down play and the rate or the Raiders are going to take a timeout here as well so well it's Cooper and they did the same thing it's a second time I mean they took the timeout right after the play this time and the last third down they took the timeout right after the play I mean I'm still trying to figure out this utilization of timeouts here and I can't figure out any reason that they would have taken a timeout each time after a second down because I don't think was a substation thing and we'll wind the clock Oakland s to charge timeouts one remaining all right so what they've done here is they've taken since the injury superseded the timeout they can get the timeout back and they'll wind the clock and that's exactly what the case is like that's why I couldn't figure this out I mean look at a Cooper rolling around and say what are you taking a timeout for I thought they took the timeout before Cooper rolled around well maybe it was a Simon yeah the injury actually superseded the time actually get a break here then the clock it slammed down from 25 seconds here we go on 39 well still don't know why you wouldn't want to take the time out have they given you the time I have the defense great tackle by Eric garner and in comes the punting rule one of the things this year that has seemed fouled up in a lot of games to me is clock mannequin you know when using timeouts and using things you know when you when you didn't need them and then you get to the point at the end of the game when you really need them and then you don't have them if time runs out sure so right now they have one plus the twominute warning kupah had his last pump blocked fumble a snap on the field goal looking for the block you're the car he'd get there 22 Darian gordon looking for room nothing but red shirts that's 26 that's the problem with a punch lock when you don't get the punt block then you don't have any blockers downfield and you're really not going to get a return here comes Lynch here's the most recent miked up with John nothing cheap but we guys stay alive on the rush don't let him step up is what I'm saying no way they'll Venus if we don't give a hang up top and the rush is very important okay but they did give him something up on top and that was a Jerry Rice thing you know that's what Monte Kiffin just don't you keep the pass rush going don't let him step up don't give him anything up on top and they let Jerry Rice run right through the post on 74 yards in the end zone 244 Gannon the outside rice and have a bond shoved out right at the marker by Dwight Smith for catchers and the clock keeps running so they said that the play ended with a tackle in bounds first and ten from the 37 Gannon nobody home secondary does his job stop to the 38yard line trying to get a playoff before the twominute warning he had Jerry Rice or he had Jerry Rice open in the middle and didn't see him I think if the Raiders can get another first down here they can take another shot at the post because you can get in there on this defense down at the twominute warning now the ball is at the 38 yard line Tampa Bay up by 13 second down and nine upcoming for Gannon and the Raiders one Oakland timeout left I just had a vote for the MVP of the game out and Canseco I said okay we still have worse trailer we still have all that thing is probably not going to be the player I voted for anywhere she put it in pencil right put it until it's done for a second down and nine Gannon under pressure looked out from behind sack full loose Raiders recover at the 31 yard line but a huge blame ol challenge lines up with the football the Raiders still have it you know the first guy that flushed them out though we talking about flushing and making them move and get him out of the rigging was was it was Simeon rice and just watch here he's going to come from right here and you see again he just takes the inside on Simms and he goes right through Middleton there's right Pete this is going to write a finish Derrick Brooks who ran back three interceptions four touchdowns in the regular season does it to submit the Super Bowl well but there be a better way for the Buccaneers to put the ultimate exclamation point on it then the number one defense with the number one defender intercepting a pass and taking it to the end zone they're an Edward Derrick Brooks does that's what Rich Gannon was worried about he knows that you know that they just sit there and they squeeze things and the guy that squeezes things is Derrick Brooks he didn't get him till the last two minutes but he finally got him and that was right after I voted sweet him oh hey let me have that back I started to show you Simeon rice is who I voted for by the a bunch of guys on that side of the wall I think it has to be a defensive guy I mean they Mathieu was funny talked about this earlier we asked Jon Gruden you know who do you think is going to make the big play and win for you in the fourth quarter and he put my defense he said they'd like a great closer in baseball for pics of Ganon tonight and this is what they do so well I mean they're back now because they know they have to pass so so Brooks can get his death and again he's just watching the quarterback all the way so he just drops drops progress reads and then squeezes that's something you expect him to be out there in the left and when you throw the ball he ends up right in the middle of the field they think he's going to be out there by the numbers and he does that better than anyone he's out there by the numbers and then he squeezes in and that's where he gets his interception and the funny thing about it is is the Raiders knew that was going to happen Jon Gruden I think knew that was going to happen a year ago Gruden is the coach of the Raiders he has one year left on his contract remember Tampa Bay we mentioned before when Parcells spurned them they looked at Oakland first and it's my understanding the Raiders wanted about 15 million bucks and Tampa said no and then they went out and they as you look at the papers and the tshirts then they looked at Marvin Lewis did he sign them they looked at a couple of college coaches they went to Mariucci and then one of the things is when Mariucci was thinking about going to Tampa and Oakland thinks about the fact that Gruden plays of his contract and goes to San Francisco that I think forced the issue and Tampa and Oakland were able to come to an agreement with how Gruden would wind up going to flourite in the and the glacier family were really looking like they didn't know what the heck they were doing and they come out and they made this move and it was worth every penny I mean if if you could give those draft choices and that money to get this guy who could bring his team in this position and win a Super Bowl he is worth everything they pay him and everything they gave it looked like the Keystone Cops and now they're going to hoist the Lombardi Trophy in the field backed up to the 27 we pick up tomorrow's paper they will be the teepees and Warren Sapp is going to have something to say about that and I think that's the legacy that they were talking about it if we have a great defense we're not a great defensive cover win a Super Bowl we want a Super Bowl then we're all kinds of champions screams Rock well John it's they won't be long because you're going to be second on this list and there it is Bruton will become the youngest man to coach a Super Bowl champion you were a little bit more well forty and 3/4 years old 26 years ago well and congratulations to Jon Gruden because I know how it feels I mean in you know once I said in your life it's the best thing to ever happen just in your football life now and you will have forever jolly up to the 33yard line so still the youngest coach in the league here comes the bath that feels a little bit better tonight than it did last week in Philadelphia when that he got the bath and then he had to stand out there for about 12 more minutes yeah but I'll tell you another thing a Super Bowl bath is better there especially in San Diego rice by Corey ivy and so the Buccaneers did the NFC South Brad Johnson and one time Minnesota starting quarterback then he's Washington starting quarterback and remember had looked for all the world he was going to go back to Baltimore when he was a free agent a couple of years ago and sign with Brian Billick but they only offered him one year he said I've got to go down to Tampa starts with a defensive coach in Dungy then he gets bruton he says John just he's brought out the best in it has meant something when you waiting for I mean that's that's what when you get in this situation and it's going to be the best time of your life you really want to make a memory I think that's what Brad Johnson is doing right now I think that's what Harley and coaches and that's tip and that's a fifth pick of the game my blight Smith and again Dwight Smith is going to take it down the sideline into the end zone Wow just as I'm learning that Dexter Jackson has been named the most valuable player of the game for his toothpicks white Smith gets his second and his second touchdown now DeLeon he's playing because again that's a defense if the Bucks played this whole game was was four defensive linemen two linebackers five defensive back and Dwight Smith was that fifth or extra defensive backs so what do we do have a recount Rick esenberg back up over bladesmiths now but I think I mean I still stay with with mine I mean Dexter Jackson and congratulations to him and and everyone but but but this thing was won and controlled by the defensive line that's it was that's where that's where it all started for this buck team and I know it's Florida and I know it's hanging chads and all that stuff but Jackson's toothpicks were hugely important I mean this is just this is a cosmetic pick right here by Smith yeah but and and my guy simulates didn't make it did it for tonight my god I mean he raised havoc the whole game I mean the big thing he did he worked over there and Barry Simms and he gave him a speed rush but the thing that I liked about it he took the inside a lot today and when when Simeon rice takes the inside he reminds me a lot of Charles Haley you know Charles Haley was was one of the best natural pass rushes I've ever seen because he would always take the inside hard dramatic jump did you see that already jump that hurt his knee and he wasn't jumping anymore you know he'd just go through through a little celebration that's everything what the heck he jump one more Mike desam gentlemen here it is so sedate when you see him and all this sign yeah you know that ol oxymoron clean dirt that's what I'm legit and then out in the field he's a wild man easily hit her he's all those things and Jon Gruden like I says you have it and you'll have it for the rest of your life and they can never take it away from them Malcolm Glazer and
