============================================================

NBC Sports welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League and now to utter America would you please rise and remove your hats performing tonight's national anthem please welcome Miss America second runnerup and Monroe native Miss Louisiana Holly watch first were so gallantly streaming I had a black lost you there oh say does that starspangled the land great rendition of the anthem on this great American holiday Thanksgiving 2018 two games in the books in this rivalry to go as we get set for kickoff let's go back downstairs and once again here's Michele Tafoya well Mike at four and six the Falcons find themselves a mustwin territory and because four of the six losses have come by one score the team is focused on one particular or this week coach Dan Quinn told us we've got to keep pushing for that closer mentality some of the lessons had to come through losses but that's the difference between being good and great closing gains on both sides of the ball but the Saints haven't had that problem they've scored at least 45 points in each of their last three games drew Brees told us what he likes best about this team is that they know how to have fun and winning is fun and Mark Ingram told me everyone on this team wants everyone else to succeed he said no one is selfish and when you have that on a team they have something special Mike and it is real you can feel it as we are around the Saints yesterday Michele Carolina lost in Detroit last Sunday so the seats are up three in the division with six To Go they play the Panthers two of the last three weeks as we show us alluding to Atlanta doesn't get this they're not gonna have a meaningful December lot on the line here today Sean Payton seems gonna get the ball first Atlanta won the toss and deferred so they are thrilled to get their offense rolling right away and I totally disagree with this maybe he's trying to show confidence in his defense but if I'm the Atlanta Falcons I've worn my offense on the field coach trying to make a statement and quiet down his corrupt is proud Taysom Hill back deep to receive this opening kickoff from Matt foster picture half at us home off we go the line drive kick he'll take it his hands on and let's meet the New Orleans Saints offense drew Brees Boilermakers Mark Ingram Alabama Alba c'mere the University of Tennessee Michael Thomas the Ohio State Benjamin Watson Jordan Taysom Hill BYU Jamal bushra Towson University Andrew speed Stanford max Unger foreign player Warford University of Kentucky Bryan ramjet Wisconsin actually gonna start with a sixth offensive lineman Michael Ola number 65 will be eligible here to start that's what New Orleans does they throw you a little bit of everything they're gonna test you out yep right away with the tackle this is just a lead right up the gut camara is a great inside runner that's a great lead block but Alvin Kamara even though he looks like a little guy he runs so well inside a team on that opening game and he has such versatility here he comes at the bottom of the street lined up as a receiver Arnold who has wide receiver type skills he'll gain not to have Brees when he played Atlanta in that first game combined for five touchdowns ran for two through three and had an 80% completion percentage essentially in that game that's right around his average he's having a remarkable season and Drew Brees told us yesterday they have 50 different personnel groups up for this game and you can see what Sean Payton is doing showing different looks on every play here on this opening drive second down from Mara again 239 two strong runs for alvin kamara averaging four and a half a carat once left guard Andrus Pete here he's going to start the doubleteam and come up on the linebacker it's two guys great job and again alvin kamara inside is like a knife right and the Falcons have these small linebackers so they're running directly Adam clearing them out Greensboro's completes of Michael Thomas's favorite receiver to the 34yard line he's second in the league Thomas and receptions that was his 83rd in the third year man who won a championship at Ohio State third and receiving yards yeah I was just so impressed with him yesterday when I saw him in practice he he didn't he didn't drop any passes Mike a lot faster than what you think and Dumont 8kz you know said hey he respects his guy safety for the Falcons got his hands full Taysom Hill checks in for the Saints for the first time tonight leads that Falcons defense with the stop here is the Atlantic crew on T the Beasley klimt graded year Clint Jack Crawford Penn State attacking Kenley UCLA for yellow again yo Devon Jarrett Campbell Minnesota Desmond truth huh Washington demotic ad San Diego State surah nisa Florida Atlantic Robert offer Southeastern Louisiana Brian Poole dvu floor second poorest read on third down less far this year in the league only Cincinnati worse 37 here more the pepperonis in the middle it's a first down with Thomas for the 28th this opening drive continues you saw what the Falcons are trying to do to head three defensive ends they swing around Vic Beasley and it inside the drew brees sees the opening in the defense and gets rid of the ball Mike yes Mike Thomas has this just option rod he's going to run away from the linebackers sit down against zone defense they're so precise tough to handle him in zone Julio Jones wait for his turn it might be down seven not the wagon injured week two debated this week in the lineup once snap on the field won't touch down and might they put him at the three spot in the slot and he runs across the linebackers face inside of Demonte KZ and we watched him in practice they ran this same play had a lot of successful playaction just held the linebackers slightly in time so fast let's add to the extra point as if he needs another cousin throw it to career touchdown number two for Tommy Lee Lewis he had one last year and the third year man from Northern Illinois he's got a whole Thanksgiving gift seven ugly Sunday night football on Thanksgiving night is brought to you by Walmart lightup Christmas at Walmart by Toyota let's go places and by simply safe home security to protect your home and your huge yesterday dawn Busters Kiwanis Club hosted their annual turkey Brett fizzled nine hundred turkeys two local community all the proceeds go to charity and service projects these around the country those who need this special time will let's kick off will be a touchback Matt Ryan and the Falcon offense takes over at the 25 and here they are Matt Ryan Boston College Tevin Coleman Indiana University Julio Jones Alabama Mohamed Sanu rocklers Calvin Ridley BAM Austin Hooper Stanford Jake Matthews Texas A&amp;M Weston Schwarzer San Jose State Alex Mack count Ben garland Air Force Academy Ryan straighter office to go against the 11 states defenders at 70,000 in this crowd tonight for stab runs heaven Pullman to the left plus they are Demario Davis on the tackle and home where communication was easier in week 3 bat Ryan lit it up five touchdowns no picks three of them to the first round rookie Calvin Ridley out of Alabama fascinating to see how New Orleans will match up against Ridley Julio Jones and company here tonight second down first throw riot traffic was great hands those red gloves of Julio Jones snatches it out of the air first down Atlanta we see something interesting here Mike Eli Apple on Julio Jones and they're using the safety to help out but Julio finds the open spot here Apple doesn't take a lot out of med the line of scrimmage and they're taking their best corner Marshawn Lattimore and putting him 101 with Calvin Ridley it's a little different from the first game something we'll see as Atlantis notices that if that's the trend tonight how they adjust first down throw Julio broken up cool in coverage so you saw exactly what Tony told you then we're going to get and he doesn't right there Apple covering of the safety helping up yeah and they felt like he knew I Apple was an upgrade at the cornerback position great job just taking on a challenge mantoman and and making a play that bump conference looks like he's got free access safety over there late better throw that balls a completion where's Cole came over from the Giants a month ago when actually played against it went on knighting was traded goes to the sideline for a second in ten nowhere to go heating William to the flag down named submarining down to knock them down a Jay Klein hit him up high into the first time tonight John Hussey the call trying to get stomped Payton's attention see if he wants to flag or not third and 11 or second 20 plus illegal block in the back offense number 17 her down here is the New Orleans defense Cameron Jordan UC Berkeley Tyler Davison Fresno State children or engines rule Alex Okafor texas new mario davis brandon high school alex Angeloni florida reliable the ohio state university bond bill the Ohio State Marcus Williams University of Utah marks a lotta more at the ohio state university pj wounds state all those TVs out there for thirty tip and Ryan throws complete Mohamed Sanu across midfield at a first down into the fortyeight Rodney that's a guy you want to see Atlanta get more involved in the offense tonight absolutely Mike every time he gets an opportunity because of his size and he's a lot quicker than what you think he is for a six for wide receiver and he's going to be matched up against PJ Williams I feel like this is a matchup that they can definitely exploit data 15 for sinew played some quarterback high school Wildcat quarterback at Rutgers started his career with the Penguins third year with the family couple tight ends in for Atlanta first and 10 good opening drive for riot then alone up shock for some news open brings it in to the 11 yard line sanu got the Stepan Lattimore the safety help couldn't get there a gain of 37 and just like I talked about now you have Marshawn Lattimore their best corner in the slot he doesn't feel very comfortable in the slot and like I just said Matt Ryan has a lot of confidence in Mohamed Sanu he's a lot faster than what you think he is welldesigned bootleg action to the right normally everything goes to the right but now this is back across fields to new runs away from the outside technique that's what you said in the open Rodney there's no fear factor New Orleans came down scoring and lastly it's fine you want to go shootout we got the guys to do it Matz feels very confident in his offense in his weapons this is the area though the red zone Coleman hopped outside one of the best in the league Cameron Jordan was there to shut the door on the running back Cameron Jordans standing up on the outside and he does a great job here taking on this block and coming off he's a Rodney a twoway player he doesn't just rush the passer he plays run also Mike I think he's the most complete defense in the National Football League because he plays the run with the same passion to get his defensive coordinator Dennis Allen agrees with you best end in the league second and 15 the pattern for riot shot the minute Julio Jones rarely targeted in the red zone gets one there and gets to the three yard line it'll be third and two incredibly just the seventh time they throw to Jones in the red zone all year yeah Mike but I'm looking at Ryan should Schrader and he's at he struggled with against Cameron Jordan in the past but just enough push to get him behind him again at that extra time that was a great shot by Julio Jones just finding the open spot against that double coverage to for the first down three for the touchdown Julio's oneonone you got to go down right step 3 over the pile we'll see if the Falcons got on it sakes think they have it and this is just what Dan Quinn talked about by finishing great drive down there you get in close they can finish Ryan rises up to throw it just a quick minute for Marcus Williams knocked it out big turnover for Atlanta the safety Marcus Williams says showing up in the spot Matt Ryan didn't expect him Tony yeah and this is a running play Austin Hooper's gonna come in and block Marcus Williams for the run Matt Ryan wants to throw the ball of Julio Jones but you can't effectively get that block on a pass Matt Ryan is not a rookie quarterback he has to see the two guys blitzing into a gap and he has to he has to change it from a run play to a pass play and you can read his lips he's where did he come from he came running right in the center guard gap Austin Hooper couldn't get two in for sack for Williams's second year in the league second red zone turnover for the Falcons you can't afford that against the Saints to work to the 13 complete Desmet Trufant breaks it up on the pass intended for michael thomas that is rare breezed to Thomas has been the best possible Daily Double you could find in football this year and that was well done by Trufant competing going with him on the crossing route staying after him he's giving up at least four inches too because what this kid is huge second and ten Mark Ingram Knapp running back three comes back to the 2009 the winner we'll keep those legs churning and fives before for yeah lookin could make the tackle so briefs has a touchdown and an opening drive it's 26 touchdowns and one interception no one's ever thrown that many touchdowns in the history of the league 99 years with one or fewer in ourselves once in your life you want to stay for a while we could teach you a lot of football history with Drew Brees and Sean Payton's especially breezed in the incredible bubblers he has hit inside the ten what is he down by contact or not will be the key thing to look at Zermatt akz takes it all the way for the touchdown for the moment conversation here with John husky the referee and one of the other officials and really for the life of me I don't look at the cornerback and he was grabbing and holding the wide receiver I thought it should have been a flag but great break on the ball by the mahkumat akz he had five interception six is an interception the defender was knocked down by contact on the 39 yard line we will place the ball in the 39 open to 10 Atlanta the correct call trips over the leg of Keith Kirkwood the rookie out of temple and then comes down so it is a turnover no flag thrown and Brees intercepted for the second time because of injury dumontet KC's become a starting safety for the Falcons six ints leads the league again he started the day with a lead lead lead lead Balfour from Chicago got one of the into the game of Detroit to get to five without KZ gets his sixth after the rare turnover by both teams Falcons get it back to the 39 and here is Ryan in the middle of the field it's a new again complete to the 23 yard line let's go back to the coverage on that interception throw by marina really felt like the Falcons got away with one right here Brian Poole just grabbing restricting the wide receiver this should have been a pass interference call right here Terry McCauley or three times Super Bowl referee in the booth yeah Mike absolutely personal the defenders not playing the ball he reaches out he was materially restricts that we see his ability to move toward the football this should have been defensive pass on the franchise ride and said from the 23 going back to the air just gets rid of it they have that screen cover this Cameron Jordan healed off low five from the cypher shadowing Tevin Coleman Cameron Jordan is such a smart player he feels this screen comes off rather than continued to rest the pass and reads it right now no place to go with the ball can't teach that mic so smart so good if people always talk about Pro Bowls I was looking like to look at the All Pro list best to the best regardless of conference allpro defensive end last year on his way to that title again this year second in ten Coleman quickly much there is read well by Demario Davis the linebacker for the st. so slant Atlanta is run at first doesn't plays her so gets Steve Sarkisian a feel for how New Orleans is defending him today Sarkisian former head coach at USC and at Washington second year with the Falcons your playstyle Shanahan which a man went to San Francisco and they'll be matching play calling with Dennis Allen bowler head coach in this league with the Raiders has been with some paint here the last couple of years ago on this side 21 points allowed last two games third and nine complete to Wrigley and they're working at Alabama got both feet down first down Atlanta at the 11th this is the matchup that New Orleans is confident with their best corner Marshawn Latimer on Ridley with no help grilling outside release and this is a great timing pass by Matt Ryan 40 catches on the year 702 touchdowns tight formation at the 11 they run Kuhlman inside crawls forward for 5 to the 6 Vaughn Bell who's seeing a lot of snaps at safety basic tackle yeah I really like Vaughn Bay I think he's an underrated player they talked about his versatility playing in a deep half of the field and also coming down defendant tight ends and here to throw the ball Mike Matt Ryan knows he's got oneonones away from Julio let's see where he goes Cameron George who rarely comes out out on this Nanomech over to my Apple and Ridley lining up releasing for the backfield brian scanning looking nothing they're chased the ball got it back sheldon Rankin's into mario davis closed in on the Falcons quarterback davis knocked it out he recovers for third down well you look at Matt Ryan and you see why he's so frustrated he doesn't know where to go with the ball because his defensive backs of the Saints have done a wonderful job of just defending and plastering these guys he has nowhere to go they did he wanted to go away from Julio Jones he had the one on once that they were covered for the first time tonight ito Smith rookie out of Southern Miss is in the backfield to the left hip Orion on third 13 Jones incomplete Eli Apple covering it'll be a field goal attempt for the Falcons and this is double coverage with Eli Apple and the safety comes over late and I'm gonna tell you he's doing a really good job on Julio Jones he's getting up in his face he's jamming them and this is a lot of this is this builds confidence in a young cornerback mic especially a guy to struggled as much as Eli Apple has struggle with a confidence in his time of the Giants that Bryant 843 third oldest player in the league of 32yard field goal attempts it's three games of the hamstring injury told me on the field before the game feeling pretty close to 100% knocks it through and the Falcons are on the board worth stayed up tonight tonight's show the one and only Jerry Seinfeld animals with Robert Irwin and a surprise visit from Bob Dylan who almost never does TV what a great night to stay up sneak that little extra piece of pie that's put in the refrigerator put that stuff in my body Mike I know you don't but everybody else says you got talent you got Seinfeld you've got Bob Dylan Tonight Show coming up later on here on NBC gonna hold on to it before they take over 25 some Thanksgiving musings from the quarterbacks I love just about every aspect of the Thanksgiving meal from the turkey to the mashed potatoes to the gravy that's probably one of my favorite things is the gravy that you're basically smothering over everything my favorite dish on Thanksgiving other than Turkey has to be stuffing it's really the only time of the year I eat it and so that's probably my favorite thing quarterbacks just like everybody else well that gravy love that stuff most of the players who play on Thanksgiving look forward to that Thanksgiving meal with their families tomorrow like three six three six seats leaving seven three taste of elf back on the field as his third drive begins from the 25 Camaro big one to start the game this carry before Jordan Richards makes the tackle he was the offensive Rookie of the Year last year he scored a touchdown his last five games I don't even know Sean Payton knew what he was getting when they took him in the third round at a Tennessee a couple of years ago oh and Sean told us yesterday he wanted to see how they were going to treat certain personnel groups especially with Taysom Hill they could get some inside running against that nickel defense he gets 13 Mark Ingram comes in he'll gain two yards Tony what does it do to a defense into a coordinator when you have these two backs as unique as the skill set is of Samara and the band right there Margate really is difficult to defend because you've got the power running of Ingram and the playaction passes and then camara you don't know is he going to be in the backfield as he flanked out and it really is a problem it's the challenge for more Kuantan manual second gears defensive coordinator was the secondary coach here with Atlanta was elevated a couple years ago Dan Quinn of course has his hands on the defense for Murphy Alvin Kamara in the slot they are treating him like he's a wireless use it right now which is rare for the first down the Markham out of bounds at the 48 yard line of the Falcon and this is the play this was going to be a fake jet suite to camara and a pitch to Ingram breeze even though he fumbles the snap he's got enough composure hey was this carry this out get the ball out to mark and still make the play work drop the snap with Singh's offense rolls 38 points a game just under that highest scoring punch in the lead through the hole to the 43 yard lines we get to the back end of this opening quarter with a Devon Drake ample tackle for it loud interesting quarter both teams moved the ball Falcons bogged down in the red zone a couple of times as they got to the New Orleans three in the New Orleans seven and two teams to take care of the ball very well have mishandled it supposed to see these quarterbacks not handle the ball well yes a couple of fumbles to Ryan Brees with a mishandled snap there and a pick after one on Thanksgiving night New Orleans seven Atlanta three and Sunday night football on Thanksgiving night continues after these messages tonight's aerial coverage is brought to you by Geico you look down canal central business district great city of New Orleans back on its feet and thriving after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 and so many folks from Atlanta down here to enjoy Falcons st. of Thanksgiving I'm Mike Tirico Tony Dungy Rodney Harrison Michele Tafoya on the field second and five to start the quarter breeze looking deep it was covered and he is sacked thrown down Tech McKinley reaching around to get sacked six and a half on the year yeah this is tack McKinley you just see the speed rush around the corner forcing him up inside to LA one of his defenders to come up and make that play Sean Sean Payton was taking his shot here two tight ends and wanted to get that deep all the Michael Thomas but that was well played it was mcclain 99 at McKinley 98 were sack for the veteran and a south bar that makes third and 11 for New Orleans and a threeman rush it has the yardage on the forward progress to the 37 yard line for the first down michael thomas runs a beautiful route and he's just so good against zone coverage he's trying to find that open space looks outside no the open spaces inside he and brazier on the same page but you see drew brees looking off looks to the left side he comes back to the right side of you're defending Michael Thomas you got to get up in his face Marcus Trufant Desna to fine he's just 13 yards off just too far nenechan they look play action shop plays here here's another five hegemon watson and his hands on it look like he who's going to turn and go to the goal line but Jordan Richards does a good job to take it out of there this is for verticals to tight ends right down the seam and all the breeze is doing is looking at that free safety Watson gets a great release breeze looks the pre safety off puts him right on his hands you you have to catch that you have to kiss that that was so well done by Brees here he looks the safety away knows right where he's going that's my former teammate make some question for Brees you don't see many of those touchdowns or Drew Brees one yard line a penalty marker down south and city coming back hold it a second down interesting start to this one guys so you thought so far toward well the Saints you know Sean Payton has a lot of personnel groups a lot of things he wants to see I would write myself a note if I were him three wide receivers Alvin Kamara I can run inside don't forget about that and I'm looking at the Falcons Matt Ryan in particular he needs to just relax he's played in big games before calm down he seems a little bit nervous two fumbles inside the red zone he has to play better and take care football might be some of that pressure of we got to score touchdowns when we get down here but he's the same guy who played in the Super Bowl had a lot of success he just needs to relax this moment is not too big from that many think Brees is the favorite to do the MVP this year with the back end of the play clock on second and 20 Thomas eggs on didn't go down two more yards out of it this is an unbelievable throw and drew talked to us about this how do I get completions when everybody is covered everybody is covered and he finds Michael Thomas in the middle of the field but I like about him when I saw him coach he is a big big receiver he's not afraid to come across the middle he'll sacrifice his body 63 64 what a what a great catch by this young man who just stepped around bought enough time and says I can put this up high and I trust my receiver we'll go up and get it so that knee teeth come down we marked it in the proper spot at the 34 so it's third and seven five in the pattern Tamara gets the first down so smooth turning it up field in front of Isaiah Oliver and you got a first down at the 25 we talked about Brees and Michael Thomas and their success the completions already today add those up targeted 95 times 85 completions to Thomas 89% highest completion percentage are any duo in the league in the last 20 seasons I mean it's really remarkable it's almost 9 out of 10 times he was a Thomas and to complete at all they cover him I why don't they double cover my Tony said they had him covered there it was a collision with right here the 15 for the first down we'll see if it is here's Michelle well I asked Michael Thomas about his extraordinary connection on the field with Drew Brees and he said it's taken time a lot of repetition and communication and he said if they make a mistake in practice they will repeat the play immediately and try to build muscle memory Thomas also likes to think he and Brees share some personality traits they just certainly both are always on and on the same page of the show quickly these seats tried to run to the line and get a play in but we have a whistle that first was a good job by some because that was an illegal so they somebody lined up wrong it was illegal for me yes they're lined up wrong both wide receiver in the tight end we're off the ball they were gonna snap it and get a penalty Sean stopped it down here at the bottom of the screen it looks like it's Josh Hill enob Hill and Michael Thomas both off the line of scrimmage that was going to get called as an illegal formation Sean Payton did a good job stopped it save five yards tell you one thing Mike he sees everything gain I think being it his practice is definitely an adventure he gets into it it was eyeopening for you yesterday absolutely he's got a lot of energy absolutely very smart coach reminded me of my year I played for bill walls he just dissected everything talked about every position where you're gonna be plays we're gonna dial up for you it was great Mike fight for we ready second in one heap Ronald Ronald outofbounds 12 yard line well it planters numbers have been good they have been hurt in such key spots some of their best players are out with injury and it's showing especially in the run game they are second to last in the league in yards per rushing tonight a couple of big hits already has that number much higher than Dan Quinn would hope lost both of his starting safeties Michelle told you the beginning Deon Jones perhaps the best player the linebacker in the middle play a little canoe has been in there for Jones and playing better at a Yale made the tackle and this is the thing that really makes him special I mean he gets the ball looks like it's nowhere to go and he just makes a couple little moves and he gets that extra hidden yardage I mean he is really amazing to watch this was an inside run he bounced it outside then spin move makes five yards where there was nothing there at the point of attack you so many things of them those receiver skills line Olympus essentially receiver here up the middle beside the five before greeting Jarrett impact player in the middle of that line for the Falcons makes the tackler forces a big third down here about a third of the way through this game and what's so tough here is the Saints can do anything because Sean Payton is so willing to go for it on fourth down so you could see playaction take a shot here they don't have to just run it in there and pound it up and get the first down watch this kid Dan on he's up the very top of the screen it's over ready for the second year sign it out of division 332 Sharon Eastman helped out the safety getting an opportunity because those injuries back there for the Falcons big play and like you said Tony fourth down sometimes they'll go here they'll go for the field goal yeah he's a he's a big guy and he he just does a slant route and the Falcons safeties have struggled hits him right in their hand but great job up nice but you got to give him a lot of credit swiping at the ball and this is something that they teach mark and Manuel and Dan Quinn thanks to the job on the strip there's will Lutz who in college was at Georgia State in Atlanta he's been on our wall here to be his one this year he's just in 22 yards tapas more stead the punter is the holder ten once not sit through ten three New Orleans Sunday night football on Thanksgiving night is brought to you by Microsoft Surface and by Hyundai official sponsor of the NFL some in our open with emerald Trombone Shorty giving us a great rendition of the sunday night football theme the drew Brees and Britney breeze so they're like the first couple of New Orleans they're so funny Billy up there one of their kids Balin and bring somebody to school then right bring your a Trombone Shorty down a bread it's good to have friends like that some of the best musicians in the world that New Orleans can give you so it's pretty sweet what's kickin Marvin Hall favorite foods for this Thanksgiving this that I'm looking forward to and what I like to get after really is macaroni that's my favorite food for me I do the macaroni and cheese you know I'm saying so I get it right favorite dish besides Turkey was probably having a pecan pie you know you gotta get the hot sauce on the collard greens and get the stuff and mix it all together and chow down so other two dishes I definitely after everybody's got their favorite Tony favorite Thanksgiving dish for you I've got to be the yam yam sweet Bobby potato salad potatoes potato salad the 25 here is Ryan and get into the hands of Julio on the Endora and genomes well played strung out by that New Orleans defense only a gain of a yard you guys see these receivers on the regular basis around the league Julio Jones one of the elite ones always in the top three in receiving yards in the National Football League it seems he is such a threat big man with great speed and I just love his attitude he goes half to the football he is great I like to see him get more opportunities in the red zone rarely targeted down there as we alluded to in that first quarter second and ninetyfour Ryan and the Falcons trouble will be brought down if his Sheldon breakins getting inside a careerhigh sack seasoning now has seven this is one place where they felt they had an advantage the Saints with Sheldon ranken's against backup guard Ben garland or second team guard damn just with this one move he's hard to handle in there again this a team that lost both of their starting guards this year and that interior pressure and some twists have bothered Ryan third and 14 that's got time here takes that shot blanket coverage right through the arms of Ridley and incomplete and dropped in the bucket Calvin Ridley from being a tough time seeing it the Falcons are left to pumped it away a really good job by Marshawn Lattimore just stand with it they beat him on this play in the first game it was out of the great job of just trying to get his head back around trying to locate the ball sky by running to a lot of contact as well first punt of the game it's Matt washer gets it away no flag as he goes down to the 35 yard line here comes Camaro got a step down at the 42 yard line Peter great throw such an important part of this Atlanta defense Dion Jones as Michele Tafoya told you at the top of the game very close to coming back with a foot injury but didn't Quinn the coach said I didn't want to just get him out there at when he's ready I want to make sure that he's completely ready he's a longterm part of this team before did they miss that long four different defense with him out there they lose a lot of speed the leadership that he provides and one thing that the Falcons have struggled with all year has been tackling in the open field and he's a heck of a tackler this game means so much to him from New Orleans went to Jesuit High School great high school in the area Saints fourth possession starts at the 42 in camara around the edge a bounce after a half dozen so Jones is one of the big injuries in this season this big part of reason Atlanta is only sitting on four wins Devonta Freeman half their running back tandem out both of the guards Fusco and levitra out with seasonending injuries I mention the two safeties Keyon O'Neal or Cardo Allen the young core of this team really damaged and Jones now missing game 10 on the season with that foot injury inside two running back two guards linebackers and safeties right up the gut they've been hit with injuries later mark more than four and six have been in other games as well the Chinese first down bitch chuffing Brian Poole that's what Rodney does as we watch games every Sunday before football night there's a big hit from a safety and Rodney oh I like that kid down on oh he's a former wide receiver they made him into a tight end he's big and he can run Wisconsin Platteville a division three player who's come on and played but those safety he gave those out for many years just I put myself in a moment which like now you don't have everything else go when you hit them during your great career the 42 yard line it's so fun to watch this Saints offense their guys four guys in three guys in back and forth who's gonna be in the game it puts so much pressure on the defense the matchup yeah pretty fun to watch Taysom Hill come up in there and block the lunges strong safety I love that kid that's what you're talking about 20 yeah it's like watching a hockey game line change yeah three in three out and as defense of those interesting with Dan Quinn says well they're bringing Hill in and now you're identifying what he's doing it slows you down because you have to be a little more basic so he's communicating and you know here on fire it's not like Atlanta is a very exotic team in first world complete Robert Alfred come in from all angles for pass interference the first accepted penalty on the falconer parents alfred started to stumble and then he reached out sixteen yards on the penalty and we'll take it to the 26 yard line you know we were talking in the break before how lucky Atlanta got earlier LC offered like 20 mistakes stumbling and just oh yeah there's a bitch come on to Camaro the turn of the game of a couple of yards Ronnie you're no longer the feel you can't negotiate with Terry we'll call the on penalty calls B gonna help poking like a defense to me pull the guy down no they shouldn't call what does he know he's only beneficial for twenty years you know guys are thinking about Dan Quinn's team here they turned it over once fumble the ball in the red zone on defense they held the Saints to a field goal got a rare interception from Greece they'd have opportunities to stay in this game they can't mess around here they really have to be careful at this point this sort of big series got of course another field goal here start with their quarterback Matt Ryan twenty four threes its increment size of four to the 20yard line Vic Beasley who only had one sack and that came in the New Orleans game in Week three had to last week they need him to ring the bell a little bit more this season you look at the center max Unger and this is a terrific block against a really good player Grady Jarrett just clearing them out the way strong safety goes in there and he just misses yeah Ryan you talked about they're tackling sera Denise knows right in the hole you got to make that tackle and make it a third wrong three wide receivers running against his nickel he can run inside this is just a college zone read but you've got small linebackers in there people trying to rush the passer camara can find those holes I like this Sean keep coming back to that inside run with Tamara out of the three wide look yeah a lot of credit to that offensive line just getting up the field getting on top of those linebackers run it more than they've thrown it Tamara and Ingram effective to 12 first down to Orleans Austan car we saw this in practice yes we need a copilot take your time set this up we're going to make it look like run you'll be wide open like you talked about Oscar car he's in there like he's gonna block safety looks in the backfield he even food's the corner and just once again just sneaking out there if we put so much attention on Michael Thomas and all these other weapons Alvin Kamara you forget about Austin car Luntz that's it so here the Saints grow on 40 points a game going through touchdowns tonight Tommy Lee Lewis Austin Carr the plate design execution magnums very special edition of the Toyota halftime show peter king traveled close to coast with Steve Gleason more determined than ever to fight ALS dirty Steve his family coming up at halftime there is Steve that's what Michelle rivers his sons a great part of the feature as well to see that coming off that block the return from Katrina game in 2006 a moment I'll never forget when the loudest stadiums have ever heard Greece's story once a sheriff will do it Cameron Jordan with the pressure on third down and I love this Dennis Allen news ligo's aggressive he fakes the Blitz comes out in zone and he trusts his defensive front for to get the president I tell you this this is one of the most underrated players in National Football League sheldon Rankin's this guy's unbelievable nice little spin move right there putting pressure and that's what they talked about putting pressure on that line and getting them off that spot 13th time the Jordan has sacked Ryan in his career so it's fourth down New Orleans took a timeout they want to get the ball back Atlanta has left their offense out of the field now they say because it got to be aggressive is this too aggressive no Dan Quinn talked about this hey we've got to make some things happen we've got to steal some possessions I'm not surprised to see Mohamed Sanu that cannot go through if you don't get this in the same it might be ballgame fourth and seven they're going to go for it Brian scrambling can he get there yes he does put it in the left hand before he came across the sideline a huge conversion off fourth down I like to call and Dan Quinn talked about this yesterday we cannot win this game by playing conservative and what and one thing I've noticed Mike about Matt Ryan he's predetermined in who he wants to go to he's staring at his receiver he's not survey in the field he has to start surveying and feel and really trusting his instincts all time gutsy close where the ball is when it crosses the sideline really sharp to get in the left hand get an extra yard take any doubt out of the equation the 44 about 45 to go remember deep comes under down below minimal gain of to great job again Dublin Julio this was a play accent trying to get getting him on a deep crossing Rob the day the safety cutting yeah this is Julio like you talked about on deep crossing route the free safety comes out the middle the cornerback goes to the deep half and Calvin Ridley somehow they got to find a way to get him in the game he's not even running a full round he's got to get it to the game right second and eight Ryan scans comes back to the middle we seen that a lot from his office this year Austin Hooper the tight end with the kids first to the night 51st of the year under a minute remember now Atlanta gets the ball to start the second half so they want to do the full belly check here score halftime get the ball back that's how they're gonna get back in the game still up possessed and Tony even if they get a field goal on this Drive 17 6 it just stems the momentum a little early yeah you're not gonna beat for the Saints kick and fill those like I know it sounds good thirtytwo five of the pattern the first down with Ito Smith at the 31yard long time out now yes to two remaining in field goal range Atlanta on the move 26 seconds till the half welcome to the Toyota halftime let's go places Atlanta driving trying to get within seven but Alex Angeloni comes up with a big hit on Julio Jones knocks it out seats recover and they lead by 14 as we welcome you to the Toyota halftime and we extend our Thanksgiving wishes once again to all of you at home this Saints franchise has had just a great surge over the last dozen years or so you remember back in the early days there wasn't a lot to be excited about what Saints football but they did win a Super Bowl here's some nine years ago but in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina this was a very special season at a very special team and the most memorable moment from that year is what Steve police have blocked a punt in the first game back here after Katrina as you may know Steve is battling ALS right now seven years into that fight yet he is still one of the most inspirational people in the city of New Orleans and it'll be scooped up in the endzone touchdown it was a big step in a long road to recovery and it was bigger than football for a man once known for flying all over the field flying these days takes on entirely new meaning for Steve Gleason but why would a man who can't walk eat or even breathe on his own fly across the country to Seattle just a few weeks ago to raise over three million dollars at a gala to fight the disease that has nearly killed him I'm not sure if Macklemore can hear us right now I got this sweet tuxedo shirt at the thrift shop I believe our responsibility as humans is when we give knock down we must not stay down we must help each other we must ask for help and stand back up regardless of how difficult that may be Steve and his wife Michelle welcomed their daughter gray a little over a month ago adding to a family that also includes seven year old son rivers how was having a baby possible are you asking me to explain to you about the birds and the bees Peter yes yes I am I wanted to have a baby four or five years ago but I think Michelle was right that we weren't in a good place at that point from the beginning of time Steve and I wanted to have a family we wanted to have kids he has a brother he's close with I have two big brothers who were my best friends you know I wanted to be able to look rivers in the eye when he got bigger and say I did everything I could to give you a sibling so here we are at the Saints facility Rivers is practicing flag football on drew breezes team what's it like for you to watch rivers play football yeah it's interesting because parents get to yell and provide encouragement to their kids but I don't get to do much of that which can be frustrating I talk with Drew and tell them things rivers is working on so that's awesome because he knows a thing or two about football I would think that you probably would have really loved to have been a coach of your son and maybe your daughter as well yeah I'm a coach in my own way not necessarily in the typical sense but I think that in many ways the things I'm coaching will be more valuable to rivers in gray so this Thanksgiving as usual Steve Gleason isn't focusing on what's been taken from him but rather everything and everyone he has to be thankful for it's a great time to have a child especially a daughter gray can be absolutely anything she wants to be some special people we visited with them at Saints practice yesterday Steve uses his eyes and that special keyboard to create the audio the sound you hear always remembered in this city Steve Gleason will be back but first Clara plays a game of tag and shows us just how fun it is to be it tonight's firsthalf highlights are brought to you by Chevrolet freeze Ryan what's the ball Saints think they have it they do shibby desert JD Power dependability awards for cars trucks and suv's and that sets the table for the third quarter Sunday night football on Thanksgiving night from NOLA New Orleans Louisiana sits on top 14 Falcons get the ball Mike Tirico Tony Dungy Rodney Harrison Happy Thanksgiving against Al Michaels Cris Collinsworth going with your great family with you here on Sunday night the guys will join you with the Vikings beat the Packers Michele Tafoya worked at both ends of this I was a little sour Kathryn return here for Marvin Hall first kickoff return opportunity of the night all get some blocking down the sideline will nuts and a foursome back inside we've been returned by Holl gives Atlanta good field position of the 40yard line if you were enjoying a little bit later dinner dinner on the west coast here's the buzzer get y'all caught up now the seats are up 14 in this third quarter Matt Ryan the passing numbers are good sat four times fumble laws also dropped one breeze continues the great completion percentage ten afford he did throw kick that Saints defense we're not talking much about the guys but again as they had the last two weeks making a difference in the Falcons in the red zone not good enough which has been their story on big stages over the last year plus the 40yard get returned his teman Coleman desperate to get a run game it is not fair AJ climbed the tackle and here is Michele Tafoya well yeah dan Quinn told me his his offense has to be more balanced meaning more Ron and obviously they have to protect the football but he said on third down we must get off the field on defense and we've got to make sure that harp defenders are in position to keep the running game in check Sean Payton said the first half third downs got more manageable which allowed them to stay on the field Mike did sustain a little bit to show and to that point you made at the beginning just nine runs for the Falcons compared to 20 now 21 passes is Calvin Ridley but only two yards it's a Jay Klein again before third down Tony Hall of Fame coach give your Super Bowl adjustments yeah Michelle for the Atlanta offense he talks about getting more runs I don't think that's the answers you can't handle that defensive line screens are the way to get the ball to Tevin Coleman screams just like we saw there and then in the red zone Mohamed Sanu that's that's the gotta go yeah if I'm the Saints defense I'm not changing anything continue to do what you can do a doubleteam Julio Jones keep the deep safeties back and the Falcons have shown they're incapable of making adjustments Knight third and tenth pressure on ryan gets rid of it Julio Jones the open field protocol but couldn't crawl in this field he's kept the yard knives past shy of the first down and they went for it on fourth down deep were in their own territory in the last Drive and I've seen no sign of Matt box of the punter we will go surprised to see him go for it again Dan Quinn knows he's got to put points on the board and Tony it's not even the desperation of the Saints and their offense you're four inches yes if you don't get it tonight it's probably ball game for the season exactly well you got a play to win the game that came out five wide receivers forth in to Earth's breeze gets the ball in great field position fires in the blinkin place and Salone was there they were trying to get it to counted Wrigley the Saints are going to start the half with the ball on their side of midfield we probably let drew cuz he's probably the patriarch of you know the families he's the oldest carve the turkey cam Jordan would be in charge of the music cams order to be in charge of the music I think music I'd get that cam Jordan so you know being a be a great team event so a Saints giving let be drew brees drew brees would sit at the head of that table know Westin about it no disrespect to Sean Payton though the players were sitting around for a party he's gonna line at the quarterback the breeze comes down here as a receiver I know what if I'm the free save him Mike about Demonte KZ I'm looked in the past because this guy can throw the ball down the field here is stepping up in the pocket now look at the takeoff and he loses the football was he down is the question and they say he was initially down Jack Crawford came in and wrapped him up so they try the run with the former college quarterback Hale who's lined up all over the place this year clearly the knees down and the elbows well good job by Crawford seventh year man had a Penn State create a package that Sean Payton has put together here with he'll seize a halfdozen positions when you start counting special teams it's even more no fool Mayer loss of three and Brees is back on his own side up infield your second and 13 and breeze off the spot so close and completes it to Ingram who took over the 45 yard line down at the 44 let's go back a couple of place ago Roger to that fourth down for Atlanta yeah Matt Ryan looks he's just making rookie mistakes here he is just staring at his receiver I talked about him earlier pre determining who he wants to go to and he really makes it easy Alexander Loney he's all he's doing is dropping back read the quarterback this is just an easy play for him Matt Ryan has to relax and not let the situation or the moment overwhelm the might a big placer angeloni forced the fumble on Julio Jones and fourth down stop reading the odds Ryan when a defense trying to hold up its third and five Michael Thomas he tried to bring it down his breeze tried to drop it over one level of the defense into his favorite target see if the seats will do here on fourth down this is the crossing route to Michael Thomas he got rubbed off and drew brees is just a little bit high you don't see this very often these guys are so exceptional in their timing drew can't believe that he missed his band keep the offense out there my friend Rick ties with the NFL Network says people hunters are people too hunters are lonely people on these teams everybody go for it on fourth down tonight this is right in New Orleans they get pretty going nothing it's fourth and five see Sean Payton here is gonna take a timeout fourth and five at the 43 if Tony it's been a balanced and effective effort over 100 rushing yards for the Saints yeah and I love what they've done running the ball inside Andrus peat is a big man but he's a good athlete here he's pulling didn't the block on those smaller linebackers here is the doubleteam coming off again on the linebacker trap block here athletic not just a big man you see the movement and again Albert tomorrow tamara has been the beneficiary a lot of these inside runs and the Falcons defense looks confused because the Saints are wearing them the Falcons out by bringing all these different formations all these personnel groups they just looked tired right now Mike this is new freeze now he's going to pick out the guy that he likes it again I'd look at Michael Thomas right here he's won he's 101 against the rookie Oliver tried to get him to jump I think that's this more bloody it is the smart play but I'm surprised it's Sean Payton didn't go for it his aggressive nature I thought they would go up up here and go for it they end up using the timeout for that don't drama off it's still fourth in fourth and 10 now it'll bring out Thomas Moore stead but that is the smart play you should pump this ball to way your defense playing more steady he tries very hard to keep his heart rate up because he's so inactive this is only his 22nd punt you see the punts per game so far first 10 they're on a pace for an NFL record more still have dropped in those down trying to pin the Falcons inside the 10 and they will fare cough like Justin Hardy rarely used but effective Thomas Marston makes the peers on this Thanksgiving night I wanted to create the most epic competition of pure athletic insanity get ready for blood sweat and respect you gravy and gravy well they made history on the cot talent stage this January 50 of the greatest return the ultimate competition America's Got Talent the champions first Monday of the new year premieres right here on NBC Brian and the Falcons take over from the knot and Julio Jones for 6 to the 15 with forward progress against Eli Apple who's been in the spotlight tonight he has and this is an adjustment Dennis Allen told us about yesterday he was going to put Eli Apple on Julio give him some help and he's been up to the challenge he has played physical onon he's used his help he's played smart and Atlanta has not adjusted Rodney yeah I'm looking at offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian this is when you make your adjustments you got Mohamed Sanu Austin Hooper your Titan he has 51 catches so obviously he's good enough to make plays Mike secondly for here Rodney Hicks to Ito Smith on the backfield for a couple hours down the road in Hattiesburg at Southern Miss yard shy of the first hand and zillow knee again on the time yeah and to me it's not about being Dallas anything like that you're not gonna run the football coach against his defense Matt Ryan has to take it in his hands he's got to drop back get the ball out of his hands quickly and make plays you're not gonna win the football game running the ball of mrs. down you get too many mismatches in their offense in front handle these guys consistently running the Rodney Tony they've run it nine times in the game the longest run seven by Matt Ryan on the fourth down scrambled late in the first half maybe you should give Porter back sleeping third one are you gonna run it in the middle Smith get there see the spot the initial sign from the st. Joe that is short needing to get to the 19 yard line and they're gonna come out and measure this you see AJ Klein here read this and they've got to get a cat to him no one can get to him he forces it back to the help and I think they're a little short here I just don't understand this you got a quarterback six for 220 pounds just to a quarterback sneak coach all you need is less than a yard started driving you should put the ball right on the yard marker you need to get right to the front end of the my team they don't it's for that HS and even in an ultra aggressive mode you gotta keep it away here back inside your own 20 fast defense fast linebackers when you hand it off to give them a chance to go up in there and blitz just to a quarterback sneak they're trying to get ito Smith in there to run it instead of Pullman places today Mr Bond say Freeman he's injured for the Falcons alvin kamara back deep to receive and that posture will kick it away for the Falcons three yards in pod 29 they want interference they don't get it Saints ball when we're back in 30 seconds after this message from AWS New Orleans milestone tonight for two of the city's favorite son Shump Payton and Drew Brees and playing this tune for a while but as long as Belichick and Brady but they pass Shula and Marino will start 185 same head coach and quarterback together little eNOS Belichick on the piano points per game twenty eight point three for those Patriot duo twenty eight points in for these guys a Herot of air Coryell Hall of Famer Dan Fouts on the trumpet Don Coryell and to watch them together and work together Tony is such a treat it was unbelievable watching yesterday just at the practice and then drew saying now we'll sit down tonight at the hotel and just go over everything that Shawn likes that I like putting it together in the package and come up with this game plan how we're gonna call the game tomorrow Peter King gave everyone a little bit of a look into that is football morning in America column one day NBC sports.com check that out from the 30 camara left a yard nothing else Alvin camara Robbie you said when he saw him it's like wow he's pretty big with him that's strong people don't realize how thick this guy is look how strong he is he's 218 pounds that's why you see so many guys missing tackles on that's incredible Mike don't ever try that either I'm good there I will not miss a football night show for an injury caused doing that he he did that at Tennessee part of that work to be did ruin to good back there he grew up just about 20 minutes step away from taking that a long way Sherrod leasman brings him down at the 41 for the first down for chimera Embassy and I really like this Mike the Saints they score so much there you could feel like Hayward we're struggling here but chimera out of the three wide set running inside they have an advantage to keep sounding this ball in there the coach look at the feet great block by Larry Wharf or pollute the feet look how quick just like a belly dance lady but 41 Brees at first look is covered they get into movie puts it walk Sidon Benjamin Watson brings it in at the 39yard line and Mike I tell you this I've had to cover that guy a lot of times in practice and I don't care how old he is when I met him he ran a four for this and even right now he runs a four or five but this is what you like about him veteran he sees his quarterback is in trouble and he just turns it up against Brooks Reed that's no contest right there again drew told us this key to his high completion percentage is knowing how to get those completions when everyone is covered he bought time moved his right found a guy who was tightly covered but put it right on the money 20 clock running down the Saints at the burn a timeout that's the second one they have used halfway through this third quarter we'll be back in the 32nd seats on top by 14 and driving big one Saturday on the side of the pond of the Premier League top for the table right now Chelsea and Tottenham you can see hairy feet in action at nez art as well be terrific game 12:30 Eastern here on NBC good one at Wembley Tottenham in Chelsea great taste Man City in the Premier League again that this year will let's pick down 21 Marvin Hall took the last pickoff back forty yards this one he brings out 26 will take over after Sunday night football on Thanksgiving that brought to you by Volkswagen don't just get an SUV at an SUV W by Samsung give the gift of galaxy and by American Express Small Business Saturday is November 24th of get up get out and shopping small that's Isles antiques in the heart of the French Quarter opened in 1899 fourthgeneration family ownership some shopping if you're in the quarter this weekend Falcon sneak points to Cooper the tight end game on first down I'm about seven yards against this New Orleans Saints defense ten and a half quarters now guys look at what they have done to the Bengals the Super Bowl champion Eagles in the Falcons that's a total of 24 points 11 sacks and seven turnovers in the last ten quarters when we talked to their coaches yesterday they said they are practicing better and that's what they attributed to this intensity pick up by those players and with a lead peacetime pulls it down throws to Julio Jones and grabs it at the 39 yard line in front of me line first down Atlanta just a little playaction pass you see Julio Jones right there tight split does a little push off and these are the type of plays you need Julio and Matt Ryan's and make that one earlier in the second quarter when they were driving down the field they had picked up the fourth down Julio took the shallow cross trying to fight for that extra yard airborne turnover every opportunity has not been able to gain momentum tefik Pullman runs in the edge look it to the 44yard line picked up a five here on first down with four and a half left in this third quarter and like I'm just really disappointed with the Falcons your season is on the line this is when you need your best players to come out and play well Julio had the big fumble Matt Ryan looks lost Calvin really only has two catches for 13 yards but you have to credit some of that to the Saints defense these guys have played well coach they scored 37 points in the first game against these same guys retreating and his ridley himself so space in a couple yard shorts Tony come back to that do you think this Saints defense has improved that significantly from week three I think they're playing better and this adjustment that they've made put an Eli Apple on Julio and given to him some help has really thrown the Falcons off yeah and I'm not taking anything away from the Saints defense and what they've done I think this defense is wrong but I'm looking at the Falcons and all these weapons and Julio talked about all the money that he wanted this is the time for you to step up and make plays third and two Ryan deep shock Lattimore blanketing Ridley fourthdown right around midfield we expected some of this mic to take some deep shots on third and short realizing you're gonna go for it on fourth down you talk about the guys not practicing I've got talked to Aaron Glen their defensive back coach and he said Marcia Lattimore started slowly at the beginning season because he wasn't putting for effort and practice picked up his practice habits now he's playing a lot better again I still think this is where you go to Mohamed Sanu Austin Hooper got it first down why it's this deafening roar for a moment in front of Vaughn bell it's like Seattle there were very few stadiums to get this loud these fans know their team has a lead they are bringing it with the noise they made know when to get loud yes the huddle they get louder and obviously when you get the line of scrimmage and I'd like to say the Falcons jump in to sum up tempo here you've got a score three times here so it's not too early to start thinking about that does bring whistles please any method Brian Hill has been in running back last couple of times with a good pressure the pass incomplete intended for Barbarin Hall yeah this is the mat tuck we were really hit instead of saying cam Jordan on Ryan Schrader he tries to jump in here probably holding penalty and really at this point Mike you come in with two running bags no one's fallen for the playaction pass because you're down just come out and your normal set three wide receivers you're tight in and throw the ball 42 plays for Atlanta 12 runs I can see many of the rest of the way with them try one here Toledo strip and Vaughn Beto was ready for it he and Sheldon Rincon's come up with a tackle for loss yeah this was actually a pass blitz and Vaughn Bell just runs through unblocked because the wide receiver can't get to him Mohammed sinuhe's got him but it's a blitz and he's not going to be able to find them wake up Ryan's got space to step up now throws on the reset breaking free is ridley kenny score Gavin rudely inside the five it'll be first and goal for Atlanta Brian created some time created some space and a big shot sir Ridley 450 here it is mantoman coverage and once the quarterback starts scrambling as a cornerback you have coverage you can't come out of your coverage and that's exactly what Marshawn Lattimore dead which Hampton credit Matt Ryan moving a little bit extending the play making a play out of the pocket longest play of the game for either team Falcons half to get it in in the red zone they'll get four cracks here from the two needles Smith is the batter Saints pressure up the middle Ryan back in the end zone incomplete try to get to Justin Hardy the 510 receiver so we asked Matt Ryan this week about the red zone and Julio Jones not being targeted much he said when you watch film and you see what other people do in the red zone two top receivers okay that's good we're doing our due diligence julio is gonna get treated different here's his red zone numbers only two games he's been targeted in the red zone six everybody else coming into this week 36 so does Antonio Brown and all of the Odell Beckham they get into double coverage it comes from the offensive coordinator you have to pass the ball to Julio Jones the man once again there's up top safety hope to the alley it looks that way wait Lattimore got twisted as he and Calvin Ridley collided along the goal line and will get third down here and one thing I noticed when I watched him practice the safety comes in from the right side so that gives a lot Apple a lot of confidence and I like what he's doing he's pushing these plant physicals playing with a lot of confidence that's a flag that stuck three paces off the edge of the green and that Ryan said I'm just going to jam it in there put it in there and get it and he could go you know Smith fourth down this is what you miss Devonta Freeman that tough inside running do you have Mohamed Sanu out there he's a six for wide receiver you got to give him at least one opportunity Alex Oak before the tackle you thought it was loud on this Drive before here they come a fourth down fourth Rodney Julio Jones put the ball up high form let him count jambalaya if I'm gonna go down I'm going down with my best player nasty Lil Jon maybe if the batter and it's definitely getting doubled here look at the other way he's model look at the other way telamon ridley spikes to the ball in traffic is the seats finally succumb in the red zone as ryan gets his first touchdown of the night Nick yeah Julio Jones out here on the right side and they're not going to let him beat them so this is double coverage he'll I can sit outside him Matt did a great job of just working adjusting finally finding the guy who was single quickly into all rookies in the NFL touchdown catches now on the season Matt Brian that's the extra point so he had the eat break out game in Game one against New Orleans seven catches and three touchdowns on this Drive Calvin Ridley 50 on that speak certain 13 play and then the one that mattered most in the red zone Falcons stay alive here late third down 14 from New Orleans tonight's aerial coverage proxy by Geico joys of this city great food great music wherever you go maybe a lot folks been coming down here for the NFC playoffs Saints have the heads head with the RAM so they went tonight they go to the one Rams go to the about the Bears at eight and three they won five in a row Cowboys now in first at six and five the wildcard team the others who are knocking on the door new game on Sunday night with Minnesota and Green Bay here on NBC fourth quarter begins with a breeze pass that is complete Dan Arnold who caught the touchdown a moment ago at the 44 yard line the other big game this week guys in the NFC Carolina Seattle so two games on Sunday significance that's impacting that wild card huh mmhmm again Mike this is where Drew Brees is so good rather than take an incompletion here just a fiveyard game but this makes it third and 2 instead of third and seven much much more readily attainable here 20 breeze on the night not prolific 14 of 19 but effective with three touchdowns he did throw his second interception on the season third and two incomplete he tried to get it to Keith Kirkwood temple play his third NFL game he couldn't so the Falcons defense does what they needed to do chance to get the ball back and make this a one score game this is one of those new receivers you rarely see Drew Brees missed the ball like this where he's got a guy open but just the chemistry is just a little bit off between he and Kirkwood here the rear seat punch came for Thomas foster kid a Falcons you definitely in his game the penalty marker down Morstan could not keep it inside the 10yard line there this flag comes back right after the kick as there was a backandforth with a couple of saints a couple of Falcons I should say and the Saints Chris banjo it was fourth and short often these times are after the kicked fouls so it doesn't affect who has the ball just affects where it is itself on the play both by the receiving team unnecessary roughness 15yard penalty keep the ball down so instead of the touchback and bringing it down they'll back them up around the 10yard line the explanation comes to dan Quint matt ryan a company had a long field to go here and that was Jack McKinley he got cut on the punt yeah that's banjo yeah he gets cut and then he gets frustrated guys don't like nobody going at their knees to tell you that but he's got to keep his composure teams still in the game dude she's got a to shows how frustrated they are there's a lot there may be more than Flags you get to next week in the league office looks at that the state's offense come back on the field they thought it was gonna be their fall but it was after the kick so the personal foul becomes a half the distance to the goal cuz the ball would have been at the 20th touch bags up Atlanta's got 90 to work here to get it down the field after been stripped of the night we faked to new one Ryan and and get close to the first down says he worked at the 19:1 chai that first out same play they ran earlier two tight ends trying to go playaction this was all set up trying to get Julio the ball the problem is you go play action you're pure tailback he goes the wrong way good job a man he can play alive gaining yards he's the Falcons leading rusher tonight Matt Ryan a one of seven and a run of nine he's got to 416 Dennis Allen told us yesterday that Frank's an annoying scrambling his scramble must but when he does just annoys you made a couple of plays with his feet here tonight try to get it to Calvin Ridley with Lattimore that matchup we've been watching from the jump tonight yeah and this is the matchup that I was expecting to see right here Marshawn Lattimore their best cornerback on Calvin Ridley and really just does an out route outstanding route but it hits him right in their hands he's got to be able to make that catch thought Matt Ryan delivered a perfect pass to the outside this is problematic here for the Falcons they had not been successful running the football and they go out with an homage to new helmets anew Muhammad Muhammad soon moon has thrown some touch down so alert for him in the passing game sinu got them to a certain plays asking for the snap here they get it off well wolf just in time sinuhe's gonna run for the first down this Owenton gets under the skin of folks and Terry I can bring you in Terry McCauley because the mechanics here have the official watching the play clock look at the clock and then look at the ball absolutely Mike there's always going to be a slight delay from the time the clock hits zero until he blows the whistle and throws the flag for delay if the ball moves by the time he gets back to this to the ball he's not gonna call it that's what happened here and he saw PJ Williams he was confused he went out and this is really where he would have been at the nickel bag Drive stays going and a half gone by in the fourth with the interception wide open inside but the ball got tip and every defender Sprint's down for the class picture tell you one thing they do Mike they worked extremely hard this is Tyler Davidson he gets his hands on it and what you guys say is defensive coordinators tips and overthrows votes yeah Julio Jones breaking up against that double coverage he is open tip ball creates the interception one of those nights from that Ryan first interception that he's thrown Davidson the deflection Klein gets the pick it's his second career interception his first one came with the Panthers it has been a night of frustration for this Atlanta team that had only turned it over eight times all year three tonight and you see Brees when he gets in the huddle there like that we're going right now if this is knockout punch time go on a big folks in like you the wide receiver now danger with the carrot inside take it to the 17yard line on first down a game of five and again most coaches would say hey I can run the ball here pound it in take time off the clock even if I kick a field goal that puts me back up three scores but that's not Sean Payton's mentality you're gonna see a shot play here very quickly to the ends especially with Taysom Hill in those laughs every time I see Sean play see it's just a mad scientist with the bigger menus you can find at a latenight diner in Jersey him he'll here to take the direct snap shoulder down first down Taysom Hill to the 8 we saw him yesterday at practice and he is a thick he he is a big kid and as the prominent the Falcons have had defensively is tackling this little fake handoff right here but this kid he runs with an attitude he's trying to punish you they actually had to play defendant well they just couldn't get him down his tackles once again it's been playing in Atlanta all year Phoebe 220 pounds quarterback at BYU areas ready to throw it's covered in scrambling he'll chase stays alive guys to deliver the blow he's taken down at the 4 yard line so mention the 4 4inch speed does this look like quarterbacks body to 21 it's just like Tom Brady vertical of 38 a half of BYU's pro day he took his latterday saint submission so two years before he got into college then was off injured to spent so much time rehabbing and working out got strong went to Green Bay the Packers waved him he wasn't playing until December of last year and then they put him on special teams and Sean Payton about all excited about this X quarterback I have here and all the stuff we could do with them they're doing it this year it's effective please just get inside in ten minutes here in the 4th and the Saints looking to go three scores up knocking Sean Payton a lot of credit I mean not trying to limit the kid allowing him to play you know he won't he's a football player he wants to play anywhere and get on the field and they plan on at the tight end position quarterback running back on a property Sean paid for on the slot personal protector on punt returns kicks he goes down on coverage great versatility on the roster third and goal in the lefty the backfield understand what davontea KZ is doing he's two yards in the endzone if you have mantoman coverage you got to come up here and challenge the guy this is too easy all you have to do is get in the end zone turn around and catch the ball that it has to be a lot more competitive than that go to do don't play man will let's bangs in that extra point where they say around here who that who they are is family Louis and Austin car and did Arnold and I'm Keith Kirkwood touchdown receptions from breeze tonight Sunday night football on this Thanksgiving Len is brought to you by Chevy Chevy Czar JD Power dependability award across cars trucks and SUVs by the new film portal engines in theaters and IMAX December 14th by cocacola enjoy an ice cold coke this holiday season and by untuk it jerks designed to be worn untucked untuck it table tip of the hat to the Falcons safe state to find to distribute nearly 2,000 Thanksgiving meals in the Atlanta and New Orleans area and that goes for every NFL team Margaret Hall on the return for the Falcons pass Taysom Hill in the other in coverage and will Lutz the kicker has to come out and get him around the 40yard line nice return so Ryan back Brees having quite a night four touchdown passes so four guys you probably don't know much about how much you're really following the Saints it's made it 13 different receivers with a touchdown catch it ties the record set by Matt Ryan in his MVP season of 2016 and he still got Brandon Marceau ready to he'll get one to him before the season's over Detroit only they cite Marshall a couple of weeks ago after Dez Bryant was signed and tore his Achilles in the second practice he had with the Saints fire nearby Ryan Julio Jones that's me Mike your seasons on the line you got to go no huddle here and you got to try to score three times to keep your season going and you got to go up tempo with urgent's absolutely if Lana got it four and four after the one in four start loss to the Browns going out of there by loss of the Cowboys said this little floater Ridley try to get it and Mario Davis was waiting under nine minutes left let's go Falcons you have to go here you got us for three times still your aim is to win the ballgame and the only way you can win it is to score quickly you down three touchdowns for the life of me that just taking their time like they're up three scores we're on seven on that last play Anke backfield get never on organized here on second and 17 where's mohammed sallu blitz coming after Ryan and the patch Ross at Hooper's old trough a flat the barrio Davis the linebacker we called for pass interference secondly 17 turns into first I'm just looking for Mohamed Sanu you have Ito Smith in a running back he's lined up as a wide receiver see mama Sydney weave back in the game Seville we've got going early Rodney and I know you pointed to it was being a key part of this offense three targets tonight three catches the last of those coming midway through the fourth quarter Lee ridiculous Mike I mean if you're going to double cover Julio Jones left Alvin Ridley's not coming up with big plays Mohamed Sanu was the most obvious choice from the inside here is you know Smith it's not down at the 46 yard line if you are wondering is he named after judge Lance Ito from distance truck yes during the trial they had a cousins that thought the baby who was born Ito Smith looked like Jody no and that's a horrid stop yes that's a true story second Cooper the barrio Davis catalyzed earlier it's the hint on the tightend data Stanford barely impressed with these linebackers might they play really really fast underrated guys they don't get they don't get a lot of pub ain't a financial only manti te'o has been inactive they say no when it's a two back team you'll see more manti te'o there aren't a lot of two back teams in the league and Angeloni stepped up his play in the middle of this growth has played very well third a halfdozen with five rushing sack number five for the seats in the dome tonight and you could almost you can almost see that one coming Ryan straighter not no help on this and this is a great counter move by cam Jordan the spin ice pick with the left elbow but if you were to run it back why are you chipping the other way you're going to Alex Okafor you need to stay with Cameron Jordan he's a Pro Bowler two for Cameron Jordan gonna get to the 39 to keep the ball and throws to Julio Jones they got 13 and 9 more and that time they Pape report they they take the tight and pump Logan Paulson and this is what you do to Cameron Jordan he's giving you a right tackle a lot of trouble just give him a little chip just to slow him down a little bit allows Matt Ryan to complete that pass and I still want to see the Falcons go quicker again you've got a sport three times it's not enough to score once with 30 pressure and it is recovered with a flag down late Ryan took a lick from DJ Williams we will deny the field with a fumble recovered by the often and add John Huss he'll sort the flag clip here giving Sean Payton his options and the referee communication system they can talk to each other and sod judge says push it back personal foul chop law offense under 25 it's on ito Smith the running back yeah Mike on this play Matt Ryan was staring at Julio Jones the linebacker comes out late and just gets in the way he thinks it's a double team and just forces him to hold the ball long enough for PJ Williams to come in there knock it out I tell you one of the things that they worked on in practice a lot of disguising he's seeing different guys move around the Dennis Allen defense coordinator he is a breslav minded defensive coordinator the Sean Payton initially accepted the penalty Josie's going over for a conversation here was then decided into the second down right it was first in ten see they got to be first at 25 with the penalty penalty it is second down anybody could find more time to deliberate if you wanted to take it or decline it that was those good lawyering 101 body what would you have done I would have turned it down yeah you want the second in 20 take the Santa on the sack fumble recovered by Falcons the 40 firing put two tested parties that's a blockage Cooper on the side speaks to the sidelines the game is six we're still on the other side of five minutes so the clock will get restarted once we dive under five getting out of bounds stops the clock until the next now which means you should be at the line move it don't understand that Mike I really don't miss Thanksgiving I was trying to say it nicely we did said it's space receivers you got experienced quarterback to play in the Super Bowl shouldn't be that hard third fourteen here comes that same pressure it's picked up as Ryan alive for Ridley maybe tackled with a 30yard line certainly a ghost spot here fourth and ten Portland see Thanksgiving night the great Sunday night crew finds a positive staff that's why these guys are the best for the business and Matt Ryan did frustrate he's trying to get his guys the right guys lined up and out there and it's a personnel exchange I love coming to games in the dome these fans don't quit on it we're going to hear brought down poor the pattern pressure coming right up quickly has made great efforts to get close and there's been a lid on that end zone tonight yet another mistake time to play nice tomorrow night on NFL Network we follow Chris Collinsworth journey star receiver the Bengals two Emmy Award winning broadcasters Willie the shot of his first broadcast right there a football life Cris Collinsworth it's a terrific series of shows done by our friends at the NFL Network and at 8 o'clock tomorrow night and we look forward to watching that from the 41 Matt Ryan down 21 Seiden picked up first down with seven pullman to the safe side to the 47 yard line rather he just said it in the break Falcons 3 he fumbles in the in this game a couple that they lost inside the red zone yeah just expected their all offense to come out and really lead this team I was just really surprised at Matt Ryan didn't play his best football your seasons on the line this is when you expect your best players to deliver here is sinew catching a pass for the first time since the first quarter he'll take it to the 41 yard line the story of the season for Atlanta has been finished their post can they finish and it was within each Drive tonight that they couldn't finish as opposed to the entirety night Dennis those red zone drives wit de Julio side with 30 yard line catch 10 for Jones over 120 yards again like a lot of the Julio Jones games 10 Texas gaudy yardage numbers but no touchdowns yeah and not the place when you needed them the best receivers in the league Ryan throws Austin who parade will hang on is antimony tackles it at the 19 yard line it's a good thing Matt Ryan is getting rid of this ball quick because there Sam Randy Jordan is beating Brian straighter every single play I don't like the fact that at the beginning of the game they gave the Saints the ball really just thought that really set the tone you don't give that one of the best offenses in the league especially drew Brees the ball first with a shot Jonesy 4 yard line so technically that'll be a red zone target for Julio a couple in this game and now 8 on the season and that takes us inside the twominute warning with a minute 57 to go well a very special edition of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon coming up after your local news here's a little sneak preview of what's ahead Jimmy what are you doing yeah I don't know me too much dude oh my gosh I can't do it I can't do the monologue there's no way you can't do the model I can't do the monologue I just ate too much I just ate all right I'll do the monologue that is worth staying up for Seinfeld doing the monologue I wish that was him y'all still haven't fit me inside two minutes years as incomplete intended for Marvin Hall it'll be second now we mention Bob Dylan also a rare TV appearance on Fallon tonight so a great Tonight Show ahead you can't sustain Oh buddy's got a good do anything to mark sip go shop right so it's speaking to the refrigerator find an extra piece of pie hanging around and watch great Tonight Show Fallon and Seinfeld and Bob Dylan among those speak to yourself my guy gotta catch the early flight good morning I gotta get some rest see you guys back to the studio on Sunday the football night in America before the Packers in the Vikings very important game trying to keep pace with the Bears right underneath then it's caught for the touchdown by seven Coleman touchdown reception number five on the season for the fourth year back out of Indiana and his seventh total touchdown of the year 3117 it is just a little option route by Tevin Coleman he goes out they think he's going out to the flat he comes back in and Matt just throws it right between two defenders second touchdown pass in the night for riding throws for 378 yards to this point Brian makes it a 14point game with 151 and likely an onside kick coming up so the Saints and the touchdowns we talked about having Michael Thomas an elite receiver undrafted Tommy Lee Lewis touchdown undrafted to the Patriots camp last year Austin Carr out of Northwestern touchdown Wisconsin first career touchdown rookie at a temple undrafted first career touchdown quite a night for these guys it's Thanksgiving night everybody's watching Drew Brees future Hall of Famer throws you a touchdown and you look at the career touchdown catches for these guys and when we talked to Drew you could see his eyes light up above these young guys he said he was having so much fun just kind of helping them along helping them grow and he said he'd trust these guys onside kick here it's been so difficult to recover onside kicks coming in just three of 34 recovered successfully just as the Falcons show their hand the timeout is taken by New Orleans Michele Tafoya Mike as in years past we're gonna award turkey legs to the players of the game these are good but our traditions gonna get a new twist this year the turkey will be prepared by Emeril Lagasse the renowned New Orleans chef I love that shot at Morgan Moses of a couple years ago washing digits ripping off that Lake we'll see we'll see who gets the turkey legs coming up here in a little bit where's that tradition started by the grape John Matt but it was the whole trick Duncan think it inside the duck inside the turkey and the first time somebody brought Madinah turducken was here and he was doing a game in New Orleans so the roots so that you're Duncan in the turn right here right here on the other side now with the recovery the minute 50 to go perhaps a candidate I think it's easy who gets the turkey leg I'm not gonna tell you who well let me just tell you that's all going to happen to the Volkswagen postgame report Michelle will dish out the turkey legs and the game balls for this Thanksgiving night and they'll look ahead to happy Thanksgiving to coach Madden is so much a part of watching this giving over the line I remember them I watched them all a tradition that it's a really elevated Thanksgiving guys give me the the state of the world here the Falcon to 4 &amp; 7 probably about it for their hopes I think they're done but I was really impressed with the Saints defense tonight if the Saints continue to play defense like this nobody's gonna beat them I'm gonna give a shoutout to the coach Dennis Allen a defensive coordinator as well as Aaron Glen their defensive backs coach I thought he did a terrific job at the secondary what game Thursday night Saints at Dallas the plate Pittsburgh down the stretch two against Carolina so it does not get easy for New Orleans we mentioned Atlanta at four and seven to be really hard road they'd have to win out to get tonight at seven they stuff to go to Green Bay they played Baltimore next week up in Atlanta and they had hopes of hosting the Super Bowl and mercedesbenz stadium in Atlanta but it's going to be a tough road they have to win out and get some help to just make it to the tournament just too many injuries offensively with the guards defensively he moves Deon Jones and two safeties guys New Orleans has the offense thing will be interesting to watch here their defense played well again do they have the best defense of these three and lead offenses with Kansas City the Rams and the sinks it look like it tonight it plays with a lot of effort and energy and turning the ball over and getting it back for Drew Brees they continue to play this hard a bit tough to be don't sleep on those Cowboys that defense is a real deer right there no quarterback meeting more often Drew Brees and Matt Ryan for the 21st time and Drew Brees wins it for the 13th time and gets the sweep this year with Matt ride 31:17 in the dome the New Orleans Saints stayed tied for the best record in the league and they have that head to head over the RAM so top of the mountain team down here in knowledge 31:17 Saints at the Volkswagen postgame report and the turkey legs handed up by Michelle all coming up after these messages from your local NBC station who's going to get the leg come back welcome to the Volkswagen SUV W postgame report here now Mike Tirico they opened up oh and one they've won 10 straight hottest team in the league with the Orleans Saints host Thanksgiving and do it with style 31:17 they beat their southern rival bailout of alkanes and our players of the game Drew Brees the four touchdown passes to four different receivers to whom it never caught an ethical touchdown alvin kamara another solid beam 98 total yards and 15 touches and Cameron Jordan had two sacked if you want to throw in shell the rankings in there Mark Ingram was a factor big game and they're all around Michele Tafoya who's got a table at midfield in the Superdome okay selfie with the turkey it's a good thing all this extra Turkey because everyone decided to show up guys grab a turkey leg and roll Agassi maybe you got a go ahead I want to hear who they are scrumptious well we don't have any beverages at the moment but I was just gonna ask drew something but he has a mouth full of Turkey so Alvin I'll start with you how thankful are you for the offensive line and what they did for you guys tonight so thankful you know we talk about it every week man they start they set the tempo for our offense in you know without them you know who want to be where we are so thankful for them and you know they bring it every week they don't get they don't get the credit but that deserve it well yeah if we had more Turkey they probably here too they drew four touchdown passes each one to went undrafted guy I mean it was really remarkable what made it work well first of all those guys those guys really stepped up we were down some receivers today but those guys stepped up and took advantage of their opportunities and we knew they were going to need to obviously there's a lot of attention on these two and on Mike so those guys really stepped up to the challenge and it was really excited for him obviously it was an exciting day for them and great way to bring in the Thanksgiving holiday sliding day for the defense as well guys six sacks you forced four turnovers you and two of the sacks had to disrupt your eating here but you don't even eat no nice are we good about to begin you know what people think of the Saints as an offensive juggernaut what do you think this defense showed tonight office is a juggernaut but that being said we have to match that intensity and I think tonight we came out with that right mentality the right game plan the ability to execute that game plan and get out to the quarterback and I mean honestly I love this win like I love this turkey here's like in the turkey emerald drew what do you like most about this football team we we care about one another we love coming to work every day we know how to have a good time we also know when it's time to work and get down to business so I think having that healthy balance of both but bottom line is we love being around each other can't wait to get back in this locker room and celebrated with our teammates and just keep stacking up game balls to Drew Alvin and Cameron go ahead take your game balls guys go with you Mike to repo the turkeys gone back to you thanks no leftovers run through them but still great job in the last five days they've beaten the last two teams to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl by combined total of 79 to 24 be right back in New Orleans
