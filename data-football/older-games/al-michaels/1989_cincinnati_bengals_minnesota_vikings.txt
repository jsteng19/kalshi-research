============================================================

Vikings win they're in the playoffs and Green Bay is out tonight the Bengals must win to make the playoffs and the Vikings must win to make the playoffs two teams their playoff lives on the line tonight Cincinnati bingo feed the Minnesota Vikings on ABC's Andy the big games all the trick play this room here for 20 years and here is no mistake make everything night football's come in on tonight are you ready my rowdy friends are hell for Monday night ABC's Monday Night Football brought to you by Budweiser beechwood aged that clean crisp taste this Bud's for you by Ford in your Ford dealer have you driven a Ford lately by IBM whatever your size whatever you need iBM is working to bring you the best solution and by ITT building businesses into leaders from the Metrodome in Minneapolis on Christmas night the final game of the 1989 regular season the Cincinnati Bengals and the Minnesota Vikings and tonight for both teams just suddendeath a win tonight and it's on to the playoffs a loss Andy it is all over and let's take a look at the two scenarios that could take place tonight if Cincinnati wins Houston will be at Cincinnati at an AFC wild wild card game Green Bay clinches the NFC Central championship Pittsburgh is out of the playoffs Minnesota out of the playoffs now if Minnesota should win tonight Pittsburgh will be at Houston in the AFC wild card game that game next Sunday Minnesota clinches the NFC central championship Cincinnati out of the playoffs Green Bay out of the playoffs and there it is hello again everyone I'm Frank Gifford we're delighted you're with us merry christmas happy holiday and again what a pleasure to bring you this final game of the 1989 regular season Cincinnati coming into tonight with an 8 and 7 record they came within inches of course of winning at all and a Joe Montana miracle took it away from in the final seconds in Super Bowl 23 but they come in a very confident football team off a 61 to 7 victory over Houston and a team you get the sense that they plan on other games for this season meanwhile the Minnesota Vikings a trouble team there are 9 and 6 on the year and they have the number one defense in the entire National Football League but when they get that points they give up those points at the wrong time they have an offense that when they acquired Herschel Walker was said to be the final spoke in the wheel of it take them to the Super Bowl and now Michaels if I could die could quote a former colleague of mine that has not eventuated I think I remember that colleague it hasn't eventuated and and one reason the Vikings have had problems offensively this year is that Walker has not become the dominant force they had hoped that he would Anthony Carter has been bothered by injuries but most importantly they have gotten very very inconsistent play from their Florida backs in particular Wade Wilson who left last week's game against Cleveland with a knee injury in the fourth quarter Tommy Cramer finished up they lost in overtime Wilson though is fine tonight and will start tonight's game the most important of his career as Minnesota tries to extend his season but they do have two things going do the Vikings as Frank mentioned the number one defense in the league and this team has not lost the game at home this year they are seven and O in the dome in 1989 and going back to last season counting their playoff victory against the Rams the Vikings have won their last 12 home games tonight then they face the Bengals and there's no question if the Bengals play the way they did against Houston last week they will be playing at riverfront on Sunday and nice tie Santa I like you very much the kids struck again at Pizza also have Santa Claus on my socks you know there's the rub al and use the word inconsistent when you talked about the Viking quarterback situation inconsistent has to describe this entire Bengal ballclub twice this year they've had games where they've scored in the 50s and in the 40s followed it up the next week with games where they only scored seven points Sam Weiss has implored his ballclub guys we can't have another offensive lapse we've reached the playoffs now that's what tonight's ballgame is a playoff game one offensive lapse we're out of it if you like life in the pits folks it doesn't get any better than what you're going to see tonight the Bengal offensive line against the Viking defensive line in particular rhymers and Munoz on the left side of the Bengal line against Maillard and dolmen gradea stuff and here we go as the 1989 regular season comes to an end to wildfire games to be played Sunday for certain one of them at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia the Rams against the Eagles the other either at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati if the Bengals win tonight or at the Astrodome in Houston where the Oilers would host Pittsburgh if Minnesota wins tonight Lee Johnson to kickoff for Cincinnati and Anthony Carter goes back to return kickoffs tonight a walnut versus Walker and alfred anderson and that's a different question jerry burns harder in past years has returned punts but here he is on the kickoff team and Johnson's line drive is dropped by Anderson picked up by Carter at the 4 and Anthony Carter gets thrown out of bounds up at about the 23 yard line by Ricky Dixon so the Vikings will take over at that point Wade Wilson and his numbers not good at all 7 touchdowns and 12 interceptions and he's well down the list averaging under 7 yards per pass attempt offensively Herschel Walker and Rick penny are the running backs Carter and Hassan Jones the wide outs Steve Jordan along with Keith Jackson a Philly going to the Pro Bowl Zimmerman named McDaniel are both going to the Pro Bowl allowed him up the center with keyless and Tim Allen from the 23 Wilson to throw to set up the screen hits penny has unless beginning for Minnesota so a little scream perfectly executed to Ric Finney and a 28yard picked up for the Vikings on their first play great call team is fired up they are smoking down there tonight you get the big pass watch the screen passes designed to let them come in let them take advantage of the rush and a good move by finding good blocks out in front Loudermilk with Zaire McDaniel the troll bowler thinnies longest play of the year and what a time to get it first and 10 Minnesota from the 48 yard line it is Walker and Walker starting right going left and that didn't fool anybody loss of two McClendon Crum rye and Buck who made the last tackle the three up front white Zander Kelly and Willis be Reggie Williams last game ever number 57 Phillips and Thomas of the corners Fulcher and Dixon of the safeties Reggie Williams has already announced his retirement number 57 elected recently to the Cincinnati City Council will his season be extended at least one more week that depends on the outcome tonight second and 12 bangles showing corner blitz and here they come they love to do that they pick up the corner and Wilson his partner for a first down at the 37 yard line the back first down smoking crazy and Dixon in on the tackle 17 yard game there is AC Anthony Carter his 59th catch of the season a simple turn in the ball is a little bit high from Wilson but look at the good hands Carter protecting the ball with his body goes up and make no doubt about it if the Vikings are going to make any noise offensively tonight the big guy probably won't be Herschel Walker it'll be Anthony Carter they need one or the other to have a big night and as motion Gary Zimmerman number 65 was moving and our first flag of the night Pat Haggerty is the referee Paul start 65 is against the man he'll be going to the professed Aries immerman out of Oregon in his fourth year he and McDaniel who lineup side by side we'll both be playing in Hawaii in February quite a feat al for Randall McDaniel who plays next to Gary Zimmerman I mean only a second year in the league and to achieve that kind of notoriety number 64 right there from his peers and coaches around the NFC that's that's tough to do in a shorter period of time as Randall McDaniel has done and they are 2 of 7 Vikings who go to the Pro Bowl first and 15 the middle Herschel Walker taken down at the 38 yard line by skip McClendon number 72 McClendon third year out of Arizona State Jerri burns then a tough year Forum all things considered for a team that is nine and six so much was expected of this team I think more magazines more supposed experts pick the Vikings to win it all than any other team in preseason can only assume by saying supposed experts oh you weren't one of them no definitely not way to bail out on that way none of the three of us second and tan as Rick penny takes it across the 35 to the 33yard line everybody's a supposed to expert at this time of year Boomer Esiason keeping that valuable right arm I want to hear you get out of this oh yeah you're right look this I was gonna say it's sort of strange to see boomer trying to keep the right elbow wolf keeping it up let's put it this way under wraps big boomers left handed third down and six well that's what I mean by suppose an expert from the 33 out of the shotgun Wilson so the Vikings who are soaking it offensively last week for the most part against Cleveland come out shredding the Cincinnati defense initially tonight let's take a look at it's not a pick exactly but it's a little cross and then Anthony Carter breaks it back out going against Eric Thomas and the key thing Wade Wilson right on target Wade Wilson went out of last week's game against Cleveland bruised knee it's been puffy all week but he has now picked up two receivers are connected on two key plays and gets the first down again the Anthony Carter this is what they need a big night from Carta to give them the explosive offense they know they've got they just haven't been getting it from the 19 off the fake to Walker going back the other way for the open Steve Jordan he'd gotten free and that's the first time that Wilson has misfired the 90 is 3/4 for the beat and Reggie Williams had Jordan when you talk to a lot of coaches around the league in a game of this magnitude I think they'll tell you that they don't mind at all starting the game defensively they don't mind throwing their defensive team out there because a lot of times you're a little tight offensively and it's tough to make things happen but to watch Minnesota in the way that they're operating here on their initial offensive possession of the ball game why that's certainly that's a scenario tonight they've opened this series like they've been playing like this is the middle of the third quarter second and 10 from the 19 yard line Wilson throws it's deflected out of the hands of Rickey Dixon who can't believe it it was almost too easy for the crowds booing they want a penalty I think the crowd would like an interference penalty but Ricky Dixon and Al he's gone to the end zone he is gone if Dixon holds on to it but again you hear the reaction of the crowd they're reacting to the scoreboard replay waiting for interference you be the judge here's Anthony Carter working against Louisville ups that's a good defensive play by Billups from that angle looks like there was some contact before the ball got there but he timed it pretty well third and 10 this is the ninth play of the opening drive crusher Finney vulture is able to drag him down by his ankles at the 14 and the Minnesota field goal unit with rich scarless will come in so the Bengals stiffened after Minnesota had picked up three successive first downs the ball is at the 13 yard line so upcoming will be about a 31 yard attempt for Carles the longtime Bronco couldn't come to terms with Denver what a year he's having he was at home for a couple of weeks at the outset of the season signed with Minnesota nice to leave Denver and kick indoors for a while isn't he's made the most of it Scribner holding from 31 so on the opening drive the Vikings control the ball for the first 5:30 of the opening period 3nothing Minnesota holiday greetings from Budweiser the

down into the I think five to seven range they said contest here tonight for the best Santa Claus or the best Christmas wardrobe their Vikings lead three nothing again the winners to the playoffs the losers home Karlis to kick off its on Hollifield and Richard Carey deep for the Bengals carry from the egg we'll set the Cincinnati offense the offense that erupted exploded 461 last week against the Oilers led by Boomer Esiason this year again averaging close to 8 yards per pass attempt and as you can see better than a 3 to 1 touchdown to interception ratio Brooks and Eric ball a UCLA rookie in the running backs McGee having a terrific season in ground holman goes to the Provo moon Slimers kazursky Montoya and Walter upfront new Leo's of course as always Montoya as an alternate from the 20 Esiason throws and the catch is made by Eddie Brown now that about the 28 yard line a couple of yards short of the first down Minnesota tops in the league in defense that means they've allowed the fewest yards in the league and it's Noga Thomas Maillard and Dolman that fearsome foursome up front deuce pabich spells Mike Merriweather who's inactive tonight he's hurt stud well and berry are the other backers of those for Lee and go to the probowl second down in the 28 massive audibly changing everything on second and the fake ball and Esiason lost it to Brooks and Brooks is out of bounds after picking up a first down to the 40yard line run out of bounds there by Reggie Rutland number 48 and here you hear the expression all the time frank about it this guy plays big I don't know of a player in the league that that applies to more than James Brooks here's a guy that even on that last play when he's by the sideline rather than just dance out of bounds lowers the shoulder and takes on Reggie Rutland this is a guy that plays 20 pounds heavier than he really is JB James Brooks see the Bengals change he once again that take a lot of for Boomer Esiason is a short huddle you Minnesota tries to change personnel though snap the ball first and ten from the forty Esiason with time and throws incomplete intended for Rodney holding over the middle and Henry Thomas put the pressure on number 97 little Christmas greeting for a sizeable and Joey browner was right there covering Rodney Holmen decison had to get rid of it under pressure and there's that little huddle as we look at the replay once again now Esiason with Holmen covered at this point by browner just has to fire it incomplete second and ten from the 40 here's Brooks flip moves to the outside breaks attacks on the picks up five well and Bullington in on the play it'll be third in about five one of the best matchups tonight might not be actually by the guys with ailments on I think a lot of people at acknowledge its Sam Weiss is one of the great offensive lines in the game but tonight he's matching wits with Floyd Peters the defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings so might be the best defensive coordinator in the game of football is white goose are ranked number one and it's a little chess game going on right now between those two third and a short five from the 45 three nothing Minnesota each 25 to go on the opening quarter they send Brooks and motion Esiason looks the other way and fell short crowd responds to the Minnesota team now the D can take the credit but that was just under thrown by a science and McGee at the defender beat me at the first down yardage and Esiason just under through Leo Lewis back to receive Lee Johnson's kick Lewis standing at his own 12 yard line Louis at the 12 and runs it back to the 20 that's an 8 yard return and braiding makes the tackle and with 806 to play in the first quarter at the Metrodome its Minnesota 3 Cincinnati they say that by a certain age you fall into a predictable pattern of statistics one spouse 2.5 children one threebedroom home and a typical fourdoor sedan but what do they know the 220 horsepower 24valve Ford

the proving grounds the results stp gas treatment is the age it was like cooperation and then I called my sister it's wonderful harvest time especially a yearend salute to dance champions of 89 John Jack Whittaker for a look back up a championships of the USGA Saturday on ABC Sports some of you may know this by now but we are terribly saddened to report the death of Billy Martin in a onecar accident in upstate New York the town of Fenton New York Martin living there a one car accident in his pickup truck skidding down an icy road about four hours ago the former manager of the New York Yankees dead on Christmas night in a onecar accident his personal Walker picks up five on first on Sam Martin a long time and several time Yankee manager also managed that Tigers and the A's and the Rangers and for a while right here with the Minnesota Twins dead at the age of 61 and out on mad at the problems he had over the years want to think clearly truly great people a fiery competitor we shared Yankee Stadium during my playing days I saw him about four weeks ago we were cooked March of Dimes he was happy love the circumstances up there and a truly sad situation second down and five for Minnesota from the 25yard line as Rick petty fights his lay for what might be a first down and to get to the 30yard line and that is where he is and take a look e perhaps bring in the sticks is panting dirty checks and tells us first down at the 30 yard line Jerry Burns one time the head coach at the University of Iowa longtime NFL assistant from the 30yard line Finney picks up about sex as he takes it out to the 36 yard line that it's funny no pun intended Finney is the guy who even after Walker came over in the trade from Dallas has seen more and more action and is playing more and more a part of this Minnesota offensive scheme and a guy who really just cracks the line up here in Minnesota as a short yardage back you see is over 230 pounds and really just broke in carrying the ball down near the goal line or whenever they needed a tough yard but 25 receptions on the year over 500 yards rushing a good allaround back second and four here's Walker Afeni and walker so on this drive the Vikings by the way are one running back PJ Dozier is hurt and he is on the inactive list tonight along with the linebacker Mike Merriweather difference between offending in a walker if they ever popped through their Walker you know is gone Finney is turning to possibly turn it into a 10 12 15 yard game but Walker can break it all the way Stefani his office he wasn't here in training camp is not the type of offense that you would design for Herschel Walker if you had him right through ten from the 41 often play fake that buys Wilson a lot of time first day at the quarry well you touched on it about buying a lot of time when you can take it side end and running towards the sidelines and then take him all the way around the corner Leon White a linebacker is not going to be able to stay with a tight end who's got the swiftness of Steve Jordan you cannot give him that much time good work by Wade Wilson to Danny looked off to receivers before he found Jordan 32 yard pickup and here's Finney taking it to the 25 yard line a minimal gain well in Pittsburgh tonight at the home of Dwayne Woodruff is mr. Woodroof himself along with Keith Willis I'm surprised you guys aren't dressed in full Viking regalia at this point well I know you got to be happy about the way things are going to this moment definitely this is the closest we could get to a Viking purple but it looks like the guns are what's up for us to read less I don't know if you heard that either but I know the LIA Steelers to a man in Pittsburgh obviously rooting on the Vikings so they can keep their season alive and about three yards short of the first down where Tim from Roy number 69 makes the tackle it Brady put the pressure that time on and what a story Crum Ryan has become you'll all recall the severely fractured leg in the Super Bowl and he vowed to be back on opening day back he was and he's still not back to you know the type of player that he was before but the key thing for Tim crumb rye is he's better every week than he was the week before I see no reason and coaches that next year by the beginning of the season it shouldn't be the old Tim from Ron the undisputed leader that defensive team third and along to and David Fulcher has limped off the field and it's Anthony Carter who has it busted up by Eric Thomas with perfect timing crowd launched a penalty but there's no laundry on the field fourth down when you get down there close this is the kind of coverage you have to put on Anthony Carter it's dangerous because of Carter speed but look at Thomas he's played well for Cincinnati this year doesn't have the big numbers doesn't have the interceptions but he has given Sam White's that kind of play and that was superb defensive play on a tough wide receiver Anthony Carter I'd assume the flag looked like he had his left hand up on his neck before the ball was there very very close close call 37 yard attempt by Carlos and this one is good good by flooding no laundry it's a beauty two field goals by Carles 347 to go in the first quarter section of Ikes it began as a game turned into a battle now it's out of control but bold tune coming January 28th the facts speak for themselves from personal to advanced fullcolor America's most popular copier is Canon call tollfree 18007897895 and America our warmest wishes during the holiday season have a happy and healthy New Year back in the Metrodome on Christmas night hope it's been a great holiday for you maybe you're kicking back right now and taken in the final game of the 1989 season a beauty when you're in lose your home simple as that the playoffs have begun a week early for both of these clubs now would you like to be a Steeler or a Green Bay Packer at this moment Minnesota leading six to nothing crimeless is kick coming down covered up by Richard Carey as well Perry and Hollifield were back there and looking at each other and saying I thought you were gonna take it no I thought you were gonna take it somebody back there is supposed to be the holler man obviously nobody was or somebody didn't hear it and it just about bingos the turnover because it is deep and own territory I think Kerry got down there on it you've got a rookie fairy in the first year man Hollifield and now we've got major crowd noise Cincinnati from the 14 yard line here's Brooks behind ball touching off a ball block picks up the first down and James Brooks having another sensational year is out of bounds at the 31 and a flag down on joey browner well after the whistle and outofbounds 17yard game and even more to be tacked on now well that's one way to get the crowd to sit back in their seats of 47 so here you have Cincinnati making what could have been a catastrophic mistake on the kickoff return and how quickly it turns around look at the blocks to open it up all with the beauty James Brooks Ihnen way out of bounds Joey browner unnecessarily throwing James Brooks to the ground it doesn't look like a whole lot but browner knew where he was watch how far out of bounds he is and he finishes it off there's one thing they've enforced this year is that we've seen it almost every game they are really watching that sideline and look what happens you don't want to take that chance this kind of game that really hurts a ballclub now they split Brooks to the right on first down from the 46 yard line the play clock is down to five seconds two three seconds and they just do get it off and they give it to Eric ball and he has stopped after a minimal the tackle is made by Marcy's Babak after a yoga made the initial contact news pabich is the man at a Minnesota the University of Minnesota spelling the injured Mike Merriweather and I think how we probably would be seeing Stanford Jennings in there if he were able to go tonight bruised back he is on the field and in uniform but Gary ball the rookie to UCLA open tonight Jennings ordinarily would line up from the two backs ever James Brooks second and eight pressure is on from Goldman but he gets the pants Elena Brooks another first down there's a flag down he takes it to the 35 yard line of Minnesota there's a flag down back at the Cincinnati 42 thrown by the line judge coming back so negate the game by Brooks what would have been an 18yard pickup the original line of scrimmage was the 47 Trippi 75 that's a Bruce rhymers who is among the Bengals who is fighting the flu tonight Sam White's telling us before the game he'd keep a close eye on rhymers well he's not only fighting the flu but he's fighting teeth Maillard as well he'll give you the flu yeah if you weren't sick before the game started he'll make heal in a hurry puts it back to the 37 yard line makes his second down and 19 is a science and a life feels one of us busted off and painted format regi Rutland again and there's a flag down in the back field McGee protesting because rutland reached around but he also had his other arm on the back of McGee he really upset another penalty coming up against Cincinnati driffold another tripping to 74 first let's take a look what's the right arm as he reaches around and uses the momentum of Magee to knock the ball away it would appear that the officials as far as the secondary is concerned are going to let them play but nothing is going to go on an unannounced or undetected on the offensive line that time was Brian Plato's getting called for the trip back to back tripping call the only time I've seen that is in the National Hockey League third down and 19 from the 37 yard line no two minutes in the box here no and a Vikings in here they found were they drawn what happened is the large flinched and I think he got rhymers to come out of his stance well start and Sam Weiss told us down on the field that he got hit with the flu bug last night and Bruce rhymers was one of Werth C maillard goes first but he causes the rocking forward in the flinching by rhymers and where it's terribly unfair for an offensive lineman that guy across from you can jump Frank but you've got to stay still yeah and then you know to Millar he is so quick off the ball primers has been watching films of maillard who just absolutely times it up beautifully with that a large so here's the Lord all the way outside on moon third and 24 they have to get to the Minnesota 44 for a first down Brooks escapes it's at pants 2:30 and Brooks to the 39 yard line James Brooks turns absolutely nothing into a minimal gain anyway as he escaped Graham at first Noga almost had him in the backfield and then James Brooks is able to finally get him back to the 39 yard line boy what a job Brooks has done this year they lost Hickey woods the thousand yard rusher from a year ago they're leading right there and Brooks has taken up the slack and that that's just a great athlete performing for you turns a loss of six or seven yards into a big pickup a Cincinnati will at least be able to putt from better field position Lee Johnson to buddhic Leo Lewis back to accepted it's a low line drive could be a decent run back as Lewis at the 22 exploited by bringing it out to the 39 pick results in a 17yard return that's a great play by Lewis even if he doesn't return it anywhere just handle the ball don't let it go towards your own goal line 140 to play first quarter grab a bucket and mop scrub the bottom and top there is nothing so clean that's my burger machine whip up romantic right brother rush what a shine on the floor we made it one dad and McDonald Soldier Field Chicago over 300 dead batteries and one diehard battery our most powerful ever jump starts everyone diehard more power when you need it most have you ever wondered what a baggage handler might take on vacation what everyone should take Samsonite's glutton for punishment the Syracuse Orangemen have Georgia on their minds they head down the width later to tangle with a ferocious Bulldog defense in the Peach Bowl Saturday on ABC issues down left to right in Green Bay a live picture Don Makowski the great quarterback John Spagnola Chuck Cecil and Brian Noble they've congregated at Brian nobles house Brian do you have any message for Boomer Esiason yeah you guys you guys got to beat the Minnesota Vikings don't beat yourself just keep on plugging away and things will turn out all right we got talking to you guys Brian whichever way it goes congratulations on a great year the pack is definitely back thank you very much you're appreciated all right we'll be back in contact with the guys in Green Bay and the Steelers as well in Pittsburgh from the 39 yard line listen pitch tiger a first down at the 50 yard line pick up Eric Thomas with the coverage and the Vikings were at midfield in the waning moments of the first quarter talk about a burglar making the catch and getting out of the way as quickly as you can Anthony Carter knows there's nothing but bad news at the end of this catch it get down disappear that's that's like a guy who has his hand into the jewelcase and grabs a necklace and is gone in about an eighth of a second count it and get out somewhere hovering back there is a guy named David poacher all 237 pounds of him and it doesn't look as though Anthony Carter comes off limping and he has had a lot of hamstring problems this season from the 49 yard line here is Finney and he can't turn inside of Herschel Walker block and his stop after a short pickup at roughly the 48 yard line there is car to me while Fulcher is also shaken up and he is on the cincinnati sideline at the moment in barney bus he is in spelling him at strong safety hard to have a better year the david Folgers having for the bengals eight interceptions for fumble recoveries leads the league with 12 takeaways and deservedly going to Hawaii to the Pro Bowl a big man in the secondary nip three voff Houston last week second and nine Wilson offer roll throws in the key why my son Joel a first out he's earned outside Luis Billups and brought it in with 14 ticks remaining on a clock in the first quarter this offensive team from Minnesota starting with their coordinator Bob Snell Curran through their quarterback Wade Wilson spilling over to Herschel Walker and everyone involved it's taken a lot of criticism this year part of it comes from the fact that their defensive team has been so dominating but if anything has been the blame here in Minnesota it has been their lack of offensive production but you would never guess that the way they've played so far in the first quarter first and ten from the 35 yard line and here's Walker piling forward for four on what will be the final play of the opening quarter Crum rye and McClendon converge on the tackle so Wilson goes over to talk it over with burns and snooker and the first quarter is gone Christmas night in Minneapolis with a score Minnesota six Cincinnati nothing

Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf on Christmas night we start the second quarter and on second and seven for Minnesota its Rick penny fighting his way forward for a first down under the 21 Kurt Loudermilk Minnesota dominating and dominating time of possession and validating numbers in the first quarter as you take a look at them well you know a lot of times the numbers like this don't really tell the story you look at the difference there in time of possession an eight minute difference but they are telling us one thing right now and that is right now the Vikings are controlling the line of scrimmage and Cincinnati is going to have to compensate somehow somehow there's going to have to be more run support more pressure on the quarterback if that involves bringing up an eight man they're going to have to do it and look right there a lot of people close to the line first and ten from the 21 yard line feni makes the catch and gets spun down by Zander after a pickup of 1 to the 20 but it's a blitz by Reggie Williams they're in Cincinnati making an adjustment they're going to have to flood the line of scrimmage Reggie came on the Blitz forces Wilson to maybe get it out there a half second before he wants to and disrupt the timing of the play the Bengals are in a position on the field now where they're going to have to take some chances another great performer over the years now in his 14th season this could be his final game is 206 regular season game get off 2nd and 8th from the 19 yard line bikes on top six to nothing Wilson fires into the end zone Hasaan Jones and Lewis Billups with a little salute after breaking the playoff I don't know who he thinks he's saluting his line is right in his throat for the moment I mean that was just just barely getting there take a look once again Hassan Jones who is the good move man doesn't have the speed of Anthony Carter now watch Phillips he has to get back into this play just does get there in the crowd watching the replay thought that he got there a little early but he did save it well they've been the crowd has had a little justification but that's that's just a great play by Phillips that's not even close to interference third down and eight from the 19 yard line that's Leo Lewis in motion stays in the block and they get to walk that's very close to a first down cut off a flock by rain and very close to a first we're just talking about huge holes up front Oh I mean this is a situation where the guys in the purple jerseys are just eradicating the bangl defensive line in line Kahless the right guard makes a fine block see Kayla's number 69 as he blocks down on David Grant pins him to the inside Zimmerman comes around makes a block on scowling while what a nicelooking hole up the middle in the lead block for Jesse klaris is just a dominating effort by the Vikings up front they appear to be short of the first down they've already sent in three tight ends they are that much shy of the first almost a full yard at the 11 yard line you lead six to nothing they're gonna go for it Cincinnati came in dude 27th in the league against the rest the numbers of yards that they have given up this is not lost on the offensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings Bob snuffer so up they come in the eye not been good at stopping teams when they get down close either and they give it to the upside lots of stairs taking it to the aid and setting up the first and goal but if you're going to go on fourth and short and you've got a couple of Pro Bowlers to the left side and Randall McDaniel and Gary Zimmerman why not follow them and this is again it's you love to give credit to the backs but look what happens up front look how they are blown out Zimmerman 65 McDaniel 64 Novosel speak coming in motion I mean this is just a case where Cincinnati is getting run out of the ballpark on their defensive line what did you love to give credit to the backside let's go back over there why not when you don't get hit until you've gotten where you're supposed to be first and goal and Wilson lines up on his back under severe pressure led by Carl Zander and dumps it off incomplete I mean this is a game story right now Frank because this is not a real big defensive wall for Cincinnati even guys like Zander aren't all that big at 230 pounds watch Carl Zander number 91 is he loops to the outside he's the guy that forces Wilson into throwing a ball that rolls right off his fingers and Wilson and the Vikings got very lucky that's a ball that just hung up there if there's a Bingle anywhere near there that's an interception 11th play of this drives coming up second down and goal from the 8 12 33 to play in the half Herschel Walker just inside the 5 it will be third and goal Ricky Dixon comes up to make the tackle Walker this season there it is averaging 3.7 yards of rush the league average is exactly 4 by contrast to take a look at James Brooks on the other side he's averaging five point six so Walker that's classic Walker though he's a pecker and a looker he's not a just a bull er he's looking for somewhere to go and you get down that close quite frankly you the gap you put your head down and you try to make a bigger hole they come up tight on third and goal and send Novosel ski in motion and Wilson throws it tended I suppose for Daryl Ingram who was the closest Viking but he was about 12 yards away or look at Wade Wilson that until he's yelling over to the bench I don't know if he's yelling at one of the coaches or whatever but Wade Wilson incensed about five of the rout run and that's Bob snooker his offensive coordinator he goes right to there's milker ain't looking all that happy with Wade Wilson either and that's the scene we've seen repeated a few times and we saw that repeated a couple years ago and all of sudden Wilson was sitting down this is a pressure cooker here in Minnesota as I told you earlier this offensive teams been getting a lot of gas 22 yards field goal attempts is just inside the upright but pylus is three to three and he has despite missing the first two games this season 112 points in 1989 and that's a career high for the longtime Denver Bronco he's the difference on the scoreboard it's nine to nothing when I played football I crunched quarterbacks but now I crunch these JB's pig skins they do pork rinds still going nothing

drowsy when you can't call in sick call on Dristan still going nothing outlasts the Energizer they keep going and going we have four children and our last two children we actually scheduled their birth around Monday night football so we would go to the hospital and we the doctor and I were listening to the monday night football game as my wife was laboring and pained but about the liver our third and our fourth children and I can still remember at the birth of our fourth child Kramer that was after the Broncos for their first touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football our twentieth anniversary season winding up tight in Minneapolis and certainly Steve Largent through those 20 seasons has provided more than his share of thrills what memories has given us 9 to nothing Minnesota is Carles puts it in the air and the kick comes down to the 4 yard line then it's Richard Carey running to the twenty and a flag goes down at the end of the play you know who one of the happiest guys in this ball park is though right now it's Sam Weiss because he's looked at his club not play well at all he's seen Minnesota go up and down this field and all they have on the scoreboard is nine points and now he has seen another penalty to be assessed against his club as well that's Jim Riggs but how many times have we seen it over the years where you have those opportunities early you don't capitalize on on them and look what happens later in a ball game and there is no way you can say the Vikings have capitalized for how well they have moved the ball first and 10 Cincinnati from the 10yard line that sort of sums it up on the Minnesota side line they had the ball almost the entire game and yet they've settled for only three field goals little dumpoff pass the ball back to the 8 yard line after the Walker trade it gave Barry who is no relation to the New England code to change to start and he has really made the most of it Jesse Solomon of course going on to Dallas a Barry was a backup at middle linebacker moving out to the right side and he's become an ethical part of that defense to the best in the league second and 11 from the 911 minutes to play in the half nothing Minnesota Vikings when they go Fingaz wins big playoffs Pittsburgh would be Rock is down to four and a sanyasin trip Chris Coleman he's earned his share he got some help right there but nonetheless for dolmen that will be number 18 you never know when the senate quarterback comes away from the center like that whether or not he was stepped on as he pulls back looked like his right foot was caught could have been stepped on and the bengals without a huddle now going right to the air and a science in with a flag being thrown has it broken up at the 50yard line intended for Magee but there's a flag well away from the play itself on the near side Bengals that time going without a huddle trying to catch Minnesota changing and they'll discuss it Pat Haggerty will tell us again the penalty was away from where the play eventually wound up at midfield because the whole theory of this offense is to catch the defensive team in a change from then on the field they did defense huh that's exactly what happened the Bengals by going without the huddle and that's a penalty that the the Bengal opponents have made time and time and time again this season the rule is hard and fast to have 12 men out on that field even if they're near the sideline they they're stepping off the field there's still 12 men on the field well the smart thing the Bengals said though is they knew they had a free play why not go ahead and go deep go for the home you know the worst that's going to happen is you'll pick up your 5 yards to get another whack third and calleth twelve from the eight yard line when there's boomer calling the play Brookes in motion and a science and under pressure throws into double coverage yard wire Fulmer tried to force one in between two defenders and the result is a Minnesota interception well he's got L know good number 99 coming towards him but the ball looked like it fluttered off of boomers hand it looks somehow that Boomer didn't get anything on that ball at all I mean he wasn't hit when he threw it now watch nova number 99 to bottom of your screen working against plato's suspend to the inside Latos tries to trip him again but still boomer wasn't hit when he threw but yet the ball really floated off his hand and the coverage was great there was nothing there the ball of the 37 yard line here's Wilson going right to the air fly his partner in the scene Carter by Hassan Joel blocks Steve Jordan very wisely pull it off where he good move on a Pro Bowler seaport and then Hassan Jones you got that right Frank great Bordeaux 2 o'clock the Anthony Carter goes over a thousand yards second consecutive year again no bangle anywhere near Wade Wilson along the crossing pattern and this is just all Fayette City cart until right there there's Jordan there's Jones and its first down from the 11 a deep drop but a swing is set up and the catch is and there are the Steelers Keith Lewis Wayne Woodruff they're thinking about going to Houston Eric Thomas the quarterback had the chance to make the play it was he took a shot at him and now we know why Penny's in there good strong running what's he got inside the 5yard line kind of the story of the Bengal season in microcosm last week 61 to 7 and right now Oh 16 I touched on it at the top of the show while they scored 56 points during the season came back and scored 7 they scored in the 40s another week came back and scored 7 the following week and lost both those games and they're off to another horrible start as Rick penny develops continues to develop into an allaround back and some sad faces in Packer Lea a rebate is a rebate is a rebate right wrong now for the first time Chrysler Plymouth Dodge Jeep and evil offered the guaranteed rebate

takes it back out to the 13 and the Bengals can't get anything kickoff returns tonight Vikings again do an outstanding job in coverage Brett Nowakowski leads the charge into the year Championships of the USGA we'll review it for you Saturday Curtis Strange one of us opens backtoback in the highlight that show two Eastern one central three Pacific we've got the beats Bowl Georgia against Syracuse coming your way that's this Saturday at 2:30 Eastern 11:30 a.m. Pacific from the 14 yard line ball is the main motion and on a draw here's brought out to about the 17 yard line Chris Dolman makes the tackle along with some help from Henry Thomas Dorman now with 18 sacks they've got a good individual race going Dolman as a teen maillard has 18 and Tim Harris of the Green Bay Packers is sitting in Green Bay tonight wondering if his lead will hold up he has 19 in the half this season number one in the NFL second and seven it's brown and motion Samson crushers sat at the core by Henry we also get many of those is just a remarkable front floor you don't in double digits with eleven and a half sacks that's number eight for Henry Thomas what could be sweeter than to be a defensive lineman in play for Floyd Peters everywhere this man is coached his front floors have led the league and sacks and again regardless of who they lineup it seems the system works there's Floyd and this guy is going to be a head coach in his league before much longer third down and 19 from the fiveyard line and looking for Roman they can't even give me johnson any extra room Keith Moore leading the fire up the chargedup biking front and this crowd going as their Vikings lead 62 nothing thoroughly dominated a game right now from where I come from practice is called a good oldfashioned butt whipping right here there kick around I think Maillard of course reading the fact that they probably not going to put it in the air third down and 20 figures is going to be the draw he whoa Lee Johnson from the back of the end zone Leo Lewis near midfield contact made upfront in close hunt defense and that will give Johnson some extra rule they won't come close to giving them a first down its fourth and twenty at least he'll be able to go back to his ordinary ten that he couldn't do from where he was a moment ago and his native Cincinnati is still going to stay in tight with their permission that's poor David Huffman a guard has to play on the punt return team he said come on I don't want to be here they will get near the coverage from that formation high snap Johnson comes down with it and it's a good deep kick at his own 40yard line the bangle 14cylinder it was only a week ago that Cincinnati was doing this to Houston oh how long a week must say that's Luis now he takes us straight up ordinarily you think that he's going to take a straight up get the most he can get out of it but he sees something to the outside now watch him pick up the picket line the blue jerseys go flashing by and Leo Luis down the sideline very heady return on the part of Luis 51 yard kick but a 45 yard return first and 10 at the 15 yard line Walker can't get on track stop at the line of scrimmage the Packers of course in Green Bay can only sit and watch and hope sensational season for Green Bay but here's a team that winds up ten and six and could be home next Sunday Green Bay needs this game to get to halftime I mean Sam why she has to go and work some serious magic at halftime for the Cincinnati ballclub and I don't mean Don Makowski second and 10 from the 15yard line and he's taken down by Williams and there's a penalty marker down Frank it's against Minnesota you've been a ball carrier in this league for a long time am I wrong when Herschel Walker is going parallel to the line of scrimmage the defense has already won well they do I mean he is not a cutback runner whatsoever you have to give him a rebound from tackle tackle I mean great on the outside he will not bring it back to pursuit will get him all the time if you're gonna use him that way you got to protect his backside you had to do it yourself as an offensive tackle you get it back to just doesn't have that cutback ability he does not happen he has great talent but that's not one of them he just does not have the ability to plant that outside foot and break break it up field accelerate just doesn't happen bang goes in their history have never won a road game since coming into the league 22 years ago when trailing by 15 or more points then ominous note when they're down by 16 a second and 20 and Wilson throws to the far side intended for Carter on the play you know a funny thing the local paper made a big issue out of the fact that the Vikings have folded in the fourth quarter of this season that was the lead story today and when you look ahead the Vikings have had a lot of leads and one promising note for the Bengals would be the fact the Vikings in the fourth quarter this season have been outscored a hundred six to 43 oh it's going it's gonna be a lot of creases in this fold and yeah better watch your step valor you win a hypo or we've all won a few of those third down and 20 from the 25yard line whether we wanted to or not yeah whoa tip and incomplete intended for Carter and Lewis Billups decked Wilson and Phillips is shaken up on the play just a game of numbers and the Vikings with all the receivers and the patterns just did not have the blockers to pick up Phillips he had a straight shot at Wilson and it is Phillips who is slow getting up yeah he comes on a corner blitz and he's unaccounted for he'll come from the top watch Louisville ups clear the crowd and boy he puts a good one on Wade Wilson a yet I think maybe he underestimates the size of Wade Wilson Wade 63 and close to 215 pounds and Louisville ups fights to get up around 180 and looks like he's working that right leg a little to Julie so Billups comes off Carles meanwhile comes on and you recall Carlists kicked seven field goals in the game against the rams this season he is 29 at the moment he missed the first three games this year prior to signing with Minnesota and yet he's tied with San Francisco's Mike Cofer and Washington's chip Lowell Miller for the league lead and if he keeps this up he may get a dozen tonight let me go for that award too but again Cincinnati dodging another bullet they had a first down at the 15 yard line now they're going to have to settle for a long field goal attempt even down 16 and nothing this thing could have been blown totally out of here by now and then viking team record is 30 by fred so Carles tries to tie that mark well Cincinnati may have avoided the bullet to the heart but right now they're sure bleeding from a lot of open wounds they better get the Fife and drum out 642 to go in the first half it's 19 to nothin Minnesota volcano erupts in South Carolina classroom now let's go inside I be a miss helping teachers teach and bring

screwdriver or cordless screwdriver plus you just have to have a screw loose tango &amp; cash cleaning up ratedr now playing at a theater near you the longest game in the history of the National Football League was played Christmas Day 1971 eighty two minutes forty seconds in the second overtime Gero your premium kicked that 37yard field goal swirling and otherwise unbelievable individual performance by the cheesehead Podolak the Miami Dolphins beat the cheese 27 to 24 that was an AFC playoff game what people forget there was an AFC playoff game that very same day Christmas 71 here when the Vikings were playing in Bloomington it old Metropolitan Stadium against Dallas and it's the last time the NFL played a game on a Christmas Day Richard Carey returning this Wireless check back out to the 23 yard line and meanwhile in Green Bay not very happy right now in the home of Brian noble Don Makowski what can you say about this one so far got a whole set half to play and hopefully uh since they will come back and Green Bay fresh and be a second half to they have the weapons don't think they going though all right we'll find out what happens here on this Drive from the 23 yard line is Esiason dumps went off for Erik Candice the tight end and he's bumped out of bounds by Ray Barry out at the 39 yard line so they begin with about a 14 yard pickup it's good news and bad news for Cincinnati 1 they're used to playing this hurryup style of offense it's almost their regular offense the bad news is because they're such a strong running game the best part of their passing game is play action passing and that's something right now that Minnesota can afford to disregard they can sit back and play the pass and not come up on the playaction first and 10 Cincinnati from the 39 yard line inside handoff Brooks escapes takes it back to the 46 I just love watching James Brooks play here's a guy over a thousand yards and again we mentioned before 5.6 yards per carry he's been terrific through the years first San Diego and there he is he's the only player in this decade twice going over a thousand yards rushing with a 5 plus average and the 5 plus average is the key I mean those are Jim Brown type averages when you get over 5 yards per carry second and 3 that was a 7 yard game and going for brown and he's blanketed Farley staying right with him it'll be third down and three well next Monday the beginning of the new year in the new decade January 1st 1990 we have a bowl fest for you Illinois Virginia starts it at 1:30 Eastern Time that's the Florida Citrus Bowl then Pasadena Bo Schembechler wrapping up his career Michigan against USD in the rolls our gang will be down in New Orleans to the USF fizzy sugar bowl that night Alabama against Miami third down and three pressure on a science in but he gets it away finds the open man that's Eddie Brown for a first down he gets wrestled down and the flag goes down Travis Curtis and berry and berry may have grabbed a facemask no they're gonna call it against Cincinnati Nikki can't believe it we may have push in the back number 85 on the one if it's Tim McGee he's right in front of the play attempting to help Eddie Brown out McGee's going to be number 85 let's watch him he's working man coverage against Reggie Rutland are now right about now he's looking back and he sees that 80 Brown makes the catch and they're calling the push from behind whoa that's that's calling it pretty tight that's coughing hit pretty tight and I think Tim McGee has a right to be a little upset about that man that is a that's a caller I don't see it I just don't see it unless something happened before our cameras are on it but I watched Magee all the way down the field and that had to be it Bengals still picked up the first down his first clock is down to four the play clock 2 1 as a science and gets it off protection breaks down he dumps it into the l know the forest an issue and the closest receiver was Neil Darrell so very close to being in the grasp of Moga wanted the call yoga wanted the call but an important drive for Cincinnati five minutes remaining here in the second quarter that they can go in with something on the scoreboard there an explosive team that has been totally dominated thus far but if they can put something up there we watched them before you know how quickly they can score those outside guys Eddie four out Tim McGee Brooks makes the catch then gets bumped out of bounds by Travis furnace and Brooks looking to Curtis as if to say huh some hit their memory stand up you go down description he plays big plays big he only goes about 180 pounds yeah you too yeah you tell that to Travis Curtis great leverage great timing and everything he does third and five Cincinnati at the 39 five minutes to play nothing Minnesota to stand for Jennings and Jennings flipping a tackle and fighting to the 34 and might have a first down Carly makes the tackle and Jennings who will be used very sparingly tonight need in the kidney last week against Houston and he was very questionable coming into the game tonight that's a superb play by boomer I mean offensive line on a screen pass they have two roles one is to hit the defensive lineman hard enough to stop his rush then you move out to block on that one right there I mean the Viking defensive line is on boomer before he has any idea what's going on in completing the pass to Jennings fine work by Boomer Esiason and then a nice effort by Jennings by himself to get the first down and the way he completed it right in stride to Jennings Ahmet probably gave getting the Jennings anthem just to get that first down which he did the Boomer thought that they were going to be in his face that quickly the next to go looking ahead the Bengals with all of this I max the balls at the 34 yard line course content moving on the right side but the Vikings get back play clock down to three and Esiason to hold it over the middle that leads in a bit too much Rodney had sprung free momentarily with Joey browner providing the coverage second and ten would have had to been dead perfect that's a good defensive play by both Joey browner and Travis Curtis coming back from the free safety spot on his way to another Bowl if we're sitting off a lot of controversy as a holdout early in the year here here's what I like to watch here's Anthony muñoz Chris Dolman Pro Bowlers watch the spin back to the inside bidelman right in his face perfect protection by the night to see the offensive line of Abeka 7:10 here's ball and he can't get out of the backfield as the tackle is made by Kim Clark number 71 one of the reserve defensive linemen you talked about dwelling in anonymity a reserve defensive lineman from Minnesota does just that with their foursome well Kenny Clark had a lot of great years with the Philadelphia Eagles a lot of good years there and just as kept himself in good shape and Floyd Peters again a coach that likes a veteran player third and Tim Esiason going deep for Brandel makes the catch touchdown exactly what the Bengals needed Brown had gotten by Carly they celebrate in Green Bay as the Bengals get on the board here a 34 yard touchdown pass from Esiason to brown own you have to say it again that was so important to the Cincinnati Bengals they had been mauled thus far you knew they had the potential to break loose and this is Eddie Brown who had a ordinary year for Eddie Brown this season a great year a year ago but he beats a Pro Bowl corner in Carly at the corner of the endzone actually Frank he did beat Lee but Lee gave him the inside and expecting some help from Travis Curtis and Curtis was late getting there that's late support from the safety to the inside that allowed Betty Brown to make that catch Jim breech sends it through the uprights the extra point with 331 remaining in the first half those three field goals do not look that big at this point sixth touchdown reception of the season for Eddie Brown watch the right side you see Curtis number 49 he's just a little late getting over there not able to break in on that play and Cincinnati as they can do as easily as any team in the league scores quickly Eddie Brown out of that class of 1985 Jerry Rice altoon first round draft picks all of them this year only 46 receptions in two tonight that's great here a year ago with eight 100yard games he's only had one this season that was last week and keep in mind that came on a third and 10 a key third intent in a situation like this that would be a very key play third and ten with three and a half to go on you're down by nineteen that's exactly what Cincinnati needed the fan touched on something a very important to Cincinnati that is they have not been able to get the running game going and so much of their passing game does come off the play action if you can't run they don't pay attention to the run it's hard to make it work well Cincinnati's going to have to do something haven't done all night and that's hold their ground at the line of scrimmage when the Vikings have the ball the Viking offensive line in their running game has really been controlling it lead Johnston to put it in the air personal Walker takes is about three yards deep and he'll settle for bringing it onto the 20yard line from there we'll the Vikings begin their next drive and they have all of their timeouts left in the first half coming back to Herschel for a moment this man can do so many great things for you he's a tremendous receiver either inside or outside he came here when the Vikings offense was settled and it was designed for Alfred Anderson it was designed for BJ Dozier and that is quick cutting plays nothing from the deep eye formation which Herschel Walker's bury at home at break up a little bit because he grew up on it has always played it he has made the most out of what he's been able to do in the Minnesota Vikings offense he's just not the sweep back from the 20 on first and 10 going deep and finding fragra at the 43 yard three yard pickup on first down we talk about respect they really give Anthony Carter the room they were laying off four five six yards watch Carter now lined up against Lewis Phillips Phillips will have help on the inside from Ricky Dixon but again Billups looking for the deep root five yards beyond Carter he comes down with it before Dixon can get back into it still though Billups so late to react when Anthony makes his move back to the inside Anthony has the body control to stop Phillips kept going first in ten here's Wilson going deep for Jordan and that time the coverage on the play provide number 27 Barney bussy staying with him step for step second down and ten Jordan will be going to the Pro Bowl as the six other Vikings will be a backup will Jordan to Keith Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles or he gets Provo respect he gets the coverage from the back not the linebacker Cincinnati has yet to stop Minnesota from scoring on each of five drives for Carla's field goals and it sucks down 18 to 70 second and 10 from the 43 and Wilson gets dumped back at the 32 yard line Reggie Williams and that's what Cincinnati has to do they have got to pressure the front they've got to blitz they have to make something happen this time it's Reggie Williams look at Reggie gets down in his stance this is the understanding up but Reggie gets down playing the role of a defensive lineman and what happens is up front they let him go they're counting on a back penny comes up and chops in but Reggie Williams with a good hustle gets back up and makes the play Reggie had only a sack and a half all season coming into the game two and a half now and this is final year and look what he has to do to get it line up and defensive tackle maybe it'll keep going for another 14 we think retirement third and 19 in the cakzis made at the 49 yard line somehow someway by Hassan Jones and the Bengals are saying it should be no catch well the ball is 25 yards down the field and the hands of Solomon will cuts if it stands it is still short of the first down by four ball came loose after he hit the ground too many notifications to in another way doesn't mean while we come to the twominute warning well maybe we'll call it to twominute notification let's let's take a look at Hassan Jones there is the ball he goes down and the ball does not come out until clearly he's made contact with the ground good call by the officials when we come back it is fourth in four how do you get real pretty well in a moment we're going to show you that last play before the twominute warning with a different look and we thought for a moment they'd hold up play but the play stands the Vikings to kick scriveners kick will bounce into the end zone and the Bengals will begin their next drive from the 20 but what about that catch or no catch but honest on Jones yeah I said what a good call it was we're going to show you here that he clearly loses the ball before he hits the ground there's the ball see the ball right there on its way out I mean now that's a look that we discovered during the commercial break Kenny wolf Craig Jana feed it up to us now they saw that in the replay booth and yet they opted not to do anything with it it appeared clear to me that the Det ball was coming out before he hit the ground the call would have been either a fumble or possibly incomplete there's an odd circumstance the only reason they had the extra time was because of the twominute warning were it not for that it definitely would have stood correct from the 20yard line here's Wilmer Esiason throwing to the far side and incomplete intended for Tim between bengals have all of their timeouts left 148 to go in the half Reggie Rutland covering on the play will be 2nd down and 10 from the 20 yard line season began with a science elfin question has not been a problem for him he did a good year seems almost hard to believe with two touchdowns would give Cincinnati the lead second and 10 here's Brooks and he gets taken out of bounds by Ray Barry when a photographer really hits it and that is a young lady if I see smiling though that was a real shot that she's smiling how's my hair the natural pot well these are cops she's lucky her hair is still on her head watch how hard she gets hit by James Brooks Wow well I mean that's oh that's a violent collision she did not see that coming at all I hope she's all right prepare the Courage Award tonight this to stay there third down long six here's a science in and he has the first down as he fires over the middle to Tim McGee out to the 31 clock still ticking 133 lead yard pick up and as we said earlier the hurryup office goes the Cincinnati that is their office most of the FNC game maybe that's not very quick and they're having to call it timeout boomer did not have the personnel to match the play and was forced to use a timeout and in the interim wastes at about 15 seconds to boot so we talked about the hurry up offense being an advantage for Cincinnati it certainly was not there they really squandered both the timeout and some valuable time off the clock 1:22 remaining two timeouts left you know one of the things the Bengals did this week to try to prepare themselves for the crowd noise here at the Metrodome was to work out indoors at the University of Cincinnati they turned up the loudspeakers and played crowd noise all week long and as Sam said it's been kind of an enjoyable week for the players because they haven't heard from us the coaching staff all week because we just let them go in practice because we had to simulate game conditions as well as we could coming up at halftime Lynn Swann will talk with University of Miami head coach Dennis Erickson his hurricanes take on Alabama and the Sugar Bowl next week and we will give you the uptotheminute situation in regard to the playoffs as we look ahead first and ten from the 32 Esiason to Brooks he has ruined to Rome and gets after the 41 yard line to pick up nine yards I know Tammy's trying to make something happen but he should have gone to the sidelines he got out of bounds he made a decision to pick up another first down trying to make more out of it or step out of bounds until it meanwhile the seconds tick off second and one and this time Brooks is help out of bounds by Barry stopping the clock with 60 seconds to play in the half Bengals with two timeouts remaining Sam white hopefully taking his team to another Super Bowl and got there last year and came up a little short first things first though they need to win the playoffs against Houston next Sunday we're down by 12 2:44 so I add some change you get at the line of scrimmage again Brown gets open and that's a first down at the 44 yard line tackled by a trio of Vikings and white says give me a timeout again so the bengals now have one remaining with 51 ticks of the clock left in the first half Eddie Brown does not spring to life he's still down on the ground as if he really is favoring one of his legs Rosetti kind of hobbling back to the Cincinnati huddle so now the bangles with one timeout remaining had to wave by Eddie Brown was to Joey browner who's in on the tackle make a lot of friends when you travel the Pro Bowls well Don Makowski and the Packers are still at Ryan Nobles house up in Green Bay watching this game Don wants you to play quarterback a little bit here you're on the 44 yard line and what would you like here what would you run I don't know they're doing pretty pretty well to back him out of the backfield on as long as outside takes too much at once just sort to the back and at least the physical others drive and they'll be fine you got one timeout remaining does that to preclude going down the middle that'd be the easy place to go but can you afford to do it you'll take the three first and ten Cincinnati at the 43yard line that's pork samosa here comes a blitz but it's picked up and the throw is incomplete intended for McGee Tim McGee the closest Bengal receiver and he wasn't that close second down and ten but what happened is two of the Bengal receivers ran into one another boy what a squandered opportunity because they picked up the Blitz beautifully I mean that was a big gamble that time by Minnesota coming up the middle and the Bengal line and backs picked it up and because of a confusion downfield two of the receivers running into one another bloomer couldn't capitalize on it definitely when you see a blitz like that picked up and you figure with Cincinnati's receivers somebody's going to spring break the big boy second and ten from the 44 46 seconds left one timeout remaining for the Bengals son well looks like he's there comes Barry and Barry is the man who forced that incompletion so the outside factor came flying through nobody picked him up and a science and just had to dump it off third down now that's just a signal from Sam Weiss we can only assume that the four means for wide receivers that's it Hillary comes in Kendall Smith is there Tim McGee and Eddie Brown there's ray berry number 50 totally untouched unaccounted for that just happens he's called hot he's the quarterback's read the quarterback has to look right at him when he sees him coming us and dump it off third and ten their touchstone came on a third and ten Esiason fires in its neck down and sanded for McCain the way by Reggie Rutland so the Bengals can't even get into field goal range 39 seconds remaining Frank there's why I wouldn't want to play quarterback Reggie Rutland is getting a nice hand but he Gamble's if he doesn't get this ball this might be a touchdown here's an interesting right we'll take a look at the replay first he look at the break if he doesn't get that ball if it somehow gets through his hands and gets the Magee that's a touchdown well here's a very interesting call now it's 4th down and 10 and they're going to go for it at the 44 yard line it's too long to catch a field goal Minnesota has three timeouts very risky call from this position on the field Esiason shaves throws thud well he picks up 10 yards out during the interception now there is a guy that makes a great sacrifice yep I mean he did he saved his team ten yards but throwing it the Sunwell going out about now that said I doubt he did it on purpose good int but he moved the Minnesota Vikings back about 12 yards on it and it was too much I guess a stun well that the presence of mine to drop it at that point yes I think he's keeping our salsa they're not thinking that out there at the moment well now we'll see what happens with Sam Weiss move now points out three timeouts and the hands of the Minnesota Vikings because the Minnesota field goal at this point is a very big field goal that takes you from 12 up to 15 up watch for number 81 here's Wilson and the cash is made and that Jim Gustafson getting out of bounds at the 47 yard line so the Vikings trying to turn a 12point cushion into more than a two touchdown cushion going into the half 26 seconds left if Minnesota should score if they should pad this nineteen to seven lead a risky risky call by Sam Weiss we'll have blown up right in his face that was not fourth and one or fourth and 2/4 and tan at the war would eat or that's a tough pickup now the shotgun here's Wilson under pressure blitz is on going nice adjustment made that time by Jones Billups wants offensive interference but there's no flag Wolcott clear out upon Smith nice adjustment what an understatement alright nice adjust you don't want to make too much of a fuss about something that's out of bounds but pretty good athleticism there by Hassan Jones and I like that inflection in your voice rise to the kids here more of that 20 seconds remaining second and 10 at the 47 three receivers to the right Wilson out of the gun keeps spending in to block pressure on an Wilson gets sacked at the 43 yard line Latu to attack Aloha the rookie out of California was right there number 96 along with McClendon and the clock is now stopped by the Vikings with 13 seconds remaining Karlis leads the Vikings to pick up about 25 yards for him to begin to think about another field goal attempt career long 51 for Rich now what is the deal he is Kirk loudermilk's brotherinlaw that's correct Kirk Loudermilk to starting center for the Minnesota Vikings and they had a little deal earlier this year I guess something was said criticizing the Vikings offensive linemen and the way they dress and so they strung up old rich Carlos from the crossbar on the goal post and left him hang there for a while I guess it was actually Rich's wife that said something about the offensive line improved that they've got thin skin and when it comes to their wardrobe this one you've got to go way up field on lose your time out try to get caught us within field goal range third and 15 and three receivers are all down there four seconds will be a miraculous catch a few moments ago out of bounds you saw that this one he just went up top side came down with it well this is a textbook that watch number 84 timing Frank look at the timing of his leap right in the middle Phillips is their number 24 up he goes and down he comes four seconds remaining on the clock we just timed it perfectly when he left the ground and right now Sam Weiss is again looking back at his fourth and 10 decision saying oh no how could this be happening yep and again you going from a 12 point lead to a 15 point lead and it's real simple when you think of the mathematics it means the Bengals need more than two touchdowns and here comes Carlos for number five zip shot for him he kicks seven in the Rams game this was in 25 yards and it is good and what a big field goal because now two touchdowns by Cincinnati still has some trailing three touchdowns before would have given on the lead who touched now 2221 first ass is gone under the door i refresh is completely by Nissan the human race and by the traveling you're better off under the umbrella and back we come on Christmas night hope you're enjoying the holiday here in Minnesota some 60,000 have enjoyed the first half immensely as their Vikings try to stay alive trying to advance to the playoffs they lead by 15 rich Primus who had five field goals in the first half spins this one down inside the 10 and out of bounds unless the Bengals can take over at the 35 yard line afternoon here in Minneapolis myself we this is a bunch of homeless kids a couple of hundred of them at the 410 incorporated Learning Center a favor project of Vikings players and their wives and Plus Mike Lynn the executive president hear of Christmas Carol the Chipmunks Christmas Carol I think it was appreciated I think we were all moved by it by the Vikings first and 10 Cincinnati from the 35 and Esiason begins the second half with an errant pass intended for Tim McGee it'll be second and 10 if you're wondering why they didn't kick again remember the couple of years ago the league changed the rule to speed up the game if the kick goes out of bounds you can take the option of having the ball at your own 35 yard line that's what the Bengals opted to do and set up shop there especially the way they've been running back hits tonight yeah second down and 10 at the 35yard line Messiah and he looks first toward the key and then over the middle for Holmen and he gets wrapped up and the play is broken up by Scott Studwell third down and ten you talking punt locking on to someone's done stud well that time all over Rodney Holman I mean he just doesn't get any more than maybe a yard or two separation right there in the middle of your screen at the top Coleman doesn't complain about it nope just good defense and look at the movement by Studwell going right and bringing it down so third and ten Esiason steppin up throws on the run and wide open down the far sideline is Rodney Holman and Rodney Holman who just dropped the least pass goes all the way for a touchdown and Joey browner has egg his face this Becky came off the bench Joey browner is locked up on Rodney Holman and when Boomer Esiason starts to scramble browner moves off of Holman comes towards Esiason and Rodney Holman is long gone rather I don't think good it even have dreamed about getting back into that play could be that he thought science and was going to be sacked sighs I'm scrambling around he's one of the great scramblers but he moves around in the pocket as good as anyone and there you saw 47 he was with him all the way until Messiah started the scramble Jim reaches extra point is good and the Crown has been silenced because in the first 25 seconds of the third quarter Cincinnati has shaved the Minnesota lead to eat Rodney Holman he'll be going to the Pro Bowl again he'll be the AFC starter his first catch of the night that's all made possible by the scramble of Esiason browner's over reaction to that scramble and Rodney Holman staying alive breaking off his route going down the sidelines and presenting a target to his quarterback and guess who this makes very happy yep you guessed it right the Green Bay Packers celebrate a Cincinnati touchdown if I had a CV silver take it to our racetrack drive across country German the flat on the too bad you can't drive the year financial serenity it takes confidence control travelers has been delivering on this promise a financial peace of mind for 125 years with carefully controlled investments with insurance protection you can trust the travelers you're better off under the umbrella its function Butler's final game Michigan sets their sights on a national title when amy pac10 Jeff USC in the Rose Bowl New Year's Day on ABC Sports Zooey brown are angry with himself with the coverage that resulted in home it's touchdown it's 22 to 14 and Johnson's kick is down to the angel and by Walker and let's go back and have another peek at the TD yeah let's look at exactly what happened back in the secondary key mine 235 it's a here's Rodney Holman right here here's joy browner but the key figure is boomer when boomer moves up watch browner come off he'll come back to the inside Holman stays alive and goes down the sideline here's boomer making his move and there's Joey browner he commits to leave Holman gets caught in no man's land Holman stays alive and there's the Bengal touchdown an allpro safety joy Brown are making a move there not befitting his position on the Provo Pro Bowl team getting beaten by a pebble city to the 25yard line and here are the numbers through the first half with Minnesota clearly dominating total yard to set it all of course the turnovers our sensitivities and converted were converted quickly into and also it's interesting to note Cincinnati with only yards rushing in the first half and they are number one in the NFL in rushing offense coming in of course it going against the Vikings on second and five we just happened to be the NFL's number one defensive unit then he picks up a couple to be third down and three holman on the sidelines breath long crashed into the end zone and again as you look back if you were with us early you know that it was Minnesota mall in Cincinnati throughout much of the first half but Minnesota moving down the field forced to settle for five field goals reflection of a storybook third and three from the 27 alfred anderson is in the game as the so set back here with four receivers and they give it to him and he gets knocked down short of the 30yard line so with four receivers they give it to Anderson his first carry of the night and it's David Graham number 98 who stops him and you hear the crowd there rumbling they're booing a little bit Bob Snickers playcalling here in Minneapolis has become a very sensitive issue to the fans there it is take a look at it up front good penetration and then the slide over by grant to make the tackle and the crowd wanting something a little flashier I think it have to pick up a first down that's not always the right thing to do bucky Scribner a wobbly handle a fair catch is called for at the 34yard line carry playing it very safe that time you see head within 15 yards of 37yard pool the place you'd normally see a fair catch here right 15 yards about the question he had sometimes I imagine my windy sedan in Monte Carlo not for a light one of the local fool them my cute you're yelling I think I will you gather round for the holidays there's no better beer to have around than Michelob for our tree at your store and have a happy holiday hello little Karen is your daddy halt to calls at 7 p.m. from LA to San Francisco no I don't want to speak to your doll sweetie I want to speak to your daddy with MCI primetime this 15minute call cost 31% less than 80 and T's regular evening rate but daddy on the phone in primetime lets you save no matter how long you talk to the choice that's right just put the phone down sweetie is the choice on the right MCI primetime real savings 24 hours a day call now get one month free under the tefloncoated fiberglass here in Minneapolis there's there you go back to your structural engineer I'm just repeating what some structural engineer once told me under the dome in Minneapolis and the Bengals are trying to to do it all as they were down by 15 and now down by 8 and Brooks breaks one and takes it out to the 49 yard line a 15 yard pickup and the momentum has completely shifted in this one is Joey browner makes the tackle and joy Bronner's he's hurt boy what a brilliant open field tackle by browner on Brooks if James is able to dance to the inside and get away from Joey browner he might not be caught browner is playing with very sore ribs in didn't I whether or not that's it or not that he's kind of acting that way he's walking legs appear to be alright into tonight the Sedaris or is that a beat'em good open field tackle against one of the more shifty running backs in the league is Brooks breaks him back he's left to go against the grain no way he's gonna take that out to the outside takes it back inside of a right and a browner has to leave the game at the 51st and 10:00 Esiason going deep McGee was working with Reggie Rutland that's fine coverage by Reggie Rutland and he gets up kind of holding his leg a little bit regi is not exactly sprinting back to the Minnesota huddle nice fade pattern down the sideline and this is this is just beautiful coverage by Rutland he's screening McGee from the football just a ricochet shot or somehow a miracle glamour comes back into the game strong safety second and ten here's books 47 and for a pickup of 3 Scots Studwell completing his 13th season in the league makes the tackle s Scott before the ballgame tonight whether or not he was going to come back and play next year and he kind of gave me that shrug and if you know Scott's done it's done well you know that that shrug is yeah I'd like to come back and play as long as I can be productive as long as I don't embarrass myself this guy's always away from doing that 37 from the 47 that's whole many motion fake the ball Esiason after a stumble throws under pressure and has a tip incomplete headed by Joey browner to rule in a sack they're going to give Chris Coleman the sack Pat Haggerty comes over and credits Tolman with grass and control and that would be his second sack of the game back at the 46 yard line there are some defensive ends that Boomer Esiason is going to outrun back there are a lot of defensive ends Chris Dolman is not one of them I don't know there's a quarterback in the league that could outrun for his here's an outside linebacker when he came into this league and spent a couple of seasons as an outside linebacker he's got some I've been to Cosby's I've been too tough lately I'm not gonna say it yeah I'll say anyway that's the sack when we talking about Johnson's cake is fielded by Lewis at the 5yard line and he gets taken down at the 50yard line by Leo Barker I'm sure that's what Tim Harris is saying is he's trying to protect his leagueleading 19 and a half sack he's going what in the world was that but they give Dom in a sack and that's 19 for Goldman the phrase is grass and control I saw the grass I'm not so sure about the control I'm not even sure I saw the greatest well he was barely he was hanging on to his legs I don't think anyone was more surprised at dolmen he had he didn't complain about it yeah that goes Esiason he throws the football hardly control oh no it's not even looking for the sack he just gets up starts to go back to his position may let him know and he does a little celebration dance okay I can't help myself that's a horrible call I tried I really humming I tried complete and tender for Carter by the way in Goldman's tire sack the official score has ruled that a half a sec so he has one and a half tonight I think Henry Thomas was the other guy who was there with him on brightest one and it gives him 18 gasps now he's one when you get a guy who's already just lying on the ground the closer meanwhile is still out see you as the storm safety for Cincinnati second in ten pressures back at the 7yard line skip McClendon dropped and Reggie Williams was able to flush them out finishing two more now that we see what's inside every one of Sam washes decision on 4th and 10 inside the last minute of the first half to go for it he did not get it Minnesota comes back with a long past the house on Jones and Carlos adds field goal number twenty two to seven ball if that wouldn't have happened if it would team 14 game Bengal touchdown would give them in the lead third down and 18 from the seven Jim Gustafson the intended and so the Vikings will be forced to kick and the Bengals should wind up with pretty good field position almost like the two teams have changed uniforms in the first quarter to the third clean out Cincinnati they should get the ball back in field position Wayne Wilson if that last pass was mad at himself because that was clearly an overthrow that would have been a fairly easy completion Scribner of the ends terry calls for a fair cash he's not taking any chances at the so Cincinnati hasn't in Minnesota Territory to go to the third winner to the playoffs loser those with Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf the regular season coming to a conclusion the Bengals have it first and ten at the Minnesota 45 yard line and Eric Paul the UCLA rookie picks up 13 takes it to the 32 Brad Edwards and Joey browner converge on the tackle first in town Bob who was injured often at UCLA the question about ball coming in he was that number well he was their first draft choice so he came in the second round was wouldn't he be durable enough because when he's healthy he's terrific and the two key blocks at time Anthony Muno how about James Brooks from the 32 Brooks somehow burrows his way through that pile and picks up close to six this is what Cincinnati came into the game refers to the Legion rushing the football Minnesota shut them down but particularly in the running game daddy is starting to move the ball on the ground there is tonight for 60 yards per carry now Brooks comes back to five yards second and five from the 25 here is Brooks following ball and he's wrestled down after a pickup of a couple by mark deuce Babak at the 25 yard line and upcoming will be a third and three I always say Cincinnati just run run run the ball a great play action team here on third and three a situation sandwich Cincinnati escort both of its touchdowns tonight please the interior line but they they get to play and they play clock is down to five and Brooks spins his way to a first down and a lot more as he takes it to the 11 yard line Reggie Rutland makes the tackle and every time I watch James Brooks I can't believe he's in his ninth year in the league playing like a young Colt that time Minnesota was coming with the Blitz and they met straightaway blocking out Cincinnati quick with the hurryup offense without a huddle on first and ten from the 11 and Esiason in the Cranston sack with the 25 by Goldman perhaps community so dolmen now ties terrace for the league lead for yard line in his second and 23 feet milord the defensive Sanko Amazonas online replaced by Thomas Struthers and this is the loudest the crowd has been you play clock to three to one and they just get to play off it's a notice to the ground Henry comesss swats it out with his right hand and it bounces right back watch Henry Thomas you'll come in from the left side of your screen to the left to boomer he just slaps it down and one hop right back up it's tough to make a football bounce like that and max Montoya ends up with the tackle at the 44yard line first down as finis picks up about four by Reggie Williams so the bengals had a first and ten at the eleven and the next thing you know it's minnesota ball near midfield halfway through the third quarter the word that comes to mind when you describe this Minnesota defensive scheme is disruptive I mean its penetration it is chaos that they try to create and the other teams side of the ball and they have certainly succeeded tight in doing so to the Bengals second and six Vikings with five sacks tonight off the play fake here's a Cincinnati sack as Reggie Williams who had one and a half sacks all season long has true in what might be the final game of his career and that's the crowd you hear Wilson Wilson was trying to get the ball to Anthony Carter and once again Carter top of your screen was covered well by Eric Thomas he wanted to deliver the ball right there the carnival Thomas was all over Carter this give Carter or Eric Thomas a part of that sack great coverage on Carter Williams comes out on third and 14 four receivers under the shotgun Wilson fires too long Gustavsson well they can do that what kind of a call is that when you need 14 these though at about six yards of field well you had a blitz adjustment now they had no choice Cincinnati comes with the Blitz Louisville ups will come off the near side it's the call is is that Minnesota didn't give themselves an option let's forces a shorter route by the receiver he reads blitz there was not a stellar offensive series by by time Sookie Scribner to kick and this is a beauty these the 12 yard line Scribner yelling that he will roughing the kicker penalty John Holyfield came in there and and dropped Scribner there's no doubt about that but had Haggard in the official there rules that he was blocked in watch this I think we'll see this right over the middle Holyfield continues on through and knocks scribner down we've seen that called manslaughter and a few weeks I'm not saying it IBM presents you make the call Lionel James of the Chargers fields a pun takes a few steps forward and then passes backward toward a teammate the teammate in the Cleveland players simultaneously knocked the ball out of bounds now you make the call where do you spot the ball you can do things with microchannel that other computers just can't handle you got an edge in fire and speed you're a forward finger to dance indeed what call did you make a backward pass is considered a free ball no matter who touched it last it belongs to the team last in possession at the spot where it went out of bounds if I had a Nissan 240sx if your red coupe what no flag take another look here he thinks he's gonna draw a flag well he should have drawn a flag I'm gonna watch the whole of authority this takes out a watch Hollifield Oh Cincinnati has it at the 12 yard line first and 10 626 to play in the third disrupt Esiason here's Paul this crowd isn't helping anybody involved with Cincinnati this is where the crowd becomes almost as disruptive as a Minnesota defense this is where life on the road in the National Football League is tough force over Cincinnati when you say Banda they do so much at the line of scrimmage they change sometimes seventy five eighty percent of the time and they have to change the count they have to get the word out to the wide receivers and they do more verbal communication with the line of scrimmage had most teams in the league or there's Brad Edwards flying in there throwing a forearm second and eight to extend this holiday with you well there's a good look while Carly's going to the Pro Bowl and a bad play to F call whether in his own formation Lee had rolled up over the left side he was right in the face see this huh this was nothing more than keep Minnesota from being here's a little variation what they call the sugar huddle Minnesota tried to substitute that turn around smash the ball he's down to six and this place is shaking assassin fires to the far side and the catch is made by Magee in bounds and a first down Carly providing the coverage he was right there but Magee having a terrific year makes a clutch catch again with the good speed gives it the look about breaks it out on Esiason it's already delivered the ball on that break buggies Oh do not attempt this pass look at that throw by boomer we biceps do not throw that one see from the 24th up line straight ahead after the 27 goes to Kingsbrook for a gain of about 4 maybe you could maybe you couldn't throw a few years of Archie you're doing GMA next week on Good Morning America this week Wednesday Thursday and Friday watch you interview Frank could be thinking about it maybe a nice touch we're not busy the rest of the week don't call us we'll call you what are you Thursday and Friday good job I'll think about you guys as a siphon great play fake freezes the defense and then lost one to Eddie Brown and a first down at the 45 yard line he beats Carlo he could've only estate involves us six points for Eddie Brown the speedster wide open we talked about the playaction with the Bengals and watch decison hide this ball ball with a good fake doesn't give up that fake bangs right into a linebacker in Brown is wide open Josiah puts it in there ball is carrying out that fake right into the arms of Lineback at the 45yard line here's ball going nowhere busting the play up is walking Sabich the ball comes loose they say it's a fumble and he just stood around and looked at the ball thinking it's down Golemon recovers after two Sabich dislodges it it is again that ball is that's a moose that's a holy this Babak cleans it out with his foot thank crystalline just fell on that because of instinct that's the way they're coached anytime you see a ball on the field you get on it don't wait to listen for a whistle not bad for Dolman time for the league lead in sax time for the league lead in fumble recovery bullying straight ahead his Herschel Walker for about five to the 33 are they happy they're happy in the Steel City Pittsburgh Pennsylvania friends in Pittsburgh Chris tonight Herschel Walker do what he can do so well he just carried the pile about five yards it's only an eight Cincinnati turnovers to the Vikings done requisition to come up and take them until Herschel Walker gets to about the 27 yard line and that he's enough for a first down 3:17 to play in the third quarter the Metra doll the Vikings would not host a playoff game unless they got to the NFC Championship game and it would only be against a wild car team he 27 gets taken down just about of the line of scrimmage and Brady 458 and virtually every system he's played has played in a system that has been designed around him for the first time here in Minnesota he's having to fit into a system a system that's not designed just for 34 and 34 alone and he's not really doing it all that well and look at her so right here actually losing the ball before he goes down that's a fumble all the way that is a fumble all the way by Herschel Walker Wilson is able to get into escape the sack they're setting up a middle screen to Hershel Walker they're so quickly that Wilson did not have a chance to let it develop you'll see it though little screen is and tough Sunbury you've got to at least touch those defensive line you got to check their charge initially or your quarterback will never get it off horrendous break the Super Bowl last year third and 10 twentyseven catch me by Hasan Joan Tomasz pudding there that's gonna be a catch Darren's is really shaken up over here Thomas back and airy Thomas's wait up fine football game he gets back into it and he just yeah as Hassan Jones up into the air and I don't know what more you could ask of either the receiver or the the defender on the play ultimate sacrifice some aerial work by Hassan Jones getting up we want him to get up it's good call by the official though he rules that he would have come down inbounds repeated replays about getting up and of course anytime you see a player coming like that on the back of his head in Dec we're seeing the hands the arms everything moved and Eric Thomas saying good deal he's alright release tough game Eric Thomas doing his job nothing intended whatsoever this plays a good tough corner maybe a bit in the shadow of David Fulcher and Lewis Phillips that has had a great season we watched him perform dan styles here tonight B I think is quite obviously concerned about the condition boss on Jones when play resumes the ball is at the 15yard line Cincinnati and Carter begins to graphic as Jones rises to his feet and in a class move there's Eric Thomas all right I think we can go back and savor a great effort by Wilson and Hassan Jones I think John was looking up at the board he wants to see the replay of that he doesn't realize it's already been played five or six times they should give him a private screening though they'd better wait a while I don't think it was a good chord until the moment looks a little shaky there it is again on the board here boy in his head is well you can see where his head is the first thing that hits the third no wonder he's a little loosey first and 10 Minnesota at the 15yard line here is spinning picks up a ballet yard its wrestle down looseball cincinnati ball and the vikings their first turnover of the day Clendon was the first guy in there that disrupted the play and Jason but recovers it take a look at it again girl Xander 91 walk down there at the and his feet around the ankles and the ball comes right to him everybody wants to see themselves on the big board yeah that's right Jason said yeah that's alright that'll work works for me for Cincinnati with Minnesota thief and bangla territory flag goes down after ball gets dropped by milord who had been shaken up and spent the last series on the bench well they're gonna get holding against the Bengals Bruce rhymers number 75 was the man pleading his case I think probably his responsibility to block Millar to begin with that could be the double whammy a play for a loss plus a hole holding over 75 the past few weeks for the separated shoulder you go to the sidelines and you rest for a few moments and you usually can come back we've seen the Lord do just that there's a matchup right here watch Millar take the big move to the outside all this fall it results in first in 17 and the catch is made by Brown and his forward progress should knit him the first down there's the marker and he has to have at the 25yard line you know that was a change by a size and with the line of scrimmage and he gave a hand signal to Eddie Brown as to the pass route that he wanted him to a run we've got someone hurt all the way back down at the goal line that's Anthony Munoz I believe number 78 on what oh what a staggering blow this would be to the Bengals if there's something seriously wrong for this guy the man who in my opinion the offensive lineman of the decade for the 80s and I mean one of the great offensive tackles of all time I mean we're talking in the top two or three and they're looking at the right shoulder this guy is so good he's so big he's six six to 85 and looks bigger you know he does a lot of speaking to young kids around the Cincinnati areas my package they're travelers man of the year of course that is for getting out into the community and working in this man certainly has done that here's Anthony muñoz this is Chris Dolman here's Munoz let's see if we can see what happens Anthony works out of the two points stance Dolman takes the upfield he rides him out of the play and look how smart he is look at how he got the arms up in the air to say to the official hey I'm not holding this guy I'm just riding him down to the ground he has all the nuances doesn't all y'all ready to say that he deskaway he goes out and talks to kids in school he's very antidrug oriented and the kids listen to him he better listen to it I mean do you realize what presence of mind that was to get his hand he realized that his guys going down to the ground and he doesn't want there to be any appearance from any angle of the field that he's riding him into the ground with his arms throwing him in there to get the holding call that consecutive Pro Bowls now for him Assam nine in a row lados who hadn't planes a Walters spot on the other side of the line and right tackle now moves into muñoz's spot with Walter in the game first a Cincinnati at the whoops and nothing develops is excited to follow booth Slimers pin Clark enjoy browner converge on the tackle and we're down to a minute to play in the third quarter with Munoz on the sidelines when you say Dan the offensive schema things well that becomes academic because here comes Munoz back into the game but you're right they're very left oriented team when it's crunch time they they go left and why not the raiders went left behind art shale and Gene Upshaw we have another bangle now now it's a 26yard is Bruce rhymers so left guard so the whole left side of the line on backtoback plays the left tackle left guard as I granted you know that's what they would how they would treat the cramp at the legs and when you see them stretch them out like that there there's a lot of times there's a problem late in the season with cramps because it's cold outside back home you don't get the good work outside there's Bruce rhymers number 75 right on the 25yard line pulling comes out makes us block on Scott stud well I'll check that that's two swapping 59 but you don't get that good work back home you don't get the good sweat you don't get the heavy work that you get during the earlier part of the season and you'll see that a lot you'll get cramps late in the year especially here in a dome where it's warmer than what you're used to it you can see them working on the left calf it all surprised to it he might be on antibiotics be they be onyx because he was suffering from the flu coming into the game you can see Bruce right there grabs a right leg first then the left leg yeah we're having dual malfunction sir and you know what are these you can't move at all that look he's afraid to take a step you have time to time to sit down never have that you know you know when you put your toe up for your toe down that doesn't work either way fiftytwo seconds remaining we're in the third quarter at the Metrodome 22 to 14 Minnesota this enables a song Lucinda converse with Sam white prior to a second down and eight situation Wayne Woodruff is a serving as the host tonight for the neighborhood showing up Dwayne yep so you guys what do you guys think at this point well it looks pretty good we're just hoping Minnesota can come in there and score a few more points for us hey we I have to ask I mean here's your team let's talk about you guys for a second you get obliterated the first two weeks of the season you look like you're gonna go allin 16 you got a chance to wind up in the playoffs how you know we just had 45 guys had a lot of character and belief in themselves and you know we just hung in there pretty well we didn't have anybody else to turn to but ourselves and they paid off our well force people where would be an understatement the way and it was a great turnaround and I think the team that is on the upswing once again well I think so you know we you know have a little rough going there early in the season but as the season went on we have a lot of young guys that came in and did a good job and in our defense to jail force an offense where it's going to quite a few points and consequent when we start winning a lot of ball games and we're sitting here on Monday night hope from it the Minnesota wins one force Minnesota started to build up the points and your whole neighborhood showed up fine when you're on touch ok freezing outside we'll check back with you shortly zoom action here drivers under his own power goes to the sideline in Cincinnati now resumes on second down and eight from the 27 yard line Esiason fires it's tempting by gustave ik marek news papac's native Minnesotan starting tonight only because of the injury to Mike Meriwether the first of his career and like Meriwether a good athlete he was recruited to the University of Minnesota as a basketball player that was his first board very quickly moves around very well and will be talked to Jerry Burns about the fact that Merryweather couldn't go tonight he didn't seem all that concern because of this man mark deuce Bobby one of the big pluses for deuce pabich as we look at the play really being made up front though by Carly Carly's play on the ball wowzers Bobby to come in late so Minnesota from the 42 as Finney takes it to the 39 Esiason his drone interceptions tonight and Cincinnati has three times in this quarter against the league's top defense and it's amazing they're that close turning it over five times against Minnesota accepting some congratulations there he made that all possible while the third quarter is now over 15 minutes to go the Vikings go into the fourth quarter seeking a playoff berth leading the Cincinnati Bengal speak baby and make it third down and eight as we begin the fourth quarter where the Minnesota Vikings leading the Cincinnati Bengals 22 to 14 this is the same guy is it regular and the dog pound instant and Cleveland's brunettes a Cincinnati er Sam why shall yell at me too Richi a man for all seasons third down and eight from the 40 juggled snack but Wilson makes the most of it Dixon takes him down at the 35 they're sure the first down by three at the 35 are you looking at about a 52yard field and they send me in Carles that was going to be an underneath handoff to finis Ric Finney was supposed to take that ball and run it underneath and good presence of mind by Wade Wilson to make the best this outset of a bad situation so you're looking at a 52yard attempt in the longest field goal of Carlos's career 51 keep in mind if they could draw Cincinnati offsides it will be a first down Scribner to hold this kick hit the override hit the upright it had the distance but hit the upright and bouncers back and now Cincinnati will take over at the line of scrimmage which is out of the 35 yard line so they have good field position following the missed field goal but burns trying to play a hot hand or hot foot I suppose we as Carlos have been booming them through tonight and this time he in the distance but not the accuracy bangle ball are you the angel of when you gather round for the holidays there's no better beer to have around than Michelob look for our tree at your store and have a happy holiday my dream car would be a Nissan Hardbody make that the mountainous nobody around cept my girlfriend and a people I'm not boss somebody's got to wash the truck over the years much has changed about the game today the best in the business fly and the airline that takes over 300 colleagues and proteins to their chosen field is United come fly the friendly skies number 2 Miami takes their shot for the national championship when they need SEC Camp Alabama the u.s. 70 Sugar Bowl New Year's night on ABC we touched on this before look at the Vikings a tremendous advantage over the opposition in the first second and third quarters but on the negative side by plenty in the fourth a twoyard pickup by Brooks just to digest it a little further here as you can see look at its core by quarters the Vikings have been building up some big leaves this year there it is again and look at that in the second quarter in particular the tremendous disparity but they've given up a hundred six points scored only 43 in the fourth and there it is plus 143 3 63 in the fourth second down and seven Esiason dumps it over the middle it's Brooks Brooks seeking the first down passive takes it to the 49 yard line first and ten Scott Studwell makes the tackle 22:40 carlos field goals the Vikings changed their defense going off an ice block and taking it to the 45yard line by Eric bull and rain berry spring him he talked about the injuries he had a UCLA now but he was also one of the strongest players they ever had a UCLA set all kinds of strength records and that time he put a crushing bond James Brooks air over his own people second along now has the Wiggly eg for crystal one everybody we're almost got out of it he goes fast Tim Harris another big night for Goldman that's actually Eric catice a tight end who's responsible for running Dolman out of the picture and that's a good call by the official you saw the knee of Esiason on the ground third and 15 look at the Nova from the backside the pace over the middle of the maguey and a first down at the 39 yard line and the Bengals tonight staying in the game because of their third down proficiency they scored twice on third and 10 here a key third and 15 to keep this drive going you see al nogo al Noga got close to a siphon and stopped I mean he he looked like he might have been able to close it at the last second and really pulled up twice you know where to the sidelines like he's having some sort of an equipment problem first and ten at the 30 yard to play crazy for Jennings of the runningback here's Jennings flipping inside and Jennings taking it down to the 32 yard of close to seven Kim Clark making the tackle Saxe now for the one short record 72 cents 1984 Minnesota was seven and two years ago the Bears the seventy the play Beeler and Jennings of the running backs settings spun down at the 28yard line that should be enough for a first down scotch stud well makes the tackle Jennie's we told you earlier from last week's game against Houston Anita's custom upcoming ended I think it gives you an idea of Cincinnati Bengals are thinking that there's no tomorrow if we don't get this one tonight stop the clock right now looks like they've given a timeout to the Vikings is Vegas got Studwell is shaken up he came off the field that has been over Floyd Peters is charged to the Vikings that's their first they have two remaining the clock stopped with 941 debating in the force he goes 100% all the time always has now in his 13th year he's not very big they've got a 16game you have worn down a little bit when you look at Scott and you see him early in this season by the you're right it starts to look like a hockey player about this time of the year the face gets a little drawn you get these struggles to hold on to the white linebacker eyes 2004 the National Football League let's set it again now the Bengals win they host a wildcard game against Houston at riverfront Sunday if they lose its burg is in the playoffs they are at Euston Vikings win they are in the playoffs they lose they are out Green Bay is in Minnesota ahead 22:14 foreskin fence Cincinnati at the 28 yard line Kraig Taylor is the sole setback he gets the ball Taylor running into the official and getting it down to the 18 yard line close to a first down ray Barry gets credit for the tackle and he will come up about a half a yard short of the first have you noticed the difference in what's happening in this game in the first half Cincinnati virtually ignores the running game and now in the second half when they're attempting to gain control of the ball game look how effectively there you moving it right moving it left and getting some pretty good chunks when they do so second and one and going with a new pair of running backs here in Taylor and Jennings after Joseph played much of the game and there's play action one second in short and underneath and wide open and making the catch is tailor busting a tackle hitting it with a clutch down Frank Taylor a rookie out of West Virginia sixth round draft pick of Sam white said we may seem he likes him fresh legs and this made a big difference here in the fourth quarter the RAM in Dairyland for the momentarily I don't even know why I repeated that again a reminder playaction is worthless unless you're effectively moving the ball on the ground but look at the script by Craig Taylor fights off to spa bukh there's Ray Barry with a shot and still he doesn't hit the ground till he gets the ball across the plane what an effort that was I understand that sandwich was talking about tailor well how huge does that play at the end of the first half look now when the Bengals opted to go for a fourth and 10 came up short Vikings were able to move it down into field goal range cashed in for three and right now it's a onepoint ballgame sighs and look quickly into the end zone for Holmen checked it off and goes out to Taylor watch this effort bounces right off this violet pabich somehow controls it and gets the football across the goal line and this is the reactions of Jerry theatres

ticket counter at one point tonight if you joined us late Minnesota led in this game 19 to nothing right now it is Minnesota 20 to Cincinnati 21 the Vikings have scored one touchdown tonight the Bengals have scored three but Carles has ticked five field goals Minnesota leads I appoint winner to the playoffs losers season is over Herschel Walker's back to receive we at 49 remaining in the fourth quarter lead Johnson to kick off with the Bengals Albert Anderson who provides the Hershel takes it back to misty at the 43yard line the flag is pretty well up field and back it will come from that spot a onepoint ballgame and Jerry Burns thought he saw a big play coming his way number 86 on the return a few moments ago he wants probably should not have been a touchdown back up tight end who got flagged for that but most of the run back counts because 10 yards in the spot so it comes back to the 33 yard line and Minnesota has its first antenna again the Vikings this season have scored only 43 points in the fourth quarter barring Thomas who's been really playing extremely well tonight has been all over the field you don't guy in the face without expecting to draw the flag and Eric you can look at that screen all you want it's not going to change and again nos is the fact of Wade Wilson and Anthony Carter were in perfect sync well Thomas didn't like the fact that Anthony Carter didn't just jump out of bounds but there's the problem is is that hands were up in the face you know if he just pushes him in the chest I don't think it's going to draw the flag it gave the impression to the official that he hit him in the head C Carter doesn't step out of bounds he's going to take him on and Anthony even throws a little forum at him but that's legal but that's it gave me impression he hit him in the face when in reality that he first contained mr. Carter and all those fought by Anthony as Eric Thomas batted in and then Carter was almost there to grab the deflection incomplete we almost made it easy for the highlight film people they could have spliced that one right into the end of the Vikings highlight reel I think it was probably why Bob schnell called that play come right back at Eric Thomas he's all upset putting manforman and whatever formation you can Carter gives you a little move to the inside Thomas cut around close up for me almost got it in the end zone second in cane for the 26 yard line somehow someway by Anthony Carter along the sideline Anthony Carter then adjusts is coming back to what he was a year ago for these Vikings last week big game against Cleveland the little out again Wilson under throws a little bit that Carter saves him that's as good as it gets as good as it gets look at this catch I don't know why that's I don't know what's better the cats are the camerawork that looks like Georgie's work great job guys his seventh tax of the night as Benny takes just for a gain of about five the lane okay let's look at that again I mean water Hey how does he keep this ball off the ground I mean you talk about laying out oh that's just fabulous pink bows Pro that's just fabulous voted our engine but he is proud of it your posters how does he do that hey I'm proud of it too anybody likes his games gotta like that second and three at the 19yard line set people in Green Bay he has a first down as he takes it to the third Rick fini not just another blocking back not just another short yardage ball carrier mounted receiver a guy who's been digging for some tough yards tonight and has made some big plays for the Vikings thanks perception first and 10 Vikings at the 13 yard they Anderson infinity of the running back it's fumbled by Fenny he picks it up back to the 22 and Ricky Dixon is there to make the tackle at the 20yard line ball comes loose Xander thought the play was still alive and Haggard he says no sir but let's take a peek well if we always think we'll always see those had been he made a great effort not instead of falling on the ball which he probably should have done he was able to handle the ball get it back into his hands and turn it around get four or five yards out of it what happens the ball is still tucked away so tuck oho looks like it might have come out early that's a fumble looks like skip McClendon got his right arm in there second down and 16 and Wilson's going for the Philips all over Hassan Jones and Phillips is going to get another one if he doesn't get on the officials face to contact past the five yards Gullit shouldn't even be complaining about this he just flat was caught the vac bonehead plays by the Bengal corners first Eric Thomas and now Lewis Phillips that's contact way beyond the fiveyard area real question about the call but then to come back and verbally accosted official I mean you know you're going to get it you know you're going to get it this is not professional wrestling where you throw them out of the ring Lois Phillips to panel days of the seven yard line 6 minutes and 11 seconds to play one Minnesota illegal bump isn't a killer you know that's it's the unsportsmanlike conduct and really hurt to bangles James you've got to keep your cool pressure situations good ball players to be smart Bengals have been penalized 27 yards takes it to the three it'll be second and goal in Sisson annie has the football the original signal is Cincinnati now he's say in Minnesota yeah they sure did he came out of there gave the ball to Cincinnati no one from Cincinnati even argue so they must have never even had the ball he just came up and got disoriented he pulled it to Marshall went the wrong way with him this is what ersal Walker can do for you just take this stack put it down with 230 pounds and just drive people back clearly a fumble was also where he works best between the tackles it's also where he fumbled Russell back like plum Roy third and goal the one did you know I and I'm speechless here a little bit was a was that not a fumble I mean did he not that Herschel Walker and I dropped the ball it was clearly a fumble but recovered by Minnesota somehow a Viking came up with a football we did lose it Vikings somehow got to the bottom of the pile no no Phineas stop at the oneyard line so it's fourth wanna go for what would be a chick shot field goal when you have point lead when you have the league's number one defensive unit you can't get beat by a field goal when kicking a field goal gives you a four point lead have got to force the other team to score a touchdown to beat you my philosophy if I was a the flipside of that year the defense if you don't make it but you should be able to make it if you don't make it you leave him down at the oneyard line well what they did is they let as much time run off the clock as they could the play clock went down to two they now take a timeout with 422 remaining the Vikings are down to their final timeout now they have one remaining it's a tough call either way I mean you could you can't heavily criticize it either way but it's easier to make a decision when you've got the number one defense in the league you're gonna check in with Pittsburgh and Green Bay up with a bus I agree I think he had the number one defense you got to say hey guys it's up to you we're gonna give you a fourpoint lead you hold them you just don't let him in the end zone exactly but we already started domina but I mean the other side if they stuff it in now we got a 29:21 ballgame and a touchdown doesn't even beaches so the Cincinnati defense on third and short yardage and this of course same situation you play your short yardage defense they have done very poorly the statistics very heavily weighted against them perhaps that factoring in to some degree on well if you go for it isn't this why he trade for Herschel Walker I mean it's real simple they've been here before in this hips up he has not been the one that they've been giving it to and they've given it to him on a couple of occasions but he hasn't gotten in they have three tight ends in the game they'll come up on a tight set come up there with Fenny as the fullback and Walker setting up at the 7yard line think it to Walker and loft it into the end give me a break Big Bob smoker who call that play is craps thinking he's movie Ohana's it doesn't work and is popular in Pittsburgh Novosel Ste Wayne Wilson put that ball in the air guys Nowakowski was going to be able to get to it which is doing so it usually is in there here's the playaction a little bit of a Taurus or Walker look at this effort as wide reciever all the way and that is an absolutely perfect throw by Wayne Wilson Novosel skis second touchdown here's Carlos an extra point and irony's Nowakowski started the season with green bay picked up on waivers by minnesota and may have just put Green Bay out of the playoffs time to go or 17 to play I gotta go back to the car Minnesota has struggled trying to get it in newsy walker they've been using fitting this time a little bit of a playaction but a great catch by Nowakowski the former sometimes I dream I'm in Italy driving this incredible sports car my boss is there he says here's where it gets weird the sports car has four doors there's no such thing as a fourdoor sports car it's just a dream right it was Dean winters personal philosophy of success we have a sacred trust to protect our adjusters but its impact was thought on California Street maintained conservative palaces on Lincoln Street and acorn Street to put the interest of our clients first Dean Witter put principles before profit people before portfolios there are many ways to measure success on Wall Street we measure success one investor Dean Witter a member of the Sears Financial Network toss the premium champagne the product the proving grounds STP gas frequent is the age brent Novosel steeply sparingly he's the number three tight end and of course when you play behind somebody like Steve Jordan you will play sparingly tamanna guys got four catches on the year and two of our Dutch sound so down by me Richard Carey is almost as spectacular as the call was well this might be called a tale of four cities because not only are these two teams affected but watch what the catch by Brett Noah Celski does in other places first how about a look at the call in Pittsburgh and of course you can imagine the reaction in Green Bay not nearly as jubilant stealer faithful the Dickensian pronouncement for city I like that Green Bay there's the play that's rich Moran and that hurts meanwhile hope that wasn't a proverbial towel being thrown in the factors us a lot of time left here far away three timeouts left the injured Bengal on the kickoff return Leon looked as if he might have been seriously shaken up initially but before able to get up and fight off as the Bengals take over there he is out of bounds at the 37 yard line nope second and ten didn't get both feet inbounds expect in terms of crowd part of the scene to the running backs and movement as Holman comes across the line boy wait till the crowd gets a little whiff of the fact that they caused that confusion they'll be even louder this time around any to Almond jumping he's trying to give this brown one last Christmas present lay off they go next week off as well second and fifth science inspires incomplete intended or Eddie Brown it'll be third down and 15 just good coverage on the part of the Vikings saya senedd no place to put it again if the Vikings win this game they win the Central Division crown they would play on the road the weekend of January 6 to 7 either at New York or at San Francisco a new twist here the crowd whistling for the penetrating but it is disruptive that's the long and 15 hi for Holmen so it's fourth and 15 they're down by eight and for the moment anyway the Bengals are sitting in the punting unit they really don't have a choice one or two maybe you got to think about it as a as a big gamble but on your own 20yard line you have no choice but to punt it away not even a consideration now put it away and take your time outs on defense says Leo Lewis is back at his own 40yard line Louis of the 45 in the CC territory sake take defense after a 36yard punt in an 8 yard return next Monday January 1st 1990 tripleheader Bowl fest lay me on a busy Illinois against Virginia begins things at 1:30 Eastern 10:30 in the morning Pacific it's the Florida Citrus Bowl Bo Schembechler SH final game number three ranked Michigan against the Trojans of Southern Cal from Pasadena will be in New Orleans for the u.s. F&amp;G Sugar Bowl second ranked Miami's seventh ranked Alabama to wrap it up at 8:30 Eastern next Monday and fighting his way to about the 43 and a second and five in Cincinnati has to spend the time out of course the key now is protecting the ball if you're one of the backs with it you cover it up on both sides interesting damn that Herschel Walker is on the sidelines we talked about difficult to disc to come in do it off is particularly when you were back like Herschel Walker that was born and bred in the I formation me well white is angry because you can see the clock ticking down a couple of more seconds after they had call timeout or attempted to get the officials to to stop the clock and that's exactly what white is saying new look Herschel Walker and his contributions to this Viking team just strictly in terms of what's happened up to this point 1989 trade is a really good deal for Minnesota I mean I'm not saying I can't become that versa Walker may run for 2,000 yards next year but to this point in time he's not as productive as I think everyone thought he was going to be they put three seconds back on the top get outside takes it to the 42 yard line it's going to be third and four they take a timeout meanwhile you when you talk about acquisitions how about the acquisition of Carles and there's white singing guys he came on a timeout stopped the clock it was still running went three or four more seconds he's got a good point it did continue to run for another three or four seconds and they oughta they ought to put some time back on the clock I think they're discussing that at the moment nice tshirt there behind ya take a look at that and Pat Haggerty wisely puts the time back on the clock not appreciated by the Cincinnati 3:22 remaining Sam white I'd say one thing about white you gotta love him he's very outspoken he's very candid but he is sincerely candid and outspoken and last week of course he he poured it on against Houston he said I don't take back what I said I'm just sorry that it became such a cause celeb you know whatever I liked him because you know there are coaches in this league who attempt to be candid but they attempt to manipulate the media in the guise of candor we made a good white white he said I I'm not sorry for what I said I feel bad because I did I'd attracted from from Reggie Williams last game at Riverfront Stadium regularseason game I'm sorry that I kind of stole the show that's not what I intended there's any stock 5x Reggie Wayans last game boasted Houston there you get my drift by the way on the attempted media manipulators now they're saying nothing in which I do not drift along with you I think there was were you referring to someone in particular on the visiting sideline maybe last week in New Orleans visiting sideline I must monitor patience tonight sisters Green Bay you think about this game having started way back in July to a days and how much the legs hurt baked and still affecting us did the three of us talked on the phone back in April and a league schedule came out and we looked at this game and we this might have a shakedown effect all the way down to conferences in the NFC and boy how prophetic that was lucky Scribner into kick 3:13 to play when the Bengals get it back without a timeout as close to perfect as you can get won't do much for the grouse hunting average only 34 yards but no but I might learn about that a contract on it will help out the gross salary yes playoff check appears to be coming Minnesota's way although 306 to play the Bengals have firepower enough to score quickly timeouts remaining Thompson Brooks he gets wrestled down by Barry the 11 rooks takes it up to the 17 yard line berry makes the tackle and that's a first down that's not the way they're going to get it done though unfortunately the gamble by Brooks that he could get big yardage inside instead of sprinting to the sidelines to stop the clock first and ten and that's all the Vikings are giving them the underneath stuff here's Holmen after the 31 and that takes us to the twominute warning the offensive line now this defensive line of many of Minnesota I mean they are exhausted and we've got a player down on the field thanks we got two players out on the field with Henry Thomas and Munoz again and we come to the twominute warning as they attend to muñoz and Thomas you always miss me I had a Nissan 240 out there I get a red coupe no no heck why not chin wall yeah me and Ken and myself know ready for tfx driving into the Sun you only start talking now what we're looking for here is value we're an aircraft management company we want to associate with companies that share our same standards companies that do business the way we do companies have quality here's somebody we've obviously done business with that you are kind of what you surround yourself with and see I don't know how to sell computers I know how to buy them though and I guess that's the significant thing is this the way ordinarily do commercials just the headache feels like a rubber band going around my head I have pain I heard today Darnell Moore is trying extra strength tylenol dough caps for pain like is why take aspirin or ibuprofen when nothing works better than Tylenol gel caps no prob no headache and definitely no rubber band I'm going to go with the gel cap gel caps work titled all gel caps only from tylenol for everyday pain nothing works better and pure cold this winter now try tylenol cold medication Henry Thomas and Anthony Munoz have both left the field there's Henry Thomas number 97 he comes in and you can see his left knee gets caught hyperextended as Keith Maillard goes down you see him immediately clutching his left knee Anthony Munoz went off it didn't was very difficult for us to ascertain what was wrong with Munoz first and ten from the 31 yard line a catch is made or is it no Kendall Smith didn't have control of it but does one official come in and overrule the other the only thing apparently so the only thing I want to pass along about Anthony muñoz is if it didn't appear to be anything with his legs no one fell on his leg no one collapsed a knee or anything like that so for those of you that are his family relatives it doesn't appear to be anything two laminates with the legs and we did see him earlier the game go out with what appeared to be a sore shoulder it's fitting that the year ends with a zebra con for chicken you know well let's face it we've gotten on these guys all the announcer's have the writers this year the whole thing it's a tough tough job there's no question about it well sadly we're in if the feet were in it appeared to me that possession of the ball was made with the feet in bronze and it look at it again you can does he handle the ball saw the possession on the other no question about the feet dragging the left foot that looked like a church to me pal you know your point is right you hate the whip on these guys too much it's a job that nobody wants it's our job that's a good job there the system works system works these guys because that's not really our intent it's just what are we going to do you see him call you disagree with theirs we don't beat up phones by the time you've flogged him on their knees I hate to inflict pain but it's getting it's getting tougher and tougher is what it amounts to year after year from the 41 yard line here's a sizing back to pass and close to Brooks and play is over at the 46 yard line down fortyseven Joey browner gets credit to the cannot stop the clock I've got a big big play here soon lofted to Holmen and he's got a first down taking it to the 47 Barry and Studwell Vietnam attack again on Sunday Rams will be at Philadelphia unless something incredibly dramatic happens here Pittsburgh will be at Houston here's Eric all and they keep the name bounds and the biking players on the cylon are imploring the crowd to get up they want more noise didn't need much help second and ten Esiason throws and there's Brooks and he goes out of bounds a little short of the first down let's not let it pass if Pittsburgh goes to the playoffs I got to tell you a lot of amazing things happen this year but if somebody would have told you the Pittsburgh Steelers would go to the playoffs after the first two weekends of the year you would have had him committed Chuck Noll our hats off here tremendous job indeed and what he was confronted with of sliced up diced up got him back incredible we're also aided by you know a lesser record in the nonetheless Oh into the playoffs they go third down and two from the 39 Esiason throws a massive complete Langly 1 to 10 this 90 to 210 or the composite scores in the Steelers first two games this season they were routed on opening day by Cleveland they were routed by Cincinnati they've rebounded and wind up winning nine of the last 14 and they're making plane reservations for Houston right now overthrowing acuto's around about a few for Green Bay they came back under the Indian Fatih knee they keep your eye on them next year for us and two and Esiason keeps the bengals alive mcgee goes out of bounds at the 23 yard line and that's a first down and deuce Babak is shaken up and holding his ankle I think realistically that yep did they get it in the end zone clock is stopped 28 seconds guys I think I'll take this opportunity to say hey this is our final Monday night game of the year in the NFL we moved to college next Monday night with the Sugar Bowl but this is our last goaround this year thanks again for another great year this is finishing number three for me number four for you Alan number 19 for the ride guys for another move put it that way what a pleasure we've had some great games I'd like to just thank some of the players uh all the players that have performed for us it's been one of the best years I can recall in terms of just the actual games Frank the next time we see you you'll be a little weary blearyeyed from all of those two feedings operated so next what next three days just walk down the street from Good Morning America Joe and Regis and Kathie Lee live you've done Good Morning America deal wake up to do it or you do it at the end of your day just say that's what I figured I'd try to both ways I think the first one works better just stay up roll with it the later you'll be joining the we help you we start by thanking Kenny wolf our producer and great jenoff our director is all the way down the line in the truck you the very best we will the credits at the end as we wrap up year number 20 and Cincinnati meanwhile sighs to keep this going on first down and into the by Darrell phone even well that would have written a complete finish to this one instead 22 seconds remain boomer tonight is 30 and a 51 and that's why this game is over three and a half hours long not what they came in to do number one of the league in rushing the Cincinnati Bengals and they put the ball up in the air that many times that's not what they're about no but I think it's also a credit to the defensive team of the Vikings they take a lot of things away from you the front four of the Vikings tonight has been sensation Masaya sees throw is short and we're down at 18 seconds I'd be very surprised if Floyd Peters the defensive coordinator of the Vikings isn't one of those guys gets a long look there's boy gets a long look at some of the coaching vacancies that are out there now and almost surely will crop up again in the next couple of weeks a yearly ritual this guy is ready sergeant rock his players luckily goes wherever he's gone the past Russia stands for medical third and ten and his books who gets bumped out of bounds that stops the clock with 13 seconds the fourth down coming up McMillan covering on the play so the Bengals to the Super Bowl last year and right now on the verge of being the only team in the AFC Central not going to the playoffs back to training camp you think back to that final drive by Joe Montana taking the Super Bowl away from the Bengals 2016 Jews in Pittsburgh for today Lag is down and it's close by brown for what would be a touchdown and we'll see about the flag Keith Maillard got manhandled into line of scrimmage I don't know if it was a tripping or a hold or whatever yeah they're going to call tripping yep the fear of the Lord is going to come out of there more does he get a bigtime leg whip the celebrating in Pittsburgh and I think on that last call there celebrating will Hanson Vegas is celebrating the other half is funky here comes from alarm listen I had this playing with a separated shoulder leave almost 15 or three times a game with the steam look to the right look to the right watch my heart try to come out ooh and here's the trip that's an unidentified bangle on the ground has had a tough go around but again he's playing and Keith Maillard is tired and it nullifies a bengal touchdown wisely pulls up and hits Eddie Brown and ends with four seconds left barring a defensive penalty this would be the final play of the game who we're going to have a defensive penalty because the Vikings had jump Esiason just throws it up for grabs the pass is incomplete but if the call is against the Vikings there's still a play to go outside defense one more play is still intense interests around the big screens at every sports book in Vegas right it's amazing on the rise how many people have remained here you're right the Vikings were I believe five and a half to six points depending upon where you were a Bengals score right now Vikings are armed with the Gatorade that could mean only one thing watch out girl that's the 25yard line a good guy Jerry Burns Hunter will be a genius last play of the season into the end zone and into the playoffs go to Vikings and Byrnes got it and the Vikings unbeaten at home this year they go 8 no under the dome and 13 consecutive wins and for all intents and purposes so ends the first round of the playoffs Vikings get a week off Bengals get about seven months off Steelers they go right back to work tomorrow happily Green Bay great season for the Packers but unfortunately ten and six just doesn't do it in the NFC central no but we're looking at a team right there the next year I fully expect the challenge of Vikings for that ground clearly an upandcoming ballclub there's your final score Minnesota wins it 29 the 21 meanwhile let's take a look now at the NFC and the complete and clarified playoff picture for you Rams are at Philadelphia early game Sunday divisional playoffs now the following weekend if the Rams win that game the Rams would go to the Meadowlands to face the Giants and Minnesota would go to Candlestick to play the Niners if Philadelphia wins the wildcard game Minnesota goes to the Meadowlands regardless of what happens in that game Minnesota plays on the road if Philadelphia wins Philadelphia goes to Candlestick in the divisional playoffs the weekend of the sixth and seventh the AFC quite clear wildcard game is Sunday at the Astrodome Pittsburgh against Houston on New Year's Eve buffalo meets Cleveland the following weekend whether it's Saturday or Sunday has yet to be determined Denver is at home that weekend be it Saturday or Sunday they will me the winner of the Pittsburgh Houston game at Mile High Stadium home field advantage belongs to Denver throughout in the AFC to San Francisco throughout in the NFC with the Super Bowl January 28 at the Superdome in New Orleans and we've been checking in all night Wayne Woodruff has been hosting a major party at his home in Pittsburgh and congratulations sir as you guys are on your way to you stand share some thoughts will explain this burg and you were great to be in the playoffs and looking forward to going down there in ballon Houston so you guys will be down there in the late game now on Sunday and I mean be honest with me when you you get outscored 90 to 210 through the first two weeks of the season I mean that you couldn't have even dreamed about this you know we still had a lot of confidence in our football team you know we didn't play like we were that good the first two ballgames but we knew we weren't that bad we regrouped and 45 guys came together and is paying off for us now some people said Chuck Noll may have lost his magic I think Chuck is still a pretty good magician isn't he well he pulled off a good trick for us this year but you know he's got 45 good players and some other good coaches that are making things happen and we're playing playing very good now your thoughts about Houston right well obviously you know they beat us twice this year broke down down there and also in Pittsburgh but you know it's a different situation now and we're gonna bring a little bit more heat than we two times all right Thank You Dwayne and thank you for having us in your home on this Christmas night and we hope it's been a very happy holiday for all of you and our thanks to the Green Bay Packers we're letting us into the home of Brian noble tonight share fever fans and that's exactly the way he had hoped
