============================================================

after a oneinfive start who wants to play the Colts right now the 10th time in 11 weeks the Colts are victorious our home stays hot Patrick mahomes sets another NFL record and it looked like this in Kansas City over the last 24 hours the temperature is holding steady it's 30 degrees feels like 22 the wind is light light snow expected to continue throughout the game so what are the elements like down on the field let's check in with Michelle well there was a tarp covering this field from about 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning before the snow started falling until about three hours ago and there is a hydronic heating system here that is designed to keep the field surface temperature at a minimum of 30 degrees Fahrenheit to keep the field from freezing I talked to a number of guys about the field conditions and most of them put on a good face set all the right things but it was 23year veteran Adam Vinatieri whose legend began in the snow who told me anyone who tells you playing in the snow is no different his line on the engineer affront shoots wide reciever Sammy Watkins will start after missing the last five games with a right foot injury with safety Eric Berry is out as his Colt safety Malik Cooper out very big meanwhile part of the tradition will Shield's the great guard in the 90s and first part of the 2000 in the hole spend his career here in Kansas City with the Chiefs getting the crowd all riled up early on he'll bang the drum get everybody going at Arrowhead Stadium home of the change since 1972 and you've got the check and that normally happens here is the horse warpaint comes out but he's not a Mudder so they're keeping him in the car today jeeps won the toss they have deferred Harrison but Kurt will kick off and Indianapolis will get the ball first Zack Pascoe back to receive so in the Kansas City place here next week or if Indianapolis wins they'll go either to New England or Los Angeles and away from Kansas City Maskull gets to run it back from the two yard line when the coverage is good they take them down at the 22 yard line is to me Sherman is there and let's take a look at the indie offense Andrew watt Stanford University Monument and University of South Florida CY Edison elf are you Donna Inman University of Virginia Eric Ebron hi I'm a Tar Heel Brian Hewitt Stanford Anthony Costanzo Boston College Quentin Nelson Notre Dame Brian Kelley Alabama Marlo Smith black walnut college Braden Smith Auburn University rookies on the defensive line they've done a great job Indianapolis allowed the fewest sacks in the league and they begin with a run and a threeyard loss these toward is right there to stop Marlon Mack in the backfield good beginning for the Chiefs it'll be second down and 13 D Ford is the guy you think of as the pass rusher but these are the kind of plays the Chiefs are going to have to make in the run game today because now when you make a big play on first down it sets up their top pass rushing unit to go get Andrew Luck crowd already in full throat second play of the game second and 13 and a toss back to Mac and Mac has some room Gudrun he goes to the 28 yard line and a terrific day last week in Houston and they go from second and long to third and short one of the key guys on the line of scrimmage is number 14 Zach Pascal he is going to be the guy in many cases that has to make that key block there he comes down with the crack back block on the edge and sets up that run to now he make them a little bit more manageable at 33 Dontrelle enman for the moment is going to line up in the backfield then he goes into the slot on the left Kansas City getting repositioned on and luck throws and that's incomplete intended for Eric Ebron throw a little low and so Indy begins where they bring it out and that means Tyriq Hill is going to go back to receive the kick Rigoberto Sanchez will put it in the air for the coach now one of the strange things is this snow can actually get in your eyes on occasion and looking up can be a bit of a danger it's going there's no question he backs up collects it and he flag is down he goes down but he wasn't touched so the play is still alive but there's a flag down all the way back upfield and he takes it out to the 50yard line but John Hussey is today's referee Anil Lewis in the conversation going on in front of the the bench penalty is going to be against Kansas City during the kick holding the sealing team number 39 now 17 will be a force happiness first down Trevon Smith are in Kansas City has the ball let's meet their offense Patrick mahomes the second Texas Tech University today Mia Williams Mira Mesa high school sorry Kia Pierce enjoy engine Sammy Watkins Clinton Chris Conley Georgia Travis Kelce Cleveland Heights Ohio Eric Fisher fire up chips Tamron Ervin Florida State Mitch Morris Missouri Andrew Wiley Eastern Michigan Mitchell forts and Carroll which is Schwartz once again this year has not missed a snap the first player is a fake and then the pass is caught by Tyreke Hill and then again with an 11yard gain on first down but you've heard the phrase a lot this year this is an RPO so they're gonna read it the run game off to the left and that moves the linebackers just a bit throw the sling right in behind Allen anytime to get somebody like Tyree kill the ball in the open space very very very dangerous duly noted Holmes his first postseason past in 11yard gain the running back is Damien Williams to go to accent upfront cause everybody signals it's the other guy which was on the traction Nico Autry came across the line so Patrick mahomes they sent Alex Smith to Washington he took over on opening day 50 touchdowns it's happened only three times the Peyton Manning Tom breaking the other guys to do it and a one thirteen point eight rating which is terrific first and five and Williams fighting his way so honest people are going to rule the forward progress is down and so is the official coming into spotted third and short and make it to make it second down and short as we meet the Colts defense Jabbar share University of Pittsburgh Denis go out to Albemarle high school with Marcus hunt and some you I'll fight deen mohammed do you Darius Leonard South Carolina State Anthony Walker junior Northwestern Kenny more about off the state clayton gathers University of Central Florida Georgia you see a peer to zero Linda wooden University once the Roseland University of Florida near midfield the Kansas City firsthalf anymore Layton gathers knocked them to the turf this would be my number one concern today you play a lot of zone defenses and Travis Kelce really understands how to work those little vacancies in that zone and so it is going to be one of those games I think with the Colts are willing to give up some of those short plays but you see the to keep safety back deep there's just no way they're gonna let Tyreke Hill get behind this will be watching top of the screen flank to the left it was the last five means with a foot injury spreads him out after backtoback first down back into the action benefit run takes it to the 20yard line JJ Wilcox locks him down but there's a flag and then maybe more yardage tacked on here could be a horsecollar he got it from the back here's Hussey during the tackle Cristiano thaw for Spartak wall about it first out and it's the former a cowboy will con so they're in business or the seats so good to see Sammy Watkins back in action again after that foot injury and he was making some magical plays and practice the other day we got a chance to see him maybe this softer field helps him but you've got to also begin to think that Darius Leonard sometimes can get fooled in zone coverages that time chump Travis Kelce in front of them let the cross run behind first and goal at the 10 yard line the space that's it back so dusty techsavvy city Damien Williams and he has come on after they left Kareem hunt go he broke a tackle by Anthony Walker and just like that the Chiefs are on the board the Colts love this look where they put those two defensive tackles in there but watch what Morris and Irving do here they're going to have those down blocks and it was the athleticism of Williams in the open field that got him in so the mastery of the Kansas City Chiefs on their opening two drives continues they have buried teams in the first quarter five flames 90 yards buckers kick is good to three minutes ten yard run the Houmas was three for three for 61 yards on a scintillating opening drive seven of the casing Tuesday Jimmy Fallon will join linmanuel Miranda and Puerto Rico and then back in New York Brooke is a great array of guests including Jada pinkettsmith Don Cheadle Howie Mandel from America's Got Talent Tonight Show with Jimmy knew this week on NBC at the communion station here in Kansas City still lights no supposed to have it throughout the course of the game didn't bother the homestand the Kansas City Chiefs on the opening drive and this pick stealing from before to the 26 he comes as we take a look at the caves of City defense Cristo listed estate derrick 19 Florida State alum Bailey University of mine Justin Houston George Anthony Hitchens Iowa Reggie Ragland Alabama D Ford Steve Nelson Oregon State University Jordan Lucas Penn State Daniel Sorensen BYU tender fuller the do you said the Kansas City defense they've been in the crosshairs this year 31st and yards allowed second worst in the league they were 27th against the rush 31 against the past but got off to a good start today with Indianapolis going through play action good protection for luck but then it is battered at the line of scrimmage by Chris Jones big number 95 will had a come out of last year's wildcard game against Tennessee with an injury and wants to finish this one on a high note today well Chris Jones has had a tremendous year this year matched up against Clinton Nelson here and this is that formation that the Colts like they love having the jumbo formation extra inch of lineman Nelson helped his own but it was Jones just sweeping the sixfootsix Jones he had four blocks to lead the team during the regular season second down and ten take the Mac let dancing around that's bad and then complete that was Justin Houston getting his hands on it so Andrew Luck back in 2012 the number one overall draft choice out of Stanford then off to a really good start in his career but then you know the rest missed all of last season shoulder injury didn't even know who could come back to play football but his passion back thirty nine touchdowns and of course he and Frank Wright performed a max made in quarterback Kevin third of ten what Stepanov fires on the run that's bad is almost picked off so all three passes were batted sir arias ward is there on the defensive end and that's another three announce port down the protections really been perfect all day Descanso on the outside is taking care of houston but then on the back end they are not winning the battles down the field right now we have just seen the young Chavarria sward come up with a big play there on the outside and he has been a replacement second punt this is angling toward the sideline bill bobble collects it and gets tackled at the 30 yard line with nine and a half to go in the opening quarter cheap seven Colts this is gonna be one heck of a competition agent e that champions Monday followed by mannafest on NBC Applebee's allyoucaneat is here now that's even good in the neighborhood Andy Reid is 20th season as an NFL head coach Chris was talking about this first two offensive drives 16 touchdowns scored this season seven point font yards per play best in the NFL they looked like it I mean the home was really nervous on that first drive wasn't never he's never played in snow told us the opening day white snow here field big decency he starts the second drive here fake to Williams and looks for but it throws that one Williams that's a nice bet but can't go anywhere very short game one of the things you'll see the Colts do a lot of in this game is had these two big defensive linemen right down front and center and they try to sort of make you block them with those interior three and create one on one pass rush matchups on the outside against the tackles but unfortunately so far not much of a pass rush at all in commodities here to see who really had a nice day last week in Houston took care of me Andre Hopkins covering third down and six and from a home she just get the feeling that after that three interception game against the Rams in week 11 that it got his attention and that he really started focusing in on being safe at the ball even that throw their lower half of the body let's not get any tip balls out here for interceptions where's his body what else is new tyrita makes the catch we've seen it all year long first down Dana ten I love watching this kid play just got to roll the right escape pressure how in the world was even looking back in there for Tyree kill just mvptype throws I mean you just simply have to say it in and it doesn't look like anything bothers it when you talk to the Chiefs they all talk about it but nothing seems to faze him and what about Claire believe me it won't the protection fires that's incomplete intended for Tyree he'll just missing and it's second down and ten of course he grew up in a family where as that was a major league pitcher for eleven years so he's been around a few club houses he threw a strike on that one to that hill just unable to come up with there was a great route by Hill on the outside against this year and obviously got to play the speed right on that cut can be much better than that with the throw and there is Pat mahomes on the right 11 newsmen Agee starting his crew at the Minnesota Twins most of the Red Sox pitch with the Mets the faith and that's off the fingertip to see me walking complete sentences which need my for third and ten watch how long the homes sits on this play fake I mean you really is a linebacker that's thousand thirty seven thousand thirtyeight right I mean you got to come up and play the run at that point one more time two in a row right through the hands of his receiver he's left unwell for the quarter scoring in the opening drive and the pass is incomplete that that was a free play in all likelihood when she wasn't covering DeMarcus Robinson it was third and ten well I've got penalty third down now could need Mohamad so that was a free plan that makes it third down and five now yeah they also caught the Colts in one of their favorites this slot blitz coming off the edge did it 14 times in the game last week but for my Holmes here he is it's third down in ten all the pressure of playoff game he's going to the hard count he's doing the little things that you would expect from a veteran quarterback 23 years old start sarong get there doesn't look like he does the 47 and they're going to be the yard shy of the first night of course the crowd wants Reid to go for it wouldn't be surprised to be did on fourth down and one and they send a full back into the game that's Sherman but you've got probably the most athletic of quarterbacks back there in the backfield so you have to have some kind of spy or something defensively to take care of the middle of the field running back Josie goes to the left side Sherman is the pull back an extra line that there to first had a Damien Williams gets to the 36 yard lines and no surprise that Andy Reed goes for it pays off first down at the 37 Colts got beat on a stunt that time they tried to stunt inside and run the linebackers this way and it just left a gaping hole in there there simply wasn't anybody left sit there and watch Mitchell Schwartz he didn't know what to do he was well down the field and was trying to get him to go blocks up but Damien Williams is a good story they toss it back here touchdown 36 yards for a guy who can score anytime from any place on the field not only is it going to be a reverse it's going to be a lead reverse so they're going to bring Harris around with them to take care of the one guy out there that still had a shot and he'll and then after that we have seen this movie too many times before you get him running towards the goal line starts out as a horror flick to the coach drives snores what go for the extra point that's good and we played even hand minutes in this divisional playoff game and the Kansas City Chiefs around front 14th and nothing in our head one of the things you have to worry about with Tyreke he'll when he's here is running this way now you got worried about him running that way too it really doesn't matter which way that speech starts running it is a boat load and so far the Colts looks done there our guy is not even in position to make plays down the field right now the biggest thing that we see out of Andrew Luck is a drive they keep this a ball game but last week it was the Colts that got off to a hot start scoring on their first two drives and Houston never looked back one thing 217 had the reverse today facility comes to first you have it thrown out the turnable kick short it smothered at the 23yard line is Jordan the Wilkins it's look at today's quarterbacks being brought to you by mass mutual Taylor Texas cubies Andrew Luck grew up in Houston patch with the homes and these Texas town of Tyler pro athlete that's Oliver Luck NFL quarterback he went to the University of West Virginia played five years in the NFL home the dad of Patrick baseball 11 years 89 combined touchdown passes this season balls for any playoff game in the history of the NFL so Andrew Luck has started the game old for four boats over six plays in seven yards try to get the running game going they hear the vice run through the middle by Marvin back in his second year out of South Florida him seven so they and eread Patrick mahomes you know we talked to that Reich and luck as a match made in heaven but what about a read and the Holmes it's been amazing and the great thing about the Kansas City offense is they hit you from so many different directions I mean you think okay we're going to take away the deep game and they hit you with a reverse for a touchdown I mean they have just sort of Zig when everybody is Zach all season long second core now the one people on the ground again give eternal man it takes it out to the 32 yard line he poured in on the tackle layer third down and one right now the Chiefs are catching them around the edge so what Frank Reich would like to do is get these big offensive linemen going down the field but Ford is coming so fast around the edge as Mac sort of delays and waits on that block to take place they're getting caught certainly defensive coordinator McCain's and City meanwhile luck spreads him out here on a third and short too there's an escaping yes but outofbounds and banged out of bounds let's around for a flag Justin Houston makes the tackle there is no flag and that is a third consecutive three about how the protection has been good they're just playing mantoman coverage down the field and look at nowhere to go with this Paul they tried to bring their back Mahim Hinds in there to run against the linebacker he couldn't get open this is almost stunning as well as the Kansas City Chiefs seeing all the numbers about what a tough year it's been the secondary also that Guzman had was pretty close to drawing the flag and you have a fair catch call for the 26 yard line here my diary kill for 12 left in the quarter 42 nothing Kansas it that Kobe fence led by Darius Leonard a rookie 111 tackles most in the NFL rookie to lead the leak since Patrick Willis of the Niners didn't know seven he's a kid who grew up in along with his seven sacks for forced fumbles grew up in South Carolina he was dying to go to Clemson but they passed on he went to South Carolina State played in a couple of championship games if he had gotten there but he has been simply sensational all season long no question the energy of this cold defense so it's this Drive where the past that is knocked away and it's Kenny Morgan coming in on the Blitz who's able to bat it will be second down to ten well there's that slot blitz one more time and when naked in trouble or they get behind they'll end up bringing him on the Blitz and that time able to get his hands on the football because now you want to come in you want to play his own defense you want to keep everything in front of him but keeping everything in front of him that hasn't worked either existing easier said than done there's a little dark Kelsey that's a first down at the 40yard line those fastballs curved sliders related changeups everything I mean he's just sophisticated with what he does to when he takes off the run look at his eyes he's downfield he's going to look but he knew exactly where he was going to go the whole time he does the pump fake to slide the zone defense that way and get Kelsey open he's a brilliant young player he really is six out of ten with a couple of drops in my yard so far the Chiefs have already gained 154 yards intended therefore tiring he feels let's take a look at starch so far by Darius Leonard and this is what happens to you in his own defense you hit a little out there to Kelsey so what do you do the next time he does it I'm gonna jump that here comes the crosser hit one and if he has an issue that is one in coverage and now here he is trying to stop this touchdown but really no match whatsoever for Andrew Wiley down the field so not a great start for grape Flair Clark and that's Topolsky again 103 catches that was a franchiserecord and the one vulnerability on that cold defense would be giving up a lot of passes to tight ends well even when you're playing man coverage against them you forget how fast this big guy is he has the ability to get open on those deep crossing routes that usually are reserved for wide receivers and then the ability to take a hit like that from JJ Wilcox allpro again this season along with his brother out of Cincinnati and he has been sensational every year put on a roll with an action tomorrow we're filling up against New Orleans and meanwhile now you have a timeout taken by Kansas City and we'll be back to Arrowhead 30 seconds Kansas City's number one of the league in offense within yards and points good measure thanks to a couple of guys right there under three catches ten touchdowns from Kelsey Hill 1479 yards each with over 1300 receiving yards 10 TVs in one season after the timeout that giveth the hill season bounds around the corner its likes to a stop in for a gain of about seven well we've seen them attacking with the crossing routes but I think the hardest part about Kansas City's offense is what you just saw right there and that is the horizontal stretch that Andy Reid can put on you so everybody's scared to death of getting beat over the top by this football team but then you put that horizontal stretch on them and you're trying to put 11 players so they go eastwest northsouth they go Southwest to Northeast they're on every airline there is and there is the man trying to figure out how to stop it Matt ever if loose in his first years the defensive coordinator no question about it but I've got to think that he thought at least it would be a bit of a shoot out from his offense and so far his defense has been on the field the entire quarter because the offense really can't get out of their own way Chiefs have nine first downs and the Colts ever gone speaking throws and then isn't complete Demetrios parish the number two tight end sideline so it's a fourth down they went for it on fourth and one earlier that was paid off with a touch sending a tarik the enemy the offensive coordinator on the left and Reid going over that mammoth way she when the home starts rolling out and just kind of hold your breath you know something's about to happen at that time you even fooled Harris and stepped out of bounds too early but here we go such a big hold last time it would just go right back tip it up again spinning his way for a first down to the 31yard line goes Damian Williams but they haven't missed anything in that ground game since Kareem hunt who was among the league leaders in rushing was let go well one of the concerns you had going into the game was that these guards may not be able to hold up against the Colts but Wynn has been no problem so far Andrew Wiley doing a nice job in there he replaced long demon a car thief the right guard position came in Irving back in now at the left guard Williams the rookie out of LSU is the running back he takes it to the 29 yard line he's tackled air by Kenny Moore locked down to a minute left in the opening frame impressive play by Kenny Moore we see him coming off the corner he's probably their best cover guy on the outside that slot blitz that he does he's just one of those guys that has been overachieving his entire life not that big a guy so the first quarter Kansas City gained 185 yards and the Colts gained 12 and that is the end of the first quarter at Arrowhead Stadium the score Kansas City 14 Indianapolis nothing and this divisional playoff game continues after these messages today Skycam coverage is being brought to you by Geico now Michaels Cris Collinsworth and Michelle deployed Kansas City one side at first quarter 185 yards 212 Kansas City another good drive going here this will be the tenth play of the drive it is second down and eight from the 29 yard line Holmes will fire inside the file again tyree kill was his target third down I don't know exactly what happened that was a scroogie coming out of there that one got away just a little bit just take a look at this motion he kind of flips it out to the side a little bit and then let's see what happens to this ball cause it definitely got away from even saw Kelsey in an interview today talking about Allen flutter went out there every once in a while but whatever it's doing it's coming fast the left side lines opinon kelsey and he'll pick up the blocking necessary to home to change again before he's tackled by JJ Wilcox well the eye candy gets them again right you have the fastest guy in football and Tyree kills going to come in and loop back around and the homes gonna look at him and then what are you do you go screen away whenever you have nil doing all that that you don't pay some attention till nice job with that block in the backfield to make that an easier throw to and you reading the screen game pretty face their first night now at the 19 yard line and look out this time they get to him they get to him for the sack here jabal sheared is able to put him down so it's the first time they get to the homes in this game that'll be a sack of nine yards to make it second down in nineteen again because there's defensive tackles are playing so tight it means one on one for those tackles that's outside this time Mitchell Schwartz who was an allpro got beat inside but you ball Shearer probably their best player on defense stopping the play the crowd wanted a free play but the official came in and stopped the play there was contact when he jumped across Marcus hunt just so impressed with the way that mahomes goes with this hard count he's not snapping his hands or his head to draw a penalty on himself but we have already seen multiple times as defense jumping around this is boys very well and he's able to throw that one away look like lefthanded as the Nico Autry got in there of course he has completed lefthanded passes this season just wanted to get rid of that and flexing it and it's a little scary sign for this crowd of 75,000 there's only one story now what happened to this knee he is really left getting rid of it will be third down at 12 he's gonna stay some discomfort pretty good here with Danny for that Kenny more is there so he comes limping off the field he looked ok with the play there didn't he it took off and made some kind of a play out of it so you probably want him to go talk to the doctor by know him if the doctor would go and talk to him I'll be talking to the doc Harrison but canal 39yard futile attempt he said a record most points the mr. pushes like a lot of seats is to kick extra points and a few field goals this year as well and that one's good from 39 so 1213 to go in the half Chiefs extend their lead 17 another this divisional playoff game being brought to you by Bud Light reminding you that drink and ride your horse by subway now delivering to your front door by peloton live studio classes in the comfort of your home and by Hyundai official sponsor of the NFL Super Bowl for thanks Ram and his team matriculate the ball down the field as the chief said there is normal hut the widow of Lamar Hunt who founded the American Football League and actually coined the term Super Bowl looking on there's some fart running the team always a very very classy organization annexed ramen company in Super Bowl for over the Vikings so Andrew a lot didn't even know he was gonna play this year after the shoulder surgery 59 completions beyond the first nine sticks that's the most red zone 32 secondmost topped only by mahomes who had 35 12 TD passes in the fourth quarter might lead him couple today secondmost in the link to Matt Ryan the Chiefs defense hasn't been very good this year but they have been pretty good at home and obviously this crowd is the major asset for that he had given up about half as many points per game as they did on the road that defense right now looking very very short as Derrick Maddy the DOS tackler working in a Florida State picked in the third round takes now tomorrow move back for loss of six wow we're seeing Derek naughty they're trying to get glue in ski to get a reach over here too naughty and not he's having none of it blew right past that reach block and made another play this has been absolutely the best I've seen the Kansas City Chiefs defense playing a game this year votes about template Hylton finally gets into the engine up to the 30yard line he's had a tremendous year gotta give a lot of credit he's paddle through injuries that ankle bothering has to practice much of late but he had five matches five yards last week against Houston showed up in a clown vest that got everybody loose tremendous season fourtime Pro Bowler don't forget it let's come back in 2013 it was tee white Hilton with over 200 yards receiving they have to get him going third and six Indianapolis looking for its first first now and what floors and that's port they still won't get it as Ebron that's taken down the minute he catches it he's swarmed over by the Kansas City defense and it's gonna be fourth down and one really surprise he bronzed put that thing up that quickly wasn't any kind of a hot read we have to get down to the sticks on that fiery kill is back for the Berto Sanchez already pumping in my drive to go back we'll ever run back from the 16yard he gets around the corner look out but he doesn't that's a great open field tackle made at the 16 yard line by team Hairston early second quarter 17 about the context my gang all rise for Premier League warnings tomorrow 11:30 Eastern Tottenham against Manchester United BC eccentric nearly morning city of fountains I was cozy here in Kansas City city all dressed up so far so good for the home squatters of these seventeen take it down at the line of scrimmage so Patrick Mahoney was thinking about coming out of Texas Tech early si you can petition the NFL advisory board made up of GM's and scouts and personnel people they projected them as a thirdround pick which tells you one thing I'm not taking any stock picks from the NFL advisory board what about you yeah four out of the six guys told him likely to be in the third round he said I'll take my chances yep he winds up going number 10 in the first round second quarterback chosen it's to Bhishma the ground this time at sting to the 23yard line well here's a bit of the day so far for Patrick mahomes and this vision of his and ability to move and find people that he's not even looking at he just he's looking one way and sometimes he won't look when he throws and we've seen that earlier this season as well but when he rolls to his right obviously very exciting but out where he's had the most success this year is rolling to his left REE touchdowns no interceptions and it looks like his shoulder can come out of the socket you make some of the throws he's made he was knee looks fine after hippy tunnel a series of export and they blow the plate dead because that was unimpeded to the quarterback of course the Colts are gonna say they were drawn off and John Hussey will have the final word offsides on a pita to the quarterback fiveyard penalty results in a first down for his nap because it was third down and four they call Kermit the Frog and that voice is drawing the Colts off time after time look how intense he is with that voice inflection and this is just been a nightmarish start for the Colts on defense even when they get him the third down they're just gifting those kinds of plays and now they've got to start all over again they were feared who was offside that time the spy penalties on Indianapolis surely offense number 70 whew Veigar penalty first down Eric Fisher we go to Michelle Chris you were talking about mahomes making the nolook passes using all those delivery angles Travis Kelce said you can't ever get caught thinking about something else like where you're going to go after the catch or where other players are going to be on the field Kelsey told me concentration and focus are at a premium until the play is over becomes mahomes is going to get the ball to the receiver any way he can and we have seen that time and time again all season long call the presumptively began a group reason being that race as well and there's a flag that comes in from the secondary place after the 26 yard line and he'll loses his shoe I still wouldn't want to raise them holding offense number 72 10yard penalty first down bonus backtoback penalties on the guy who was the overall number one pick in the draft back in 2013 at a central Michigan that was the year after Andrew Luck was selected number one yeah and he was a bit of a tough go for him but Eric Fisher made the Pro Bowl this year and I think that'll take all the pressure off of him for some of that here he is coming out here trying to make this block too much bulb so its first 25 you know if this 1sided is this game who's been if they can hold them here force a punt and score one touchdown all of a sudden you start feeling a little bit better and some of those ghosts of Christmas past start coming back to haunt the people in this crowd oh yeah they know it all Oh pudding last year in the wildcard game when they let Tennessee 21 to 3 and lost the game 22 to 21 vegetables second 24 his next attacks and back up folks quarantine pink team setting up third down in a mile it was interesting talking to Frank Reich last night about this very situation he knew how explosive the Colts were as well I mean the Chiefs were as well and he said you know I'm not gonna go crazy I'm not gonna just drop back and throw the ball I know we have a strength running the football that has been their weakness trying to stop the run during the course of this season so I'm not going to panic if something like that were to happen 13:20 for Kelsey so they hold them gathers covering on the play and with six minutes to go in the half and support down well we are seeing some stunts out of this Colts defensive line watch all this stuff coming here and it actually has worked a little bit that's how they've been getting some of their pressure up at that time nowhere close and almost gave mahomes enough time to work that one down the field just miss it throw the stand Colquitt his first punt of the game blocked it recovered by pastor in the end zone and if there's anything that a doctor had ever ordered for that man scene that was it wow that is some mistake you'll see the sees just part here for not J good as he comes ripping straight up and nobody really puts a finger on him and for the chief special teams unit that is the rarest of all mistakes they typically are the best in the league and I'm gonna tarry for the point answer shack Pascoe recovered for the touchdown the point is good that's coal quits first blocked punts in five years they've told the special teams does you can tune in Sunday the 27th of January through Eastern to watch the NFL's best battle for AFC and NFC pride at the 2019 Pro Bowl presented by Verizon could be there unless he's at the Super Bowl Pro Bowl played the week before the big one in Atlanta this year 1717 zhis city is on top is the Colts get back into the game despite the fact that a single first step the first man that pickle pound through the back we go to the block sometimes it's a matter of timing you think your partner here is going to make the block Daryl William so charcandrick west ends up seeing that and then he comes off but they both come off at the same time and leave a free path for nage a good that was some recovery on the backside of that as well by Pascal and lock knows he's in a game again to start at 12:20 106 yards was over the middle wide open his calcium and he'll take the ball into Colts territory so they answer that for the big game over the middle gethers makes the stop that's a gain of 31 you can see what the motion does defensively to these guys right here watch all this as Tyreke Hill goes back and forth and they're just unsettled and lose track of where Kelsey was on the play and that has been the issue with them is how do you play the run and also play that play actual and tells you coming in from behind and he is lighting him up right now 34 546 yards that acidity Watkins he can make those onehanded catches and so I'm in practice the other day Sammy Watkins you wish you could have played with those gloves huh I could have play with those hands honestly that was amazing looked like this thing might end up being tipped for an interception and it's just we did see him do it in practice the other day and it was as good as that one maybe even better than that one so then you put Sammy Watkins with this group of receivers second Tyree kill live move the chains again to the 25yard line and the Kansas City Chiefs have piled up 14 first downs to none for the coach Holmes just doing such a great job of calmly reading these plays he's just gonna take a look right here all right you want to move on by running back no problem there's a slant there you go and he just seems so under control a little threequarter motion out there like he's playing in the backyard as hole opens up there about seven yards within Williams gathers second and three you know is it's this is the way they kill you though sometimes here you can apply fun you get a touchdown you're thinking we're back in the game let's go let's go make the stop and they go right back down the field on you again you know all the talk had been about all the losses in the playoffs and most people gave the same answer that was before Patrick bones hiko Audrey making to stop clock going down to more than three and Williams will come toppling off he definitely got clipped a little bit on the back of that ankle Pat mahomes we asked the city quarterback he wants to be Patrick he said my dad is bad she made it clear to us little that's caught lunging and getting the first now his Travis Kelsey's been unstoppable the tackle that gives them another first down as the clock is under two and a half well there's almost no way to sit there on Travis Kelce when Tyree kill is flying by at about 90 miles an hour it gets your attention but it has been Kelsey underneath in these zones that has really just done the greatest part of the damage out here today and they let the clock roll down to two minutes so were the twominute warning at Arrowhead Stadium to city 17 like tariqa with you on the field coming up Tony Dungy Rodney Harrison will join me to the halftime we'll talk about the Kansas City defense being so good and what the Colts need to do to get the offense going like maybe make a first down all right a half time coming up from the field a little bit back up down Chris guys all right thank you Mike Mike looks like he's back at the Winter Olympics that cookie studio right that they're roughing it down yeah that is amazing isn't it though first down incredible the last time check the last time that happens in a playoff team it was actually Kansas City had done at Indianapolis back in a wild card game in oh seven this is a Colts team that's won ten of their last 11 games been averaging 28 points a game and just 16 allowed on the defensive side during that stretch and now it is just not working so there were some snowballs I think they were coming on to the field and Andy Reid going over to admonish some of the folks of course there was a ton of snow over the last 24 hours and they tried to get as much of it out of the stands as they could all that happened one time in Cincinnati and they handed Sam Wyche the microphone I remember a little speech through the crowd was that the one he says we're not Cleveland isn't that what he said yeah yeah although you can admit it now that was yeah that was Sam who says you know don't begin here dying we're cracking up all right everything is in order now the ball is at the 15yard line as the homes to stop on the your shop I have it first now but it will be second down and one and the culture going to take it's almost like now if you're Frank right you just have to have a break I mean what's happened so far in this game is that they just haven't had that big moment that big play on defense this is a team that's been pretty good down here in the red zone they do give up some yards between the 20s but generally they've been able to make a stand down here I don't think they know what to defend right now you know on defense if you can run the ball the way they've been running it you hit the screen pass you're hitting the ball to your tight end and you're making someplace they haven't hit one over the top of this defense yet but they've hit a whole bunch of them underneath those savings well that's the Kansas City offense scored 26 or more points in every game this season that's never happened in the NFL the shovel pass here Oh Sammy Watkins can they get a first and goal it again the Cossack only a time and we go to Michelle well Andy Reid was not happy with his fans and he told them so there were some snow balls being thrown out of the stands here on the near side left end of the field and he saw that NFL security was talking to the officials he went down there and indicated to the fans be smart use your heads NFL officials have said they're not going to make an announcement about this first infraction if you will they're gonna let in stadium security handle it but if there's another you know apparently there's these boy who said if there's another incident they are going to make them MouseMan on the field that a penalty could be incurred there was video evidence right of one perpetrator rise on the sidelines that really hurt though any word George Odom runs him out of bounds so it's second down and goal and the Colts take another time you know it's so interesting about this Chiefs offense they've had 18 quarters now this season with two touchdowns to put that in some perspective there are 26 teams that have only had 10 or fewer so this is an offense that is really doing something pretty magical going over that 20 feet and calling his 42nd play trying to get in believe he did is the official pulls back into the snowbank we're gonna wait for the call here who thinks it's a touch that made it is so all kinds of action going on over there but the Holmes is able to get to the pylon check it out again he gets in doesn't he looks like a touchdown for me no question about it and it was so much fun talking to Patrick about his dad playing in the playoffs in the World Series in baseball and having a chance to match that and how his dad fed off the pressure and the crowd getting after him and all that stuff and he just wanted from an early age the opportunity to do the same thing and he changing the conversation here in Kansas City well 274 yards of offense for these guys instead of a bunch of fireworks and stuff that's why you get all of the smoke stating as well as bunker bangs it through and the Kansas City Chiefs come back after the blocked punt the down the field ten play 75 yards enter up by 17 back at Arrowhead Stadium Andrew Luck might feel like that at this point man oh man what a half it's good for the Kansas City Chiefs Colts got a touchdown on the block but the park event we've got more black moths in first yeah that's right so the culture would get the ball so they have none yard line so the statistics you look at these statistics you think the score would be about 75 to nothing 188 passing yards 212 274 221 17 first downs to none of course the time of possession tilted everything tilted toward Kansas City you have to go here this is this has to be a dr t Whitehill eric kieron those guys have to get something going what is six with 15 yards they start with the rookie hi fires over the middle and completes that one and that's their first first down as Eric Ebron makes the catch at the 46 yard line and they go no huddle after a gain of 21 to the outside he goes and that's a manís bulb in long sidelined by Cointreau Inman is really good a nice job of midseason Steven Nelson rustles into the ground another first down I think they need to stand no huddle but this Dontrelle Inman I'd say what he ran a couple of routes last week one for a touchdown study Chargers under a minute with protection I just want to shout out here trying to get out of bounds and does this off the clock with 38 seconds where that was really impressive that effort to get that pole out of bounds it was a good seven or eight yards inside the number when he caught that they knew exactly what he was trying to do it got it accomplished they two or three bits to get out of bounds they the four second and six especially with this split safety look they have and split them down the middle and see if you're big Titanic can just go up make a play caught trying to get out of bounces Chester Rodgers does not forward progress stops him to the clock keeps on rolling but that will be a first down spot the ball the 27 yard 24:23 it pickin down they didn't have many timeouts to the sideline again that's quarter this time it's in and getting out of bounds so a great looking drive after they have done nothing throughout the half the ball is at the 14 yard line with 15 seconds I'm always amazed at how that no huddle offense sometimes can wake up a football team there's a man on the outside he gives a little shimmy no just out there but for Andrew Luck it's almost like there's an adrenaline flow happening with this Drive you have to take a few shots and urine has been the target down here he has great releases lined up just to the left of lock now whole offenses adrenaline first now step it away from trouble sleeping the sideline he will get out of bounds and that stops the clock with eight seconds so now what are you down you'd have to probably one more play and if you don't pick it up get the touchdown you go for the field goal maybe a lot of attention in there on Iran this time they were going to maybe after the some of the caches we've seen him and made give him a shot yes some lockedin hands second and 1/2 more importantly 8 seconds carts can I take a sack and he looks for passes in completely three seconds and the conscious six five and two sixty seven they put the big tight end in there and that with three seconds to bring out Bennett Aryan company took the shot at the former basketball player on the outside from BC you really never able to get up and even try and make a play on that one but not all bad the one thing you had to do is come out of this drive with some point so at least down two touchdowns this offense has plenty of firepower maybe in the nohuddle in the second half the amount of comeback the age of 46 of all things Wow down the field that go trying to cut it to a twopossession lead and folks we have seen this before like six days ago that wasn't a point that was a dawn ooh twentyfour seven at the half Mike Tirico telling you what's coming up on the Michael all right now thank you stunned coaches walking past us they couldn't believe they didn't get that a to score game we'll ask Rodney and Tony about why the Chiefs defense was so good in the first half and one of the adjustments of this Indianapolis team heading up the tunnel down 17 22 halftime coming up Casey after this one to stay uptodate hey Siri show me football scores tonight's first half highlights are brought to you by Chevrolet looking for space cuts it back so to speak around the corner he goes running towards the goal line line that is blocked and that is exactly what the coach needed should be the surge in deep our deformability awards for cars trucks and suv's downtown Kansas City the Missouri River bordering Nature City Missouri and Kansas City Kansas in fact we've come to Arrowhead 24/7 is the score there are the Holmes's numbers 195 most of the first Panther a postseason debut since 2003 for Andrew Luck the guy started on that last drive apart from that nothing went on first four drives the Colts head no first downs last drive the poor first half 70 yards but finitary missed the chip shot field goal Kelsey and Hill what they have done combining for 11 catches and we are ready to start the second half Al Michaels with Chris Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya and our whole Sunday night gang on this late Saturday afternoon just past sunset in KCMO Kansas City we'll get the ball frame on Smith back to return it done a nice job this year rookie out of Central Arkansas Rigoberto Sanchez to take off third quarter is underway Smith who is very fast at a 97 yard run back at Windham this year but not this time that is more making the tackle cooling war and we go to the shell I just spoke with Frank Reich and he told me we gave the Chiefs too much in that first half he was referring to five penalties that gave up so much yardage but he did say the no huddle they ran late in the half gave his offense confidence they had tried to get you earlier but couldn't get a first down look for more of that here in the second half out all right Thank You Michelle was Andy read last year his team was up 21 to 3 at halftime to kind of see one but losing the game got a hold on the night when their first playoff game quarter of a century at home as Watkins makes the catch we came in talking about the big three and the big three have delivered in a big way it all started early in this one with Tyree kill on the reverse Kelsey out front with a big block but that was just too easy to set the tone early and then it was Kelsey taking over a couple of short passes underneath been working the seams and then the star of the first half I think no question about it patrick mahomes showed everybody why he is that can be a second down in issues pick up the first man here to the 29yard line she's not married the ball ten times for 48 yards and now I want to make a point about it my home's here this is a young man we always show the highlight plays right scrambling around the nolook passes all that stuff he's winning from the pocket tonight he's 15 for 20 to 171 yards he was the best all season from a clean pocket and once again he's delivering in the pocket to a four now four balls 1928 a target detection the banfield in the traffic an incomplete intended for Hill he has a few words with JJ Wilcox covering on the plate in a second that's so funny Chris you mentioned you know what he's done into the pocket everybody's always saying well you got to keep in the pocket well they keep it in the pocket anything you say you take away the deep pass well they're the best at those short underneath passes they're the best at the screen passes so and he's pretty good when he takes off and run and the other part of this tonight how is he is just standing back there the pass rush has really not been enough of a factor to impact this just putting it on second ten inside here and he will pick up the first now be where he winds up in the middle of the chief bench run out of bounds by Kenny Moore alright so we showed you some of the RPO passes this time what happens alright let's just go ahead and sit on the backside of this thing so we're just gonna sit on the backside and just never able to get there on the front side of the run in that traffic jam there for Damien moves their workhorse back ever since but Corrine hunt go after the video surfaced thought that the Chiefs running game might pay a big price but it has not been the case audrey has been battling a shoulder injury throughout the course of the last few weeks and is pounding away and they're trying to get something going wrong this defense but boss and that one is caught there by Derrick dieter his first catch working at an Alabama a free agent so they put another guy into the mix front 11yard gain in the first down that's all I need right but more receiving threat on the outside but it has been interesting to watch and listen the Patrick mahomes at the line of scrimmage he is clearly dictating this game based on what the Colts are doing on the defensive side he's getting in and out of ways obviously that was a question for a young player could he do all that Alex what did you read that's the ball here attempted handoff but my Holmes is able to recover it there'll be a loss back there or the code eight yards that elbows drop down right on top of the ball but now for the Colts here's your shot right you live for a mistake it's the reason you play the zone defense is because you know you've got a second and 15 now you have an opportunity to get the Chiefs of the fields they have to make take advantage of this check again 17 the pressure steps the length of it signs it and Kelsey that picks up 16 to the necessary 17 to make a third down into one there he goes again Wow come on watch Kelsey he's going to come in here and then see his quarterback react and then he reacts over the top these guys have been doing this all season long but again the lack of pressure is just killing them what's this little threequarter that's hard enough to do with a pingpong ball much less of football do you think this guy is it darts hit the first dammit extra done it who shall come running in from the side I think that's what they're discussing there John Huss he's going to Shane good to see whether it's going to be a first now or a 4th down and inches which impurity we would go for Frank Reich got that job he would call in josh mcdaniels bill vanaman left him at the altar what a job he's done they're gonna be that much short and it's for that and of course considering two for two on fourth why not bringing an extra lineman in Boston Rita comes in so many different ways to pull this one off they pulled it up a couple of times running the ball to do his piece that was just hopes he's called the right defense here his they've been Williams with that forward progress looks as if he's picked up the first time that he has right there but couldn't stop him short of the line to gain then it's a first down for Kansas City Leonard dead Irving pulling around the backside and he goes right in the backdoor this thing it should have made this to Williams that was a fantastic ride and when her to the guy who led the league in tackles it's the tackle there can't save the first out the motion pressure that's incomplete the athenian williams second and ten marcus on body had a sack on that one and yet it is just this sort of little shoulder shimmy get around him and get the football out and then both feet in the air as he throws i'm so impressed with what i'm hearing at the line of scrimmage that time they messed the play up the guy in motion should have been emotion so he stopped him he said now you come so he is even when they're making mistakes he's figuring out how to solve that's inconvenient for Watkins when Andy Reid was talking about the back of trade Alex missed last year was little Egan passer rating and he said but we had to wait a couple of weeks to see if we had to back up the office in other words come back a little bit he said whenever he just kept moving forward well he did get in at the end of his rookie year in the game against Denver I believe it was and they saw how much he was able to consume that week and so then going into the OTAs they weren't sure but it didn't take long for him figure out they jumped again so you've got a free play here and Mahone wants to take advantage over by throne and has to be picked off at the goal line but it's not going to count by pierre de sheer because you've got it offside and all likelihood against ending again that's your boss seared again well it's a great play by my Holmes to take a shot but this is utterly ridiculous it's one thing when you get caught one time in the first half it's another thing when you're losing the football game because you can't stay on side yeah this has been pretty bad well that was actually Marcus punt looked like he was the first guy off so it's third down and five the home sliding to his left to Pete and incomplete survey attempt a field goal here would be about 51 yards is the slight wind and I win the negligible and the offense for the moment is going to stay out on the field that's truly the light of the Arrowhead crowd really don't have much to lose at this point he probably has more fear leaving him back on their own 40 with the field position request is in the backfield you're too going to get sacked so they will get the ball at about the 40 yard as it turns out the Niko Autry with the sack so that indeed defense stiffens and they get the ball be go flag that a flag is down at the 48 yard line coming out late it's a post possession foul something happened after the play so the Colts are going to keep the ball John Hussey tells us the rest after the play was over unsportsmanlike conduct number 96 it is Indianapolis ball first and ten wickets the sack and the flag remaining in the third kansas city 24 Indianapolis seven and there is the penalty on Autry and this divisional playoff game from Kansas City is being brought to you by Progressive Insurance panting all big savings to you by Sprint switch today and buy pizza pizza sponsor of the NFL bitch stay snow early on his temperature is 31 degrees Casey had the ball for the first six and a half minutes stop down after the penalty now Indianapolis gets it back of the 23 yard line a strike this Drive stars to the fast going in the ground to make the 10 series Chester Rogers we go to Michelle again Michelle well at the end of the first half we saw the Colts put together their best drive after not having to first down to that point and Andy Reid sought to wants his defense to do a better job challenging in the second area all right Michelle second down and six as they go no huddle to start this Drive this is part first down doctrine Pete gets it out to the 37 yard line Berkeley action there and the other way so this pace has definitely helped step it up step it away looking throws a little door here that's bobbled and incomplete Eric Ebron could not hold on luck those to the turf it'll be second down and ten and luck right now is 9 of 15 for 89 yards with the bulk of that coming on that one drive at the end of the half for Andrew Luck you just wonder now if he needs to get more into the game take off and run with the don't be afraid do something to wake up this offense personally this is his football team over the middle and the traffic an incomplete that one intended for Chester Rogers halfway through the quarter now it'll be third down at 10 T why hope today just tailed a one cats it's a big part of it offense one cache for ten yards with limping off at the end of the first half battled through all kinds of injuries this year primarily wild card game last week 85 yikes average one two one seven games but today held in check 30:10 blitz coming and the pass is low but as Rogers making the cap relevant in complain Daniel Sorensen comes in there too why the finish and its fourth down just like that well you never know what's going to happen on to play and yes there was pressure good call once again by Bob Sutton to bring that blitz but for Andrew Luck he's got to get that ball to the receiver he had space out there maybe he picks up the first down rotting sanchez madness is his fifth body's averaged 48 yards rookie the joystick tyree kill back at the wobbly the caching loses the ball but alertly right there to recover his frame on Smith so he'll along the sideline to make the catch crystal and the Chiefs retain possession twenty four to seven is the score mahomes his first 1716 this year one last year fiftythree have 81 yards by far the most marc bullard next way back 50 TD passes Kurt Warner had 41 in his first 17 and Warner had a second highest passer rating so that's what the Holmes has done he got to start the last game last year twenty three years old the hearings name for a while the past that is taken Hill Way first down out to the 32 yard line low throw hill going to the ground makes the great gain of 12 it's amazing how accurate he is with these threequarter deliveries watch this he's got a rusher in his face so he just kind of drops it down and keeps it low avoids any sort of turnover worthy to play puts it right on the money it's one thing to make throws like that it's another thing to have the kind of it's Leonard coming in to smother Williams once again we go to Rochelle you just detailed all those impressive stats mahomes has put up this season but he told us he also put up great stats at Texas Tech and he didn't win anything so instead of personal goals mahomes came into this season with two team goals win the division and then the Super Bowl and now the Chiefs are what about a quarter and a half away from taking the next step and taking the American Conference championship team right here his kids college coach was Kliff Kingsbury a Texas Tech who just got the Arizona Cardinals head coaching position this week as the pass is caught by Sammy Watkins on the outside taken out by Wilson 520 remaining in the third the pace has been going so fast we have to go back to show you a few of the replays this what happened in the prior Drive but watch this throw as he drops down to get around the defenders there's Kelsey on your left and look he throws it it looks like it's ten yards in front of them but perfectly time perfectly thrown sidearm delivery and Kelsey makes the play those are tough to defend but a baseball picture was a picture he was mahomes was drafted whose house he first there's is that and his son was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th ramp coming out of high school they took a shot and I just wanted to get his rights and I want to play football so far what does he think he is Russell Wilson what's coming for mass is caught but a good tackle is made there by kenny lord taking that Tyriq hill as soon as the ball got there and the indy defense able to stiffen again fourth down well now you're getting to that part in the game where you have to start taking some chances right they really have not been blitzing much at all but now take a shot there make them throw it hot and they're off the field the problem is not on that side of the ball the problem is on the offensive side of the ball bo quit his first punt was blocked it's this one over Chester Rogers quality little dangerous footballs it in at the 30yard line 3:45 left in the third ac up by 17 the night before Super Bowl 50 through the NFL's brightest stars come together to salute the best players plays and moments from the 2018 season NFL honors February 2nd my Eastern on CBS Eric Berry Comeback Player of the Year a couple of years ago this year foot injury and he played for the last few weeks but not ready to go tonight so that defense has been great that pass from work is caught by Dontrelle in heaven a nice night after the 50yard line tackle by terraria sward inna 19 and for enman I think he's just one of those veteran players came over sort of in the middle of the season that might well have to take over the number one don't think the Tiwi Hilton is right penis tonight for batteries or for fences for 55 yards now Matt and they really bottled him up tonight the hole in tirana game has been nonexistent gain of four hitchens former Dallas Cowboy makes the tackle and it's just stunning I remember how the Colts scored their touchdown on a block but so this Chiefs defense which has been one of the worst in the NFL this year is pitching a shutout to this point man she goes back Mack with his by far best carry of the night to the 32 yard line but there is a penalty holding Alpina throws it that's normally the call it's Braden Smith rookie out of Auburn number two pick it's tough to hold when the guys on the ground that's exactly what they called here he's going to pull out and go this way his second at 17 Jordan Wilkins is now the running back working out of Mississippi take it the hand luck steps up in the pocket throws caught 50yard line Hilton starts to lose his footing down he goes well you can tell he's he's he isn't right most of the season bacillus had a great year you know why but sometimes the great ones have a way of snapping out of it and just getting him while some of that attention back over to him that really hasn't been there throughout the course of the night third and six look out and luck is going to go down Justin Houston on his 30th birthday gets a second sack of the night here you go you're going to get both top pass rushers on one something which means Justin Houston's going to be inside against Lewinsky the guard and that would be a mismatch and it bounced into the end zone with a little overall one minute to play in the third quarter Kansas City hopefully to have another home game next Sunday up by 17 the NHL's best head to Silicon Valley for the 2020 Honda NHL allstar weekend first skills event Friday the 28th they saw threeonthree action Saturday the 26 at the home of the sharks in San Jose this drive begins there's no stripes I thought it came out prior to the need coming down this is close so Watkins has it Leonard is there spins him around pulls out and there is a clear recovery too right there so the Chiefs are trying to get to the line before the Colts can challenge but that ain't going to happen recovered by the defense first down don't even have to challenge they rule it correctly the first time so Reich doesn't even have to challenge and another gigantic break for the Colts ball is definitely out and great job there is the play by the young teen inside Darius Leonard that they've needed they needed a star to play like a star and now defensively they had that play and now you have to make something happen this is they're just enough of those feelings amongst the Kansas City Chiefs and what's happened to them in the past that you get that general unease in the stadium when anything goes wrong well five years ago resetting the clock to a minute five years ago the city of the twenty eight point lead and Indianapolis lost the game lock in that game take a look at what he did in the second half to get 314 yards the Tiwi Hilton had a monster day so they start from the 20 here walks Warren and Hilton cannot make the grab good coverage that time by Kendall's fuller on the plan will be second down in ten Buller out there has been doing a great job all year he's playing after thumb surgery as well you can see the big cast on his hand or helping in that way come up here don't go wide to the left they put him in the slot to the left put back in the slot to the right so they go 5 wide on a second down and 10 let's coming bolos out Kansas City hazard the extra maintenance time got the turnover just amusing comes away with the football so on a drive where you felt it was imperative for the Colts to get back in it and said Kansas City winds up with the takeaway well we were talking about the speed of D Ford in the run game early and now here it shows in the pass game he has absolutely had a career year this year as D Ford 13 sacks on the season and he puts the game back into the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs he had seven forced fumbles during the regular season motions the Colts Robert Mathis in 2013 now in the Hall was trying to make it pay off quickly for the pass that is caught and was billed that was he touched going to say that he was ruling on the field if the runner was down by contact first down lost a few lost the extra yardage and he's down after about 14 down was he touched yes he was good call here decir they're gonna gain 217 yards waning seconds of the third quarter looking at that clock a hill was just take us to the final 15 minutes of regulation after 324 to 7 sheets there's the benefit of ECB to music so we start the fourth quarter and II read 195 regular season wins only Marty Schottenheimer had more without a championship this is his 25th postseason game most in NFL history without a title but who knows now Michaels Cris Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya as we head down the stretch if the Chiefs win they are here next Sunday and proposed either the Patriots or the Chargers nd somehow pulls off a miracle finish here fully to the Foxboro or to Los Angeles there's the strive became vineyard gain maybe even for keeps those legs going does Damien Williams having a nice late 69 yards from him on 15 carries and a first down the interesting thing about it is Andy Reid is opting to go right after these two inside a gap tackles in there and they are creating space right where the strength of the defense is supposed to be this Damian Williams has really stepped up obviously replacing Karim hun and since that changeover happened they averaged 4.6 yards per carry with dream up 4.6 yard looking over toward the Colts Bank so it's gonna be against the Chiefs let's go your hands dancer the face offense number 75 there's a 10yard penalty first down left court Cameron Irving a little shot to the head so many times those hands slip up a little bit and that's what happened but I tell you with Cameron Irving back in there this has been rock solid you thought that the team that would be running the football in this case when he bit the poles and said it's been the Chiefs yeah it seemed it to be the plan Moriarty's here well Andy Reid 25th postseason game you know we've told many stories about Andy as affable as any man 20 years ago became the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles but it's it's always and we've talked about before it's the yeah but yeah I had a chance to announce the Super Bowl that he was in with the Philadelphia Eagles against the New England Patriots had an opportunity there but I don't think there's any question this is his best team so far especially if the defense keeps playing like this it's tackled by Leonard who seems to be all over the place thing with Andy you know 14 years and Philadelphia and kind of ran out of gas there people thought that he would take a year off maybe he needed it at that point a lot of things were going on in his life but no he said get right back into coaching in Kansas City jumped on it the next day yeah and he said that he had known the hunt family for quite some time and that when given the opportunity to come here maybe he wouldn't have gotten elsewhere but when given the opportunity to come here with this classy family that is Kenny Moore I say getting that slop let's pan off the air for be fourth down Travis Kelce saw it he just couldn't get his hands on Kenny Moore who has really become there's Kelsey right there looping right around ducked right underneath them and the Holmes never saw so once again this Bulls defense giving their offense another opportunity short one goes out of bounds so the cults keep saying the dire need of a drive one more time twelve eleven left of the board this AFC divisional playoff game is being brought to you by Toyota let's go places by How to Train Your Dragon the hidden world in theaters February 22nd but pets see the official soft drink of the NFL 50 years ago today we Joe in the middle right there we view Bank the winning coach Super Bowl 3 which really helped to turn the National Football League the National Football League the NFL team that game of the overtime game is 58 between the Giants and the Colts and there were two most significant games in the history of the NFL early first out here and they start with back up to the 21 I looked ahead I think we transposed a couple numbers just in Houston is not 30 today day yeah you know I thought it was the 12th it's the 21st shift to make it he's got something to look forward yes he does get a lot of presents doesn't he we brought that up second down and seven the pressures gonna run with the ball and slide to a stop every picks up the first down at the 29 yard line now just to put this in perspective a little bit the Kansas City Chiefs defense has given up an NFL record 26 first downs per game this year that was the Colts 7 unbelievable they didn't have any until the last two minutes of the first half various worth covering tea wide open during the regular season Chiefs allowed 132 yards on the ground 273 passing 405 total and today look at those numbers that made the bottom of the league in every defensive category during the regular season the boy would a job they've done tonight Bob Sutton's been great and don't forget in this building they've been a much better defense as well crowd noise certainly helps a lot of flags this time it's going to be both sir a lot of defensive offsides against nd now you got a full start here on Ebron second and 15 Franek correct looking like Manuka good Norton everything had been coming up roses for him as a play color during that 10 wins streak today waring on his second and 15 and that's dipped and batted and falls to the turf incomplete third and 15 Chris Jones that a big middle Chris Jones has to be one of the most entertaining guys that we've had a chance to interview this year gets his hand on yet another one here milkshakes in town as his favorite chicken joint but you lost a lot of weight during the offseason don't ask me how third and 15 is incomplete Hylton couldn't hold on to it Nelson almost came away with the Carroll and again they do partial blown the potential interception is fourth down that would have been the old pick six right there I do believe he's gonna run to krauser and walk saw it in behind and pretty much that's been the story all night and there you go you drop one and practice you do the pushups I think I've ever seen 34 yard line Hillsman retreat about 15 yards turn around the corner and that's gonna be about 60 yardage that he ran the gain about three Kansas City has the ball play Johnson's tight games continues to astonish with ordinary people taking on incredible challenges you can see the Titan team's new episode of this Thursday right here on the National Broadcasting Company Kansas City serving us Saturday night divisional weekend getting underway for luck 24/7 thirtyeight he goes let's take a look at our next gym stats powered by our friends at AWS and this has been the story tonight for Patrick mahomes he holds the ball 2.6 seconds no longer in okay 2.5 seconds or less that is pretty solid 20 or 24 most of his damage coming from inside the pocket 254 yards inside the pocket 24 outside and yet it is the outside plays that make the highlight reels therefore he was the workhorse tonight carried 18 times now for 78 yards for the Chiefs that big three mahomes 217 yards through the air and a rushing TD Hill eight catches 72 yards Kelsey seven catches he's caught at least five in every game except the opener this year compared to the other big three a whole different story really nice night both the coverage coming in gets the sack here on the slot blitz again and that makes it fourth down anymore just went right through charcandrick west we saw him do it last week the exact same thing watch him just come flying off here West is going to step over and we're just goes right through them for the sack their taxes going for he four arches fast abusive acrobatics the ball it is eight and a half to go a 17point kaseylee tonight's aerial coverage this to look at downtown Kansas City being brought to you by Geico tingling hands left in the fourth Kansas City trying to go wire the water tonight Andrew Luck it is he gets rid of the ball the ball is out and it's ruled an incomplete pass arm coming forward incomplete second down and ten you know any time you're going up against a speed rusher like Dee Ford the one thing that can sometimes get you is exactly that when he drops into that full rusher so used to have coming around the corner and he comes right down Broadway that was pretty close there too second to ten waring all night as they always do in our head it goes back pick game before he is forced out of bounds by Jordan Lucas even 21 their format well yeah I think you have to do a little bit of that right now because they've got their safety Daniel Sorensen in there just playing linebacker and the heck with this right right there and so now you get a big offensive lineman on a safety and you get a chance for a big place so there's they can put something together Ryan Kelly the center is shaken up here to miss the last game of the season when they clinched a playoff spot at Tennessee he's had a rough go of it back MCL he's missed for the last seven games trying to suck it up and play and have been Bane will come in I'm sure so Kansas City if they can win this game and obviously right now they're in the catbird seat they would host the AFC championship game for the first time in the 47 year history of this Stadium let's take a look at the brackets right now the charges in New England tomorrow Jim Nantz and Tony Romo will have that for you as we look at what's ahead the Chiefs hold on down this in the Rams later Joe Android loosening up their larynxes filly in New Orleans tomorrow Kevin Burkhardt Charles Davis who scheduled over the rest of the weekend here is Marlon lat and close to you picking up the first down behind the rock by vein we just came into the game here is old number 67 pretty tough to be asked to pull on your first play in the game you've been sitting over there probably stiff as a board comes in pulls around it makes a nice block so they get a little momentum going but you're not going to see the Chiefs come out of this is Bob Sutton like to say to take a few body blows at the forced to toss it up for Wilkins and incompleted will be second down to ten luck miss a couple here and there's Kelly over on the sidelines he is the brains of the operation everybody points to him how important he is being in there when he's not which comes in the backfield give it to off to the races here as he takes it to the 41 yard line finds rookie at North Carolina State picked in the fourth round and this is what they're able to do and they get those double double teams going and and you read sort of anxiously doing the math in his head as he looks at the clock a field goal now beep down the sideline and busted up at the end and then it's deflected and it is not grant inbounds that's Eric Murray coming away with it pass attempt before he Braun he wants a flag doesn't see one and it's second down to ten yeah Hebron really had a chance on this one when you get a defender running behind you you give up the chance to catch the ball just run right back through them it's an automatic pass interference possibly should have been called anyway it should have been should have been interference oh yeah Gordon Lukas's the guy who got away with it never turned his head second and ten twentyone takes care of the other Murray with the tango third down and long that durably ticking down six and a that durably ticking down six and a half to play in the fourth and the Colts have to go they have to pick this up we're back in the huddle now they've had to pick it up they've got a lot of work to do and Kansas City's offense is it going their van conversions Colts 49% that was the best in the league during the regular season tonight 0 for 7 make it 0 for 8 Chris Jones deflected it again fourth down you know it's just such a powerful thing and it's such a frustrating thing for a quarterback to have somebody just keep knocking the ball down and the Chris Jones he's been closed all night it just keeps making that play and now we probably have the ball game right here for the nine thoughts on life support in by Chester Rogers so a big dinner break forth them move the sticks scrimmages 229 just those own defenses and really this Chiefs team now has been playing a little bit I don't want to call it prevent but prevent ish for the touchdown so Hilton down the sideline he goes coverage with Steven Nelson right there and that stuns the crowd one of the key things is a receiver when you're going down the field like this is you want to hold off sticking out your hands as long as you possibly can and you can tell because it was Nelson he wants to react to what he's doing now he's got his head around just literally never saw the football so twhite Hilton who's been pretty much a nonfactor quiets the crowd for the moment that's a Willie Mays basket catch football style Venna Terry now for the extra point they're just confirming that on Park Avenue highrent district he makes this and he had made the field goal at the end of the half it could have been a 1 school if this is the first scoring of the second half then a Terry misses that one man oh man maybe it's us Venna Terry in his career in postseason had been 7470 on extra points his first this year a little slight bobble but he gets the ball down he missed it left the last time overcompensates and man every time you think there's something you can count on in the NFL not so much I have to wonder do they go on side here Miwa field goal that he missed earlier the 23 yarder is the shortest field goal he has ever missed in a 20year career so an 11point lead Kansas City lining up expecting the onside kick eight guys up at the 45yard line kick has to travel and they're all yards are all packed right in the middle may just be a fiddle trouble Gibbler will be fielded at the 16yard much good rod back after the 46 minutes Harry 56 field goals the most in the history of the league in the postseason for a career 37 37 points is the most this is number 32 Foreman pussies moment Tom Brady who will play in number 38 tomorrow go back to the shortest field goal he's ever missed off the uprights the city will start to use the clock as they can as Williams bitch respect if you eat of about four now that was an interesting strategy on that kick off they took a shot at hitting Sorenson on the Chiefs they tried to drill it right at him and he basically played dodgeball around it to avoid contact and allow that ball to go on down the field and it's a strategy you could see war well that's what they did they packed everybody in to get more bodies in there to try and have a little surface area today second and six churning to the 45yard line mr. Damien Williams tonight 20 carries from 95 yards let's go back to the kick for just a minute there's Sorenson right there and you'll see take a look Sanchez gonna try and drill him and he just played dodge ball barely missed him or else that could have been a onside recovery spun all the way down to Tremont Smith who had a good run back so the ball 245 will be under 40 minutes at the next those will be second down how bizarre would it be to have a knuckleball coming at you and a playoff game like that and your only job is that get out of the way of it well that is the clock stop it's here Colts take the time out there first 3:51 dy you got some upcoming games Fox Dallas and the Rams tomorrow the early game Foxborough is the Chargers and New England you'll see that one on CBS tonight's game is on Fox and the late game tomorrow also on Fox number six Philadelphia against New Orleans championship weekend to a TurboTax Odyssey championship starts first 3:05 like some beast of time AFC Championship which might be played right here at 6:40 eastern time that Sonic I'm sure very best to our brethren down the line talked about the guys call to the Tony good luck in a Super Bowl in Atlanta Williams is thirty nine Williams now with a hundred two yards on the night and the Colts just taken another timeout prior to it will be a third down and three well there's the guys that you have the beat on defense in the Kansas City Chiefs for Jones for the most part it was batting passes down Justin Hewson with that inside stunt beat Lewinsky for the big sack to stop that momentum shift but maybe the star tonight really has been T Ford early with the way he stopped the run that strip sack late and eventually they're gonna get you Darrell Williams that one game third down and three pulse it down on their final timeout little tepee good not connected bill covered there by Kenny Moore who has just been all over the place that I wore with a solo tackles three assists and a couple of sacks tonight there are some people that can hit the Jets this slot go route has spent so deadly all year for these guys but you could see he'll just hit another gear when he saw the ball and just barely missed that one you do have a flag there were no quick running into the kicker defense silver 52 J good wanted a second block and was a little overeager he's the guy that blocked it in the first half here he comes gets him with his leg where does he is barely some of the way down well his foot gets them right there so it was fourth down and three it is now first down they're down to their last time out in the twominute warning and explanation point balance at the nine yard man oh man a guy who backed up Jaya Jaya in Miami and a chance to start last year or at the end of the year he got hurt winds up signing with Kansas City looks like he did the third or fourth back it's 24 yeah his mom basically tried to talk Williams going to Oklahoma he said are you crazy they've got too many great backs down there you're out of junior college you only have a couple years left to go there's no way you're gonna beat those guys out he did just like he's got his whole life and now stepping in for creme hunt he's been quite a test yes so he was debt sure take it to the fiveyard line you come here you got three money as Spencer where got tricked and request and he winds up signing with Kansas City fights for a job and theory is tonight gaining 130 yards on 24 carries and they liked him so much and what he's been doing gave him a twoyear contract worth eight million but it really was and you could tell that Andy read the one thing that he knew was that he had some heat in the backfield he told us he said I had confidence I knew I had guys that could fill in that position I don't think that even Damon did Williams he looks like he's shot at this point what if we even imagine that here he is now he's heading for the AFC championship game with a chance to go to the Super Bowl one at 75 rush yards Kansas City and wouldbe tackler there that's illegal Autry have the Colts out of timeouts now I've got to tell you the other thing that I've really found interesting is how improved was finitary it's been a rough night for him how improved the bold moves that the Chiefs made in their secondary have been they pride in Chavarria sward the rookie to go out and play cornerback they've been Sean Parker and Orlando Scandrick brought in Ward brought in Jordan Lucas and this deepest just looks different and they may still get back Eric Paree for one of the next two if they get to right he does Darryl Williams for the touchdown a game ceiling drive and watch who it is that pushes him over the goal line mahomes gonna jump in there and give them a little push baby as it should be who was it that got the Kansas City Chiefs over the goal line and over to the curse of Christmas pass with some of these playoff losses Patrick mahomes and there he is that's beautiful but for the extra point it's one of the oldtime cliches he does it all little in the homes he does it all he does it all the best part about him is the new face of the National Football League and I think there's no question that he is that is a good face that is a fine young man every time we've had a chance to meet with him he's first class he's honest his teammates love him his coaches love them and about 70 something thousand in this stadium are extra love them so it's going to be either the Patriots or the Chargers coming in here next Sunday and each would be a rematch of a tremendous game because we had that Sunday night game in Foxborough earlier in the season when the Patriots came away with a 43 to 43 and then the Chargers came in here toward the end of the year and that tremendous comefrombehind win that culminated with a twopoint conversion to win the game got to be happy branded read right I mean here's the cat this been torture two playoff games everyone 32 that Patriots chief came week six eight 946 combined yards that night Brady threw for 340 mahomes 352 crazy game the best we've ever had in the Sunday night package pretty good Chargers Chiefs game boy as well came right down to the wire twopoint conversion determined that one but casein was able to thanks to Baltimore knocking off the Chargers cement that number one seed then he tripped up here to the 40yard line it's going to take us to the twominute warning that much time will be left before the Chiefs can begin the celebration is there on the championship game 31:13 Kansas City Volkswagen postgame report coming your way Michelle on the field stars of the game we could probably figure out a couple lien previewing the playoff bracket like Tony and Rodney all here breaking this one down Chris and I will wrap it all up second and one so that makes it 450 go quickly to the line ball at the 49 euros 3472 yards really good driver makes the catch teams inbound train launch Smith with the coverage that gets second down it's been a tough night tonight no question about it but you have to like how this cold Steam is position moving forward she just can't overcome the great team with a twoweek break she brought makes attacks goes to the sideline one level I mean so many stories tonight but that King is a city defense rising to the occasion in the boxA Bob Sutton right there and we say it again you almost have to say two different defenses right 35 points a game on the road they allow 18 points here with this offense you give up 18 points in the championship game Chester Rogers Reggie Rockland makes the tackle so for the Colts a oneinfive start red hot cents with cool draw tonight for Kansas City a 500 start they were 9 and 1 the cooled off a little down the stretch but win the night going away second and 7 attractive there's a flag down to reach the fountain first time that he's been targeted tonight flag is down on the far side of the 10yard line pass interference defense number 35 the baltic place to spawn the file automatic first down Sanjiv arias worn with 34 seconds we're painful than that you guys we get to play that much wide open so they spot the ball at the 11 yard line Evon couldn't come down with the former Detroit wine making a second down and ten now they've even got their backups really in the game now for the Kansas City Chiefs obviously bigger things ahead for them at this point they're starting to give some O's other guys an opportunity in the football game I'm sure they'd like to preserve what the first ring has done for this ball that one is incomplete snow angels for various Ward Zach Pascal who scored that touchdown on the blocked punt earlier third and 10 mister various Ward I'm telling you as a player every week I think he gets a little bit better a little bit better he has been all over it Steven Nelson on the other side is a quarterback that everybody says hi he gives up a lot pick plays he's been thrown at deep more than anybody in the National Football League and his percentage of plays given up one of the best toss that school gets it before it'll be fourth down clock keeps on rolling this Arrowhead Stadium gets ready to host its first ever see championship game get this play off before almost stings appropriately Cades a city all the way start to finish great opening drive great second Drive Frank right the ends his first year as a head coach with the defeat here regular season and we have the Volkswagens post even worth coming up next after these messages from your NBC station
