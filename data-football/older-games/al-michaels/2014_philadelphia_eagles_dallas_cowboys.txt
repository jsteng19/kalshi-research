============================================================

fireworks go off and we are set for what we think is going to be a heck of a game and it's the president on a near windless night with the ball being blown off the tee he'll figure they got a riku the fireworks talents there the whole thing I did the wind at the moment I'm just looking at the wind machine it's at three miles an hour a second to go so maybe that's the norm of who knows and once again after one false start Bayley sends it down for the potty and it's been about at the 17yard line the ball is loose the Cowboys are there at the 17 yard line Terry McCauley is the referee some miscommunication there because Huff was coming up to take it but the up back looked around expecting Huff to live ball it's a lie he's just like an onside kick it doesn't matter we're on the field that is the Cowboys ball if they're on it and they are I don't know if he just missed the kick but it was well short and none of the up backs even seemed to react to it Brad Smith was right there and he just puffed just couldn't get up to it in time it's on the ground and now it is just a freeforall down there and CJ Stillman comes up with it bran Smith is a guy who's run back a lot of kicks in his career we used to play with the Jets but he moved forward looking to block Huff came up from the goal line and couldn't handle it Stillman winds up with the football the Cowboys get a huge break right off the bat as they have a first down at the 18yard line clearly huh but that Brad Smith has gone up to catch the boy you could see Huff relaxed thinking that Smith was going to get it and now Tony Romo who probably has had that injection and his back about thirty minutes ago is out there ready to go ah dirty here is that the Eagles have one of the best special teams groups in the National Football League but a big mistake right off the bat so I have to Philadelphia okay 14:55 if philadelphia elects to receive it also means that dallas has a short field Dallas will get the second half kick go up so a nearperfect start right now for the Cowboys we'll see if they cash in Thanksgiving it was the Eagles who got off to the great start and now the Cowboys will an opportunity DeMarco Murray leads the league in rushing he is the running back play fake Romo what's downfield as coverage because it's way out of bounds as we take a look right now at the Dallas starters Tony Romo Eastern Illinois University DeMarco Murray Oklahoma Dez Bryant Oklahoma State Terrance Williams bailiff Jason Witten Tennessee James Hannah Oklahoma Tara Smith you'll see Ron Alou University minute Travis Frederick Wisconsin Zack Martin Notre Dame dug through Northern Illinois University pop on the sideline front of shake it off is the cowboy offense comes up second down and 10 play clock down to three and we give it to marine forced out of bounds after a pickup of five yards by Cedric Thornton Tony Romo owns an NFL record he's on the touchdown pass in 39 consecutive road games so you play 80year that means over the last five years he's thrown one and every game on the road this year 15 touchdowns one interception all their issues have been at home Cowboys NASA and three receivers to the left Romo out on a shotgun on a third and six from the 14 good protection pants pork that'll be a first down Terrence Williams takes it to the six yard line Carey Williams the cornerback makes the stop it will be first down and goal for Dallas just a little slant across the middle here and it has been Williams who has not been much of a factor had six touchdowns early in the year but really not doing much lately and right off the bat at least initially this offensive line with good protection he has seen less action cold Beasley has seen more its first and goal from the 6 Marie and Murray taking the Eagles with him all the way down to the oneyard line Murray on bass were close to a two thousand yard season he's almost a cinch right now to win the rushing title he's way out in front say a guy who's been playing really well lately is Doug free he had a broken foot missed a few games but now he and Jason Witten they're just moving the pile down towards the oneyard line trying to make an early statement with this offensive line second and goal watches the fullback Murray hazard after initial contact able to thrust Ward and get into the end zone for a Cowboys touchdown so the miss clay and you can see Hough saying my fault it's on me he gave up the ball in the Cowboys cache in going 18 yards exact Martin and they're taking care of Benny Logan and then the fullback klux able to just clean up after that but I tell you for the Dallas Cowboys the way they were embarrassed the hot start you could tell that Chip Kelly one to get his offense on the field and see if he could do it again in this game and instead the tables are completely turned now Bailey for the point after and 214 into the game takes the blame now boys go into the store and leads seven to nothing Sunday Night Football brought to you by Southwest Airlines look your low fare now at Southwest comm 5 Verizon get the bit more with our besties this holiday season by the allnew Kia Sedona and by Bud Light stand the game and drink responsibly earlier this week there is more hosted their annual holiday party for locals for dealing his family hardships took over as the quarterback when nick foles went down and early November now puffed back there again and again Bailey a bashing ball scooped up by huff and the garbage is good is it's taken out of bounds by Barry Church and let's take a look at the Philly offense Mark Sanchez Southern Cal with sharp Okoye Pitt Panthers Jeremy Maclin Mizzou Tigers Riley Cooper Florida Jordan Matthews Vanderbilt burn SELEX Cincinnati Jason Peters Arkansas Evan Mathis Alabama Jason Kelsey Cincinnati Andrew Gardner Georgia Tech Wayne Johnson Oklahoma so the Eagles of course go no huddle and fast pace and no running plays at a quicker pace and any team in history start from the 22 yard line bottled up as he reaches the line of scrimmage so put the clock in time to the next play they normally run a play in about 22 seconds second down and 10 is when they snap work but before they even snap it you've got a false start here all start offense number 71 fiveyard penalty second down jordan matthews moved they called that one on Jason Peters they're both moving forward Mark Sanchez now since he took over for the injured falls tenth Edie's 62% 88 and waiting as a victory over Dallas on Thanksgiving Day the 21 yard line that Bose was Shawn McCoy LeSean McCoy last year was the rushing champion so he won the title at DeMarco Murray figures to win this year the average did McCoy 5.1 yards per carry last year but only four point one this season a third down and 12 from the 20 and then that pass is incomplete intended for McCoy so about his raggedass start as you could possibly have box the kickoff let the Cowboys go in for a touchdown and then a very quick three announce well and that's the key because they're coming off a game against Seattle in which they had a hundred and thirty nine yards of total offense 82 yards passing both the lowest ever in the Chip Kelly era and now they turn around and start the game this way this time and now they are taking their punt returner out Chris Harris is going down because there was an empty slot over there with nobody guarding him so nobody's going to feel this putt and Donnie Jones will send it down he goes but bow shoes twentyone more yards down to the 12 yard line it's a 69 yard kick 7 nothing Dallas miss a moment of Sunday Night Football with NBC Sports live extra kicked the game with you anywhere online and on tablet downtown Philadelphia on this middecember Sunday night in temperature of 44 and for that 69 yard pot that bounced 21 yards for the 12 yard line Tony Romo under CEQA Murray over the right side gained three Barwon makes the tackle we go back to the punch see what happens right up here is Josh Huff and Dwayne Harris had to come down and cover him for fear that they would just take the ball and throw it right there so there's no punt return in the middle of the field and ultimately it costs the Cowboys probably 20 25 yards of field position not a bad play by Harris he was just didn't want to give up the free shot down the bow second and seven Hannah the tight end in lotion and all over the left side and just go written covered by Hamlin pressure put on by poll let's take a look at that Philadelphia's defense says if Jordan southern Marcus our universe beanie Logan Louisiana State University Fletcher cause Mississippi State counter Barwon Cincinnati Casey Matthews University of Oregon Michael Kendricks cap from Cole systematic Bradley pleasure Nate Allen University of South Florida knocking jinking the Ohio State University Terry Williams walk third and seven now from the 15yard line Romo over the middle to Whitney and went out to the 36 yard line they've been doing that for both of their careers 21yard gain their little double coverage out on Dez Bryant leaving Jason Witten wide open in the middle of the field they're working against Nate Allen here's a good matchup on the outside you've got Trent Kohler going against tyrant Smith but for Tony Romo to come out and get out of the hole created by the mistake on special teams it's a huge difference now for this offense and converted on a third and seven the ball now from the 36 yard line good protection again to the outside Tipton almost picked the pass intended for Dwayne Harris Terry Williams comes up to deflect it away second to ten ordinarily you'll see this guy carry Williams and a lot of man coverage but usually in bumpandrun this time he just read the route of Harris perfectly and that's awfully lucky for the Cowboys that wasn't a pick six you have better be careful out there with Kerry Williams very aggressive very physical now matched up against Dez Bryant who is equally physical Williams almost always lines up on the right side flexor lines up on the other side Brian can go either way this time it's Bryant against Williams at the bottom Murray finds a little bit of a hole gets to the 41 Jenkins makes the tackle so Murray of course has always been tremendously talented great college career at Oklahoma drafted in the third round and one of the reasons maybe he's playing better than ever will probably be the rushing champ is the fact that they've rebuilt that offensive line through the draft over the years and he's been able to take full advantage of that averaging over five yards per carry this season thirtyfive they send five and the pass is caught by Witten again over the middle so Philadelphia took Witten out of the game in Texas over Thanksgiving Day one catch for eight yards and tonight he's already caught two for 38 that's good for 17 in the first down check out tired Smith number 77 on the outside takes out two of the best pass rushers that Philadelphia has Conner bar went in at Trent Cole on the same play and for Jason Witten whose numbers have been down as a receiver last few weeks he's off to a hot start giggles oklets they run it to the left side again there goes Murray and he picks up nine he's taken down by Casey Matthews just short of a Dallas first downs one of the things the Eagles want to be able to do is with their interior three Fletcher Cox Vinny Logan and Cedric Thornton is sort of create walls in here they do not want anybody running in there and that is exactly what happened to the Cowboys last time this time a much more aggressive approach getting to the outside Tyrone Smith nice job blocking and the cut back lanes are created at that point now the backup back Lance Dunbar comes into the game on second and one and that's Dunbar with the ball and he'll be able to pick up the first down moving into the 30 so with Tony Romo we all know about these two small fractures and his backtoback surgeries over the past year and a half is tough as they come missed one game against Arizona then played in London had a bye week going into the Giants game on a Sunday night which they won but then only three days dressed before the Thanksgiving game he wasn't right the team wasn't right but now he comes in here Chris on 10 days rest yeah you could watch the tape of that game and just see the heat cook nail didn't take his usual shot to give him some mobility and it showed Dunbar stays in the game they fake on the indoor just dumps it at the feet and completed will be second down and ten one of the things that Romo wanted to try and get done in this game is yes they're going to be a first and second down run team they've been that all season long and that has been who they are but his feeling was you got to take some shots on early downs too that's when the passing lanes are the most open so let's not be so predictable let's make some plays down the field but so far those first down shots haven't been there he's been getting the gun on Thursday and in using Murray's ass a lot on first and second and he's had fewer third and shorts than any team in the league puts you in a position to have a third 233 and now more and he spins around and that's exactly what he will do here go set you up with a third and two in the Nate yard gain on second down one of the things that the Philadelphia Eagles like to do with their linebackers Casey Matthews and Michael Kendrick says have them be very patient behind that front three line and there you saw him sort of sitting back and waiting and then when they see Murray come through there then exploded go get them but you have to make the tackle so far they've been missing the open tackles in space the maria's 7yard gain spotted at the 23 another third down for Dallas the Cowboys are three of three on third down to this point q and that's Witten who will have the first down so he makes his third catch of the game needed three got for first now Cowboys it's a little bit interesting and that the Philadelphia Eagle has really thought that the Cowboys offense was changing a little bit they were asking Jason Witten to block so much that he was more of a safety valve in other words blocked and then escaped late and yet here early in this biggest game of the year it has been the Jason Witten show under six minutes to play in the opening quarter down the suntimes 7nothing Murray to the outside can you get around for he does for a gain of about four Cowboys made a change in the offseason Bill Callahan have been calling the plays a year before it had been Garrett they go to Scott Linehan former head coach of the Rams and then he went to Detroit where he was known as the passing display caller in the lead I asked if I said is it a little hard to call these runs he said it's a little unnatural I've got to admit that he said but this is what we do best we are built around this offensive line a DeMarco Murray so we're staying with it second and five Lori's already gained 39 yards on the ground tonight the outside little pine but easily makes the catch well he's really come on covered there by Jenkins and Cole Beasley will set up a first and goal from the seven yard line boy what a matchup this is right here Zack Martin the outstanding right guard draft choice Fletcher Cox who has been proven to be just a terror against the run and not bad as the pass rusher either a lot of people think Fletcher Cox has been the best defensive line going in Zack Martin the Dallas Cowboy he's got a right with that pen this will be the 14th play of a drive that started at the Dallas 12 we get stuff Fletcher on cue Chris here's the problem you've got is that Fletcher Cox is so thick he can go through you but he can also go around you here Zack Martin sets up and thinks he has him thinned out and then he just whips right around the Fletcher Cox only has three sacks but he has a lot of hurries and because of their style of play it's not a pass rushing style so statistic he's not going to have big numbers and his the Eagles put anybody plays against him they vote and the bunch of taxes will lost that one right there two second down and goal Cowboys five wide wrong all the time wait for somebody to get open nobody can get open secondary says it's work it'll be third down and goal tried to get it to des Bryan in the back of the end zone but when des step back he got pushed out of bounds so Tony Romo despite the fact that he had all this time to throw the back left in zone as Brian's out a pound and it's no longer an eligible receiver tried to peel back on Carrie Williams who shoved him out of bounds and no flag no foul and now we have a flame and well after the play the field jokes came in through a fast eliwood contact defense number 26 yeah that's right and Chip Kelly saying why you throw a flag five seconds after the play is over all right here we go right up here right before the pass he shoves him out of bounds obviously more than five yards down the field illegal contact properly called relatedly call but properly called and the crowd booing music took about five seconds for that flag to come out we were in the replay when the flag was thrown and it sets the Cowboys up with the first time to go at the 4 yard line they've had seven runs and seven passes this is play 15 of the drive Murray to bring them down in the three yard line second down and goal for Dallas you know it's it's going to be very tough to get movement from Benny Logan and Cedric Thornton and Fletcher Cox inside their job is to hit make contact extend their arms like a bench press and sit there and watch and see does he go to the right or left and then shed that time you saw Benny Logan do it perfectly game is 11 and a half minutes old and Alice's had the ball for 10 minutes second ago no running back got a pass that des brilliant will haul in for a touchdown over Bradley Fletcher so they go 88 yards 16 plays in 8 minutes and 16 seconds what's the arm extension here but no real push I think the official was looking closely his arms got extended but there was no real push that came out of it so they let that one go so a few close calls here that go to the Cowboys way butcher the guy who gets picked on most and a Philadelphia secondary Bailey for the extra point and the Dallas Cowboys have come roaring into Pennsylvania late the first quarter and lead 14 to nothing Jimmy Fallon in town in New York all week long with a good lineup of guesting Frankel the coming by you'll also see Ben Stiller against this week on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on NBC well Jerry Jones is right there Steven Jones his son his daughter Charlotte Frankham Dean Jones his wife sitting one well behind some different formation tonight for luck I guess and so far it's paid off they never made it yet right from the oneyard his branch Smith who runs it back and gets taken out nice tackle by Hanna before he reaches the 20yard line so the Eagles have the wolf only the second time and trail 14 others Rod Marinelli the defensive coordinator was on the staff last year Monte Kiffin was the DC that Mommy weaves upstairs and rods defense they created a three and I his team now has a 14 to nothing lead and let's see what the Eagles can generate now beginning from the 20yard line Sanchez hands the ball to McCoy and he gets swallowed up before he gets to the line of scrimmage all over him right there number 96 Hayden McClaine comes in as well boys been a big difference to that defense it'll be second down and 11 for this defense he's playing so much more discipline put ball tonight taken down at the point where that is Rolando McLean making the tackle from behind again they go at warp speed but they need a first end at defense their defense isn't on the field the whole game this is a huge play what we saw against Seattle for Philadelphia if they don't make first downs on the first three plays that they have they're in trouble Darren Sproles is in the game he's going to get sack of the 16 yard line though a nightmare start mcclain and Jeremy Mincey converge and that six plays in less than two minutes and they got a punt again little cross right here and go through and remember the Dallas Cowboys only have now 20 sacks on the year compared to the Eagles at 44 so a bit stunning there but they catch him with a blitz and they win bounty Jonas with a wobbly kick fielded before by Dwayne Harris and he gets tackled immediately as a flag down on the play you know how it was interesting and if you brought that up to Jason Garrett that his team doesn't blitz very much last night on third and medium there we were in the first real third and medium what they do they blitz and they come up with a sack yeah I mentioned to him last night you guys only blitz on third and medium we got penalty here against Philadelphia now I'm gonna see if Garrett wants to decline it I said you're only blitzing 7% of the time the league average is 40% he said I didn't realize it was that severe you're clear curtain oh my go I like it we're going about Valens on his own on a pot kicking team number 11 fiveyard penalty out of the end of the play first down timeout kind of leaves on half a minute they have to go in the quarter 14 to nothing Jason Garrett has watched his team be perfect on the road to season 6 on the 32.2 points a game only Indies scoring more per game on the road and look at Tony's numbers 15 touchdowns one interception on the road this season and DeMarco Murray has been great home or Road on 30 yards per game only Arian Foster of the Texans week more Road yardage so they start now Joseph Randle starts at running back from the 44 yard lines and he's a number three guy who seemed Dunbar Lisa Marie and he gets stopped at the 43 you know we see it so often Chrissie it's two teams meet and and people say 17 days ago Philly kill them so they're gonna kill them again but this is the NFL you never know what's gonna happen Cleveland Cincinnati the exact same thing Cleveland comes with Cincinnati knocks them off big Cincinnati returns the favor going back the other way so there is no such thing anybody tells you they know what's happening in NFL just laugh out by a nose anybody know anyone second down and 11 but it's fun to talk about it anyway it's 43 no running backs you go 5 wide here vanish spreading it out threeman rush makes the catch that's a first down takes it to the 44 yard line under a minute to play now in the quarter I'm really surprised to see the Eagles with this threeman rush just these three guys and we've already seen Romo just thin they're basically in the pocket and and I gotcha but this is the team that really has been build around man coverage they even have good nickelanddime guys Brandon Boykin very good six interceptions a year ago Nolan Carroll they have the ability to play man across the board so far though it hasn't been the case and you shouldn't fall into the moment on the sidelines ramble is in the backfield they flare him out well over the pump a comes back the other way throughout the past was incomplete intended to fly crowd wants an intentional grounding Paul who's Macaulay but he was ready to open up his mic dez bryant basically wheeled and was going up the field Romo threw it outside think it would have been intentional grounding when i first looked at it but his crowds getting a little restless and well they should don't take anything way Blanca to run a draw rainbow Joseph Randle to the 30yard line given a lot of talent drafted in the fifth round out of Oklahoma State that's a first down and that takes us to the end of the quarter totally dominated by the Dallas Cowboys 14 demethylases floor and Sunday night picked off the Philly back after this tonight's aerial coverage is being brought to you by Geico Philadelphia Al Michaels christanja to show the glory of Sunday Night Football we could feed 14nothing Dallas and the Cowboys on a first down here Murray that's his 11th Theriot the game to the 25 so how did things start tonight here's a look back look at Brad Smith on this one the up back prays they're pointing to Josh back at the end zone basically saying that fall is jurors and Josh Huff said are you kidding me that thing's 30 yards away it's not like the old days where I'm staying on the goal line I am ten yards back there and he knew he couldn't get there and he was anticipating Brad Smith look it was not a typo under 32 yards 20 flag is thrown here buried to the outside he gets taken down by the safety Malcolm Jenkins penalty is against Dallas second down that's what let's go to Michelle well Eagles linebacker Casey Matthews collided with teammate Nolan Carroll a few plays ago he went to the bench had a brief conversation with the medical staff on the sidelines and then eventually went to the locker room without his helmet he's being evaluated for a head injury out all right Thank You Michelle that's a manual option number 51 thirdyear guy out of Texas came over to trade with Cleveland and it's significant because D'Amico Ryan's was there there he got hurt so Casey Matthews came in boats were the signal callers now they're threedeep in that position here's Beasley and easily takes it to the 25 yard line that's five yards short of the first Boykin makes the tackle and sets them up for a third down and five and the Cowboys are four for four on third down tonight now Dez Bryant pretty good receiver but on these quick screens he's almost more valuable as a blocker because he's big and he's strong and then you can allow for Beasley to run the football behind him number one on the league on third down we mentioned before when you got a guy like Murray he sets you up in a lot of third and shorts right now they or whistle before the snap he's been acting up front Byron Smith the Cowboys fall for fiveyard penalty her down so two penalties on the series year and it's third down and ten now and it's significant because they're at that longrange field goal range here so we certainly don't want any part of the sack here you don't make sure you get this three part point opportunity out of it with five wide and he does it again play clock on the fire and this time they get to him at the 38yard what your toxins another flag that came in at the end of the play just after the play flag in the secondary down of the 23 yard line a huge pause defense it's the first down if not they're out of field goal range contact defense number 27 that's Carrie Williams that turns a fourth and 18 and out of field goal range into a first down carry Williams wants to be physical it's his nature he's very good at it unfortunately in this game thus far that's legal that's legal wouldn't she get down the field they're gonna say that's illegal and here's a guy that's fired up you're playing in a big game you want to get after people and the rules are not going to allow him to do it that's his second penalty first down at the 25yard line more conventional said Marie to the short side of the field runs out a loom at the line of scrimmage one inch is there that make a second out of ten well in the three games that Chip Kelly has had coached in this series two in one record against Romo only one touchdown has Tony thrown with four picks coming in and they limited Murray to a very pedestrian three point three yards for Carrie Davis the defensive coordinator but tonight 141 yards to nothing so far for the Dallas Cowboys who have owned the football and now before second down our 10 first timeout they have play clock rolling down Dallas will take a timeout three minutes into the second quarter now you've got Matthews coming back to the bench so a good sign is he obviously had to be cleared back there it's kind of a remarkable story isn't it about Tony Romo and what he has to do to get that back ready he goes out for pregame warmup and then goes back into the locker room and he gets an injection at that point in his back he said it takes about 30 minutes for it to kick in but can you imagine he was describing it and obviously if you've been through some of those procedures they put the needle in and then they sort of twist it around and they're different angles and Tony said the guy does like playbyplay on it he says right we're going here and we're gonna do the sets I don't need to know just expose it stop it is faster Ranieri he lost today at Buffalo we'll figure that one out Roma would be number two its second down and ten went deep and there's Bryant touchdown Dez Bryant it's free down the sideline for the touchdown when you're in bump and run coverage it all happens at the line of scrimmage you win or you lose at the line of scrimmage right there Bradley Fletcher does not get his hands on Dez Bryant then hesitates at the top end of that route protection was rocksolid their guy with a bad back you don't want to see him on his back and so far tonight this offensive lines been pretty good they go Fletcher's way again six more points make it seven Bailey for the extra point 26 yards second touchdown and the Dallas Cowboys are up by three touchdowns Sunday night football being brought to you by Microsoft Surface the official tablet of the NFL by Pepsi hype your hometown with Pepsi Pepsi calm my mercedesbenz experience to the greatest merit today at your authorized dealer by American sniper and select either December 25th everywhere On January the 16 series terminal parking Fury stole it off of the Reading Terminal Market teach me to read the card before I say anything Nick Foles who was the starting quarterback until he broke his collarbone in Houston on the sidelines and the wait to see when he's ready to come back watch is the first guy to hit him he's down on the run back at the moment out of bounds at the 26yard line during the return holding the city team number 23 10yard penalty first down so it falls out Mark Sanchez and you know about Mara number of years with the Jets elected fifth overall in 2009 here San Jose he was known there started the AFC championship games is a rookie and a secondyear guy he won four playoff games then he missed the entire 2013 trees in with a shoulder injury bring it to as the Eagles starting quarterback they let him go in March he signs here till they let Mike Vick go and he signed with the Jets and here Sanchez one career win and trailing by 14 or more who actually did that game and he walls to his left and throws and at least they get something zero net yards to this point as Selleck makes the catch and it's a gain of about five Sanchez played very well in the first Dallas game he had 24 29 217 102 rating everything was great in that one and he slings it to the left side that's juggled and no Riley Cooper did not have control of it sterling wore covering on the plane complete and will be third down and five in Philadelphia is on the cusp right now of a third consecutive three and out yeah and I know Chip Kelly doesn't care about time of possession but when it's 15 minutes the three minutes that's a bit of a problem and you keep going three and out it's a real problem Sanchez brings Selig into the backfield as protection he stays in the block is marvel at the time he throws and they finally get a first half as Scholz makes the catch this grows flares that the former charger and sink first year here Hitchens makes the stop first down if there's Darren Sproles you just wonder how much the Doral and Saints missed that guy we were talking to Philip Rivers in San Diego and I said you think they miss him a little bit he said they miss him I miss him in San Diego we're talking about rivers and Brees can commiserate in the 32 play action that by Sanchez a ton of time and in the past is a little high South could blow it in the rookie out of Oregon we therefore tip Billy Boy they had that they're gonna bootleg this way and throw back that way and it's wide open this can't miss this one this is a great play design freebie second 10 inside Avon strolls burrows to the 35 yard line third and long 3rd down and 7 now for Philadelphia Mark Sanchez said he'd never run the read option in his life before he got here and coach Kelly keeps telling me how easy it is it's not easy because the back doesn't know if he's going to get the ball or not they ran it over 30 times and that win and Thanksgiving over the Cowboys here comes the Blitz Saints his hangs in there fires caught first down sell it over the middle too tight lose the ball into Dallas territory to the 42 yard line autozone defense out of the Cowboys and Selleck just gets right in the middle that's a throw Sanchez day today Orlando Scandrick is down on the field one of the that people do whether this is the case here or not when an offense gets going have an injury the real or otherwise slow down the pace does it cost you a timeout and of course the crab knowing what's going on welcome there Scandrick so does he get hurt who knows it's you know it's a hand it's not like okay I'm I guess it's not going to be the fourth quarter but here no no good baby you know no I'm saying 60/40 12% okay 1288 from the 42 yard line and McCoy takes you to the 29 stop there by JJ Wilcox into the first down this is one of those what Sanchez go left back right and then scrolls goes back left again er LeSean McCoy on now and that issues in the past and continues and now you're getting McCoy going and this is what happened the last time it was but boy who got going and then the bootlegs in the play action off of that whale he snapped this one 12 seconds after very he's gonna get stuffed and now a third down and short coming up well that's one of those read options maybe Mark Sanchez should have kept let's see what happens if he holds on to this one right here so there's a late flag here at the 23 yard line would be pending a third down and two meanwhile offense number 18 defense number 39 fouls are set third down Macklin car and good good news of course the Scandrick didn't need to be hospitalized he's back in the game that's is very good news and there is Macklin down the field and car that's right at the 5 yards and said that's fine they're down at two Sanchez that though and that's a first down flag is from however is that first the number two tight end takes the ball with a fiveyard line flag is down at the 10 yard line on the other side there's the pond first that that's random car so backtoback fouls on him here's the read option pass now they come over and Mark Sanchez is not going to run this one he's going to throw it that is an alternative option and one really that Nick Foles does more of because he's not quite the runner that even Sanchez is now they're starting to look like the Philadelphia Eagles a little bit this will be the 11th play of a drive four runs six passes started back at their own 16 but this pulk in the game in the backfield and is going to take it into the end Chris Paul for the touchdown block hereby heaven man after the knee injury watch this one right here come out secure the first one take out Rolando McClain walk in touchdown for Chris Pole so one thing about the Philadelphia Eagles you ain't over that they can't score in a hurry and this Cowboys defense dude we're working 30 parking for the extra point they go 84 yards it only takes in 3 minutes and 24 seconds to get back in the game 21 7 Cowboys 7 New Year's Day celebrate one of the great traditions now in hockey the Blackhawks and the Capitals take it outside at Nationals Park in Washington and a cold winter threesome you see if you use day at one o'clock Chicago and a walk you see going on down by the diner ready football and four yards beep breaks the tackle and gets hogtied at the 27 yard line where the offensive line has done such a great job protecting Romo and Murray so they get a little bit of loan so he sends him boldly Vuitton travel bags better than that they get guests to bring told the love everything something yeah boy the offense was live and work is sending the air jordans iMac computers DeMarco Murray good to be an offensive London except when the referee says holding number 72 they have been terrific then combined with DeMarco Murray it's not a fastfood the Philadelphia Eagles have the fast offensive line athletic this is much more of a Power Group in the and sets up as the tight end on the right side 27 yard line carries to the 13 car cédric number 72 comes up with the ball but the play is dead we go to my shelf hey Ally ask Tyron Smith about those gifts starting with the shoes from Dez Bryant he said everyone loves Jordans he called the Louis Vuitton travel bags from Romo quote really useful and he sent one DeMarco Murray gave them the IMAX he thought wow he's really looking out for us good to be the best my offensive line of these days B's that was such a a problem area for them over the past few years where they went to the draft of the Frederick and Tyron smoothly another in the elite category second to me that's caught for a first down by Winton forward progress will let him the first and Witten will be caught one more than the Thanksgiving Day game is now for for tonight for 51 yards and the matchup starting to be favorable now they're able to work against Casey Matthews inside and the veteran Jason Witten is just sort of working the middle of the field and obviously Matthews had to go out for a period of time but if they can get matched up on that other linebacker Michael Kendricks very athletic Tamiko Ryan's was a great leader in their that coverage wise that's the weakness for Matthews and man watching they were a witness catches tonight was open in the first now and to the 41yard line goes maria tackle there by kendra channel murray he's gonna break image this record unless he gets hurt cowboy records he's on the pace to get two thousand yards he'd need three phenomenal games about 160 plus per game to beat Eric Dickerson smart averages five yards to carry big anova has a huge night tonight already has 47 yards next week Indianapolis a team that gave up 200 to Joan display against them in the last game is against Washington who knows second and six at the Lance Dunbar and Dunbar spinning around close to a first down really it's really started with these two in here and some of their combination blocks Travis Frederick a big strong guy we saw it last week in the Bears game just driving off the ball together but those two young players very bright guys able to work together they haven't made the big mistakes that young players tend to make knickers Tyron smith the hammer with the left tackle position the one to watch tonight where they had the issue in the last game is Ronald bunch of hawks inside see if they keep trying to get that match up normal has to take a timeout because that play clock was down to one so television the bench stirred down in one when we come back to the left a front right is Jeffrey Lurie the owner of the team this is luring Tina to removed and in the middle is Bradley Cooper with the Eagles cap huge thought of Avenger McDonough so yesterday Cooper will call from Europe wherever he is catches every Eva's game but tonight to this point I see the Eagles could get off the field five one year wall mode to play fake and Ramos gonna go down at the 43 yard line we've come into the sack and that'll be 14 and a half sacks for far away first the coverage down the field try to go a little double move from Dez Bryant but it is the guy with now 14 and a half sacks on the season Connor Barwon who comes in and makes another huge play and it looks like the momentum is starting to shift a little bit back towards the Eagles here first I've had held the Cowboys have been held on third down Chris Jones we'll be spotted out of a short kick 30 yard building with the ball down by 14 this is what Chip Kelly did in Oregon bring that fastpaced offense here since he took over 23 and a half seconds to play fastest in the lead 20 or more yards on plays 160 that's the top rushing yards per game second points per game for it so they went to Eugene Oregon got Kelly after Ian recently said even want the job and he came back thought about it again and time for the NFL second year in the league and the shoes his offense trying to get boy dances around with glugging the uarter to bury church comes up to make the stop and back they come to the line of scrimmage as quickly as they can and the question is always can they get the first first down they had an all night didn't have anything going get one first down to start that last drive and go right down the field second to knee to the outside back to the good place thinking and authority for a first night Zach Ertz and that gets the crowd excited everybody knows what's going to happen when the tight end catches the ball the cornerback is not big he's going to go after his knee so more and more of these tight ends are going will Skeets Nehemiah Macklin makes and Nachman their number one receiver having a career year and that's the first cash for him tonight actually has better numbers than does Dez Bryant but who would have calculated that each at ten touchdowns the cowboy 49 and he gets taken down to make the stock gain of seven second and three say this offensive line is getting going they are so excited to have Jason Kelsey and Evan Mathis back in the lineup LeSean McCoy telling us we can do without anybody but Jason Kelsey the center is the brains of the operation and he pulls better than any Center the playing football second and three boy again swings to the outside McClain can't stop him he gets around the corner and picks up the first down melanda mcclain if he has an issue that they have been working on is he can't tackle high every time he's a tall guy and he wants to go up there make those tackles and that's when he misses the domain of sixfour exposed its tripped up by the plane number 97 the Roma claim second down well Terrell MacLean inside and they felt the one advantage they had on Jason Kelsey was they could put MacLean right on the nose of the center Kelsey and take advantage physically to this size 14 seconds in pass over the middle of silicon in down machine for a first down to the 26 yard line obviously the other advantage you have and you're going this pass on offense but now because Selleck is a bit banged up they make a substitution so the Cowboys puts up here and they would have held that snap right arch comes in right side line goes to the left foot goes to the and it's dropped by jordan matthews a rookie out of Vanderbilt second round draft choice little read option once again read option pass this time try and get it down the field and say it Jordan Matthews has had such a big year for this team missed an opportunity there what 56 passes this season second down and 10 now from the 26 yard line remaining in the set up a screen that schools can go nowhere pressure was on that time Bruce Carter winds up making the tackle and it's going to make it third down and 13 and will take us to the twominute warning another blitz there Orlando Scandrick coming hard off the slot a little more aggressive tonight at a Rod Marinelli two minutes to the hand 217 down the sights of the night before they're the halftime coming up Pass Broncos and gulfs punch the divisions the Seahawks win their fourth straight and I thought the 49ers Bob Costas Hines Ward way in on the first half coming up at halftime to me which sin is the sin though in the 29 now it's third and 13 Sanchez dump it out of bounds to extend to the play he bought time but it's fourth down and you'd be looking at about a forty six yard field goal here I don't know what Sanchez was doing there that was clearly another one of those sort of throwback plays they were going to try back to the other side he scrambled right and there wasn't one receiver on that half of the field so Kody parky a rookie picked up in a trade in preseason from the Colts where's college boy Auburn this is a 47yard attempt the 10 miles in parkis kick is just good inside the left upright 148 to go it's an 114 injury Lincoln Financial Field some of the year's Eagles played at Veterans Stadium but three decades there before that franklin field the campus of the University of Pennsylvania Tony Romo ready to lead the Dallas Cowboys back out after they had a 21 nothing lead it's now turned into 21 to 10 from the 5yard line hours back of the tank see the coverage is great Chris precints key is there to make the tackle with 143 well there's a lot of conversation the Cowboys we're going to take a defensive player all three they wanted we're gone so they settled on Zach partners only turned out to be one of the top guards in all of football so far this season they're also full of conversations night event Johnny Manziel Maiden's debut as a starter today let it go so well so I think they were feeling pretty strong about Zach Partin who has completed this offensive line Lance Dunbar started running back Cowboys with 143 have already used to timeouts so one remains according their egos and would like love to see a three it out but here goes Dunbar Dunbar Gillison nice running so far tonight up to the 18 yard line making it second down and three you know Dunbar is a nice change of pace back usually used as a receiver more than a runner but there they saw backed up and entered in ball that's and take it out of the 29 yard line as Terrence Williams as important as anything was getting a few first downs and getting out of that hole you certainly didn't want to put that Eagles offense back out on the field again and you had a third down there he Philadelphia probably would have taken a timeout on defense can't think about that now you throw it underneath that is caught there by Lance Dunbar takes it out to the 35 yard line 52 seconds and tickin down Dallas conserving its final timeout we've seen this Dallas offensive long and on occasion gives Romo 6 7 8 seconds to throw the football makes the catch and beats the tries to get out of bounds and does at the 47 yard line to stop the clock with 33 seconds for Beasley three touchdowns in the last three games and really has opened up some opportunities maybe part of the reason the Jason Witten and Terrence Williams are catching more Vols Beasley in that slot has drawn a lot of attention now and now there's a little more balance across the board on who's getting the ball down the field numbers for Romo the 300 yard pace two touchdown passes both going Bryant's way and as queasily on Boyken out of the slide to Whitney he gets taken out of bounds that play only took four seconds it'll be second down and seven at the 50yard line here comes Kendricks right here up on the Blitz actually bring a couple of guys and Romo I'm not sure he could have done this on Thanksgiving what do you think Ali wasn't it his mobility was not at its best but now they're blitzing inside to see what happens when he moves been able to move just enough to get that completion and on three days rest without an injection that's for sure seven days left before the Chicago game pitching out ten days rest tonight second and seven those gone over the middle easily flag is thrown though bees so the flag stops the 22 seconds kind of leave second out it's a Doug free more the oldstyle Philadelphia Eagles defense here blank Benny curry way out here this old wide 9 and as Prairie tried to turn the corner it's a close call and sort of just pushed him down it almost looked like he was putting a little bit we've had a few close ones in here and no one went against the Cowboys so second down and 17 well out of field goal range here we do have a timeout then you get the second half kickoff the Cowboys will the Philly one across the third then watch the opening kickoff and depression sickness deep downfield and then throws out of bounds and the clock is stopped with 15 seconds all the matchups across the board Williams out there on des scramble brook girl starts there here's the coverage on Witten down the field and with through that hook out there to signal to his quarterback but really he wasn't open enough for Romo to move to his left and knit back around to make that conclusion third and 17 the other has that time axle to use threeman rush looking down the middle now running to top it off wash it down Williams is also down for the moment it's only about two or three yards past the line of scrimmage the line was the 40 if they decline the penalty you put Dallas into position where at least they're going to have to punt it illafford pass quarterback goes beyond the line number nine fiveyard penalty lost them down fourth down Philadelphia declines the tensecond run off down right to be is the tensecond one takes us to halftime this way at least they forced them in to a punt and here's the standard that back foot if it had gone on the line would have been legal plus we got Darren Sproles who is one of the top punt returners in all of football two touchdowns already and leads the NFL and punt return average so like guarantee he doesn't touch them I'm Dallas I just told Jones kick it out of bounds anywhere that'll take six seconds that's what they did the last time it wasn't much of a putt at least they didn't stick it to him Williams hobbles off where do you put a punt block on here rich massaging the special teams coach good one yep sure is then get it away schools just gonna let it bounce and that's going to bounce out of bounds and take us to his eye on the score Dallas 21 and Philadelphia 10 then we got next Dora messages from
