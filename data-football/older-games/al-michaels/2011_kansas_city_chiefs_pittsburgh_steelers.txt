============================================================

on a very chilly night in Kansas City Arrowhead Stadium as usual will be packed as the Pittsburgh Steelers come rolling into town to face the Chiefs on Sunday night Sunday night some of the most rabid and Michael's Cris Collinsworth the sealers coming in very good shape all the bye weeks of they're fresh they have a record of seven wins and three losses that Ben Roethlisberger does have a broken thumb but doesn't seem to be overly concerned he will get the start tonight and they faced a team that had already lost its number one quarterback for the season in Kansas City that she began the year with three losses and they won four in a row but now they've lost three more Matt Cassel is gone with a fractured hand he's on injured reserve and so Tyler Falco who fits the classic definition of the word journeyman 28 years old makes his second national football league start the other King six nights ago against New England Chris first let's talk about the Pittsburgh Steelers trying to get the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven years how do you assess this team at this point in November well they can't afford a slip here tonight because of those two losses to the Baltimore Ravens and their division and you're ready hit on the xfactor in this game Ben Roethlisberger's thumb we talked to him last night still having issues as far as taking a snap still hurts them to release the football how big a factor will it be in this ball game I'll decide the outcome watch it very carefully early on now Kansas City big underdog on the game and they give themselves a chance to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers and they're a deserve it underdog let's just tell the truth about that but football is a game of emotion and if nothing else the Kansas City Chiefs more emotional tonight we already saw that in the pregame warmups as they came out the two teams started hustling early the Chiefs do not believe that they are out of the race they think they still have a shot but they have to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers tonight and they are ready and we'll see that emotion can play over into the game before 76,000 in arrow they stayed in we'll see Mike Dallas and the rest of the Fitchburg Sooners on Sunday night NBC sports home of Super Bowl 46 welcomes you to the following presentation of the National Football League this afternoon in Cincinnati another comefrombehind win by the Bengals they beat Cleveland 23 to 20 thus in the AFC North Baltimore knocked off San Francisco Thanksgiving night they're already 83 Steelers 7 and 3 since he again back at 7 and 4 now moments ago coach Mike Tomlin of the Steelers spoke with Michele Tafoya coach Thanksgiving seems to mark a point in the season where teams start to separate themselves and make a push for the playoffs what do you need to see from your team tonight to know you're on that track we just need to have a winning performance tonight you know we're not a big big picture outfit I we're team coming off a bye we feel good about where we are but we have to put it on tape tonight the Chiefs have scored just one touchdown in their last three games Tyler Falco making just his second NFL start tonight how do you take advantage of his inexperience you know we just focused on what it is that we do we're attacking defense regardless of opponent we're gonna stay with they're not personality we respect these guys we anticipate them guys in particularly Tyler being better than he was last time out but that's irrelevant it's about how we play for us a little scuffle before the game you're Mike Wallace and savvy pit biscuit Ella from their team you got in the middle of it to sort of make peace what happened out there it was minor you know unfortunately so pushing and shoving but you know we're here to play football tonight as are they both sides in a nice job of quickly separating all parties involved the emphasis tonight is gonna be the game of football we're not forgetting its intended shenanigans thank you thank you these steamers at without linebacker Lamar worthy for the third straight week because of a hamstring injury and for the Chiefs they signed Grbac is inactive not sitting up tonight Thank You Michelle there is Todd Haley third season in Kansas City before that he was the offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals when they went to the Super Bowl and lost in the last minute to Pittsburgh Sean squeezin will be kicking off for Pittsburgh so we will see second year out of Alabama number two draft choice last year's run it back the city on this 36 degree son weenus downing it in the end zone let's take a look at the Chiefs offensive starters Joe's regime Dwayne Bowe they'll ask you Steve Breaston no credit because we're men the University of Georgia Brandon / UVA Rodney hustle water state kc Wigman Iowa very recent Chiefs have three running backs that start with Jackie battle in the backfield and he's a good special teamer is stopped as he presses the line of scrimmage Tyler Falco it's been an odyssey the one thing he did do though in college at Pittsburgh he beat out Joe Flacco for the job with the Panthers when they wants that got the job but he comes up to the line of scrimmage without a home and this is battle forcing his way out to the 30yard behind they'll Ron MacLean block and a first down exactly right LaRon MacLean right there and we're seeing this sudden offense if you will of the Kansas City Chiefs they don't want the Pittsburgh Steelers to have time to look at their formations and make adjustments so they come up and quick snap look at Paul Amato you couldn't miss him but he overruns the play and it's a three yard gain over the right side for Jacquie battle I think Troy Polamalu is getting this timed up coming up here but again when Ron MacLean makes a quick adjustment and gives his running back Jackie battle just enough time to make that little move to the west right and that's black/white Dwayne and that's a first down does go takes it out to the 43 yard line it's a two first downs Tork and Timmons in on the tackle one of the things the Chiefs felt like they could do is throw a right at Troy Polamalu they felt like he's too fast to throw away from on the 43 now taken down is battle by Troy Polamalu got his left arm around his legs and knocks him down after a very short game it's one thing to try and block pull the mauler with a fullback another with a wide receivers this time it's enough of battle where this is fast they're coming out and as soon as they break the huddle it feels like they're snapping the ball very much the way they started against the Patriots in Foxborough and Dexter McCluster is the back they give it the name and he goes taken down at the 48 yard line by James Ferriero gives him a pretty good pop boy James Farrior did he slipped right back through the offensive line and laid a big hit on the back that time Ferrier can still bring it in his 15th season now Thomas Jones is the back excuse me to the 27yard line he another Kansas pity first down put this piece back on his bone 20 zone defense and cotton across and route underneath and that's what opened up the deep throw but the protection in behind was the key Steve Maneri an extra offensive lineman motion to the fullback position and gave power palco time so we have seen all three running backs on this first series of the game you know that little fight at the beginning of this game I didn't know if it was real or maybe it would wake up the Pittsburgh Steelers but you just got a little taste of the emotion of the Kansas City Chiefs coming out the offensive linemen up in the backfield swing it to him when he makes the taxon photo model even though he sees number 68 is right there he smelled although his dad still doubt on the branch here at Arrowhead Stadium makes the tackle smelled the playout Maneri is sixsix and 290 pounds of time Sunday night football brought to you by Southwest Airlines you can find our fares online only at Southwest Calm by Chevrolet and their awardwinning cars trucks and crossovers by old the happiest holidays are May that fun ovations Inc and by windows 7 is a great time to be a family and a lot of families here in Kansas City at Country Club Plaza the annual Plaza lights ceremony there's Polamalu who has to come out one day takes your spot third down and six now 23 yard line exchange shifting over to those left side across the field and that's me we trusted that time by Jason walls intended for Breaston and Kansas City we'll settle for a field goal attempt the Offensive Player of the Year typo it's going to hit the right knee is Steve Maneri and of course Paulo Malo has had history with concussions and now because of the new league rules he'll go through a whole protocol over on the bench to see whether or not he can play Brian suck up with a 41 yard came to city the which caused her to go in the opening quarter you can multitask oh right there at NBC sports.com / yes and that's check it out a lot of good stuff a lot of good stuff for keys wait a mindmeld yeah that was kind of fun to watch they attack the Steelers suck up will tick off a manual does he 18 Langford and let's take a look at the Steeler starters Ben Roethlisberger's Miami University Rashard Mendenhall Illinois David Johnson Arkansas State Mike Wallace will karlova High School Antonio Brown Central Michigan Kate Miller Virginia Mac Stars Florida Gators dougla Garcia Marshall University marquise Pouncy tomorrow foster swimming suit Marcus Gilbert University school Rafi's bruising Rashard Mendenhall who gets to the 21 yard line so the indestructible Roethlisberger playing through that broken thumb with a splint we'll have to watch where the handoffs tonight and also they may use a little bit of that pistol formation a sure shot gun as well but they don't want to they feel like it because ben roethlisberger is so big the backs can't see it there you go takes an early snap he running plays this week Charlie Bash did that because of that thumb your turn Hockley making the corner wide bringing in extra guys onto the field and so the penalty will send them back to the 16 yard line and make it second down and 12 and with that thumb injury you know the Steelers would love to have success running the have recently first down more and more lemonade he's in the game the data is to make that tax and that's John McGraw the safety making the stop and let's take a look at that chief defense I see Jackson Louisiana State Kelly Greg Oklahoma Glenn dosage how this you just Agusta Georg von belching named Derek Johnson Texas tomba Holly Penn State Brandon Flowers to John McGraw and doors open and Johnson the left side the tight end the office burger feels the pressure gets hit as he throws and gets it away and it's brought by ants have an attack of the season out to the 33 yard line as they convert on third and long 417 yards a couple of things to see here one Ben Roethlisberger holding this ball with two hands because he knows he doesn't have the same grip then he's going to get hit on that hand did it impact the thumb time you wouldn't know from Ben Roethlisberger's expression but that's what they're hoping doesn't happen elbow instead festive Houston the 33yard where's travelers well a lot of black and gold in the stands tonight and the see here that chant he kenric Lewis just missed this one number 23 sees Heath Miller coming thinks he has it all the way and just missed getting a hand on that football but Ben Roethlisberger bad thumb and all with backtoback bluffs grows to get the Steelers off the 37 hi less often of late the benda and mike tomlin saying they've got him at 30 plays in for him tonight or he should be in for let's say 30 plays around right here is one of the more athletic linebackers in the game Derek Johnson chase here as that play started it really looked like it might turn into something dented Alan Johnson able to run it down of milestones with the bench has they've been tricking him second down and the 42 yard line Roethlisberger going deep in the fashion broken up intended for Antonio Brown of two flags condemned random car was back there Hockley we'll check it out Little John going on here with Lewisohn Brown there were photos on both teams in the play holding offense number 78 the affairs we play further down so the only go on max storage yeah that is a pretty easy call to see that one didn't surprise me at all this one I thought was a little closer the contact down the field wasn't enough for the pass interference was the interesting part of that a little bit late and I think the fact that the contact was initiated by Antonio Brown was a good play on his part and I don't think second down and Pittsburgh this border down the far sideline that's caught five brown and Negus forced out of bounds it's in yard line they can get first down and goal the Kansas City Chiefs one of the few teams in the league a penalty is declined the play results in first down on the offside one of the few teams in the league that will play bump and run mantoman coverage on the Steelers wide receivers see Brandon Flowers at the top gets his head around but this Antonio Brown has really become something you know we've been talking about Mike Wallace and all that he does that the emergence of Antonio has given balance to this passing game play running back tics as well Roethlisberger takes a timeout first and goal and we come back the Kansas City Ben Roethlisberger first down and goal of the ER and Ben has gotten off the hot starts this year take a look at those numbers in the first quarter five touchdowns nil picks very high rating for pass attempt averages started at the Pittsburgh in the back of the end zone completing tending for free Mike Wallace on playaction look like a pretty routine catch I don't know check this out but Mike Wallace just basically beat them across the back of the inline here and VIN comes back finds them unless that ball was tipped I'm not really sure how I missed it it was just a drop Susan its skirmish before the game she's six points go away sting chuckling again and the Chiefs recovery of the for spending Remus with a recovery what's tonight tree lighting time Christmas all Rockefeller Center with Justin Bieber Mike among others Christmas in Norwalk Center Wednesday 8 o'clock Eastern and Pacific right here on NBC missing it's hard at work on this 36 degree night Tama Holly for eating the forced fumble shaking his head Clark and let's go back to the forced fumble talking to Heath Miller they were saying that tom hollie is one of those guys they respect so much because he plays until the whistle blows play after play that that made the difference foot paced offense tonight this is Jones Polamalu was still on the bench and we go to Michelle yeah he is standing on the sidelines the official reporters that he took a blow to the head and he's being evaluated much of that evaluation just questionandanswer talking to him dick came over to check he knows that he's okay but still on the sideline out Thank You Michelle you sold a bow standing next to him obviously he wants to get back in the game in his head thanks to the outside is caught by Thomas Jones Virginia gets tackled by another University of Virginia guy and James farriers now one of the things that the Pittsburgh Steelers wanted to do tonight as they described it throw the kitchen sink at Tyler palco well a lot of that kitchen sink is in the form of Troy Polamalu and they can't do it now and three we'll set up a third down and short Thomas Jones whose brother Julius last year was the New Orleans running back at the end of the season because they have so many injuries but secondmost among active players in over 10,000 Chicago on the ground and the Pittsburgh Steelers come up with a threat be sold and the Chiefs had a golden opportunity to try to take advantage of a big turnover and then send it right back into the arms of the black and gold AC wagon in the center for whatever reason this just simply does and this is what the Kansas City Chiefs can they had all the momentum they got the turnover even if you punt the football in that situation you back them up you give a great team like the Pittsburgh Steelers this kind of field position Steelers in speaking she was gonna leave taken down by Hallie at for a gain of 1 when you watch the tape with tom hollie out here you know these not just the pass rusher is he the entirety of the pass rush for the Kansas City Chiefs pretty much but he is an allround player and when you watch him does such a great job with his hands we even saw him in three almost like black belt like movies getting ready for the to the 33 and again you and I were sitting up here looking at the Hallie and it's how do you break a sweat like that on a 36 degree night you and I are up here drinking coffee anything we can to stay warm and he played a game before they ever started this game but you can see he thinks this is handy again loses the ball but after he was down hit the ground first and they'll spotted at the twenty nine a little short of the first down it'll be fourth down upcoming coming off this edge this time it's just in Houston who's going to force them up out the pockets gonna get the sack and then loses the ball and it's going to be close but how many times has been Roethlisberger they send everybody you thinking oh boy they're gonna take a shot down the field and there he is taken off I think we talked about something about his thumb before the game and as usual it's an odd fact absolutely so they measure and he comes that close to picking up the first down until they call for the measurement he was leading them to the line of scrimmage they were ready to run a very quick play before Kansas City could make any substitutions so it's fourth down and a couple of links in Isaac Redmond comes in the ballgame over the last two years the second best runningback Haley's going to challenge and that's one of the reasons I think Roethlisberger was trying to get to the one that quickly feeling that even me humble so Haley now wants them to check it up check it out upstairs goes over with Hockley we'll take another look is he down first which was the pole on the field can't tell can't overturn it from that in the field that the runner was down by concept before the ball starts to come loose is he down inoculated check it out very close Ed Hochuli is just now emerging the ball is moving the ruling down by contact here's oculi the rudder was down before he lost possession of the ball although it came loose to his hand he had controlled the ball in his arm therefore the ruling on the field stands although we won't move the ball back to the 30yard line when his knee hit down the ball was at the 30yard line and Kansas City has charged his first time out there are no changes to the clock so it's fourth down in a yard and a half right now which was why Roethlisberger was trying to to get to the line foot but here it is again this one will be talked about for a while the ball is moving here and according to Ed Hochuli he regains possession there but I think that one could be argued either way I really do I mean there have been a lot of moving ball tricks in this league this year and is that really possession a huge call in this game well it's not a conventional way of obviously of carrying the thing but I thought Hockley was pretty precise in his definition of what he saw and Pittsburg keeps control that have been a catch and going to the the catch down and a short from the 30 yard Roethlisberger avoids a sack then he gets hit that's juggled and and a first down is picked up by Redman so Ben Roethlisberger the master at extending plays does it again slips out rettenmund juggles gets possession of it first down now this is why Ben Roethlisberger is simply one of the best in the game there was nothing there they had nothing he just scrambled around and I'll bet you Isaac Redmond is the fifth receiver on that route there's no way he's in the progression I've seen it the last couple weeks he's found guys that no quarterback would find that Redman was actually on the ground weeping the ass flag is grown and then after the moment would set up a first and goal to have two flags back at the 25yard line and the Steelers know this is coming back holding offense number 83 the printers the crew first outside and Heath Miller yeah this was going to be major news as far as I was concerned if the Steelers had done something on an outside run they just simply they've averaged one point four yards per carry on outside runs this season so they get one there and immediately you're sort of looking for how did they do that well that's how they did that a little grab of the jersey and they were caught so the Chiefs hanging in here every time it looks like the Steelers are getting something down something breaks their way the crowd in the game and this is a passionate seventysix thousand store and so far they were joining custom 22 the 34yard from the outside before he gets taken out of bounds you know Brown it in a way with the emergence and now you've got a fight on the field and here we go again you got pounced he involved in it you got Wallace involved in it again he got Kendrick Lewis involved in it again Wallace and Lewis go all the way back Hines Ward seemed to see a little bit of the action as well all these fights I'm starting to look around for Lenny Dawson somewhere you know this is this is like the old days and when these two teams used to go at it or Gil Clancy yeah really second down and 18 with a ball at the 32 nothing changes this corrugated living today 307 time in his career he has been sacked Amon Gordon the night gets in there here working against her own foster inside they slide that way but fostered not quick enough to get over there the City Chiefs who have very few aha the second set for any of the ways inside his suit it's tipped at all intercepted it was almost picked off was deflected away by a rhiness 4th and 29 Javier Arenas with this to man coverage underneath right here really in perfect position and the Kansas City Chiefs to win this game they have to make interceptions like that they just have to make those kinds of plays tonight to hang around with the Pittsburgh Steelers Henrik Lewis with a great opportunity Jerry katha knows surgery so it will be down at the 7yard line and that's where the Chiefs good with five six left of the quarter pretty nothing cases the NFL play 60 program encourages children and families to live active and healthy lives the Kansas City Chiefs actively supporting the program with the Chiefs Sports lab powered by blue KC the sports level identify atrisk children for obesity with a three step program education on healthy living place 16 skeleton waning seconds the 30 inside of the ten takes it to the six and that will take us to the end of the first quarter least 15 yards underthrown by tyler falco highrisk and that is the end of the first quarter second quarter we'll start with the first and over 3nothing mentioned before swisherd the second quarter the fielders six takeaways and ten games and tonight they have two so we start don't deploy and Kansas City first down and goal maurices the failure Derek Johnson making the tackle and back to the interception the only thing I can possibly think is that this was but if it was Steve Breaston had no idea that he was trying to get behind palkó through it like it was back shoulder and so one of the twos wrong just not sure exactly who it is backtoback ways of the pick and so adieu Isaac Redmond he gets to the maybe three and a half and it will be third down and goal yeah we just haven't seen any issue at all from Ben Roethlisberger with his hand he told us that he really was most concerned about taking snaps he really probably would prefer to cut stay in shotgun the fuse in the creek they would listen is profitable walk that and it's incomplete for a swag is Sanders so it'll be fourth down and that defense does the job again fourth and goal interesting this time the pic works against the Pittsburgh Steelers are coming here and yet they kind of knock each other off as they go with the crosser he just run the fade route there he might have had a chance but they pick each other miss Kansas City Chiefs defense has been sation or social and that will tie the game the second quarter three three in Tylar Palko trying to make an impression and couple of mistakes in a row last two snaps fumbled there and threw an interception on the next one over back coach this week was you can't give so the cluster downs it in the end zone well we're talking about Matt Cassel broken hand a couple of weeks ago he's their number one they went out and they got Kyle Orton this week released by Denver because Tebow is taken over there and again Tebow did it in San Diego today but the question becomes who's the quarterback next week for Kansas City well it depends on what Tyler palco does I mean clearly what everybody has told me if he plays well tonight it will be his job so far he has not played well enough to keeper the other quarterback is the rookie stains so that's three in succession now valuable as a backup quarterback you're singing why tonight he threw a hard slider on this what he was thinking I don't know what he was trying to do but the ball almost turned right here and Monday is just like Ike Taylor saying are you throwing that to me the Kansas City Chiefs defense played brilliantly against the Patriots a week ago until has made so many mistakes they finally realize how much do they have 24 yard line beautiful delay a whistle before the snap so the only other quarterback they have would be the rookie Ricky Stanzi before the ball was snapped false start offense number 78 fiveyard penalty in his first down and we'll check with Michelle again well Marquis spouse he has gone to the locker room I'm told by the Steelers stat that he has an illness and Allen early pregame warmups he was not out here with the rest of his offensive linemen other guys were practicing snapping the football to other players and they must have known he came into this game with an illness so thank you michelle Gursky moves over from guard to center and liberty has supplanted chris quinoa to in the starting line so team a out to his back at at left guard in the locker room first and 15 laughs this burger against sensing that pressure in frozen Miller with a flag thrown was hit as the ball got there just been used in that time came in and pop Roethlisberger II as he got the pass away oculi ready to make the call ball getting there just as the defender got there pushing one of the officials of holding Paul here I think it's Derek Johnson on the hole but not positive we'll wait and see there were two fellows by the defense on the play feigning a contact there were 24 this six line there was also holding defense number 56 that foul occurred before the pass was thrown automatic first down you've got it Johnson but again it's happening because they can't get ben roethlisberger on the ground and there's three four five six seconds sometimes that these guys are having to cover down the field and mantoman coverage and it's breaking down this defense like it always does and Ben Roethlisberger is going to take one right first container about the Steelers and bull weather or the history and running the ball and all that forget about that that's an illusion right now the Pittsburgh Steelers are a passing team they're faster on ratio is 6040 pass to run yeah and it has been quite a transformation I'm not sure that the fans at Pittsburgh who are always behind that we used to hear the cry for Bruce Arians get a fourth back but you want with you the other side and that pass is incomplete Swagger's cream jerkin tree as incense this one did brain as I think knocking the ball away was but the official on the other side of the field saw I think was his right arm hooking the shoulder pads of Khatri Hockley will mediate let's see does the right arms or what no call for pass interference on the play so one official overrules the other is what it amounts to I think that's the right call I do too you know I mean flowers here doesn't cook him doesn't turn him with that right arm is there some contact there is but the defenders allowed to go for the ball as well and I think that's I think they got it right they got it right at the so much of this page the city defense let's see if they can hold another field goal attempt there they come and they get up at the 30th floor as advanced news but the play was whistled dead and that's Bali and there's a flag down there's a flag down on the secondary only that and all this being coverage and it's almost hard to believe they could hold in that instance there wasn't enough time the sack happens so quickly you wouldn't think where you would think before the ball came out he was down holding defense under 47 to care the big assignment right here on Heath Miller and it's that tug of the Jersey and it's just the thing that they're going to call you saw McGraw turn around he almost knew that he had done it that sack happened so fast from Tama Holly it's amazing by way of penalty take the ball tackled by Cardenas six second and four you know it's a doubleedged sword it really is you know that you have to get pressure there's Tyler Falco and he's got to be shaken is that it is performance at this point you have to get pressure on Ben Roethlisberger but at the same time it puts tremendous pressure on your back end and that mantoman coverage because those guys know that they have to do anything they can five or six seconds and he'll make it a first down Shepard looks looks pump fake pump fake throws underneath completion at least his fifth receiver here three four fifth read he comes up with another first down you know VIN has really come a long way as a quarterback in his early days I don't know if he'd admitted it or not he was not finding the fifth receiver he was taken off and running now he's playing the position sometimes his first reason is the receiver number one he comes back as the 63 the same guy the second lap around the track in his book for a touchdown by wisly some Cougars at the back of the endzone you could talk about this play all day what a play by Ben you look like a bullfighter gets his feet in holds on that's his first catch touchdown Pittsburgh here's the first look Leslie Saunders who they think is the next Heath Miller around here but it was the Olay in the backfield by Ben Roethlisberger that really made the play is for a touchdown reception of the season season they just asked the defense to do me much to first pounds on penalties that Saunders in the back of the end zone first touchdown of the night belongs to the Pittsburgh Steelers who now lead 10 Tonight Show this week Jay Leno welcoming Governor Rick Perry Bill Cosby will be there Melissa McCarthy will be there as well the Tonight Show with Jay Leno this week Union Station in fantasy it's planted at the 19 yard line by Ryan on Monday 10:47 remaining in the half 10:00 to 3:00 Pittsburgh in 2007 NFL play 60 s for travelling the country helping the youth of America to be more active and healthy vlog on and if a rough stop calm slash bus 18 yard line first down she said Brown was booing when when palco came out but I mean what were they looking for Lynn Dawson yeah I would be on that occasion to it plus they're staying with this hurry up so if they don't pick up a first down here this defense that's exhausted is gonna have to go right back out again lettuce here tonight do this is jackie battle up to the 22 yard line you know sometimes there you have to make ingame adjustments is this nohuddle working is it it is but you also see now they're going to go back into the hustle into the huddle here and there's the I desk back up Ricky stands 'is the number two tonight a rookie and do you want to throw him out there against the Pittsburgh Steelers his career at Iowa 26 and 9 is a starter for the hawkeye's Dexter McCluster losing the game third down building his church not going to be enough for a first down as Bo is hidden to make detach the jason world's makes the tack on and it's rough at that point we've got a quarterback that's turned it over three straight times are you really willing to take a chance that he's gonna throw a 4th and they just wanted to get a completion for mr. Coldfoot to boot it by floating kick at the 27 yard line it is fair caught there by Antonio Brown so here comes Ben again with a fractured thumb but that's nothing for him we talking about it's the same thing he did what a few years back well sprained left foot last year of course he had that broken nose and the game we did and a fractured going to the right foot separated right shoulder and o8 and he is Superbowl year broken right on cartilage in the right knee was torn three concussions in his career mr. just one game again leading his team to a mark of seven and three the month took a look at the tshirt that's pretty exciting their second timeout of the head a major understatement to say the difference in this game has been the quarterback play but Ben Roethlisberger has been simply the pocket is great at big plays but this is one of the prettiest touchdowns lay and then lofts a perfect little touch pass over the top or the touchdown cups offical broken perfect pass Roethlisberger's going to go deep trying to hit please Mar was Paragon the played good coverage might have gotten a piece of it second down and ten that's the second one that Mike Wallace's had at least a chance despite this humongous coach 10 hearts the Steelers don't care they're just gonna let Mike Wallace run and he does runs right by car did he have a chance yes he did he did was not deflected the bench for the moment second down and ten Redmond had brought Miller into the back field and provided a convoy for Redmond just doesn't matter this Steeler offensive line keeps on rolling Chris camo a two with what he does best going to come across with this trap block out here and came a lot to the one thing that they did not like with replacing him with Doug was the fact they were gonna lose his ability to poll we watched the Steelers over the years 33 now working right to the 35yard line looks like it's gonna be a hole but did he pick up the first down that would be the second question they did nothing of the first day number 73 a penalty is declined brings up fourth down so it's a Ramones foster and he's a yards shy of the first down he'll be fourth down and one well we saw Ramon foster earlier unable to get into the gap in creating some pressure on Ben Roethlisberger that time he got there but goal a beer awareness mother Turner 31 yard line ten three Pittsburgh well this has been through the years a tremendous homefield advantage they had only two years in a quarter century with losing records however since oh seven thirteen and twenty four year and that's inclusive of a seven and one mark last year so six and twentythree if you erase all of 2010 so it used to be a tremendous advantage has not necessarily been so even though this is as close to a college atmosphere as you'll see in any NFL stadium dresses in red in three years has been just a terrific place to watch a football game as Thomas Jones to the 34yard line long time since the Kansas City Chiefs have scored a touchdown to one touchdown in the last 40 offensive drives almost unheard of second and seven had a weird year I mean they started out they were terrible at the outset remember on opening day this was a team that got destroyed here by Buffalo 417 week two they lost 48 to three in Detroit leave James Harrison unblocked at your own risk third down four with a very deep drop and then completes that one across the 50 and that is Steve Breaston and a flag is down in the secondary and if an ineligible man downfield or 12 guys on the field right another Powell code no it's gonna miss Brooke it's going to go and see there were 12 men in the field by the defense twelve guys despite 12 guys they still completed it and it's a first down at the 45 yard line formation to get some easier releases that one had to feel good for Tyler Falco completed against 12 guys maybe the cluster is the back Lester takes the world to be 41 yard line wonder they were three running backs is Dexter McCluster than the third down gobbles gonna probably see more and more action out of Mississippi drafted in the second round in 2010 miss to learn to hold on to the ball but as they say a guy you want to get each space 2nd down and 7 takes the ball to the 35yard line and that's a first down it's kind of interesting how the Kansas City Chiefs do this draw they always get somebody down the field one of these linemen it looks almost like a screen pass when you're watching it on tape but it is Dexter McCluster who without Jamaal Charles in there is probably the only big play threat on this offense right now from the 35 being of let's go to Michele al the Steelers aren't releasing any new information on Troy Polamalu he's been on the sidelines since taking that hit to the head in the first quarter earlier he would stand on the sidelines with his helmet on but the last several minutes he's just been standing there stocking cap on and sweatpants on over his football pants no helmet anywhere so it it doesn't look as though he's coming back anytime soon now Thank You Michele as I used to say it's like getting information out of the old East Germany when it comes to this sort of stuff he ain't coming back second down and eight not tonight and that's a two yard game for Thomas to the 31 now slowing it down a little bit and I think they were playing to their defense to some extent you're seeing them huddle a little bit more they simply had to give their defense a chance to rest and for Tyler Falco maybe he's catching his breath now that completion down the middle the breasts and they got something going cluster to the right side then that pass is incomplete scores it's by William Gay and sport down at six a little bit of a derivation of their cross blitz inside that time out of the nickel formation bring a linebacker and bring a corner and too much pressure for Falco because they're gonna come right there and bring the linebacker in here as well a lot of times they go right over the center with that blitz that time went over the tackle this will be a 49yard attempt for Orion suckup 39 or try to pointing jeez at least keeping a goat despite those three turnovers 33° now in America's heartland Brett Keisel he's a good one he is starring in a commercial now Latroy Paulo his beard waving it's always good to see the big guys getting a little commercial time too say they have veteran players around here who play for a long time they though the system they know what Dick LeBeau wants to do he was talking about it you know that a sister meet his father before authorities back by Sanders here takes the ball out to the 23 yard line they take a look at that Chiefs defense they have blended or see he was their number one pick out of LSU and in Oh a Tyson Jackson the morn pick out of LSU and in all nine and you take a look at those guys and then you look at that defenseman as we say the key guys defensively are Holly and Johnson when you think about the Patriots defense over the years and this obviously Romeo shots those guys get to the 29 you know thinking about Kansas City they won the division last year but you think about you play a fourthplace schedule which they did last year they only played two teams that finished above 500 San Diego and Indianapolis and they had no injuries this year a lot of injuries and impactful injuries at the beginning of the year yeah and I think Jamaal Charles and Eric Berry really the two key ones on each side of the football so much of this offense was built off of playaction because everybody had to they lost Charles in the second game of the stream this is more who had before fumble to the 40yard line take a look at the schedule this year they play the first place schedule and here it is beginning tonight until December 18th those four teams that's last year's final four Steelers Chicago the Jets in cream Bay all looking to the championship games and of course Green Bay of Pittsburgh went to the Super Bowl and somebody in Kansas City has got to be saying what did we do huh we offend and then they warmed up for it by going to Foxborough last week before the Patriots had their chances this guy give it to brat he's gonna throw or attempt to throw anyway bound by the Roethlisberger extending the play with only just so far Roethlisberger helping out with a block and after all that it's a gain of 3 yards tom hollie out there getting pressure but it was the block by Ben Roethlisberger for watching as he peels back is gonna help out his quarterback how about that he flips Javon Belcher there you go he's an allpurpose guy he's been putting on a show tonight but for Kansas City's defense this is really a key moment that a beautiful box mrs. Sanders a couple of games his mother died early in the month and he also had knee surgery at his back tonight that takes us to the twominute warning ten six Pittsburgh to the halftime show coming up Tim Tebow's leading the Broncos to an overtime win in San Diego Tom Brady and the Patriots pummeling the Eagles and Bible weigh in on that stevie johnson of the bills first attendant it's in the hands of another Steeler receiver Emmanuel Sanders comes down with it after the welding war had a deflect off his hands first down well when you're hot you're hot 90% of these tip balls end up as interceptions and this happened Upendra office burger ends up with to the outside is a very short game more tackled by Johnson and they get stopped inbound so the clock keeps moving Romeo Crennel szpach has played so well this half if they could just hold the Steelers to a field goal it's amazing it's only a fourpoint game three turnovers and the way the Kansas City offenses after that first series second down and seven on the dirty pressure on by the Supreme pocket for the hands of Heath Miller covered by John McGraw John McGraw missed the game last week but he really has the key matchup here trying to shut down Heath Miller gets his head around doesn't hold on this one that's the matchup that more often than not whenever Ben sees that mantoman coverage all the way across the field and the safety on we've got a whistle here any Kansas City time a timeout chief Sunday Night Football you by Geico 15 minutes could save you by Geico 15 minutes could save you 15% on car insurance by McDonald's I'm will loving it by Nissan for today innovation for tomorrow innovation for Capital One venture card of what is in your wallet Chiefs Hall of Fame Arrowhead Stadium funneling the history of this team which began as the Dallas Texans founded by the great Lamar Hunt Lemar founded the American Football League and then move the team to Kansas City after three years in is complex which was built in the early 70s backtoback stadiums with the Chiefs and the Royals and they were way ahead of their time sure were way ahead and so is Lamar Hahn he was the glue that 37 now to dance away under pressure here he goes again he gets it away but this time it is more who cannot escape the grasp at the 32yard line and that's savvy piscatella who just wouldn't let go and make sure he got into the ground yeah but that was a huge sequence there because if tom hollie had gotten this sack or if there had been a hold which there may well have been on that play you're out of field goal position right over here watch this see if this one looks like a hold and I think Mac starts gets it down just in time but the ability to escape again the difference to give the Steelers a chance to put points on the board and with three Steelers in there get piscatella able to grab a hold of this shirt knock them down at the 31 and then Pittsburgh takes a timeout with three seconds left to shut up will be a half ending field goal well mike tomlin he knew what this was going to be about tonight this is around the league we're seeing a lot of teams sort of with their last stand and we're seeing tremendous efforts out of it if you watch the Jets and Buffalo today boy they went at it till the very end because they basically knew the loser was eliminated the Jets came out on that one and we're seeing that same kind of effort by the Chiefs tonight squeeze him that to attempt a sevenpoint game Haley so no Kansas City that's their third time out we take a time out to the field we saw it in the middle a lot of football here in addition she's yesterday Kansas played Missouri so good footing here for and the tech is big next time at Arrowhead Stadium and the score is Pittsburgh 13 Kansas City six coming up next the Toyota halftime show after these messages from your local NBC station welcome to the Toyota halftime show brought to you by Toyota moving forward so the Chiefs keep it close and competitive but given their lowkey air offensive lake seven points actually looks like a pretty big deficit to New York we go and Dan Patrick all right Bob thank you with Tony Dungy Rodney Harrison thoughts on the first half rod Kansas City's plan tough but if you're Kansas City you have to find a way and that means Blitzen to get to Ben Roethlisberger he's run around making plays he has all day back there if I'm Todd hailing in that Chiefs locker room I'm pumping the guys up because we've turned the ball over three times and we're still just one big play away from from being tied up all right let's show you the highlights week 12 we start with Mark Sanchez four touchdown passes wasn't always pretty only threw for 180 yards but a career best four touchdowns this one is Santonio Holmes put the Jets ahead for good they improved to six and five Browns Bengals biggest rookie connection made it happen again tied the fourth Andy Dalton AJ Green set up the gamewinning field goal Bengals down seven and four they got Pittsburgh coming up next weekend Tucson's Jaguars broadest day for Arian Foster 43 on this we were first set up a oneyard touchdown run Jackson losing backliner to a reported broken collarbone but they pick up the win vicodin Vikings in the Falcons Matt Ryan third touchdown pass but the Falcons up by 10 Percy Harvin the ensuing kickoff and this is the longest non scoring play in NFL history Falcons got a goal line stand they won five of their last six Patriots Eagles Tom Brady Wes Welker Eagles fall to four and seven eight catches 115 yards and two touchdowns Bears Raiders carson palmer's threw for 300 147 on this pass to Lewis Murphy Oakland's only touchdown inauspicious start to the Caleb Hanie era Bears lose for the first time since week five Broncos Chargers in overtime will gain 117 yards gamewinning field goal 37 yards out Matt Prater the Broncos now 5 in 1 with Tim Tebow as the starter it's a special team when when you got a bunch of guys that when things aren't going good and we get closer instead of pulling apart and I think that's really special as I've said I don't know if he's a good quarterback but he's a valuable quarterback what do you make of the Broncos he is very valuable the Broncos believe that they can win and that's half the battle there in the West race since tbones become the starter his teammates believe in him and that's really important they're on the road in Minnesota coming up next week and your dream team the Eagles listen Dan I played on a 1 in 15 team I played on a 16 and old team and I realize one thing it's not all about Talent and part of that coach as you know it's about coaching being prepared being accountable and the Eagles are very undisciplined team you have DeSean Jackson meat/meat missing meetings you have players running out of coverages blowing coverages dropping balls in the end zone and that's why they have the record that they were booing Andy Reid during this game DeSean Jackson got benched during the game coming up Bob Costas on the bills Stevie Johnson's to display at the Meadowlands today but first time to announce the winner of Toyota's halftime handoff back now in Kansas City for those of you too busy keeping up with the kardashians to notice we live in a culture that in many ways grows more stupid and graceless by the moment sports both reflects and influences that trend so on playing fields everywhere true style is in decline while mindless exhibitionism abounds in the late 60s the Giants had a receiver named Homer Jones he invented the spike and it was great a simple elegant punctuation that somehow has devolved into this given the tone of the times it's probably too much to expect that most players would appreciate that back in the day this guy was much cooler than this guy or that there's a difference between spontaneous and or goodnatured displays of enthusiasm and calculated displays of obnoxious selfindulgence know that train has already gone so far down the wrong track there's probably no turning back so our suggestion here is a more modest one hey knuckleheads is it too much to ask that you can find your buffoonery to situations that don't directly damage your team week after week game after game we see guys who think nothing of incurring penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct costing their team's valuable yardage even late in close games today's most conspicuous culprit Buffalo's stevie johnson who after a TD catch versus the Jets thought it would be a good idea to go Marcel Marceau pantomiming among other things Plex ago Burroughs shooting himself in the leg but in this case it was Johnson who shot himself in the foot as his display cost his team a 15yard penalty on the ensuing kickoff and given a short field the Jets proceeded to score in a critical game that wound up 2824 New York which raises this question where are the coaches in all this guys are routinely benched are called out for blown assignments one is a coach going to make an overdue statement and sit a guy down on the grounds of pure selfishness and unprofessionalism detrimental to his team by the way late in the loss of the Jets Johnson dropped a pass that could have led to a buffalo win shockingly he didn't follow it with a rehearsed my bad dance of apology maybe he just forgot back with the second half from Kansas City after this this has been the Toyota halftime show brought to you by Toyota moving forward Portsmouth as that would picked off for this has been simply sensation and you can follow your favorite team all season long that itunes.com slash and have third quarter the beginning 13 to 6 Pittsburgh Al Michaels Chris Collinsworth and Michele Tafoya Arrowhead Stadium three Kansas City turnovers Dean has the feel of a game that Pittsburgh should be leading by about 17 and said it's a 7 point game Pittsburgh will get the ball Brian suck up see from the Warner Sanders pastor 20 taken down at the 31 flames the ploy epochal is the referee tonight during the return holding by the receiving team number 54 10yard penalty from the spot of the foul Pittsburgh keeps the ball first down first car here and we go to Michele well Mike Tomlin told me at halftime outlet if Troy Polamalu was in any danger of having a concussion or furthering his head injury he would not return he is not back out on the field and will not return to this game Esper Todd Haley I asked him about his offense he said Tyler Falco just needs to make better decisions take care of the football if they can stop the turnovers he thinks they have a chance at this point he has no plans of taking Tyler all right Thank You Michelle meanwhile Klaus he was still out of the game Nagurski is the scent the short mini hair the really interesting stories of the first half has been the play of Max starts the left tackle here that was cut in preseason because the shape he went to Arizona worked it off got updates all the how he was doing and lobbied hard to get him back then you can see why certainly hasn't won the battle against Tom Holly his kept it close enough Palau Roethlisberger to do his thing with Florida's sucking down applause Ross and that is a first down for the Pittsburgh Steelers well there's really no choice when you have Wallace on your side but to just give them a lot of space we've already seen how you can just run by people and this time it's Brandon Carr and you just go backwards if they want to throw those outs so be it but you're not going to give up one of those 90 yard touchdown pass screams to think Roethlisberger has had in different receivers that's the first finish bought by Wallace to this he has at first out of 10 nobody out in front of him that he's taken down at the 30yard line it's a long way to run around Mac starts on the outside and tabali is figuring that out they had Mendenhall there to help if need it but starts head uncovered and this is truly one of the premier pass rushers in the game second only to the Marcus where a season ago was tomba Holly with sacks sixeight about 3:45 seven a Chardonnay that all comes up about a yard short of the first down to the 35 yard line Roethlisberger tonight over 3,000 yards in this the 11th game of the season this becomes the first Steeler to get there that quickly now you see that little note at the bottom all other Pittsburgh quarterbacks combined have six pieces and so he sort of changed the culture in Pittsburgh no question as we said before 6040 is the Rachel open his war as a first down at the yardline Hines Ward gets free over the middle when they went into that bunch formation the Kansas City secondary starts waving it off you see Javier Arenas number 21 saying we're going zone we're going zonal if you do that I guarantee you Hines Ward is gonna find a hole in the middle of this this time Mac starts need a little help on the inside good pickup by Isaac Redmond my board against poor thread to the 50yard line so for Hines Ward 14th year in the league is that a stellar career should wind up in Canton someday but he's to the point right now or if you looked at a depth chart he's clearly behind Wallace he is definitely behind the Antonio Brown he might be behind Sanders at the moment so he'd be number four or five on the list yeah and he said I can't believe everybody keeps saying that I've lost my speed he said I've never had speed how do you lose something you don't have but when it comes time to make a play as we saw in the Super Bowl last year talk to get those other guys fighting his way for a first half and let's go to Michelle again I talked with Hines Ward before the game al and he acknowledged that his role is changing a little bit but he said I can't control the coach's decisions what I can control is how I play all I can do is stay positive it's not about me it's about this team I just have to be ready these other students said we understand our playoffs start tonight I'm going to do everything I can to help tonight plans couple of weeks and a roethlisberger for bread the Chiefs get a big turnover and Travis Daniels runs it back in his Anna Bassett about the 39 yard line baby city with a man Travis Daniels a corner moved to safety this game did we buy into the look away by Ben Roethlisberger at all on this one you'll see Ben and Travis Daniels one the other way with the interception it was good coverage by flowers on the outside but watch Roethlisberger trying to look off the safety works with most guys but I think the Kansas City Chiefs and their new safety Travis Daniels had seen it before so calcio second NFL star 28 years old won an odyssey for this God but the Steelers know about him because he played his college ball at the University of Pittsburgh and Pitt uses the Steeler facilities and he actually spent some time with Pittsburgh now he's helping his a fullback who on the claim adjust his chin strap pathos the guy calcio when he was at Pittsburgh is there Dave once it comes in replaces the wall Harris is the coach and that created the situation where Joe Flacco said I'm out of here and Flacco goes to Delaware gets drafted number one and taco of course they a free agent as it turned out and play these college ball at Pitt so their training facility is with the Pittsburgh Steelers it's the same facility so they knew all those Steelers guys it was chased out of the pocket and then he was Cristobal under it almost completes it to fall he was chased by Brett Keisel and Italy fourth down to convey time again here this one was good ground what's this throw and then bow I don't know exactly what he was doing but he sort of it was there he just couldn't get his feet down very good your Kansas City so it's like the in Quisenberry as well the lake pretty good which dick is down at the 27yard thirtysix Steelers aerial coverage being brought to you by Geico she looked out upon me Country Club Plaza one of the great shopping centers shopping areas into the country or brightened up for the holiday season first and ten whispers from the 24 pick up six yards he gets to the 30 daily third year as the KC coach and of course the roots go back to Pittsburgh where his father dick was the personnel director former player of the National Football League Haley was five years old sitting in the stands drinking hot chocolate when Franco Harris made the Immaculate reception we asked him the other day did they really catch it the other side second down and four the pudding the first it's kind of interesting and talking to Todd Haley about the whole thing though but Bill Parcells was going to name him scouting director for the entire southeast and pay him a real good salary and that was his background and he said no I want a coach I said you're not gonna be the coach so he went out and tried to hire some other guys no good to get down and finally came back and said you're going to get paid nothing he's gonna coach he said get your head job the Chiefs territory to the 45yard line tackled by Johnson gain of 16 is long for the night boy these blocking tight ends for the Pittsburgh Steelers or something watch them come down here and just control this edge and allow Mendenhall to just run free just outside them they really have seven or eight offensive lineman and on this offense because of the way these we're gonna get a hold ooon match starts offense number 64 10yard penalty repeat first down sold it on litter ski the Gursky moving in to the center position for marquis Pouncy right there you know where the center is I don't have to draw that very good king of obvious sometimes though he kind of grabbed him around the foot a little takedown that's a pretty good call and apologize Mack starts we're trying to put him in there but you know it was the Gursky who stepped up in the I thought he played a really good Baili they get a couple of guys moving for the Pittsburgh Steelers and they've been a little sloppy tonight by the offense there were two men leaving at the same time that did not reset that penalty is declined things have thickened down brings up second to 26 and we go to Michelle again we talked about Marquis pouncing in the first half al and how he had a virus and went to the locker room not feeling well you know he started this I thank you in the show second and 20 Redman with a nice second taking it to the 45yard and that's it's a third down and 11 and 14 of 15 the play of the year this Sprint draw we've seen it in Philadelphia watch him try and run tom hollie by and now go get the next guy down the field it's been working for everybody that time John six defensive backs in or the trees raucous birds are escaping by four one of the problems out at the Kansas City Chiefs have is they really don't have a muhuali change the city offside when he was doing it with 421 left in the third 136 Pittsburgh pittsburg just wasted a timeout because Roethlisberger let him up fourth and four trying to draw Kansas City offside and then if you got a punt what take it I'm not yeah bounce into the image in a city still looking for something offensively by seven January 2nd the initials they cannot sign for the Bridgestone and they chose winter classic the New York Rangers of the Philadelphia Flyers meeting at the hall of the the filly's citizen bank party outdoors the NHL Winter Classic January 2nd on NBC Clark Hunt son of the late Lamar Hunt majordomo on the team watching his club hanging in there but trying to get something going white shirts surrounding the I tailor an earlier pick deflecting it away second down and ten well Steve Breaston can't do this they go down and he runs a hook that he just sits there watch Ike Taylor Drive on it go right by him the timing obviously not there and the only reason it's not intercepted it's because there were too many stealers too for the 2000 a couple of guys to the outside right Preston making the catch up at the 26 yard line will be third down in two and Dick LeBeau has got it going here tonight obviously the Chiefs offensively struggling but remember they lost Troy Polamalu on the first series of the game and so much of the mystery for that magician right there is because of Troy Polamalu and yet they have been their usual sensational self and there's these linebackers really haven't played together as a group for about six weeks now the city's going to go through the Wildcat Xavier awareness we'll take the snap fakes the handoff to McCluster and Dick LeBeau defense has seen every that doesn't work and it's fourth down Lawrence Timmons has played just about every linebacker position this time he's going to duck inside the block of the pulling guard John as a MOA and just too much they're trying to bring a great athlete in Javier Arenas into the game but nothing are you gonna get a snack and a fake and this private saris and he will get the first day so the Kansas City Chiefs Dowagiac don't get it line up and formation with arenas who takes the snap and then he gets it later Todd Haley's there we go we're gonna try whatever we got to do and he sort of tips it a little bit in motion arena's able to convert I'm sure that's one of those sort of checked with Me's depending on the side of Defense but they've gone they needed something from the 34 here's much the cluster our destruction to the Kansas City the same sort of thing Brandon Albert that time shoves Jame Harrison right fast to play on that sprint draw in when the cluster gets a little time to look for the hole two minutes to the end of the third second in the one a cluster again in an inside handle first asked hard to come by but he gets one here to the 45yard line now I think we have to talk about the significance of this game for the Pittsburgh Steelers two losses to the Ravens already and the Ravens held serve against the 49ers over the Thanksgiving Day break and because of those two losses any tag would go to the Ravens in this division right in an easier schedule ahead for Pittsburgh the moment they're in a battle speaking of battle there's Jackie right there at the 45yard line thank you battle one of those he's a big guy he's about 240 pounds but I checked his 40 time and ran a 4/4 aren't many of those human beings on earth and they really like the way that he makes yards after first contact second down and ten unable to come down with it along the sideline okay just missed I'm the jumps and I don't know what happened to dwayne bowe you see they play a room they know we're gonna try and go to their best receiver what's this gate goes too early and if bo it just kept running I think he just wouldn't walked right in the end zone know exactly how he missed out third down and ten look out from behind Moyes is there for the sack fourth down that was much more of a coverage sack than anything else through some worlds who's pulling in for the injured Lamar Woodley on the outside was kept after it but Tyler palco had nowhere to go Dustin Cole quit see faith here floating sake not much distance about uniform and out of bounds at the 29 yard line 31 yard booth something that slipped off off you by Verizon your holiday tablet destination by BMW the ultimate driving machine by State Farm get to a better state and by Bud Light the official beer sponsor of the NFL here we go Bud Light very good with anything from Elsie's barbecue in the city perdition answering screen tailgating for the moment that's brown his crew has been busy giving ben roethlisberger nice job knowing the chiefs and tom hollie had jumped off number 91 he leaves define first sound gain of 21 on the play and I wind the clock now and that's going to take us to the end of the third quarter so the Pittsburgh Steelers sort of dominating but it's a game it's 13 to 603 so the night football back after they're at the freezing mark 32 in changes city tell Michaels Cris Collinsworth Michelle deploy Sunday Night Football 13 6 Pittsburgh and start with a first and 10 for the Steelers at the 50yard line mr. picks up he's carried 13 times 454 yards has been update now in terms of the division races in the AFC North Baltimore already a winner this week Thanksgiving night against San Francisco so Pittsburgh trying to hang with them and go to eight and three in Cincinnati another comefrombehind win now in the West you've got folk Lenore what a job you Jackson has done to beat Chicago today Denver goes to 6 and 5 and there's Kansas City right now and six second entity 48 yards on like Derek Johnson their number one draft choice back in those five at the University of Texas Johnson looked like a running back on this plays he shot the gap sees the guard pulling across areas watch him come right over here and sort of weave his way through to make the stack two guys pulling an Aegis got May's attack Romeo Cornell's beef they're a weenus with the coverage these are a flag down on the offensive backfield by the office number 77 that penalty is declined brings up fourth down rookie right tackle Marcus gillberg and in comes the punk team I tell you what Romeo Crennel is bunched tonight has been nothing short of brilliant against a tremendous offense they had just answered the call time after time but you just get the feeling is going to take a pot return or something for the Chiefs to score and there's ain't got a flag because they run into the kicker they got Jeremy Horn who came through it was thirty ten is it is it running or roughing is the question and obviously that's huge kicking running into the kicking leg is five running into the plant leg is fifteen in a first down so they're gonna ask Tomlin I think it's the five yard variety do you want to kick it again and that's what they're gonna do and there it is it's perfectly explained and obviously by going to Tomlin he wants to know by the defense it's a 5yard penalty not an automatic first down we will repeat fourth down and that will move the ball to the 45yard line so what Tomlin is basically saying is I don't want the touchback I think I can fit them inside the 20yard line it's a good decision and you can see now Todd Haley is beginning to lose faith maybe in his offenses ability to make a play he's trying to make one on special teams fair catch is cold for and that works out very much in Pittsburgh's favor the two to twelve yards so start now from the 813 six Steelers next month NBC bringing back the reality show that started it all all those useless fear factor right here on NBC for me Kansas City and bull is going to be bounds at the 26yard line is where this spot about everybody stopped they thought beau was out of bounds and he just wasn't and that thing almost broke his soul a superhot screen most days and bouncers he does this for pirouette stays inbounds and was very close to breaking them 50 foot water first down this is Jackie battle so that play gains 17 yards and battle takes it out to the 26 yard line second and nine Kansas City has not scored a touchdown on their past 41 drives that have started inside the 20 yard line crazy not al because I like you I'm gonna give you two to one odds that they don't score here really yeah I'm going to do that for not 5 to 2 second down and hey crazier stuff is happening takes it out to the one of the nice things the Kansas City Chiefs have at their disposal blocking wide receivers big guys see the secondary block there on Ryan so a couple of quick screens has been the best play that the Chiefs have really come up with for the most part all night Taco 10 of 17 for 109 yards with two intersections in the pump in the first half Nathan completes it for a short gain to Dwayne Bowe anytime you see James Harrison out playing the slot receiver believe it Brandon Albert that time did it good on Harrison as he came in on the Blitz that's about as long xyler Palko have all night heylia's seen enough of Harrison playing a slot receiver like a Super Bowl second down and five 100 yard return to the 44yard line for the Pittsburgh Steelers you know are they wearing down a little bit here this has been a fastpaced game the Chiefs has pretty much stayed at the line of scrimmage throughout the course of the evening and if they could pick up another first down here who knows third and one on the ground getting the first down it's like the little engine that could right now and Tommy the odds just dropped even money get out of here going nohuddle again rainbow at the end of the line of scrimmage with another big block to pick up that first down 4:46 ratted Jones taking the ball to midfield PETA for second down and six for Kansas City and tell you the old guy in there Casey Whitman I don't know if he's gonna play or not after this season he's been around for a long long time then he is fighting hard now again Steve McClendon seven you know the Pittsburgh Steelers have a way of developing young players Cameron Hayward there on that one it's been Ziggy hood they drafted a couple years ago and now he's a starter Jason world's coming along and Cameron a the latest one they don't you use them for a couple of years but by the time they do they're pretty good number one pick Ohio State third that is sick for the ball the 50yard line and it's for a first down Jonathan versity of pittsburgh along the sideline moving the chains on a third down and six I think this is the play they tried to hit to Steve Breaston and this time execute it perfectly first action and when he's at the 30 inside you but plus brigade's thinking that Jason worlds is right there to stop him at the line of scrimmage you know what you don't see out of the steelers because of this hurry up offense and obviously because troy polamalu is not in there either is all the exotic things you know usually we used to see in football here they're moving around all that this is they're just sort of sitting in the base defense and pathos starting to catch up to the world over the right side inside the 25 tackled by Monday it's gonna set up another third down it'll be third down and two there we go right out gets up on the line again coming down and boy this has been not even close the best Drive of the night for the Chiefs time out aerial coverage brought to you by Geico Arrowhead Stadium where a shot to the head was taken by William gay he goes to the sideline it was immense takes his spot and here's a third and two from the 22 yard line even despite that had he been able to maintain his balance he might have picked up the first bamboo that was Anthony Becht the tight end he ran into and it will be fourth down BEC just going to come across right here and make the tackle when they've got this thing so wide open got picked off coming across there oh my goodness they had it just perfectly setup when battle can't keep his feet and now they're gonna try a field goal from 40 yards why and sucka gotta make it 13 to 9 and with seven eleven remaining in regulation dang it in feelers simply Night Football brought to you by DIRECTV if you call yourself a sports fan you got to get DIRECTV by the W Wendy's new double cheeseburger by Best Buy and Toyota that's the Derrick Thomas Academy opened in the 2001 here in Kansas City none of the late Kansas City linebacker 950 children enrolled there and prekindergarten through when I he was some player some player and some guy all the food guys so many of them out there in our community we're here about those guys here plenty about the others walk to Sanders they did it before farther again this is the way it started before the game of the little skirmish along the sideline get the call from Hockley here I'll tell you the Chiefs special teams units tonight have been top they have set the tone during the return holding by the receiving team number 22 they had Finley from Pittsburgh keeps the ball first down you know let's go back to the Jackie battle play then we'll talk about the decision made by Haley which deserves further examination Brett Keisel is going to get penetration and basically Brandon Albert right here is going to get pushed back in to back the BEC really didn't half to turn the corner Jesus gets out of the way Jackie dad is going to pick up that first down Phoebus penetration that I need to get choice to go for a field goal we're about for Chris where you have it the situation like you have done.i where the offense is doing next to nothing and finally they put together a good Drive and a field goal still put you in a position where you still need a touchdown yeah I think the lead I'm not sure I wouldn't have gone for it there I would have definitely gone for it I agree with you 100% out because you're in a situation where you still have to have a touchdown at this point too again we had the seal of defense out on the field several minutes moving it really are and ended up TV 17 you are though so the way from Derrick Johnson 14:01 Derrick Johnson has just been too athletic for these big offensive lineman of the Pittsburgh Steelers for all these Steelers linemen Marchese bouncy backers of the Chiefs by 40 remaining to grows and that will beat the poi and parses Braun was out of bounds with the officials say inside first down no force out anymore so if this second foot goes out of bounds the play would be out of bounds but it looked like let's see one two did that second foot get down in bounds challengeable does Haley want to haven't reviewed upstairs I saw there Hey Eastern European of Georgia and as usual we're seeing the Steelers with trouble trying to bounce it outside they're even trying to crack back with some of their wide receivers now to try and create some running lanes as beside that time I'm like wow stinking get it done well we came in here talking about the great corners of the Kansas City Chiefs and Brandon Flowers this is as tough of play as there is on a corner that back shoulder throw and yet they have been up to the task in touch them the external 27 ago here comes the Blitz and then has it deflected and complete Ben Roethlisberger gets blitz more than any quarterback in the league 44% of the time and they dial one up here dude the Chiefs in it will be fourth out then you have to say the protection was pretty good on this play he had time to get this fall off but just enough pressure to get the hand up and now I have to say this has been one of the most impressive defensive performances city juice defenses Linda's just a Houston reflected field of the 24 and he takes it to the 30 yard Curtis crowd Sunday Night Football next week to the Bayou we go the Detroit Lions taking on drew Brees and the Saints Stark's in New Orleans at 7:00 Eastern 4:00 Pacific to the 30yard line the Chiefs now on first and 10 to the 31yard we just have to think about Tyler Falco in this situation here's a young man that grew up in the Pittsburgh area he said it's a religion football is in the Pittsburgh area he said I got booed at high school games they know the difference there between food football and Paul how the game should be played a Steelers fan and with a chance to knock off Pittsburgh Steelers to die here knighted for polemic now for Pittsburgh in time the bass is caught by McCluster out to the 36 yard line and here's a third and for these little hot screens on the outside had been the thing that's been working in that time it was the block now you have to wonder is this poor down territory are they back with our three timeouts and it has to be for him banging songs it to say give me the plea cool you're gonna fool it's going to be the first guy try to get out of bound like Taylor makes the tackle but they pick up the first I think that's that bad of the thing that he did get out of bound way they three time estimates but they have plenty of time for this drive and as we we'll know is Todd Haley wells niqo's you don't want to give Ben Roethlisberger too much time at the end of a football game then again if they pick it up in little tiny pieces here we'll turn out for the twominute warning 2:15 bulletins to the 45yard line it'll be a game of three that'll make it second down and seven and that's going to take us to the twominute warning and the Kansas City Chiefs great measure to that defensive Romeo Crennel 13:9 Wendy's postgame report to follow Michelle we'll be down on the field Bob Tony and Mike tore up the game up and we'll take the glance ahead to the Lions and the Saints versus the game it's Sunday night downtown two minutes to go three time offs as Kansas City's dispersion and its second down and six shoulders of speed resting but he was shoveling it he didn't have control and he stepped on the chalk covered by Keenan Lewis and that's gonna make it third down boy it was a great read Lewis got his hand in there too I think the problem was he got his feet down but he bobbled the football going out of bounds right there play nicely thrown ball that didn't that possession starts up a third down and search perfectly by to stop him in his tracks fourth down this has been made such a huge difference for the Chiefs tonight where they get quickly trying to lock them into this coverage process come on snap it and that's a first down at the 47 yard line ability to get up inches may have been the difference there was a huge collision on that play and they still don't take a timeout they've got three fiftyfive seconds and baffle flows and that's been completed I would have taken a timeout William Gay on the corner blitz think it was Anthony Becht who got drilled going down the field and was right there in the middle of that whole pack but somehow beau in here he's on the ground I'm not sure he had the first down there and they gave him full credit for that move and it could have been stopped from the replay booth but it wasn't second down and ten 52 seconds which coming again we want for Harrison but he gets the pass away Buster taking it to the 40 we'll take its first time out that's a good play call by Todd Haley right there you got Dexter McCluster in a position of having to block James Harrison instead they just release him and flip it to him gonna get Harrison coming off the edge and instead of trying to block him just let him release now he's oneonone in the open field and makes something out of it take one more look at the fourth down play was Bo touched down and it looks like he would have had the first down anyway so it didn't matter and that's what they saw upstairs I kept going the ball now at the 40 it's third down and four tasty with two timeouts laughs fear the cluster goes into the swamp that will be Boris been making the catch at the 33 yard line and Kansas City will take time out but before that here's Brandon Albert who is down they have toys are gonna get a 10 second run off here that's exactly right and plus your if if there's any hope of getting Albert back on the field you would have had to have taken the time out anyway right so on two levels number one you don't want the ten second run off number two because they take the time out they could get him back and then get them up and back into the lineup here on the next play watch what they're doing here with the presnap motion and they look at whether or not the defenders move out with them in this case they knew they had man coverage because Lawrence Timmons went out on Dexter McCluster they have been moving the back in the backfield from one side to the other and watching how the Steelers react to that to determine where to throw the football it's been an impressive Drive thus far but they have gone so slowly here al that the clock is becoming a major fact that slowly and again you don't to leave any timeouts on the wall they were forced to take one here 38 seconds is still working an Albert never replace him on the next play looks like Jason whoa its came into in this situation there are if you don't you're going to get about four glitchers to that side against Jared Gaither they threw the six nine three hundred forty pound former Baltimore Raven no longer thing it's going to take him to get loose all night three hours BALCO six enemies at 33 yards they can get up in small bites on this Drive Gator we're gonna sue somebody coming it's earlier than wind up in the back field in the pole five yard penalty first down so the man in the area is and he cost him five worse than 15 Branden Albert's coming back out there again he could have played that snap because of the timeout luckily for them the clock wasn't running or else that would have been the 10second run off though because of the timeout it was not now the ball deep 37 yard line it is legal for number 76 to return to the game after the injury because of the timeout noted at the 37 I'm showing blitz and then he backs off into coverage 13 of the 15 great job by Dick LeBeau that time they show glitch or thinking blitz and then they all drop out as the Kansas City Chiefs leave everybody in the block thinking it's a blitz so you only end up with three guys out in the route nowhere to throw the football palkó just sailed it there was no throw his only choice was to try and throw this and went away and I tell you that's pretty lame right there on the part of dwayne bowe doesn't even stick his hands in the air to try and make an attempt on that ball and Tyler Falco saw that too yep in amongst five white shirts you've got five Steelers coming into the picture here yeah I've seen a lot of lame stuff around the NFL game on the line your sixfoot field wide receiver and you don't even stick your hands in the air because you might get hit in the ribs well that won't be a fairytale finish for the man from the University of Pittsburg Kansas City is going to take their time out anyway here hoping for a pasar check Edwards but don't count on it well and the other thing is a receiver sometimes you just try to tip this football you know just get a hand on it or just get your hands in the way and the other thing Bo did on that play he stuck his hand in the air and I think Tyler palco thought he was going deep we almost could read his lips as he was coming up saying go deep you stuck your hand in the air you gave me the full call and then I end up sailing the football and you don't go for it incredible and the Pittsburgh Steelers come in as big favorites and escape with a 13 design when Romeo Crennel his defense kept him in the game Mike Tomlin watches his team go to 8 and 3 tied with Baltimore for the top spot in the AFC North third the Steelers winners in Kansas City coming up next the Wendy's postgame report after these messages from your local NBC station welcome to the Wendy's postgame report here now Bob Costas well chance the city's defense played more than well enough more than kept them in the game but now over their last forty five possessions covering four games the Kansas City offense has produced exactly one touchdown they shut the Steelers out of the second half but Ben Roethlisberger and company still go to eight and three and Big Ben is down on the field with Michele Tafoya Ben these guys hung around they were tough to put away what were you thinking on their final Drive step up one more time for us defense they did a great job all day disappointing when you don't play the way you want you offensively but you know what you'll take a win and they OC any day so when Keenan Lewis finally made the interception what were you thinking thank goodness you know what just another great play by our defense so what were they able to do Kansas City that gave you so many problems well they're great they're great defense you know they they brought a lot of pressure and just just beat us and we gotta go look at the tape and like I said we're not happy with it but we'll be happy with a win how did your hum hang in there as you played this game you know throughout the night to get worse it still attached so it'll be alright finally you're prepared for Cincinnati now next week and a division rival where do you guys need to improve as you get ready for that game well this is a very physical game so hopefully everyone's alright we get out of it okay and obviously divisional game is gonna be a tough ones will be nicely back home this is a great crowd but we just got to be ready to go Ben thank you thank you alright Michelle thanks to you and to Ben and now we swing things over to New York where Tony Dungy is standing by in the studio your thoughts on this one coach well as you mentioned Bob Romeo Crennel and the Chiefs had a great defensive game plan really held Pittsburgh down but they just didn't have enough offense I know Mike Tomlin is the coach the Steelers he's got to be concerned and knowing they've got to play a lot better next week against Cincinnati who does have the capability to score there may not be thirty two true number one quarterbacks in the league backup quarterbacks are very important the Chiefs are now Owen to with tyler palco as their starter and we saw around the league again this weekend other contending teams having their problems with inexperienced backup quarterbacks yeah when you're a playoff caliber team in this salary cap era one of the questions you have to ask yourself is how much money can we afford to spend on the back of a quarterback when I was at Indianapolis we never did spend a lot on backup quarterbacks and it's kind of coming back to haunt them now we saw that situation with the Bears today Caleb Hanie had to step in for Jay Cutler and he didn't play well he turned the ball over and really kind of derailed a team that was really on on a hot streak on the other hand you saw in Houston where they did invest in Matt liner but he goes down and now they're playing TJ yates and he came in and got them to victory but they're gonna have to go this next stretch with him and it is really really tough knowing how much money to invest in those backup quarterbacks yeah there's Houston at 8 and 3 in pursuit of their first ever playoff spot but now down to their third string guy Tony as ever thank you we'll turn now to Mike Florio pro football TOCOM we'll have all the big news from week 12 tomorrow afternoon on NBC Sports Talk on vs. but for now mike tony mentioned TJ yates in at quarterback for the texans when matt leinart was lost probably for the season what's the latest on the quarterback situation in Houston well Bob the initial indications are indeed that Leinart has a broken collarbone they will try to confirm that tomorrow if it is broken he's done for the year they are going to go with TJ Yates the rookie back him up with Kellen Clemens look for them to sign Brodie coil to be number three on the depth chart and as bad as that may be for the Texans it's a lot worse right now in Philadelphia where the Eagles are in a free fall at four and seven thirty eight to 20 home loss fans were chanting fire Andy in the second half for head coach Andy Reid assistant coaches Jim Washburn Marty mourning leg reporting reportedly arguing on the sidelines receiver DeSean Jackson benched in the fourth quarter mike vick missing two games and Counting with broken ribs and they have to pack it all up and head to seattle on a short week for a thursday night game let's go back for a second Mike to the Houston situation as Dan Patrick noted on football night Brett Favre will probably have to be retired for about five years before his name isn't mentioned any longer so inevitably it's going to be suggested that perhaps the Texans should pick up the phone and contact brett favre what do you say well Peter King spoke to Rick Smith the GM of the Texans earlier tonight and it sounds like they're not interested for now they're not interested in the circus that goes along with having Brett Favre and Peter King also texted with Brett Favre who seems to be not interested in playing so it looks like it really is over maybe yeah probably it really is over yeah 99 percent we never say a hundred percent when the subject is Brett Favre thanks Mike for an NFL Films allaccess look at the critical plays from we 12 including another Tim Tebow gamewinning drive this one in overtime against the Chargers you can watch NFL turningpoint with Dan Patrick Wednesday night on versus in Kansas City the Steelers beat the Chiefs 13 and I Alan Chris are back to wrap things up after this is gone respect is earned by performance you are crazy great this is a cheney the saints next with a matchup this explosive breeze looking for touchdown to Sunday night welcome back to the Wendy's postgame report here now Al Michaels cosworth we're gonna head to next week we don't know about Adamic ensue whether he will be suspended or not or whether we might be appealed we don't know but we do know we're gonna see the Detroit Lions next week for the first time since NBC took over this package in 2006 and they are still very much in the mix of course it's not gonna help of in dama kansui after that whatever that was on the Thanksgiving Day that was pretty lame but we're talking about a football team still very much in the hunt and one of the great players and Calvin Johnson that you're gonna see during the course that year I'm excited about its I think this is a legitimate team Detroit go into the Saints and the Saints just can't shake the Falcons I mean the Falcons at one point about a month ago looked like they were a little bit on the ropes but all of a sudden you know Atlanta hanging right in there and it's up to the Saints to stay in front of them yeah and for the northern Saints they're trying to stay in that hunt they're still have a possibility is it could they end up with one of the buys one of the top seeds you know and so every game is important and now we're down to that fun time of year you know after Thanksgiving it all gets bigger each week as we go and this is a big one next week we have reached December yes and we'll see if Detroit takes on a football I will get things started with so our gang led by scoffs and at night from NBC sports home of Super Bowl 46 thanks you for watching this presentation of the National Football League
