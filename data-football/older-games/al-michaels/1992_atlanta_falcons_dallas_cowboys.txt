============================================================

football and his time to play skyline of Atlanta Georgia which would become a very familiar sight of the 96 summer loved the game's approach and the Georgia Dome a key venue for those games and the home of the Atlanta Falcons is sold out it will be rocking tonight the Dallas Cowboys are in town hello again everyone I'm Frank Cappello now Michaels and Dan Dierdorf as we close out the 15th week of NFL play we're delighted you are with us two Falcons and the Cowboys for the Falcons it's a showup game we'll play for pride and perhaps next year but for Dallas just the opposite they can do what they couldn't do last week against Washington they could win their first Eastern Division with the NFC since 1985 that would guarantee them a week off before the playoffs begin for them and they will have that first playoff game at home a truly remarkable turnaround by this team by this franchise one in 15 in 1989 they went to 7 &amp; 9 last year they were 11 to 5 and al if they can win tonight and beat Chicago at home next week they could be a 13 and 3 team that's a truly great story and Frank the blueprint for success has been quite simple Jerry Jones bought the team in 89 hired his longtime friend Jimmie Johnson and no one comes between them no general manager no personnel director no chief financial officer no mucketymuck emeritus it's Jerry and Jimmy and they make all of the decisions they have drafted brilliantly they have traded brilliantly they have deployed personnel brilliantly right now they're among the elite teams in the league and they're young so they could be up there for a long time to come but because they're young tonight's game is important last week an agonizing loss they had the Redskins in the coffin and let them get up and Washington won the game and tonight then they faced a team in Atlanta that has really nothing to gain and nothing to lose and the team like that can be very dangerous and when you only win a half a dozen games it's mucketymuck as well Allen here in Atlanta because it has been such a difficult season they've been wracked with injuries they lose their number one quarterback and Chris Miller but things are looking up for the Atlanta Falcons last week Wade Wilson making his first start for this franchise throws five touchdown passes against Tampa Bay defensively they've only given up one offensive touchdown in the last 14 quarters so that's good defensive play and of course any time Deion Sanders is on the field he has the possibilities of taking any one of the kick spec for a touchdown and every time Troy Aikman puts the ball in the air he knows that dion is roaming back there and he can make all 11 guys miss win or lose the Falcons are always fun to watch and the Falcons will put the ball in the air so we'll wait to see Sanders as Laura Johnson will pick off Clayton Holmes who killed in the league but he runs smack into a black shirt number 38 for the Atlanta Falcons Keith Jones and Jones pays the price as he comes up cradling his left wrist for the Dallas Cowboys Troy Aikman really coming into his own fourth season number one pick in the entire league and 89 at a UCLA Smith and Johnston the running backs Justin the blocker urban and Harper great wide outs Novacek a terrific fight and music and Eric Williams big Eric Williams offensive wine Emmitt Smith 14 out to the 32 yard line but let's see about the flag which was thrown at the 19 yard line the referee tonight is Larry Nemours and that one's going to come back good quartet of linebackers chipping Solomon is a former cowboy Tuggle makes a lot of tackles and Connor on the outside Makai are the longtime 49er and Dolphin with Sanders safety secondary doing its job Rose it away Alvin Barbara coming back for the line of scrimmage the past isn't completed will be second and 15 second and 15 for the Dallas Cowboys 11 and 3 on the year here tonight and then boom that close out the regular season next Sunday against Chicago most of his yardage they run them between the tackles a lot jesse solomon makes the hit after a gain of close to 5 it'll be third and 10 now we didn't have a chance to discuss the many injuries of this defensive unit for the Atlanta Falcons but they have people plan in all kinds of different positions tonight there is Smith being taken there by Jesse Solomon and Jesse Tuggle but they have lost three defense key defensive lineman over the course of the season they are small up front they are inexperienced and Dallas certainly should be able exploit them on the ground threewide an apron steps up and the catch is made by Novacek there's a flag down at the line of scrimmage Novacek is close to what would be a first down but a marker back at the 18 yard line and again it's against Dallas for their side yard penalty the games opening drive 13 Falcon school Blitzen here they come in it's a run and its image Smith who gets out to the considerably short of the first man Darien Connor gets pregnant to the tackle and the Dallas Cowboys would be forced to punt Connor having a good year for Atlanta he has seven sacks six of them in the last game last seven games but Atlanta going with three down linemen and 6 DBS in there a nickel defense well Dallas Frank is making a tough one themselves they're not only playing Atlanta but they're playing themselves with two penalties on the opening drive that's that is exactly the wrong way that a coach like Jimmie Johnson wants to see his club start when they are favored Mike's action to kick Tony Smith back to get it good fun great punt 56 yards taken at the 24 yard line and Smith returns it six to the 30 the tackle is made by Mickey Pruitt so let's take a look now at the Falcons and again as you look at Wade Wilson keep in mind that Chris Miller went to the Pro Bowl for them as their quarterback last year heard in midseason they went with Billy Joe Tolliver and now the longtime Viking Wilson coming off a five touchdown performance they start with Steve Broussard in the backfield with a four wideouts rising Hill Prichard and Haynes and from time to time beyond Sanders then you've got can Hoover Dukes Fralick and Hinton a very experienced but banged up offensive line first and 10 Atlanta at the 31 Wilson right to the air he loses Norton dislodged it and Thomas Everett picked it up well from up here it certainly looked like he took a couple of steps with the ball which establishes possession I think Atlanta might have been arguing that he was down when the ball came out there's no question they're arguing that I think first of all is beyond question there was a completed pass I think where Atlanta is questioning it let's watch it right from left to right there's the catch he has possession oh and the ball comes out when he is on the ground that used to this sort of stuff at the 35yard except this one works in their favor and this is Darien Connor making sure that Emmitt Smith has no place to run they are striking team a pushing team a gambling team everybody knows that but their team of five second and 12 brand enhancement they've been facing a fourman rush and swings want to smith who escapes to falcons and then gets tackled by a trio including solomon and scott cason company Emmitt Smith is a guy who of course not only carries the ball so much but as you can see in his last four games prior to this one twenty nine receptions over seven per game and nobody in the league over the last four games has caught more and why not throw it to him look who he makes miss he makes tippin's miss he makes Tuggle miss I mean right here Emmitt Smith is dead in the water whoa well there's one miss here comes another one right there and he turns it into positive yardage might make the guys a bigger part of my passing game as well like I wouldn't be upset if he handled the ball on every play third and 11 the crowd of course is still booing what they felt was a bad call Willie eggs all over the joint Williams and Argo play no play at all the play whistled dead Eric Williams the right tackle started out of there again third and 16 at the 41 only a threeman one and it's dumped over the middle this is Calvin Martin who takes the ball of the 29 yard line short of the first down and so we're looking at about a 48yard field goal attempt Bruce Pickens was in on the tackle Lin Elliott is a rookie kicker who got off to a terrible start and was probably a kick or two away from being cut and then he reeled off 13 in a row two of those from 53 yards to out so he's well within range backtoback 53 yard is he kicked Steve Beuerlein will hold it will be an official 47 yard attempt and live Elliot so after the questionable fall on the fumble damage takes over can't move but they're close enough for three in the nine 31 remaining in the opening quarter the cowboy takes the early days but this one will be won back to the 27 yard line 23 yard return and Atlanta will start from that spot you know I posed the question before about a player the defensive player being on the ground and the offensive player on top of him he is not really part of the ground and checking with Gerry seaman the director of officials for the National Football League the player can roll off so that ball was still alive unless his knee had already touched if his knee had touched on that prior play which was inconclusive to us or really know that he touched out the knee was down I mean so quickly I mean I you can see what the official saw with the benefit of slow motion we could see that the knee was down here is through side let's take another look at the plate if the knee is down that's the key we couldn't see the football right that's what's the wild card in that state exactly if the official head ruled otherwise it would have been because the football was out of you and thereby Diddy at possession would have been a question second and seven at the 30 yard line this is Drew Hill making the catch and drew Hill and his 13th year has enough for the fresh let's take a look at the Cowboys it'll be a basic four one six two nine Coburn casillas Maryland and Haley up front Norton will be the sole linebacker and because the Falcons invariably line up with the four wideouts 6db Smith the rookie with brown Gant Woodson another rookie and Everett and a Washington it's it's so unusual that the Cowboys have a middle linebacker or a rookie by the name of Robert Jones having a good year and they don't need him tonight so he's an active he's in street clothes you know they played Norton in there because he's good against the pass Norton is not good well it's certainly not as good as Robert Jones is against to run Norton is a good football player but he is not a real run defensive player he is in there also to help out against the pass and there is number one draft pick out of East Carolina having a superb rookie season but you don't need him well he's the same place that every other middle linebacker and every other team in the league is when they play Atlanta there's Chris Miller Atlanta's injured quarterback the Pro Bowl player and he will be back next year he's progressing nicely but without Chris Miller this offense suffers and I know Wade Wilson provided a big spark last year but Chris Miller is the engine that drives this offensive machine here in Atlanta with the five TDs last week but Wade Wilson also is a former probowl quarterback up to Minnesota 1988 first and ten at the 37 yard line Wilson throws complete that's Michael means making his first catch of the night second down and six Wade Wilson has started the game three for three unusual formation there with Hill lining up as a tailback but that doesn't fool anybody in particular Tony Casillas is right there to take care of Steve Broussard and to see us coming back to Atlanta where he had a fallingout you might say with Jerry Glanville and the folks it was definitely a clash of personalities and when Casillas ended up in Dallas he had a great many negative things to say about about Glanville and and I think you can see the emotion that Tony Casillas brought to this game tonight then there have been lots of personality clashes before Jerry Glanville is not the only coach that's had a problem with a player and vice versa they had one these out Leon let comes in its third and six at the 41yard line 47yard game first hitting Pritchard who takes it to the six yard line he is stopped there by jeans and it'll be sucking down in for with under six minutes to go in the opening quarter and the Cowboys up three nothing second and four at the 6 yard line sent to the left that's some sort of a blow by the cowboy secondary B yeah true he'll totally unaccounted for by by the Cowboys you can see Washington number 37 got in there in a taste position but far too late Johnson's extra point is good you heard the phrase in a perfect world low wage world is a perfect world he's 6 for 6 with it even remaining in the first quarter at the Georgia Dome in downtown Atlanta was capacity crowd looking on their Falcons lead 7 to 3 Johnson the whore who's been having stop that the 19 in a 17yard run back in tippin's is there for the tackle and that's where Timmy Johnson at the half egman throws underneath this is Novacek who leads the league in catches for tight ends Jesse Solomon makes the hit and that's Nova checks 60 first catch of the season Falcons meanwhile go 73 yards and 7 plays and Wilson on that drive a perfect 5 for 5 Novacek such a key part of this Dallas offense last year fifty nine receptions a year before that 59 not all that bake he doesn't give you a whole lot of blocking support but you can use him just like a wide receiver you can't cover him with a linebacker and live with it on second and three at the 33 yard line Tiffin's and Donaldson converge on the tackle we talked about a league MVP at Steve Young could be the league MVP Thurman Thomas every year could be what about a guy like Emmitt Smith when you talk about value value to a team is there any man more valuable to his team than number 22 and white well when you look at at what percentage of their offensive running attack oh and you can see that tumble that ball comes out before Emmitt Smith the ground he covered it up Donaldson is the guy who helped the strip in the urban in Atlanta territory and he's wrestled down at the Falcon 45 by Sanders in case we go back on what you're talking about with Emmitt Smith pal I mean I think this year they have improved their running attack to some degree kerbin Richard says a hundred and forty nine yards and Daryl Johnson has 61 but that guy is everything else there's a good look at it last year he was 91 percent of their rushing yardage this year it's a little over 80 but it's the durability that it brings to the table his sure handedness is now blossoming as xever its that he's overshadowed in the recession arish meant getting close to ten bullet nineandahalf and make it second as short at the Atlanta 36 yard line he can make secondary a good tackling remember the second Earl it's so silly out there that time Scott case had him lined up Scott case a former Pro Bowl safety man and he just duck Scott kaseman battle at the top of it it sounds strange to use a word like overshadow to with Emmett Smith but he's so quiet he is he's he's almost behind the scenes as a as far as outspokenness especially on a team with guys like Urban sucks it back he does so brilliantly and so often it picks up the first down a gain of five to the 31 stop by toggling to twentyeight remaining in the opening quarter 73 Atlanta about Smith he gets better as the game progresses like a lot of great running back gee fridge is almost cliche now but you go back to his Emmitt Smith in high school in Florida he gained over eighty eight hundred yards rushing then off to Florida where he gained almost 4,000 yards rushing this is a guy that's carried the football hundreds and hundreds of times and he always shows up to the twentyeighth he's so important that even though Jimmy Johnson would downplay clearly Johnson's worst nightmare would be an injury damage trip going into post season even though curb enrichers as Jimmy said is a pretty good running back and there's the guy who would fill the load and I asked Johnson last night would you have to change the offense a lot he for the moment said no I wouldn't nobody sweated a lot when he said it all he said now would be a problem Irvin Richards would step right in there I think what he feels is that his offensive line has come along so well this year this is the same offensive line step now ski at center and that makes him better than that we saw the very beginning of the season they've been together all year second and seven at the 28 14 by Alvin Harper they first down he's tackled by Tenma Kyra 14 yard game you talk about Emmett Smith that is important to this team let me pose a hypothetical question is it a better team with Troy Aikman at quarterback and kerbin Richards running the ball or is it a better team with Steve Beuerlein at quarterback and Emmitt Smith running the football you know when you talk about who's more valuable to the team Aikman or Emmitt Smith it's an interesting question you know it's always the automatic answer is the quarterback is your most valuable guy on I'm not 100% sure that's the case here now her line went five game play off guys awful good there's a lot of for being so young there's remarkable depth tackled by a gaggle of black shirts oliver barnett and jesse solomon leading the charge and their figures to be the final play of the first quarter unless the second period will commence at the 15yard line of the Atlanta Falcons and in the first quarter the score is Atlanta 7 Dallas 3 will return with Monday Night Football after this message North Moore ABC station Georgia Dome in Atlanta monday night football al michaels Frank Gifford Dan Dierdorf Atlanta leading 7 to 3 in a second and 11 for the Cowboys yard line it's a very short game it's into the arms of urban and tippin's makes the tackle that's one of the few catches Irvin has made this season that's not resulted in the first down as we look at the numbers through the first 15 minutes of playing a dead even in yardage at 87 Dallas has had the ball most of this quarter if you look all the way down to the bottom but the one turnover belongs to the Atlanta Falcons on their very first offensive play of the game and that resulted in a Dallas field goal so and the only Dallas point so far in this ball game but they appear to be about to change that that allows him to get in as well this is a Dallas Cowboy team that really does play a team concept their receivers block for each other downfield they block for their tight end and a wellexecuted pass played results in a Dallas touchdown Martin comes all the way from the left side and no way that Pickens is going to stay with him there's the block that Dan alluded to Michael Irvin is more than just a receiving wide receiver he screened off dion sanders to allow the touchdown by Calvin Martin this is Lynn Elliot on abberline that was up by three Aikman on the drive was a perfect five four five why he scores his third touchdown of the season Dallas three assumes the lead and now it's time for a regular feature on what's new in the world of sports science and technology interceptions and he stands here at the three yard line where they do accept Eliot stick with 1407 to go in the half and the Cowboys on top in the NFC it's an angle to the nearly couldn't get to the other side of the field as the Cowboys did a pretty good job of wool and off the route to the right and they sent him right to the sidelines and he's run out of bounds by Clayton Homes a perfect kickoff boxing a dangerous return man into the corner he has nowhere to go gold upon them BYU against Kansas I hope you're all home on Christmas Day there's Deion Sanders in the game so they run Sanders they've been using them as a wideout or in the slot take your pick from time to time this season including a touchdown reception last week but this time they run them and it doesn't fool anybody and Russell can tell everybody I made an open field tackle on Deion Sanders and didn't have any help Maryland is just penetrating upfield and on the first rush of his NFL career neon Deon goes nowhere number one meets number one so Dion's a career rushing average as his first rush ever is minus four against Florida State second Sexy's Masek for seven biggest richard campbell nine well you hate the waste standing that long in the pocket and come up with an incompletion tremendous offensive line play by the falcons four men came from the cowboys front line and didn't even get close to wade wilson even he just stands and stands and stands he order looked all there it is right there it was hit right at the end looked at me like Darren Woodson got a hand on the ball good play Woodson Nixon getting a lot more time in that secondary third and 14 Green Man doesn't shot the pants is underneath its complete but the for minimal yardage Dru Hill makes the tackle and that'll create a punt and Darren Woodson makes the tackle once again ABC's Monday Night Football is being brought to you by Jeep and eagle a division of the Chrysler Corporation and a good look there at the great Mike Ken walking off the field 15 years he's played left tackle for the Atlanta Falcons and plans and on coming back for number 16 where the fine offensive tackles of the last couple of decades full Haigh to kick Cole hey Sheldon Martin's to receive it line drive six good additions and the run back by Martin flag down to the 42yard one at a 48 yard punt he ran it back nine and a marker down Martin the man who scored that touchdown and it's the old block in the back this is a recording can we go block in the back on the return team number 47 10 yards who spot of the foul first down Clayton Homes you know the order what to think about reads of finding that rule you see that happen so often what are you gonna do let the block people at the back yeah yeah sure Dallas Cowboys defensive unit secondary going over there performance on the far side as the offense takes over at the 29 yard line well tend to go in the half Dallas up 53 apron he has pushed that about by Dion Sanders in frustration it's a 14yard game we mentioned before almost every time Michael Irvin catches a pass it's good for a first down coming into the game he caught 67 this season and 64 of them had been four first downs but again Sanders would need that good you're going to get a lot of manforman assignments you're going to draw the tough receivers and he was out there on an island all alone and that time Irving was the winner that look urban just riding in downfield breaking it back here's Smith and he turns nothing into something up to the 46 you know Emmitt Smith was the league's leading rusher last year he's in the battle again this year with with Barry Foster however there is a caveat here because if you are the NFL rushing leader if you push that stone to the Gators the Knoll rushing leader has ever advanced to the Super Bowl and now there is his team everybody says you have to run the ball to winning this one runs at the best Big Show second down and seven Earvin making the cash and they stopped them short of the first time so it's funny every time you bring something up about a guy doing something so often catching balls and almost always getting a first down he catches a couple in one game that don't result in it chuckle makes the hit well a lot of Michael Irvin's receptions are shorter passes like that because there's so much in love with the way he runs with it after he makes the catch runner too and he's also big he comes into the game with a an eighteen point eight yard per reception average and and there currently is 18 for but a lot of those are seven eight nine yard passes that that heat tax on a 10 yard run after and there's your long three and then something Novacek he takes it to the 41 yard line that's a gain of nine Gardner makes the tackle and with ten minutes to go in the half first down Dallas and they lead 10 7 you're never going to cover a Novacek with a defensive and dropping off the line of scrimmage Novacek just picked up the 4 or 5 yards he knew was good enough for a first down fake been dropped back didn't even look for another receiver and popped him but again a Lana being forced to play their remaining athletes because they have so many that are damaged particularly defensively in out of positions areas that's a trifecta that's his third penalty of the game they'll start 79 offense prior to snap five yards still first down well earlier this season they gave him an honor they almost never give to an offensive lineman they named him the offensive player of the week in the NFC one week we repeat a the best look therapist was Jay Novacek jumping out of the way Williams goes offsides two big guys lock up a Novacek he doesn't want to get his feet stepped on he just tap dances out of the way pretty big on bookends and Rob Williams is 320 and one up open the other side to an angle is about 300 what a fine young firstly 15h men who has completed and you can see the side judge he almost twitch looked like he thinking about throwing a flag case in frustration tosses Novacek though he just couldn't get him down see how quick NOAA tech is getting downfield though just like a wide receiver they use him in motion bring him down he drives case the free safety good man for man defender and he just races away from case looking like a wide receiver welldesigned play and that's a who's that inside the 15 now that comes away you're not allowed to do Jay Novacek you are allowed to put out the stip are but you can't put it on the opponent's face 34 yard gain no Dean Smith of the second and 10 at the 13 yard line and we'll have another look with 8:20 to go in the half you can stiffarm the guy that's trying to tackle you but you can't do it to the face and that is why Scott case got a little upset that's that's one that no but check got away with and then case got away with one at the end so I guess it's it all evened out might be something you're not going to do but if you just do it casually and flip it across there and it happens to happen you'll sell them get a flag for it there's no 10 yard line and that will set up a third down and seven risky tackle there by neon Dion that's a it's really throwing a block more than it is wrapping up and making the tackle the risk is if he misses Novacek Jay goes on into the end zone he throws himself across and actually with an ankle trips Novacek a an unorthodox tackling technique to say the least that Ben Irvin he would have been in the end zone little hurdle included on I agree is going to take a timeout Michael urban yelling is trying I'm sure it wasn't that's something that eight men had done I think Michael Irvin saw some weakness in the Atlanta defense and was hoping they could get to playoffs perceptions on third down only Sterling Sharpe of Green Bay with more coming into the week and he's already lost four balls tonight seven at the 10yard line well straight makes it 13 it's urban but urban push back and his forward progress I don't believe has a first down I'm gonna put it at the floor and it's going to set up a fourth and one and Lin Elliott and the gang are coming in early for that very short but Jimmy Johnson doesn't even hesitate you're up seven to three with the field goal unit out there it's ten up there that's good aggressiveness Frank by the Falcons they had three guys make the hit on urban all at once and that that's what kept him from getting the first down yardage enforces a field goal good hustle spur line will spot it of the 12 it's a 22 yard attempt for Lin Elliott to try to put Dallas up no problem Elliott boots a throw Eggman's completed 13 in secondfastest 6:14 to the ham 13 7 then I get to put it in the air Deion Sanders waiting for it and again it's a beautiful fit the floor he pins them in the corner and Sanders comes out to the 27 it's still a pretty good run back but when you got beyond on the other end you'll take a 23 yard return Agee makes the tackle that's all he could do with it that's like having a gate just swinging the hinge being on the sideline nearest to where Deion was and just closes on a good coverage by Dallas and Deion did all he could do with it hmm Dallas has had the ball almost two three times as much as the Falcon to this point in the game hard to kick that over there right footed kicker too ordinarily you could kick it further and more accurately and hooking it to the left hook into the face mask of one Charles Haley the X 49 I came over at the beginning of the season to help the pass rush is Bruce a man facemask on James Washington two flags actually came in one from an official on the side and then one deep out of the secondary well we've got a good Glanville said how can we have that very numerous is the referee track back number 35 offensive team will go half the distance to the goal repeat first down prettier Richard set out to the right just cracked back right in full view of the official and he didn't even complain about it in full view of two effects I'm sorry at the 13 yard line now so that negates what would have been the best run of the night Wade Wilson the longtime Viking Wilson went to Minnesota during the offseason he said I would have gone home to Dallas I thought I had a job there they released me just before training camp went home for two days Atlanta called and that's how he wound up here Blue Hill and Hill is taken down by Larry Brown up at the 23yard line wonderful receiver do hills been over the years starting with the Rams and down to Houston over for 580 receptions and still going strong at 13 years of the league he's had his best years as since turning 30 he's made far more catches in the in the decade since he's turned 30 then when he was in his 20s used to play with the Rams in fact he was with the Rams so long ago he played in a Super Bowl when the Rams play Pittsburgh in 79 hoping they're going to shoot the 33yard line wave Wilson a Texan went to East Texas State makes this home now near Dallas Georgia Dome of course as you look around in its first year and this facility will host the Super Bowl next January the suit this coming Super Bowl to Pasadena and then the one following the 93 season right here and then of course will be put into use for a variety of events during the Olympics which will be here in Atlanta in 1996 so this venue will be getting a lot of highprofile exposure over the next couple of years Richard was there and the official came over and said nope sure was a nice catch artistically it sure was he gets nine point nine on style points but the zero point zero and that it doesn't count need another pinkie down he comes down with one foot as you're left all right the right actually wasn't even close but still a sensational effort by Mike Prichard and cap it talked so much about Deion Sanders being such a great return man Calvin Martin is just about as dangerous you ready to find in this league today he is so quick back there well the difference between the two is it Martin those both kickoff returns and punts Martin's run to punch back for touchdown at 51 yards to the 16 and a four yard run back by Martin to the 20 and Martin box in just like Sanders has been on the kickoff we put him down there and you just swing the gate and the coverage closed on him bull Hank says I'm not the only kicker in this stadium that can pin it right up against the sidelines Elliot's been doing a good job with the Dallas kick off since vice versa at the 21yard line Cowboys have it 3:45 remaining in the opening hands Atlanta's defense has not done much to stop the cowboy offense from knocking off some big chunks of yardage ever since their opening drive so a good opportunity for them his next pass shall tie the team record he throws it out of the reach of michael irvin that's only a second incomplete pass of the game his first pass was incomplete and this thing leads that inside well it wouldn't be six points because Deion Sanders would have probably run Ervin down as he with just about anyone but that there's no inside help for Sanders and that ball just overthrown take a look at her but he just goes right by Sanders I hope Deion wasn't telling I mean hey I had you all the way well if he leads it inside instead of overthrowing it if six points so we're very close there's been Santa's little Cody that's Mike and we'll get back to him in a minute standing on the Falcon sideline five my can is their eightyear defensive end from Notre Dame who within the last month was diagnosed with testicular cancer had surgery is in the process right now of receiving radiation but talking to him down on the field before the game really asked that I tell everybody his friends that he's doing well that his prognosis is excellent and he fully plans on being back next year playing defensive line for the Atlanta Falcons he's feeling better the radiation is mating nauseas but but he's doing well we all wish you well way to the 38yard line of the falcon we talked about the seven and eight yard in many ways like an Andre readin in Buffalo the guy who who isn't afraid to work the middle and make people who either miss him or in this case bounce off of him this is Michael urban using his size wrapped up held by Dion tackled by Dion and the hunt gets up looking like why is it this guy on the ground that's that is the athletic ability and the allaround skill of Michael Irvin and straight off when outside for use where he is six to about 200 pounds and nothing Sanders could do 220 to go in the half at the 23yard line Chuck Smith is saying that March step nasty the center got out there and hit him in the back either step now ski or jisuk I'm not sure which one it was there's 53 and 63 that's a good call against the Atlanta Falcons always is a lot of teams use reverses against them there's such a pursuing attack defense it's be 663 comes out and there he was city hits he hits Chuck Smith in the back but that was kind of a deceiving angle Smith was actually down on the ground and underneath receiving twominute warning two minutes to go in the half Cowboys have the ball leap by six they picked the 53 yards through Atlanta's 8 on the ground and about dhinam almost 2 to 1 on the air I think it's very key for Dallas to be able to control the rushing of Atlanta coming into the night because they're playing it straight for down line with Kenny Norton in the middle and they are shopping the running game of the ladder and here is Emmitt Smith second and six Troy Aikman who's been almost perfect tonight we mentioned he came within one of establishing we're tying the Dallas team record for most consecutive completions not held by Meredith not held by Starr back not held by white not even held by Clint Longley the record is held by Steve eluard yeah maybe there's something that Don Meredith owes an old baby held at once sipping on it right now second and five let's see about the flag back to the line of scrimmage that linesmen made the call and I'm not even sure nobody had control of it is against defense a 21 on the outside coverage lined up offside trying to get into the face of urban and lined up offside you don't see that very often Glanville looking up at the replay right here's Novacek and his dive for the endzone if from that angle looks like he didn't have control of the football when it came across the goal line sometimes yeah as if the ball was separated from his body Elliot's extra point is good Novacek has made five catches in the first half and remember he had both cowboy touchdowns last week in the loss to Washington ball just has to break the plane to toe from that angle too I'm sure we got a couple more Novacek again with such quickness and he he definitely loses control of the football question be was it before or after he crosses the goal line the only thing we can say is that the side judge is right there at least pulling on the arm well sooner or later they figured to get in even if they said he was down at the twoinch line Dallas is terrific on first and goal in Atlanta stinks on first and goal on defense what are they 81% getting into the endzone from inside the 10yard line well the difference being there if they ruled it a fumble out in the field of play and it goes on through the end zone and out of the end zone it's a touch back yep that's that's what Atlanta certainly could have used I sucked me into buying my replay in theory midnight replay okay we were just analyzing the play on the field let's get into the holiday spirit I don't think the ants thinkin about it seven yards deep but he took a look at a few white shirts out there and figured well benefit her to bring it down to the 20 Lin Elliott hung that one up there deep into the endzone and saboteurs made the right move it's okay to take a line drive that deep in the end zone try and bring it out but little or no chance for Sanders even as good as he is running him back because again he was pinned over against the left sideline in June Jones I fix a coordinator for Atlanta and of course the major proponent of the runandshoot red guns whatever you want to call it spread offensive when it's working is beautiful to behold when it isn't it's embarrassing first and ten Falcons of the twenty they have all of their timeouts Wilson leads them to the line out of the comfort as me that's again is sick oh sorry takes it out of bounds of the 26 and it stops the clock at 1:10 for a reminder at half time Jimmie Johnson another tremendous year coach of the year last year he could be again this year and they'll have a lot of competition from some rookie head men and then we'll talk to George Seifert we have Detroit against San Francisco next week we'll find out from the 49 a coach if Montana will play how much Montana will play if he does next week at Candlestick Park I'm sorry stepped out of bounds at the 32 in 104 left you might wonder why purse art is so open the Atlanta Falcons seldom very rarely throw to their running backs coming out of the backfield obviously they had the four wide receivers ordinarily in the game but they seldom used their backs out of the backfield last two plays Broussard is wide open all in frequencies they break the frequency down and throw it into the computer spit it out on Wednesday give it to the defense and what that has told Dallas very seldom will they hit the sea back to the back John Dryden who's been pretty much blanketed tonight and has been quiet on the receiving end I don't think he ever does it andre has been blanked and that is very unusual when you consider that coming into the game his receptions matched the number on his jersey somebody was speculated Dan that you found an interesting that Dallas has the number one defense in the NFL through the 14 game then they might not have anyone going to the Pro Bowl unless he puts together like part of that is because of their age part of that is because Haley who has been a pro ballplayer before but it's played out sideline territory why they once that is the defensive coordinator 50 seconds remaining and a timeout is taken here number one by Atlanta you know really the only guy with any Pro Bowl experience to speak of is it is Haley but he was always been going as a linebacker and here he is a defensive end and in the competition a defensive end formidable in the NFC good look at him working against Ken working against Broussard who gets in his way and Charles Haley is had I guess by statistical standards of his past had a disappointing year only four sacks coming into tonight's game be interesting to see what his longterm future will be with the Cowboys they came to Dallas with only a oneyear contract he's in that class of potential free agents I still think you play in the NFC East a lot of good football teams you meet week in and week out and with the number one defensive team and you don't have any great star ideas real tribute to a team defense today wants it they're second with 43 checks left 21yard pickup Dallas in there are six defensive backs hard to find an area that open that deep downfield and well thrown Michael Haynes good concentration gets the reception and the first down at the 27 so it landed now with one timeout left and they are very close well they're in field goal range for norm Johnson is having a terrific season but the Jerry Glanville thinking about seven right now it would be a lot better than 322 seven is the score one different kind of cat right there Johnson the field goal kicker the 27 first and time 21 by Pritchard rolled to the turf at the 18 second does not take a timeout here Wilson and such saves that last time out now you got a third and one coming up she got obviously time to run another play and then if he can convert another play after that depending depending depending how long what type of a play how long it takes them to uncover of course keep in mind they'll get no cooperation from the Dallas Cowboys in in getting their players back up and back to the huddle or back to the line of scrimmage he'll intentionally cover them up delay as long as they can they're they're getting up right I think you got a little arising down here he's shut out this bar but he is so tough one a couple big play to get to that stripe and save that final timeout and Kenny Gant was the defensive back on Prichard and and he wrapped him up and made sure he didn't get away from him and he doesn't know how close he is to the sidelines and it really doesn't make an effort to keep Prichard from going out of bounds nor should he he's he's intent upon making the tackle that was a smart play by Mike Pritchard first and goal sixteen seconds left Wilson to throw up a duck charging in and might have gotten a piece of it certainly got a piece of Wilson that used four seconds 12 ticks left that was not a very well disguised blitz you would have thought that Atlanta Frank might have been in a better position to handle it Woodson brakes a bit early Broussard did get in there to get to his feet but Wade well Allah to describe that ball what was it when you shoot down this would be a different cycle then they also the timeout second and goal but couldn't hold on and hang it down to six seconds I don't think you had to go to the end zone you could have just look how much time that you could have thrown one short 12 seconds is enough time to run a play and stop it with a timeout watch it a bit fun but if you do that day and you don't get into the end zone then you're saying to yourself oh wait a second let's kick the field goal here you know if you leave yourself but let's say four seconds if you don't try to go oh wow sure but I mean you could run it into the end zone after you catch it as my point in any event they they go for it in one play don't make it have to settle for what they hope is three 27yard eccentric Johnston and that's good two seconds remaining and they there was two seconds left in there somehow the timekeeper didn't press the button and there go those two seconds and they Lena bill is saying where'd those two seconds go but he actually he doesn't need those two seconds considering you have to take off with them yep in any event they get there yeah it's not just a commitment it's not just the work I really enjoy football I enjoy coaching players I enjoy the relationship with players I enjoy the relationship with coaches and so I'm doing what I want to do and that's the biggest thing and and the other thing is other people try to look at my life and see well but that could change with this guy in one kickoff return you know I figure that was so good he gets a lot of practice you have the last ring defensive team in the national football here's a bouncing pick and that's taken at the nine Piedra who last year at the end of the season was their number one running back and now he's a special team where he takes it to the 26 and Clayton Homes makes the tackle well we haven't seen very many incomplete passes tonight in fact we talked about the consecutive passes each had a real long streak in the first half eight men wound up completing 15 of 17 wilson 14 of 20 so for the game the two of them combined 78.4% and that's not far away from the alltime record of 82.1% in one game Steve Bartowski on the Atlanta end and Joe Montana on the san francisco end and Gooding white shoes Johnson was the beat Jackie Broussard on the ground and he picks to that to the 30yard line that's a game before he's tackled by Tony Casillas look at Aiken you know Casillas made that last tackle we're visiting with Tony Casillas came over from Atlanta we talked about his problems with Glanville he's a horse owner he has a horse he has a thoroughbred by the name of Harry and Jerry when he liked land bill he named part of the horse after Glanville and then of course says he says it now as he tells the story he says guess which part of the horse is named that the jury second and six catches me by Prichard knowing Jerry Glanville I I doubt that causes him a great deal of another vodka see as though I mean remember we were talking to Jimmy Johnson about Casillas he said he remembered recruiting him when he was an Oklahoma State notice the title go there but I mean he did recruit him he said he knew is a good kid so they wouldn't have made the deal notice the time of possession here that's exactly what the score is 22 tenpoint per minute I can't recall ever having seen it to work out that precisely well maybe it just looks good that way that's a point a minute and the Dallas Cowboys appear to have recovered and they Kenneth Gantt is the guy who stripped the football from Steve Broussard and at the bottom of the pile to give possession to the Cowboys is Larry Brown boy it just hopped right to brown there were three Falcons in the vicinity of the football there's Kenny Gant watch can't coming in from the left there's the right hand knocks out the ball Broussard can't get back up and risin is there Mike n is there drew Hill is there and yet the lone cowboy comes away with the ball look in against I gotta make things happen for the cowboy three interceptions you've got three sacks good football player on one of the fine special teams players in the entire league at all Cowboys with a tenpoint lead first down at the Falcon 48 yard line thank sit down on a 40 for a gain of eight Jesse Tuggle and Jesse Solomon converge for the tackle we keep this in perspective for Dallas they need to win tonight to wrap up the NFC Eastern Division guaranteeing that home field guaranteeing a week off the least home field for the first game and the first NFC Championship since 1985 for America's team which is back and they will also put them in a position to host the NFC Championship game just by chance the 49ers Lonnie's tackled by Donaldson and Emmitt Smith has now gained 67 yards tonight so he's on a pace to go over a hundred that average anytime that it's on the far side of borer creeping towards five that's where Smith is tonight 4.8 yards per carry that's just plain oldfashioned but whipping at the line of scrimmage the Dallas offensive line routed everybody in the black jersey out of there that's exactly what that defense gives us pushoff there is no flags nor will there be one but Tim McCoy is still going at it with the official on the sidelines and Danny want to listen let's watch it from ground level coming right at us let's open Harper with the tremendous size at 63 and he does get the left hand out to keep that separation he has so very good just enough keep him away pretty smart play by Alvin Harper extra point final in Delhi it is good if he would have rocked Makai er back by hitting him that hard that brings the flag but he did not be back he really just kind of absorbs him with the left hand and goes up and makes it bigtime play by Harper Maru was a sevenfoot high jumper in high school a few moments ago you saw him leap high over the heads of Tim LeClair and using the asset that that both he and Michael Irvin have and that is the tremendous size that wide receiver where it comes in handy when you're in close quarters with another DB having it and using it they can do both Lynne Elliot rookie out of Texas Tech for the first time tonight Dion got the football in the middle of the field one that did not hang up there and let the coverage get downfield he tried to exploit it and he was really hammered Dion's neon is on the verge of running out of gas he's trying is a good effort right up the middle he takes to the area and before he even gets up off the ground the ball comes out don't man me at this logic and Tommy äôt was the closest cowboy to him after 29 now he might be hurt too he he's under the stand rolled under the stands we're gonna have to scrape him out well there he is okay whether he got into the end zone or not he deserves it well what an effort whether he got in or not he's got it mr. pickles he's gonna keep it keeps the ball that was beautiful what an effort reminiscent of a run by Barry Sanders where he was hit stop look at this look at the number of hits he takes but nobody from the Falcons wraps up I'd say their leading tackler Jesse Tuggle had his arms wrapped around him and he still was able to bend and twist out Lynn Elliott for the point after and so a 10 point halftime lead in three minutes and 35 seconds has been extended to a 24 point margin Smith well at least we see Dion returned another kickoff bench press will take a look at this more importantly drop that that's Dion coming off the field after the fumble and then watching this for is 34 to 10 and Lynne Elliot says this one walk Sanders his hand and out of the end zone for a touchback and they've got the scrap we've got a fight down here is that Vincent Smith that's been some snap yep and you've got Chuck Smith down there as well this brought out a flag will it be our basic offsetting Larry Nemours is the referee Jimmie Johnson watching his team respond after last week's agonizing defeat the call is against the Cowboys we only saw the the signal one way so he assumed personal bombs after the dead wall on number 57 of the kicking team it would be 15 yards from the 20 yard so Vincent smithing Jimmie Johnson wants to know why you don't have while sitting here we're at the very least so let's go on oh yeah an explanation of what happened and now this is a you know this is a point in time where people us to say they're they're leading by 24 points Jimmy doesn't want to see his team lose concentration football coaches have a tendency of kicking it into high gear right here because they to let up at all around the 35yard line that catch is made by Drew Hill he takes it out to the 44 yard line gain of nine and it's been that kind of a season and lots of meetings of that sort on the Falcon sideline meanwhile Sanders a prime time has not done what he would prefer to do in prime time both of his fumbles come under the klieg lights second and one at the 44 is Wade Wilson 41 of damage Michael Haynes has a first down still Andre Rison has yet to see his first reception he hasn't got one over no and there's our Andre Shawn before the game he's going around humming bump up a bum you know the Monday night open theme he loves playing on Monday night but he's been blank tonight he's ready for some football eighty receptions coming in tonight first and ten order but they still tackle by Thomas Evert another pickup by the Cowboys Everett didn't sign his contract with Pittsburgh so they picked up Thomas and we talked about at the top of the show it's Jerry Jones and Jimmie Johnson and they may go all the calls and they go out and they get the Halley's and they do the drafting and they get the Everett's and they put all of the pieces and the puzzle together and if they don't win the Super Bowl they're sure gonna come close that one is brought here to get lockjaw quickly no you don't have much to say the other team has the ultimate comment look at the scoreboard and in the shadows there is Jerry Jones and he and Jimmie Johnson as many of you know the story they were teammates at the University of Arkansas Jerry made his money in oil they mused about owning and coaching a team together one day Thursday today did he get it back as the question is the 36yard line we got it looked like one of the Falcons offensive linemen covered it up and he did Kenneth Gant is the guy who dislodged it yeah making something happened once again
