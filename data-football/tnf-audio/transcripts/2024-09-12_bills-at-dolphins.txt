 About it, last year, 22% of the kicks were returned, so one out of three. I think the league wanted a little bit more. They're still kicking a lot of touchbacks. The kicker, of course, is at the 35. The kicking team lines up at the other 40. The receiving team at the 35, and nobody can touch it unless it lands into the landing zone between the goal line and the 20 and another touchback. So pretty much what we saw last season. Tua Tungabailoa, now one of the highest paid guys in the league in his fifth year. Picked him in the first round in 2020. Joe Burrow was the number one pick. And then it came down to you on Tungabailoa or Justin Herbert. And they went back to back. Miami took Tua. The Chargers took Herbert. Last year led the league in passing yardage. Checking out the first play call here. Lively crowd already. and they start from the 30-yard line out of the pistol formation. Short trap, quick throw, caught. 34-yard line, that's Jalen Waddle, who's had three straight 1,000-yard seasons. Rasul Douglas making the tackle. You know, I thought yesterday Mike McDaniel telling us that Tua had a game-changing offseason, carrying himself in a different way since January was a strong statement. You mentioned the numbers he put up, but I think as far as just the mental toughness and really buying in and becoming the guy for this franchise, he's taken huge strides coming into this year. Second down through the middle. Taking it out about a yard shy of the first down is HM. They've got Mostert is in active tonight. You know, you're talking about Tua and, of course, Tyree Kilsen last week at halftime. They were down by a lot of points. and he got up there and he said, it's the first time I've ever heard his Hawaiian accent. And he said, I wasn't even that way in high school. He went to school at St. Louis High School in Honolulu. And I think that speaks volumes about what Mike McDaniel is talking about, where he has definitely become the alpha and the leader of this team in the offense. Third down and one. Give it to the fullback, and through the middle goes Alec Ingold for a first down. For all the hype and the talk and the perception of Tua and, of course, Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddle and the pre-snap motion and all the bells and whistles, if you talk to the coaches and these players, they'll tell you it really starts at the line of scrimmage. They pride themselves on their physicality. They pride themselves on running the ball to set up every other aspect where you can get Tyreek Hill and others involved. Again out of the pistol. Motion here with Julian Hill. A little toss back and a great tackle in the backfield. Breaking through. That's Rasul Douglas making his second tackle of the night for a loss there. He has the body of a safety. He came over last year from Green Bay in late October. And you can see he is really a guy that's able to get away from blocks. Engel that time goes inside and frees up Rasul Douglas to be able to make that play. and a loss at yardage. Very important for Miami within this system with this offensive line against the Bills to stay on schedule and not get behind the sticks. Loss of three, second and 13. Again, that same formation, a little spin around. Looks downfield, deep downfield and incomplete. Tyreek Hill at an 80-yard touchdown reception on a weekend he'll never forget last weekend. Christian Benford covering on the play and that's going to set up a third down and 13. The Bills' corners aren't the fastest. They're bigger. So, Benford, look at the head start. He's anticipating the shot. So, he is five, maybe seven yards out in front. First couple plays, they had two safeties back. That time, only one safety. But also, great job of Benford needing to, just in case, they took that shot, getting back there in position to defend that deep throw. And missing, Karen Johnson. Their safety hurt inactive tonight. That pass is almost picked off and picked off on the deflection. The Bills have it. The Bills have it to the 36-yard line. That's Jamarcus Ingram. So knocked away, deflected, intended. That time for Grant DuBose, who'd be their three or four receiver. And an early turnover sets up the Bills in great shape. DuBose just came over recently, and the timing is off here. He is not ready for this football. Tua does a good job looking right. Comes back left, right into the window. Boom, right on the money. And I don't know if Benford got a hand on that football or DeBose just wasn't ready for it. Really good throw on Buffalo. One, there's chosen if you don't recognize him. He used to go by the name Robbie Anderson when he was with the Jets. 41 seconds left in the quarter. This time it's Shakir. So both teams using their number 10 on plays, running plays. Hill on one side, Shakira on the other. Holland makes the tackle, second down. Well, that's one way you go on the road against a team that you've dominated, right? You get these turnovers early in a football game and plus territory. Buffalo's going to let the clock run out, and we will change sides of the field and go to the second quarter. It is the end of Hartung. Two of first time in 55 career games. Two picks in the first quarter. But the game is tied. 7-7 as we start here at second down and 8. the Bills at the 42-yard line. Allen takes a throw. He's going to take off and slides to a stop at the 39-yard line. Jalen Ramsey that time forced the issue. So when he sees his guys covered, off he goes, and he does that, of course, with great frequency. David Long giving him a few words like, you do that one too many times, we're going to knock you out type of thing. That pump fake is legendary with Josh Allen. And emphasized this week with Anthony Weaver telling his guys, do the best you can to play through his right hand. Do not get airborne on those pump fakes. Easier said than done. Third down, five. Allen fires, and it's Shakir. Making the grab there to move the sticks. Tackled by David Lone. Shakir is the only wide receiver on the roster who had ever caught a pass from Allen coming into this season. And I think besides the tight ends, not just because of the experience, just his skill set. This is the guy. Look at that. Nice job of just settling in the zone there. And how about the protection by the offensive line to make sure he had a chance to be able to survey and work through the progressions. An area he's really worked on and make that throw. In the backfield. Cook escapes the first man and turns what would have been a loss into a nice little gain. Got away from Jalen Ramsey, who, of course, covers, can blitz, can normally stop you in the backfield, but not that time. Gain of three. Jalen Ramsey sees Mac Hollins going in motion, and he's going to shoot right here underneath another Florida State alum, Keon Coleman. and he's able to get underneath there, impact the play, and allow the rest of the Dolphins to try to get in on that tackle. But a pretty good effort by James Cook there just to keep that play alive. Second and seven. Curtis Samuels set up outside at the 30-yard line. Allen looking left. Allen throwing left. Looking for Samuel and broken up in the end zone. So Curtis Samuel, one of the new receivers, Jordan Brooks, able to not get away. Samuel coming over as a free agent from the Commanders. Brooks, as you said, coming over. Brooks is a guy that I think has this skill set because of the speed that he has. He can run. That's Curtis Samuel who can go. Never quite gets his head turned around to locate the football, but does have good position and gets that left arm up at the last second. Third and seven. Four-man rush. Allen with time. Incomplete. Throws it low. Trying to get it to Kai Johnson, the third down back. So fourth down. In comes the field goal unit to attempt about a 45, 46-yard field goal. A good job there by Sean McDermott and Anthony Weaver changing up the look. Settled back in zone. Gave him a different look. Moved after the snap. Got him a little bit uncomfortable. All he could do was throw it away. Ball at a 43-yard attempt. Sam Martin to hold it. Tyler Bass to kick it. And from 43, it is right down the middle. 12.41 remaining in the first half at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. Buffalo on top. Good. So last year, week 18, there it was and enough mistakes. and with four seconds to go it's a 14 point game so again the Dolphins in a situation that they were in last week against the Jacksonville Jaguars so we'll only see another touchback maybe not this time he may want the clock to run out with a short runback. No, sir. I have an idea at the end of the first inning. What do you got? I have two ideas. Number one, a touchback maybe comes out to the 35-yard line. I know Mike Florio's been on top of that. Yeah. Not a bad idea. Or make the kicker go back to his 30-yard line. You just want to see. Everybody wants to see the return. That's the whole point here. That's what you want. Yeah. I think everybody, think about what Buffalo dealt with. They take a 10-point lead last week. They think they're in good shape. and Arizona returns one for a touchdown. So I think a lot of people are saying the answer is, hey, we'll just kick it into the end zone and let him start at the 30. Absolutely. Because the average start last year was the 26th. I don't know if Kyle Shanahan said, hey, what's the difference? That's the end of the first half. Dominated by the visitors. Two ahead, 13 completions, 18 attempts, 97 yards. 24-10, and we go to Kaylee. Well, Coach, your offense likes to say everybody eats. How have you been to achieve the balance we've seen tonight? Well, everyone's just doing their job. That's what we've got to do. We've got to continue with this. This team is powerful, potent on offense and special teams, so we've got to keep it up here. Yeah, but on defense, even with the key injuries you have, how have you been able to neutralize Miami's big playability and that speed? Again, guys are just making plays, getting off blocks, being strong with their fundamentals, believing in each other. Thanks, Coach. Thank you. All right, thank you, Kelly. Coming up after the break, Hills will get the ball. Sanders to kick it off. Every kickoff tonight has resulted in a touchback. This time, we're going to see a run back. Stop the presses through the four-yard line and bringing it back out to the 27-yard line is Ray Davis. Moments ago, Kaylee down on the field with Michael Daniels. Mike, you're down double digits at half for a second game in a row. How was halftime handled? You know, there was constructive energy. I think our football team is smart enough to know that if you're minus three in the turnover battle, what else would you expect? We have to be a lot cleaner in how we operate. We need to make some plays on both sides of the ball. And, yeah, we didn't expect it to be easy. Did you see the response and the challenge from your quarterback during the half that you saw last week? Absolutely. I think there is comfort to a degree in the fact that this is not uncharted territory for our second game. We obviously wouldn't. You know, guys are pretty pissed off that we're in this situation, so we'll see what we do with it. All right. Thank you. All right. That was McDaniel moments ago. They start this drive here. The Bills do. Pass to the outside. Outside, staying in bounds and picking up some extra yardage is Dalton Kincaid. You know, Mike just said, you're down 3-0 in the turnover. Officially, it's only two, but that fourth down thing, which doesn't count as an official turnover, might as well. Yeah, and if you throw that in, that's 17 points. Like we talked about, we came back, and he said what we said. You've got to take care of the football. First thing they've got to do is tackle and get a stop here against Josh Allen, who has an offensive line that had a heck of a first half, Both run blocking and taking care of Allen. He wasn't touched. Second and one. Need one. Get about five. James Cook now having a heck of a night. Has carried the ball six times for 65 yards. Big thing that Joe Brady likes to do. We saw it last year when they would bring in David Edwards as that sixth offensive lineman. You see on the left side there, Alec Anderson, in his second year out of UCLA, comes in and gives him that in that short yardage. I love the patience. James Cook came out and talked to his coaches about he missed a few plays last week. The vision wasn't quite there. He had some good ones and some bad ones. Tonight he's been very good. Quick throw outside, cutting back inside, picking up a few. Curtis Samuel takes it to the 50-yard line. Second and seven, David Long makes the stop. There's Weaver, the defensive coordinator. Weaver and McDaniel go back to the Houston Texans a number of years ago. Same staff down there. He's leading the way now in the middle. Fourth and two. Line up to go for it. Empty the backfield. Tungabaloa under pressure, and he's going to go down in a sack at the 48-yard line. Ed Oliver bursting through, sent everybody into the pattern. Not only do they turn it over, but they turn it over in their own territory. 345 to halftime. The Bills up by 10 with the ball. They're on that fourth and two to get the Bills the ball back. Great play by the big fella. Well, Miami's been here before. In fact, four days ago, they were down by 14. And that's when Tua made that speech in the locker room. They hit the daily double. They scored at the end of the first half and then got the ball to start the second half. And scored again. Buffalo at the 49-yard line. On the ground. Breaking tackles. James Cook inside the 20. Inside the 5. Somersault to the touchdown. Whoa! Going 49 yards. So Oliver gets the big sack. Turn it over. One play. And a touchdown. So this guy, Cook, is a football player. What a way to take advantage of that turnover on downs. And this play, wait till you see this, Hal. Talk about zone blocking, usually you see double teams. This is a triple team that opened this hole up. Bass. Extra point. Take a look. Yeah, look at this. Watch Spencer Brown, Torrance, McGovern on the right side. They just take away the interior. This is Deshaun Hand. I don't know what 11 David Long's thinking. He loses his footing. Doesn't fit that gap at all. And then Poirier off to the left there. The former Bill takes a poor angle. And then that's just speed from James Cook. Once he gets to the outside, there's no one left to slow him down. What a player. we were talking about Cook probably a little underrated fourth in the league in rushing last year's sixth in Strimmage and probably maybe a little bit underrated because you think of his brother Dalvin who was a star of course with Minnesota and now he's on the Dallas practice squad and how fired up is he back home grew up here, his mom's here his family's here, a lot of emotion for him to come back and have a chance to play and be the guy and he's having a great night by the way that's ten points off turnovers and then seven more off of that turnover of downs. So a 17-point Buffalo lead. Tyler Bass. Kickoff number six. Touchback number six from the 30. So Friday nights are for the... A week ago. Obviously a different set of circumstances, but to be down 14, and they all talked about how we all had to come together. Jalen Ramsey said we had each other's back. Special teams, defense, offense, and how that can build a team. And here they are again. 17 down in the first half. Let's see what they do to try to come back and climb back into this football game. Buffalo was also down 14 last week at one point. Overcame that pass. No game right there for Waddle. Tackled there at the line of scrimmage by Cam Lewis. Second down, second and ten. I just feel like from up here, Buffalo's playing with a chip on their shoulder, coming down here with some new faces. They don't have their safeties from last year, playing with Rapp and Hamlin. Starting nickel is out. You just saw Cam Lewis make a great play there in the open field. Bernard goes down with an injury. No problem. Bring Spector in. I don't know. They just seem like they're playing with a bit of an attitude here, which I love. No question. Playing with a short deck and dominating. Blitz coming. Look out. Pass is caught into traffic, and that's a game of a first down of 12 yards for a first down. Williams able to stop A-chan. They bring the blitz. Specter's coming. Watch to the outside here. Getting upfield is Vaughn Miller. He actually almost gets in the way of this football, but perfectly timed to get the ball out quickly with that middle linebacker on the blitz. Doesn't even have time to get the laces. Puts it a little bit behind. Moved on. and this year he's handed those duties over to Bobby Babich. Again, you can see the plan tonight. Just try to keep the speed in front of him, but you're going to have to tackle well against some very elusive running backs and receivers. A little spinorama again. A lot of action, but HN is picking up just a yard on that on a second down, or a second down now. Eppinessa making the tackle, second and long. The snap kind of affects the timing here. A heck of a play by Tua just to be able to catch that ball and still get it out to A-Chan. Lucky to get that back to the line of scrimmage. He looked like he might abort and give up on handing it off, but nice job by A-Chan just waiting for him just long enough. A couple of high snaps already from Aaron Brewer. This time a good snap, good throw inside the 20 to the 18-yard line. goes Jeff Wilson. So he would move up to be the number two back now in the absence of Mostert with HN number one. But a guy who's very versatile, Mike McDaniel had him in San Francisco. There's Mostert. 21 total touchdowns last season tied for the Mostert in the lead. And then they bring in Jalen Wright, you know, and Jeff Wilson, Mostert, HN. They're all in that 4-3-5 range. I mean, every single one of them. Von Miller now in the game for Buffalo. Had a sack last week, snapping a 14-game drought. Tua steps up, finds the open man, and inside the five at the one-yard line, Jalen Waddell. They'll spot it just outside the goal line. So first and goal from the one. We're used to seeing Josh Allen make this kind of move from, now we see it from Tua. steps up and he really freezes Cam Lewis there. His eyes are in the backfield on Tua, concerned about the potential him taking off. Tua looks downfield, doesn't even hesitate to get that ball to Jalen Waddle and they're moving that ball in front of those safeties right down the field. Reaching for it, didn't quite get there, first down and goal. A-chan, can he get there? The ball is out! And Hill comes up with it. He may move him down, let's see, before the fumble. But anyway, Hill came up with the ball. Flag is thrown. It'll be second down and goal. And the play blown dead anyway. Looks like Liam Eikenberg, right guard, with the penalty. So back now to the six-yard line. Yep. Pretty clear there. Blade blown dead. At that moment in time coming into the backfield now A-Chan setting up next to Tua. A little motion here. Give it to A-Chan again. Threads his way for a yard, maybe two. With under four minutes to play now. In the first quarter, Ed Oliver makes the tackle. Go back to the strategy of what Buffalo is trying to do, make them earn it. This will be the 10th play of this drive for Mike McDaniel and his offense for the Dolphins. So this is what the game's going to come down to. You're going to move the ball. You're going to give up yards if you're Buffalo. What happens in the red area? Are they kicking field goals or are they scoring touchdowns? Miami, last year, second best in the league in the red zone. Second and goal. to a under pressure flips it to the outside and HN is there the defender falling down and HN walks into the end zone Dan Lewis falling down easy road to six two Dolphins out in the flat Bailin Spector actually gets lost right here in coverage Watch how he just, he'll look around trying to figure out if he has a cross or he needs to get out in the flat and deal with the back because you've got two Dolphins out there. Cam Lewis cannot make the play by himself, especially with Ingold out there. H.A. now 13 touchdowns in 13 career games. Sanders ties the game with the extra point. Perfect balance on that drive. Ten plays, five runs, five passes. 321 to go in the quarter, 7-7. That was. It ended at the one-yard line with Doug Flutie trying to hit Andre. Just running around. Too much traffic for David Long to get through. Extra point by Tyler Bass. So the interception. Then they go 37 yards, six plays into the end zone. after that pick, it was good. 7-0 bubble. Raining off and on earlier today, and this kickoff will result in another touchback. So two for two on the touchbacks, and they come out to the 30-yard line. Something to keep an eye on. We introduced this last year on Black Friday, and we're going to have it most of the entire year this year. The red orbs that you see as defensive alerts. That's not necessarily predicting who's going to blitz. Just kind of alerting who looks maybe unusual as a threat to maybe come after the quarterback. And with the help of AI, we can get inside the mind of these quarterbacks and try to identify the potential blitzers in real time. Kind of a cool thing. Yeah, I'm afraid AI is going to get into our brains. Already got you in Paris. Yes, they did. First down. Look out, pressure on, throws into traffic, but getting away, that's on his John Smith, the tight end after the 45-yard line. Didn't do much last week, want to use him a lot more if they possibly can. In his eighth year, one catch last week against Jacksonville, that's all. A growing trend all over the NFL in the opening week is defense is putting two safeties back. We saw against Patrick Mahomes a couple years ago, Andy Reid and Mahomes had to adjust to that. But now we're seeing it really all over the NFL. That's why some of the numbers are down for the quarterbacks. You can see it here. It's forcing quarterbacks to be patient, and you've got to be able to run the football. Now you've got Waddle on an end around into some traffic there. And Jalen Waddle picks up four. When you talk about Hill, you talk about Waddle. I mean, that's as good as it gets as far as a one-two combination is concerned anywhere. Oh, yeah. I don't think you could maybe look at different style, but Jamar Chase, when he's going with Tee Higgins, when they're healthy, but these two, I think, set the tone. And Jalen Waddle, I think, is the number one two receiver in this league. But, again, they are not messing around with Buffalo. Short week, respect for the speed in Miami, what they can do on this offense. Again, for most of this night, they're going to make them earn it and have to drive the length of the field, not give up the big play. A little flip here. Here goes Tyreek Hill. Turns the corner, and Hill is bounced out of bounds. at the 42-yard line. Bounced out there by Benford and a first down for the Dolphins. And again, if you're going to keep those safeties back, you're going to have to rally to the ball and get as many hats as you can against his speed and how shifty he is, obviously. Gets hit right as he's about to go out of bounds there by the corner, Christian Benford. But that's the answer. Run the football, short pass game, and then you've got to make it happen in the red zone. Gain of 10. Seven grabs, 130 last week, and an 80-yarder and a flag. So we will hear from Bill Vinovich for the first time tonight. Full start. Office number 89. Five-yard penalty. Still first down. As highly respected a referee as there is, Bill Vinovich has refereed three Super Bowls, including last year's Classic, Kansas City and San Francisco. What's the over-under in how many games you've called of his? lot he's called a lot of you know big games to the night Monday night Thursday night you name it he good though consistently good McDermott and his eighth season McDaniel and his third as you look at the coaches and now a first and 15 A little flip back here A has room there he goes Should have a first down Austin Jackson leading the way, the right tackle. So A-Chan who averaged last year over seven yards per carry, this time good for 14. They're going to spot it a little bit short. Yeah, the motion and then the misdirection with him turning to the left just gets the linebackers to take one step the opposite direction and create space for him to be able to get out there and find that alley to the right there. Second in inches. A little more than halfway through the first quarter. Hill in motion. Ball handed up through the middle. Big hole. Exploits it. First down. HN again to the 25-yard line. Again, Raheem Mostert is first. He would probably be, you know, he's 1-1-A. He and HN, but we're going to see a lot more of HN tonight because Mostert's down. Bobby Babbage taking over as the defensive play caller. Sean McDermott is the head coach. Took those duties over when Leslie Frazier. But with the speed and suddenness of HN, he gets the first down and gets upfield. Ticking down for the two-minute warning. First down here. And again, keep it on the ground up to the 46. Pretty much taking the crowd out of the game. There's no chance for a two-for-one here for Miami like it was last week for Buffalo because they deferred. So they're going to get the ball. The Bills are on the second half. That's going to take us to the two-minute warning. The Buffalo Bills dominating in Miami 24-7. So let's see if Miami can get something happening here in the last two minutes. Second down and seven. Going to keep it on the ground. Into the 49-yard line goes HM. Spector taking the place of Bernard, who got hurt. We haven't seen him since making the stop. Spector has good speed. Again, he played at Clemson and was asked to do a lot of different things, Blitzing, playing out in space, covering, playing man. So he is more than capable of holding his own. It's just a matter of can he get lined up in the right spot and deal with the speed and the confusion that this offense can create. The crowd's getting a little restless with the lack of urgency here. Down by 17. A couple of runs, third down and two. And two of throws, and that'll move the sticks, but it's just a short game. John O'Smith makes the catch. Crowd doesn't like the play calling on this drive. They've got all three timeouts, and I think that's why you're not seeing the urgency. But you're right. I mean, they need a touchdown here with the Bills getting the ball. From the 45. It's almost as if they're waiting to get into the locker room and just regroup and try something different. H-A in their short game, under a minute. Second down. But, again, Buffalo's going to get the ball, and we start the second half. We keep going back to this team with Buffalo and their system on a short week. Probably what they do in a regular week, sitting back with their two safeties, trying to take away those easy shots, trying to affect the timing and the rhythm, and the short underneath passing by disrupting the timing, getting after these receivers. It's been working here so far. But you've got a team with Hill and Waddle and, you know, a lot of yards after the catch. Letting the clock run, everything is short. A little toss back here. That's going to go nowhere. and that will create a lot of consternation in the audience. Third down and 12. Surprised these timeouts are not being used. Again, Ed Oliver in the middle of this defense, whether he's on the right side or the left side, that time against Eichenberg and got right through him. Well, now they're going to use a timeout for 32 seconds and we'll be back in 30 seconds. It's 3 and 11. Kirk, you tell me, this is the kind of drive where you look like you're running out the clock. Yeah, I mean, this drive started with 3.36. Three timeouts, the two-minute warning, and lack of urgency, not using the timeouts. I think everybody's kind of surprised, not to mention they had to capitalize on this drive with Buffalo getting the ball in the third quarter. Like they're playing defense. I mean, it's like, you know, they're afraid something bad's going to happen. To it. Plushed out. He's going to keep it. He's going to run with it. He's going to pick up a first down. All right. The crowd likes that, but that secondary did its job. I mean, you've got Hill out there. You've got Waddle out there. Jono Smith. You've got a lot of guys who can really bust it open. Nothing. Now, Tyreek Hill now checking out of the game. And you've got DuBose, who made a mistake. earlier not getting his head turned around and it caused a turnover. And I think the reason they go to the bigger receivers is they've got to try to get the ball downfield. Also, Robbie Chosen into the game. 27 seconds. That's Wilson in motion. Catches it. Gets to the 29-yard line. They've got two timeouts. clock runs a couple of seconds further and then they call it right here second and four really that's you're talking about yards after the catch the problem is Buffalo I understand what you're saying but Buffalo did a pretty good job of running the football taking away some of the space that they're used to working with underneath there what did we have two quarterbacks last week throw for over 300 yards yeah that's it Tua and then Matthew Stafford in a losing battle against Detroit in overtime. That's it, just two guys. There was more familiarity, of course, and we talked at the beginning of the broadcast how Anthony Weaver really, being a former player in the NFL with the Ravens, fits in perfectly with the culture that Mike McDaniel has here. Second and seven from midfield and slipping. in the logo, I think, was James Cook, Jordan Brooks. Put that logo in midfield, and it's more slippery than the grass itself. Yeah, here's a big opportunity. This is what I'm sure they talked about at halftime. If they're in Miami, hey, we're down 14. We were here last week. Part of being able to be down and fight back and win a football game is it shows a new group that, hey, we can do this. He'd get in there at halftime tonight and say, guys, we were here last week. Let's do this. Let's get a stop and get the ball back to Tua. Third and seven, and timeout is called by the Dolphins. Some of the things you don't want to have to do down by 14 is waste or use whatever you want to call it, a timeout in the first couple of minutes of the third quarter. And 12 guys on the field, and Kalis Campbell started to work his way off the field, but they couldn't afford the penalty, so they had to use the timeout. I'm sure a big part this is a divisional matchup early in the year. I'm sure a big part of it with Mike McDaniel and some of the leaders on that team were talking about we've got to match the intensity that this Bills team showed up with tonight. Let's not wait. Let's take the fight to them on our turf. We're here in Miami. Didn't look like that in the first half. Third and seven. Bringing that third down back, Johnson. Get the rookie, Chop Robinson, off to the left with line side. He's right here. He's got great speed. Can he get through? Allen is chased. Allen throws, and Allen throws it behind. Marquez Valdez-Scantling came over from Kansas City. Fuller covering on the play. Pressure was put on Allen at the time. and Miami does get an important early second half stop. They get to stop. They showed blitz and then ended up backing out of it. Brought four. A little twist there with Robinson. He wowed a lot of people with his speed and what he can do. The rookie out of Penn State in that time just flushing. Josh Allen not allowing him to make that accurate throw gets the Dolphins defense off the field. Robinson their first round pick. Got a punt here from Martin. Fair catch is called for. And made at the 11-yard line by Braxton Berrios. Two is starting from deep in his own territory. Being able to find ways to get Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddell with football as often as you'd like to see. Similar to last week. And a lot of this has been, you see some man coverage here, but a lot of it's been zoned. And, you know, they don't want to leave their corners. They're bigger corners on islands against that speed. So they've been keeping safeties over top to help them. Now remember last week against Jacksonville. Just when you think, wow, Jacksonville's doing a great job. Bang, one play. And you see an 80-yard touchdown by Tyreek Hill. So that's what Miami's banking on, finding ways to get 17 and 10 loose. Meanwhile, for what it's worth, Lester Cotton takes over at left guard and plays to Robert Jones. See if that makes a difference up front. Gain of one. Williams makes the tackle on 8-hand. And we go to Kaylee. Well, yeah, guys, we just learned that Miami's left guard, Rob Jones, is questionable to return because of a shoulder injury. That's why you see Lester Cotton in there. He has his helmet in his hand, but in a long conversation with the trainer. And we have also gotten confirmation from the Bills that their middle linebacker, their leading tackler and captain of the defense, Terrell Bernard, will not return to this game because of a pectoral injury. Yeah, went out with that in the first quarter. Second down and eight, but they have withstood about everything on defense. Specter Cliff over for him. Fans is swinging that. Nate Chan, he'll gallop his way for a first down that past the 20-yard line. There's some space, finally, for one of their speedsters to work with. And he just looks this downfield. Good look here at high sky to be able to get a feel on the left-hand side. See the bills sinking? That's the plan, again. You saw him lose his footing there. Christian Benford, eyes downfield. Check it down. That's been a big emphasis. Remember on our call with Mike McDaniel, he said, we want you to feel comfortable checking it down. You don't always have to throw it. And Tua's really bought into that. On the ground here, looking for some space. Gain of four for HN. I think that's worth watching with Cotton in for Jones, who has the... More running in the first week than there has been in years and less passing. Now, again, that's a tiny sample size. I'm not saying that's a trend, but who knows? Yeah, who knows? We'll see. But we're seeing it again tonight with Buffalo's defense. Again, the two-high safety look, forcing the short passing game. Yards after the catch, making you have to run the football. Be sound at the line of scrimmage. Yeah, Miami's run 36 plays, 20 runs, 16 passes. Second and four. Fires over the middle. That's caught. Hill tackled. and you've got the clock stopping at 16. You're now out of timeouts. And, of course, you've got a chance here. If you bring in your field goal kicker, which is absolutely something they're going to need here, Sanders has made his last six for 50-plus. He's a good one. There's an example of what we've seen in this first half. You get the ball out in a hurry, and you get it to your guy, Tyree Kill, and as soon as he catches the ball, You've got two or three Buffalo defenders not allowing him. That's leveraging the football, not allowing him to get an angle to get out in the space. And, boy, that's exactly what they dialed up this week in hoping to take away the potential of the big play, like you said, if they throw it underneath and let him try to get loose. It's hard when there's three white jerseys there running the ball. Now he's got to be careful without the timeouts. Ball's got to get out in a hurry. Exactly. Waddle is wide left. Hill is wide right. And you've got a timeout here taken by the defense. Sean McDermott. A lot of success in Buffalo. He says, you know, we'll win that big one. He's got to be an optimist. Eighth year already. But he's been in the playoffs six times in his seven seasons. He really helped turn that franchise around. Yeah, and I think the previous 20 years, you know, they've only been to the playoffs a couple times. So I think he's doing a great job. It's just a matter of taking that next step. I like the fact he talked with us about going back to just being the head coach and being there for the team. Last year kind of set the bar in showing the assistants and showing the team as the play caller on the defense, but it takes a lot of time to get that plan ready. Now he's relying on Bobby Babich, who's in his seventh year on the staff. There's Brandon Bean, the GM. But they feel good about this team. Like I said, if they can maintain this collective chip that they're playing with tonight, There's reason for optimism. Coming down here on the road, Hock Knight leading by 17. To it, to the outside, and then stepping out of bounds at the 15-yard line is Jonu Smith. Now you're down at 12 seconds. And again, with no timeouts, you've got to work the edges or the end zone. Yeah. I think Buffalo, again, just trying to keep it in front that time, they probably gave up a few more yards than they would have liked to because now Tua potentially has a couple shots into the end zone here. Twelfth play of a drive. Five runs, six passes. And now you've got another timeout. Buffalo takes this one. After they looked at the alignment, Steve Ross is the owner of the Miami Dolphins, usually successful in the real estate world and of course chairman of the board, managing general partner he's watched his team go to the playoffs the last two years, remember last year they lost to Buffalo at the end of the season had they won that game they would not have had to go to Kansas City and go to Ice Station Zebra for that wild card game which of course Kansas City won but that was a very, very costly loss. It just felt like the last three or four weeks of the season they were kind of limping home. They didn't look like that was a big emphasis for them is being able to be the same team for 17 weeks. Yeah, last couple of years the same thing. Hot start. Not so hot finish. Tua to the outside and throws that one away. Now you've got third down. Now you've got eight seconds. And, of course, the Bills are taking the end zone away as best they can. They're not going to fool around here. They're going to send in the field goal unit. Sanders won last week's game at the gun. That was the only time in the game that the Dolphins had the lead. 0-0-0. Kicked a 52-yarder. This is a chip shot for him. 34 yards. And the kick is good. Third and long. Hits him. No, it's right off the shoulder pad. Head's not turned and ready to make the play. So the Bills get the first turnover of the game and give Josh Allen plus territory. His first career interception. Start of the 37. Quick throw outside. And a nice little game here. Fighting his way for a game of close to nine. is Dalton Kincaid, the tight end. So Josh Allen, two passing touchdowns, two rushing touchdowns. What else is new? Last week, hurt himself, hurt that hand. You can see it's wrapped, the left hand, and I'm throwing him. Wearing a glove as well, but he stayed in the game last week, and he says he's perfectly fine. Looked to be on that play. Second and one. Game here, first down. taken inside the 24-yard line. Hook again. Stopped there by Kendall Fuller. Now in his ninth season, there's the glove. There's the glove, and you see the two middle fingers taped together. What surprised me is the size of that glove. That's not a receiver glove. You see the padding on there, almost like a lineman glove or like a linebacker would wear that type of glove, but it is protected and taken care of. Quick throw again, this time to the right side. And in another game, Kincaid wasn't used a lot last week. But this is a team with Kincaid and also they have Dawson Knox that is going to use the tight end a lot this season. Yeah, you'll see a lot of 12 personnel with one running back and two tight ends. Kincaid has the skill set with all the losses of receiver with Dave Davis and Stephon Diggs. He can get out wide and be able to make plays. It's like he took a knee to the head there after he was down right into the face mask. No flex, second down and two Allen, the fake, the roll, the throw is incomplete Maybe a third down and two Back we go to Josh Allen Of course, one of the highest paid I think every week we're going to have some of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league Right now everybody's chasing Dak Preston after last week Yeah, you know, he has obviously been the face of this franchise for a long time But I think with the moves of Higgs and Davis out, Sean McDermott really looking for him. Almost looks like a new chapter for him taking over. On third down, they bring in Ty Johnson as the third down back. Third and two. Here comes the blitz. And look out. Stuff him. That's David Long, Jr. Read it. Came flying through. Stops him in the backfield. Fourth down. it looks like they're going to go for this that was a perfectly timed blitz there by David Long, good call by Anthony Weaver Anthony Weaver, the new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was here last year crowd and full decibel right now on fourth down and three as at least they will line up to go for it Cook back in the backfield and now Curtis Samuel there as well and Allen took a look at the defense and calls a timeout so let's see if they now bring in the field goal unit or go for it Josh Allen talked about how much command he has in his seventh year taking over and really having to rebuild this offense with basically an entire new room of wide receivers. I think the tight ends, Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid, will be heavily involved in it tonight and all year. But his career, we talked all week, you and I and our whole crew, about what he's done, not just the wins and the losses, 11-2, but also what he's done as far as his numbers. He's put up, this is probably the team he's performed the best against, and Joe Brady's had an entire offseason. He took over for Ken Dorsey last year as the offensive coordinator, tire offseason to get this offense ready to go this year. Get a little bit more running. Of course, Allen is always a threat to run. Samuel goes back and forth and gets set. Pass to the outside. Wide open inside the 10. And James Cook takes it in. Kater Kuhu covering 17-yard gain, so they go for it on fourth down. A lot of eye candy there, a lot of motion, and finds the open man and the wide open man, as it turns out. Gave Miami some of their own medicine with the motion, but the matchup, this is man coverage. David Long here, Cook here. He gets caught up in the traffic right there. What a great call by Joe Brady as a man-beater there, anticipating they go man on fourth down. gets to kind of that mesh to be able to get the back out of the backfield. The two receivers do a nice job of not looking like they're setting that 10-7. After the field goal, so we've had three kickoffs, all resulting in touchbacks, and so much for the dynamic kickoff, at least in this game. Kirk? Yep. Time now for the it factor fueled by Gatorade. Let's take a look at this Buffalo defense. Down some bodies, as we know. And one guy that has stepped up early in this game is 47, Christian Benford. Great job there in coverage on that third down that led to an interception. Once the ball went in the air. Here, look at the eyes in zone. Good job of reading Tua. Ball's overthrown. He and his receiver not on the same page. And Benford does a great job of being there. So he is off to a great start. Again, not a lot of man-to-man with his size against these receivers. But playing great in zone. Great awareness tonight. So Jalen Wright, a rookie out of Tennessee, fourth-round pick. He's in the game. Behind Tua. There he goes. Picks up about four. Again, that Buffalo defense, don't forget, with Bernard out at least for the moment, 54, Baylin Spector comes in. Keep an eye on him. There he is. Yeah, Spector out of Clemson. Had a great career at Clemson. Just to reiterate, two new safeties with Hamlin and Taylor Rapp. for a couple veterans that played together. Taron Johnson out, so Cam Lewis is in for him. And now Bernard out, and you've got a backup linebacker. So a lot of backups playing here for Buffalo. New faces. And Matt Milano on injured reserve. Again through the middle. There goes the rookie. And I know you really like him. You've covered him a lot, but we've got a flag down in the offensive backfield, and it's going to negate that run. And he goes to center Brewer on a hold. Hold him. I'll get to the 72. Ten yard penalty. Instead, they get Armstead, the left tackle. I think you'll see the center definitely got involved in a hold himself. So McDaniel frustrated just when it looks like they have some positive steps forward. They end up going backwards. Left side, 72. Now right in the middle of your screen. See him get underneath the pads there. of Ed Oliver, which is tough to do. Ed Oliver is only 6'1", so not a big interior D lineman. Uses leverage and quickness that time. Armstead locked him up. Armstead, 12th few in the lead. Early on, lots of seasons with the Saints. Second down and 17. Toe with a right-handed flip. And taking off and picking up good yardage is John O'Smith, the tight end. Setting up a third down and very manageable right now after a second and 17. We just talked about how Tua's doing a good job with the way he's ball handling. Watch him here with the motion out to the left. He gives a little look like he's going to throw it to right. And then just a little no-look flick with the right underneath to Jalen Wright. Or to Joe New Smith. And he's able to pick up some big yards. He's got a real shot now to be able to convert. And I think Smith coming over gives them a threat at that tight end position, which they have not had in the last couple years. Tua with the offhand there. Tua throws and incomplete there. A lot of traffic. Tiree kill was the intended receiver, but it's a fourth down. I think there's a little bit of a hold here as he tries to work to the inside. Grabs him up top, close. Terry waves that off, says enough. Shut up, Herbstre. You don't know what you're talking about. It looked like a little bit of a collision and then a grab, but no call. and Terry says good no call. Douglas gets away with it for what it's worth. Jake Bailey to do the punting. Brandon Condrington back and makes a fair catch at the 16-yard line. 10-54 to the half. Bills on top by three. ...ground and put a 27-year veteran officer on administrative duty. Hill acknowledges he could have been better in the moment, but is publicly calling for that officer to be fired. He says he wants the incident to be a learning tool for everybody, guys. Yeah, that was an amazing situation on Sunday because pulled out of the car, is able to play, and not only plays but I don't know whether adrenaline kicks in or what. I mean, he had a great day. He did. And an 80-yard touchdown reception. I've never seen anything like that. That video is unbelievable in a way. Ray Davis is the running back. Fake to him. Throw to him. Chase down and caught. Back of the line of scrimmage. Chop Robinson making the tackle there. Second and 11. Ray Davis is a legitimate back injury because their starting left guard is on the pup. He's unable to play Isaiah Wynn. So you're essentially down to one of your third left guard. And Ed Oliver had his way many times with Robert Jones in that first half. So keep an eye on the interior of that Miami offensive line against Daquan Jones and Ed Oliver. And you've got Kendall Lamb coming off the bench. Number 70 up front. Second and six on the ground again up to the 30-yard line. They set up a third and medium. So the Miami Dolphins tonight, 23 runs already. Williams makes the stop. You hear some of the murmurs in the background, some of the booing from the fans. They want Mike McDaniel to get Tyree killed the ball. They want big plays. But it's tough to do with those safeties back. So what they're going to have to do is that's why they're running the football. They know their answer to that look is run the football, create space underneath, and try to have that yards after the catch. Here's a big third down. Third and five. Jeff Wilson 23 in the game. Tua pressure. Look out. Forced to throw it and it's going to be picked off along the sideline. Ingram untouched. So Tua under pressure trying to throw it away. Not far enough. And another run back for a score. Epinesa put the heat on. well we just talked about lester cotton coming in at left guard you also just had a backup left tackle in kendall lamb 70 and so you have two new players here to open this drive up on the left side and that's exactly where the pressure comes from and i think tuan did everything he could to try to be able to throw this ball away and he just doesn't get enough on it throws it up in the air and there once again is a Buffalo Bill. Ingram made a great play earlier with an interception. This time steps in front and has a pick six. Buffalo Bill played for the Buffalo Bulls, University of Buffalo. So he stayed home, gets the touchdown. Extra point is good. And Buffalo now with a three touchdown advantage. very cool little cooler yeah sure I all about that I don mix well with the dew point over 75 That's right. It's way over 75. Another touchback here. Okay, my man, what you got? Well, it's just been one of those nights for two in this offense. Give Buffalo all the credit for taking away his main threats. He's tried to find other options. Grant Dubose not getting his head turned around. Tip ball, interception here. Not on the same page with Robbie Chosenball. Goes over his head, interception. Then a couple backup offensive linemen in the game with Kendall Lamb and Robert Jones out. So you see Lester Cotton, and he looks to Darryl Bevel, and he says, man, should have thrown it away. Tried to. And there's Tyreek Hill saying, boys, let's go. Let's get this thing going. He was shaking his head coming off the field. He can't get loose. They've taken care of him. and Waddle tonight. Two is only thrown for 109 yards. Five and a half per throw. Pass here caught by Hill. He gets eight. Douglas makes the stop. Kaylee, what you got? Guys, the Dolphins have their left tackle. Terran Omstead back on the field with him. He came out the play just before that last interception because of a shoulder issue. He was getting a harness readjusted on his right side. You can see it if he was facing the other way, but he's back out on the field, and he and Tua had a chat just before they headed back out there together. Yeah, they had Lamb in the game at that point, and they already made the change at left guard, second and two, and the Bills exploited it. To the outside. And stuffed. Behind them, right at the line of swimmage. Taylor Rapp puts the Rapp on Jalen Wright, third down. I'll tell you what, Bobby Babich and Sean McDermott, the biggest thing, we can talk schemes and XOs all you want. The thing that I think even our viewers at home are saying, you're seeing a defense. The big emphasis this week against all this speed was keep the ball in front and fly to the football. Play smart, play fast, play physical, and we need turnovers. Those were the points that he brought up to us this week. It's exactly what we've seen from Buffalo's defense. Third and four. Eight minutes to go in the third quarter. Pressure. Miller almost got there, but he completes the pass. Big game inside Bills' territory. 43-yard line hits Waddle. His best gain of the night by far. Douglas makes the tackle first down game at 21. And Von Miller almost comes up with another sack. He had his first sack last week in the opener. Look at that spin move going around Austin Jackson. But let's give Tua a lot of credit. He couldn't step into this throw at all. Finally, you see that glance route that we always think about when it comes to Miami's offense. They still had two high, but he was able to get it between the corner, the linebacker, and his safety closing in. First down at the 43. To a open left side, but is it inbounds is the question. Hill is there. It's not. So Hill was able to get free, but he was on the chalk. Yeah, the left foot looked like it might have gotten down. I don't think the right foot was close at all. Let's see. Looks like that left foot. The left foot actually touches the line there. Yep. But you like the answer. If you're going to play that too high look, Try to squeeze the ball on those sidelines between the corner and the safety. To the outside. With some blocking in front. Nice run. Good run. Jalen Wright. Rookie fourth-round pick. Out of Tennessee. Third and short. How about Tyreek Hill this time on the veteran Vaughn Miller trying to help on a little crack block, try to set the edge here and willing to come down there and take on the big fella. Nice job, help him get to the edge. And I liked your tone there. Like, hey, that is a good run. I think Jalen Wright brings some natural ability to run the football and has not just quickness but some power. Field in motion out of the backfield. First down. A lot more to the 20-yard line before he's gang-tackled. HN. Converting on a third and short. He gets a good push. 73 right here. Austin Jackson does a good job. Everyone's kind of pinching as an offensive line down to the middle. Look at that suddenness and quick change of direction by HN. Also, we just talked about Jalen Wright having some physicality. You could see that also, the versatility of 8-chain. A fast guy, a 4-3-2 guy, but running through some of those arm tackles. Well, meanwhile, Armstead is back on the bench. He was out, came back in, and Lamb is in again. Kendrick Lamb to the end zone. A little too high and off the fingertips, and Hamlin was there, but it hit the ground intended for Julian Hill. First time they've gone after him, he'd be like the number three tight end and incomplete there, second down. Yeah, just a little bit high. So they attack the sideline between the corner and the safety. And if they're going to play too high, what's the other answer? Down the middle. Behind the backer, between the two safeties. Ball just gets up a little bit away from him. Usually if John knew Smith were in there, you'd expect him to hit that same route. Hill is a high school quarterback, played slot in college. That time just not able to bring it down. Inside six minutes in the third. to a quick throw. Caught, fighting his way to the 12-yard line. Is John O. Smith sending up another big third down here. They've kept this drive alive, 2-for-2 on third down and started back at the 30-yard line. Obviously, you look at the clock, you look at the score. I think Mike McDaniel knows they need a touchdown. Remember we talked about the game is going to come down for Miami. They're going to move the ball. What are they going to do in the red zone? Are they going to be able to come up with touchdowns or not? They're one for two so far tonight in this area. They need a touchdown on this drive. They were great last year. Second in the league in the red zone. Third down three. Big play here for them. And he's stuffed. H.N. Crowd hates the call. Ed Oliver is there. Had that big breakup on fourth down in the first half. It's fourth and four now. Remember, the left side of the offensive line with Lester Cotton and Kendall Lamb. These are new guys. We've seen Ed Oliver doing this to the starters. Now you see him doing it to the backups. He is an enforcer in the interior with low center of gravity. 6'1", about 290. Great quickness. Got to go for it. He's got 20 minutes left in regulation. You're down by 21 points, fourth and four. Pressure to a step. He's a rookie out of Kentucky. Actually went to three schools, Temple, Vandy, and Kentucky. Had 1,000 yards at all three stops. So it gives you an idea of what he can do. I think he'll be a nice compliment as this year goes on to James Cook and Ty Johnson. Could be very physical. Kind of a low center gravity thumper. 5'8", about 220. Samuel sets up bottom of the screen. now you got the pass over the middle and it's caught in traffic Shakira and here comes a flag at the end of the play was second and 11 McDaniel obviously indicating which way he wants it to go unnecessary roughness defense number 21 15-yard penalty from the end of the run. Automatic first down. Well, that's the former Bill and current Dolphin, Jordan Poyer. Helmet to helmet there. In comes the flag. And 15. I'd like to bring Terry in on this. Terry, not just a personal foul. You see anything more than that on that replay? I don't. It looks like he is forcible helmet to helmet contact. but I don't think that they're going to extend this to a disqualification. Great job of holding on to the football. I'm telling you, Shakir is the real deal in the slot for these guys. Gray Davis is still in the back now. Samuel goes in motion. Here goes Davis. And the man who went to three separate schools takes it to the 42-yard line following Deion Dawkins, who is no stranger to go into the Pro Bowl, number 73, their left tackle. Well, Joe Brady doing a very nice job of mixing up the looks. Not putting it all on the shoulders of Josh Allen. Letting the game come to Josh Allen. Mixing up formations. Running the football. Second and two. That was the defensive alert. That player does come. But still through the middle goes Ray Davis. Doing it on the ground. Takes it to the 31. And a first down for the Bills. Yeah, like I said, in talking to him this week, watching Ray Davis in college, and I think Joe Brady's very excited again what he can bring. James Cook already is one of the more underrated backs in the country. He was in college at Georgia, and now he is, I think, in the NFL taking over. But when you can have two or three guys firing, especially on a night like this with the humidity as high as it is, it's great. Temperature in the mid-80s, humidity also in the mid-80s. Dancing and nothing doing there. Taken down by David Long. Making it second and long. The thing I was just about to say is, we a lot of times get caught up in all the quarterbacks and the skill, but this offensive line on the road, doing a pretty good job with pass protection, moving people around, opening up some holes. That time, nice play by the Dolphins, but for the most part, holding their own here in this first half. The Bills had, one of the few teams in the league, He had all five offensive linemen start every game last year, but they had to make a couple of changes this year. They moved McGovern from guard to center, and David Edwards, the former Ram, is now a starter, and a lot of action up front and three flags. That's on Spencer Brown, and that's Buffalo's first penalty. Miami's been flagged four times. Yeah, Miami walked a lot of people up there, kind of flinching, not crossing into the neutral zone, but just showing some anticipation that they're about to come, and Spencer Brown ends up losing it, costing five yards. Second down and 16. Allen fires over the middle. Short pick up there. David Long is right there. Shakir the receiver gain of three harder and three third and 13 halfway through the second quarter Low snap. Dancing. Looking downfield. Firing downfield. Caught at the two-yard line. Back-to-back games to start this season. And Buffalo wins it handily. They had a big lead at the half. 24-10. Added 7-3. and on their way. It was a crazy game. Another touch back here. We all went back and were looking at some of the memories from that game and it was fun to watch you kind of relive some of those. A lot of crazy plays in that game. It was a wild card game really for the ages and it was so interesting because Jimmy Johnson was the head coach and you had the Buffalo Bills trying to Once again, you know, remember, this is the 90s. So in the 90s, they were good. Here they come again. Went to four straight Super Bowls. Didn't win any, but trying to get back there. And, of course, Miami only got the one Super Bowl with Marino. That was an 84. Buffalo, gain of two here as they start this drive with a quick run. We go to Kaylee. Well, guys, we just saw the Bills' only other captain besides Josh Allen. That would be Darrell Bernard. Head into their locker room after a quick visit inside the Blue Medical Tent on the sideline. When he exited the tent, he was holding onto his left shoulder. You can see him walking in right there. Not yet, though, to the x-ray rim. So keep that in mind. That would be a very big loss. Second down and seven. Allen looks one way, then the other. Throws over the middle. A little short of the first down there. Shakir making the tackle, setting up a third and one. That's a huge potential loss here with Bernard. He's kind of taken over as he out for that defense. You have two new safeties, Karen Johnson and Nickel, who's become one of the better communicators and leaders. He's out tonight. Cam Lewis in. And now Bernard walks in to the locker room. If you're a Bills fan, I know you're already concerned about the injuries. And now seeing that is not good. Without question. Second on his shoulder. Third down and one now for Buffalo. Ty Johnson, third down back. Number 26 in the game. Allen drops it under pressure. Escapes. Keeps his eyes downfield. Fires. Knocked away. So on a third and one, dropped it. Phileas Campbell got his hands on it at six feet eight. Fourth and one. Naturally, people are going to wonder about the glove or the hand. I just think he just drops the ball out. You could see the glove, the two fingers there trying to bring the ball in. But what a tough time for that to happen for Josh Allen and for Buffalo on third and one and a shot to try to get that first down and keep this drive moving. Went for it on fourth down the last time Of course they were deep in Miami territory You got Sam Martin Now in his 12th season in the league Out of Appalachian State Berrios back To take the kick Calls for the fair catch and makes it at the 16 yard line From where Miami Begins Sleep is a foreign concept For some of our Friends Pulled at the 60-yard line. Coming up on the pistol a lot about half the time. And he hands the ball off to H&M, gain of one. It's fun to watch, too, and run this offense with Mike McDaniel. Really an extension of what they like to do and just good command. You know, you watch him tonight with the ball handling, how comfortable he is, trying to time up, you know, whether it's a pass or a run, just no look there. He's just trying to affect the defense as much as he can with different ways of carrying out fakes and using his eyes, using his movement with his shoulders. Dolphins running their 18th play. A little toss here. Here comes Hill. Tyreek Hill. First down. And a couple more before he is forced out of bounds by DeMar Hamlin. And it's so great to see Hamlin back. Of course, you all know the story, the cardiac arrest in Cincinnati and that wild game at the end of the season in 2022, fighting for his life. And here he is. He started last week, which is great. Yeah, it really is. And you talk to Buffalo, the coaches and the players, they look at DeMar Hamlin as he's playing safety, you know, and in a big role because of the losses of Micah Hyde and Jordan Poirier, who's now here in Miami. He and Taylor Rapp have big shoes to fill. Tua back. Tua has tie. Overthrows. Intercepted at the 50. And that's Benford with the pick. Bad throw. Too high sailing. And Tua now with two picks in the opening frame. And the biggest concern for Miami is not Tyree Kill and Jalen Waddle. With Odell Beckham down, it's finding that third receiver. We saw Grant DePose not on the same page earlier. Now it's chosen here. It's more of a vertical threat. just not on the same page. Tua likes to anticipate, get the ball out early, and here he and 84 just not on the same page and an easy interception that time for Benford with his eyes on the football. Had a pick last year in the last game of the season, which they'll mark it at the one-yard line. So Allen extends the play. Ty Johnson is the third down back. Normally stays in the block. Send him out in the pattern. Find him at the one-yard line. Any time 17 takes off, seems like he's always going to his right. What a great job. Look to the back right at Ty Johnson not giving up and doing his job as far as from shallow going downfield down that right sideline just to give him that option just in case. And Miami loses Ty Johnson. That was Jalen Ramsey there in coverage. First and goal from the one-yard line. Into the end zone, walking into the end zone. James Cook for the touchdown. So the Buffalo Bills, who have owned the Dolphins, 11 wins in their last 12 meetings, now ready to take what would be a 10-point lead with the extra point. Eight plays, 85 yards, and quickly in four and a half. Yeah, they hit some big plays. They got a penalty, moved the ball right down the field. Josh Allen being Josh Allen. Scrambling there on that big third down to make that throw to Ty Johnson and get him down inside the five. What a drive. Bass for the extra point. And the Buffalo Bills on the road have a 10-point lead with 6.25 remaining in the first half. on Thursday night football next week. So, yeah, 17 seconds. Back-to-back trips to New York. Yeah, we'll have the Giants and the Cowboys the following week. So Bass now to kickoff, and here we go. And so much for the dynamic kickoff, which is totally fizzled tonight. Five kickoffs, five touchbacks. Yeah, for the people that may be just tuning in, Tua has been off to a rough start in this first half, not able to get that rhythm going that you typically see with he, Mike McDaniel, and the receivers. Buffalo's doing a good job of playing zone, sitting back, forcing him to have to go to other options besides Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddell, and they just haven't been on the same page. You see the interception. They did have a touchdown on a 10-play drive that they had to earn, but the two interceptions, Mike McDaniel talked about his mental toughness. It's being tested right here. Start from the 30-yard line, start on the ground Start with a great gain here by HN Picks up 17, takes it out to the 47-yard line Stopped there by Hamlin, first down Great block by the right tackle, Austin Jackson To just kind of open this up, clean it up See also the left guard, Robert Jones, coming around But that hole opened up in a hurry And it's good to see HN have a chance to hit downhill in a hurry under six to play in the half first down at the 47 yard line through the middle again nice tough run here across the 50 he goes to the 48 yard line of the bills second down as specter involved in that tackle he and dorian williams holding it down on the inside with Bernard out of this football game. So far, Mike McDaniel in Miami not able to take advantage, trying to affect the communication. They do a lot of pre-snap movement, try to make the defense have to adjust on the fly, especially on a short week. But Buffalo holding up so far in this game. Second and five. Again, nice little move there. A little short of the first. You know, with McDaniel, we had him each of the last two years. I've done this. I've done the NFL for 39 years. He is a bird of a very different feather. I know you were asking me, can I relate anybody? Can I say anybody was like him? No. And I think I've known every coach in the league for four decades. He's different. I mean, you always see his interviews. We had him just with me and you and Kaylee and our team. And, you know, I don't think he wanted to leave. He didn't want to leave. No. I think he was just enjoying hanging out, talking football. A thousand percent. Third and one. Talking about everything, actually. Up back, and this time he gets stuck. That's Ingold, who has his second carry, his first result in a first down. But not this time. That's Dorian Williams right there. So it's fourth down. Fourth down at the 45-yard line. That's a loss of one. Fourth and a deuce. Watch Dorian Williams. We just talked about Bernard's not in there. Who's going to step up? That's who's going to step up. Dorian Williams, who's got great speed, almost built like a safety, but plays that linebacker spot. And with Bernard down, the question is, can they get separation? That's what they're known for. Is their ability to separate from tight coverage, whether it's Waddle or Tyreek Hill. Bill's taking those two, trying their best to take those away. Makes you wonder if Jonu Smith, the tight end who was acquired, came over this year, if they could get him in this area with his size, 6'3", 250, try to get him to football. Miami playing with a new quarterback, a new left tackle, and a new left guard. Bills say, hey, you think you've got problems? So do we. But the Bills have been able to withstand it. Fourth and goal. Thompson, he slips and down he goes. 15-yard line and Von Miller after that 14-game drought. In his 14th year at the age of 35, now has sacks in back-to-back games with 2.40 to go in the third. 31 to 10, Bills. For Cook, 82 total yards, three touchdowns, two on the ground, one in the air. That Bills defense 17 points off three turnovers. And then on top of all of that, there goes Stewart back to the locker room, leaving on that last series. So they turn it over on downs. Long night for Mike McDaniel at this point. He's down by 21, and the Bills have the ball. From the 15-yard line. He's starting to use some of the clock right now. And that good run game continues. Cook, gain of eight. Let's go back and look at this sack. Von Miller told us yesterday on our call with him, the way I win now is get off. I always won with get off, but especially now, because he said, I don't want to wrestle at 35 years old with these big guys. That time it was just speed around the edge of the right tackle, Austin Jackson, on that fourth down play. Great to see him still with that motor, still with that intensity. One of the great guys in the league for a long time. Won the Super Bowl MVP award with Denver. Won another ring with the Rams two years ago. concluding his career possibly at Buffalo. This will be a first down here. So we were talking to Miller yesterday and looking him up and some of the things about his life. And I said, wait a minute. You majored in poultry science at Texas A&M? What got you into poultry science? He said, man, he said, I needed to get my GPA up. And I looked at that class, and the average grade was A-. So I studied poultry and poultry science and he actually got to like it a lot. Sure did. I mean, I think that's become a thing for him to this day. He loves it. You're breaking down different chicken. Kentucky Fried Popeyes, you know, Chick-fil-A. Eat some all. Gain a one here. Cooked once more to Kaylee. Guys, the Dolphins tell us Tua Tungabailo will not return to this game. He has been ruled out with a concussion. They were able to determine that just six minutes after he left the field and went into the locker room. A little irony there. He got hit by DeMar Hamlin, who, you know, that history. It was legal, the whole thing, but it's unfortunate. The only good thing for the Dolphins now is they get a mini bye week so they don't have a game for 10 days. Give him a chance to pass the protocol. We'll find out, obviously. Second down and nine. Breaking a tackle here. Fighting his way. Extra yardage is Dalton Kincaid. And that might take us, in all likelihood, will to the end of the third quarter. I think we're getting a real feel who Buffalo is going to be this year. playing with great intensity on defense. Josh Allen not looking and forcing the ball to Stephon Diggs to try to make big plays. He's 12-17 for 126 yards. I mean, they're winning with defense, turnovers, and playing smart on offense. No question. After 3, 31-10. The owner of the team, and Chris is the general manager, and it's been that kind of a night. Meanwhile, nice little run here for the Pagula family. There is Terry. and of course his daughter was sensational in the U.S. Open getting to the final where she wound up losing but a tremendous run for her, Jessica. Long makes the tackle here in fourth down so pretty good. I mean he's got the Bills on their way to being 2-0. Daughter goes to the finals of the U.S. Open and we'll see about the Buffalo Sabres. He owns the Sabres in the National Hockey League. Pretty good run right now. He's going to run for the first down and takes a shot. At the six-yard line. Hamlin hit him. And Tua down. Mmm. Picked up the first. Split the seam. But pays the price. Now the backup quarterback is Skyler Thompson. Meanwhile, they look at Tua. Dolphins taking a knee at the moment. back at the 15-yard line as they attend to him. Here it is again. Shot from Hamlin right there. Down he goes. And assisted off the field with a slight limp. Of course, we all remember a few years ago, that was a big concern in his career. A few years ago, he balked up to try to protect himself. this year he's actually down 14 pounds much slimmer to try to be able to move around well you watched him for years and sometimes he can run a little recklessly I feel like he is a little reckless when he runs and he doesn do it often But that would have been a slide. You'd love to see him, especially with his safety coming towards him. He already had the first down. Just slide, you know, feet first, get down to protect your body. On one hand, you admire him, his determination. But on the other hand, he's such an important part of what this team is about and who they are. He'd love to have seen that slide there to get down. But I'm just glad to see him up and walking off the field. Yeah, no blue tent. They'll figure him right back to the locker room. That was a fourth down play. So he keeps the drive alive. Skyler Thompson, who actually played in a playoff game between these two teams, and didn't play particularly. I mean, he was okay in that game even though they lost. Seventh-round pick, Kansas State played in a wild-card game two years ago against the Bills. Can run the ball. Yes, he can. This time he gives it to HN, who actually started to stumble. And Vanessa, with the tackle, K. What you got? Guys, let's put this into context. Chua did not miss a start last year, but during the 2022 season, he experienced two known concussions. He was evaluated for a head injury week three against the Bills, but then returned to the game. And one game later, he exhibited textbook concussion symptoms and was taken off the field by an ambulance in Cincinnati. The controversy prompted the NFL to change its concussion policy. And then in week 16, another concussion cost him the rest of that 2022 season. Yeah, we remember it well. That was a Thursday night game in Cincinnati. Through the middle, stuffed again, nothing happening there. A-Chan hit as he tries to cross the line, and Tua going back to the locker room. We're all thinking about Tua and hope for the best there, especially with the history that he had that Kaylee just talked about from a couple years ago. But with Skyler Thompson and Mike McDaniel now still trying. They need a touchdown on this drive. Three minutes to go into third quarter. Very different now. Buffalo doesn't fear until Thompson makes them pay for it. They're not fearing on those early downs the threat of the throw. See if he can get the ball to Tyree Kill. He's on the left side there. Thompson was a seventh-round pick two years ago out of Kansas State. Hangs in the pocket. Floats one into the end zone, not even close. Berrios was closest, and it's fourth and goal. Yeah, Berrios lost his footing. You talked earlier about it midfield, but we did have some rain earlier this afternoon. I don't know how slick that field is, but he lost his footing, and that ball never had a chance. But this is four-down territory, 243 to go in the third quarter, down by three scores. They need a touchdown here. Thompson started that game in the playoffs two years ago because Tua was hurt, and Teddy Bridgewater, who was the backup, was also hurt. Fourth and goal. Three receivers set to the left and all kinds of movement up front. Second choice timeout. Well, Miami had to take an early timeout. Now they're down to just one. 239 remaining in the third. Schuyler Thompson in his third year out of Kansas State, you can see some of the experience that he had going back to the two years ago when he was in the wild card game against the Bills because of the injury to Tua. So he does have some experience in some big games. Like I said, he can create if he gets pressured. He has the athletic ability to pull away from pressure, does a good job keeping his eyes downfield and can throw the foot now that he's on. He's got to be very, very, very pleased. There were some question marks about this football team with so many new faces. And here they are up 21 on the road week two against a divisional opponent. Sam Martin. Sent it skyward, Berrios moves over, lets it bounce, and it skids into the end zone. Early fourth quarter. Back in 30 seconds. T-Mobile savings, take one. Guys, focus. Let's not do fake falls. Just say, at T-Mobile, you get tons of benefits, and you can still save versus the other guys. Happy to be here. No fake stares, please. Hi, I'm Patrick J. Adams. Is that a shimmy? Just say, at T-Mobile, you can save on every plan, and you get great benefits with Magenta Status. Keep doing whatever that is. I'll do the line. Check out the T-Mobile savings calculator to see how much you can save. And right now, we'll even pay off your phone when you switch. Do-do-do-do-do. So the Dolphins have it. They're down 31 to 10. Skylar Thompson in for the rest of the night. He was inactive in every game last season, played in that wild card game back in 2022 and hasn't played since. Got sacked on a fourth down play. The last time he had the ball starts to strive from the 20-yard line. Puts downfield. Checks down off to the side. Minimal gain there for HN. tackled by Benford, had an earlier interception second and long. They called that play earlier down in the red zone and scored a touchdown on that. This time, Buffalo in a much better position to defend that. Benford just gets off of that block by Engel. Remember, they have Miami not only playing with a backup quarterback, but you have a backup left tackle still and you have a backup left guard. So, meanwhile, you're down by 21 in obvious passing situations. And a guy who hasn't played since 2022 at the helm. Throws caught first down. Been a busy night for H.N. Of course, in the absence of Mostert, H.N. getting an extra dose of duty tonight. He's carried the ball 21 times and caught five. Well, Josh Allen can smile. Good enough night for him. Numbers won't light him up, but that defense has been sensational. About to go 12-1 in the regular season, 13-1 overall against this team and his career. Josh in his seventh year and should be right now in the prime of his career. Thompson hangs in the pocket, throws. Nothing happening there. Good coverage. Dubose was the intended receiver. So, Alan, of course, we were talking to him last night. I always enjoy the fact that he grew up in the Central Valley, Valley of California, in a town called Fireball, 8,000 people. They're known as the Cantaloupe capital of the world. They have the Cantaloupe Festival. But he's never been the Grand Marshal. I mean, who in the hell is the Grand Marshal? He's 17. Yeah, right. We were asking him about getting up at 4 in the morning as, you know, son of a farmer. and he said, man, my dad basically said, the only way you're not getting up early and helping me out is if you're playing sports. He said, me and my brother, we play football, baseball, basketball, soccer, any sport we could find. Yeah, good idea. Who wants to schlep cantaloupes around? Caught at the 40. After the 43 goes John O'Smith. But we don't. Yeah, he said he's graduated from contributing, helping out. Right. At this point. Owns the farm. Third and four. And that's too high and incomplete. Well, what can I tell you, folks? You know, if you're showing a form, you know what it is. You know what it is. It's a 31-10 ball game. Why don't we go to Vaughn Miller? Because, again, to get off here against Austin Jackson, he doesn't get the sack. He comes close. And I think just the fact, just his presence there, sometimes, again, it's not about the sack. It's just making that quarterback feel you. and I think he saw him get off quickly, knew that he had to get that ball out in a hurry and I think he affected the quarterback and ended up affecting the accuracy of that throw. Fourth and four have to go for it from the 42 and he got a whistle here. Oh, sorry. Offset to the 74. Roger Apelli, go fourth down. I can turn a fourth and four into a fourth and nine. And they'll still go for it. Deep, deep drop. Everybody covered. Running around. He's going to run for the first half, but will not get there. And he's tackled there by Greg Russo, who comes off a three-sack game last week. So they turn it over on down. So not only are they keeping those two safeties back to prevent any shots, they're playing man coverage underneath that, which allows them to run and disrupt the timing with Jalen Wallow and Tyreek Hill. It's just been a great night for Buffalo in every phase of the game. Down here in Miami, week two. When he's gotten the football, he's got the three touchdowns. You can see over 39 yards from what's been expected of him because of not just missed tackles, but also the way he's been able to shake a lot of these Miami defenders. So a homecoming of sorts for James Cook. Grew up in this area, went up to Georgia to college. Older brother Dowman Cook's got to be watching. His mom is here. So a big night for James Cook and his Bills team. Great first half. Built that big lead. The third time that Buffalo has started a drive after stopping Miami on fourth down. And time to use the clock here. Moving forward, gain of about four yards there. Davis will go to Kaylee. Guys, after seeing the Dolphins left tackle Teron Armstead in and out and in and out of the game, he's now in the Dolphins' locker room heading into the X-ray room. And just before he did, he gave Tua Tungabalayo's brother a hug as he sits outside of that locker room waiting for the quarterback to emerge. Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, injury to insult right now. And I, everything going wrong for Miami on a night when they were actually favored by a couple of points. But it's been all Buffalo, and a lot of it has to do with that defense, clearly. 30-second timeout. You know, the Bills have had their way, really haven't had to rely on this new room of wide receivers with Gabe Davis no longer here, Stephon Diggs no longer here. So, you know, it's going to be at some point, obviously, they're going to go up into a game, and Josh Allen's going to have to be able to rely on this new group. There's last year's receivers. You see Shakir there with the 39 receptions. Everybody else is gone. So it's an entire new group. Shakir comes back. Keon Coleman, a rookie out of Florida State. Mack Hollins comes over, kind of the veteran of the group, kind of setting the tone in that room. Curtis Samuel is kind of a guy that can do a lot of different things. Marquez Valdez-Scantling is a guy that's played in so many big games with Green Bay and Kansas City. So I'm kind of excited to see what they can become, along with the two tight ends, Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox. Yeah, they really haven't had a chance to show their stuff yet. As Davis stopped there. Meanwhile, Coleman, they picked Coleman in the second round. They actually traded down with Kansas City to let Kansas City pick in front of them. A lot of good receivers in Kansas City went for one of them as well. Pretty good opening night for him, huh? No doubt. No doubt about that. You know, you go back to that draft. I thought Miami, of all teams, would get, wouldn't it be fitting Xavier Worthy, who they had a shot at to get with all that speed? be able to take the top off of a defense like this tonight when they face that cover two look. And they went for the big 6-4 rookie out of Florida State. Allen throws and it's caught. We'll pad his stat sheet a little bit. Shakir, as we say, the only guy who caught a pass from Allen coming into this season for a first down as we tick down to 10 minutes. And it brought both the inside linebackers, Brooks and David Long. This is one of the few times that Josh Allen has felt any pressure, but he does a heck of a job of sensing it, feeling it, falling back, and then locating that open receiver. The guy that's going to emerge this year, everyone is going to be 10. I mean, all these other guys are pieces. They kind of fit like a jigsaw puzzle. I think Shakir is going to have a monster year with Josh Allen this year. Ray Davis. Again, you know, you think about the move they made in the offseason, and, you know, it's not often you trade away somebody of Diggs' caliber. Because you look at that four-year period there, most completions in the league, most receiving yards, time for the most touchdowns. So they send him to Houston, and then Davis winds up. As you see, Brandon Bean, the GM, the architect of those deals, Davis decides to leave town as well. And a lot of the fans, I think, were thinking, you know, what are we doing here? Yeah, but if you look at where they've been the last couple years in the playoffs, they needed to shake things up, you know. And I think that the idea around this, when you let go of a superstar like that, is there's a tendency to want to find ways to always get that superstar the ball. You know, and when you lose that element, I think now you have Joe Brady as an offensive coordinator who can say, you know what, we're not going to rely on one guy. We're going to read the coverage and let the defense dictate where the football is going to go. Whoever's open is going to get the ball. One game you might have one catch. The next game you might have ten catches. It's just how the defense plays will dictate the read and allow Josh Allen to work through the progressions. I think it could work out well. And they've become more reliant upon the tight ends in Kincaid and Knox. He targeted ten different guys. I'll tell you what it reminds me of, Kirk, timeout called here by Buffalo. You know, you trade away a megastar. It's what Kansas City did when they got rid of Tyreek Hill. And everybody said, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We've got Mahomes coming into his prime. As fast a guy in the league, you know, a total game record. Well, how did it work out? It worked out pretty well for Kansas City, didn't it? Yeah. And I think it frees up this offense as a whole. I mean, Stephon Diggs is a generational talent. He's a superstar. I'm sure he'll do great things in Houston. But it's really about trying to see where they can go as a unit. And I think the potentials, you're going to see them rely more on the running game. How about the job the offensive line did tonight on the road? Controlled things for the most part up front. Took some of the pressure off of Josh Allen and those receivers. They won the turnover margin. I think it's going to be a Sean McDermott kind of team. Defense, turnover margin, field position, and Josh Allen not feeling like he has to always be a hero and always feel like he has to win the game. They'll be those moments, but not every week. Third and 11. Allen on the run, and Allen is able to throw before he goes out of bounds and it's broken up. Pass intended. That's Keon Coleman finally through his way tonight. the rookie number one pick. Then it's fourth and 11. Josh Allen, pretty fortunate there. Again, he always seems to run to his right, gets rid of the ball right before he gets to the sideline and up and over the athletic ability and the vert to get up and over that bench. Big fella can climb the ladder. Ronaldo Nehemiah lives again. Tyler Bass no good so Miami gets even any break for what it's worth with four pressures 2.1 average time to pressure fastest since going back to 2021 which was before the ACL he tried to play last year just gutted out wasn't clearly the same since that injury. Now he looks like his old self. This is just going to be a game on so many levels that Miami's going to want to put behind them and move on. Obviously, we think about Tua and his health and where they'll go from here. Armstead, the left tackle's out with an injury. You've got a backup left guard, backup left tackle, backup quarterback. Also eight penalties against the Dolphins tonight and one against Buffalo. I think a bigger story tonight, besides the injuries, is other teams within this division and other opponents are seeing what Jacksonville did last week. They're seeing what Buffalo did tonight. And they're saying, okay, here's what we're going to do when we go against this Miami offense. We're going to keep everybody in front. We're going to not give up those big plays. We're going to play man under with two safeties deep. We're going to jam Tyreek Hill. Make them find somebody else besides Waddle and Hill. Make them run the football. Toss to the outside. And out of bounds goes Jalen Wright. Let's take a look at that Miami schedule now with Tua in the concussion protocol. They have 10 days, but that's a long trip. It doesn't get any longer when you go from Miami to Seattle. Then they come back. That's where you attack. Split them. Ball's got to get out early over the linebacker between the safeties. Came close to getting that touchdown. Second and ten. And it's caught at the 15. Secured there by Smythe. Well, you know, one way to keep an audience in a blowout game like this there is something in play, right? I believe there is. One thing's not. The other thing. The line is not in play here tonight. However, at 41 points, a few hearts were beating rather rapidly when that pass was dropped in the end zone. It's not over yet. If you had a two-point conversion, it would have been, oh, never mind. Third and two. Thompson fires, and it's broken up at the goal line. It's Benford again. He's had a busy night. Well, these corners have played great football tonight. You know, they're both big. Benford is 6'1", 205, third year out of Villanova. I think a lot of people, when he and Elam were drafted together, they thought Elam as an early draft pick would win that job, But Benford last year became the guy and continues this year. That's the look at Elam. And on the other side, Rasul Douglas. Both guys have played well. Douglas out of the game at this point with Elam in. So fourth and two. Thompson, pressured, throws, broken up in the end zone. Intended for Robbie Chosen, who was the chosen one on that route, but broken up in the end zone. and they'll turn it over on down. You're going to love this guy that broke up this play. He's a rookie out of Utah, Cole Bishop. Makes a great play here on the football. See him, gives him a little bit of a cushion, but because he locates the football early, it allows him to go up and time that to be able to knock it away. I thought he might go up and try to intercept it. He's a ball hawk. Plays coming out of that program with Kyle Whittingham. Great, aggressive program and made a heck of a play. They picked him in the second round out of Utah. Remember, they lost both safeties. Boyer came here. Micah Hyde still hasn't been signed. And, of course, tonight playing without Johnson. So one of the things in the draft, not only did they need a receiver, but they're looking for a safety, and they wound up with Bishop. It's a big win for Buffalo. You can see the emotion. It's only week two. It's like, okay, it's a long way to go, but it's a division matchup. And I think it was just more the challenge to try to come down here. Josh told us last night in our meeting about he just, I don't know what it is about Miami, but I just play with a great deal of confidence. He's now 13-1 against them. Yeah, well, Trubisky's going to wrap it up. He hands to Davis, and he'll play the final couple of minutes with 1.57 to go. And the Bills with a big win. Trying to take it all the way to the finish, and they can likely do that now. Here's the first down from Davis. Okay, Kaylee, what do you know? Guys, Tua is still in the Dolphins' locker room. We're told family is inside with him. We've seen his wife and two children as well as his brother. We're told he is conscious, awake and alert, just as he was when you saw him walking off this field on his own power. We're also told he has full movement in his extremities. Well, that's the good news. We'll see what happens down the line here. Of course, we've already seen enough of when he gets hurt and what that meant a couple of years ago. We were in Cincinnati that night, and that wasn't a career end that I'd give up. Unbelievably, he came back shortly thereafter. A little victory formation, and again, the Buffalo Bills have owned the Dolphins. Look at this. Last 12 games coming in, 11-1, they win tonight. Point differential per game, 14.5. So they've been killing them, not just winning. Turnover differential, total yards per game, you name it. and the only time the Dolphins beat them in this run, they came down here, the Bills in week three, on a hot and sticky night like tonight is, and Miami took the measure of them, but tonight it's like, hey, forget about it. Oh, Buffalo. Yeah, I think a lot of people, especially Miami fans, are going to say, what's wrong with Miami? I think this is a lot about what's right with Buffalo. I think we all, week two, long way to go, but there's a lot to like about this Buffalo Bills team after tonight. A lot. Hill and the gang willing to get an extra day, three days off. Find out what happens when they make that long trip to Seattle a week from Sunday. Von Miller, Saks in Tennessee here, and then at New England. And clearly you're looking at the two best teams in the division, you would think, coming into the season, certainly. Now you've got the Jets, of course, and New England. Who knows? By week comes in week six. Meanwhile, if Thompson has to start, and Tua can't come back, Tim Boyle, who we saw last year with the Jets, he's on the practice squad, so he would be the backup. Unless Marino comes out of retirement. Pass caught, 40-yard line, staying on his feet. A-Chan picks up the first down. Nice numbers tonight for him. He has 53 yards in the air. That's a 16-yard game to go with 90 on the ground. Listen, I don't want to make this bigger deal than it is, but it's 31-10, right? And the offense is on the field. Tyree Kill's done for the night. Jalen Waddell's done for the night. And, you know, there's 15 more games to go, but it's just you'd love to see him up, watching, involved. You know, to me, this is just not just about X's and O's tonight. This is about a Buffalo Bills team that showed up with bad intentions. They showed up and played as a team. They showed up and really, I think, showed the league without Stephon Diggs. This is going to be kind of the little engine that could. They don't have Josh Allen and a bunch of guys, right? And they took the field, lost one of their starters, Bernard, to an injury. Already didn't have Taron Johnson. Cam Lewis was in for him. They're starting two safeties. They're working together for the second time. and they played with a massive chip on their shoulder as a group. And then you see Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddell here with five minutes to go in the game. And it's a very different vibe from what you see on that other sideline. Yeah, it's also the look of a team that's down by 21 points and can't do anything. And there's their quarterback in concussion protocol. Backing up, throwing up his back foot, and it's caught. But A-chan, that big night continues, at least on the stat sheet for him. And that's a first down. You know, statement game is used too much. That's a cliche. But I'll tell you what. Buffalo's making a little early season statement with a bullhorn tonight. No question about that. And I think we're all coming into this game wondering about, okay, Josh Allen. He's dominated Miami. But it's early in September. It's hot. Tua, this offense. Can Buffalo come down here and win this game? And, boy, from word go, they've just beat them at the line of scrimmage. We're going to talk a lot about the offense, but it was really about the defense and the turnovers. And, again, going back to that collective attitude that they played with. Time out. Buffalo, 419. Didn't the Marlins win a World Series in here? They certainly did, because when the Marlins got their expansion franchise and before they built their own stadium, the Marlins played here and did win a World Series in this ballpark. I think that was the Cubs a year down the left field line at Wrigley. If I'm not mistaken. That was in Wrigley, but that was in the playoffs. Yeah, then they ended up beating, I think, the Indians, right? Right. Correct. Correctamundo. Very good. Excellent. Craig Colburn. What was his name? Greg Colburn against Jose Mesa. You're thinking of Craig Kilburn. No, who is it? You know, the second baseman, the little second baseman. For Craig Council. Craig Council. Now a manager, right? Yeah. I think he is. The Cubs. No, now manages the... Charles Johnson behind the plate there. Kenny Hurt, who does he manage? Brewers? There you go. I think he's a Brewers. Or he was. I mean, we're to that point right now. Sorry, folks. Second and 11. Don't get us on base. No. Good to have as Grant Dubose makes the catch. Come on, boys back. Malibu Kelly Hayes coming with you for 100 years in a row. George Hill. Off to the hip surgery. Looking great. Fantastic. Good job, Georgie. Ready for action. Your boys are back as well. Yeah. Darren is back. Tony is back. Looking good. There you go. Nutty just does a whole. Nutty does. She's back. They all went home. I think they left. Three minutes left in the fourth. You got four receivers bunched to the right side. Thompson will fire the end zone. Almost incomplete. Julian Hill tried to make the catch. Good throw here by Thompson in between three defenders. Pretty good. When I think about that seam route, again, I think of Johnnie Smith. but second time they've tried in this area to get the ball to Julian Hill. Almost came down with that one. Gave them a chance here. Again, those split safeties.
