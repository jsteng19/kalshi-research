 Brings a different kind of back, more downhill, more between the tackles than who they were the last few years with Aaron Jones more on the edge, outside zone. That last run took them to 1,000 yards for the season. That'll be the end of the first quarter. Detroit 7, Green Bay nothing. Back to Detroit after these messages. Great news. Yeah. Matt LaFour told us this week he's a severely underrated player. Pressure is put on. Pass has gotten away. Christian Watson with a nice move and then he loses the ball. And for the moment, the Lions have it. He got popped by Carlton Davis. Lost it along the sideline and stays inbounds. And Detroit with the takeaway. Detroit bringing a lot of pressure. They play a lot of man-to-man coverage. Nobody picks up Christian Watson. And this is why you never give up on a play. Cuts back away from Joseph. Watch from behind the crafty veteran. Carlton Davis knocks that ball loose. And the Lions are able to pounce on it. Make sure a knee is off the ground. And it is. Ball is in the air. Detroit football. But they now have blitzed on five of the seven dropbacks. with all these new faces. That time, it's one of the new faces. Jonah Williams, who applied the most pressure in the Lions, talked about turnovers with us all week, and they got one there. And David Long recovered it. Now Goff off the play fake. Fires into traffic, and that is taken in there by the tight end, Sam Laporta. First down. They love these routes over the middle for the defense. Try to pick on those linebackers, put them in conflict. That time it was Clay Walker. Started the run with the tight end down the middle, came off of him, but he came off a little bit late, and Goff was able to squeeze it in there for a nice game. Seven first downs for the Lions, only one for Green Bay. Montgomery destroyed the touchdown. Two to the 39-yard line. A little extra action after the play. You see the flag coming in. You've got Quay Walker involved and Dan Skipper. That's an easy call. Divisional matchup, a rivalry. It's going to get a little heated. And that time Quay Walker lost his cool after he got pushed near the end, near the end of the whistle. After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary reference, defense. Number 7. That 15-year penalty will be in first. And the end of the run. Automatic. Now here's 70. Skipper finishing the play right here. Walker doesn't like it. And then he hits him. And the big fella goes down. That's a big man going down at 6'9". 330. Looks like a big-time wrestler out there. He does. He's huge. I think it's the fourth stint. he's had with the Lions. He's been all over the league. And he bounced all over not only the league and the Lions, but also along the offensive line. He can fill in a lot of different areas. Filling in tonight for Taylor Decker at left tackle. Big toss. Going deep. Down the sideline. Too deep. Incomplete. Good coverage on the play that time. Isaiah McDuffie put the pressure on. Second down and ten. How about David Montgomery just in time? Because I'll tell you, when McDuffie comes in these blitzes, he is coming fast. He got to him one time. This time Montgomery learned from that mistake because he was in before. He sold out. Now give McDuffie credit because he kept fighting through it. But boy, Montgomery stepped right into that blitz from 58. Gibbs is the back. Give it to him. Nothing doing. Smothered at the line of scrimmage. Devontae Wyatt is there third down and ten Devontae Wyatt kind of an underrated underappreciated player throughout really his entire career even when you go back to Georgia there were so many first rounders he ended up being a late first rounder himself but just kind of a forgotten guy had a knee in 23 had an ankle throughout his career there's Van Ness running off into the locker room but I'll tell you now that he's healthy don't be surprised to see 95 the white make some more plays third ten golf under pressure throwing crowd wants a flag will not get one James Williams intended receiver so before it down in ten and comes the field goal group to try to make it ten to nothing actual back to the hills as you would expect Green Bay won the toss they defer and the Lions will get the ball Brandon McManus to kick it off taking a yard into the end zone and down to there by Sione Hivaki so here they come and Jared Goff having a tremendous year when you talk about the MVP race of course you're talking about Saquon Barkley who else are you talking about too you're talking about you got to put Allen yeah yeah Josh Allen Josh Allen and Jared Goff such a a great year in this system And even though Baltimore has had its problems, Lamar Jackson, his numbers would put him in that conversation as well. Yeah, great race this year. Start with David Montgomery as the running back. Go back and forth with him and Jameer Gibbs. And start with the fullback as well. Keep it on the ground. And it's a two-yard pickup here on first down. P.J. Slayton making the tackle. Second down, second and eight. That'll be a good matchup up front at the line of scrimmage with his veteran offensive line going against the Packers. It seems to be getting better each week with this new system that Jeff Halfley brought in. They've been a 3-4 defense for a long time, and right now playing with 4-D linemen in this new 4-3 scheme. Playing much better against the run in recent weeks. Motion here. Short drop. Quick pass. Out to the 37. Come on, Ross St. Brown makes the grab. his 77th catch of the season. Isaiah McDuffie makes the tackle, third and two. I think one of the things that the whole league really appreciates, Ben Johnson, who we'll talk more and more about, is the offensive coordinator, one of the hot names last year and, of course, this year as far as future head coaches. He and Jared Goff, the connection they have, the command that Goff has, especially in these situations, at the line of scrimmage. St. Brown in motion. Looking that way is Goff. Throwing that way is Goff. First down. Back-to-back receptions for St. Brown. Bullard covering on the play. This is the thing that this Lions offense is known for, the movement. How do you get 14 open when you move it? The Packers are expecting him to get involved. They want to get hands on him when you can't when you move him. You can see that soft coverage there allows him to be able to get up and out. Bullard doesn't have any chance, and there's the accuracy, of course, from golf. Play action. Fired over the middle, and St. Brown was there. Could not hold on. Covered on the play by Keyshawn Nixon. Be second down and ten. I think Nixon may have got that left hand in there. You don't see St. Brown drop very many footballs. Again, the accuracy, ball and the money. That left hand did sneak in there. The fans wanted that right arm leaning over top of St. Brown, and a call to be made, but that is a perfectly executed man coverage there by the corner Nixon. Now you've got Williams behind St. Brown on the right side. Second and 10 from the 42. Williams goes in motion. Keep it on the ground. And this time, Montgomery. First down into Green Bay territory. Tackled by McKinney. This is what Montgomery brings to the table with these two backs. You'll see the right guard, 71 and 87, pull around. But the Packers, to their credit, they blow this play up. I mean, Quay Walker gets down there, but that's the physicality. Great block by Jamison Williams. Once he kept his balance, Williams' block out there on the corner sprung him free. But the Packers did everything that they wanted to do there to defend that. But the balance and the strength of the back Montgomery gets him out in the open. Now Jameer Gibbs comes in. He's 27 yards shy of 1,000. makes the grab on the move tackled at the 38 yard line and run he can catch fuller makes that tackle how great is it it's the best tandem of backs in the nfl we already saw montgomery and what he can do with with the power to be able to shake free and then you bring gibbs and it keeps both these guys fresh he gets out into the open field and he is so dangerous that time he didn't even have a chance to use his lineman and still picked up positive yards. Montgomery comes back in. Again a short drop, quick throw, and it's Williams at the first down marker, but incomplete there. Jamison Williams can't hold on, it'll be third down and three. And with Edgerton Cooper out, you're going to see some blitzing here. They've got to try to get pressure on Goff because they've got to find a way to be able to get him off his spot. You can see the back that time's trying to step up and help out. And Montgomery just, you would think the hammer, David Montgomery, would come in there, right? You need some tough yards between the tackle. But no, Gibbs shows you his versatility. Runs through a few arm tackles. Boy, that was close right at the spot. That second effort looks like got him across the line there. Just outside the 20. and now we were thinking, yeah, there's the challenge play so LeFleur is going to challenge that was a third and four so if he wins the challenge, it'll be fourth and inches the thing that I think you'll see in my opinion, Evan Williams, when he first hit him, 33 I think he looked like he was short but when he twisted and then kept moving I think he ended up getting passed for the first down. All right. The challenge, take another look at it. Two and a half to go in the quarter. The verdict when we come back. Green Bay is charged their first time out for an unsuccessful challenge. This is considered their first time. Yeah, it's always a tough challenge to win on a spot like that. But that second effort, spinning around, got him the first down. That was a great look at it, that opposite angle there again, like we keep saying. Patch here, patch. Without that second effort, I don't think he gets it. Gibbs, nothing. Tackle, swaddled up at the line of scrimmage. Kenny Clark, who's been doing yeoman work for nine years, number one pick in 2016 out of UCLA. Second down and ten. Most of his career, he was known as a great pass rusher and also good against the run. There, he gets penetration. Tough to do against Ragnow, the center, but he does it. And what that did is freed the linebackers to be able to get downhill in a hurry with Walker and McDuffie. Second down and ten. To the outsides. Gibbs. Says on his feet. turns nothing into a little something then it'll be third down and five I tell you, Green Bay holding their own it's a line of scrimmage again, this is maybe the best offensive line in the game he had to bounce this outside how about the rookie, Evan Williams who Halfley just loves but there once again is Gibbs showing you he's not just a guy out in space physical runner bouncing off of that hit by Evan Williams didn't wrap up so able to get around him for a few more yards 120 left in the corner third down and five keep it on the ground going nowhere Colby Wooden stops him in his tracks second year guy out of Auburn fourth down and again 77 is one of the best centers in a game he just allays him with quickness they are getting off of the ball at the line of scrimmage in the last two series. They're winning the point of attack up front. And again, very, very tough to do against this Detroit offensive line. The Lions went 70 yards in a little over five minutes for the touchdown. Fox's punt. Flag is thrown. Fair catch is called for and made at the 26-yard line. So John Hussie hustles down. As I say, he's working on two days rest, so you know. Yeah, not easy. No. During the kick, holding, defense, correction, receiving team, 10-yard penalty, first down. All right, she had a 50-yard punt and 10 more to come. and we are back. 35 seconds left in the first quarter. Lions on top, 7-0. Lions trying to win their 11th game in a row. Jacobs and Brooks are both in the backfield. Jacobs. He's had a great season. Chris Brooks leading the way. It'll be second down and three. He sure has. We haven't had a chance yet to talk much about him. Aaron Jones goes to Minnesota. And Josh Jacobs, you know, the Las Vegas Raiders, we had them last week. I know they wanted to hold on to him, but he leaves, comes to Green Bay. Looking for room. Threading his way. Nice move. So about the one and a half goes Josh Jacobs second down and goal. I'm with you, Al. That little hesitation allowed Josh Myers to be able to stay on his block and got him to be able to kind of wiggle through for more yards. This play potentially blown up. Watch the center. 71, little hesitation. Gets underneath that. And again, he's able to shake through. He's one of the best backs in the NFL with yards after contact. In fact, he's third in the league. And that time, good job of showing his vision to be able to get some positive great yards. Six minutes to halftime. Second and goal. Jacobs again. A fake to him, and then Tucker Kraft was the intended receiver. It's incomplete. Third down and goal. What a call. Defense had their eyes in the backfield and locked in on Josh Jacobs. He's able to slip Kraft out. Good time to call it. Kraft does a good job of selling it. See the eyes of 32. Branch, he just needed to put a little air under this and float it out there. It's an easy touchdown and just sails on him. Missed opportunity for the Packers on that one. Said third down and goal. Love. Under pressure. And that's a flag in the end zone. For the moment, it's taken by Davis. But let's see about the call in the end zone. So for the moment, the Lions think they have it. But you look at Arnold's expression, and that may tell you speed volumes anyway. We'll see. Campbell wants to know, so do we. They got the rookie, Terryon Arnold, man-to-man against Watson on that back line. It looked like Watson was trying to work back to his quarterback to our left Arnold was already pleading his case Before Davis picked up the ball So with five and a half to go Penalized to pass in the finish 17 times A couple of times tonight That's the most in the league And that's the third first down for Green Bay tonight by penalty. Two on this drive. First and goal. Can he get into the end zone? Yes, he can. Jacobs for the touchdown. Not the prettiest drive we've ever seen. No. But very effective. Ten runs, two passes. You don't see that very often on a 12-play drive. And on this drive, average 6.5 yards per carry. They ran the football. They turned it over after getting down 10. They didn't panic. They turned it over to the offensive line, and they turned it over to the guy that's really been carrying them in that backfield, Josh Jacobs, and it pays off with that touchdown. Jacobs, 49 yards in the half. Brandon McManus, who for the moment has solved Green Bay's kicking problems. Longtime Denver Bronco. Boots that one through. And with five and a half to go in the half, it's Detroit 10, Green Bay 7. And for Jared Goff, a guy who, you know, certainly had his confidence shook when he got traded for Matthew Stafford. Of course, that worked out very well for the Rams, but it's now working out extremely well for the Lions. So both teams are going to wind up with what they wanted. Yeah, and I think really, Al, I think because of what happened with Stafford and the Rams, it really intensified the trade and almost the mocking, I think, is the way some of the reaction towards Goff. I think that's how he took it. And I think he gets here. They get off to a slow start with him. Things aren't going well. Meanwhile, the Rams are the bell of the ball. Everybody's talking about Sean McVay and Matthew Stafford. So I think it made him feel even more pain. But you know what they did? They built a heck of a team around him. And like you said, these last two and a half years, playing about as well as anybody in this league. Yeah, well, the Rams went all in in 21 to win a Super Bowl in their home stadium, and they pulled it off a nine-yard. First and goal. Clock running down to 115. Running back is Montgomery. Give it to him. Finding his way. Just a little short. To the one or even inside. Second and goal. Timeout taken by Green Bay. With 60 seconds left. Good decision. Green Bay gets the ball. It's the second half. Brought to you by State Forum. second and goal from the two gosh keeping himself and take it two no signal yet now there is touchdown had to come in and get a closer look at it he called off of the play that they had he saw that gap over the left shoulder of the center. And he let everybody know he was going to keep it. Made the good decision. Oh, he's short. He is short. So, one official comes in from the side. After a long wait, there's your... There's the knee. The knee is down. Ball is not across the goal line. Great look here. There's the knee down. He's short. When replay changes in aspect of the play, we must run 10 seconds. Green Bay has elected to use their last timeout in lieu of the 10-second runoff. Third and final charge timeout, Green Bay. Right, so they took two on this drive and one. It cost them one when they missed the challenge. It's not overturned, so it's third down and goal now from inside the one-yard line. Meanwhile, Dan Campbell, one of the things he mentioned to us is the onus is on our offense. with the injuries we have and the new faces on that side of the ball this week. Not only are we trying to score points, we're trying to eat clock, and they have a five-minute time of possession advantage in this first half alone. So they're keeping Jordan Love on the sideline this first half, keeping him out of rhythm. Third and that much. Montgomery is in there. They're resetting the game clock Is what's going on right here They're going to set it to one minute That's the reason for the Delay here There you go Just for the moment Time is standing still Now we're good 60 seconds, third down and goal Montgomery. The running back. He's already been into the end zone tonight. And he'll get stuck at the one. Kenny Clark is there. So it's going to be fourth down and goal. This is the danger against having a guy like Kenny Clark. He's going up against the center rack now. you'll see him get off the ball and work with that power into that backfield and frees up those backers as well. Sean Gary able to come off the edge helped clean that up so they lose about a yard and a half. So it's fourth and goal. Green Bay does get the ball back to the next to no time. Ready to take a timeout here they just wait for the clock to run down. And they take the timeout and will stop with 14 seconds. and a fourth and goal. Huge play in this one. Green Bay's going to get the ball to start the second half. Well, this is where you would assume they're keeping their offense out in the field. You would assume with a veteran quarterback who sees the field so well, processes quickly, you know, you would think Green Bay will bring some pressure. You've got to rely on your offensive line, and you've got to find a way to create a matchup for St. Brown, 14, Or 87, LaPorta. Down here, that's where they can win if they can find a matchup that's favorable. Now they've got Gibbs in the backfield. Does Goff try to sneak it in again? He hasn't scored a rushing touchdown this season. Had a temporary one. 12th play of this drive. Backs up. Throws. Touchdown. To Gibbs. Won the toss, deferred, and Detroit says thank you very much. Well, what a drive. What a way to open this up here in Detroit. Love knows what he's facing tonight. Third and two, third and three, third and goal. Able to be able to keep that drive alive. And when in doubt you get in that area, get behind 58. The right tackle is Sewell. And a heck of a lock from Tim Patrick, the receiver, as well. 12th rushing touchdown of the season for David Montgomery. Jake Bates for the point after. Fox did a nice job on that snap. Getting it down. Pick is good. Montgomery to the end zone. 7-0 Lions. Under Dan Campbell. And from that point on, they have been winning as much as anybody. In fact, them in Kansas City have won the most. Exactly. Half point on. 31-8, the record since they turned things around. Meanwhile, Green Bay will start its drive from the 30-yard line after the Lions have gone 11 plays, 70 yards, in a little over five minutes. Jordan Love, 20 touchdowns, 11 picks. It won in each of the first eight games. First Cousins has 13. He took the lead, the dubious lead, with a four-pick performance last week against the Chargers. But Love, who started the season hurt on opening day in Brazil, missed two games, has had a groin issue as well. It appears to be totally healthy right now. Yeah, from the bye week on the last three games, back to really the Jordan Love you expect to see. Running back is Josh Jacobs, and what a year he is having. Off the play fake. Under pressure. Look out. Sacked at the 23-yard line. play action, that doesn't work and they got Z'Darrius Smith crawling his way with Jamal Adams who just joined the team three days ago also in this is a big storyline because the right tackle, a little bit confused there, Zach Tom looked inside felt some pressure, it freed up Smith to be able to get out on the edge with Aiden Hutchinson down, this Detroit defense has been looking for pressure and Smith now in just five games already has three sacks. Really helping out. Second and 17. Pressure. He's going to run with it. Tripped up at the 31-yard line. Tripped up there by Jack Campbell in his second year. Campbell has the green dot which means he calls the defensive signals and it'll be third down. This game has the feeling. What Aaron Glenn, we talked about in the open, the job he's done this year despite all these injuries. 13 guys on IR. Three more down tonight. Signing four players this week. Just trying to find bodies that are healthy. Imagine some of those guys like you mentioned. Jamal Adams already out there. He's been here four days. And starting tonight, third down and nine. Extra pressure again. Love throws. Incomplete. Looking for a flag. And there is a flag. Jane Reed, the intended receiver, Brian Branch, covering on the play, and there's a flag upfield. These Lions, because they play so much man coverage, they have been called for a lot of defensive holdings and PIs a lot this year. Defense, number 32. While he plays the spot on the foul, automatic. Now you live on an island, and Branch is good when he's near the line of scrimmage, 32. He gives him a cushion. Watch, 32. Inside leverage, and then he gets turned. Once he gets turned, he's beaten, uses that left hand to grab onto him. And officials again all over it with the right call. Yeah, they lead the league in defensive pass interference calls. That's their 16th of the season. First down now. Looking for room, finding none. Josh Jacobs came over as a free agent after playing with the Raiders. Stopped there by McNeil. It'll be second down and nine. With these injuries, you need guys to step up. I mean, DJ Reader's down tonight. You put DJ Reader and Aleem McNeil in the middle. That's as good as there is as far as defending the run. In 54, that play makes a ferocious tackle throwing a blocker and making the play at the line of scrimmage. Now he gets helped off. Yeah, he gets helped off because upstairs they took a look and said, they called down and said, all right, take him out at least for this play. So McNeil will come to the sideline. Watch this play. Watch how physical he gets. I mean, this guy is so strong. Pushes him, maybe holds on, but that power that he has, able to hit some really good look from behind to see that he gets rid of Tom. That's a big lineman he just throws to the ground and then makes the play. Couldn't make the cut there. Second down and nine. Quick throw. Not a lot of room, though. Octavian Wicks was tackled there by Kwon Alexander, another guy who just got into camp. Right. The one thing you've got to say, no matter who's wearing that silver and blue, man, do they run to the football. I mean, it's like a coaching clinic on guys that just, they don't even know what jersey number they're wearing, but they know that they've been taught by Aaron Glenn and Dan Campbell. In fact, we talked to Dan this week, and he said, we don't know who's going to be out there, but they're going to live up to the standard. They're going to run to the football, play through the whistle, and try to get some turnovers. Hello, my name is Jamal. My name is Kwon. Good to meet you. They're out there playing. Name tags. Chris Brooks is the back here. He stays in the block. Love, off balance, throwing and incomplete at the 20-yard line. Fending for Wicks. Love was under pressure. Throwing off his back, flip fourth down. You know, for a team that doesn't necessarily have a great pass rush, they are getting home right now. Ezekiel Turner brought up the blitz 47 right in the middle You also see a good get off there by 95 Pat O'Connor enough to affect Love make him throw that off of his back foot so he loses accuracy on the football Daniel Whelan is the punter Maurice Alexander sets up inside his 10 yard line Fair catch made at the 9 That's where Detroit will begin its second drive with six and a half. Gold, the Porta in motion, blows it up there. Zylstra, nice job. Even the receiver, Tim Patrick. Sewell, the right tackle. So not only the touchdown, but trying to send a message there to this Packers defense. Start this drive from the eight-yard line, three tight ends. You've got Gibbs as the running back. Here's Gibbs. Tackled there by Lucas Van Ness. Second and nine. You know, Jeff Halfley came over, left Boston College in the college ranks as a head coach and decided to come back to the NFL where he'd been assistant for a long time and brought a new scheme in. And it just feels like second half of the season like you expect he gets to know his players a little better They get to understand his scheme a little bit better playing much faster in recent weeks They knew they had their hands folded out against golf and company Defense is ninth in points allowed. Ninth best. Clay Walker makes the tackle there on Gibbs, setting up a third down. And Walker's really become the guy that they turn to. He's the green dot. and again with the rookie edger and Cooper down takes on even more responsibilities in the middle of that defense. Got to get the calls. Got to have disciplined eyes against a very balanced offense with Goff and the weapons he has around him. Leading the team in tackles as he did in his first two seasons as well. Third down and five. Goff under pressure. Going to get him at the 10-yard line. That time Rashawn Gary comes in. and gets a second. Doing more rushing this year under Hathaway's scheme. Yeah, and also bringing the blitz up the middle, Quay Walker. He creates, by bringing that blitz, it creates a little bit of one-on-one. So Gary benefits off that. Right a matchup with Sewell comes off of Sewell. There's the blitz from seven. And then there's no one able to adjust because of that blitz to be able to pick up Gary once he moves off of Sewell. So that's the only way you're going to stop golf. You've got to get him off his spot, and you've got to pressure him. Jack Fox having a great year. Leading the league in net punting average. And a fair catch made at the 48-yard line here by Jayden Reed. So we're talking about the Lions and the injuries. And there's Aaron. You can't say enough about this guy. I mean, Ben Johnson gets a lot of the talk in regards to the next head. What about this guy? Look at that. Look at the guys on injured reserve right now, including Hutchinson, Davenport, Anzalone. These are big names, big guys, important guys. They're bringing guys off the street, and they're doing a great job. Hi, there's Hutch up there watching, looking down, and I'm with you. It's incredible. Not only do you lose your alpha and Hutchinson, your game record, but for your top five linebackers, you're bringing guys off the street, and you're teaching them their scheme. And I'll tell you, first drive, they didn't look confused. They were playing fast. from the 48 out of the pistol. A little bit of room here for Josh Jacobs. Now we go to Kaylee. Guys, and to add insult to injury, the Lions defensive lineman, Aleem McNeil, has been taken back to the locker room to be evaluated for a concussion after getting a pretty thorough examination in the blue medical tent. Wow, he was in on that sackle. You saw him being taken off the field. And as good as they are at running back with that tandem, I would argue that DJ Reeder coming over from Cincinnati and McNeil together in the middle against the run, as good as you'll see in the NFL, and both of them now out of this game. Second and five, Love throws, going to the ground and trying to make the grab, and he does, a yard shy of the first down, is Reed. It's a good catch from a guy that's had some issues. This whole receiving corps has had some issues with drops. Actually, they're going to wave that one off and replay assistance. Right. Replay assistance. Says no. Well, I'll interpret. It's third and five. Yeah. Here's a great look at it. Yep. Great call. Yep. Incompletion. I was going to say they've had drops, especially Reed and Wicks. That would have been a great catch, but nonetheless, it is taken away. So third down. That is an expedited review. The best should be. Third down and five. Now look at everybody up at the line of scrimmage. Look out. Under pressure. Does anything just to get it away, which he does. Ezekiel Turner that time coming in, putting the heat on fourth and five. I'll tell you, it got me. They're bringing pressure. But I'll tell you a guy who's having a game is the guy in the middle. Look at that get-off with Connor. O'Connor, Pat O'Connor, the six-year man out of Eastern Michigan. With these guys that are down, he has stepped up with his opportunity. The second time we've seen him get off the ball, plus territory. They're going for it. Yeah, fourth and five at least lining up to go for it. Scoreboard has the decibel level at 115. That's what it is in an airport. Fourth and five. Clap, clap, clap. And no snap. Just trying to look to draw them offside, and they can't. In comes the punt group. Now at the end of that third down, if you go back and take a peek at the hit on Jordan Love, I'd love to ask Terry his opinion on that. Terry, what do you see here after he releases his football? It sure looks like this is forcible contact to the head and neck area. Roughing the pass. There should have been called on this one. Yeah. Darius Smith with the right hand came through. Clubbed him in the face mask. Missed that one. Loved on the bench. In comes the punt group. Dan Whelan. His first punt was 43 yards. Maurice Alexander to receive it. Alexander calls for a fair catch. Makes it at the 11-yard line. The hit to the head was missed. 3.50 to go in the opening quarter. Detroit 7, Green Bay. Nothing. The Ford Field on first half. Pass is caught on the outside by Williams. And he gets bumped out of bounds after a game of about 6. by Carrington Valentine. Second down. We saw a conversion on third down when they moved St. Brown on a very similar play. Just taking advantage of soft cushion and just creating space and matchups. That time for Jamison Williams. Green Bay minus Jair Alexander. One of the top corners in the league. Second and four from the 17. Off play action. Goff rolling and throwing. He just throws it away. Into the down marker. Eric Wilson chased him. Third and four. Yeah, Jeff Halfley dialing up some more pressure. You know, I think he sensed after that opening drive that Goff had too much time back there. So the last time we saw a little bit more blitzing. This time, actually, he brings 45. Eric Wilson from the field does a good job of flushing him out of the pocket. And that's their whole focus tonight. Any defensive coordinator knows that if Goff is back there clean, It's going to be a long night. Third and four. Keep it on the ground. Trying to get that first down. Very close to it is Gibbs. Let's see where they spot it. And they're coming in as if to give him the first down. And he does. He's got one at the 21-yard line. And that's an example there. Third and four. I asked Jeff Halfley, I said, you know, when you face a team that loves to run the outside zone play as much as they do, what do you got to do? and he talked about we've got to set the edge, try to get some penetration, but we've got to stay on our feet. That was a good example of that right there. They set the edge, and the backside defensive lineman able to close in by staying on their feet on that play. They squeezed the space out of that play. Now fires, and that's not caught. Laporta tried to hold it in at the 43-yard line and could not. It'll be third down at eight. when they get man coverage anytime you get that kind of man coverage you like to work across work to the middle whether it's a mesh concept or crossers he did everything right there got to the top of that route gets off away from Eric Stokes and just not able to hold on to that football looks like a referee maybe down oh yeah so one of the officials needs a moment that's Carl Johnson who at one time was the head of officials for the NFL and then he decided I want to come back out onto the field and he's a good man happy to see him get up maybe in a moment or two here and we'll take a moment or two ourselves. Taking it back to the official's locker room, which means you're down from seven officials. Terry, what is the rotation now? He's the line judge. Yeah, this crew will actually do without his position. They'll only have one official on Green Bay sideline. He'll adjust himself depending on down and distance. Okay. But we can get back in here as they examine him in the officials' locker room. Meanwhile, a quick pass here is caught by Williams. And Williams is out to the 49-yard line, tackled there by Kenny Clark. That was a third and eight. Now you've got a fourth and one at midfield. And a big thing that you're going to recognize is spotting the ball. Instead of having two officials that can come in, one from one sideline, one from the other, It's only coming from the near sideline now in the Detroit sideline. And it's fourth and one. They line up to go for it. And keeping himself. First down. Goff takes it to the 49. Behind Dragnow. Nice, easy save call. under center. Remember when people used to do this? Set a shotgun on fourth and one. It's pretty effective. You get under center, you just quarterback sneak. First down, move the sticks. Doesn't it worry you when you watch a game? You see shotgun on fourth and one. See it all over college football. Except in Philadelphia. Never see it. Play fake. Screen set up. Nice looking play. And a 13-yard pick up there for David Montgomery. Beautifully set up. Had a full convoy. Picks up 13. They're a great screen team. They just have a sense of when to start going to these RPOs in a screen game. Good job. Look at the linemen downfield. The timing of it perfect. Whether it's Gibbs or Montgomery. Really good job of looking that off and then dumping it down. Again, the room to work after the catch for that first down. rolling looking keeping games eight jared goff on the move you know he's a pocket quarterback but they they go so much play action waggles and boots that if you're going to be so concerned about what's downfield and you're not going to think about him taking off and going, then he's easily going to eat up that space. There's nothing but grass there and he takes it. Eight or nine yards. Second and one. Halfway through the third quarter. Leaves a yard. Gets that. And a lot more. Down the sideline. goes Gibbs. First and goal. Carl Brooks almost took this handoff. 94 right here. With the pick. And down the sideline he goes. Keyshawn Nixon. With the interception. And Goff, who rarely throws a pick. In fact, in eight of the last nine games, he has thrown none. In one game, he threw five and still won the game. Gets picked off here. Yeah, his eyes, I felt like they went to the middle of the coverage, or the defense, right there in the middle, and then didn't really look out to the right. He came off from the middle just trying to look the defense off, and before he could really have a chance to make a decision on, I better not make this throw, he just flips it out there, and Nixon, who's their best cover guy, with Alexander down, did a great job of feeling the route, stepped in front of it, and here come the Packers. Nixon had not had a pick this season Goff barking at himself first down at the 16 yard line Gibbs to the outside short game and Branch pays the price very slow and attempting to get up and now he does so Jacob second down and eight But what a block by Zach Tom. He and Sean Ryan came in together in their third year. Ryan, the right guard out of UCLA, and Tom out of Wake Forest. That was a good job. Like I said, Tom gets overlooked quite often. That time he was able to set that edge on that right side. Sean Ryan back in, shaking up toward the end of the half. Jacobs, 11, carries 50 yards. Love fires caught. And trying to reach for that first down is Wicks. Looks to be, yep, he's got that first down. You mentioned before we first came back here in the second half that Romeo Dobbs is out. And it's given Dontavian Wicks more opportunities tonight. And really good blockers. Had some drops that time. Looked it in. Great. Go in a hurry to avoid any defensive changes and working his way is Josh Jacobs. Finding his way into the end zone. And the Green Bay Packers, that didn't take long. Took them three minutes and 45 seconds to erase a 10-point deficit and take the lead. And now you're exactly right. That hurry up caught a lot of new faces on this Detroit defense. They were completely caught off guard. Look at them trying to get everybody on the same page. Confused. Roderick Martin, who's been here but hadn't played a lot of football, he's not able to get lined up. And that's a mistake against a powerful running Josh Jacobs who bounces all the way into the end zone for that touchdown. Seven touchdowns in his last four games for Jacobs. McManus for the point after. And just like that, Green Bay 21, Detroit 17 on Thursday Night Football. Ripping your pillow tight Excellent light End of night Since he threw five in one game and still won the game in Houston a few weeks ago. Meanwhile, it's a kickoff here, and Detroit will start from the 30-yard line down by four. That's a tough accomplishment, five interceptions in one game. and win the game. Look at this. He had four in his first three games. Then he settled in. And you have all those games. He had that one crazy game in Houston and then one tonight. Yeah, you're going to see a veteran bounce back from that. Let's watch Goff and his offense after just taking a couple body blows here to start the second half. Jay Brown's been quiet. He was in motion that time. Goff checks it down. Five-yard pickup here for Gibbs. Second and five, tackled there by Stokes. There's some popping going on tonight. These defenses, both these defenses are flying around and hitting people. Here they go, Tempo. They go hurry up from the 35-yard line. Goff checks it over the middle as their forward progress to the first down. and there appears to be here for Tim Patrick right at the 40 and the first down. I think that's a good decision by Ben Johnson just to kind of change it up, especially after the interception, go a little bit of tempo, trust the quarterback to get right back up on the saddle. This is a guy that's bounced back, showed you resiliency his entire career. Toss it back here. Trying to cut back. Game two for Jameer Gibbs. A game here for David Montgomery. But, you know, he was shocked. I mean, Jared Goff did not think he was going to get traded. Gets the call. Sean McVay is down in Cabo. Matthew Stafford is down there. It leads to the deal. You know, they gave up a lot. Yeah, they did. It works out for the Rams. They got their Super Bowl. And in the long run, it's worked out for Goff. And there's his family, his dad. And, you know, it's a team that I think feels that they have what it takes. They've built around him beautifully. Offensive line, the two backs, the great skill. So it's all working out for 16. And that pass is caught at the 45-yard line. So on the move again, it's Jamison Williams making that catch quickly. And how about this with a safety playing center field in Xavier McKinney? You've got to put this ball on a line, and you've got to give him a chance to be able to get down and get ready to be hit. Walker gets to him 29 late and coming up. 20-yard gain. Shoots it off to the side. Montgomery takes up about six. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Packers defensive lineman Lucas VanMess left the field earlier, and we didn't know why. Turns out he injured his right thumb, And then we saw him in the x-ray room looking absolutely distraught. He's come back to the sidelines, talked with their athletic trainer, and has a very strong tape job on top of his right glove. He has not returned to the game yet. And safety Evan Williams is being evaluated for a concussion. Yeah, we saw him go back a few minutes ago. Second down and five now for Detroit from the 37. Changing the play at the line. and then lost one and incomplete Jamison Williams and at that time it was Valentine covering on the play maybe not on the same page, third and five Green Bay continues dialing up some pressure Kaylee just mentioned that the rookie Evan Williams is out and Zane Anderson in his second year out at BYU is now in Jeff Halfley right there turned him loose on a blitz and once again David Montgomery right where he needs to be to pick that blitz up to give Goff the time. He's not able to make this throw. Let's see who he dials up here on his third down. Three tight ends in this set. Goff steps away from pressure. Throws caught. First down. Montgomery. Goff almost sacked. Took a step forward. Wilson is there. First down. Keep an eye on this guy Montgomery. He's there to help out. Just to check down. How many times have your Lions fan have we seen that? You clear it out. The receivers are so talented. The safeties, the linebackers are getting deep to take away those middle field dig routes that he loves. And he's so aware that once it's taken away, especially on third down, check it down to Montgomery or Gibbs and let them do the work after the catch. First down from the 31. Goff buys time. Wide open. Tied end. Recorded. inside the 20 and stopped there by about six white shirts. Boy, is that great when you run the football and even if they're not running it great tonight, the scouting report, boy, it's again, some pushing and shoving. Sewell's right in the middle of it. 95 Wyatt right there with him. But when you can run the football like this, this is the story of really Ben Johnson's offense. Early down play action. You get those linebackers running towards Gibbs to stop him from running, and then you're able to move that launching point and get Goff out away from the pressure, and he's got a wide-open Laporta there on the back side. Ticking down to the two-minute warning. They had to get a playoff, otherwise it would have been delay a game. And it's a run here for Gibbs. And that will take us to the three-minute warning officially with 1.53 left in the opening half in Detroit on this Thursday night with the Lions lead by three. Finish that off. The Niners go on to the Super Bowl. He had all those interviews. He said, I'm not quite ready to lead this group. You've got to wind up with the right organization. And that's true. So second down and seven. Quick flip to the right side. Laporta, look at him. Pull his way to the four-yard line. Tackled by Walker, first and goal. He gets some good blocks. He's a receiver's block as well as anybody in the NFL. But Sewell gets out there and Zeitler, the right guard, you'll see 71 and 58. But then good, tough running. Laporta, man, yards after the catch, physicality. But it sure helps getting those linemen out in front, paving the way. That time, Goff, as experienced as he is, they did a good job of confusing him and Jamison Williams. They showed blitz, dropped at the last second. Defensive end, Mosby actually affects that. And Jamison Williams, he didn't know if it was man or zone. So he stopped, and Goff thought he would keep going, and he missed. Base 19 or 20. Only missed last week from 45. This is from 43. Jack Fox to put it down. And the kick is good. Two minutes into the second quarter. in the game of the week in the NFL in Detroit 10-0 Lions. Absolutely. From the best. Yep. Bates to kickoff. We'll start the next drive from the 30 and we go to Kaylee. Guys, from L.A. to Detroit, Jared Goff is only first down by way of penalty. Can they get something going? They start here on the ground. Four-yard gain here for Jacobs, tackled by Campbell. Yeah, I think you'll see them go more and more back to the running game with Josh Jacobs. And the reason is, well, they've done a good job of creating pressure. Remember, some defense that has 13 players on the defense alone on IR. Three more down tonight. A lot of new faces. There's Muhammad getting involved. We've seen Pat O'Connor. A lot of different faces. But there's maybe the defensive assistant, coach, coordinator, maybe, and the entire NFL with what he has faced, Aaron Glenn, doing a great job so far tonight. They're working with pace and glue. Nice hole over the right side and exploiting it. And there he goes for a first down and more is Josh Jacobs. You know, the one thing about Jacobs and Barkley and Henry and Mixon and Houston, they're going to start making the running backs not undervalued anymore. I agree with you. I think that's become a big story this year. and I think it should be. It's been fantastic and this is what he brings to this offense. This is an offense that is built on the run game first. They've got to get him going. That's what he can do running through those arm tackles. He gets going. Then you'll see Matt LeFleur dial up those play action pass opportunities later. Now it's Emmanuel Wilson who is sparingly used and comes in to spell Jacobs every so often. taking that one to the 40-yard line, getting it to seven. Mohamed making the stop there. It'll be second and three. You know, without having an A.J. Dillon type of hammer back there, it's nice to see guys like Brooks and Wilson providing a little bit of depth in that backfield spot. I mean, Josh Jacobs, get to give him credit. He has been a workhorse. Seven games where he's gone over 18 carries, let alone gets involved in catching the ball out of the backfield, too. So, Wilson and Brooks, the longer we get into December and January, You're going to need Josh Jacobs healthy, so it's good they're able to step in there. Wilson and Brooks are both in the backfield. Now Wilson in motion. Give it to Brooks, and he's fighting for a first down. They may have picked it up. They're going to mark it at about the 37-yard line. They're ripping at that ball trying to get it out of there. First down. Heating up Jacobs through week 13. 9-87, he's over 1,000 yards with his effort here tonight he's already gained 36 yards you go back to Brockington and Amon Green, two Packers to finish in the top three in rushing pretty good company there Jacobs is back in the game ball at the 37 yard line look out and who moved first? Josh Myers snapping it. I didn't see a flinch. It's good that they've mixed in a hard count on O'Connor because he has been getting off the ball so quickly. It's making it tough on Myers and Jenkins, the guard. I don't know if he's up there, has some kind of tail or some kind of cue that's getting him off the ball, but a good job by Green Bay. Maybe that'll slow him down a little bit. Five-yard penalty first and five at the 32. Stucked at the line of scrimmage. Jacobs going nowhere. Jack Campbell, second year out of Iowa, making the tackle. And you've got to get the personality, the culture of Dan Conner teams. Watch, you'll see a man go in motion, who's a big man in Tucker Craft. Watch 85. Watch this. Bang! Look at that message being sent. And that's Trevor Nowowski, who hits him there outside. Puts a right on the money. There's the protection. Good job of looking off that safety in the middle of the field and able to just hang it up there and let Watson run right underneath it. Great play. 59 yards. It's their first passing first down. First down to the 12. Play fake. Pass is dropped. That's Watson. You know, it's so funny. You go out and watch him and what he's done. He's the big play guy. In his last seven catches, he's averaged 40 yards per reception. You know, he's really thrown because when he first came into the league, that's what he was. He's a vertical downfield threat. That's what he did his rookie year. And as he's grown, he's gotten better at running different rounds. but this is an offense that needed something to ignite them and push this defense back a bit. A 31-yard passing in the entire first half, and on that completion, 59 on one play. Second and 10. Play action. Drawing to the corner of the end is a little contact there, but incomplete. Again, Watson covered that time by Carlton Davis. We go to Kaylee. Guys, the Lions have ruled out defensive lineman Aleem McNeil from this game because of a head injury. Not a concussion, but a head injury. Yeah, we saw him go to the locker room and he came back. Thought he might get back in, but he's done. It's a third and ten. Again, they get to these third downs. They're down with a pressure from those linebackers and trying to get after Love and play man-to-man coverage behind it. Let's see what they do here. Delayed blitz. The pass to the end zone. Kraft. Touchdown. Wow. Tucker Kraft. And boy, did they need that drive. Boy, what a throw. And how about a matchup with your big tight end? He's got 6'5", 260 pounds, and he put a lot of heat on that. I mean, that is exactly what he had to do. His big body, he had leverage on the corner. He had to put it in there because he was closing. Davis was closing in in a hurry, and if he didn't throw it with that kind of velocity, Davis knocks that ball away. Extra point by McManus. So it's perhaps seventh touchdown catch of the season. He leads right down the field, and they get Jordan Love going. And some emotion on that sideline from the Packers after that touchdown. Touchback here. Let's take a peek again at the quarterback, Jordan Love. Watch his eyes looking. He's going to throw to the right. He's just kind of looking. This is all on timing. He's peeking. He's peeking. And now he sees the coverage, and he's got to put a lot on it. Gets it to the inside where Kraft can use his body. But it's fun to watch Love and kind of go into his mind there. seeing those eyes, making that perfect throw there for the touchdown. Beautiful shot of that. That's almost like a vision test. Don't move your head, just your eyes. Kraft waving. Waving to everybody. From the 30-yard line. Gibbs is the back. Tries to cut to the outside. Sworn any flag here. Each team has been penalized five times. Accepted penalties. They may have gotten Sewell the right tackle here. Holding. Offense number 50. Ten-air penalty. First down. There isn't 50. I think he meant 58. Sewell. He gets up with Kenny Clark working down. Kenny Clark's just inside of him. Just trying to seal. and that left arm gets up around the neck. So the Packers, that's kind of been their tendency this year. 55 points scored in the first possession in the second half. That's second most in the NFL. First and 20. Catch is made. Hey, before we get away from Sewell, we'll have to talk about him. Fourth year in the league, number one pick out of Oregon back in 21. This is a guy, he has not missed a snap since the 2021 season. Coming into tonight, he had played 3,103 consecutive snaps. You're never going to see that again. Hasn't allowed a sack, but has been sacked himself. Right. Exactly. He tried to let the big man throw it. He tells you what kind of athlete he is. Second 14. Now fires. It's intercepted. He didn't make the tackle, but you know what? Kraft going to think twice before he comes in motion to block 53 What a play Second and three Jacobs to the 24 line Green Bay on the move. Drive started back at their 30-yard line. They've run sixth place for 46 yards here. All runs, too. Yeah, being very patient here. Looks like Sean Ryan needs some help off. Ryan the right guard Coming in for at least one play He was the puller there He actually hits Quan Alexander 10 when he pulls around From the bottom here You'll see him work up And then look at 10 Quan Alexander hits him I think that collision maybe stunned him He's going to go to the sideline And hopefully come back Yeah, that's Kadeem Telford comes into his spot at right guard. First half from the 25-yard line. Left side. Hard yard flag thrown. That's Jacobs for one. This is why you see defenses play some coverage. They want teams to have to drive the ball without making mistakes, and Green Bay had been doing it until this holding call. don't give up the explosive make them have to drive without making mistakes offense number 74 10-yard penalty first down so that's the left guard that's Elton Jenkins his sixth year in the league out of Mississippi State first and 20 now yeah it's over here on the left see that left hand grabbing onto the jersey So back to the 35-yard line. Again, Love is 2 out of 5 for 23 yards and has not thrown a pass on this drive. And remember, Al, when he's dropped back, they have brought pressure, and it's affected him and the offensive line. Major. But this time he has time, and he's able to complete the pass to the 28-yard line that's Tucker Kraft. tackled by Branch. Luke Musgrave would have been the number one tight end, but it's giving Kraft the opportunity to shine this year, and he has done that with six touchdowns. There's Evan Williams, the rookie safety out of Oregon, who's had a big impact on his team. Jeff Haffley telling us this week how impressed he's been with the way he's been able to pick things up. So the Lions have been dealing with a ton of injuries, and now Matt LaFleur and the Packers potentially lose their free safety. Second and 12. Love. Stepping up. Stepping out. Looks for the first down and gets it. So from a first and 20 to another first down as they take it to the 13-yard line. And Mohamed gives him some pressure over to his right. But this opens up nicely. Remember, you touched on some of the injuries he dealt with early down in Brazil in the groin. It slowed him down. This is what he can bring to the table when he's healthier. We've seen him become this kind of guy these last three weeks, and this has been missing in this Green Bay offense. When everything's covered and you play man coverage, you better count for number 10 or he's going to take off. His longest run of the year, 14 yards. Back to the ground. Jacobs. Stop there by Turner. And a penalty. These linebackers are playing. They're adjusting to the motion. Getting downhill. This penalty may be on Detroit. Illegal use of the hands. Hands to the face defense. Number 99. Five-yard penalty will be added to the end of the run. Automatic. First down. So Zedarius Smith. When they lost Hutchinson, they picked up Smith. It's done a great job the front office has bringing guys in off the street, taking trades for guys. It's his hand underneath. Underneath, you can see on the neck there. So they get five yards, still first down. Eight runs, one pass. First and goal. Just a little bit late in getting up there, and McDuffie able to affect that, but still he got it off. Good coverage downfield. Opening drive of the game, eighth play here, third down and three. hangs in the pocket, fires caught on the run at the 25 Williams, out of bounds near the 10 yard line, Jamison Williams well they've been playing a lot in zone here on third down they go to man to man, it's a tough matchup once you're able to, this is Speedster, and this is Bullard who is playing nickel, tough matchup for him you can see the separation, and how about Goff here working through his This is really where he has grown. Once he has the time to be able to make this throw, he sets those feet, and it is right on the money for another first down there. It's two or two now on third down. And right at the 10, so it's first and goal. To the outside goes Gibbs, and we'll see our first flag of the night. In fact, two come in on the same play as he's pushed out of bounds at the 11-yard line. The left tackle skipper who is in for Taylor Decker. You know, he's a big physical guy at that time. He just lost leverage and had to grab on to the Packers' Rashawn Gary. Detroit already walking back. John Hussey is tonight's referee. Doing double duty this week. He reffed the Monday night game in Denver, Cleveland to Denver. So Hussey working on two days rest. Here he is. Holding. Offense number 70. Ten-yard penalty. First down. See, Skipper. Yeah, watch Gary. Watch him. He gets both his hands on him. He'll start to peek into the backfield on the inside. Sees the ball is going outside. Now he's able to get out there, but he couldn't because of that grab there by Dan Skipper. Good call there by the official. Again, minus Taylor Decker. The great left tackle is a Skipper taking. Skipper's been in and out of the Detroit organization like four times already in his career. Back and forth he goes. Montgomery and Gibbs both in the game. Off the fake. Gibbs makes the catch. works his way to the 13-yard line. Tackle there by McDuffie. It'll be second down and goal for the Lions. They drafted him out of Alabama. You know, I never try to put this pressure on him to be the next Christian McCaffrey, but he reminds you of that kind of skill set as far as his ability to run. He's a three-down back, and now because you have two backs, he and Montgomery, you're able to get him and keep him fresh for four quarters and hopefully throughout the whole year, but you can already sense They want to get him in space every week, but especially here tonight against the Packers. Extra pressure. Quick throw. Caught at the seven-yard line. Taking it in there is Sam Laporta. Had a tremendous rookie season. Laporta, great tie. Then 11th play of the drive coming up right now. Third down and goal. Yeah, Ben Johnson has an offense. It's been very good in this red area. They're sixth in the NFL, but they have had some issues in some games. Last week, two of five in a red zone. So against Jordan Love and his Packers offense, they need touchdowns down here. Third and goal. Surveys fires too high. But a flag in the end zone. Intended for Tim Patrick. Former Denver Bronco missed a couple of years. He had two surgeries. Evan Williams was covering on the play. Get the call from Hussey here. Third and goal prior to the play. What I saw was at the top of the route, not where he makes the play on the ball, but at the top of the route, he grabbed onto the shoulder pad, onto the jersey. It wasn't at the end where you could say, hey, that's not interference, but if you go back a little bit, let's see here at the top of the route, when he makes his break inside, he gets a little handsy. Watch him work to our right, and he grabs onto that jersey, slows him down enough for the officials to call that. They both play the same team. Fire to the pass, illegal contact, defense. Two fouls. Yeah, I did a little clarification here. Correction, there's only one foul on the plate. Fire to the pass, illegal contact, defense. Penalties, half the distance is full, automatic close down. I think that's what he's referring to. The ball was not yet in the air when he made that contact. when I talked about it. It wasn't near the end where a lot of times you'll see the interference. It was an illegal contact call, and the ball had not yet left a hand of golf, so they catch a break there on third down. Half the distance is just inside the four. First and goal. Into the end zone. Walking in. David Montgomery for the touchdown. Back with. Green Bay dialed up the pressure. They brought Quay Walker. But what a call. Talking about LaPorta and St. Brown. How can you forget about Gibbs out of the backfield? You get him one-on-one against a linebacker. Isaiah McDuffie drew the short straw. no chance on his angle route of staying with him. And I'll tell you, Gibbs sold it well to the outside. Bates for the extra point. And that one is just good. But good nonetheless. So it's 17-7. You want to see how to run this against man coverage? Gibbs used to in college at Alabama run routes with the receivers. He sells it out there and then works back underneath. McDuffie again tries to stay with him. You see he turned his shoulders to start to sprint to get out to the outside in the flat. He had no chance to turn it around. That is a great round and went in one-on-one by Shamir Gibbs and a heck of a call by Ben Johnson, the offensive coordinator, to get him isolated and get that matchup to the touchdown. And LaFleur's expression says it all. Turning a three-point deficit into a 10-point deficit. Green Bay, you mentioned getting the ball to start the second half. They've got to figure out a way to protect their quarterback, Jordan Love. He has been pressured. They have blitzed him. 3 of 7, 37 yards. His one decent completion to Watson ended up a fumble. A 20-yard reception was a fumble. Green Bay held to only 105 yards in the half. Paul will come out to the 30 with the time for one of two plays, unless you just want to kneel it down, go to the locker room, and take the ball when we start the second half. Remember, the last time they had the ball, they ran the football. you know and 12 play drive 10 runs so you're down 10 you get into the second half it's not time obviously to panic you get the ball to start it but combination of relying on that line and Jacobs and then trying to find ways to help this quarterback have time to throw Neal down takes us to halftime go to Kaylee well Matt you told us coming in you knew the Lions could move the ball on you offensively, how will you adjust in the second half to keep him out of the end zone? Inexperience on defense is not sit back and make these guys have to think. Turn them loose. Just go after the quarterback when he drops back to throw. And it works for a half. I cannot wait to see what Matt LaFleur's answer to that is in the second half. Yeah, that Detroit defense is the story of the first half. What a job they have done. Dan Campbell, the head coach, moments ago with Kaylee. Well, Dan, for all the injuries you have on defense, they've held Green Bay to seven points and forced a turnover. How do you explain their success? Well, look, AG's got a hell of a plan. The players are playing hard right now. We're doing exactly what we said we needed to do at this point. Make them earn anything they get and get a takeaway. We got one. We got to get another one in the second half. Offensively, you've controlled the ball and put up 17. How do you replicate that in a second? Yeah, look, same thing. We're doing exactly what we needed to do and what we said we needed to do. We just got to be more efficient running the football. That'll open everything up for us. Okay, thank you. All right, so here we go. Third quarter begins. Out of the pistol with Love. Handing them off. Jacobs to the outside. And that's the way the first half looked most of the time. Brian Branch comes up and knocks him down in the backfield. Second and 11. And it's fun to watch play against the run. You know, he's moved from that nickel spot where they played him back at safety. But when he reads run, he knows how to get up, hold that edge, and lower the boom. Those are two college players from this same school at Alabama. And Jacobs, I think, surprised by the force there of Brian Branch. We do all these games, I think half the players in the league are Alabama or Georgia. You would know. Second and 11. Deep drop. Has time. Going deep. Has his man. Caught. and taken down to the 10-yard line is Christian Watson. So you figure sooner or later that guy might get free, and it happens right there. Yeah, and a good job by this offensive line of creating the pocket. He wanted to line a scrimmage. He beats Carlton Davis to the inside, and then he works back to the other. Tough loss. They don't come much tougher than that. Of course, Dan Campbell, different reaction, obviously. Detroit wins it and a wild one in the Motor City JCPenney postgame show next Jacobs and Brooks both in the backfield Jacobs following Brooks Tackled by Broderick Martin Third and long Surprised that Green Bay determined to try to run the football into that front. I mean, they had everybody walked up close at eight, up close to the line of scrimmage. Within two or three yards, they still tried to run into that Aaron Glenn defense. Third down, indeed. Third and eight. See some of the confusion there with some of the newer faces. Clap, clap, clapping. Green Bay trying to get his act together here. Yeah, that was so interesting. Detroit's trying to figure out what's going on. Then Green Bay's trying to figure out what's going on. And the flag came down. He did get the timeout. The flag came out. But he just got to timeout. You're right. We saw movement on one side. We had confusion on Green Bay. This is a pretty big third down. Love did not want to have to use one of these timeouts, but really forced to there. Yeah, not in a game like this. That could come back to bite you at the end. Third and nine. Pressure. It's blocked well. The pass is going to be pulled in by Christian Watson, but short of the first down. Rookie Arnold makes the tackle. Campbell put the pressure on fourth and three. I'll tell you, if Detroit wins this game, Pat O'Connor, 95, he's going to get a game ball. With D.J. Reeder and now McNeil out in the middle, that's a real strength. And it's not always about getting the sack. It's about getting off the ball and affecting the quarterback. Here he is in the middle, matched up one-on-one with Josh Myers. Does enough here to be able to push and get in the face to get that ball out sooner than he wanted. Eastern Michigan product. Meanwhile, fair catch ball for him. Made at the 21-yard line. Detroit with the ball, and we will return in 30 seconds. This drive from the 22-yard line. Montgomery is the running back. Play action. Check it down. Montgomery. And he gets gang-tackled after a game of a couple. Nixon the first guy there. Second down and seven. I'd just like to note that St. Brown has not been involved a lot tonight in getting chances. Four targets, three catches, only 16 yards. One of the top receivers in the NFL. You know what? He's not out there moping. He's not complaining. He's out there blocking his ass off and just being a great teammate. His time will come tonight at some point. He's caught three at 79 on the season. Running into a wall at 5 against Montgomery. So it'll be third down and about six. You know, at some point he'll get a one-on-one matchup. matchup and it's just great to see Goff doesn't feel he has to force the ball to his guy I mean nobody wants to get the ball more to to St. Brown than Goff but the matchups right now have not allowed for that to happen but it will but the fact he's not forcing it the fact that St. Brown is just doing his job it's it's refreshing to see third and six Williams moving Goff over the middle Goff fires and that's going to be caught is in a first down that's Patrick making the grab but it's going to be marked a yard shy so with under two to play in the quarter fourth down fourth and one your own 31 yard line what are you going to do Dan Campbell has a reputation of going for it he's done it three times tonight he's made all three but here they are deep in their own territory. It's a big one. Three out of three. Can they make it four out of four? Or do they give it to Green Bay in great position? To the outside. Turns it back. No! Green Bay stops him. Gibbs taken down and the Packers are going to get it at about the 30-yard line. What's interesting to me, Al, is Goff has had some opportunities to sneak it. But look at the gaps here, taken away. He makes a call, can, can, can. They're going to go to the sweep to get it out on the outside. But look at the reaction from this defense. I mean, they are flying. They know the opportunity they have. Secondary coming up, that was Bullard. And then eventually, Clay Walker makes the play to keep him short of that first down. Great play by that defense. So a minute and a half to go in the third. Three-point game, Detroit on top. Lions trying to win their 11th straight. Packers trying to at least keep pace and get to within a game of them in the standings. A lot of strength tonight. Reed in motion. Circles back. Keep it on the ground. Four-yard game for Josh Jacobs in the 26-yard line. Second and seven. Three-yard pickup. You know, you look at that decision, and it's easy to say, what the heck is he doing deep in his own territory? But listen, you live by the sword, you die by the sword. When it works, and they end up going down the length of the field and putting points on the board, everyone's going to go, good old Dan Campbell. He's already three for three tonight. Risky, of course. You give the ball to Jordan Love here, but he's living up to what he does. You can't question it when he does it and it works. Yeah, a thin line between a genius and a bum. Meanwhile, free, juggles, makes the catch, and it's going to be first. What a poppy. Look at the way he gets up, too. Crab. Hit by Jack Campbell. Springs to his feet. Sets up a first and goal. Here's an example of having a guy that's been in town for about three days, Quan Alexander. Eyes in the backfield. Not real sure about his responsibilities and coverage. And this time, that defense brought a lot of pressure. Nobody at that second level of the defense. And there's Kraft, like you said, Al. Again, this guy making a play. That's 260 pounds moving around like that. That's a gold medal in the Olympics. We can pull that off. First and goal. Clock kicking down to the end of the quarter. Don't have to run a play. And they don't. That's the end of the quarter. Trying to get them to jump offside. End of the third. First and goal when we come back. Great game. Detroit 24th. Green Bay. Gold at the 6. crowd full volume Jacobs is the back Sim sets up in the backfield for a long count play action survey as time throws thought and that was spent shims number two tight end good set up in the back Backfield runs the route here, serves as a safety valve, second and goal. Love the call first and goal. Go play action there. I've been expecting Josh Jacobs. Think about the Packers. Scored 14 points in the third quarter on the verge of maybe punching another one in. But they really haven't had to drive the length of the field. They had the big 59-yard pass to Watson. An interception got them at the plus 30. And then the stop on downs gets them at the plus 30. Jacobs in there. Touchdown Green Bay, and they have the lead again. Followed Myers and Jenkins, the center and the left guard, and back and forth will continue to go. Boy, this is a heck of a game. It's going to be a heck of a finish. Watch the right guard right there. What a block by Ryan. A combination with Myers taking on Martin. That really opened the hole up. He doesn't need a whole lot of room. Once he gets downhill with the power he has in those legs, no chance of slowing him down. Boy, he's a great addition to this offense. That's his third touchdown of the night, right? Yeah. Brandon McVanish with the extra point. So they turn it over on downs, and it's a 30-yard drive, and we go back to Campbell's fourth down play here. Yeah, he again coming into this fourth down, and this one's deep in his own territory. He's made three, and instead of the sneak, he felt the pre-snap they had taken that away. But the Packers' speed and recognition of that perimeter run gets the defense off the field, and once again, number eight finds the end zone, and they make the Lions pay for that decision to go for it on fourth down. Yeah, big stop there. Quay Walker was the first guy to stop him. And Johnson goes, I should have called something else. Well, we've seen them respond when they've gotten down. That's what championship teams do. These two teams are just going to keep swinging for these last 14 minutes. Seven targets. He's in a good flow here to start this drive. The reason I brought up that we've seen Valentine in a corner is because this defensive backfield, as they approach this drive, they have to shift some guys around. Evan Williams is out of the game. Bullard is also out of the game. So you've had to take Nixon 25 from outside as a corner put him to the inside to take over for Bullard. So Williams and Bullard out there. Yeah, Nixon a big interception leading to a touchdown earlier. First down, a little toss back here. And a one or two-yard gain for Gibbs inside the 40-yard line, second down. It's one of those young defensive ends that they're excited about. By that time it was Cox, Brenton Cox, who forced that ball back inside. And if you're Detroit, 2.30 to go, time is not an issue. In fact, you're thinking more about on the back end about the time. Dan Campbell slowing the whole operation down after those two big completions already in plus territory. Yeah, time may be more of an issue for Green Bay right now. Second down and nine. Blitz from the corner. Pass to the outside. Short game here. Oh, and interesting. 2-0-1. And he goes out of bounds. Right. How about that? And speaking of Green Bay, hoping for more time, that was a big play to get Gibbs out of bounds. Carl Johnson, who had to come out with a shoulder problem earlier, now getting an earful from LeFleur. The only way you stop Goff on his plays, you've got to get pressure on him. He's clean. It's going to be a completion. Dumps it off here. Gibbs looking for the first down. And has it. Almost got pushed from behind that time by Wyatt to secure the first down with 1.55 remaining. This is the two-minute warning. 31-31. All right, so it'll be first down. Matt LaFleur still arguing. I'm trying to figure it out. By the clock stopping at 2-0-1, that would work to his benefit. No doubt about it. So it's probably something else that's in play there. Yeah, he was pretty fired up the entire time we were away. Meanwhile, as play resumes, first and 10, 155, 31-yard line. Goff sets it up to Montgomery, starting to slip, holds on, keeps his balance. Late flag. Yeah, late flag comes in, Nixon making the stop. Crowd responding to a replay. Still no answer from John Hussey. Bolden. Offense number 77. Ten-yard penalty. First down. Center front rag now. It was an interesting call. It was right after he snapped the ball. Tries to get out there to help out on the screen. That's Quay Walker trying to get to the football. And we were frame by frame there. I mean, if you do this on almost every play, you can find something like this. Oh, for sure. So now they're all the way back to the 40-yard line. What a huge call. They were easily in field goal range. Bates has had a great year. Ready to be called on. He hopes for the extra point. First and 20. Picking up about three is David Montgomery. The last thing you want to see is an unnecessary penalty from Green Bay. That time you saw a player just jump on the pile right in that gray area. He's got to avoid any kind of mental errors if you're Green Bay and you're desperately trying to hold them in this range. They take a timeout here. I think it's Enak Bari jumping in there. 55. Whistle had already blown. It's showing that. Yeah, there's a lot of emotion. Look, you know, the NFC North, tell me what's not a rivalry in that division. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Every single week seems to be a great matchup, and the emotion always flying, and the importance of this game. Under five minutes to go. What a weapon to have, and Josh Jacobs always is a threat. And with the way your quarterback's playing and the decision-making he's making for you right now, you've got a lot of ways to attack down here. sent Jacobs in motion Love buying time, Love throws caught, flags all over the place so Jacobs gets into the end zone but you saw the flags come in I think they may have an illegal screen or a pick on the offense, Christian Watson he knocked out Kirby Joseph he's trying to run his route and sell it That was almost like a crack block. I mean, he's out on the outside. Watch him work to our right, back to the inside, and then bang, right there, hits 31. That's what freed up Jacobs out of the backfield. And it moves the ball back to the 16. Second and goal. Four and a half to go. See the command there. Jordan Love clapping, moving Watson over the left. Now he moves Reed. Reed sets up in the slot. Three receivers to the left. Love looking, serving, under pressure. And then just throws that one away to make a third down and goal. Really good coverage by this young defense. We talked about they've been decimated with the injuries, but the one area where they've been able to hold up is these guys that are in coverage and playing all year. Arnold, Davis, Robertson, the secondary is held up, so that helps them to play this aggressive style. You got third and long third and goal here See if Aaron Glenn dials up pressure They have most of the night with those backers Instead, just rushed for Love to the 15, and that's all. Taken down by Ezekiel Turner. So he'll have to settle for a field goal attempt, which would tie the game. What a play by Turner. It's a guy that's had to step up when four of your top five linebackers are injured and not playing. You've got to turn to a guy like Ezekiel Turner, who came over from Seattle off the practice squad, and he makes this play in space against a very capable quarterback in Jordan Love. Late-breaking receiver as he's running for his life. Tough to see. 32-yard attempt for McManus right down the middle. 3-38 left in regulation. Pretty much all we could ask for. For more rushing touchdowns in consecutive seasons. It's rare company for Montgomery. So the Lions with a game tied. 3-38. Looking ahead down the stretch. The Lions have all three timeouts. And Jared Goff will go to work. 27 of 36. So he's 75%. 228 yards. Only Tua Tagalbao has a better completion percentage this season. Coming into tonight. From the 30. Running back is Gibbs. Play fake. Pass. Caught. Along the sideline. Williams. Gain of 19. They're playing Valentine into this corner on the right side of the defense. Doesn't do a great job of slowing down Jamison Williams. He's able to get to that second level. He's just reading 24 there. Decides to go up and over him in an easy completion to get this drive started. Five catches for Williams. 80 yards tonight from the 49. play fake again rolling, throwing, caught he's found his new man here Mr. Tim Patrick two touchdowns, another catch here Tim Patrick has now caught six in 20 seconds and you mentioned the division what's going on within the division Buffalo comes into town next week Detroit's trying to win the NFC home field all the way through and they're on the ropes tonight they got Buffalo coming in here next week Buffalo goes to the Rams this week then to Ford Field so now the Lions again trailing 14-20 left in regulation 40 seconds into the fourth quarter so Goff tonight 22-31 178, two touchdowns and a very costly interception Green Bay has done a really good job this Jeff Hapsley defense not giving up those big plays Those explosive plays. Keep in mind, they don't have Jair Alexander out there. And they played more zone than they would normally like to. Start this drive. Dopp slides away. Caught up at the 48-yard line. That's Tim Patrick. Comes off the touchdown grip. Brings this one out to almost midfield, 18 yards. Watch the mechanics and the ball handling by 16 on this play action. He's as good as there is. He spends a lot of time on it. Good job. Works the round stool, the right tackle, and then finds that second level where he makes so many of his completions over the middle, second level, and there's your guy, Tim Patrick, making a nice catch. Yeah, he sells it well. Meanwhile, you've got Jayon Bullard, the safety, the rookie out of Georgia. Second round pick. He needs some tackle. Kind of go back and forth, in a manner of speaking. Jane Anderson comes in at safety now with Bullard going off under his own power. Play resumes first and 10 from the 48-yard line. Goff over the middle, finds his man. Montgomery to the 45. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. Jared Goff just talked about how good he is with the mechanics on play action. They do a lot of early down, under center play action. I love to see it because the run game, married with the play action with Gibbs and Montgomery, really challenges the eye discipline of those linebackers and safeties of this defense. Second and four. This will set up a third and two. Montgomery stopped there by Kenny Clark. Kenny Clark's having a heck of a game, getting off blocks, using those hands, using his quickness. Crafty vet, ninth year out of UCLA. I mentioned before, the nominee this year for the Packers for the Walter Payton Award. First round pick back in 16. Ninth year is the Packers. Goff now third down and two. Hangs in the pocket. Fires. Caught. And there is St. Brown. He's been very quiet since the first quarter. So big catch here in the first half of Detroit. Yeah, you just have a feeling that this fourth quarter could be his quarter. Just too much space. You know, whether it's Gibbs or Montgomery sneaking out of the backfield. Here he's matched up there underneath against Quay Walker. So many options. So many threats downfield. As a defense, you're concerned. You're trying to prevent the big play. And a smart decision to just check it down to his guy, St. Brown, for that first down. And about two or three for Jameer Gibbs to the 31. Walker making the tackle. Yeah, I remember talking to Peyton Manning one time about he was so good at Indianapolis throughout his career with the play-action mechanics. And he used to film himself in so many different angles to try to get the view of the linebackers and the safeties and would work so hard to make the underneath center handoff and the play-action fake look identical to make those linebackers a little hesitant, not just on the play action, but the run game as well. Payton's been selling everything since then, too. Second and eighth. What a great job. Got fires, and inside the 20-yard line, Laporta makes the grab. I mean, we're seeing some tight end play tonight. Tucker Kraft with Green Bay, and Laporta really had the work to get open. I love how they're able to flex him out because of his skill set at 6'3", 245. You see that? He dipped underneath that tight coverage to regain leverage. And what a ball out in front there. What a heck of a throw and a concentration all hands from Sam Laporte. Five grabs tonight for him. Fake toss. Instead, keep it inside. This is St. Brown. Right on the big screen. That gets the response. It gets the response from LaFleur as well. so they got one timeout left minute 42 Detroit wants to make it a little even though this is within Bates's range you want to still kind of be aggressive and give him a little bit more of a cushion for sure got a couple plays here to to try to do that right now you'd be looking at a 55 yard attempt second and 17 Goff. Over the middle. Wide open. Outside the 20. St. Brown. Huge play. Well, you knew it was coming. St. Brown is the guy. David Montgomery does his job. Not only is he scoring touchdowns tonight, he picks up by Zan McDuffie, who's coming on this blitz, does a nice job of picking that up. And then Goff's able to keep his vision downfield. But how often have we seen Detroit? McDuffie, by the way, got up and still got to him. How often have we seen that deep cross or that dig route from receiver at the top of the route? A little push there. That's what Nixon was reacting to. But St. Brown gets away with it. Watch McDuffie get up after going head over heels. and they forced Dream Bay to use that last time out the final one and Detroit can milk that clock you see that follow through that right hand hits the helmet in McDuffie now there's a question as to whether he got the first down or not the game by rule when replay changes the result of the play we must run 10 seconds please set the game clock at 1.37 but in lieu of the 10-second runoff, Green Bay is elected to take their third and final charge timeout. Terry McCauley, what are you making of this? So, yeah, there was a lot of missed words in that announcement. It's actually an expedited review. They made it short because he was short. He didn't make the line to game. It does require a 10-second runoff, but Green Bay had already used their timeout, which they kept, which they're going to do. So it's now third and short with the time set to where he was going. And they're out of timeouts. They're out of timeouts, right? So if they pick up a first down here, they can run the clock all the way down and kick the field goal. Campbell just wants to get an explanation. Meanwhile, Goff has completed his last 13 passes. He's 32 out of 41. 283 yards 3 touchdowns tonight 2 to Patrick 1 to Gibbs 3rd in inches and does he get the first down Green Bay thinks not no he didn't you got Zane Anderson who comes up stops Montgomery short now this is a fascinating decision He's dying to go for it, but obviously he's got to kick this field goal to potentially win this game, or at the very least, go ahead here by three. So this would be about a 38-yard field goal. You're almost compelled to do that. If you don't make it, you're going to give the other guys the ball, and you're probably going overtime. Play clock is down. We'll stop at 2-1, whatever. 44 seconds, timeout, 43 seconds. If you're a Packers fan, the play of the game by Zane Anderson, who's had to step in at safety, he's the guy that knifed in there to submarine this play and give Green Bay some time. Even if this field goal is good, they still have a shot now because of this effort play by 39 to make that a tough play against David Montgomery. but a great job by Zane Anderson on that third down and short. That's a half a yard he needed. Remember, it took a review for that to come back. Right. That was a first down. They brought it back a half yard, and then Anderson makes that play. They're going to get the ball back, even if this is good, and give Jordan Love some time to maybe get in field goal range. So for the moment, they are leaving the offense out on the field. Ain't this fascinating? If nothing else, draw him off. Draw him offside, yeah. He's got the timeout. Yep. Maybe they're thinking, you know me, I'm the guy that goes for it on fourth down. Just try to, and then call your timeout. He could. They talk about how he has twitch. What a good getoff. Instead of tackling golf, he should have gone for the back, blown that play up. He just gets an arm on him. Good job of holding on to the football. And there's that acceleration. That's as good as anybody in the NFL from Jameer Gibbs. So first and goal. Gibbs has now gone over 1,000 yards for the season. Jacobs in it for Green Bay earlier in the game. Straight drop. And then thrown way out of the end zone. LaPorta well covered. Second down and goal with 6.23 left in the third. Remember, they talked about the importance of red zone, an area that they've been pretty good for most of the year. They're sixth in the NFL. But last week, two of five. You go all the way back to the Tampa game, one of seven. They've had a handful of games where it's not clicked. And in a game you just start to feel now, these quarterbacks are starting to warm up. These points are going to be really important where he tries to find this matchup. You mentioned St. Brown. We've not seen him get many opportunities, and there he is in motion. He scored three tonight for only 16 yards. Here goes Gibbs. To the four. McDuffie takes him down. It'll be third and goal. Remember when they were down here, they got all the way down to right before the half. And we thought, you know, where are they going to try to find a matchup? They ended up going to Gibbs, who was one-on-one against a linebacker. It was a mismatch against McDuffie. And it paid off with a touchdown. Third and goal. Sacked three receivers to the left. Keep it on the ground. And we're going to have a fourth down for about the two-yard line as Gibbs takes it maybe a yard. So fourth and goal. You know that they ran that play to get ready for this fourth down call. And Campbell has a very aggressive approach to these play calls. Those linebackers got downhill in a hurry there. That play really didn't have much of a chance to get into the end zone. All the way down the three-yard line here on fourth and goal. St. Brown is in the backfield. The pass is caught for the touchdown. Tim Patrick. We saw Green Bay score a touchdown with tempo. Look at the Green Bay defense, just like Detroit. Middle linebacker trying to get everybody lined up. A lot of confusion and an easy read for Goff on that touchdown to Patrick. It's really great to see this guy back. He missed two full seasons and a couple of surgeries. Looked like his career may be over. great player in Denver. Comes here. First TD for him since 2021. Extra point by Bates is good. And back and forth we go. Green Bay took the lead. Now Detroit has it back 24-21 on Thursday Night Football. In these games and we see them a lot on the John Hussey crew. Meanwhile, you've got the kickoff here and the touch back there. Nice touch by Jared Goff after that touchdown. The ball is on the ground. Everyone's excited. Goff with the presence of mind thinking, hey, my guy hadn't scored in a while. I think I'm going to take this one over to my guy Tim Patrick. Hey, man, take this. This is for you. Oh, it's great. He's a really solid guy, and he means so much in that wide receiver. Yeah, I talked to Antoine Randall on the field before the game, who's a great receiver coach, and he said, man, he is such a pro. He and Allen Robinson have come in there and helped out Jamison Williams, really set the tone in that room, helping out St. Brown and others. So now Green Bay, two quick touchdowns. We start the quarter. What are they doing here? Got a little flea flicker, and Love pumps, throws. a lot of nothing for all of that action. Yeah, he had a chance if he had time. But once again, these guys, you know, they just got here. This was Miles Adams, who's just recently been signed. He's up there lined up at the nose. This play takes a little bit of time. See pressure right there coming through the tight end, Ben Sims. He's lucky to keep his feet, but he had open receivers downfield. Second and ten. People said we brought it up to him. Boy, you get Terry on Arnold in the draft. You pick up Carlton Davis in a trade from Tampa. You go out and get Amik Robertson in free agency. He said this growth over these last two or three years, that was the last piece. We had to get better at corner to free up Aaron Glenn with what he likes to do. And even with these injuries, they're maintaining that aggressive approach because they are healthy at corner. Again, allowing the second fewest points in the league coming into the game. Look out. Love escapes. Love throws. It's caught. It's juggled. Pulled in by Watson. Another big play for him. That's how Jack Campbell came. Almost had the sack. Boy, did he time this up perfectly. And for whatever reason, Jacobs misses this blitz pickup. But who bails him out? The quarterback. A healthy Jordan Love able to step away from that pressure. How about the location of this football? Resets the feet, throws it right on the money, maybe an inch or two over the outstretched arms here of Carlton Davis. Watson now four catches tonight, 114 yards from the 45. Jacobs tries to cut it back. Uh-huh, long takes him down. Second and 10 is the clock. Runs down to seven minutes left in regulation. Muhammad there showing great discipline on that back side. You always got to be aware of the Jacobs. He's liable to go anywhere. If he gets closed down in one spot, he does such a good job of the feel and vision to cut it back. Muhammad that time takes it completely away. Second and ten. This is all you could hope for. Divisional matchup, 31-28, 6.30 to go. I'll see. Brooks is the running back out of the pistol. Love. Fires over the middle. Catch is made inside the 20-yard line and spun down Dontavian Wicks for a big first out. Boy, this time the offensive line does give him just enough time. The pocket will be collapsing around him. Good job of just kind of waiting and waiting and waiting on this crosser over the middle. keep in mind their top receiver Dobbs who would be running those rounds is out tonight and Wicks is able to step up the second year man out of Virginia goes up climbs the ladder to make that catch and Branch is hurt on the play Brian Branch down to the 35 yard line after a 27 yard pickup this is a big night tonight for Detroit because of what they have remaining on their schedule compared to what Philadelphia has on their schedule. It's like he was cramping there after he tried to make that tackle. Here's a Detroit schedule. Buffalo, of course, a tough one. Go to Chicago, go to San Francisco, and then wrap it up with Minnesota here in Week 18. Remember, Minnesota will be playing with everything they have in Week 18. in San Francisco and the NFC West. They're going to be playing like they're playing playoff football, trying to get any win. Somebody's got to win that division. Brandon Joseph comes in replacing Brian Branch, who goes to the sideline here. They empty the backfield on a first down from the 19-yard line. Four-man rush. Low throws. That is caught. And a first down here. So back-to-back to Wicks. And he will be slow in getting back up. what a job here of the quarterback again Jordan Love hopefully Wicks will get helped up there he is Love is able to work through his progressions Wicks is stepping up we mentioned how Dobbs is not available how about that route little whip route back to the inside takes a huge hit and is able to hold on to it works through the progressions the lines able to hold up and if you're a Green Bay Packers fan You're on the road in this environment. Isn't it great to see Jordan Love healthy these last four weeks? What a difference from where he was early when he had to deal with the groin, weeks eight and nine, the knee, weeks two and three. What a difference between the first half and the second half. Oh, yeah. Good call. First and goal. He's now thrown for 206 yards. First and goal from the seven. Jacobs bunched up at the 5. Muhammad loses his helmet. First down. Beautifully designed play. Yeah, it sure was. So much attention on Gibbs. Everybody's eyes were thinking the ball's coming out here. And here comes the right side of the offensive line leading St. Brown. You can't always get him the ball throwing it to him. You just want his hands on the ball. Again, he's being rewarded for the kind of player he has been. He's been quiet. There's Sewell, who's so much fun to watch when he gets downfield. Smart man, St. Brown, getting behind 58. It's like a bodyguard following him downfield. Montgomery gets punched up at the 4. 10 minutes to go in regulation. It'll be second down and goal. after a quiet first half I got to show you this just because this is another play that shows St. Brown's attitude that was Bullard going in being carted off watch St. Brown's block here bang! It's what he's been doing all night that's McKinney he didn't appreciate that he's an alpha himself on the other side no question, J.R. McKinney with 7 interceptions this season so Bullard goes back to the locker room on the cart And he will toss back here to Montgomery. And he cannot get in. Play is blown dead. It'll be third and goal. They got two plays. They have been successful on these fourth downs with the exception of the one deep in their own territory that backfired on him. Where Green Bay got the go-ahead score. So Patrick goes wide left this time. Montgomery is the back. Play fake. To the end zone. Car touchdown! Tim Patrick again! Talk about his mechanics. Even on third down under center, he wants to freeze those backers. Good job. He knows where he wants to go. He sees the matchup, gets back to Tim Patrick, who Tim Patrick ran a heck of a route being able to separate from Eric Stokes there. He's got two footballs now. He does. First touchdown since 2021. Bates with the extra point. And Detroit has the lead again, 31-28. Action game perfectly, especially as the weather changes here in Lambeau. You can just picture those games that are going to be coming up. Keep number eight healthy. What a difference he is. Well, they had to make a choice between Jones or bringing him in. This guy's four years younger. That's a good call. That backers into Kaylee. Guys, the Lions defense is trying to hold it together while they were on the sideline. Linebackers coach Kelvin Shepard was yelling at his unit saying, I don't want another missed assignment. That was while Quan Alexander was sitting in front of him with a moist heating pad on his left quad. On the bench next to the linebackers, there was Brian Branch getting his left calf massage looking uncomfortable. And he and Terion Arnold were sitting there both wearing oxygen masks to help him breathe. But Zedaria Smith, just before they returned to the field, said, right now, right now, it's going to be on us. That's crazy. They were so great in the first half. But meanwhile, the Packers, three touchdowns on their four possessions in this half, start here with a flag before the play. Kind of wants the crowd to really get into it. Full start. Offense in the fifth. And that's right. Right tackle, Zach Tom. Of course, this is the hungriest fan base in all of football. Oh, it has to be. Have never been to a Super Bowl. This will be Super Bowl 59 coming up. Can they get to New Orleans? Got close last year. Had a big lead in San Francisco at the half. 49ers wound up winning the game. Worth mentioning for people just tuning in. This defense has been decimated with injuries. 13 guys on the IR three other starters down and yet they're gonna have to make some plays tonight to win this game First and 15 a one-yard pickup here Pop that time by Carlton Davis and only offseason pickups from Tampa Bay I thought it was interesting Dan Cameron or he just says to heck with it. Are they going? They are going And then Goff falls down But Montgomery is able to pick up the first down So Goff falls down As he's making the handoff And they should seal it They'll run the clock down What a call And then Goff is stumbling He's trying to make the handoff I don't know, he must have gotten stepped on When he came out What a good job of Keeping his focus and staying Long enough on his feet. Let's watch his feet. Yeah, he gets stepped on by Glasgow, the left guard. And somehow he reaches out. Once he got it to Montgomery. What a call, by the way. Are you kidding me? Four of five now. College ball, he's down. This is a pro game. He's good to go. Four of five on fourth down. Amazing. Hey, you got to be who you are, right? Yeah, that's right. You've got to be who you are. He's Dan Campbell. Meanwhile, Nixon was shaken up. And Campbell's heat. You've got to love Dan Campbell. I mean, he's what he said. Don't forget, he's the guy who came in and he said, we're going to bite off your kneecaps. Everybody says, who is this goof? And look at his face. You know what? That was about not getting in the kicker closer. You know what that was about? Taking all the time away from Jordan Love. the possibility of him getting the ball and moving into field goal range. He thought it was worth the risk to go for it, believed in his guys, gets the first down, and now works that clock down, kick a last-second field goal, and LaFleur and Love won't get a chance to touch the football. And a major risk. And Love would have had to do it without a timeout. That wouldn't have been easy either. Just get it in the middle of the field. We've had a few crazy endings on Thursday. We've made it up for the last two years. No doubt about that. Just getting it in position where Bates wanted it to get a better shot at it. So it comes down to this. Bates is no stranger to winning games at the end. 52-yard game-winning field goal against Houston. Had a career-long 58 in that game. Kicked a 64-yarder for the Michigan Panthers to the United League. Reminder to stay tuned after the game, the JCPenney postgame show. Kaylee with the star of the game. A lot to chew on for that game. Yeah, that kick he made in the UFL, that was a bomb. it's a different risk here well different challenge I should say here pressure Hogan have to snap it Jack Fox to hold it 35 yards to win it and extend the winning streak to 11 Ball game. And what a game. 34-31. Lions go to 12-1. Still the number one seed in the NFC. Packers drop to 9-4. So the two games this year that Goff and the Lions played against Green Bay, 6 of 7 on 4th down and 4 4th down touchdowns. Just incredible. The risks that he's willing to take in these divisional matchups and it pays off for it. Some are riskier than others. That was an A plus or an F minus. I think it would work out. Goff made it extra special by getting stepped on, getting out of there. Amazing. And it's still got the football to Montgomery. 34-31. So Bates, he's getting used to this. Does it again? Yes, sir. And 35 out. That made the difference. Goff, 32 of 41. 283 yards for LaFleur.
