 Fire all over Soldier Field on this chilly night. Washington won the toss. They defer. Can they end their four-game losing streak? Can the Bears get back to .500? From Chicago, Soldier Field. Off we go. And they let it bound into the end zone. And thus, the Bears wearing for the first time orange helmets. First time in their history. Fields last week, he had four and a half kind of, you know, block games and then a great second half. A good ending to the first half, too, after a pass to Darnell Mooney. One TD, rating of 118.8, the only time he's been over 100. The league average this year is low at 89. What a catch by Mooney, by the way, on that play. To really turn the complexion of that game around, gave him a chance. Overcame an 18-point deficit to the Vikings. but lost in the end. Fields with a shoulder shake. He's under pressure. Takes a lot of sacks. Avoids one here. And does what he does best. Uses those legs to pick up an ice game. He was trying to get that quick throw out. It was defended well off to the right. Good tight coverage by the commanders. You'll see he just wants a quick little easy completion taken away. This is what he brings to the table. The athletic ability to create. Instead of just throwing it away, His athletic ability allows him to get away from the trouble, and now he's a handful for a defense because he can run and pick up big yards. Two backs with him, Montgomery and Tristan Ebner. Ebner going in motion. The pass to the left side caught up at the 40-yard line. Darnell Mooney makes the grab. He's their leading receiver, but it's only his 11th catch of the season in this game number six. Remarkable, Alan, you think about it. I mean, Justin Fields settling in with a new offense with Luke Getzke. Luke Getzke was the quarterback coach in Green Bay and worked around Aaron Rodgers, and he's bringing a different offense in. And it's taking time. But you can tell they're still finding a way to trust Justin Fields in his passing game. Average of just over 17 passes a game coming into tonight. Only 88 on the season. and this is a one-yard pickup for their number one starting back, David Montgomery. They use a lot of Khalil Herbert as well, who's averaging almost six yards per carry this season. They are known for running the ball. 60% of the time, they're going to run the ball. We just talked about only 88 attempts coming in to deny it as a team throwing. So what's ironic to me with Matt Eberflus, I told you in the open, if they're going to win this game, it's going to be the arm of Justin Fields. They're going to have to make some explosives against this defensive line with Jonathan Allen and Deron Payne and Montez Sweat. They're not going to be able to run the ball and score points. They're going to have to hit some big plays. Second to nine, a little toss back here. Montgomery looks for room, cuts it back. The Bears with a flag down, our initial flag of the evening. The referee tonight is Adrian Hill. And he will give us the call in a moment. holding defense number 93 that's the pro bowler Jonathan Allen first down Jonathan Allen moved outside here and just kind of gets caught up in the wash just trying to fight to get outside to get involved I leave that one to Terry. Well, there was a lot of pushing and holding on both sides here. Only the 14,000th time that's happened in the history of the national football. But they call it. Yeah. First down here. Fields. Has some time. Pocket breaks down. And down he goes. And that is F.A. Lovato who comes in. And so the receivers recovered, took his time in the backfield, tried to scramble, get sacked. And this is a coverage sack, and it's one where Justin feels an area that he's got to grow. Look to the right and watch the protection. See, that's an open receiver. He's got to make that throw and put the ball out in front of his receiver. He just doesn't trust it. And this is an example of where he is right now in his development in his second year, where he doesn't trust. In the NFL, that is an open receiver, and he's got to let it rip. 19th time he's been sacked this year loss of 9, second and 19 fires to the right side on low and incomplete intended for Darnell Moody so the Bears in a hole to third and 19 early in the game if you look at Justin Fields coming out of Ohio State he started two years there expressing his displeasure now watch at the break that's the only contact you see I think he might have gotten the jersey right when he pulls right there Right at the beginning, as he cuts out of that break, at the end of the play, you look at it, it doesn't look like anything. But right at the break, he grabbed on to him, and that's when the official threw the flag. First down here, Wentz deep and incomplete and dropped to the goal line. Curtis Samuel was there. Trying to look it into his hands and could not second down and 10. This is a really good job by Wentz going from pre-snap to post-snap. Breeding Eddie Jackson, clearing. And it gives him the seam route right that he wants. Asking a linebacker to try to get vertical to stop that with Morrow. Well-thrown ball. Just missed time there by Samuel. That's a touchdown. God forbid. Second and ten. From the 40. on the ground and a gain of 18 here by McKissick coming out of the backfield it's the first drive we've seen with the commanders putting it together mixing in some run and some throws first time we've seen this offensive line remember it's been a tough year trying to be able to establish continuity with the revolving doors six game, six different combination up front Divas penetration tonight for Washington. Taking the ball to the 20-yard line. McKissick again. Stop by Blackson. Each team with its full complement to timeout. Clock keeps rolling under a minute. Just like a secondary tries to work together and build that harmony. The offensive line, you talk quarterback play and receivers and skill all you want. If you don't have five guys working as one, it's really hard to have consistency. It's the first drive, like we said, we've finally seen this group come together and give him time to throw and open up some running lanes. Washington takes a timeout with 57 seconds. Well, he's still working that in. Yeah, for sure. Keeping it warm as well on this night when the temperature is in the mid-40s. It's 41 right now, actually. It's dropped down to the low 40s. They did defer when they won the toss, so they will get the ball to start the second half. Quinn sends McLaurin over to the right side. McKissick is in the backfield on second and six. Samuel sets up on the left. Four-man rush. That pass is dropped. Curtis Samuel very often lines up in the backfield, but not tonight. from the outside here, third down and six. They have done a good job with this defense on third downs. Allen Williams mixing up the looks. They've not converted a third down yet tonight for Washington, so let's see if Williams decides to dial it up or sit back. The pressure has really impacted the communication up front and affecting Wentz in his time. Looks like already they're leaning and showing pressure. Wentz to the end zone. McLaurin cannot make the catch. Jalen Johnson covering on the play. Fourth down, 50 seconds. And in comes the field goal unit. What a play by Johnson. Remember, this guy is back. Finally had a quad injury. Missed a few games. Good against good again. Into the boundary. And he gets that left arm extended. He's beaten by a step or two, but reads the eyes of McLaurin to get his arm up to bat that ball away. 38-yard attempt. Make probability is right there. Powered by AWS. Joey Slide. How do we do? As they say, points on the board. As if they could be someplace else. 3-0 Washington. And the Bears will begin from the 25-yard line. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS, Khalil Herbert had a great run. It's expected to be about a six-yard gain. Tackled right there. But because of that lead strength, his power, being able to get away from that 58-4 yards, a career high for Herbert, and set up what we thought was a potential score for the Bears, but ended up not making it on a fourth-down try. from the gun nowhere to go with his football Hildor right there has McLaurin locked up great coverage comes up with a sack Trestway punt number five for him Bearcats called for it and then they let it bounce Jones does and that will back it's been red zone defense by the commanders first time that the Bears got it close come up with a pick deflection off of a helmet here's third down looks like he may have a chance comes up a little bit short they decide to go for it fourth down and about half a yard to get that touchdown and Holcomb makes a great play keep the Bears out of the end zone twice they were down inside there and you can see zero points allowed 202 total yards of opportunity No points. Drive starts from the six-yard line. With no gain here for David Montgomery. Second down. It's going to nine. Give him a yard or so. Second and nine. They're going to try to work away here against Jack Del Rio's defense. Remember, early in the game, what were they doing? They were moving the ball. And Luke Dexie was dialing up with perimeter runs, early down play action. Now they're inside their own tent. He's just trying to get a first down. But if they do pick up a first down, we'd not be surprised if they go back to what was working, which led them down to those two red zone chances. Almost a 2-to-1 ratio, rushing over passing. Fields hit as he throws, and that pass will drop incomplete, so it'll be third down and eight, and down he goes to the turf again. Montez Sweat is there. Wow, Sweat against the rookie Braxton Jones. I thought we might be seeing more of this tonight. Think about what he did last week to the Titans. Now here he is against a rookie on the left side and just pushes him right back into the backfield and almost comes up with that sack. I mean, Fields is known to be holding the ball. He holds the ball longer than any other quarterback in the NFL. But here he tried to get it out quicker, but still sweat gets in there before he can get the ball out. Third and eight. caught, running his way first down, Belis Jones so they convert on third and long and take it out to the 19 yard line really good job here just being an athlete Jones instinct of quick throw and then the linemen work to get out the front and he does a good job of getting back behind those linemen using them to just shield the defenders using that speed to pick up the first down Montgomery in with a fullback and gets taken down at the 21-yard line. That's where they're having their success, or they were, trying to get that ball bouncing away from that inside pressure of Payne and Allen. So, in 2022, fewest passes, 21 sacks third most, And taking the longest time to throw. 3.35 seconds. Second and seven. Pass caught. But they say no. Washington at least says no. It's Kendall Fuller there with Darnell Mooney. And they say it's a four-yard pickup. You wonder why 3.35, right? 3.35. Let's see if he holds on to this. Ball looked like it hit the ground there. No challenge. Third and three to the outside. Montgomery. He gets the first down and more. And that brings the crowd to life as he takes it up to the 38-yard line. There they go. Working again to the outside. Get the ball away from the inside where that strength is. his little pin and pull. Receivers do a good job of sealing, and then you get the linemen out in front. Seal that edge, and then get the linemen out in front, and then you just allow your back to be able to find that crease and get upfield. Left guard Lucas Patrick shaking up on the play. He'll get assisted back to the sideline. Let's finish that point. The 3-3-5 has a lot to do with him being unsure. Sure. And he's looking, and he's looking, and he's looking. You know, you watch these NFL quarterbacks like at Rodgers or Brady, the ball is out. And it's because they have an answer for anything the defense gives them. Young quarterback like this, he still, he wants to be sure. And he hitches and he hitches. And that's why it's a combination of the line and fields holding on to the ball. 19 and 20. Let him into the playoff both years. In fact, the last year, he got him all the way to the national championship. Threw 63 touchdowns and nine interceptions. The guy knows how to throw the ball. His physical ability is through the roof. It's just like a lot of guys transitioning from college to the pros, just has to kind of get comfortable with the system and his receivers. Third and 19. Look out. And down he goes back at the 30-yard line. So two sacks after a promising beginning to this drive. And they'll punt. That's Payne and Allen both in there on the sack. Really good job here by the commanders of keeping him in the pocket. That was the emphasis on our Zooms. Everybody we talked to, they knew that if they could get him off his primary, you can spy him with the middle linebacker, 55 Holcomb. Instead of getting upfield, you get to push up the middle, and you squeeze him from the edge. Trenton Gill, who was picked in the seventh round, the punter for Chicago. Collected at the 16-yard line by Dax Milne. And he gets banged down, and the ball for the moment appeared to come out of the 19-yard line. The Bears think they have it, but they don't. Play blown dead. And Washington will get possession. Wentz and company going to work when we come back to Chicago. Surviving the two gunshot wounds. And eight weeks later, in the starting lineup for Washington, Robinson. Picks up a hard yard or two. Taken down by Joe Thomas. Carson Wentz, first year with Washington. Five years at Philly, one year last year at Indianapolis. And then the trade. Second and eight. They go no huddle. Robinson again. And this time another hard yard and a half to set up. Third and long. That's Roquan Smith tied for the lead lead in tackles. Making the stop. A lot of movement on the inside of that defensive line. So what you do is you eat up and occupy the offensive linemen. You free up one of the more athletic linebackers, Roquan Smith. You see Nicholas Morrow, 53. Both these linebackers can fly, but clearly led by 58. He's one of the tops in the league. Smith and Morrow, two linebackers who have played every snap this season. J.D. McKissie comes in on third down in the backfield. Wentz under Pete and down he goes at the 17 yard line Jaquan Brisker a rookie picked in the second round out of Penn State comes in from the secondary to take him down they've got seven guys walked up Brisker off the far left comes free you get a linebacker coming through as well and then they drop. So this offensive line doesn't know who's going to come and who's going to drop. Confusion up front and it frees up brisker off the edge. Great call there on third down to confuse him up front. Dressway, ninth year in the lead. Left-footed punter of beauty. Fielded at the 24 by Vila's Jones. And it's a 10-yard run back up to the 34-yard line. So we've already had three sacks in the game. 9-16 left in the first. Nothing, nothing. From the 34-yard line, Fields rolling, looking, throwing, caught at the 49-yard line by the tight end Cole Komet. First down, and he missed Field. Now he ends up completing it, but if you look on the back side, watch this open up on the back side. Off the play action, and all of a sudden, if he's ready now, he can throw it. Now he can throw it just a little late, making it tougher. Now he's able to get it in there. He takes a hit, which is unnecessary, and there's the arm talent to be able to make the throw to commit for the first down. At the 49-yard line. Fields, play fake, drops it underneath, getting out of a lot of traffic and turning it into a 13-yard game, but there is a flag goes commit again. So back-to-back passes to him. But here comes the call from Adrian Hill. And the Bears already starting back. In Elf will remain downfield. Offense, number 75. Five-yard penalty. Replace first half. Larry Borum is the right tackle. Right up here. He just starts to sneak down. 75 he gets right there breaks a tackle and then takes the ball to the 6 yard line Eddie Jackson darting through could not bring him down behind the line of scrimmage second down and goal now from 7 Eddie Jackson walks up all the way to the line of scrimmage and then he uses his vision to be able to see the receiver coming in motion and he knows right now before eight could even have a chance at blocking him. Robinson, he gets upfield to make that a negative play. Final minute of the third. Wentz is going to keep it himself and get to the five-yard line. Tripped up there by Tyler Gordon. Locked it down to 30. Don't have to run a play here if they don't want to. trying to catch him off guard there. Wentz does have that athletic ability on that zone read to pull it out. You just don't necessarily expect him to keep it. That was a quarterback keeper all the way, but the Bears ready for it. Third goal, they will switch into the field. What do you know? We have a veritable shootout. End of the third. Chicago, seven. Washington, three. here's that running play the last play before I think it's right there he came down with all his weight on that inside foot so they re-taped it and now he comes to the line of scrimmage third down and goal this is the 12th play of this drive and you get a whistle before the snap the Holy rest on I will start off on Sims so now third and goal back to the 10 yard line loud as this stadium has been tonight Cam Sims just flinched right before the snap Six runs, five passes on this round. Five first downs. Third and goal. Wentz tipped. Incomplete. Fourth down. Justin Jones got his hand on it. Fourth and goal. He's trying to check that underneath to Curtis Samuel. Bears, good job of sitting back. Everything covered downfield. Just nowhere for Wentz to go with his ball. See Samuel to the right, working across the middle. Everything taken downfield with that coverage. And even if he catches that ball, he's going to come up short with Roquan Smith right there. Joey Slide. Chip shot field goal. and 28 not by much but through it goes to make it a 7-6 game nine seconds into the fourth after the kick we're going to talk about the Washington situation which is very much in the news with the owner Dan Snyder who is here tonight his team right now is down by a point nine seconds into the fourth Chicago trying to get to 3-3 and Washington trying to snap a four-game losing streak. And from the one that's run back here, Jones. There was a report today on ESPN alleging that Snyder is accumulating damaging info on other owners and Roger Goodell's leverage. There he is in the middle. To avoid being voted out of the league, our Michael Smith reporting before the game, Snyder is the subject of five different investigations or inquiries for sexual harassment, a toxic work environment, financial irregularities. This has been an ongoing story with the investigations and all of that. And the owners have a meeting scheduled in New York on Tuesday. It is not currently on the agenda. Fields under pressure. just my feeling I think what the league would love so Payne comes to the sideline it'll be second down and nine Getsky the play caller for the Bears good job again of mixing up looks and trying to work the perimeter both with quick throws and also runs whether jet sweeps or just running the back and he's run out of bounds in front of the Bears bench and the flag comes in at the end of the play During the return, holding against the return team, number 34, 10-yard penalty, first out Washington. The Chicago Bears with a ton of rookies. 15, in fact. And 14 have played. One has not gotten into a game yet. More rookies than any team in the league. You've got Briskers played every snap. Gordon's played almost every snap. Braxton Jones at left tackle every snap. And Robinson with 130, the defensive end. So they kind of have rebuilt the team. Of course, they changed GMs, they changed coaches, and they needed a rebuild. And here they are in the middle of it, or at least the start of it. And I think with that youth, Matt Eberflus is trying to instill an aggressive mindset. That's why last week you saw him going for it. Tonight you're seeing him going for it on fourth down quite a bit. Here's McLaurin. Short gain up to the 28 as we come down toward the two-minute warning. Bill Doerr with the tackle on the play. You know, he's always coached. You go back and look at him as a defensive coordinator in college and the pros. He has defenses that always are aggressive run to the ball, and I think he's now trying as a head coach make sure the entire team embraces that approach. So we have played 28 minutes of Soldier Field in Chicago. Nothing. Nothing. Sleep this week. Second down and five. at the two-minute warning. Wentz into traffic and knocked away along the sideline. Vildor is there. Cam Sims looks for a flag. There is none. Third and five, and there is Wentz holding his hand. He came in. I've talked about that bicep strain, and now he's wringing out his throwing hand. Johnson on the other side. They decide to test the other side with Vildor, who kind of anticipates that throw right at the sticks. Gets his hand in there and there's the follow through. As he comes through, Justin Jones hits his hand. And you can see Wentz, as you mentioned there. We're working through that right now and a third down and five. Blitz coming. They pick it up. Pass is almost picked there. Looking for a flag and there is none Tyler Gordon is there Curtis Samuel now there is a flag Yep Flag at the 49 line Curtis Samuel the intended receiver is going to go against Chicago Pass interference. Defect. Number six. Ball is replaced at the final foul. Automatic touchdown. On Gordon, the rookie from Washington. An official right there. Maybe didn't have the angle, but he didn't call anything. And then the official in the back must have seen something. Let's see. As he gets away, Samuel pulls away. He runs into him, working back to the ball. But that looks like a clean play. Terry agrees. A clean play there by Gordon. He does. Got his head turned. So the ball now at the 45-yard line. And that is incomplete. And that's almost picked on the carom. Intended for McKissick. It will be second down and ten. And there he is working on that hand. Keeping it warm. He's doing anything and everything he can. Probably see a quarterback doing that. When you're in the house, you bump your elbow and hits that funny bone. Gives you that numbness, that feeling in your hand. He's just trying to loosen it up. Moving that wrist around. And the biceps strained. Yeah. And right now he's 5 of 11 for 57 yards. It's second down and 10. Hangs in the pocket. Fires. Flag thrown. That pass very high intended for McLaurin. Was it even catchable was the question. And they had to call it on the off end road. For the moment it looked like they were. But now. on Jalen Johnson and the crowd obviously came to training camp and you've got to feel great for the kid yeah I've known him for a long time since he was a young player down in Tuscaloosa playing for Nick Saban around a lot of talented backs had to wait his turn and it's great to see him back that takes us to the end of the first quarter on Thursday night Carson, he hit our tight end over the middle for about a 20-yard gain, so we've got to build on that success. Are you concerned at all about Carson Wentz's shoulder? We've seen him in between series, stretching it out. What do you see from him? No, for the most part, all he's trying to do is keep it loose, you know, so it doesn't tighten him, especially in his cold air. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Kaylee. Second down and five. That pass is thrown behind J.D. McKissick. Third down and five. On Thursday, 6-0, 15 touchdowns, two picks. And he takes the snap here. Here comes the blitz. And he avoids it for the moment. But then Roquan Smith came straight through the middle, almost unimpeded, and takes him down his fourth down. They confuse him because they walk up on third down. Look at this. They have five on the front. Freeze up the blitz here. Miscommunication. You can see the center there who's trying to adjust and make sure he's making the right call, Tyler Larson. and it frees up one of the better linebackers in this league, especially blitzing Roquan Smith for his third sack of the year. Wentz now the most sacked quarterback in the league. That's 22. Trestway with his second punt. First one was 58 yards. It's a bouncing ball fielded at the 25. And Jones brings it back out to the 30-yard line. And we'll be back in 30 seconds. Little Herbert is now the running back. He's had some good performances this season. Averaging six yards per carry. And you can see why here. Breaking tackles. Herbert into Washington territory. Fields is down there to help block. Gets inside the 20. Cuts it back. First and goal from the 7. Braxton Jones got all the way down there. Cometa's run. You saw Fields in the picture. Looking to throw a block. 62 yards for Herbert. The Bears keep attacking the perimeter in the run game. Getting great blocks. And it's just a back being special. Not giving up on a play. Being able to get to the back side. And then he shows his speed. And as you said, Justin Fields, the quarterback, downfield hustling to try to make a key block. Herbert's second year back out of Virginia Tech. spot the ball at the six yard line first and goal Herbert stays in the fake to him flag is thrown fields for the moment able to avoid contact pushed out of bounds and we'll get the call here the commanders may have 12 on the field it looked like if they do it'll be first and goal from the three got another flag here at the end of the play. There's 12. There were 12 on the field. Flag came from the back judge under the goal post. And that's it. 12-minute formation. Defense. Passes the Super Bowl in the final spot. Replay. Worked out. Rivera argues his case. Check it out. There it is. The Dirty Dozen. A lot of Fields' athletic ability, though. I mean, just this place. That's Jonathan Allen right there. See the flag thrown. Yes, you did. Right there in your face. All right, they've been down here. Let's see if they can get a touchdown. They were down before. Fields threw an interception. This time they give the ball to Herbert. And he'll get taken down after a minimal deed, if any. Montez Sweat is right there. It'll be second and goal. With Allen and Payne and that interior, you would think the way they're running to the edge and getting the ball to the outside, whether you run the ball and try to just do it with a back, or you count on Justin Fields, who is so dangerous when he gets outside, with the option to run or throw, you'd think they're going to have to work the edges here against this defense. Take the Herbert Fake end around And incomplete Trying to go to Ryan Griffin The tight end a little too long Third down and goal That's everything you want Perfectly designed play Fake up the middle Fake the reverse to St. Brown and then just put it up in the air and let your tight end. The offense is bright. Well-designed play. And then you have the quickness to be able to get upfield pretty quickly by Antonio Gibson. Beautiful design. Turner with the block into Chicago territory at the 48-yard line. Look to Gibson and throws over the middle. Pick up here. Wentz hurting his hand in the first half. He came in with a bicep strain to begin with. He was on the injury report. And then this. Ever since that, he's just been working that hand, twisting his wrists around just like that. I've seen a lot of that. Kaylee talked with Ron Rivera. It's not enough to keep him out. But on a cold night, not an easy thing to work through for a winch. But this drive has a little bit more urgency to it than some of their previous drives. Second and five, off to play fake, good protection. Pass is caught, that's another first down to the 34-yard line, goes Gibson. Roquan Smith makes the tackle there as we come down to about five minutes left in the third in a four-point game. Nobody knows Carson Wentz better than Allen Williams, the defensive coordinator, and Iberflus, the head coach, because they were with him in Indy last year. One of the things they want to challenge him with is, is he willing to check it down? He has a reputation of wanting to take chances downfield, that time a good check down. Gibson again. He takes the ball to the 31-yard line. Smith making that tackle. Dean at three, second at seven. I have a unique situation with Iberflues and Williams and their recognition, knowledge, seeing Carson Wentz last year in practice, knowing some of his tendencies, watching him in games, and now a year later putting a defense together to try to defend him in two different teams. Oh Wentz repositioning Sims and Samuel comes to the outside close lock it to Give it to Gibson again Great drive for him as he takes you to the 21 they've been going with Robinson for the most part But all of a sudden with Gibson now four carries 32 yards eight yards per tote bringing in fresh legs and running with a little bit of an attitude here once he gets north and south. Good job of feeling that and then getting behind that block by Charles Leno. All three of these backs, Gibson, McKissick, and Robinson, all bring something a little bit different to the table. Gibson catching the ball quite a bit. Along with McKissick, Robinson is supposed to be the thumper, but right now we're seeing Gibson do a pretty good job. this drive started back at their own 25 yard line that's Samuel in the backfield fake toss to him, low throw caught Gibson again, spins his way all the way to the 16 yard line that unique formation definitely caught the eye of the Bears defense and then a little option look Gibson's lined up right next to him he'll move his way out to the left look at the option look at the defense, linebackers respond And now you've got leverage. Now you have a chance. Ball's thrown a little bit low and behind him. If that's upfield, he picks up good yards. On a second and five. Robinson is back in there now. And he's very close to a first down. Popped there by Brisker at the end of the play. Rookie on rookie. Good blocking on that left side. His offensive line starting to put things together. Terry McLaurin. Love to see receivers who make so many plays catching the ball. willing to get involved in the run game. He does a nice job of keeping Jalen Johnson out of there. Now you've got a shot here on third and short. Third and one. 215 left in the third. Ninth play of the drive. Four runs, four passes to this point. Out of the pistol. Samuel going back and forth. Now Robinson, and he'll take the ball for a first down. Things are opening up on that left side. You know, we were concerned about the middle of the commander's offensive line. Leno, the left tackle, former Bear, does a good job of pushing Quinn to the outside. And then you just cut right underneath that with Robinson. So he mixed it in different backs, some misdirection, just some different looks here. And there's second possession here in the second half. first and goal right at the 10th 10th play of the drive little flip to sandal too long you got Schofield going over to take the spot of Patrick at least for one play fake toss here fields on the run throws caught and into Washington territory goes Mooney. So the Bears on the move. Again, run to the perimeter and then play action on early downs. You work him from the left all the way back, and this is a good job by Fields. Instead of trying to make a play downfield right away, he sees his guy Mooney underneath and gets the ball out of his hands. It gives him a chance to do something with the ball after the catch. Mooney now six catches for 65 yards. Fields 10 of 18. Hand the ball off here to St. Brown. And a nice tackle is there. Kind of turned around the corner. Kendall Fuller comes up to trip him up after getting a one. Yeah, they challenged Fuller there. They just said, okay, we're going to go with the corner and see if the corner wants to tackle. Bears go no huddle. Pick up the pace here. Fields deep down field. And the AD is going to be caught for a touchdown. Dante Pettis. Threw it over. Kendall Fuller, but Fields is down. So he's sure, shake it up again. He got a flag that's thrown. He got a 40-yard for the moment touchdown. Fields gets back up. Did a little breathing there and got up, it looks like. But the flag is too many men on the field. He had a free play there with that hurry up. Now the question is, does he get his feet in? Of course, all scoring plays reviewed. Here's Pettis. Great catch. Looks like he got them both as long as he has possession of the ball. That's a touchdown. How about the throw by Justin Fields? Tremendous. Drops it over the outside shoulder away from that defender to give Pettis a chance. They get those two feet down. Sensational. So Pettis, whose dad is the third base coach and former outfielder, third base coach for the Houston Astros, had a great career with California with the Angels, when they were the California Angels. And here's Cairo Santos now. I thought you were going to do a dance, not Pettis. I did. Touch the Irish jig here. Touch that. I forgot how to call him. And the kick is good. Well, what do you know? How do you do? Justin Fields to Pettis. Down goes Fields. But Pettis goes in for six and a seven to three. on the sideline, making sure that they don't want to take him to the sideline as they check out the video here. And there he is. He's been taking a lot of shots as we go back to the touchdown. This is a reminder of what Justin Fields can do. Sweat on the left going against the rookie Jones. Again, gets pushed right back into him as he releases the ball. Not only does he keep his vision, he takes that hit. Location of the football there to Pettis. great throw, great job by Fields and he reminds everybody this is why they keep hanging with me in this offense because of the ability to make throws like that now Wentz who is 5 of 14 to the outside and starts with a first down on this drive McLaurin picks up 11 Let's see if Wentz has an answer. Started off with a run pass option. Gets the ball out quickly to McLaurin with the defense. Just loaded up in the box to stop the run. Good recognition. Flips it out there to his top target for easy yards. Ready. Yeah. Gibson Nice run there Gibson picks up a first down So a good start For the commanders on this drive It's a gain of 18 for Antonio Look at this, overload the right side And then you're going to motion with Turner And actually motion here And then bring Turner back the other way So you have to get all the defense Playing in the slot That's where he played the majority of the time out at Washington. He's 6'202 pounds. I mean, he's physical. He's not afraid to come up. Run support, good eyes, good vision, and not afraid at all of those big tight ends matching up with him. I know people are picking on him early because he's a young player, but you watch him closely. He looks like he's got a bright future in this secondary. Third and five. going deep downfield coverage is there the pass is incomplete trying to get it to Deami Brown second year man out of North Carolina who had two touchdown receptions last week Jalen Johnson has missed the last three games with an injury quad injury covering and now it's so good to see 33 back for this defense we just talked about him on that last third down this time it is Deami Brown who's known for his vertical ability to get downfield and I think someone did their homework, Jalen Johnson. Stride for stride, in phase there. Nice job on that third down. Dressway, his third punt of the night. Angles it to the left side, but bounces there. And rolls to a stop at the 22 yard line. Eight minutes to go in the first half. Chicago. Your kind of town on a Thursday night. Minnesota. This is as good as it gets. Oh, that's beautiful. Darnell Mooney. That was a gigantic play, too. They were down by 18. And then earlier on, on Thursday night, we had this one with Pickens. That's pretty good, too, right? Pittsburgh against Cleveland. The fact he held on to that when he hit the ground. You know, you go back and you watch the old films of games and all that stuff, and guys never made catches like that. And I'm not saying Beckham was the first, But when Beckham made that catch on Sunday Night Football, it changed everything. And now guys just practice it all the time. They do. They practice catching more with one hand than they do with two. From the 23-yard line on first down, Fields, play fake, throws, caught. Speaking of Mooney, there he is, his 12th catch of the season. First down. And keep in mind, this is an offense that runs the ball 60% of the time. So on first and ten, that's the time to throw because you get one-on-one opportunities. Your best target, Mooney, on a comeback route against St. Juice, who's moving from slot to the outside last week and still getting comfortable out there. Good call again by Getze. Tosh to Montgomery. Picks a couple halfway through the second quarter. We go to Kaylee. Al, I asked Darnell Mooney if he'd ever made a one-handed catch like that before, and he said ever so casually, yeah, I caught one in pregame. Look at that. Same side, same angle on Sunday. He practices those catches often. He even has a jugs machine at home. Yes, that's in his living room. When the temperature drops in Chicago, he takes it inside. And in terms of what catch was more impressive, he actually gave the honor to George Pickens. That's interesting. I thought there was a coin flip. I think it was how he landed and held on to the ball was pretty. You've got to give him points for that. But Mooney, and I saw him on the field. Actually, you came down on the field today. And I know you've done it forever. But for this year, this is the first time. And next thing you know, 20-mile-an-hour win, back upstairs. And you came back up too. Come on. I did. But down there, we saw him down there. He's at least 173. Right. I don't know if he's that big. And out there performing and being a great player in this league. Third down and three from the 44-yard line. Fields airs it out for Mooney and incomplete. The coverage is there. Crowd calls for a flag. Won't get one. Rashad Wild Goose covering on the plate's fourth down. And I know he's got an opportunity to get this to Mooney down here. But look at the crosser. Remember the down and distance. Situational football. Think about that right there. That's a first down. You don't always have to go to your matchup. Think about the down and distance. Crosser coming across that field with nobody picking him up. You dump it there, and you move the sticks. Trenton Gill, his second punt of the night. first was 53 yards if this goes that distance it's in the end zone try to angle it nose down tries to put some backspin on it and it's caught at the 17 yard line fields pressured avoids the sack gets around the corner skids out of bounds with 37 ticks chased out by Payne second down You have all three timeouts. You have a quarterback that is still trying to find his way. I wondered when they got the ball whether Iberflus would decide to go for it or just get out of here at the half. But getting out of bounds, probably still give him another chance here. So the Bears tonight, 116 yards on the ground, 56 in the air. Second and 10. Fields. A little pressure again. Gets tripped up. Tackled at the 29-yard line. Jonathan Allen tripping him. Clock stops. Time out. 30 seconds. Just a thought. I've watched college football and the NFL kind of merge offensively with schemes. You know, look what Greg Roman's done with Lamar Jackson in Baltimore. You look what Kyler Murray's doing. You look all around the league. Mahomes with Andy Reid, who grew up in the West Coast offense. And instead of trying to predict, let's make these college quarterbacks fit into our NFL system, what a lot of these guys are saying is, you know what, I'm going to bend my system to their skill set. And right now you have a pro system here with Luke Getze, who's trying to get his quarterback, Justin Fields to adjust to an NFL system. You wonder at some point along the way if you try to adjust Fields or allow Fields to, maybe his skill set, to run a different kind of a system in an attack. They're 0 for 5 on third down. They're third and six here. Fields is going to take off. And Fields to the 40-yard line. But that took 12 seconds, so they've got 18 seconds left. And timeout here. And meanwhile, Jonathan Allen is down on one knee back at the 19-yard line. This is a matchup zone here where they're going to end up playing a lot of man-to-man. And you always, when you play man-to-man, you've got to be careful because if Fields doesn't go down and you don't spy him, and with his skill, he's going to be able to make some yards and pick up first downs. Right now, I think what he's most comfortable with when receivers are covered in man-to-man, he's got room to run. That timeout was charged to Washington because Allen was down on one knee, needed the extra time, comes hobbling off here. So the Bears, for what it's worth, still have two timeouts, but 18 seconds remain in its own 40-yard line. Can they get into field goal range is the question. There's Chase Young, the great defensive lineman, third season, but he had ACL surgery last November and still hasn't played this season yet. from their own 40. Fields with a man right in his face, and the pass is incomplete. Second down and 10, and Fields is down. It's Deron Payne with the pressure there on Fields. Right through the middle, Allen goes out, and Allen, along with Payne, or a dangerous combo, is off to just the outside of the left guard, and watch how quick he uses those hands, gets penetration right into the middle there as Fields tries to throw that football. He's known for his power, but shows great quickness there. And Washington put a tremendous emphasis on building that defensive line, paying one of their number one draft picks back in 2018. Fields again has to move away, throw, caught, 46-yard line to the 45, but you've got four seconds now, and the clock is stopped there, Fields is down again. Catch made by Pettis. So Fields, slow in getting up the last time and trying to get to his feet right now. He took a hit there as he threw the ball by Jamin Davis, who was spying him. And we just saw a play where they didn't spy him. This time they do, which opens up the middle of the field, but he gets hit as he throws the ball. So he finally, he gets up. He has to come out for at least one play. Trevor Simeon is the backup quarterback. What's he going to do here with five seconds? Meanwhile, because they take the time out, Fields can stay in the game. He didn't take the time out. He'd have to come out of the game. He took the time out so he can stay in. Man, he's got to use all that yoga right now, huh? Absolutely. All that breathing. Hell yeah. Yeah. See, first down and goal. Bayless Jones. Rookie out of Tennessee. Drafted him in the third round. How about Equinemius Brown? Again, good blocking on the outside. You had commit, the tight end getting out front. And then 19 receiver, both doing a good job on the perimeter, which gave Jones enough room to pick up that first down. They love to run. 4-1 ratio inside the 20-yard line. Montgomery. Nothing. Cameron Curl comes in there. Three minutes to go in the quarter. Second and goal for Chicago. Commanders are trying to figure out their secondary. As Luke Getze tries to find the right player to get this ball into the end zone. They don want to settle for a field goal On the back end Cam Curl been great They ended up moving Benjamin St Juice to the outside ahead of William Jackson And Wild Goose your guy into the slot So finding the right pieces on the back end. But boy, Camp Curl's been a good addition helping out. Wild Goose is your guy too. Come on. Great. Fabulous name. Second down and goal. Fields. That's not in the air. and the commanders come down with it. They do. So deflected up into the air and a pickoff at the five-yard line. That's Jonathan Allen who comes down with the interception. Of all people, the leader, the alpha for the commanders off the helmet and into the air and the awareness there by Allen to make the play. The five-yard line equanimous ground out to the flat. This is man-to-man. They're trying to freeze somebody up. He gets out wide. Tough for the commanders to get out there in coverage. Look right here at Komet. Separation. That's where he was going. That's where he was throwing. And the big tight end did get separation, but he just couldn't get it through. That big defensive line. It goes right off of the helmet there of Bada and into the hands of Jonathan Allen. that is only the second takeaway of the season for the commanders and the first since opening day. Comes at a very opportune time. Stops the drive. In a goal-to-go situation. And a nice run here by the flag. Robinson gets it out to the 12-yard line. Stopped by Smith. And it's coming back. So from the six, they'll take it back to the three. A little formation, offense. Number 17, covered up number 88, and the man on the line of scrimmage went in motion. Half the distance to a goal, replay first out. Caught some three yards, makes it first, and 13. Ron Rivera checking out the replay. Nine years as the Carolina head coach took him to the Super Bowl. with a record of 15-1 following the 2015 season where they lost to Peyton Manning and the Broncos. First and 13, looking for some space here. And Robinson takes it up to the 5-yard line. So Wentz's numbers thus far, through the first 5 games of the season, the pass rating is about the league average, but sacked 20 times, third most in the league. completion percentage at 63. Seventh year in the league. Of course, at one point with Philadelphia led up to an 11-2 mark in 17. Torn ACL. And the next thing you know, they're building a statue to Nick Foles outside the league. That's right. Three teams in three years. Second and 10. Fired. Caught. Nice grab over the middle. Taken there by Cole Turner. Rookie out of Nevada. This is a great throw because you've got a safety in the middle of the field. You've got to get back and throw it to a spot now. Get it out and get it on a line. Puts it right where his tight end can climb the ladder and make a play. Great job by Turner at 6'6", 240. He knew Eddie Jackson was going to blast him, but good concentration and good placement by Wentz. Wentz was on the injury list this week. strained right biceps look good on that throw here's Robinson again going to the outside it's taken down up to the 29 yard line so a heavy dose of Robinson here of course you know what happened to him at the beginning you don't know you don't know if it ends his football career I was scared to death of course Ron went to see him right away in the hospital one of the teammates visited So that negates what would have been another first down. That makes it now first and 15 at the 44. Have a pullback in the game. Last game. Give the ball to Montgomery. Gets around the corner. Then gets it out to the 49. The Bears, I mentioned before, most rushing yards. I said in 22 years. I meant 32 years. But time flies. You know that. Yeah. And I was going to ask you, 82 Patriots. Is that Steve Grogan? Who's 82 Patriots? I think it was, yeah. And Matt Cavanaugh was there, too, at that point. Okay. And a strike year as well, right? Yeah. He had a strike earlier in the year, finished the season. I think each team played around nine games, second and eight. Fields buys time. Fires. That's caught on the run. And to the 30-yard line goes Dante Pettis. So halfway through the quarter, Bears on the move right here. That's a gain of 19. Pettis is here, works here, and then just kind of feels the quarterback. This time Justin Fields does a nice job. Comes off this, looks downfield, waits to the last second, and then delivers the ball. Pettis does a really good job of feeling the leverage, working back to the other side to get away from coverage, making eye contact and Fields delivers it. He fields three of his first four. Rolling again. Packs it in. Takes it to the 25-yard line for a short game. How about our guy Darnell Mooney, 5'11", 173, out there helping out. We're used to him making great plays with his hands and feet. Instead, he's taking on the big man on the outside. Watch this. Look at this. Good job. Just kind of mirror the big man. All you do is give Justin Fields a little bit of room. It's a good effort there. High weighs 173. We've got in front of the 250-pound Casey Tuhill. Second and five. Nice hole, but stopped a nice tackle here. And for a gain of a couple by Rashad Wild Goose. Always wanted to see it. And he got it in. He got it in early. Jack Del Rio is the defensive coordinator. nine years was the Jacksonville Jaguars head coach three years at Oakland another DC under Rivera came with Ron back three years ago third and three quick pass out here Mooney and he'll be with that second effort maybe got it looked like he was stopped behind the line of scrimmage but was able to thrust forward you're going to spot it right there McCain makes the tackle Looking at the change right now And they're going to say short of the line to Dean So they call it, don't need to measure They're going to go for it on fourth and inches on the 20 yard line And Fields is going to take it himself And with forward progress, we'll be able to net the first down Oh, man. Lucas Patrick's trying to take care of his guy, protect his quarterback. Just need a few inches here. Watch the left guard. A good push. Athletic quarterback who's strong, easily picks up the first down, and somehow Patrick grabs a hold of him, just keeps shoving him to get out of that pile. I love what Luke Getze's been doing here as a play caller. mixing in a lot of early down passes on a run heavy offense trying to break some trends here four runs, three passes on these seven plays here goes Montgomery and he's able to move to the 14 yard line and a little shoving and pushing Durant Payne is right there knocking over Sam Mustapher Mustapher gave him a little push and then Payne reacted to it and as we always see usually It's the reaction that gets flagged. Must have done a pretty good job of watch 67, a little push. Payne says, uh-uh, uh-uh. And then the good acting job there by the big man, Tim Burr. Down he goes. Very good. If he wouldn't have done that much acting, he might have actually gotten the call. Right. Instead, no flag. Second down and five. And around. Jones. Phelis Jones. Got into the end zone last week. and takes it down to the five-yard line. So it's a one play. Can he launch one here? From the 45. Looking downfield. He will launch one. A lot of action in the end zone there, and it is broken up at the very end. For a moment, it looked like it might be caught in the end zone, but to the turf it drops, and that takes us to the half. with Washington leading Chicago. 3-0. Mercedes-Benz halftime show next. And the Commanders will get the ball to start the second half. Commanders trying to snap a four-game losing streak. The Bears 2-3 coming in. Trying to make it 3-0 in Soldier Field. And off we go in the second half. It'll be run back here by Antonio Gibson from just inside the end zone. He comes back out to the 25 and lead go to Keely. Wow, we saw Justin Fields shaking up at the end of the first half. Matt Eberfuss tells me he is good to go now. He did not receive any treatment during the half. He acknowledged those two big drives that they had, but they just couldn't punch him in. He said in the second half they have got to execute him. He said we are looking for explosive passes to get on the board, Al. They can only hope so, sort of like what Mooney did last week to get them kick-started in Minnesota. But tonight thus far feels 7-14 for 89. So Wentz keeping that hand that was shaken at the end of the first half in that warmer as long as he can. And they start here with a Robinson run. And he breaks the tackle, but only for a 4-yard pickup up to the 29-yard line. giving Robinson a chance tonight. Trying to find more balance. These first five weeks, it's really been on Wentz's shoulders and the talented group of wide receivers. They just felt, as the season has gone on, talking to them this week, they just felt that it was a matter of getting Robinson healthy and ready to go and trying to become more physical at the line of scrimmage and mixing that along with Wentz and the passing game. Robinson and he fights his way for what should be a first down and will be Smith knocks him out of bounds at that point they picked him in bounds they picked up the first down they're out Roquan Smith from Georgia Robinson from Alabama two SEC guys and that is tough physical running by Robinson to get that first down Remember, the Bears have struggled this year defending teams from running the football. They're second to last in the league, and I think that's why you're seeing the commanders stick to their guns and continue to try to establish the run. They're averaging about four and a half per carry are the commanders. From the 36-yard line, coming around the end, McLaurin takes a real shot, gets to the 42-yard line. And that's Eddie Jackson who comes up there, number four, to take him down. That ball looked like it may have popped out. That's what Eddie Jackson was thinking. He's in the middle of the field where he always is, and he's just kind of roaming back there trying to figure out run pass. He sees his run, and watch how quick he is. A lot of people want to talk about Eddie Jackson now and how long he's been playing in six years. The ball did come out. Yeah, he does get lucky, too. Bounced right off the shoulder and back down, but he's still showing the physicality even in his sixth year. Gain a six, second down and four. Cutting it back. Antonio Gibson sets up a third and two. Last couple of games. Last week, one of 11 against the Titans. Tonight, one out of six, Scott Turner. Father Norv, of course, longtime NFL coach, calling the plays. That's as much a reflection of the offensive line as much as anything, struggling to give Wentz time. Third and two. Wentz. And he'll go down. Gets to the outside, gets out of the pocket. Now Kadeem Mohamed with the tackle right there. It's fourth down. Unlike Fields, there's just not a threat of Wentz when he comes off the action and gets outside. You just don't feel that. Look at the coverage downfield. Doubling downfield. They take away McLaurin. Just run underneath it. It just misses it. Perfect execution. Could not be any better. And then just put it up. Put it up in the air. and let the big man just get underneath the ball. Third and goal now. Fields. Surveying. He'll take off. Can he get in? And he'll get stopped just shy of the goal line. Inside the one. Derek Forrest and Bobby McCain converge on it. Of course, the crowd wants them to go for it. You and I want them to go. We want to see a touchdown. They will. But how about this? They spy him. You know if Fields doesn't see his primary, he becomes a running back. Lowers his shoulder. He's not sliding. He's trying to get the ball into the end zone. And there's the safety. He's trying to keep an eye on him. Keep him short. Fields under center. Fourth and goal. Herbert. Can he get in? No signal yet. Washington thinks they have stopped him. and for the moment it appears they have go figure can't get it in and we remain scoreless pushed down by this offensive line and then 55 fills it along with 90 to keep him short good job let that defensive line those big guys eat up all the linemen and then you can see how quickly it gets filled by Holcomb and Sweat. Total frustration for Chicago. Twice inside the 5-yard line. They gave it 133 yards and have nothing to show for it. Now they need some breathing room here. Antonio Gibson is the back. Put a full back in the game as well and give it to the up back and he's able to take it to the 2-yard line. Speaking of breathing room, so here is Justin Fields. Told us yesterday He's into yoga and breathing, and he breathes in for four to six seconds, and then breathes out. In for four. Out. After four. He told us six, though, yesterday. Yeah, he did six. You practiced, and you said six is tough. That's what he said. Six is very tough. Along with most plant-based diet is tough. He's a vegan. I said, man, you're in Chicago. Go have a porterhouse. He lives in Chicago, but he's plant-based. Come on, man. Oh, man. Pistol formation here Robinson is the back And they give it to him And he'll take it out to the 5 yard line If nothing else gives the punter at least some room If they have to kick it Brian Robinson Jr. The NFL's journey for him hometown Tuscaloosa, Alabama Which is the home of the University of Alabama And that's where he went to school Stayed right at home backed up Josh Jacobs, Damian Harris, and Maji Harris. So, didn't get a lot of action early on. Third round pick last year. Debut last Sunday. Nine carries, 22 yards. And tonight, eight, six carries for 16 yards. Third down, five. McKissick is the back. And that's caught for a first down. and all the way after the 23-yard line goes Terry McLaurin, their number one back fourth year out of Ohio State, and a first down for Washington. Jalen Johnson is back in the lineup, which is good news for the Bears, but good against good here. He just loses his footing on a quick slant. Actually gives a cushion on third down, and it gave McLaurin plenty of room. Wentz is like, thank you very much. I'll hit my favorite target and get out of the shadow of my own goal line and get a first down. 23-yard line. Rolling out. Intended for Gibson and nearly picked. Gibson sent out into the flat. Kyler Gordon, rookie out of University of Washington, is right there. Second down. First two picks in last year's draft by the Bears. Both defensive backs. Briscoe out of Penn State and Kyler Gordon out of Washington, and who's developing quite a reputation for defensive backs that go on to play in the NFL. What's interesting is Chicago really needed more offense. They traded away their number one pick in the fields deal, and then they go defense with their first two picks. Second down and 10 at the 23-yard line. To the outside. Caught up to the 27-yard line. Cole Turner, he's seeing more action. Their number one tight end, Logan Thomas, injured and inactive. Gordon has good quickness. He's used by no. Six minutes to go to the half. From the 17. To the outside. With Lauren. And he picks up about 12. I love seeing that video of Jaws and Roger Staubach. Joe Heisman, those late 70s NFC East was really good battles. Of course, back in that era, you were either a Steelers fan nationally or a Cowboys fan. Seemed like most people. Who did you idolize going up? In that era, where I grew up in Ohio, Bengals were not a great team. Browns weren't great. I loved the Cowboys. Roger Stalbach. How could you not? Sure. The perfect choice. Nice hole, but it closes rapidly. Robinson, a heavy dose of him tonight. As he has now carried seven times for 19 yards. After last week getting the nine carries, after everything he went through, you figured if he came back from that okay, he was going to get more and more opportunities. He's such a physical runner, downhill, 230-pounder. Under five to go to the half. Wentz. Caught. Slipping. Curtis Samuel makes the grab there. We go to Kaylee. Well, Al, Brian Robinson is a fighter. His assistant running back coach, Jennifer King, told me she knew that about him watching his career at Alabama unfold. That guy had to wait until his fifth year there to get on the field because of the guys in front of him. She said a lot of other kids in that position would have transferred, but he didn't. He had the determination and the will, and she says she saw that through those 42 days it took him to get back on the field for his debut. Heavy dose of him tonight, but he comes out for the moment, and J.D. McKissick comes in on a third down and four. looks coming gets it away and that's incomplete pressure put on that time little bit covering on the play it's fourth down well muhammad comes off the edge and i'll tell you alan williams is bringing the pressure brings pressure here but it frees up the edge pressure from muhammad and watch watch 11 back up as he throws it like he knows that this third down package that the Bears have put together is starting to impact him, his confidence, and his offensive line and their protection. They're really getting after him with a lot of different looks. Fourth putt for Tressway. Fair catch called for. Made at the 21-yard line by Gore in the 21-yard line. And this is Herbert to the outside. He goes. He had that 62-yard run. You know, Kirk, the lead-wide scoring average is 43.7 this year. Total points in the game. Lowest in 2010. But this is carrying it to an extreme. Yeah, this is going to a whole other level. And we had two opportunities tonight with the Bears down to the five-yard line and inside the five and came away with an interception or turnover on downs. Second and nine. Mooney makes the catch. Go! Tackled by Jamin Davis. So you're underwhelmed, basically. Yeah. But I think the Bears are at least moving the ball. We've been all over fields tonight about maturing and growing. That last decision, it's not a wow play, but you're just looking for small signs of growth. And that last play, it was a run-pass option. He could have run it up the middle or flipped it to the outside. at least gives him a chance here now on third and four. You know I put the emphasis on Andre. You're doing it. I know you do. Third down and four. Fields into traffic and almost picked Mooney, the intended receiver. Kendall Fuller, one of four Fuller brothers to play in the National Football League, covering on the play fourth down. Fields gets back, and he's got to be able to get comfortable in putting the foot down, hitch, and then getting the ball out. He waits, waits, feels the pressure, allows the pressure to get to him, and then throws the ball behind his receiver. Fields now 6 of 11 for 74 yards. Bears are 0 for 5 on third down. Hunt fielded at the 19 by Milne. You can't be any closer than that. Yeah, and I'm really curious, and it doesn't matter, but the left elbow comes down out of bounds. Right there. It's irrelevant. And Fields put it where if Mooney holds on to the ball, it's a catch. And he bobbles it. Yep. Could have been out of bounds before he even caught it. Even had he held on to it across the goal line. So, Washington, if nothing else, you take an intentional safety. You could. But you don't want to if you can get it out of there. And they do. And now they can take that clock all the way down to triple zeros. And Moody's his guy, right? I mean, if he goes up and secures the ball, which is tough. He's in the air. I mean, you've got to try to make a play. But he gave him a chance. Moody just bobbled it. Good defense. Comes so close. Yeah, Pettis almost gets the catch. Moody almost makes the catch. And Carson Wentz, if nothing else, he loves Thursday night football. He's now 7-0 on Thursday night. And these games continue to just come down. to the one or two plays. It seems like every weekend we sit around and watch NFL football. It's one or two plays that decide the outcome. And for Justin Fields and the Bears, they drop to 2-4. And Washington goes to 2-4 as they snap a four-game skid. Final play for the Bears. Mooney. The elbow is out of bounds anyway. That close. 12-7 is our final score. Washington wins it over the Chicago Bears. Post-game show with Carissa and... See if he'll check it down to his outlet consistently, or is he going to take a chance and maybe throw it into coverage? Third and six. Wentz has thrown for only 94 yards tonight. Going to get the six he needs here to get him to triple figures. Nope. Only the 40-yard line. Antonio Gibson makes that catch. And it's fourth down. And Lynch looks to the bench. Will the offense stay in? And they will, at least for the moment. The 42-yard line. Big one. Yep, fourth and a short two-long one. Take your pick. Gibson is the back. or is he just trying to draw them offside yeah play clock is 4-3 and kicking on down that's what they wanted to do just draw them offside don't even come close and now the puck group comes in with 8-18 on the clock five yard penalty trash way now with his sixth punt of the night he's averaging 50 yards per boot Jones stands back inside his 20 good boot fielded dropped at the 10-yard line and a scramble for it at the 5-yard line and who got it Jones gave it up Reeves says we have it meaning Washington So does Mayo And the officials say you are correct Who is at the bottom of that pile? I think it's Christian Holmes, the rookie out of Oklahoma State. Oh, my gosh. Loses sight. Balance to the left here. 34 gets in there and takes it away from Jones. to recover it. Gee, Jones having trouble. And a gigantic mistake right there. Meanwhile, two turnovers now for Chicago. Washington came into the game with one takeaway all season in five games. And they catch the break that they needed here late in the game. Now you see if Wentz and his offense can capitalize and try to punch it in. So Jones can only say a small prayer right now on that bench with a first and goal. And 8.06 left in the fourth. See Justin Fields coming over there talking to him. Just trying to help keep Jones, keep his head up. I think that's the big difference in his team, as young as they are. Justin Fields last year with Andy Dalton and some other vets around, didn't really feel it was his place, and now feels it is in his second year. Brian Robinson in the backfield. Samuel in motion. Give it to Robinson. To the outside he goes. Wentz throws a block, and Robinson takes the ball. to the one-yard line. Wentz took Roquan Smith out of the play. We just started talking about Roquan Smith, how great he's been all night. I don't think he expected 11. This ball bounces, and it's a crack block, right? By the way, he is a big man. 6'5", 238 pounds. Unloading into Roquan Smith. With that non-throwing shoulder, too. important second and goal Robinson and he will get into the end zone for a touchdown so two months ago the kid is wondering can he play again after he was shot twice in a carjacking attempt and here he is in Soldier Field taking it into the end zone. Good for Robinson and good for this left side of this offensive line. Watch the center, Tyler Larson. 16. They're down to two, but if they can stop on two plays and then the two-minute warning comes along, that's exactly what they need right now. Robinson starts to stumble. Take him down. Call the timeout right here. Second down. Check in with Kaley. Al, Brian Robinson was back in the commander's position. First of all, you just hope that he's okay and he can live his life. Here he is back playing football after August 28th being shot twice. Right, less than two months. Gets his first touchdown of the night. Second and nine. And they're able to stop him at the 33. So now you take a timeout here. You get another timeout, or will you? I guess they're going to take it on the other side of it. Either way. 200 warning here. They have one timeout on the other side. Even a field goal will keep it a one possession game. Chicago with one timeout. They figure to take it if they stop them here. And they do at the 30-yard line with Gibson stop there. So that took six seconds. 154. And with a field goal here. remains a one-possession game with an eight-point lead. I wondered if they would kick the field goal to potentially go up eight or punt it and pin them again with this offense and how they've struggled. Well, right now you're looking at a 48-yard attempt for Joey Slive. They came into the game, the commanders did They've kicked only two field goals all season long And Sly made them both from 38-28 He was bombing the ball in warm-ups Wins died down much easier now It has, yeah, for sure 48-yard attempt, fresh way to hold it Trying to make it 15-7. And he does not. So the Bears very much alive getting the ball from the spot where it was kicked from, 38. And the only reason I brought up, I mean, of course you want to go up by eight, but the field position and this offense, if you could pin them inside the five, make them have to drive and score a touchdown? Good point. He hits this on a line and hooks it right from where it go. Right. Just didn't have a chance. That is not wind-related. That's just hooking it. And now the Bears are at their own 38-yard line here to start this drive. Right. He needs 62 yards in a minute and 49 seconds. Fields 11 of 22 for 164. Low snap. Gathers it. and then it's knocked down, and Montgomery comes up with it. That's Jonathan Allen busting it up. That's a fumble. That clock is not stopping. They do not have timeouts. Allen gets in there. Back to where he fumbled it. Right at the 33-yard line. Second down, and the pass to the outside court. Out of bounds goes Pettis there, and it will be third down. Allen comes up with that sack and almost ends the game. Very fortunate for the Bears. Watch how quick he is right here. Just using quickness, power to get in there. Blindsiding fields. He goes down and Montgomery's able to bounce on it. Third and five. To the outside to Montgomery. He slips through to the 44. He goes. It's the difference when you get the ball thrown out quickly. not to a receiver, but Montgomery at 225 pounds and is very instinctive in the open field. A little over a minute. No timeouts for Chicago. Fields. Rolling left. First down and a lot more. Fields is inside the 20. Takes it to the 6. The worst thing that this defense can do is cover everybody downfield because that's where Fields is most dangerous. Everybody's covered. They underestimate what he can do. He's not going to run out of bounds. He's looking to make people miss and almost takes it to the end zone. 39 yards. Meanwhile, Jonathan Allen once again is down on the grass at the 38-yard line. So on the next play, they won't have Allen in the game. He has to come out for a perfect time to pull it on an early down and create a one-on-one matchup and try to win it. Bears with 190 ground yards, only 133 through the air. Montgomery again. Good run. Should have the first down. David Montgomery, tough, tough runner, always has been. Cameron Curl makes the stop there. First down for the home team. Right tackle, Borum, does a really good job. The right guard, Jenkins. And we talked about they were having success outside. Now they have some success to the inside. Take a look here. This play just kind of opens up, shows good patience, affect the eyes with the jet motion. And then he's able to lower his shoulder and get those tough yards. Here's a good play-action opportunity, I would think. Yep, so far, they pull it off, but the pass is incomplete because the pressure was really put on that time. Obata came in there. F.A. Obata made Fields get rid of it quickly. Yep. Second and ten. Obata does a good job of not biting on that at all. I think Fields hurried it a little bit. He didn't quite sell enough to affect Obata on the backside, so he's anticipating that play-action look. And then they had tight coverage with Cam Curl. So to the credit of the commanders, Jack Del Rio anticipating much of what we were saying, Maybe play action there on that first and ten. Ready for it. Six runs, one pass so far on the ground here. And then falling down is Smith-Morris. They gave it to him, but he runs into Montez Sweat and his own man as well. Crowd hates that call. Third and 11. Sweat is known for his ability to get upfield and rush the quarterback. I love how he defends the run. He recognizes that jet sweep because it got on him in a hurry. So he just holds the edge. Gets his upfield shoulder up. He's able to get that shoulder upfield and force him back in underneath, and he trips over his own linemen. Right. Braxton Jones, third and 11. Low throw. Pettis makes the catch. It only gets a couple of yards, or does he? They're going to say incomplete, so he doesn't even pick up the couple of yards. And now he's got a fourth down and 11. You've got 234. You're clearly out of field goal range. Not that that matters in this particular point. You've got to play what the game is right now, which is a five-point game. You've got all of your timeouts in the two-minute warning, but you're compelled really to go for it. That's the 43-yard line. Need 11 to keep the drive alive. And now you've got a whistle. And was the play clock all the way down? It was. Man, oh, man. You get a drop pass. And you're trying to figure out what to go with because the drop pass goes back to 4th and 11 instead of 4th and 6th. A little bit of confusion on getting it in. The execution. Now you drop a delay a game. five more yards back. And that's just the managing the game part. It can be very frustrating for the Bears. Fourth and 16. Have to get to the 32 to keep the drive alive. Fields surveying. Throws and not caught by Smith-Marsek. He was there. Couldn't hold on. He's the guy who fumbled last week at the end of the game in Minnesota. Showed him, causing them any opportunity to wind up coming from behind. And Washington will take over near midfield. 2.28 left in the fourth. The points next week. You would never break a promise. We'll see a lot of points next week. I can feel it. Now Washington, and they start here with a first down and a lot more, taking it to the 35-yard line. Brian Robinson breaking tackles along the way. So 15 carries for 57 yards. Gain of 15. I think the commanders have found themselves not just a back, but an offensive line. The sixth combination in six games. Look at that hole. I mean, it's late in the game. The left side opens that hole up beautifully, and he doesn't need a lot of room. But Norwell, who's been criticized a lot at left guard, is having a heck of a game with Leno opening things up. Tyler Larson making his first start of the year after tearing his Achilles last year at center. They've put together a group, and it hasn't been beautiful. But they are getting a push much better than any of the previous five games up front. And Chicago had to take a timeout there, meaning one. You repeat, this is why you go through the growing pains with a player at this position who is so physically gifted. You saw a throw earlier. He dropped in the bucket for the other touchdown to Pettis, and then the scramble with the game on the line to be able to make this play and now gives them a chance. Remember, they've been down inside this five-yard line twice. Right. And they turned it over on downs and they threw an interception. Fields has now run for 87 yards. No timeouts. So Allen out of the game. He was assisted off. First and goal. Quick snap. Fields. to the outside. He goes and he's out of bounds at about the four yard line. Flag has thrown Holcomb with the tackle. Flag is back at the 17th. Looked like Washington was actually trying to call a timeout. No foul in the play. The defense did not have a pair of work onto the field in the second half. They were trying to get a timeout. There were two different defenders that were trying to call a timeout. Holcomb right there. but the ball is snapped before he can get it, so they had ten guys on the field. Ten. And stopped him at the four, so it's second down and goal. 45 seconds. Again, get him on the edge, or the ball is out of his hands quick. Can't be back there holding on to the ball. And that's knocked down. 10-0 from Mooney. Third down and goal. Fields almost trying to catch his breath after all these plays. Good job of timing that up by Smith-Williams to knock it down. They had coverage out there on Mooney, but again, with his ability to create, he is so dangerous when he keeps the ball in his hands and gets outside. Jonathan Allen back in the game after missing a couple of plays. Third down and goal. Fields. Surveys. And then throws. And it's not caught by Pettis. Could not bring it in. And he's down. So Pettis has scored Chicago's touchdown. Somehow this ball gets to him. I didn't think it had a chance. He's back in the pocket. He just kind of floats it into the air. You're thinking, he's just throwing that ball away. They're fighting for it. Look at that. It gets to him. It's in his hands. It's Derek Forrest covering on the play. In his hands. Officials are now. He's down. Forrest is down. Right. He kept his hand in there. and Forrest is being assisted off the field and it's fourth down and goal. Back of a play by Forrest. Like I said, that ball somehow gets to Pettis. Pettis had one catch on the year. Right. Coming into tonight, and Fields has dialed him up seven times and he's caught four of them. He catches that one. He goes home a hero. He does. well there's the old as we once called it in Baltimore the manure chance of course they want the pass interference call but to me I saw Forrest head on the ball two guys fighting for the football so here's your game fourth and goal from the four fake toss to the end zone and it is juggled did he catch it no he did not incomplete mooney for the moment looked like he might have it does not you got st. juice covering on the play officials going over it how I think he called it A catch but not in. Catch but short of the goal line. By inches. Mooney goes up. Ooh, boy. When does he have control of it? Yeah, the ball goes up in the air. If he would have had it. It's bobbled. And by the time he gets control, he's back outside the goal line. St. Jude's covering on the play. So if he holds on to it there, he's across the goal line. He's in. But he doesn't. He gets control outside of the goal line. Hacks out there. John Ridgway, rookie out of Arkansas, comes in in pain spot to the outside. This time goes Khalil Herbert, who earlier had that 64-yard run. It'll be third down and eight now. He had a great line this week about trying to put a plan together and how to attack. He said, you know, those guys up front, man, they're game wreckers. You know, Payne and Allen. When you're dealing with two of them, it's not one, it's two. So you can see what his plan is. It's pretty easy. Run away from the interior and get the ball out on the edge. We have a chance. Lucas Patrick back in the game with left guard. He was shaking up at the end of the third as Fields hangs in there, breaks away, and that's what he does so well. Turns a sack into a game. Volcom chased him. First down. Again, they play matchup without a spy. So what's going to happen is you're going to see the underneath coverage essentially go into man-to-man. And I just don't understand the man-to-man look with an athletic quarterback without a spy because of that. That's your worst nightmare. They brought the pressure. They took a chance with Holcomb blitzing. But once he avoids that, there's nobody left to prevent him from getting to the sticks. Last game, the fullback. Herbert to tailback. And Herbert gets out of the backfield. Turns no gain into a minimal gain. 12 and a half to go it'll be second and four he has low center gravity he's very physical as a runner but some poor tackling there by the commanders he's just bouncing off of guys one, two, three and again he's a talented back but we've seen that now a handful of times we saw it on that big run that long run that he had Payne, Payne comes back into the game after missing a handful of plays and they're going to be a little short of the first down here. Herbert. And it will be third down coming up. Third and one for the Bears. Five runs. Nary a pass on this drive so far. They wanted a pass on one of them. It turned out to be a Fields run for a first down. Fields. Chased. Spins. cannot get away. Cannot get away. Montez Sweat chasing him down. So from third and one, they go to fourth and 14. Well, again, Sweat's been doing this all night to Jones, the rookie, but what's different is they took anywhere for him to go. It's one thing. He's been avoiding that initial rush, but there's other defenders that also get into that backfield leaving fields nowhere to take off. Trenton Gill caught at the 19-yard line. Dax Milne going all the way across the field. Has some room up to the 33-yard line, and that's where Washington will take over. It's Unis tonight, right? You asked me, is this kind of a Clemson look? Tennessee, Illinois, right? Syracuse? Yeah. Orange helmets, the first time the Bears have ever worn orange helmets. And the franchise is only 100 years old plus. This drive starts with Robinson going nowhere and slung down by Pennell. The leader of this defense has been very active, Roquan Smith. Gets the pass and the run. Does just a good job of just setting the tone and has great vision and instincts. You know, he is a linebacker that I think across this league, people know that every time the Bears play, number 58 plays with a certain attitude, quickness, the vision, the instincts, everything. Total package, and he's going to try to get the Bears to the finish line tonight. Second and 12. That is caught. Nice catch there. Snatching it out of the air was Cam Sims. Under 10 to play. It is very clear that Alan Williams has put this plan together to force Wentz to be patient and to check it down. Talking to him this week, he knew that he wanted to see if Wentz would be willing to do that. Take away the threat of McLaurin and Samuel and Brown downfield. He's going to do a good job of rooting in there and pushing, keep moving those feet. and then it's just hard physical running there by Robinson to get it across that goal line and eventually into the end zone. Trying for two here to make it a seven-point lead. A little more than halfway through the fourth. Wentz backpedaling and just fires that one out of the end zone and incomplete. So unsuccessful there, but Washington for the first time. 12-7. Here's the play right here. Jones inside the 10. Robinson then is able to get into the end zone. And the command... Gives the commanders the lead. And we'll see what the Bears can do right now. You've got Trusted Ebner, a rookie out of Baylor. And if it doesn't happen then, you just have the feeling it's happening eventually. Sooner or later. Yeah. From the 25-yard line, Fields comes out the back door and picks up five yards. Pushed out there by Wild Goose. And it's second down. Speaking of Wild Goose, see that Dodger game last night? A wild goose got out onto the field? Not this guy. No, no, but I didn't know what to think of that. I was shocked they continued to play. Get the goose out of here. We need to keep going. You took a game. Never mind. You obviously took a game. We've already made our debut at the Embassy Suites in Joliet in the lounge. Second down and five. Fields is going to keep it. Is that a busted play or what? Yeah. He looks like he's trying to get to the outside to follow some of these linemen. The right tackle, Larry Borum, is trying to get out there. But, you know, Ridgeway in the middle opens up Payne and Allen to get outside. They put him right at the nose. Really, it's freed them up. And they come right up to the line now, making sure that Washington defense can't change. Third down and five. Fields, and he gets sacked. So on another third down play, it was third and one the last time. He's slow on the rising again. Jonathan Allen is there. Needs some assistance to get back up on his feet. And that, with a flag thrown, would be the fourth sack for Washington. Defense, number 25. Five-yard penalty for the previous spot. Wow. Catch a break. Major. You know, Allen starts to lose his balance. That's the reason you see Fields getting up slow. It's because look where Allen hits him. Yeah. Down low. Kind of an awkward tackle to bring him down. Meanwhile, the penalty was on Benjamin St. Juice. So that gives them a first down at the 35-yard line. And the hand of all off here. Montgomery to the 41-yard line. He goes Holcomb. Makes the tackle with 540 and ticking down. Jenkins and Boreham again on that right side. Positive yards are available to the outside. Test the edge of this defense. The best blockers are the tight ends and the tackles on this offense. Second and four. Montgomery takes the toss Picks up the first down Takes a heavy hit there Holcomb Leading tackler by Amar for this team Makes the stop Again, get outside This time they go to the left behind Braxton Jones 70, little pen and pull Seal it here And then pull to the outside Where you can let these linemen Build up some momentum You get the tight ends out there as well Backs run hard for the Bears As you're in the fourth quarter, they've been rotating Herbert, Montgomery, keeping these guys fresh, much like what we've seen from the commanders. Montgomery on first down. Two-yard pickup, 49, four and a half to go in regulation. Let's see if they're able to get another first down, but you've got to go play action on first and ten. I mean, commanders at this point are just anticipating run. thinking, run, run, run.
