 Preference prevented Emerson from being able to stay with Pickens. That's why Martin was looking over to the Cleveland bench to see what Savancy wanted to do on the call. Right. They declined, so it's fourth down and five, and in comes the punt group. Chester Rogers is back. Presley Harvin. Presley Harvin III Sounds like an aristocrat Does the punting Had a good rookie season Second year out of Georgia Tech Trying to draw Cleveland offside If nothing else You're in a position here Even a 5 yard penalty is going to be Consequential you would think. Delay of game. Offense, number six. Five yard penalty. Fourth down. So the line of scrimmage becomes the 46 yard line. Harvin tonight has punted once for 39 yards. That's the slide to his right. To haul it in. Short kick. Fielded. Fair caught at the 14. Averaged over five yards per rush. 5-8 coming into the game tonight. And here he goes. And he's able to turn a loss into, if nothing else, a small game. Fewest carries to 5,000 rushing yards in NFL history. Michael Vick, of all people, 694. Jamal Charles, 896. And there's Chubb. Yards per carry. There it is. the league average is always around 4.2. Shows you how proficient he's been. Yeah, you know, and throughout his career, we've been talking about it all week. He's been relatively quiet, averaging about 4.4 against his Steeler defense in his career. 5.5 against every other defense that he's gone up against in the league. Five wide on the second and nine. To the outside. Good pass right there. Cooper. Tight ropes the sideline. Big game. I told you all week how much I really appreciate the more I've studied Brissette. The command, the accuracy, decision-making. He sees Cooper off to the right. Soft coverage. Quick little out. Anticipates the throw. Gets it to the outside and takes advantage of that matchup. Man, he is, again, after the first two drives, this offense has settled in. Really the only time they were stopped is when Cooper dropped that fourth down play right before the half. Absolutely. Brutley gain of 28. Browns at the 43. Little over eight minutes to go in the third. Off the fake. Substays in the block. Passes for here. Majoku. His big knife continues. Finally the screen game, which is as good as anybody's in the league. You know, the ball's getting out fast. Defansky's done a nice job of mixing up these looks. Running the ball. Getting the ball out. It's the screen, which they did so much of last week against the Jets. The timing of their screen game with Bill Callahan as a line coach. Boy, they time it up well. They really sell it. Makes the defense think the ball's going downfield. Makes it easy for those linemen to get out front. The Joko, eight targets, eight catches. For 81 yards. Through the middle. Shove. Inside the 40. and that's why he does Bill Parcells would say that's why he does all them squats perfect timing to show how committed he is in that weight room his lower half is as strong as anybody's I mean and he never the other thing is probably the most humble superstar in the NFL and he's just a grinder and let's not forget about this offensive line this is a veteran group got a face mask there that wasn't called last season 2 The crowd stall. Jack Conflict. Second and one. 186. Play action. Rolling. Black throne. And for the moment, a first time. But we'll see about that. We've got a hold there on the right side. Holding. Michael Dunn. Offense number 68. Ten yard turner lead. 3.2nd down. So it negates that game. The Browns won the toss. They've elected to receive. Normally teams defer, as you know. Jerome Ford is back to return it if he can. Chris Boswell, the kickoff. If there's a prevailing direction, it's the direction in which Boswell is kicking right now. And we wouldn't lie to you as it goes through the end zone. And they'll start out at the 25-yard line. Jacoby Prezett. And, of course, we will talk about the whole situation with the Cleveland quarterback situation a little bit later as we go along. But here he is, pretty much a placeholder, at least at the outset of the season, at least until December, when Deshaun Watson will be eligible to play. He's been around, started with New England, went to Indianapolis for four seasons. Last year, he backed up Tua in Miami. Chubb is the running back. He is second in the league in rushing after a couple of weeks with Shaquan Barkley of the Giants on top. Starting the ground. Figured to spend a lot of time on the ground. Tonight, gain of one. Kevin Stefanski starts his third season as the Cleveland head coach. Took him to the playoffs and won a playoff game. First time they did that since 1994 when they beat Pittsburgh two years ago. 20-15, his regular season mark, 1-1 in postseason. Done a nice job with Brissette the first couple weeks. He's been very efficient. They put him in very comfortable situations until late in the game last week against the Jets when he was trying to bring them back. Second down and 9. Give it to Chubb again. Big hole as he exploits. and then leaps at the 39-yard line. Taken down there. That's Minka Fitzpatrick. He jumped over first down. You know, you see the play side blocks, but the back side block is just as important. You've got to get double teams all up there. Duo blocks. What a great job there on the left side with Wills and Petonio, where they just seal off that back side and open it up. So great blocking on the play side, but to really hit a big one in this running game, you've got to do a nice job of sealing it on the back side as well. First time in the gun. Percet gets it away before he goes down, and it's incomplete. Steelers, in their first game of the season against Cincinnati, had seven sacks. Of course, they're minus T.J. Watt. Last week, no sacks. Well, that's the thing I think everybody is interested in seeing, especially if you're a Steelers fan, is without T.J. Watt, how does this team get home? Can they get pressure? We didn't see it last week, as you mentioned. And here early, he gets back in that gun, and they are able to apply that pressure. And there is T.J., torn pectoral muscle. You know, he could be back, they hope, in a couple of weeks. Didn't put him on IR. That's Hunt in motion. Pass is caught here by Amari Cooper. They picked him up in the offseason in a trade with the Cowboys, and Cam Sutton makes the tackle there. It'll be third down. You know, you just know the tradition of the Steelers, Mike Tomlin, and they get backed into a corner off of a loss, people start questioning them about decision-making. That's usually when they come out and play with a bit of an attitude and a chip on their shoulder. Without a huddle right now, Berset. Backing up, keeps his eyes downfield, fires, and deflected and incomplete and almost picked by Levi Wallace. So after one first down, off they go now, and in comes the punting group. You know, he's just a little bit late on this throw. You can also see to the middle here the rookie, David Bell, who is open. He's got him if he wants him. But look, if this ball's thrown now, it's a first down. But he waits just to be sure, and he allows a defender to be able to come over there and knock that away in Levi Wallace. Corey, the Horquez, who has been with Green Bay and before that Buffalo, to send it down toward Gunnar Olszewski. Booming kick And it winds up landing in the end zone So much for the prevailing win Which is really kind of a swirling win As it normally is in an enclosed stadium Harris, per usual, is the running back Bring Claypool inside Sadistri on a roll Keeping his eyes downfield It throws on the run, and along the sideline, that's Deontay Johnson, their top receiver, hauling it in. And this is where he's most comfortable. We just talked about let him get his feet under him. Play action, boot, get him to the outside, get the outside of the backer walker right there, and then he's able to get his shoulders turned and make a very accurate throw to Deontay Johnson. This is an offense, as you said, didn't. A midfield, and that may have been tipped. Looked like Miles Killebrew got a hand on it back in 30 seconds. He knew what he was doing. Absolutely. Drive starts from the 48-yard line. Harris exploits that hole and picks up nine, taken down inside the 40-yard line by Grant Delpit. Anthony Walker there as well, second down and one. That's what you like to see for Najee Harris, the chance to have a little bit of room to work. Mason Cole to center, Kevin Dotson at left guard, opening it up, letting 22 get downhill a little bit, build up some of that momentum. He's not had a lot of opportunities in the first two weeks to be able to show what he can do. Gave him a nice spot. Looked like he picked up in about nine and a half. They gave him the full ten, so it's a first down at the 38-yard line. Once again, a spin move to the 34-yard line. So Harris was drafted last year out of Alabama in the first round, 24th overall pick. They used him a ton. He's a three-down back, had over 300 carries and over 70 receptions last season. Yeah, he had to wait and pay his dues in college behind Josh Jacobs, Damian Harris. and then he comes as a rookie, and as you said, he's one of the older backs in the NFL. He needed a little bit of spot duty. That's why you're seeing now Jalen Warren as a rookie will help him out a little bit. To the outside they go here. Nothing happening. George Pickens, another rookie out of Georgia, picked in the second round. Had a great preseason, has caught one pass in each of the first two games. Catches this one here, but to no avail really. How about the rookie, Emerson, out of Mississippi State, recognizing this right away and is able to get the other rookie out of Georgia, Pickens. So this defense has a lot of speed. They fly to the football. Go no huddle here. Trubisky in the empty backfield. Blitzes on. Trubisky throws, and it's caught at the 35-yard line, but the Browns are right there to stop Najee Harris. Pressure put on that side by Anthony Walker. So now it is fourth down, and the Steelers are going to send Boswell one of the best ever. When you look at the statistics through the years, third all-time in field goal percentage. But it's about the win. That's all about the win. Again, the prevailing win looked as if in pregame it was in this direction. Depending on the time, right? It's swirling down there. Still the end of summer. Fall doesn't start for another few minutes. 50-yard attempt to try to get Pittsburgh to lead. And Boswell, no good. Started out good, faded like a screwball to the right. Truly, that's the way the wind is really pushing, to the right of the kicker. That was headed right towards the middle, but that wind pushed it to the right. Cleveland gets it at its own 40. He's in the foreground. Gets it really clean. I mean, it's right down the middle. It gives you an idea how strong these winds are tonight. And he just said, oh, boy. You know what? Kickers might want to start aiming to the left. I mean, in his case. Like you. But the wind, it swirls. I'll slice under any conditions. Well, the wind right now, it's gusting. It'll dust up to 25 miles an hour. The temperature is 60 degrees on this final day of summer. With autumn coming our way at 9.04 in a few minutes. Cleveland starting from the 40-yard line. Chubb bangs his way for a game of two. Cam Hayward right there. Another stellar season for him. 12th year in the league. Boy, he's so strong. Able to work down the line. And they try to use a double team. Again, this is a matchup we want to see all game long with Antonio. Go no huddle here in the pass to the outside. Chubb can't hold in. And very quickly gets third down to nine. It seems like Cleveland early in this game. Last week, what a great job of staying ahead of schedule. Third and two, third and three. They're very efficient here against this defense. It's been a different story. And again, the Pittsburgh defense minus the big star, T.J. Watt, who is out here working out, jogging before the game. Kareem Hunt is the back right now. He sets up in the slot to the left on the third down and nine. It started out as a slot. We may have a shootout. And what a different offense. Ben Roethlisberger retires. Trubisky's here. much more mobility from that spot. Since that one, about three yards into the end zone, and Jerome Ford will run this one back to the 12-yard line. And we go to Kaylee. Al, part of Watson's settlement requires that he receive treatment for his behavior, and that's ongoing. And the most vital condition to his reinstatement is that his clinician, who was approved by the league and players' union, has final determination as to whether Watson faithfully and fully participated in this treatment plan. If that happens, the settlement calls for reinstatement in accordance with the timeline defined in his suspension, and it's stipulated that he must only use team massage therapists for the remainder of his career. Kaylee, if $230 million guaranteed doesn't motivate you to do the things you need to do, I give up. Balls at the 12-yard line. Over the middle, that's caught. You know, also, Kirk, every team wants a franchise quarterback. These guys, they had Johnny Manziel. That didn't work out. They drafted Baker Mayfield pretty good for a while. He's in Carolina right now. He's watching the guy. If he's not, maybe they'll just exhum Otto Graham. On second and four, that is caught. Big night for Njoku, and he bangs his way out to the 37-yard line. Again, right now you're seeing Preset in a zone these last few drives. Talked about the open and what I like about him being complimentary to what they like to do running the football. But here in obvious passing situations, they're clearly trying to move the ball in up-tempo. See how calm he is, working through his progressions, finding the open man. Both teams going up-tempo tonight. And again, the tight end, Najoku, makes another catch. seven catches I apologize, he's just right now he's attacking the interior, he's finding those linebackers who are not able to match up finding the soft spot in the zone and Joku's you know, outside of Amari Cooper is a go-to target for him seven catches, ties and Joku's career high as Nick Chubb takes the ball into Steeler territory as we tick down to the two minute warning Heck the start to this drive. Reset just in command. Let the clock work down here. Well, maybe not. Come up to the line. 2-0-1, two minutes. And here's the stoppage. At the scarf on tonight. Temperature right now is 59. Looking sharp down there. Second and seven from the 50. 180, set! Here's Chubb. Excuse me, Hunt. It's Hunt to the 39-yard line. Kareem Hunt. 1-1-A is the way to put it. No doubt. It should be. Posick to center. Great job. Wyatt Teller. This offensive line is really coming together here. Playing great football. You can see the push that they get. 55-77. And there's the vision. Put his foot in the ground, got vertical, and picked up the first down. I'm wanting to trade in the offseason. Team said, nope. No way. From the 39-yard line. Here he goes again, but this time goes nowhere. Broken up by Malik Reed. Came over from Denver as a free agent. Second down. Reed is the one everybody wants to see step up with T.J. Watt. You know, they use a lot of different guys with Watt down, and that time 50 did a great job of fighting off of that block to be able to make that play. Under a minute. Second and ten. To the outside. Swing at the hunt. Nice tackle is there. Former Jaguar Miles Jack stops him. The clock is stopped with 50 seconds. You know, the beginning of this drive, they had a little bit more urgency. You know, I thought they were thinking about attacking and trying to get six on the board. Remember with the wind, we're seeing extra points that are in question. So keep that in mind as they're continuing to get the first down. And then you're thinking about trying to maybe take a shot or two, trying to get six points. Timeout taken here by Pittsburgh. And we're back in 30 seconds. Good line. He said 15 of 20, 75% in the first place in the AFC North with a record 2-1. You know, both of them coming off the losses that they had, the energy that they had, short week. You want to get back on track, right? So they are playing for stuff tonight. Well, that's knocked down at the 15-yard line. And that's David Bell who will bring it back out to the 21. Meanwhile, let's go back to that catch at the Meadowlands back in 2014. Flag on the play, one-handed, and that was Beckham as a rookie. Wow. Yeah. You know, generation of receivers after that, they were in high school, middle school, they practiced that all the time. We had Beckham in the Super Bowl last year, of course, playing with the Rams, and I asked him in our meeting, I said, was that a blessing or a curse? He said it was both because it put him in such a limelight that he had to work his way through that. Ball at the 21-yard line. That's fired and caught. Gain of seven. Amari Cooper, hey, as an Ohioan, do you know what this rivalry means? And they've been meeting since 1950. Well, it's nasty. I mean, you go back to the old AFC Central days, and it was a different kind of vibe, and now you have the AFC North, and it's still about the fans, the passion, the emotion every time these teams get together. The Steelers obviously had the upper hand. Second and three, down the sideline, making the cashes. Cooper staying inbounds, but they're going to say he stepped out now. He stepped out is what they're going to call it for the moment, taking it to the 15-yard line. Boy, oh boy. Witherspoon better keep his eye on Amari Cooper. They may catch a break with Amari Cooper stepping out of bounds. A big break. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Illegal touching. Offense number two. Witherspoon out of bounds on his own and his first to touch the ball. So lost a down at the previous spot. Third down. Witherspoon lost Cooper. His eyes were in the backfield. And speaking of getting lost, Cooper must have just gotten lost on where he was on the field and just steps out of bounds. No one came close to touching him. Took three and a half steps out of bounds, too. That's the one guy of all these receivers you can't lose sight of. So back we go to the 27-yard line. It'll be third down and four. And a stoppage. Game clock operator, please set the game clock to 14-14. 14-14, please. Seven seconds come off the clock. Mike Tomlin in his 16th season. Never had a losing season in all of those years taking over for Bill Cowher back in the 07 campaign Clock in order and back we go on the third and three At 86. Hangs in there. Fires caught. That's a first down. David Njoku makes his second grab of the night. First down. He goes Louie Louie with the call to move that line. He feels pressure over here. So he moves that line to the left to help him. And he knows he still wants to get the ball out quickly. Does a good job there of finding Joku there for, again, positive yards on first and ten. Dave Brissett has commanded this offense of Stefanski's. Confident guy. He is. Been through a lot. First down from the 40. They got a timeout taken by the Steelers. Pittsburgh, their first. 30-second timeout. Brissett in the seventh year. The yards per pass low, 6.4. But the passes per interception every 71. So both second lowest among active players. A lot of it he plays more safely than a lot of quarterbacks do. Yeah, I think he's cautious. And I think a lot of it has to do with what he's been through. You know, he was in Indy when Luck was there. Luck was injured one year. He had a bunch of starts. Luck retired, had a bunch of starts. He had some highs and some lows, a lot of lows. And I think because of some of those experiences, he wants to be sure. So he is conservative. But I'll tell you, in this offense, especially last week, he's a... Give it to him. To the right side. And he goes, turns the corner. And the ball is out. And inbounds. And who's got it? It's like Deontay Johnson got on top of that. The rookie's running hard, but he doesn't take care of the football. And he's lucky that Johnson is there to pick it up. Not John Johnson, who knocked it loose. But Deontay Johnson, 18. He was there blocking and then just was able to look down and locate the football. So the run is good for 17 yards. Warren is carried four times for 37 yards. Harris seven times for 31. 1. Team Hayward and the gang on the south. Meanwhile, Myles Garrett, fairly quiet night for him to this point. To Devian Clowney, who would be on the other side normally, not active tonight with an ankle injury. And Harris can go nowhere. 1.22 is taken down by another. They are getting those safeties down against this running game. especially on early downs. That's where that play-action boot is so effective. You see these safeties starting to cheat. Delpit. They're putting eight, sometimes nine on those early downs. And I think you'll see some adjustments made by Matt Canada go a little bit more to those play-action, early down play-action to be able to get him and move that launch point, create a one-on-one matchup on the outside. Second and nine. Haven't gone to the side-end frying booth yet. Handed off to Claypool. Coming around from the outside. And able to thread his way for a first out. And that's a staple of Matt Canada's offense. Sometimes he uses it as eye candy, as a distraction. Other times he'll give it. Usually it's a smaller receiver that's quick. He's elected to use Claypool in a lot of these jet sweeps because of his speed and his size to break tackles. Using the fast-paced offense. To great advantage tonight as Harris picks up 11 yards and gets to the 4. Well, this looks like a different offensive line from last week to this week. James Daniels with a big-time block that time, just pushing Bryan out of that hole and opening it up. Again, no huddle. First and goal from the 5. Harris. Just inside the 2-yard line with 4.5 to go to the half. this offensive line last week. You know, it's a lot of new faces. Mason Cole, James Daniels have come in. You know, they're trying to still build continuity for Mike Tomlin and Matt Canada. And, you know, tonight we're seeing a little bit of a different attitude. Watch the right guard, Daniels, just kind of putting that defensive tackle right on his back. Mason Cole up to the linebacker. Much more communication and everybody on the same page. Daniels coming over from Chicago. Played there with Trubisky. Second down and goal. Mitch takes it himself dives in for the score so Mitch Trubisky able to get it in they go 10 plays 75 yards in 5-0-8 is he in or not is the question he looks up at the board ruled a touchdown initially but the knee is down there and the ball doesn't appear. The left knee stayed up, Al. The right knee obviously hits. Watch that left knee. It grazes it. It's close. It grazes it. Another look from the pylon. Does he get in? That was a second down play. Terry McCauley, you're looking at what we're looking. What do you see? I am out, and it appears to me the ball is just breaking the plane when that knee touches. It's really tight. They rule touchdown on the field. I think it's going to stand if it goes to review. All scoring plays are looked at. So it's either a touchdown with the extra point to come. I don't see that left knee touching. The right is there. If it's the right knee that's down first, it's a touchdown. Meanwhile, they've ruled it a touchdown. So now Boswell for the extra point to give them the lead, which he does. 129 yards. Good protection. That's caught, but short of the first down. David Bell makes the grab. Ken Sutton makes the tackle. Clock rolls, and it's going to be fourth down and a short two. And Sutton trying to stay with the rookie, David Bell, out of Purdue on that crosser. They're going to call a timeout and talk about this. Interesting choice with the win the way it is. Very. Got him lined up clear to the outside. He's going to work across. They're just trying to make Sutton have to work through some traffic. He does a good job of getting separation, but Sutton doesn't give up on the play. He's able to keep him short of that first down. Steelers are going to get the ball to start the second half. Cleveland won the toss, and they elected to receive at the outset. So now it's fourth down and two to keep the offense out on the field. With the way Brissette right now is throwing, I mean, conventional wisdom says, Chubb, you run the ball, but Percette, man, he's in a zone with his decision-making and finding matchups to his advantage. He may be a placeholder, but not in his mind. No. Hunt comes into the slot. Percette looks the other way. Now over the middle. Throws. Caught! Enough for the first down. Cooper makes the catch. Well, that was a zone. What an effort by Cooper to get around Kareem Hunt. And, you know, then I thought he might settle down, but he continued across. Made it tougher on Brissette, who had to have kind of a jump pass, get it over the defender and get it to him. I thought he might settle right here. It's not man-to-man. Instead, he continues on, and it made Brissette, like I said, have to go up in the air and make that throw right there over the linebacker. Needed to. Got it. Timeout taken by Cleveland. They have one left. Another review is going to be looked at right now to make sure he caught it under review. It was ruled a catch. We think they're going to overturn it here It pretty clear Been looking at the replay that the ball came out So 27 They may may put a couple of more seconds back on the clock Here Martin The pass was incomplete It'll be first to the chance. Pitchman. Cleveland will not recharge their timeout at the end of the play. Please set the game clock to 30 seconds. 3-0 on the game clock, please. They put three seconds on the clock. Yeah, yeah. But, again, if Cooper settles in that zone and doesn't continue on, it's a much easier play. But instead, the throw is a tough throw to make. Good effort by Cooper. But usually the sure-handed Cooper is able to secure that for the first down. But the ball just gets away from him right at the end, and it hits the ground. So now the Steelers, yeah, Tomlin knows. He do. 30 seconds. They have one timeout, and they will get the ball. Let's start the second half. empty the backfield on first down Trubisky 8 out of 9 ton of time protection is great before it starts to break down the flag in the secondary Denzel Ward. Before the pass was thrown. Holding. Defense number 21. Five yard killing. Automatic first down. That's Denzel Ward taking Johnson down. That right hand. That's what Denzel Ward is known for. This is man-to-man skills. You can't put your hand on the receiver downfield. Takes the ball out to the 37 now. That took five seconds off the clock. 25 seconds to halftime. Four-man rush. Trubisky buys time. Fires caught at the 43-yard line. Taken down there, inbounds. And the clock will be stopped on their final timeout. Claypool making the grab. Yeah, now Trubisky is so comfortable. Rolling to the outside. Cover two. You have two safeties that are back here and back here. It opens up the middle. And then eventually Claypool is working all the way back here. You see that opening in that zone. Great job of just waiting, waiting. He knows he's going in there. It's a great throw, right? Hank and Dunk, I love it, our meeting this morning. Small ball, what you called it, a baseball reference. They've got to take some shots downfield tonight to stretch this defense. Exactly what it's been through two games. Only two offensive touchdowns. One in each contest. Harris taking down at the 35-yard line. in his second year. Meanwhile, Trubisky started with Chicago last year in Buffalo, backing up Josh Allen. Two touchdowns, one interception, and a very low rating. The rating is always normally league-wide in the 90s. Last week was a rough outing for him. Had happy feet, was getting out of the pocket a little bit early, just never really found his rhythm. Second and eight. Harris again Picks up about three Up to the 37 yard line Jordan Elliott number 96 Stops from there It'll be third down and five for the Steelers You're the Browns You're attacking the line of scrimmage on early downs You get beat on a boot So be it Your corners are going to have to hold up one on one But you want to make Trubisky after last week Beat you from the pocket Throwing the football Joe Woods calling in the defense He's come under fire this week after the meltdown last week. Trubisky will go deep downfield, and it's broken up. Again, he goes for Deontay Johnson, and Denzel Ward is able to break up the play fourth down. You know, I think if you're a Steelers fan, even though it's incomplete, you're just saying, hey, they threw it downfield. It's nice to see them take a shot one-on-one against Denzel Ward, who's been questioned and talked about a lot because of the last couple weeks. There's Garrett, third down, you've got to keep him out. Good job to give Trubisky enough time, but the one-on-one shot there on third down ends up falling to the ground. Presley Harvin to send it down toward the just-activated Chester Rogers. Calls for, makes the fair catch. At the 23-yard line. Involved there. Those were next-gen stats powered by AWS. So from the 23-yard line, give it to Chubb. A lot of people thought Chubb should have fallen down and not scored the touchdown. I mean, still, even though he went in, they missed the extra point. You have a 13-point lead. That was what you call a smorgasbord of failure lessons. Yeah, and I mean, all the years that you've been covering games, do you ever see a finish like that? I mean, I've never seen a team quite give it up like that. Not since the Browns about 20 years prior against, I think it was the Bears. Okay. Yep, close. Second down and eight. It was like the football gods said, this is not happening today for you. You can't go to 2-0. That's caught by Kareem Hunt, and he gets tackled immediately. Up at the 27-yard line by Miles Jack, the former Jacksonville Jaguar. Nice to see how they get both Chubb and Hunt in together. You know, you look at Kareem Hunt and what he brings to the table here. I mean, he'd be starting at most backfields in the NFL, and you get them on the field together. Both of them can catch the ball, so it really puts a lot of pressure on the defense to know where that football might be going. The same Kareem Hunt who, with Kansas City as a rookie, led the league in rushing. Four receivers set to the left. Steelers almost jumped in the due. Got him to jump offside. So third and six, that's Alex Highsmith with three sacks on opening day. defense in the 56th on the third down Martin makes it official that's going to make it third down and one now you and I were talking at the break it kind of has a feeling of that kind of game right a little play like this you go from third and long to now third and much more manageable obviously third and one you can run the football with Chubb you can pick up a first down so remember that see if they're able to take advantage of it feels like a field position field position special teams penalties who makes an error on stage in the backfield. Third down and one. Percet under pressure. Gets sacked. So that is Ogunjobi, Larry Ogunjobi, who comes in. He's the first guy in there. And it's fourth down. With that pressure from Highsmith, they slide to the left. They're going to move this way, and it frees up a nice gap there for Ogunjobi to be able to slide through there. A little miscommunication there with the right guard, Wyatt Teller, not able to come down hard enough to help Posick out. They were sliding because of that blitz, and third and one, they throw the football, and it backfires. So, Borges with his second punt, his first was 61 yards gross, went into the end zone. And this one much shorter, and it bounds out of bounds around. Alabama, I said, you know, I think he looks in the mirror and sees 190 pounds back, and I said, Wait till you guys see Warren, who is about 190, 200 pounds. He sees a 230-pound back. So very different running styles between these guys and different body styles. Opening drive of the second half. Lost a four on the play. Second down and 14. Bring Warren back in. Put him in the slot. A little shovel pass to him. Great-looking play. And there goes the undrafted rookie, but a flag is down back at the 46-yard line. And one of the Browns is down as well. At the 45, it's Anthony Walker with his helmet off. Anyway, you saw a flag come in as the play was developing, and they work on Walker right now. Hmm. All right. Time out for the injury. Well, a site you never want to see, obviously. The cart comes out. Walker is still down. Took a shot to the face and then was pounced upon. Here's the replay. Yeah, you see contact there. and then after he hits him, jumps on top of him. And I think that's where the flag came in. Okorafor, the right tackle. Pretty violent hit there before he jumped on top. Walker's such an integral part of that defense. Preset's out there making sure he's okay. Walker, the leader of that front. the penalty is going to be for the ineligible man downfield. We'll get that call. Martin hasn't made that yet. Terry, what did you see on that replay? Well, we were talking to New York, Al, and they've told us it is a foul for an ineligible downfield. I really don't know why we haven't heard an announcement from the referee yet. Originally, we did think it might have been a personal foul, unnecessary roughness when he piled on top of the player on the ground, but it's not. We're told it's an ineligible downfield. Here's the call. And those are the players downfield on a forward pass. Offense number 76. Five-yard penalty. So that's the core of four. And it negates what would have been a huge game deep into Cleveland territory. Saw him having the brace on that left leg as he was put on the card. So now both the linebackers are down. so there's Olsu Coramon he's out Walker's out so it's a couple of backups in there right now for Cleveland on a second down and 19 and Trubisky to the outside throws and that's caught picks up a lot of yards there setting up a third and short it's Deontay Johnson making the catch his sixth of the game again man to man coverage Remember Ward's had some issues in recent weeks in zone. He's one-on-one. Eyes in the backfield trying to read the quarterback. Good route by Deontay Johnson coming back to the ball. Ward didn't look quite sure of what the coverage was again. Seemed looking back inside to the defense. Happened much too much of the secondary. Third and five. Warren is the back. The pass is deflected and incomplete. And a flag throw. The rookie may have got caught up and tangled there. Martin Emerson, 23. It was a third and five. Clay Martin again. Eventually. That's on Claypool. Claypool and Emerson collide. 23 to the right. Once he works to the outside. that's the that's where he going offensive passive and we'll make a second down and let's pull it to 11 yeah they go unbalanced to the right there bring in Dunn and you see the push he's just trying to withstand that that linebacker blitz by Spillane and one thing he could really do is lock up on him on the outside and prevent him from getting in there and obviously holds 180 180 180 Chubb cuts it back man he's good this Chubb said he's good that's all you need to say how about Jack Conklin being back had the injury last year does a good job at blocking on the back side there's that jump cut but it's the vision and the patience That play is designed to go left. It could bounce to the outside or it could cut it all the way back. Stays on the tracks and eventually works back to the backside and follows the right tackle's block cut behind Jack Conklin. Maybe he can see Conklin back after knee surgery. Jump averaging seven yards per carry tonight. Third and three. Hunt. come up a little short just shy of the 35-yard line. There's no way he doesn't go for this. They've got a little bit of momentum here. They've got backs. They've got a big line. We saw the quarterback, Brissette, earlier with a good push. You mentioned how he's one of the best in the league when it comes to quarterback sneaks. Sure. In that situation right now, he's 29 out of 30 is Brissette on third and one or fourth and one. Chubb in the backfield. Give it to Hunt. They put one and one A ball in the backfield. Chubb goes to the outside. Hunt goes through the middle first out. And they motioned him late. So everybody's thinking sneak or he's going to give it to Chubb. But by motioning him in there late, they're able to really surprise this Pittsburgh defense. Left tackle, Jedrick Willis is hurt. He's down on the turf. He comes in late. By the time this defense, they're pinching. They're thinking quarterback sneak. After all the stats you mentioned, of course they're thinking that the big man's going to keep it. Instead, they give it to a fullback, even though he's a tailback, after they motion him into the backfield. First down, but the left tackle. Wills is down on the grass. And often going into the medical tent, and here is what happened. He just gets rolled up on. See a good push there by his own player, and he rolls up Cam Hayward right on him. But a lot of times you hold your breath and nose, but he did walk off. So now from the 27 with 420 Remaining in the third in a one-point game The Steelers on top To the 24, let's go to Kaylee Well, not long after we saw linebacker Anthony Walker Carden off the field clearly in pain The team's confirmed he is out for the game They've x-rayed his knee and they're looking into it Also, his fellow linebacker, Jeremiah Okafor-Koromoa He's questionable to return with a quad injury and defensive tackle. Taven Bryan is questionable with a hamstring injury. Thank you, Kaylee. Three guys on defense as they empty the backfield here on second down and seven. Pass is caught a little short of the first down at the 19-yard line by Amari Cooper. One of four Pro Bowl wide receivers who got traded in the offseason. Dallas sending him to Cleveland. come up no huddle here third and one and the set will take it himself and there he goes does it again update the stats yeah 30 out of 31 second time he's done that tonight I think it was what Pittsburgh was expecting on the fourth and one good surge up front and this is one of the better offensive lines especially tandem of guards in the NFL so they're going to get a good push and the big man gets right behind it As they move into the red zone yet again. Gone 70 yards and 10 plays. This drive, six and a half minutes old. Stepping up. Throwing. And incomplete. Had it and dropped it. Najoku is there and Cam Sutton with the coverage on the play. Sutton does a really good jump Set in the pocket Fires Caught And close to a first down Najoku The tight end David looks over toward the sticks Does he get it? They have to get to the 50 yard line Spot it just a little bit shy Tackle made by Levi Wallace That is great separation By the big tight end against the corner They line up to go for it at the 50-yard line and fourth down in inches, and Brissette will keep it himself and take it for a first down. And when you have a big quarterback like that, you love the tempo. You knew that it came up short. Stefanski didn't even hesitate at all. Right away, use your big quarterback, let him lower his head, and pick up that first down. Stefanski probably aware that percent is that 29 of 30 on third and one and fourth and one that's the best percentage among the quarterbacks in the league right now he's that big body not intimidated at all does a nice job of just finding the trees Put your height! 1, 2, 1, 8, 6! Inside. Hand on. Chubb keeps his balance. Inside the 30. Cuts it back. Beautiful run. All the way to the 13-yard line. Betonio leading the way. Yeah, but it starts with the seal. It's a pin and pull. You've got to seal the edge. Watch everybody, receivers included. And then you have the left guard, Betonio, who's one of the best in the NFL, pulling around to lead the way for Chubb. Great blocks by the receivers, and it is tough ask on these defensive backs, anybody to come up and try to bring down Chubb. Broke away from Minka Fitzpatrick for 37 yards. Stays in the backfield here, gets it again, slips to the outside, picks up a couple. Witherspoon making the tackle there, second down, let's go at nine. Stefanski told us in our meeting yesterday, he said he's somewhat perplexed that they've not been able to run the football any better against his Steelers defense. They watch film, get ready to play the Steelers, and their schemes have not worked. They felt that they were going to make some adjustments, go to more of a gap scheme where it helps the offensive linemen get better blocking angles, and then you can bounce Chubb to the outside where he's one-on-one with a defensive back. That's exactly what happened there. Hunt now in the backfield. Chubb and Hunt, 1-1A. Fireball in the middle, caught, touchdown! Amari Cooper takes it to the end zone. So the Browns go for it on fourth down. Preset gets the first down, the big run by Chubb, and then Preset to Cooper, Cleveland on top. What a mismatch. Look at the cushion between Cooper, one of the best receivers, and a safety in Edmonds. It's one-on-one. He just has no chance giving that kind of cushion. An easy slant move. And you can see Brissette anticipated that. Nice throw and a touchdown for the Browns. Cade York, the only kicker selected in the draft. Big hero on opening day. Missed an extra point though last week. Bangs this one through. Nothing is automatic tonight. Browns take the early lead with 2-0-2 remaining in the opening quarter. 7-0. Cleveland. I'm told here they may not be the best indicator. Former Browns kicker Phil Dawson didn't think so. You see that small orange flag just below the American flag? Dawson had it installed in the visiting side left corner of the stadium because he said that's where he could gauge the most accurate wind direction. That's where he would look before kicks, guys. Daily, it's wind shear. I've been in too many stadiums in my life. It's wind shear is what it is. You would know. You've been in a few of these days. I would hope. Yeah. Start with a touchback here. Trubisky knows about playing in the wind because he grew up and played at Mentor High School in nearby Mentor, Ohio. He was Mr. Football in 2012. 42 touchdown passes and 18 rushing touchdowns. And then, of course, was the number two overall pick in the 17th draft by the Chicago Bears. And his first high school touchdown pass right here in this stadium. And it's funny. He said, you a big Browns fan growing up? And he said, no, I was a mentor Cardinals fan, high school football fan growing up. From the 25, they start with Jalen Warren, a rookie out of Oklahoma State, undrafted free agent. Harris gets a rest for the moment. Catch is made, and the rookie takes it up to the 28. You saw him in college. Yeah, you're going to love this guy. Yeah, you add Oklahoma State to them, and they got a real shot here. They've got 17 seconds. You've got a great field goal kicker in Boswell. You know, they've opened up the playbook, obviously, doing more things tonight than they did in the first two games. But I think the biggest thing has been the pace, quick pace. Yeah, they've changed up the tempo. They've been able to run the ball. The offensive line, let's face it, the offensive line's done a much better job tonight. And I think Matt Canada is in sync tonight with his quarterback as well. No question. Oh! Trubisky again has time. Fires. And out of bounds that time. Claypool, the nearest intended receiver. Now you've got 12 seconds. Well, he had Deontay Johnson. And Deontay Johnson, after the throw, was frustrated. It was like Johnson read one coverage. and Trubisky read another. You can see the frustration there. It's been a couple tough weeks for these receivers when they felt that they've been open and they want the ball. It's the first time we've seen some angst there on the outside. Yeah, Johnson very frustrated last week on a couple of occasions. Second and ten. No timeouts. Go, go, go, go, go. Deep drop. Steps up. Fires. Nothing there. Pickens the intended receiver. Covered well. Now you've got only six sticks. Good coverage downfield. They played man with the corners. Had two safeties to support behind. Martin Emerson, 23, who, by the way, is doing a really good job in his first three games for this Browns defense, right where he needed to be in man coverage. indoors you might try a 61 yard field goal but not outside in Cleveland tonight so barring a defensive foul it figures to be the final play of the half and now Cleveland back in your day many moves ago many harvest moves ago and Passamont moves third and ten Swabiski rolling and throwing and that'll do it. Incomplete and the end of the half. Difference, a missed extra point. 14-13, Pittsburgh leads it to the break. Mercedes-Benz, halftime show of the gang coming up after the break. Catch. Rookie second round pick. Brissette, meanwhile, two TV passes tonight. Looking sharp. The Steelers 34-1-1 in the most recent 36 games against this opponent. Brown started slowly. Last three drives have been great. Of course, Ben Roethlisberger was 25-2 with one tie against Cleveland. Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit. Kaylee Hartung. First Energy Stadium in Cleveland. Beginning week three. Steelers will get it. Olszewski is back. Gabe York to send it down to the end zone, and it will be run back from a yard in. Olszewski looking for room to the outside. It's bottled up at the 17-yard line moments ago. Kaylee spoke with Kevin Stefanski. Coach, after two weeks of miscommunications, how do you feel your defense has responded? I thought it was pretty good. Obviously, there's things to clean up. okay. That's a good attack that we're facing. So we've just got to make a couple plays on the ball. We were really trying to take this thing away. It was on the ground once there, but we've got to come up with it. And what does your offense need to do to separate itself in the second half? Yeah, just finish. We didn't start fast, but I think we've gotten a good feel for what they're trying to do to us. And I think we've got a good play and we've just got to go finish. All right. Thank you, Kaylee. Start with Trubisky in the pistol for the first time tonight. to the outside of Johnson. Meanwhile, Miles, we talked about him tonight. We've not called his name much at all, if at all. And they've done a nice job. You know, a lot of these are rollouts, and you're just getting away from them. Good double teams when they do throw from the pocket. But, you know, he told us yesterday how much pride he takes in defending the run. He just has not had many opportunities tonight to make a play, and really good plans so far for him in the first half. So the number one overall pick in the 17 draft facing Trubisky, the number two overall pick by the Bears who traded up to get him. Second and nine on the run. The pass is incomplete. You know, we saw Stefanski before. So Mike Tomlin is only the third Pittsburgh coach. You had Chuck Knoll, you had Bill Cowher in 53 years. A great compliment to what they want to do in this run game with this powerful offensive line and Nick Chug. Nick Chug. Hunt is now the running back on first down from the 40-yard line. To the outside he goes. Can't turn the corner. You know, Percet was originally drafted by New England back in 16. They had Brady, of course, there. They had Garoppolo there. So he comes in as a third-round draft choice. He was shocked that he was taken, and he winds up with Brady getting suspended at the beginning of the year, And Garoppolo getting hurt winds up playing a couple of games for New England. He's 1-1. And again, think of that. As far as your career, you go there, you have a chance to be around Bill Belichick, Tom Brady for a year. Then you go to Indy with Andrew Luck. Phillip Rivers comes in. He's down at Miami last year with Tua. Some great experiences for him. That's knocked away at the line of scrimmage. Batted down there. It'll be third down and nine. They're trying to get the ball out as quickly as they can. and Montrevious Adams unable to get there, so instead he just gets his hand up, 57. Nice job of getting the right hand up, times it perfectly, and just bats that down to get the Browns back to third down and long again. Hunt in the backfield. Again, four receivers set to the right. Brissett looks that way, fires that way, caught. And that's Donovan Peoples-Jones making his first catch and enough for a first down. Even when Amari Cooper doesn't catch the ball, he gets the defense's attention and it gives the other receivers an opportunity. Cooper's to the inside, to our right of Peoples-Jones. Defense is aware of where he is. You can see both of them. You saw Sutton 20 even had his eyes to the inside. And that's why Brissette recognizes that, gets the ball to the outside to Donovan Peoples-Jones. Jump back in. Here's Hunt to Peoples-Jones and back to Brissette. A lot of razzle-dazzle. And Hunt, with a hurdle move, might have picked up the first down. A lot of stuff going on. Leaping over Witherspoon along the way. Watch the veteran offensive line try to sell this to the right. Just like, no, don't mind us. We're just going to collectively hang out over here. Now, don't pay attention to us. Ball's not coming this way. Yes, it is. And then they take off and hunt just enough for that first down. So Stefanski goes to the back of the playbook, and it works here. Chubb is the back. Fake to him. He's set with time. Fires to the outside, and that is Amari Cooper along the sideline. making the grab. Another first down. Witherspoon covering on the play. Big cushion. Respect for Maury Cooper. There's the timing and the efficiency from Brissette. You give him a chance to put his foot in the ground. One hitch. Get the ball out. He's going to dial up Cooper every time. Nobody's challenging him right now. They respect him and even gets Witherspoon to turn there at the top of the route giving him that much more room. Gets the left foot down. Nice catch. Cooper's already caught four. Been targeted five times. Chubb has to back up. Come back the other way. Turns nothing into a little something. Adams hoping to break up the play. Second down. How about Adams? We saw him bat the ball down, and this time against Post at 57. Right in the middle. You can just see him blow that play up right from where it goes. That's one way to stop Nick Chubb. Just throw the center into the backfield, into his lap. There is T.J. Watt. Torn pectoral muscle. Oh. Again, hope to have him back. They do. Maybe in a couple of weeks. Yeah. So, three game. Kaylee talked about that. Second and nine. It's caught. Again, they go to the tight end. Njoku. David Njoku making his third grab of the half. puts him in a really good situation down in the red zone third and short Carol Austin the Steelers defensive coordinator saying his alignment on a third down and three another good-looking drive by the Browns Hunt Inside the 10 it be first down And Stefanski meanwhile the Browns in that period of time have had 21 head coaches while the Steelers have had 3 I knew it was a lot. I couldn't believe when you dropped that. Of course, you dropped it in the meeting. To both guys. Both guys. Coach Tomlin really got a kick out of that, didn't he? Oh, he did, of course. Easy for him to say 16 years, right? And a Super Bowl win back in 08 Stefanski in his third year, led him to that playoff win in 94 Warren is the back he stays in the block. Chubisky is able to Find his way Free the Browns say no catch the officials say a catch. Yes Claypool is there great John Johnson covering on the play Good job of making a play, but this is a case where he has a tendency to want to get out when he doesn't need to. Look at this pocket. I mean, that's a great pocket. He gets out, and he relies on the athletic ability to make the play, but he didn't need to make it that tough. Incomplete. Little Warren throwing the block that time on Anthony Walker to give Trubisky some time. He's a physical running back, even though he is undersized. Again, out of Oklahoma State. That was really what he was known for. Looks like we've got a flag, a late flag here. Clay Martin, who looks like to be a referee out of Central Casting, doesn't he? Oh, my gosh. Perfect form. Great uni. Couldn't be any better. Terry was like that back in his day. Very much so. Very tight, you know. Snug. 12 in on the field on the defense. 5-yard clearly. It's first and 5. Okay. Terry only ripped three Super Bowls. Exactly. But he looked good doing it. He did. Joe Woods calling the defensive alignment. A guy who, along with a few other people, came under a lot of fire here last week for that meltdown against the Jets. Talking to him this week. Grew up in Pittsburgh. Huge Steelers fan. Very good friend with Mike Tomlin. Hey, 5-5-5! 5-5-5! First and five after the penalty. White 20! Over left guard. Setting up the second and one. Najee Harris. Meanwhile, Jeremiah Owusu-Kuromoa got hurt. Here it is. Take a look at him coming off the field here after this play. He is a playmaker for this defense. Second and one now. A lot of traffic there, but threading his way for a first down is Najee Harris. who's now carried the ball a dozen times tonight for 52 yards. We'll see what happens on this drive, but the Browns have helped the Steelers here. They allowed that conversion on third long, 12 men on the field. So coming out here to start this second half, that's the key to the game. We've seen the Browns play good football and then have some miscues and some letdowns in the second half. Hey, Mike Stissi! from the 42. Again on the ground. Very short game. He gets set up. Harris does. By Jacob Phillips. Second and long. Garrett said enough of this. I got to get involved. I got to hit somebody. At least he's able to collapse down and get involved. Usually you'll see him get down in there and get his shoulder into the ribs of a running back. He collapses down. He's just able to get his arms in there to try to help Phillips here to bring down Najee Harris. I'm sure he's frustrated by that first half. Frustrated, too. I mean, he's missing Jadeveon Clowney, who gives them some bookend pass rushers, ankle injury. Great point. Inactive tonight. Second and seven. Off play action. Settles underneath. He does, he loves to do that. Najee Harris. Hurdling for a first down. Sure does. He did that in college Alabama. This is a great play with a jet sweep action with the rookie, George Pickens. There he is. He goes up and over a defender. Over Martin Emerson on that play. Trubisky. Protection is really good, but the coverage is good as well. He settles for Harris underneath. Anthony Walker reads it perfectly. No game. I was kind of kidding in our meeting this morning because I've watched Najee since he was a freshman. A goal for Cleveland. Bush makes the tackle. And full round, Betonio again, one of the top guards, pro bowler and left guard. They seal it to the right on the edge. We've seen this play a couple times now, that pin and pull. Watch the receivers doing their job. He just want to free up Big 75, give him a chance to blow somebody up, which he does. Remember, this is Pittsburgh Steelers defense. They've played more snaps than anybody in these first two weeks. Now you've got a short week, trying to rotate as many bodies in as they can to stay fresh. On a first and goal, Brissette in the pocket, fires, caught! Touchdown! David Njoku. They go 71 yards, nine plays. Takes a little less than six minutes. Back up on top of the Browns. And they dial up Edmonds again. The safety inside and has outside leverage. Watch him drop to the outside, making it easy for Joku to be able to work on that glance route for the touchdown. Again, Brissette in rhythm and in timing with the receivers and tight ends. He's 11 of 16 for 92 yards. The extra point off the upright is no good. So York, the big hero, 58-yard field goal on opening day, but missed extra points last week. Didn't look to be consequential, but it was. Missed extra point here, and it's 13-7. This is the year. This is the year. Right. They have a good team this year. One of these years, it will be the year. Well, this Browns secondary, although they're talented and experienced, They've had some miscues that have cost them giving up some big touchdowns. If you notice, one common theme is zone coverage. Miscommunication. Bust. This was last week. Letting him back out of the backfield. You can see Delpit turn around and kind of shrug his shoulders. Here, is it the safety? Delpit. Is it the corner? It's zone. So tonight, you're seeing a lot more communication. Everybody getting on the same page. Big emphasis of that this week by this defense. and the staff. From the 25, they begin this drive, rolling right, throwing. That's caught. Eight-yard game. Deontay Johnson steps out of bounds. And I think the other thing we're seeing is all those busts were in zone coverage. Tonight, they're playing a lot more man-to-man with Joe Woods, the defensive coordinator, trying to lock these receivers up. Although the Steelers, coming into this game, they've not done a good job of getting the ball downfield. they've made a much better attempt at giving these receivers a chance to make plays against that man coverage. Brown's defense had a players-only meeting this week. Players-only meetings are not that unusual, but they certainly are after two weeks. Absolutely, yeah. Second down and two at the 33. Harris started to stumble but maintains his balance long enough to pick up the first down. I wouldn't be surprised to see Matt Canada go back to mixing in the tempo. You know, that last drive where they were able to drive, you mixed up tempo. They had different formations, personnel groups. They were running the football. They were taking some shots. They were running some boots, moving the launch point. Just a real good job of mixing things up and keeping the Browns' defense off balance. Trubisky, seven of his first eight for 73 yards. play action, look out, escapes to his right, fires caught in Brown's territory Deontay Johnson again is the man Harris threw a nice block that time he sure did, he took out Jacob Phillips this is what he brings to the table his athletic ability, 50 Phillips comes in, there's the block Al you're talking about and then he's able to pull away from a that's a block with a capital D and an exclamation point and Harris chugs his way to the 43-yard line for a gain of five. I think we all felt on the Zoom yesterday when we got done talking with the Steelers, Trubisky has a little bit of an edge to him, a little bit of an attitude, and I think he's maybe had that his whole career where people have doubted him. Things didn't go that well in Chicago. Last year he was in Buffalo and now here. And people are already saying, hey, you ever heard of the rookie? You ever heard of Ryan Pickett? And he's just, I think he's fed up, and he's shown up tonight ready to play football. There is Pickett, who is the only quarterback pick in either of the first two rounds in the draft. Jalen Warren's now back in the game. Low center gravity, really hard to find. They list him at 5'8", and is physical. I think we talked about Najee Harris, how many carries he had last year. The wear and tear, potentially, even as a rookie. I think Warren, who had a great camp, won that backup job over Benny Snell, can become that guy that can give him some reps and some series off. You don't lose a lot. This young man can play. Second and seven from the 28-yard line. Trubisky to his left. Catch is made. Johnson with a nice move to the inside to the 39-yard line. Tackled there by Denzel Ward. First half for the Steelers. Matt Cano to the offensive coordinator who's been under fire in Pittsburgh about the play calling and about the lack of results. Two touchdowns in two games. Moving the launch point around. and really respects Myles Garrett and his ability to rush this quarterback. Going quick game here, fast pace, no huddle. He ended up about seven by Warren. The reason he wasn't drafted, what do you think, size? Yeah, I think so. I mean, you know, they're always looking for measurables, especially in the NFL, you're looking for that power back. But I'll tell you, he looks in the mirror and he sees a 230-pound running back. I mean, he's that kind of guy. Second and three. on the move down the sideline and reaching up for it is George Pickens and he hauls it in. So the rookie who looks so good in preseason and sparingly played the first two weeks makes a great catch. Rookie on rookie and what a catch with the right hand by George Pickens. This is a guy that's known when he was in college at Georgia vertical stretch the defense make plays, incredible ball steals and he says quiet. Gain of 36. Going Mellohill here. While Warren makes the ball to the 12-yard line. Second down. You know, Trubisky has been ridiculed because he's being too conservative. Little slant and go. Pretty good coverage by the rookie corner, but just in an unbelievable location of the ball and a great catch. Taking the second round. Here's Warren again. Setting up a First down and goal as he takes it to the five-yard line. I told you you like this guy, right? He runs hard, and like I said, the linebackers have a hard time knowing where he is. They used that jet sweep that time with Pickens, kind of slowed the linebackers down a bit, and gave Warren that much more room to be able to work to get the first down. So the rookies have done it on this drive. Meanwhile, they've been going no huddle, but right now they will huddle up and go to the other side of the field, but that's going to take us to the end of the first quarter. With the score, Cleveland 7, Pittsburgh nothing. Thursday night football continues after the game. After Warren did the heavy lifting to this point. Harris, flag thrown. And Harris for the moment gets into the end zone. You saw the flag. Clay Martin is the referee. He will give us the goal. It's going to stand as a touchdown. Defense number 21 lining up in the lethal zone. He'll win the cards. He goes to the play as a touchdown. Yeah, that was Denzel Ward. He was trying to take the receiver out of the play and cross the line. How about this? John Johnson in safety trying to come up and run support. And Najee Harris, when he gets that momentum going, the stiff arm just throws Johnson off of him. And crosses that goal line. Now Boswell to try to tie the game. High snapper, they get it down. Marvin able to place it perfectly. 7-7. So back in 2014, Odell Beckham in New York made one of the great catchers of all time. In fact, my partner at the time, Chris Collins, said best he ever saw. But he has spawned a whole generation of guys who make similar catches. Yeah, they practice these kind of catches. But what is impressive to me in this case is the strength in his hand, that right hand, to hit the ground and hold on to the ball. I mean, think about that. All that momentum, he brings the ball in, and that ball doesn't move at all. He holds on to that. So, tremendous athletic ability, freakish skills, and a heck of a throw, by the way, by Trubisky. So, the two guys who felt some heat in Pittsburgh, Matt Canada, Mitch Trubisky, What a drive by both of them, mixing up the tempo and then finishing it here with Najee Harris into the end zone. This game started out like we were going to get a punt-a-thon, but now two good-looking drives, one by each team. Five seconds into the second, tied at seven. Winner, early in the season, obviously, goes in. Coming off the young receiver, David Bell. You're going to see Ndoku, the tight end, work out to the flat. You can't see as Sutton comes off of his receiver and gets his foot in the ground and is able to disrupt the timing there. Great job using his eyes. Clean play there by Sutton. Njoko been targeted nine times. It's the first incomplete to him. Eight catches, nine targets. Empty again. Second down and ten. Blitz coming. Picked it up. Incomplete. And not even turning around. It's the back of Witherspoon with the coverage on the play. It'll be third down. Yeah, you hear that rip, rip, rip. I mean, the offensive line's going to have to move to their right, sensing that blitz coming from the backer, which it did, and they were able to pick it up. Just the timing not quite there. He threw that ball to the inside. Witherspoon with good coverage. He didn't have his head turned around, or that would have been an interception. They're two for two in the red zone. They've been down here and come away with two touchdowns. Now they've got a third and long. 3rd and 10 from the 16. Percet in the pocket. Fires over the middle. And that will be Kareem Hunt. But they're short of the first down. And it's going to be 4th. What are they going to say? Incomplete or complete? 4th down. Going to bring it back. Like you said, either way it's going to be 4th down. It looks like as soon as he hit his hands, it bounced down and then back up into his hands. Right. So it will be incomplete and make that kick with this wind a little bit tougher. Cost him about eight yards. Again, kicking into what would, to a manner, well, there's Witherspoon shaking up. So the cornerback goes out. Meanwhile, you've got a chance for Cleveland to take the lead. But nothing is automatic even though York did kick that 58 yarder on opening day became the toast of the town Missed an extra point tonight, too. He did and last week last week as well This is going to be a 34 yard attempt For the only kicker who is chosen in the entire draft Can they take the lead? The hook has to hold it And this one is true. 34 yards. Browns back on top. Cleveland leading 16-14 on Thursday Night Football. They come and go. It's a culture, right? Starts with ownership, down to the head coach. There's that continuity where they see things through the same lens. Well, you look at the Steelers, three head coaches in 53 years. There have been five Roman Catholic popes. and, well, two monarchs and up-to-date in Great Britain. Pretty good run, right? Yeah, I would say. Would you stack that ownership up with all the professional sports up near the top? Well, you won six Super Bowls, right? I'm just saying, of everybody, including everybody, the Rooney family right there. No question. On the 25-yard line on first down. See if the Steelers can get things going here. They came out to start the second half. We talked about it was kind of a sloppy drive. They kind of lost some of the rhythm that they had, moving Trubisky around, mixing up the tempos. Matt Canada and Trubisky had an incredible first half, trying to reestablish that here. Browns now thin it linebacker with those two injuries at the moment and of course Clowney was inactive tonight they're going down the depth chart meanwhile Trubisky has some room and gets tripped up tripped up there by Taki Taki third down That's one another way you handle Miles Garrett is you don't you don't have to block it. You just read him. You know, read the big man. Don't block him. If he collapses down, pull it out. Something that Trubisky did a bunch in college. Very comfortable with that. Played in North Carolina. Third down and three. Extra man coming. Pass. Johnson cannot hold it in. Deontay Johnson was there. Denzel Ward right with him. Fourth down. This time, Miles Garrett is there and applies the pressure. But let's give Trubisky a lot of credit. He knows 95's coming on his blind side. But he locks in and makes a great throw to the outside shoulder of Deontay Johnson. He somehow lets that ball get through his hands. Should have caught that football. Harvin, his third punt of the night. A wobbly one. Angled toward the far side, but stays inbound. Gets lucky to get some extra yardage on the bounce. Browns starting from the 20-yard line. To Cincinnati, we go. As Bill Belichick might have said at one point, on to Cincinnati. And we will go on to Cincinnati. That is the Miami Dolphins. The Red Hot Dolphins. off that miracle win against Baltimore, against the Bengals. How about two of last week? Six touchdowns. And that sixth one, when it really counted, I mean, that game was going back and forth. Everybody's talking about leading into this season, Tyreek Hill, what he would mean to two in this offense. And first couple weeks, they sure are living up to it. Throwing Jalen Waddell as well. Oh, yeah, crazy game last week, and hopefully another one next week. Down in Cincinnati. There's Chubb. He cuts on a dime. Picks up five. They're mixing up the run with some pass from Brissette. What we've seen a lot of tonight is just getting the ball out. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. A lot of these throws, under two and a half seconds. Tough to get pressure on him, especially when he puts that foot in the ground. He's throwing in rhythm. He's got open targets against that zone defense that Steelers have played a lot of tonight. He's seeing coverage very, very well. Final half minute of the third. Second and five. Chubb again. And the fourth quarter is likely to begin with a third down and one. You can see, by the way, Wills back in the lineup at left tackle. We saw him go down into the locker room and now back out to the Browns' offensive line. To the fourth we go with Cleveland on top, 16-14 on Thursday Night Football. The 14, Al Michaels, Kirk Kirkstreet, Keeley Hartung. We start with a third and one from the 29-yard line. Off play action. Brissette's going to go deep downfield. Wide open. Cooper to the 40-yard line. Tackle by Sutton. How about that call on a third down and one? What a call. You're thinking, of course, they're going to run this ball. It's man-to-man on the outside. play action. Now look at the top. One-on-one with Amari Cooper against Sutton. You take that, you throw the ball away from Sutton, you let your man run to it. Great job. One of the best route runners in the league. Amari Cooper getting that separation in and call. Heck of a call there by Kevin Stavansky. Bold call. Berry. Seven catches and 101 yards for Cooper tonight. To the ground again. Another great move by Chubb. Bouncing off Bowling Pinch to the 23-yard line. He goes. And that's over 100 yards tonight for Nick Chubb. Again, this is zone play off to the left. Designed to the left. Puts the foot in the ground. Little jump cut. The vision off of that block by Wyatt Teller. And this defense, remember, they're on the ropes. They came in defending the most plays of anybody in the league. And now you've got to deal with this. Look at that line getting a great push. They trust their back to use his vision and be able to find that hole, either play side or back side. And run defense has been a big problem. New England proved that last week. Running out the clock was six and a half minutes. Here's Hunt now. Big hole. Kareem Hunt. Gain of eight. And a Pocic block. Second and short. That's a great effort by Pocic because he ends up making a block. He has to work to the right on a reach block. Watch him work to the right and then turn his body, his backside, to the hole. That gives him and Hunt plenty of room. And you can see Teller just up to the linebacker. Just a clinic right now up front with the Browns offensive line. Browns 146 rushing yards, second and two. Moore coming here. Gets the two he needs. Hunt does. Highsmith makes the tackle. You talked about that last 6'33". They're trying to get the ball back last week against the Patriots. To the credit of New England, they took advantage of a worn-down Pittsburgh defense. And Stefanski, using the one-two punch of Chubb and Hunt in a veteran offensive line, they knew if they could get Mike Tomlin's defense into the fourth quarter, they could try to lean on him and try to wear him down. Great balance in the Cleveland offense tonight. 147 rushing yards, 203 through the air. Third and inches. There he goes. Percet not only picks up one, a lot more as well. This is what I love about this guy. Look at him. He's taking ownership of this team. He's going, I know who's coming week 13, but, you know, I'm going to show you what I got right now. Yeah, and the crowd feeds off of it. Watch this line. I thought he was going to slip through there. He keeps his legs driving. He almost goes into like a peewee play. He almost goes into the end zone. Love the fire from seven. Love it. first and goal at the eight yard line hunt the running back give it to him Kareem Hunt doing his thing picks up five that's on Petonio as good as it gets at guard leading the way he's been pulling all night and this time he just blows up a defender just no chance He should pull around from the left over here and just makes a heck of a block. Just boom. Gives Hunt again another jump cut underneath. Looking at the best, maybe the best left guard in the National Football League tonight. It's the least glamorous position, but he's made it a beauty contest. Hunt to the outside. Gets stuck at the one yard line. Teller that time leading the way. He pulled. Third and goal. And they're going to run the same thing this time. They're going to try to run it over to the left side. Bush, who's been active, he's just trying to hold up here late in this game. Takes a hit, keeps going, and then holds on and slams him to the ground. Good job of working through traffic there by Devin Bush. Just outside the one on a third and goal. Or set out of the gun. Hands it. And can he chug his way in? No. Hunt again. Fourth and goal. Well, Chris warmly gets there initially, getting off of his block from Wyatt Teller. And you can see the rest of that defense. Fitzpatrick, who we've not called his name much tonight at all, in there helping make a push as well. Chubb comes back in on fourth and goal. You think Prisette tries to sneak in? Four for four in there? I don't know. Put hold in there at fullback and give the ball to Chubb. Makes it look easy. Touchdown. Fourth and goal. First time of the night. They bring a left guard throw hold in to play fullback. Helps to lead the way. Chuck to the end zone. Why not throw in another offensive lineman? What's great is you got Petonio also in there helping just make sure that their talented running back has enough room to get that touchdown. Big extra point here to turn it into a two-possession game. Right now an eight-point lead. York tries to make it nine. A wobbly kick, but through it goes to make it a 23-14 Cleveland advantage. That drive, six and a half minutes. A talented and experienced offensive line. They ran 11 plays on that drive, 10 runs, trying to wear down this defense, and it works. Mixed up different styles of inside, outside, and then right at them to put the ball into the end zone to give them this nine-point lead. That Pittsburgh defense, they had to defend 94 plays against Cincinnati. There you go. When you have Chubb and Hunt, easy to do. They had 66 plays. They defended last week, and tonight Cleveland's already run 60 plays. And he bombs that one into the stands. So let's take a look at the upcoming schedules. So for the Steelers, they get the Jets at home in 10 days. But then look at that. At 8.15 p.m. Eastern Time, right here on Prime Video. You're going to see the frustration on the sideline. It's a young team, a lot of emotion. Receivers want opportunities to make plays. We saw that last week. It looked better in the first half, but it's not gone their way in the second half. From the 49. You know, as Hunt picks up, too, the narrative in a town that would, if they go to 1-2, is normally about the offense. But I think the neck as quickly as he can. Well, that tells you something, too. The record 52-24-2 with TJ. 0-5. Tonight they go to 0-6 if they don't come from behind here. They just took a timeout. Have to conserve the clock. With 4-12, there is T.J. Watt right there. 4-12 left in the fourth. Second and eight. Handed to Chubb. And he'll get taken down at the 48-yard line. That's Cameron Hayward, whose brother also plays on it. His brother is nine years younger than him. He was drafted. Connor Hayward, tight end. What a pro Cameron Hayward is. And he's still out there as good as ever. He's been playing 12 years out of Ohio State. He's a big, strong man. He's his younger brother out of Michigan State, the tight end HVAC. Much 97 on the edge. And, of course, they've been moving him outside, especially against the run, where T.J. Watt would normally be. They've been moving a leal there. This time it's big Cam Hayward out there to the outside trying to set the edge. Pop out of Ironhead. That's right. That's right. And it is late dead. Third and ten at the 49-yard line. Percet, he'll get sacked at the 41-yard line. That's Alex Heisman, who had three on opening day off Burrow. Sets up fourth down. Watch this inside move. You know again we keep talking about with T Watt down who can apply the pressure most notably Alex Highsmith Goes with a little bit of an outside move to Wills and then he gives him a spin move back to the inside Actually accelerates through that spin and there's nothing Brissette could do. Great move there by Highsmith. Browns take the play clock down. Pittsburgh will save its last time out here. They'll get the ball with a little over three to play in regulation. And Borges sends it down toward Olszewski. And lets it bound, out of bounds, inside the 20-yard line with 3-13 left in the fourth. Remember, the question about Cleveland's defense was, they played good for three quarters, they get into the fourth quarter, and then they have some miscues. Up to this point, the last three possessions, three three and outs, for Joe Woods' defense. So communication was a big emphasis this week. Everybody being on the same page. No busts, especially in zone coverage. They've had three straight possessions where they've played very well. Yeah, Pittsburgh three straight, three and outs. From the 20, Trubisky surveys, fires, and along the sideline it is caught. Inbounds by Deontay Johnson. his seventh catch of the night. That time Trubisky sat in that pocket, didn't bail out on it. Potential there of Miles Garrett getting to him, but he trusts his offensive line and makes a good throw to the outside where only Johnson can make a play on it and a heck of an effort by Johnson keeping his feet inbounds. First down, fires into traffic, and a great catch is made first of the night by the tight end Friamuth, who had a great rookie season. First time he's been targeted tonight. How about that throw by Trubisky? Again, standing in that pocket, not bailing unnecessarily, stands in there and makes a good throw behind Jacob Phillips here. Quickly to the 41 pass. That one is caught by Friamuth. Doesn't catch a pass for the first, like, 57 minutes. Now back-to-back. finding some holes in that zone behind the backers in front of the safeties. When you make that throw, it's got to be on a line, which he's doing. Two and a half to go. Trubisky going for it all now, and it is in the end zone incomplete because he was out of bounds. Emerson coming down with what looked to be for the moment the interception pickens the intended receiver out of bounds. The right foot by Emerson as soon as he came down was out of bounds. Heckman effort again. We saw Pickens make that circus catch. He tried to make another one with the one hand. The right foot right there once he secures the ball. Good call, Al. Happens quick. Didn't it look like Pickens was trying to make that same catch with the right hand? For sure. He knows how to do it. He sure does. All of a sudden, blink of an eye. They move the ball down. Feel quickly. Got a shot here. They've gone 54 yards, four plays in 50 seconds. Second down and 10 from the 26. Trubisky fires to the outside. That's caught. And trying to get out of bounds is Pickens, but he can't clock. Keeps rolling. Approaching the two-minute warning. It'll be third down and six. trying to get a playoff before the two-minute stoppage, and they're able to. It's Trubisky with a flag thrown, and that is incomplete. A flag was thrown, might not have been set. Ward covering on the play, got another flag down there as well. Deontay Johnson kind of nonchalantly getting back into position to get lined up. He was never lined up. Two flags, one at the 23, one at the 2. At the end of the call here, that'll take us to the two-minute warning with the buck 57. He's not even set as the ball is snapped. There are fouls by both teams on the play. Illegal shift. Offense is not all 11 players set prior to the snap. Pass interference. Defense, number 21. Those penalties offset at the previous spot. It'll be played so down. So with 157, it'll be third down and five on the other side of this two-minute break. The way it started, I thought we were going to have 100 points tonight. Yeah, yeah. Eat nothing. Of course, you and I are headed to Knoxville tonight. It's a busy weekend. Excuse me? Yeah, you're going to be a celebrity picker at the end of the show. Oh, sure, yeah. Right. I want to put on the Corso head. That's my dream. You should take the elf down there with you. Third down and five with 157. Left in the fourth. Trout in full throat. Only a three-man rush, and Trubisky has to fire a dart that's incomplete. Tried to get it to try a move. Jacob Phillips has played a nice game tonight. I'll tell you what, Jacob Phillips in coverage. Doing a really good job. Showing blitz, kind of walked up here. They got all their backers a little bit tight. He's looking for a crosser. There it is. it beats him initially but the length the arm length is able to extend and knock that ball away before Friar Moose can make the catch 39 yard attempt to try to make it a one possession game Chris Boswell and the Browns had I think the Browns had 12 guys on the field there's a flag down at the goal line Boswell looking around the kick went through the uprights But was the plate blown dead before the snap? I think that's the call here. 12 men on the field in formation on the defense. 12-yard penalty. Still fourth down. Have to do it again at least five yards closer this time. That drive Kevin Stefanski crazy. Third time tonight. Yeah. We've seen the Browns with 12 men on the field. Got to get communication. everybody get on the same page there it is the dirty dozen 151 on the clock Danny Smith is the special teams coordinator right there he's got a little gum going on oh yeah Danny's been around a while good guy really good guy Tomlin wanted to know why, you know, the play was blown dead. Terry, quickly, though, I mean, if 12 guys on the field, they throw the flag, the play is dead at that point, right? Absolutely, out. 12 men were in formation with a snap imminent. It's a dead ball foul. No play. Okay, so now you've got a 34-yard attempt to try to make it a 6.5. game and keep Pittsburgh in the game. Which he does. So it's 23-17. We're going to stay. No commercial break here. So 148. You only have one timeout so you're pretty much compelled to come on. Yeah, I think you're going to have to. Mike Tomlin still wants an explanation. I think he's still staring out at the head referee and have a little discussion with him. So Terry, what is it that Martin is telling Tomlin right now, do you think? I assume he's explaining the rule, Al. That's the only thing I can think of because there's no way you can have a snap take place with 12 in formation and the snap imminent. It has to be a dead ball foul. Anyway, the kick was good. I thought about, you know, they were fourth and one there after the penalty. You know, I mean, I know you need two possessions. You just take the three points. I think you have to at that point. If you don't get it, the game is over. Meanwhile, you've got the hands team out there. They're going to try an onside kick here. the Browns know all about onside kicks don't they and it was Amari Cooper who took the blame last week saying he should have burrowled it but he didn't and the Jets won the game Cooper is up here to the left the Jets kicked to the left this time it looks like at least initially Steelers might be going the other direction So we'll see what Boswell has in mind. He's been successful on a few of these in his career. Has to go ten yards. Hopping, bouncing. It's loose again. And a flag is thrown as the ball goes out of bounds. going to be against the Steelers. I think it's Trey Norwood, 21 at the bottom. Just got an early start. Yeah. That's a killer. Oh, yeah, for them. Browns again had a hard time recovering that. Yes, they did. Peace. All the way at the bottom there. Yeah, you can see it. Yep. Right along the sideline. Got an early start. Martin to make it official here. Play Martin. Offside. Kicking team. Number 14. Five yards to be added to the NFL spot. First down Cleveland. Yeah, that's George Pickens. so the rookie who made that fabulous catch earlier is the first guy across the line and that in effect will write a finish to this one even though the Steelers have one timeout I'm not writing a finish to any game these days no, not after last week so Brissette leads them up Brissette tonight 21-31 220 yards, two touchdowns Nothing fancy coming here And put big Michael Dunn in at fullback Back up center Saw him in the goal line package lined up there So doing the quick math here Pulling time out quickly You still have a few seconds left Before a fourth down play So Cleveland's going to have to Run it all the way to the end unless it's a first down here. And Chubb takes it to the 43-yard line. So you run a second down play, and that's going to take you down to a minute. And then you go to fourth down with about 20 seconds, roughly, or a little bit more. Or you get a first down. Or you get a first down and you forget about everything. Right. He's going to set up a third and one. so they can pretty much end it right here with a one yard gain Nick Chubb well maybe if it's Patrick who was off to a blazing start had a pick six in the opener interception last week but tonight haven't called his name very often and I think if you go back to our meeting yesterday with Reset first thing he's doing after he breaks the huddle he's going to locate 39 they've been trying to work away from him as much as they can Yeah, it's interesting because we were talking to Mahomes last week before the Kansas City game And he said the first guy I looked for is Derwin James Who plays that same role basically for the Chargers Second and seven Chubb, and this time he can't get out of the backfield So they finally stop him That's Alex Highsmith making the tackle for a loss Crashed that play tired of seeing Chubb run away from him and just chases it down from behind. You know, with T.J. Watt down, the mantel has swung over to 56. Highsmith, and you can see there's just nothing they could do there. He's used that speed and doesn't hesitate. He was very decisive there in being able to make that play into the backfield. Third and 12, if nothing else, they're milking that play clock here. Absolutely. Under six minutes to go. Nine-point lead. Hunt is the back. Persept fires Oh and Cooper had it Couldn't hold on Right there Couldn't hold it Big night for Cooper but a drop here After seven catches And Persept put a little bit more on that one He got back on his last step And just fired an absolute seed Anticipates it Leads him into that hole And it just goes right off of his face mask what you couldn't see in super slow-mo is there was some smoke coming off the back of that football. Like a 100-mile-an-hour fastball. Right there. Olszewski is back. The Hork has to punt. His third kick of the night. Olszewski lets it bounce. Can the bounce down it? Yes, they can to pin him at the 5-yard line. Perfect. The first half. I mean, this is one of the great catches you will ever see. Yeah, a great throw, but we're all going to be talking about the catch. One-handed grab comes down. The strength to be able to hold on to that football as he comes to the ground. It did not move. He got it secured. Showed what he's capable of doing when Trubisky throws the ball downfield at 14. And that's George Pickens, second-round pick out of Georgia. Here he is, right to the right. They're backed up from their own six-yard line. Trubisky rolling and throwing, and that's thought Claypool making the grab for a gain of about seven yards, second down. That's what we saw a lot of in the first half, just moving that launch point. It does a couple things. It gets you away from Miles Garrett and rolled away from him there, but it also puts your quarterback where he's most comfortable. He loves to move to the outside and throws with much better rhythm and accuracy. Second and three to the outside. A little underthrown and it is incomplete. Johnson could not pull it in. Third down and three with 5.04 left. Watch what Garrett does here. Sometimes it's not about the sack. It's about running over the left tackle. Dan Moore, both these guys from Texas A&M, he goes over top of him. It actually affects the throw. You see Trubisky couldn't step into that throw. He kind of had to fall back as he's throwing this ball couldn't get anything on it And that's why he couldn't get it to a wide open receiver for the first down Sometimes he's okay credit for a sack which everybody looks at but you may have plays like that which never show up on the statue third down and three To this he has to step away from pressure down he goes in the ten-yard line chased by Jacob Phillips Got two starting linebackers out, so Jacob Phillips is one who's had to step in. These blitzing linebackers spooked Trubisky. We saw that last week on film. Both of them walked up, and you're going to see Jacob Phillips get home. Puts a lot of pressure on that offensive line. Najee Harris over late. Phillips is able to get home and bring him down. Harbin, who's averaging 39 yards on three punts. Rodgers spins and takes it back to midfield with 4.18. Matchup next week to Cincinnati. And we go the Dolphins, who right now are 2-0, taking on the Bengals, who are 0-2. The AFC reigning champions kick off Buffalo. Tampa Bay at home at Red Hot Miami at Red Hot Philadelphia. Meanwhile, the Browns go to Atlanta in 10 days. Then the Chargers and Patriots come in here back-to-back at Baltimore and Cincinnati at home. Much tougher for Pittsburgh. Yeah, it absolutely is. The way Philly's playing right now. from the 25-yard line. Harris gets tripped up in the backfield. No game. Let's not forget where this offense was a week ago. Tough week, short week. They've looked a lot better. Matt Cannon has put together a nice plan. It's not been as good in this second half. They haven't had the ball much in this second half because of the Browns offense. They got to put it together now, the way they were moving the ball early in this game. Receivers got to get separation, and Trubisky's going to need time to throw. Under nine minutes to play. Trubisky, good protection, fires into traffic and incomplete. Hended there for Chase Claypool, broken up by the former Ram John Johnson, third and ten. Taki Taki does a pretty good job himself. The linebacker here just kind of sinking back. It's a tight window, like you said. Al, watch this. I mean, he's trying to go over top of Taki Taki. And you also have Johnson in there. Eventually comes up and hits play pool to separate him from the ball. You think Taki Taki is a tick-tock? Well, never mind. I was waiting. I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry. I put it on the tee. Third and ten. And the left guard moves. Kevin Dutton. Awesome five. In the last two games, the first two games of the year, this Cleveland defense, they've been in a position to close games out, and they've had breakdowns. This is where you try to become a different team, a team that's going to learn from the states, a team that's ready to be serious about this year. They've got to make sure they're on the same page on the back end. Faced only six third downs and converted just once. Third and 15. Have to get to the 35-yard line. The pass is too high and incomplete. And that is a very fast three and out. 47 seconds worth. That's two straight three and outs. defense that's already on the ropes back out onto the field think about what they've had to deal with in this second half with the way the Browns have been moving the ball especially on the ground Browns have run 60 plays still at 8.5 to play Harvin's kick fielded on the run at the 34 yard line and taken down at the 39 this has just activated Chester Rogers 8.5 to go in northern Ohio. What is going on at the 50-yard line? That is Brownie the Elf, right? Yeah. That's the new logo. He was the mascot when the team first came in to professional football in the All-America Football Conference in 1946. And I'll tell you the rest of the story in a second as they start this drive with a two-yard game by Chip. So they had a fan poll. And, you know, was it going to be a dog in the middle? Was it going to be the helmet? Instead, this was the logo that won. Now, you tell me what you think. Okay? Honestly? No. I mean, I'm not. I don't. Dishonestly. I don't. I'm not a fan, man. What used to be at the 50? Well, they had the Browns helmet, which is the simplest of helmets. And then I think there was nothing the last couple of years, so they took a fan poll. And this is what won. Browning the Elf, you tell me. Ready, set. Second to the knee. I always say thumbs down. What do you think? Well, first of all, you've got the Joko right there with Brown and the Elf picking up the first down. The fans loved it because when he was the mascot in the early years, they won a lot of championships. So maybe they're trying to bring back some luck here. Elf luck. Well, this is a football team that has a chance to be very competitive this year. if they can stay healthy. Everyone wants to talk about Deshaun Watson coming back. In the meantime, they've got a quarterback in these first few weeks that is really doing a good job of just managing the game and just being in control. The experience has really shown. He doesn't want to be called a game manager. He's been more than that tonight for sure. Three-yard game here by Chubb. Lombardi trophy. You and I are moving on to Cincinnati. We are. We are. Well, it's your home anyway, right? Yeah. Yeah, that would be great. You get mileage, right? You're going to have a big meal next week. It's a good town. Old stomping grounds here. This is kind of crazy to have this kind of a delay to look at what? Terry, get to the bottom of this, will you? What's going on? Help them out. So they're going to rule him short. We've heard from him. They're going to rule him short. And then they're going to have a 10-second runoff. Okay. From the point he's down. Okay. All right, so you go to 40 and you go to 25 on the play clock. so they do have to do something with this here. After last week, everybody just keep your seat belt on. Exactly right. No, there would be a lot of psychiatry appointments if this one didn't wind up in Cleveland's favor tomorrow. All right, so fourth and inches. come up to the line here wine the clock yes he's gonna shake his time they can take it all the way down to about 15 Steelers have to make sure they don't jump or that would anything Cleveland also has a timeout and they're gonna use it you're gonna use There you go. So now 14 seconds. Rams take the timeout. All right. What do you call here? Well, he's bringing his punter out. So his punter has been pinning Pittsburgh back and shows you the confidence he has in the long snapper. Put him back. Just get it off, obviously. absolutely and Steelers now send one man back Charlie you look to snap it Corey before kids is the hunter And she sets up at the 50-yard line. And the Steelers will put a mad rush on. Gets it away. This will take a lot of time off the clock. And it will bound out of bounds at the 4-yard line. So now you've got 9 seconds to go 96 yards. What do you got in the playbook? But for a team that lost last week on offense and defense and special teams, it wasn't just a defense for the Browns breaking down. It was everybody. Tonight, nine seconds away from a win where everybody helps out. That's how you really grow as a team early in the season when everybody is able to contribute, and you learn from a setback from a week ago. Where does the ring go? Sorry, don't come easy. That's exactly right. I think so. Whatever it is When it comes to that, it's all you. There we go Trubisky throwing It's the old Stanford band play Back at the four yard line Into the end zone it goes and the Browns are going to recover there Denzel Ward That's going to be a touchdown. There's no extra point but that may be meaningful to some of you. And you know who I mean. 29-17. The Browns win it. Well, Garrett may have forced the fumble. I think the ball just kind of came out on the lateral. It's on the ground, and Ward's able to come up with a touchdown. Looks good in the stat sheet for Denzel Ward end of the year. Well, don't go anywhere. The postgame show is coming right over 100 yards tonight. Boy, the second time in his career he's gone over 100 yards against his Steelers defense. 113 yards tonight, averaging over 5 yards per carry. The long was 37. Third and one. Crowd yelling for Chubb. Yeah. I don't blame him. Or Brissette. A little too far for him. It's like a yard and a half. And they let the clock run down here and take a timeout. So it's still 31. By the way, the end of summer. Happy autumn to you. Same to you. It's official. Earl. 54 seconds. Can they get the yard? And write an official finish for this one. Chubb. Close. Right there. Clock keeps rolling. Might be close enough for a measurement. Brown say we have it. Pittsburgh says, nope, you don't have it. Martin will stop the clock and bring in the change. Of course, if they're short, they'll run the clock. You still have 29 on the play clock, so there'll be a little bit of time, minimally, at the end. it's two teams three weeks in obviously you've got stuff to work on but it's brown's team without the sean watson there's some pieces here you know this is a team that i think feels different than they have in the past got a lot of speed here well let the celebration begin and the big question in pittsburgh is going to be about the rookie of course ryan pickett it's already started. I thought Trubisky Kenny Pickett, I thought Trubisky played much better tonight, but with a long, you know, you've got 10 days now to get ready there's going to be a lot of buzz. Mike Tomlin's been very secure in saying, nope, we're not ready to talk about it, but you know that's going to be talked about quite a bit over the course of the next week and a half. One of the things he has to think about, they have the Jets at home, but then after that we saw how tough that schedule is. Yeah. I think they're going to review the spot. No game ends without something going to Park Avenue. Stens that. Looks like it. Look at that. Watch him. See, they're trying to see where the ball is, where that knee is down. Yep. Terry, are you seeing anything we're not seeing? No, same thing you're seeing. We've got the knee down. It looks to me like the ball is short when that knee hits. We kind of lose it, but to get a first down, he'd have to be much further beyond where it is. So I do believe this is short. Okay. So they measured. What does that mean? unless you have Gene Steratore's index card. Doesn't matter, right? By the way, in defense of Trubisky, I think you and I see kind of the same thing. I thought the guy played better tonight. I thought the line played better. I don't know if this is the time to just panic and give up on what he can do for you. I agree with you. And I go back to what we said at the beginning of the game with Tomlin. Look, nobody knows his team better than Mike. And if you start listening to the fans, as the saying goes, you'll start leaving. You'll be sitting with him pretty soon. He has such wisdom. He sees it through his own lens, and he's able to focus on what he needs to do for his team. You know, the other quarterback is always the most popular guy in town, right? Oh, especially the rookie from Pitt, right? The Heisman final. I think back to when Tom Brady had a bad game on a Monday night in 2014 in Kansas City. No. And everybody, that was the famous game where the press is saying, it's time for Garoppolo to start. Oh, yeah. Brady's done. And that's when Belichick said it's on to Cincinnati. Right? Every question. How'd that year wind up? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. We're moving on to Cincinnati. Yeah. The year wound up with a lot.
