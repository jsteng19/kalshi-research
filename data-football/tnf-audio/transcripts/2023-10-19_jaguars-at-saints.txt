 Leaping for it, well short of the first, is Agnews. And now you've got a fourth down and a couple. Vaughn makes the tackle. And we're back in 30 seconds as the Saints are going to get Jordan to make many plays. He was frustrated with his hold here by the rookie. Harrison, no call. So fourth and two, they'll boot it away. This is Cook's third punt instead of fake. And a first down. Cook. The lefty throws it to Tim Jones. Mainly a special teams guy. He's in on special teams here. But can play receiver. He has three receptions or had three coming into the game. There's number four. 13 yards on a fourth and two. Watch Yedom, who's out there against a gunner. He just kind of loses him. turns his head, and when he turns around, he's catching a football. Completely catches him off guard. He gave him the look like, I'm coming to you. Coming to you. From the 33-yard line, Lawrence fires, caught. To the 26 goes Ingram. Second down, and a timeout taken here. What about Doug Peterson by Jacksonville? The timing of that. I mean, everybody's thinking. I've got to punt it away. They're up 14-6. He's always a guy that's willing to take calculated risks. Go back to the Super Bowl. Everyone knows about the Philly special here. Just an aggressive mindset. And it pays off. It gives Trevor Lawrence a new set of downs and maybe a couple shots at the end zone. You never know. Logan cooked to a nice pass. Yeah, it sure did. He's the punter. He's the holder. He told me in the ten days in England, they got to play four rounds of golf when they were over there. I don't want to give him away, but I did. Second and three. And that's caught. And Kirk, let's see where they spot it. They had a first down initially, and then comes back, and they spot it just shy. For an aggressive defense here, They've been mixing in a little bit more zone here on this series, just relying on that front to try to get home and try to keep the ball in front and rally to it. Defensive line, they've been rotating different players in there, Granderson, Jordan, Brzee, all can win one-on-one battles up front. Third down two. Lawrence, on the time throws and it is picked Lattimore making the big interception that drive ends there intended there for Agnew in a moment in time when they really needed it you know, Agnew is known for jet sweeps and reverses and his speed not necessarily his route running. And I think Lattimore, who's a crafty veteran, plays off, has his eyes on the quarterback, but he doesn't really get fooled to the inside. Able to reverse and then close on it, anticipating that ball's going to be thrown low and away. He's able to lay out and make a play on the ball. It looks like he got his arms under that football before it hit the ground. Yeah, big play. You're either looking at 17-6 or 21-6. They're going to take a peek to see if he got his forearms underneath that football. Terry McCauley, what is your initial assessment here? Yeah, Al, he does get controlled before the ball hits ground, but then the ball does hit the ground, and the ball moves in his hands. This should be an incomplete pass. So, underneath, balls on the ground there. Okay. Interesting. It's like Terry and the boys make the big bucks. Exactly. I don't see the movement the way Terry does. And maybe I'm in awe of the coverage. And how good a play he made on that football. Again, the ruling on the field was an interception. Yeah. So you have to reverse that. That is a pro-bowl play. And does the ground help him control it is the question. Yep. Yeah, the previous shot we just showed, Al, was really the best shot. You saw what they're working with up front. Absolutely. We see it with every team every week. Sipping up in the pocket. Fires caught. And enough for the first down. Just barely needed four. Got five. Pass caught by Alvin Kamara. First down for the Saints. Trey Herndon making the tackle there. For Derek, I think you saw a rare moment at the end of the game last week where he was pretty animated, pretty frustrated. They had some breakdowns in communication with the receivers and him not quite being on the same page. In a short week, they've worked that. And now he's stretched out here to the right with Hill taking a snap. Jason Hill. He's going to keep it. He'll run and picks up about eight yards. And, of course, if you watch the Saints, watch the NFL, you know that that happens with some frequency. Yeah, and it's a good changeup. I mean, you have a guy that can run the zone read. It's a pretty simple read. He collapses. You're going to pull the ball out. That's Josh Allen. He's reading. He clearly takes Jamal Williams. And now you get him to the second level. A couple good blocks out there. And he's trying to stay ahead of the sticks. This is a Jacksonville defense that's going to play a lot of zone. They're going to try to keep the ball in front of them. More of a bend-but-don't-break approach tonight, especially against an offense struggling. So take those positive yards on first down. Six yards, second down and four. Carr stepping away, buying time. Fates gets away, picks up the first down. and rolls out of bounds. Angelo Blackson chasing him. So halfway through the quarter, a couple of first downs here, and the Saints are on the move. Nice to see. I mean, you don't always associate scrambling and creating with Derek Carr, but he reminds me he's athletic enough. That's Trayvon Walker right there that he pump fakes and is able to get around him. He's in his 10th year, 32 years old, the nine years with the Raiders, and here making a play to pick up the yardage he needed. Kamara slips, falls, no game. So in the house tonight is a man who owned this house for about 15 years along with Sean Payton. There's Drew Brees taking a look. And, of course, you know, so many years and there was so much consistency with this team. And they won a Super Bowl post-Katrina got the city back together, helped to get the city revitalized again. So it's a whole different thing now. Derek Carr comes in. Can he be the man, at least for the next few years? Second and 11. Pass is caught on the outside. Nice move there by Chris Olavi. Chris Olavi really coming into his own. And a great rookie year. Number one pick out of Ohio State last year. And another first out for New Orleans. You're going at the corner who's in for Tyson Campbell. And he does a nice job here just getting out in front of him. You know, they're going to play soft. They don't want to give up the big play. So you've got to do yards after the catch. Heck of a job by Lave after the catch being able to shake. Even through the stiff arm out there at Buster Brown to get down the sideline. Back to the ground. Camara for a short gain here. So this drive started back in their own 25. Ninth play upcoming. Both these offenses coming out on a short week with some tempo and some energy and some success. Moving to sticks. And again, that hadn't necessarily been an issue for Pete Carmichael in this offense. It's more about when they get into the red zone, can they come away with points? Obviously that was a major concern last week and really the last two losses. Kendra Miller is now the back. He's a rookie at a TCU. Picked him in the third round. Second and seven. Carr. Incomplete at the 20-yard line tip there. Luokan tipping it away from Olave. So it'll be third down and seven. And they're going to drop him. You're going to safety here, safety eventually here, and then Luokan right away like the Tampa 2 defense where he's just going to get some depth. Great job of coming off of that depth and seeing the crosser. And there's the athletic ability and awareness of the leader of this defense. Ball should have been out in front, probably a completion and a first down. And Lewicon has led the league in tackles in each of the last two seasons. Play clock under five. Third and seven. Pressure put on. He's hit as he throws, and the pass is incomplete. So pressure came in from the backside that time. That's the time Trey Herndon, and the drive bogs down. After three first downs, it's fourth and seven. And with, again, a lot of new pieces up front, and Kamara on the left-hand side. He's looking right, and the blitz trickles late, and then it comes from the lead. And the ball at the Jaguars. 46-yard line, 541 to the half. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Kamara back in. Gets it to Kamara. Bunch of white shirts around him. Takes it to the 43-yard line. They're playing a deep zone at Tampa 2 look with two deep safeties. Middle linebacker getting downfield. So Carr's only option has many times been to just check it down to Kamara. Keep in mind, Alave, only two receptions on the night, 17 yards. Michael Thomas doesn't have a reception. Jack's defensive back has taken most looks downfield away. The Carr is 9 of 18 for 80 yards total. Second and six. Kamara again. And he gets stuck at the 42-yard line. So Camara right now has carried the ball with a little action going on after the play. Seven carries, eight yards. Yeah, and the book would tell you against a team that's playing a lot of zone, you've got to be able to run the football with two safeties that are back. But with this makeshift offensive line, it puts them in a really tough spot. That time not able to climb to get to Devin Lloyd, the backer. Car under pressure gets it away but another shorty Camara there Crowd really letting him have it Car frustrated He was sitting at the end of the game last week He was livid and Aluakon makes the tackle. Fourth down and three. The last time they were in this area, they went for it, and they leave the offense out there again. And even though they didn't blitz, they showed pressure. They ended up just bringing four. You always expect 41, Josh Allen, to be a factor on these passing downs. He's lined up to the offense's left. But they got a good push in the middle that time, too. Hey, hey, 23's the mic. Fourth and three. Gets it away. First down. Just before he gets hit, Kamara makes the catch and picks up the first down. And it gives the crowd something to get a friend of them. And he got that out just in time because Pete, the left tackle, is going up against Josh Allen, who's got seven sacks on the year, just in time before he gets blown up on that fourth down. and we've seen Kamara work, shake it on an option route, work to the middle. That time he works to the outside and Carr was locked in on him, saw that matchup against the linebacker. Here's Jamal Williams. Takes it to the 20-yard line. Angela Blackson makes the tackle under three minutes to play in the first half. Well, Lewicon 23 is really an extension of Mike Caldwell, like a defensive coordinator out on the field. He and Devin Lloyd are having great games. They're taking away any kind of interior run, getting downhill in a hurry, and then being involved in the pass game where they're dropping in zone and then rallying to the throws underneath him. Second and eight. Extra pressure. Fired. It's incomplete. Olave cutting across over the middle and making third down and eight. Here's an example where you're still seeing Carr and his receivers, who are very gifted, just still working it out as far as the timing. Feels to me that Carr's expecting Olave to work a little bit more here instead of down. Look where the ball is thrown. A little bit more to the inside and got on him. But just slightly off on their timing. Good point. Third down and eight. Extra man comes. Carr. Can he get to the first down? No, he cannot. She got another fourth down coming up. Alulacan chased him out of bounds. And, of course, Carr doesn't want to see the field goal unit come in. He wants to go for it. But Allen has other ideas. So does the crowd. So, we've reached the two-minute warning. Movement when the ball hit the ground. After reviewing the play, the ball hit the ground. Therefore, an incomplete pass or foul. Well, the minute we start talking about it, we'll keep it at 14-6. Now we're back to 17-6 at 21-6. the possibility of. Meanwhile, so what you have here now is a fourth down. That was a third and two. So now the field goal group comes out. And you've got a 43-yard attempt coming up here for Brandon McManus. Several good years for him in Denver. Tenth here in the league. The lead operator, freezing set to 36 seconds. Three, six. owns a Super Bowl ring with the Broncos when he knocked off the Panthers back in Super Bowl 50 so a 43-yard attempt here Saints to get the ball we start the second half And that one is true to make it an 11-point game. Well, that fake punt set that up, and they're able to get those three points. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS, the big emphasis with that knee was to get the ball out quickly for Trevor Lawrence, something that he excels at anyway coming into tonight. second fastest in the league on his average of 2.39. You can see 2.26 seconds to throw. So he is back there getting the ball out. It's the second fastest average that he's had in his entire career. So he's seeing it, and they put together a great plan for him to be able to get that ball out and find in the matchups. Nobody's more frustrated with this stuff than Cam Jordan talking to him the other days about 10 behind Von Miller from Osaks by an active player. And he goes, man, what am I supposed to do? I'll never catch him. These quarterbacks are getting rid of the ball in, you know, two and a half seconds. What am I supposed to do? A big guy like that, all you can do is try to knock it down, right? He's so close. So the Saints, who have two timeouts, will get the ball to 25, down by 11 and 32 ticks on the clock. Think about the Jags. They're on the road, tough environment, minus two in the turnover margin. They've given the Saints these short fields, and yet here they are right now anyway, up 11, as the Saints' offensive struggles continue. Car 11-21 for just 100 yards. Look out. Loses the ball, but it is picked up. They maintain possession, almost a total disaster. Cameron Irving comes up with the loose ball to retain possession. The clock keeps rolling. The rhythm on the field is during a fourth down play. A member of the offense, other than the fumble, will cover the ball. The ball will be returned to the spot of the fumble. Well, you talk about trying to get to the pass rush here. Josh Allen gets there. Smoot ends up finishing it. So you get a quarterback to hold on to the ball. This is what can happen. And then they wind the clock again, and then Saints just say enough of this. We'll regroup. We'll try to talk it over at the half, find out what in the world is going on. 17-6 coming up after the break. State Farm halftime show. Stick around. Offensively as we start the second half. Jack's looking for their fourth straight win. Saints trying to get above. 500. Meanwhile, through the field we go, Kaylee. Coach, what have you identified as the biggest problem challenging your offense? Yeah, we've got to win situational football. Third down, red zone. We've got to be able to score points. We've got to be able to convert on third down. We've got to be able to kick a field goal. I mean, it's the little things like that that we've got to be able to do to give ourselves an opportunity to win a game. You were talking about trying to fix those same problems all week. What adjustments will we see in the second half? Yeah, look, it's all about execution. All right? And it's like, you know, R.C. said in the locker room to the offense. Let's go out there and make plays that we're capable of making. That's what it's about. All right, Kaylee with Dennis Allen. Meanwhile, coming back to make that catch, Olave. So Olave turned it to the outside. Carr put it right on the money. A gain of 15. Yeah, right on cue. There's the kind of execution that you like to see from Derek Carr to one of his top receivers, Chris Olave. And that time he got it out. He had a hitch and just delivered the football. In rhythm. That nickel spot. Nobody recognizes it, and he's able to affect that by just getting in there and kind of sneaking in late. Great job by Mike Caldwell. Just disguising to the last moment on that third down on the blitz. Rookie Blake Grupe out of Notre Dame. Free agent. Won the job in training camp. Had two misses last week. This is a 51-yard attempt here. And Grupe's kick is no good. So he's missed three out of his last five. They come up empty on the drive. 5.16 to go. It could be Kelsey and Kelsey how much you can save by bundling home and auto. Yeah? If you make the letters smaller. Home, auto, let's go. Come on, auto, let's get it. Put your jersey on. Bundling just another way to save with the personal price plan like a good neighbor state farmers there Probably getting in the night sky my man hand glad my phone Three years later City looks very good right now caught at the 40-yard line Christian Kirk and then the ball comes out It's still alive scramble for it Saints think they have it and they do Carl Granderson. There he is, number 96. Having a real good year. So Kirk makes the grab. And take a look again. Did he have control and possession? Sure looks like it. And Adebo, who's an outside corner, does a good job of just coming in and knocking that ball loose with his left arm. Fumble. Recovered by the defense. First down. It really looked like the Jags, Jag 2 Jags, had a chance to get on that. Kirk himself and another Jags player right there comes in, Ingram. But it slips through their hands and the Saints appear to be on top of that football. First and 10 play action. Taking a shot right over to Mario Davis. So on the move again. And that one comes to a screeching halt at the 41-yard line. Kirk shaking his head as he looks at the replay. Adibo forced it. Drop starts from the 41-yard line. Kamara runs into traffic. No gain, stopped just about at the line of scrimmage. Second and ten. There is a battle in the line of scrimmage. and right now the Saints have to be very thankful. Their offense is back out on the field. You and I were talking at the break. The way their game ended last week, a lot of criticism locally. They were anxious to get back on the field. Jacks go right down and score. They miss a field goal. Lawrence is back out there again, fortunate to get this turnover, see if they can do anything with it. Hill was on a wing that time. Passed short, passed caught. The lobby makes another catch. And it'll be third down and six from near midfield. Jaguar defense. Pete Carmichael, the offensive coordinator. Of course, he was on the Sean Payton staff, and so was Allen. So when they had to find a new coach, they stayed in-house, both with the head coach and the D.C. Jamal Williams is now in the game. He's back after missing the last few games with an injury. Over the middle, the pass is incomplete. Well, intended at that time for Shahid. So they pick up a, they get the takeaway, but can't do anything with it. Heck of a job here on third down. I'll tell you, he does a good job of playing deep safety. Andre Sisco kind of sinking and just reading the eyes of Derek Carr and waiting for anything that may come across the middle. We'll see how quickly he is able to drive down, anticipating that crossing route. So even if that ball's thrown on the money, he's able to be there. Maybe he would have come up with a pick. Lou Headley, originally from Australia, the 30-year-old rookie. Whoa, all kinds of action there. New Orleans comes up with the ball, but what's going to be the call here? Agnew was there, and Agnew is hurt. And Agnew apparently did not call for the fair catch. took a shot, lost the ball, and another turnover by the Jaguars. Now it looked like his own guy ran right into him. He's ready to receive this. Right there. Recovered by the kicking team. First down. Another break by New Orleans, this time with the special teams, jumping on beginning this drive after a turnover on down. I'm just thinking of one thing, Kirk. He's not very good below C-level. Yeah. Unfortunately, I called both those losses when he was in college. He was always in command, always in control, kind of like what we're seeing tonight, even with that knee hurting him. They put together a heck of a plan, Doug Peterson and Press Taylor. Ball's out quick. He can't help himself. We've seen a couple of those scrambles for big yards when it's been obvious. Second and ten. Shane shifting around on defense. Four-man rush. Batted in the air and incomplete. That's on Cam Jordan, who's in his 13th season with the bat third down intensive. Cam and his father, Steve, a great tight end with Minnesota. He played 13 years. We talked to Cam the other day and said, one more. He goes, one more, two more at least. Yeah, he's a little offended. He said, no, no, no, I got at least two. In great shape, great against the run, and still explosive player. Third and ten. Send an extra man, and it passes incomplete. So they put the pressure on. Lawrence could not connect. Granderson that time over the fine season. Put the heat on, and it's fourth down. They brought some pressure, and they played zone behind it, confused that offensive line up front. And these defensive ends, you know, if they have a chance to affect the game, it's on these third-down situations. And Carl Granderson that time wins on that left side against Cam Robinson, forced that ball out early. Logan Cook, his first punt of the night. Rashid Shahid is back to receive it. he can fly if he gets room but he has to call for the fair catch and holds it in at the 13 yard line 940s offensively they've run 24 plays for 90 yards this less than four yards per play and car is six out of 14 for 52 and missed a field goal punt on a three and out the one field goal they had they started it to Jagged 17-yard line and then a turnover on downs. But to get it back after the 3-0 out for Jacksonville. Now Carr throws over the middle, open, making the grab there. A lot of room to roam. A lot of room to roam for Kamara. Picks up the first down. So Alvin picks up 22 out to the 35. You know, anytime you see a quarterback in the National Football League executing well and playing with confidence, it's because he has answers. And right now when you watch Derek Carr, he's a guy that's learning a new offense, learning the timing of new receivers. Oftentimes when he's back there to throw, it looks like he's unsure. And I think these first four possessions, that's been pretty evident many of the throws that he has made. Stucked in the backfield right there. And then you've got a flag down there. That's Angelo Blackson. It's one thing to stop when the whistle blows. It's another to throw a wrestling move on him and get the penalty here. After the play, personal foul, unnecessary roughness. Defense number 90, a 15-yard penalty for Sal. He couldn't have played it any better with a swim technique off the line of scrimmage. And Doug Peterson said, hey, guys, let's use our head. He gets into the backfield, whistle's already blown, and his body slams Camaro to the ground. I don't know how he could state his case there. I think. No game. We got a first down. Ball up at the 47-yard line. This is Rashid Shaheed on the slot back around. Heater about three. Check in with Kaylee again. Guys, Dennis Allen said this week that communication has to be better on the Saints offense. But when I talked to Michael Thomas, he wanted to clarify that with me. He said, I don't want to point fingers. Number 70 is eligible. Number 70 is eligible. Maybe it's communication on one or two plays, but it's not a communications issue. Thomas said, we make a couple plays, and you're not talking about a communications issue. More so, he said, we just need to focus on making those plays. Right now they're focusing on getting something started here. Down by 11, second and six. Play action, pass caught. Kamara, nice tackle coming up there. ETN. Up to the 30-yard line. ETN also, like Lawrence, he went in the first round of the same draft, so Lawrence kind of knew he'd be the number one pick. And, you know, they're celebrating at the house and everything. The next thing you know, man, I got my college teammates coming with me. He was excited. Imagine being the first pick, and you met all the hoopla and all the craziness and, you know, the draft after that. You kind of, even though you're thinking about your teammates, it's just crazy. And then he finds out, oh, by the way, Etienne's coming with you. He's coming with him. He's tired out. Hurt his foot in his first, in his rookie year, so he didn't play at all. Had a good year last year, a real good year. Tank Bixby is in the game now. The rookie will take the ball up to about the 32. They picked him in the third round out of Auburn. Final minute of the quarter. It's third down and two. He is a good-looking back. And, of course, just being a rookie, they've eased him in. Etienne has carried the load throughout, not only catching the ball, but running inside and outside. But I think the more and more the Jacks see and trust with Tank Bixby, the more he can be, as this season wears on, a great complement to what Etienne can be. He's the go-to guy. Already two turnovers, but it resulted in only one field goal and one missed field goal attempt. Third and three. Lawrence bouncing around. That's caught up at the 40-yard line. Kirk makes the catch there. That's a first down, and that takes us. We're going to be fine. Just a little communication on the front return. It got loud in here. He didn't hear the getaway call that we call. And then Christian just, you know, he's got to be smart there in that situation, getting off the ground. You know, they're going to knock the ball out. They did a great job of doing that. Good ball. As we're back, a little trickery here as Agnew winds up making the catch. So they have Kirk going one way. Agnew coming to the near side. A little razzle-dazzle. And an eight-yard gain here for all that. I so impressed with Doug Peterson just what he done what he brought to this franchise And let face it there was a little bit of a turmoil period there when he came in And not just the success on the field what they doing but just the culture and the way it a players team He's doing a heck of a job. Tremendous. Got him to the playoffs last year, raced the 27-0 deficit to the Chargers. Went to Kansas City the next week and took them to the wire as they pick up a first down here on a gain of a couple by ETN. So Doug, of course, has that Super Bowl ring, coaching the Eagles to their only Super Bowl championship back in the 17 season. Yeah, and you know, when you've won that Super Bowl, and especially in recent years, you stand in front of that team right away, you catch their attention, and they want to follow you. They trust what you have to say, and it's definitely worked out for them. At the 48-yard line. Vicki stays in the block, almost gets run over him, but does the job. And here goes Lawrence again, down the sideline and out of bounds. So, once again, instinctive as Doug Peterson was telling Cayley. And meanwhile, he has now carried the ball twice to 34 yards. Yeah, so much for that. Like he just told Cayley, the instincts do take over. And he did tell us, you know, as he's testing it out throughout this week, Defense number four. Five-yard penalty will be out of the end of play for Stout. As he was testing it this week, he said running straight doesn't bother him. And the two scrambles we've seen, it's not the lateral movement. They blitz. He sees a hole. He takes off. I mean, his knee can handle that without a lot of stress or pain on it. And then he does a smart thing and gets out of bounds. I'm going to tell you, at his size, 6'5", covers a lot of ground. Second longest run of his career. 26 yards. Penalty was on Taylor. Of course, it was declined. First down from the 17-yard line. Little flip here. ETN. ETN takes it to the end zone. Touchdown. Man, oh man. How quickly do they get in here? And, of course, the crowd, they're letting the Saints know it. 17 yards. He has, Etienne now has five touchdowns in his last three appearances. You get motion here from Christian Kirk, this jet sweep look. He's going to set up to the left, but watch the defense respond to 13. And this little fake here to go around, and then they're able to flip it to Etienne to give him a corner. Browner from a couple years ago has been the guy. And now the last couple weeks have tried to find some new answers. Today it's Pete. He's just trying to hold up on an island there against Blackson. Just pulls him down by the front of that jersey. Remember we talked about that they self-destructed with penalties and sacks and things to get behind the sticks. And now here they are after that holding call. Moving the ball pretty well. and now the holding call takes him back to second and 20. Put one more second back on the clock and what that's worth. Ninth play of the drive, started back at the wrong 25-yard line. Second and 20. To the outside and nobody's home. I mean, nobody. Well, the fact he's not under pressure, Terry is telling me that there will not be any intentional grounding. But this drive is really a microcosm of their season. Moving the ball, moving the ball, moving the ball. All of a sudden, a holding call in plus territory. Second and 20. Follow it up with a pass to nobody out in the flat. And now you're third and 20. Run into a stone wall. Carr chased. Caught inside the 30s. So at least they set up a field goal here. Moreau making the catch. Jenkins is there with Herndon. So it'll be fourth and ten. And they'll try to make it a one-possession game again. You're right. I mean, it's so true. So microcosm. Move it, move it, stop. Yeah. And there's the frustration again from Derek Carr. It makes me wonder on that second 20 when it appeared to throw it to nobody. Was that a hot or a side adjust that one of the receivers didn't check to with that blitz? They got to par. The rookie, Blake Groupie, 42 yards away. Puts that one through. I'll take Tyreek Hill. Oh, yeah, but of course. Imagine Tyreek Hill in flag football. That's against the rules, right? It's got to be an international rule to Tyreek Hill. This is what I think created the frustration. You get a blitz here. He's trying to side it, and he wants to try to hot the throw out here to Kamara, and Kamara just continues downfield, didn't even see the blitz, and then he realized what just happened. He said, man, that one's on me. In fact, he went over to the sideline and talked to Derek Carr. That was on second and 20 before the completion on third down. And you can see he even went over to him and talked to him. Again, it's another example of these guys just trying to work out the kinks in his offense. Flag throwing him before the snap. Play blown dead. We've seen Derek Carr more animated and frustrated in the last two weeks than we've seen in a long time when he was with the Raiders. Very much so. False start. Offense. Five-yard penalty. Still first down. Well, he got very frustrated toward the end of last year in Las Vegas because he knew it was over. They benched him for the final two games. They knew he was on his way out. So he winds up going back with Dennis Allen, with whom he started as a rookie back in 14 when Allen coached the first four games in open. Yep, that's right. So it's first and 15 now. Quick throw to the outside. and about a four-yard pickup. Calvin Ridley. Ridley was with Atlanta and he was out all of last year because he was in a gambling situation. And he talked about it very openly, wrote a thing in the Athletes Journal about it, about depression and gambling. He made a terrible mistake. I traded it to Jacksonville, and here he is. He's had a couple big games, too. I think he's just kind of finding his role with an offense that has a lot of firepower. When Zay Jones comes back, Evan Ingram and Ridley, Christian Kirk, Etienne, I mean, they're loaded. Yeah, he had a big day opening day. He did Ridley with eight catches against Indianapolis. He's caught up at the 28-yard line by Tim Jones, who was the recipient on that fake punt earlier. Lattimore makes the stop here at third down. Just a thought here. As bad as this has been for the Saints offense, the Jags got to be careful letting them hang around. One thing Doug Peterson told us is he's trying to teach his team how to be a winner, how to handle success. But when you have a team that's not playing well, you need to bury them, right? Bury an inferior team, and they've not been able to do that yet tonight. Not a rule. Darius Williams, again, played with the Rams, came over here as that Super Bowl ring and their victory over Cincinnati back after the 21 season. You know, what's amazing about Darius Williams, there's Kamara up to that hit, off to the sideline. What's amazing about Darius Williams is that he's a guy that really has been more of a slot corner. They moved him late last year out to the outside. He's found a home and plays with good vision on the perimeter of this defense. Kamara on the sideline for the moment. Jamal Williams is back in. Third down and three. Carr throws, batted away again. Lovie looks for a flag. There is none. Trey Herndon is there, and it's fourth down. Well, on third down, they're not feeling threatened downfield, so Herndon just kind of settles at the top of the route and expects this ball to be coming out. Alave has the ability to go by you, but there's the first down marker. Really good job of just the situational awareness by your slot corner. Herndon just being smart, doesn't interfere, and knocks the ball away. at least putt fair catch called for on the move at the 18 yard line pulled in by Agnew with 7-17 remaining in the first half 14-3 Jaguars play last year when he got to the team on a Tuesday and led them to that fantastic dramatic drive at the end of the game to beat the Raiders On the plane, reading the offense, trying to learn Sean McVay's system as best he could. Showed up with a wristband and ended up finding a way to win. What a night. Now he's the man in Tampa. They're off to a decent start. We'll see him next week in Buffalo on Thursday night. Swing pass here. Nice little move to the inside. ETN picks up about eight. So the Jaguars on their way. They hope to have forced through. But, you know, we mentioned at the start, the Saints seen some good, seen some bad, everything in between. So far, they have to figure out a way to get it together, at least offensively. No, I think they're hoping, the reason they punt here, they try to pin Trevor Lawrence and the Jags deep and rely on their defense before the half here, get the ball back. But their offense, it's kind of, it's almost like they're stuck in mud. You know, they're just not quite able to get this thing going. A lot of individual ability, just not quite clicking yet. Give it to Bigsby. Of course, the crowd gets impatient because they had a decade and a half of Sean Payton and Drew Brees. Yeah. They're not used to seeing this. No. And there was many years of this offense being looked at as one of the best in the NFL. And Drew Brees really spoiled him. Had a lot of talent around to work with Drew. It's great to see him here tonight. But, yeah, it's an offense or a town that's used to offensive production putting big points on the board. Third and three. Three receivers to the left. They go that way. Reaching for it. Does he make the grab along the sideline? He's Agnew. And he's out of bounds. So fourth down. he was able to with this softer coverage from Lattimore on third down he trusts his instincts as a corner so much that he thinks he can drive on the ball the ball is just thrown Agnew just cannot make a play on it incomplete, fourth down in the punt Logan Cook another fair catch call for Action there. Flag is thrown. So you had Shahid calling for the fair catch. You had Antonio Johnson running into him. So you know what that penalty is going to be. And we'll hear from Land to Clark in a moment. What kinds of stuff going on in these fair caches tonight? You know, the late fair catch doesn't impact this at all. Johnson just runs right into him. It's a foul. Interferes with the opportunity to catch a kick. Kicking team number 26. A 15-yard penalty for Sal. Well, the idea to punt that ball away on fourth and three in plus territory works out. The defense does their job. And now after that penalty, they're going to be starting this next possession in plus territory. So, yeah, he had a 35-yard punt with a 20 net at the end of the day after the pedal. Loaches, as usual, it's always Mardi Gras time down here. New Year's Eve, take your pick. In the Superdome, meanwhile, New Orleans won the toss. They have deferred, and so Jacksonville will get it. One of the top runback men in the lead, Jamal Agnew, is back there. But four out of five kickoffs this year have resulted in touchbacks. And this one does too. So out come the Jaguars. Lawrence not really doing any practicing this week, just rehabbing. Seven touchdowns, four of them in the two games against Indianapolis. He's also rushed 33 times for 147. Don't expect him to run too much tonight from the 25-yard line. His college mate, there's the brace on the left knee. ETN, they're running back in the backfield. Start with motion, give it to ETN, and he gets stuck at the line of scrimmage. Get at the 25-yard line to Mario Davis, who was a little shaky this week. Wondering about whether he would play tonight, but there he is making the first tackle of the game. One thing about Trevor Lawrence and that knee, talking to Press Taylor, their offensive coordinator and play caller, They're going to feel things out early, expect a lot of quick passes, not a lot of mobility from Big 16, even though that's a big part of his game. Quick passes in the run game are critical tonight early for the Jaguars. Yeah, don't sit in the pocket too much. This time he gets rid of it in a hurry, and it's caught. Nice leaping grabs there. It's made by Evan Ingram. The tight end holding onto it and picks up the first down of the night. Yeah, that's what you're going to see. He's the second fastest in the entire league at getting the ball out at 2.39. And right away, he recognizes a good cushion with Ingram against Marcus May and takes it. Puts that out early. Because of that, he's able to give Ingram that chance. And let's stay away from that left knee now. You see a big defender there. Granderson goes down low. But all Jaguars fans and NFL fans love to see Trevor Lawrence healthy tonight. Jaguars have three tight ends in this set. Off play action now. A little pass taken here by ET. And off he goes into Saints territory to the 39-yard line. You know, he's a guy. He doesn't get a lot of publicity, a lot of acclaim. But, man, oh, man, I tell you, he is one of the best backs in the league right now. Yeah, he really is. And they're one of the best screen teams in the league. Watch Brandon Sheriff right here. Just timed this up perfectly. Looked like the Saints might have this thing sniffed out. But look at 68. Bang, right there. Takes out Pete Warner. And then you get ETN in space. He's as good as anybody when he's got a little bit of room to work with, and he accelerates. Probably his greatest attribute, the balance and the acceleration upfield. Again, he has more carries and more touches over carries plus receptions, the touches, than anybody in the league right now. Malcolm Roach making the tackle. They're getting a four second down at six. Talking this week with you about ETN, I said one of the big things when these two were teammates, Lawrence and ETN in college, I said everybody wanted to talk about Trevor Lawrence for obvious reasons. He's a quarterback and a Heisman candidate. But if you really watch Clemson, ETN had as much to do with that success. And now here they are again in Jacksonville in much of the same. Comes out for this play. Tank Dixby is the running back, but they set him wide to the left, a rookie out of Auburn. So they go empty here. And Lawrence is going to take off and slides to a hole at the 25-yard line. And the whole bench holding their breath. And you and I were kidding with him with Kaylee the other night on our Zoom. We talked to him. He said, I'm not going to scramble. I'm not going to run. I said, what happens when your instincts take over? He kind of smiled. He was like, I'm going to try not to. Well, here's an example. It opened up in that empty set. He saw the numbers, and he couldn't help himself. Took the first down. Meanwhile, the injured Saint right now, timeout here, is Elante Taylor. Plays in the slot. Boy, his numbers are great in terms of defending out of the slot. here, but here he is at least for the moment having to come out of the game. He was actually there to try to make a tackle on Trevor Lawrence and dove and just ended up going down. So Ugo Amati will come in to take his place. Number zero comes in from number one. Watch here. He comes off from the right side. There he is diving. And it kind of lands awkwardly. I don't think the Saints thought Trevor Lawrence was much of a threat tonight either. They were spread all over the field. Nobody was left there. And linebacker, the Mario Davis and Pete Warner were outside expecting a quick throw. Now the rookie, Bigsby, comes into the backfield. Top of this. That's the ball. Campbell runs right into him. So two turnovers in the first one or so minutes of the game. 7-0. Jack New's okay. Trots off under his own power. Terry, we're going to take a look at this. Terry McCauley is repped. Three Super Bowls. Is this a fair catch signal or not? It is. It's borderline invalid, but it is a signal. But it has no effect on the play because the teammate of the receiving team player is actively engaged. It's all on him. And that was the case there. Clearly, as they begin this very short drive from the red zone, where they carry here for Jamal Williams, who last year was with Detroit. And Williams this year, he gained over 1,000 yards with Detroit. But, you know, there's such a premium, or not a premium, on running backs in this league. They said, you're out, we'll bring other guys in, like David Montgomery. He comes down here to back up Kamara. Second and six. Pass here. Kamara stays in bounds. Nice move. First and goal. Takes it down to the six-yard line where Devin Lloyd makes the tackle. This is a team over the years of Drew Brees, known for their screen game, has not been working well this year. Good to see them call it at the right time and pick up first down yardage. The red zone has been a disaster in their last couple losses, of course, last week. They had possessions that ended at Houston's 27, 11, 15, and 24. That's their last four possessions. Only came away with three points. So even in a short week, a big emphasis in finishing drives. Self-immolation. Short game, one or two yards here. Kamara, who missed the first three games, she was suspended. the personal conduct policy. Got into a bad brawl in Las Vegas last year and had to sit out the first three games. Trevor Penning comes into the game, so they're going to go jumbo here to get some more offensive linemen in. He's lined up on the right side. Second down and goal. Carr, good protection. And then finally he just has to throw it as it's caught in the back of the end zone. No. Shahid was able to get there, but could not stay inbound. So for a moment it looked like Carr was going to throw it away, but there is Shahid. Yeah, what an effort, right? He climbed the ladder, gets one, and then he's out. One foot down. The play was designed. And they go jumbo, making the Jaguars' defense think, oh, they're going to go power. They're going to run the football. Instead, they try to get Alave isolated one-on-one off to the left, unable to get it to him. He actually went down and was covered pretty well. Good job by Shahid trying to keep the play alive, but just a one foot down. Third and goal. Running back is Williams. He stays in the block. The pass is batted away in the end zone. And the Bluebirds are out again. And that's Buster Brown, given first name as Monteric, batting it away. Intended for Michael Thomas. So, again, they can't get in when they get down deep. And this is who you want to go to. Michael Thomas at 6-3 against the backup corner in for Campbell, as you said, Alan. You know what? He does a good job of it. You can tell, even though he's been getting a lot of game reps, he's been getting a lot of practice reps. Head turned around, anticipating that fade. The ball needed to be thrown up higher to get a chance to get it to the taller receiver. Blake Groupie who missed the earlier one this one the chip shot and he bangs it through a little mock cheer here a minute and 26 remaining in the first quarter it's Jacksonville 7 and the see Agnew is back there and they've taken that whack on the last attempted punt return the groupie to put it in the air the free agent from Notre Dame and Agnew will let it down through the end zone if you go back to the Jags first possession it was really everything you'd want to see and the big question is how is Trevor Lawrence in that knee going to hold up and that first drive is any indication he looked great even here a scramble to pick up a first down was able to get down before he took any contact and delivering the football All six different Jags touched the ball in that drive and could not have been any better for Prest Taylor, the play caller, and Trevor Lawrence. Of course, they came right back and hit another one, only to have Christian Kirk fumble on that first play of the second possession. Nothing. Kamara right there. Alvin Kamara tonight on the ground. Jacksonville doing a great job defending the run. That's eight carries, nine total yards. Yeah, and what they're doing is the defensive line is doing a great job of occupying these offensive linemen. It's an offensive line that hasn't spent a lot of time playing together. I'm sure the communication as there's movement up front has been affected, but they're freeing up those linebackers to come down and just completely take away the threat of this run game. I'm on guard! I'm on guard! I'm on guard! I'm on guard! Why's that? Second and nine, he's chased, gets it away, catches May to the 45. Foster Moreau, the tight end, tackled by Herndon. So third down and four for the Saints. When they have brought pressure, they have disguised it very well, and they've been able to come free. This time, he doesn't come up with a sack, but just by disguising it, putting pressure on the quarterback, he just is able to check it down there to Moreau. And a good job by Carr being able to improvise here, at least to get some positive yards. Carr caught, but a little short of the first down. Receives to Heath, and now at the 48-yard line, again, decision time, fourth and one, two minutes in to the third quarter. One of nine now on third downs, and this is about a half a yard. all across the league. We always see that sneak. See if Derek Carr is going to be involved in that. Better athlete than I think he realized. One for two on fourth down. Going for it. And they get it. And they get a lot more in Kamara. It's in the 35-yard line. Needed one. And Alvin gets 17. Max Garcia pulls around, leads this, and does a nice job. Watch 73 come out and get a kickout block right here. Just kind of opens it up. Left side collapses down, and there you go. In a short yardage defense, you hit through that first initial surge, and Kamara has a lot of room finally to get out and go. Took Josh Allen out of the play on that block. Watch it! Wide open to Lave, but he gets about six where the tackle is made along the sideline there. Second down. Go back to the defensive plan by Mike Caldwell. You're going up against an offense that's struggling for consistency. You want to make them drive the length of the field to earn it. And that's what he's doing, sitting back off it and forcing that ball to be thrown underneath Ethan trying to rally to the football. Now Carr comes out of the game here. That means, of course, Cason Hill comes in. Number seven, flanked by Jamal Williams. Keeps it. Hill bulls his way for a first down. So Hill comes in again for that change of pace. Six to the 23. Back comes Carr. Yeah, you know what's coming, right? I mean, you know when he comes in, chances are he's going to hold on to this football, and they're in position there, and then bang. I mean, you talk about a way to try to ignite an offense. Runs like this, whether it's the running back or especially a quarterback, running over top of defenders and picking up first downs. What a valuable asset. Francisco with him at the end of that play, ball to the 23-yard line. looking for Shaheen instead there's nothing there throws it into the ground it's incomplete that time it was Cisco coming in and forcing the throw second and ten this is just good awareness how many times have we seen this answer you know they're trying to set up a screen here and I think they tipped their hand too early the defense gets out there and is almost waiting for it. You see Devin Lloyd's eye. Here you throw it. Throw it. I'll catch it. Yeah, you've got two of them a little time as well. Carr over the middle. Incomplete contestant flag down to the 32-yard line. Then from Moreau. Covered by Lloyd. Here's Land Clark. Holding. Offense number 75. Ten-yard penalty. Second down. Andrews Peet. Their number one pick back in 2015 in his ninth season. And they're trying to figure out that left tackle spot. Trevor Penning, the first. New Orleans on this Thursday night. Jaguars up by 11. Point game on the Saints here with a 35-yard field goal attempt by Blake Grupe. Made one, missed one. Hits that one down the middle. So, it is 14-6. 157. We can tell you some TNF talk. Around the league, what's going on? No team has started 6-0 for the first time since 2017, with the Eagles and the Niners both losing on Sunday. How about the Lions? First time since 93. best record in the NFL this late into the season. Everything going swimmingly in the Motor City. And the Dolphins are the second team in NFL history. 15 rushing TDs, 15 passing TDs for six games. The first team to do it, the 1958 Baltimore Colts, who beat the Giants in maybe one of the great games ever played. The first ever overtime game beat the Giants in the championship game. What a game with Miami and Philly this week. Should be a lot of fun to see how those two teams collide. 14-6, the Jaguars on top. And start from the 25. Down we go to Kayla. Al, thanks, rookie. First-round pick, Brian Brazillas. I'm Jaguars begin this drive with a pass to the outside. That's very close to a first down Kirk making the catch there. Taylor knocks him out of bounds at that spot and up for the first. Yeah, with all three timeouts left and with the ability of Trevor Lawrence and the weapons he has around them and the fact the Saints get the ball to start the second half. They're obviously going to turn it up here and try to put points up on the board. quickly to the outside and that's another first down so two passes, two first downs Ingram the tight end making that grab he scored three tonight you look at him, he is a tight end but technically with Zay Jones out, what a valuable commodity he is to have where you can flex him out. He's really a bigger wide receiver when you watch him run his route. 6'3", 240 pounds. And right now until Zay Jones gets back, he's playing as much receiver as he is tied in. Got a flag here. false start offense number 17 5 yard penalty, still first half it's on Engler Doug Peterson has to be pretty excited with what he's seen from his offense in his first half, so many questions about Trevor Lawrence, the knee, how would he hold up, would he play, would C.J. Beathard have to go, went out to the pregame warm up to see how he'd feel wearing the brace first time in his entire career, high school, college, or pros, and executing pretty well here in his first half. Among other things, he's a leading rusher in the game. 35 yards, that pass is caught. You know, what's interesting, Kirk, is that this team is only going to play one game in the next 23 days. They have the mini-bye coming up, go to Pittsburgh, then they've got the real bye. So, you know, they could have looked at this and said, you know, let's just let him rest. Yeah, and I think if he would have had any kind of feeling in the pregame that would have made them think, you know what, let's let him rest. I think all indications were he feels good, let's turn him loose. Second and four. And that incomplete BTN the intended receiver third and four Chased by another Clemsonite. Yeah, that's right. Good buddies. They're talking in the pregame. You just heard the story about Brian. He'll get, at least for that play, you see he turned his head real quick to look back at Trevor Lawrence. Watch him look like I got you on that one. Indeed. Third and four. Lawrence. So ETN make it six. Six scampers to the end zone. Two tonight. Two in each of the last three games. That's the point will be next. The board occupies the defense. They start to move, and then you get them to the corner. Look how fast. You're talking about up over 20 miles an hour. The acceleration. And once you take one step as an aggressive defense in the wrong direction, and number one's going the other way, it's going to be awfully tough to catch up to him. Two or more TDs, three straight games. First in franchise history. Touchback. Here we go to Kaylee. Christian Kirk told me one of the things that impresses him most about Travis Etienne is his contact balance. Kirk said you can't just hit him low or high. You have to wrap him up, which Kirk told me is crazy because at 5'10", 215, Etienne is not the biggest player in the world. He's just a natural, Kirk said. And remember how Trevor Lawrence said it surprises people how durable Etienne is as he bounces off defenders and goes from 0 to 100 in a second or 20 miles per hour as we just saw. Lawrence said that's what makes him so much fun to watch. Yeah, he's, again, we mentioned before, misses entire rookie season foot injury. Really good year last year and having a terrific start to 2023. Car throws, it's caught up at the 30-yard line. Start this drive with a five-yard game. Rasheed Shahid making the catch second year man out of Weber State, who's as fast as probably anybody in the league. Yeah, how about the Saints? You know, they've had a tough week after that loss and the way they lost to Houston. and they get this game started back at home. Want to keep the crowd engaged. They get two turnovers right away. Only able to turn them into three points, and now they're down 14-3. Carr on the second and five. Open man. That's caught up at the 47-yard line. Gets it to Foster Moreau. The tight end. Jawan Johnson, who's their number one tight end, inactive tonight. So Moreau is the man. Good job of, you see 12 there, Olave takes the corner with him, gave him a nice throwing lane. The ball had to get out early, which he does a good job of anticipating there before Andre Sisco and, in that time, Rashawn Jenkins could come over and make a play. Jamal Williams to the 48-yard line. He goes, brought him, of course, with Kamara having the three-game suspension and also to take a little of the workload away from Alvin. But then he got hurt. Williams did, but healthy and back after missing weeks three through five. All these years with Kamara, they've always had that thumper, that thunder and lightning type of backfield. So it's good to see Williams back and healthy. Second and six. Over the right side here, Williams again. Devin Lloyd stops him at the 45-yard line where it'll be third down and three for the Saints. A line shift here. They brought in about four or five different players here for this third down play. Thomas wide left. Olavi is in the slot. Kasem Hill is in there. 23-25. Lock, lock. 23-25. Lock, lock. Play clock at three. Carr. Fires. Batted away at the last moment. Trying to get it to Thomas. And that's Darius Williams. Who won a Super Bowl with the Rams two years ago. Comes over here. Bats it away fourth down. Third down and three. You'd think you might see a crosser here. But instead, after a lot of communication at the line of scrimmage, a very low percentage route down the field to Thomas. Great technique by Williams. For the moment, they line up to go for it on fourth down. And they're going for it. And Carr throws, and that's incomplete. That's batted away. Got a flag down on the play. Devin Lloyd got his hand on it. The indication is the penalty is against the Saints. You've got Aluakon putting the pressure on. Pass interference. Offense number 13. A penalty is defined. James Averson. First down. On Thomas, and that's going to give him the ball near midfield. 10-43 to the half. It's been all Jaguars at this point. They lead 14-3, and they get the ball back. Tonight. And right now he has a first and ten. Fake to him. Gets it away. Passes incomplete. Intended for Evan Ingram again. Second down and ten. So Lawrence, the number one overall pick in the 21 draft. Doug Peterson in his second season. And boy, what a difference that made. Urban Meyer was the coach in that 21 season. He'll fade it. Lasted less than half the year. Darryl Bevel took over. Lawrence all kinds of pains and they were so bad that year they have the number one choice the next year too and you and I had him late last year when he was playing as well as really any quarterback in the league those last 8 or 9 weeks swings it out here and a little extra effort there by Ingram tackled by Lattimore setting up a 3rd down and 7 great job by Lattimore known for his ability to cover and they play a ton of man to man it's great to see him healthy after the lacerated kidney and he kept him out of most of the 22 season. Shows you he can get physical. Big emphasis this week for Joe Woods and Dennis Allen setting the edge to this defense. Jacksonville does a great job of stretching you horizontally. Woods is the defensive coordinator, but Allen's pedigree is defense. He calls the defense. Third down and seven. In the pocket, fires caught, And that's another first down. So moving down the field, Christian Kirk came over last year from the Arizona Cardinals, and that's four first downs on this drive, eight plays, 60 yards. He's got eight Saint defenders up at the line of scrimmage, mugging and then dropping, and a good job of Trevor Lawrence being able to get. The idea is to get the ball out quickly. They think that Christian Kirk could have a huge night tonight from that slot position. Great execution there. Good awareness where he needed to go for the first down. Come out of the pistol this time. Take the ETN. And a little flip here. And inside the five goes Jamal Agnew. Their runback specialist. Bring him in from time to time. And he takes it down to a first and goal situation from the two-yard line. Now, it's got to be an alert. When 39 comes into the game, you just know chances are get ready. They're going to try to get the ball in his hands, and a lot of times it's a jet sweep or a reverse like this. Right now, it just feels like Press Taylor on this opening script, just a step ahead of the Saints. With a quarterback, we all wondered how would he hold up. Great play calling so far. Saints have not allowed an opening drive TD in 18 games and into the end zone for the first time in a year. Touchdown against them. Travis Etienne takes it into the end zone. So that took only 5-16. Crowd not thrilled. They go 10 plays, 75 yards. A first and goal from the two counts is a first down. They picked up six first downs on that drive. Yeah, heck of a drive. Great way to start the game on the road. And this offensive line, you know, they've had some issues themselves with some injuries. They're really starting to gel. And I think this is a night for them with Cam Robinson missing his first four games. Walker Little's been out. So they've been moving some people in and out. But that drive was a great start for them. Brandon McManus, the longtime Bronco. with the extra point. So 944 left in the quarter. Great drive by the Jaguars to take the early 7-0 lead in New Orleans. And Derek Carr will take his team out to the 25-yard line. Derek Carr, nine years with the Raiders. This season, five TDs, three picks. They won their first two games. Had a 17-0 lead in game three against Green Bay and lost. So now they've lost three out of four. Self-destructed pretty much last week in Houston. Trying to get it back together here. Down seven to nothing. Kamara's the running back. Carr looks one way, then the other, and then shoots it over the middle, and it's dropped by Alvin Kamara. On their first play from scrimmage, it'll be second down and ten. Coming off the game and the way it ended against Houston, I think a big thing for Derek Carr, and we're really witnessing right before our eyes, is there's an example right there. Just the timing and the rhythm of this offense. You've got great individual players that are trying to figure things out right before our eyes, and we'll see how they do it tonight. In the middle. A little extra move there after Kamara had the initial contact, about four yards past the line of scrimmage, turns it into a six-yard game, third down and four. One of the things that often people don't maybe like to hear, You don't want to make excuses, but each week you and I travel around the league, and we kind of the same theme about offensive linemen banged up, and it's a patchwork group this week on a short week. I don't know if that's ever been more evident than New Orleans tonight. Turn and six. ETN inside. Handoff. Close, but a little bit short. Pete Werner makes the tackle. Going to be fourth and inches. So does Peterson want to gamble? Does it look like it right now? No. It's one of those looks of, I tell you, if he had a healthy 16, he probably sneaks it and gets it. But without that is an option. Then again with the fake punt last time, I'm sure. Heads are on a swivel. Lattimore's lined up now on that left side. Yeah, not a moment for the tush push either with the guy with the sprained knee. Here's Logan Cook. No fake this time. Booming kick. And beautiful. Out of bounds at the 15-yard line. So, that is a 53-yard boot with no return. No sender, no return. It's been the secondary. This Jaguars defense, they've sat back. They mixed up some looks, but they are playing the football well. In fact, you know, one thing that you've got to really appreciate is how they are getting their heads turned around and locating the football in position to knock the ball away, make it that much tougher on Carr in this offense to find their rhythm. Start from the 13 here. Running back is Jamal Williams. He gets it and gets nothing. It's stuffed there. But Dukasi, right in the middle, number 94 makes the stop. So this is why it's tough, tough to run. You know, you'd love to be able to run the football to take some of the pressure off this offensive line, but look what you're dealing with. You've got the outside linebackers walked up. Everybody's covered, and when everybody's covered, you get those linebackers flying downhill, and they're just running into a wall. Carr throws. Nope. No good there. Tending for Michael Thomas, who at least is healthy this year, if nothing else. The guy who's played a total of ten games in the three prior seasons. Boy, when you take away that running game, it's not a threat. You make them one-dimensional. Puts everything on the shoulders of Carr and an offensive line that's doing their best to handle the pressure and keep him clean. Carr, third and ten, steps up, fires, batted, picked. Oluokon comes up with the interception off the deflection, and Oluokon will take the ball close to the goal line. They are celebrating as if he is in there, and the official says he is. For the moment, touchdown. Another batted ball. Yep. They've been forcing Carr to be patient, to be patient, check it down, check it down, and he has. And this time on third and ten, instead of checking it down, he forces one. And they force him to be impatient here on this third down. Right there, he could have checked it down and would not have gotten the first down, but it would have avoided the turnover. He takes a chance. Tight coverage again. Another contested coverage here by Darius Williams, 31, and Lewa Khan is able to get to the corner and get the touchdown for the Jags. Great defense tonight all around from Jacksonville. So the man who's led the league in tackles each of the last two seasons came over last year from Atlanta, gets the first touchdown of his career. And the extra point is good off the foot of Brandon McManus. And with 6.47 to go in an exasperated Superdome, it's 24-9. In which Jacksonville is located. And he is here tonight. To Kaylee. Al, plays like that pick six are exactly why the Jaguars C4A Aluokan is the clear leader of this defense. Josh Allen told me the passion, energy, and fire Aluokan plays with is unbelievable. And when he speaks, Allen said, I give him nothing but eye contact because that's the respect he's earned from my eyes. I'll tell you what, we had him at a meeting last year. It's one of the most interesting, pleasurable meetings we've had with a guy. Went to Yale. Parents are from Nigeria. Terrific guy. Fascinating guy. And this is Thomas trying to get free. And he does for a contact there. Pass is ruled incomplete. Everybody wants in the stadium a flag. You've got Buster Brown there with Chris Olave. All legal. And the Jags begin to celebrate. But with the game on the line, you go to your top receiver against a backup corner who is in for Tyson Campbell, who has held his own tonight, and he does it again. Let's give him a lot of credit. Second year out of Arkansas. Doesn't give Alave any room, a little wiggle. Tries to get around him and never has a chance. Brown played that ball perfectly, almost came up with an interception. He put it up where he thought Alave might be able to work around him on that fade. But too good a coverage from Buster Brown. And if only that one would have found its rightful place in the arms of Moreau. Well, they can go to victory for me. The Saints have a couple of timeouts, but they don't have the third one, so cannot force a punt. That kind of a night for the Saints. Fight back. Moreau knows it was off his fingertips. The Saints will at least take a timeout. Hope for some sort of a miracle, fumble, or whatever. Moreau will have more opportunities, but obviously you feel like you let your team down when it's an opportunity like that. But there's lots of plays. It's not just one play. It's easy to look at that one play. But if you're a Saints fan, You've got to be proud of the way this team battled at 24-9. It looked like nothing was going right. Same old, same old inconsistency. What's wrong? Why can't they figure this out? And then just like that, they were able to get right back in the game and tie it up and look like they had a shot to maybe win it here late. Saints will take another timeout, but just one more kneel down will end it. Well, for New Orleans, you look at their upcoming schedule. at Indianapolis. You've got no Richardson. He's gone for the season. Chicago comes here. They go to Minnesota. They go to Atlanta. So, not the toughest road. Meanwhile, Jacksonville only has one game over the next three weeks. Yeah, they go to Pittsburgh. They have the bye, and then they have the 49ers. Exactly. They won four in a row. They're in first place in their division. One game in the next 23 days. Peterson and Allen with the handshake at midfield. And the Jaguars, 5-2 record is their best start in 16 seasons. Turned out to be quite a game if it was 24-9 at one point. So, Saints fought from behind, tied it up. And then Christian Kirk gets free here. They targeted him six times tonight. He caught six for 90 yards. And the game-winning score. Off the fingertips of Moreau. and the Saints come that close to maybe sending it in overtime or even going for the two-pointer and the win. Don't go anywhere. Carissa and the gang wrapping it up. The man who's down, that's the injury timeout here. Drive is consumed almost five minutes. We talked about that defense and we were showing you Mike Caldwell before, so he's done a great job. 5-yard line. Hill takes the snap. Not this time. He's stopped. There's Aluakon again in on that tackle. So third and three. So impressive the way he's able to get off that block and make that tackle against Taysom Hill. Red zone their last two games where they've lost football games. They've been 0-5 down in the red zone tonight. They've had a couple opportunities, no touchdowns. So it has been a problem throughout the year, and especially noticeable last week in their loss to Houston. Well, there's Carr on the sideline, so they leave Hill in the game. He takes it, and Hill, looking for that first down, should have it. Wow. So Hill on back-to-back plays Sets up a first and goal He's calling Saunders the big defensive tackle right here And they do enough of a job They just try to make it a foot race And he's able just to get to the corner there Outran Wingard there to get to the corner for the first down Nothing like a 325-pound defensive tackle leading the way for you first and goal car fires batted incomplete another batted ball to flag Josh Allen I think certainly in the middle of that flag thrown in his direction Foster Moreau the intended receiver land Clark is the referee to give us the call. Personal foul. Unnecessary reference. Defense number two. That penalty will be in fourth half the distance of the goal. Pulling that one on Rayshon Jenkins. Now I just want to show you this real quick. I know it's a penalty, but this is another example. Watch the route here. Watch when the ball should be out right here. I mean, he's got to throw that football right there, and it's a touchdown. And obviously, he's capable of doing that. He's late here, but example again of just not quite being on the same page with his receivers and tied in. First and goal. Can they finally get it in? Not yet. Alvin Kamara. Saunders, who played the Block and roll is in there on the stop. Second down and goal. Clock ticking down to the end of the quarter. Who gets off the ball quicker here? Give Jacksonville the edge. Let better. Got into the backfield. There's the linebackers. Alouakon and Devin Lloyd cleaning it up. Hard to get a push in the interior. They can't let the clock run down. But they run the play here. And Kamara gets jammed up at about the half-yard line. So, they go another quarter without a touchdown at home. And we'll see what happens when they start the fourth from inside the one. End of three. Jaguars 24. Sold. Car under center. To Kamara. no, still can't get in Devin Lloyd shoves him out and here we go again this will be the 16th play of the drive fourth and goal as much as we talk about a Luocon Devin Lloyd is growing up, that's his 12th tackle of the night and he's got such range, I just feel like he's starting to see it and has the ability to get outside in a hurry I mean that's Kamara Can't get the edge against Devin Lloyd. Now Kamara comes out. Taysom Hill comes in. He got Saunders again. The defensive tackle in the backfield. Hill, yeah, he gets the touchdown. Saunders again leading the way. Guy's got a new career. Yeah, it's a good guy to follow, but give credit to the left side. Perot's over there on that left side. It moved in Trevor Penning. He just collapsed down here, and then the big man's able to lead it. There's just no one left. I think that becomes the answer for the Saints. Taysom Hill, we've seen him tonight in that Wildcat look, but gives you that extra blocker because his ability to take the direct snap and run the football. One word describes that. My little baby. It hits the upright and goes through. Never a dull moment. The rookie kicker putting it through. One possession game 24-16. One of those good doinks. John Madden coined that phrase. And, you know, it's the perfect sound. It's what it sounds like. It's a hollow doink. If he would have missed that, it would have been a big doink. Oh, yes, it would have been. That might have been a plane ticket tomorrow. Well, the Saints defense has kept them around and kept them within striking distance. If you've not seen the entire game, this game could have gotten sideways in a hurry with all the turnovers in the short field. that we've seen, but Saints have been able to keep them in this game. Eight points, one possession. Yeah, well, that one, 16 plays, 75 yards. I mean, that's grinding it out. They get seven first downs on that drive. And Jacksonville to get it at the 25. So Kirk for Trevor Lawrence, 17-23, 155 yards. Hasn't been stacked tonight. Start on the ground. ETN. Took an extra little moment there to make the ball secured. Turns it into an 11-yard gain. And again, that jet sweep action, all you're trying to do is get the defense to take just a couple steps this way off the edge. Just take a couple steps down, which they do. You pick up a nice block there on the edge by the receiver, Tim Jones. And with the speed and acceleration of ETN, he gets to that corner in a hurry. And you get positive yards. Nine carries for ETN, 46 yards. And a couple of touchdowns. Lawrence. Moving away. He's going to run for the third time tonight. I'm sure everybody on that bench wanted him to go out of bounds. He says, no, no, I'm going to get as much as I can here. And the Saints starting to take some more chances as we get into the fourth quarter, bringing some pressure. Remember, we talked about Lawrence going straight at no problem. But this, Perlet around the other way, that gives you a little bit of concern, but no ill effects at all. He's able to get up from that. And that's what he is able to do when he's healthy, is when things aren't there, he takes a bad play and makes it a good play. Second and six. Defense right there. Malcolm Roach making the tackle. Etienne taken down for a two-yard loss. Third and eight. Well, they win the line of scrimmage, and not just Roach, but, again, look how they're getting downhill. They don't allow the line, Sheriff and others, to get up to them because they aren't waiting. They're expecting the Jags to work clock, run the football, and see May 6th and 20 Warner there flying down to stop that running game against Etienne. They've been limped off there after that play. Puts Dearness Johnson in the game. He stays in to block. then he peels off and Lawrence gets taken down taken down there by Zach Vaughn so the pressure put on and it's fourth down and comes the punt group and the crowd comes to life they did they started to come to life after the touchdown and and I think Joe Woods is a defensive coordinator you know the job that he and Dennis Allen are doing it's a good offense they're facing and They're mixing up the looks at the right time, especially on third down. Creating confusion up front. Logan Cook, his fourth punt of the night. Plus one successful fake. And a nice boot to the seven-yard line. Early in the fourth field. Here's Lance Clark. The game is stopped to confirm the time. Second down. Okay. Lawrence fires that's caught on the run Christian Kirk inside the 20 he goes and Christian Kirk takes the ball all the way to about the one-yard line. They're going to spot it as he thinks he scored the touchdown, and they're going to call it a touchdown now. 44 yards for Christian Kirk. Into the end zone he goes. Watch the route here against Tyron Matthew. This is who we've been calling for really all night. Give him that option route based on leverage to work in or out, And that's a mismatch at this stage of Tyron Matthews' career. Kirk has such quickness and such a feel on these routes. So they were completely stymied offensively in the second half. And now just like that, similar to the New Orleans drive that took 51 seconds, you get the tying touchdown. This one takes 37 seconds, two plays. And Al against Matthew, Kirk can have an option to work to the inside. He goes in, then back out, and then he's back to the inside. And look how he separates with the ball in his hands. He and Evan Ingram both bring an approach, just kind of a pro's pro as far as how they show up to practice, show up in their preparation to get ready for a game. And I just, again, I felt that the matchup against the inside defensive backs, the slot corners, whether it was Taylor or Matthew coming down, that eventually Lawrence would have a chance to hit a big one. Late in the game, Kirk finally makes his presence felt. Cam Jordan can only look at that replay. Derek Carr. Can he lead him down the field again? Crazy game in so many ways. in the 25-yard line. Carr is 28 of 45 for 251. A touchdown and a pick. Remember the one time that they really looked in sync. They were in that tempo mode and they were going fast and he was getting the ball out of his hands quick and they were the aggressor and the Jags were sitting back looking at each other to try to make sure they're on the same page, and I think you'll see, obviously, more of that with 3.08 to go here. Over the middle, wide open, caught, hill, tackled at about the 43. And finally an answer to that split safety look. They get behind the backers and in between the safeties. One of the first times we've seen them hit a vertical shot down the middle. His fourth catch of the night. Over the middle. Into Jaguar territory goes Camara. And that's the beautiful thing. When you hit Hill like that behind those backers, they finally start to sink. and then you can check it down to Kamara and he's got more room to work. Half a yard shy, second in inches. Kamara again, first down. 2-41 he goes. Clock ticking down toward the two-minute warning. Each team, all three timeouts. Kamara's looked good catching that football out of the backfield when he's had just a little bit of room to work with. He checks out now and see Jamal Williams back in. That is the two-minute warning. Indeed it is. 31-24 Jaguars on top in New Orleans. They do the same thing. So inside two minutes now. Saints go to work. Flipping out here. caught. Shahid. Rashid. Shahid. Second down and short. Second and a deuce. Buck Carr in this fourth quarter. 9 of 12. 95 yards and a touchdown. A couple of yards. First catch of the night for a guy who was the offensive player of the year back in 2019. Yeah, the other thing that I think really stands out about Aluokon, one more thing about him is they said, when your best player is your hardest worker, just sets the tone for the rest of the defense. Second and two, get it off to Kamara, gets the first down. He gets tackled up at the 40-yard line by Angelo Blackson. There's the screen game. We've seen it called a few more times, and they've been trying to hit that over the last few weeks, and the timing has just been off. And tonight, Kamara has had a couple opportunities to get out there and make some plays. Astonishing, really. 22 drives without a TD in this building. Meanwhile, nice game here. That's Shahid who gets free. They really need to use him more. Gain a 13. Yeah, he's still just such a talented speedster, learning the position a bit raw. but in his second year, to get more and more comfortable with his role in this offense at the slot. Changing the middle line back in the mic. Hill. Tackling the open field. Darius Williams tackles and pays a little bit of a price on that one. Ging a 7. And for fans at home, when you hear him say 23s to Mike and he's about to snap the ball, and all of a sudden they move and then he switches it to 33. Imagine what that offensive line is doing. A lot of these guys have not played a lot of football together. So that's tough. They're praying. Yeah. Catches made by Olave. And that's a first down. So, again, a nice looking drive. And they move the ball very well in the middle of the field. but when they get down deep, huge problem. Yeah, and right now he's just smart to take these underneath throws. Jacksonville just sitting back, almost giving him the shorter throws to quit the game. Kamara blocking, but it breaks down and knifing through, and there's that man again, Aluokon. Boy, he closes in a hurry, doesn't he? He does. 6'2", 230. And, you know, all this entire defense, we had him late last year with Mike Caldwell in his first year as defensive coordinator. Lewicon came over last year from Atlanta. Now he's in his second year. Watch how quickly he's not wasting any time or energy in the way he comes up on that play. Carr steps up in the pocket. Takes the ball down to the 28-yard line. Tackled there by Tyler Lacey. And here comes the third down and five. It's been a rough night on the third downs. One of 11. This is where Jacksonville, they squeeze up, take away a lot of the easier throws instead of sitting back, trying to make Derek Carr hold on to the football and give Josh Allen time to get home. Not only one of 11, that one was on their first third down. Don't get one here either. Come up short, Kamara, setting up a fourth and two, three and a half to go in the third quarter. I mean, imagine that. How many times have we seen that? Everything's taken away downfield, and it's almost Derek Hart. It's not like he's back there, you know, pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch, check it down. He gets back there, one hitch, check it down. It's hard to work through your progressions when that's the case with your offensive line and protection. So Mike Caldwell, the defensive coordinator, long-time linebacker in the league. Little toss here on the fourth and two. Gets the first down. Kamara slung out of bounds at about the 16. Good block right here by Moreau, the tight end. You always worry when you're trying to get outside, is he going to hold? And he does a good job. Came close but did not grab onto the jersey there. Devin Lloyd. Slow developing and he gets to the outside and then he's able to get upfield. 10th play of the drive Camara starts one way goes the other good move inside the 10 behind a Cameron Irving block second down second and four he's got a lot of wiggle and shows great patience you know a lot of people want to know it's seventh year does he still have but he sure looks like it. He just needs help around him, right? At that time, just kind of working his way, navigating through the teeth of that Jacksonville defense. Cisco's. Here's, again, a condensed formation, but Ridley takes himself out of the play. Look how much room he has to work to the outside, Al. But look at this route. Look at the route. He's almost to the sideline, and as a quarterback, you need some room to be able to throw your receiver out to his outside shoulder. but he ran himself so close to the sideline, there's really no way that Lawrence could put that ball. Logan Cook, punt number five tonight. Fair caught 10-yard line. 4.30 left in regulation. That scoring drive. Carr. Thomas. down the right sideline there complete and then Thomas to the six points that's the best that offense has looked in weeks and it was three plays and that's what I think is so frustrating is you know what they're capable of doing they have again such great individual players it's just a matter of all coming together from the ten Carr hit as he throws and it's dropped put it right there Josh Allen got to Carr incomplete second down and ten it's a good job here and this is your fear really the whole game is can Allen turn the corner and he does but how about the strength of Derek Carr and the ball wasn't perfectly thrown but thrown well enough considering he got hit as he threw it a little behind But Olabi couldn't handle it. Carr fires caught. Hill. He's knocked down at the 17-yard line. Aluokan makes the stop. Big third down here. Third and four. Going quickly. No huddle. Carr, look out. Escapes. Throws on the run. incomplete pressure that time Aluokan that time blitzing Carr now all of a sudden bent over on the sideline of all things down to both knees he goes Carr took a shot he was trying to just do anything to keep that play alive Aluokan came right up the middle you'd think Kamara would come over here and pick this up but he's ready to try to get out of the backfield for a check down. So nobody picks up a Luokon, and there he is with the speed. You can see Shahid breaking there, but by the time he saw him, that is a tough throw to make. And reaching for the groin, going down, still down. Well, he had the AC joint week three, came back the next week, trying to work this one off. seen it through the years a tough hombre so in comes the punt group Hedley now the rookie punter fourth punt of the night line drive Hagen catches it on the run and goes out of bounds at the 45-yard line. So, only 12 passing yards in the second half. And from the 46, swings it out to ETN and goes next to nowhere. Taken out of bounds there by Taylor, second and eight. I'm interested to see what Press Taylor comes up with with his plan here with three and a half to go, tie game. Both teams full complemented timeouts. The two-minute warning is still out there. Obviously, they're thinking about points. They want to get this thing as close as they can. But I would think it's a combination of a couple first downs, work the clock, and make the Saints try to use those timeouts. So, Cresthaven back and away. Further Zach, the head coach of the Bengals. wheels turning wheels spinning the two head coaches checking down at eight might be a clock issue the officials gathering That's a leap and a half. He's ready to get into the second row. Well, that's the best this offense has looked, and they saved it for the best time in the game. They come up with a touchdown the previous drive. They get the ball back after a stop. They don't make it on fourth down the Jags. And boy, did New Orleans take advantage of great field position. A couple throws set him up on this. And what do we see in these last three plays? Watch the quarterback. One, two, three. Hitch falls out. Helps the offensive line. The tempo, the quick release. And Michael Thomas reminding the NFL community around the country, yeah, 13 still makes big plays for the Saints. His first touchdown of the season. Kamara with the two-pointers. You know at 24 9 you're going no way when they look awful awful Offensively then you go three plays take some 51 seconds Now this place is alive crowd goes wild And Jacksonville all of a sudden victory in their hip pocket Tie game, 6.38 to go. I said to you earlier about we're focusing so much on the Saints and what they need to do, but this is a Jacksonville team that thinks they're going to win their division. They're going to be a postseason team. They're still a young team learning how to be a winning football team. Had a 24-9 lead. Now they're going to have to fight for it to get out of here with a win. Put their foot off the gas offensively. Now try to do it again here. Four-yard pickup, maybe five to Evan Ingram. Close to the 30-yard line. Granderson makes the tackle. I really thought coming into tonight, the matchup that really favored Jacksonville's offense was Christian Kirk in the slot. Wouldn't be surprised to see them try to create some matchups and try to get him isolated. He and Ingram both can win on the inside of this defense. Lawrence. Going to run again. A lot of room. There he goes. What a night he's had as a rusher. Sprained knee at home. Didn't practice this week. Didn't take any contact during the week. And tonight he's carried the ball five times for 63 yards. Look at the linebackers. The last thing they're worried about tonight is Trevor Lawrence running. It's the third or fourth time that it's caught up to them. You know, they heard all week about, is Trevor going to play? We don't know. He's got the knee. He's probably not going to be able to move that much. So normally, if he's healthy, you're worried about him. You're spying him. You're aware of him. Tonight, they're not concerned about him. They play man underneath, and there's no one left home to take 16. That was a 23-yard game. Flip it to Ridley. and he cannot get around the corner. Bang down the bounce. First guy there is Marcus May. Marcus May read this from the very beginning. He looked and watched his eyes and watched the awareness to be able to say, oh, right now he's got to take off because Ridley can cover some ground. He is very fast. May makes a great play that time by not getting lulled to sleep. As an aggressive defense, sometimes you want to fly to the ball the other way but he stayed home was patient and angry couldn't block him second down in ten Lawrence to the outside no good tended there for Ridley third and ten and Devo covering on the play 4.43. Looking ahead, a ton of time, and everybody's got each team all of their timeouts, plus a two-minute warning. In a 24-24 game. Third down 10. Deep drop. Deep throw. Incomplete. Good coverage again. Ridley, the intended receiver, falls into Debo is here. And that Saints defense holds. Preparing the first defensive holding or illegal contact. In that category, all three of those categories, how many fouls Jacksonville has? None. Zero. Well, I would say it has a lot to do with the way Dennis Allen plays. He's as aggressive as anybody in the league. They're in the face of the receivers a lot of times. Etienne exploits that small opening. A little short of the first down. Taking time off the clock. May makes the stop. Under nine minutes to play. Third and one. I'd say a penny for your thoughts, but I can figure them out. Third and one. The win is nothing. BTN lunges just a little short. a Devo is there we're going to spot it you can spot it about as close to a first down as you can how about the individual effort by Etienne Werner gets penetration which forces him to bounce it to the outside and then he's down, looks like he may go down right there with a Devo but he gets his hand with the balance and he doesn't quite get the first down, close well Well, a very interesting call here. Fourth and inches. You don't make it. You give the Saints the ball near midfield. You make it, you can take a lot more time off the clock. Fourth and inches. Etienne, and with that, he tried to get to the second verse. He's going to be short. so that Saints defense in the middle stiffens when they had to huge stop in an eight-point game Nathan Shepard looked like he made the play 93 he's trying to push to help remember that the quarterback sneak would be obviously the play they would go with but with the knee injury you take that away. The defense from the Saints once again steps up. Really, it was 93, Shepard. Watch him work, engage, look into the backfield, push, and stop him right there. If you're a Jags fan, you're probably thinking, man, not having our quarterback healthy, able to run this. It's not a great exchange. Slow, developing play, and the Saints are able to rally to the football there. Exactly. Not the best exchange. Kamara is the back car with an opportunity down by 8 47 yard line as time throws caught and Thomas to the 35 yard line goes Michael Thomas second catch of the night first down they go fast here come up to the line of strimmage at the 36. Barr, down the sideline, open, makes the catch, Kaysom Hill. And just like that, the Saints at the 17-yard line. Yeah, nice job of throwing here. He gets back, ball is out, both of these throws. This time he read Jenkins, who came down from that safety spot, foot right over his head, layered that perfectly. Carr to the end zone. It's Thomas reaching for it. Is he out of bounds or in bounds? Touchdown is he at all. Buster Brown is there. How about that? What a catch. This town, this stadium, they've been waiting for this. That's three plays. Bang, bang, and a touchdown. Thomas wakes up and makes two big plays for this Saints offense. Does he get... Does that knee get down? Does the knee get down? It does. He is down. That's a touchdown. Again, the old John Madden line. One knee equals two feet. That ends the play right there with the knee down. They go for the two-point conversion to try to tie the game. Keep an eye out here at Taysom Hill Jamal Williams the running back There's Hill in the stack You've got Kamara now coming to the inside in the slot They go to Kamara Tie game Eight point game To left tackle They have been going at it Especially in pass pro Give Pete a lot of credit. He's given up the seven pressures, but he's not given up any sacks. He's come close, but he's holding his own. I wonder coming into this game out on the edge on an island where he hadn't played a lot of football this year, how would he hold up? And so far, he's doing okay. Josh Allen having a monster year, seven sacks already this year. He had six all of last year. Right, seven in the six games to this point. They're working on ETN on the bench. going to report ASAP on him. Meanwhile, here is Kamara going nowhere. Laxon is ready to wrestle him down again. Thinks better of it? Second down and 10. If you want to find a football and you're at home watching, just watch 33 and 23 in white if it's a run play. They are all over the run game. Darf Lobby To the 11-yard line He goes Herndon and Williams are there So now from deep in their own territory Third and five Big play, you don't make it Likely Jacksonville gets a short field Or a shorter field Carp Catch the ball, goes deep Whoa not even close Darius Williams covering Olave so it's fourth and five and again a third down with a frustrated Derek Carr and again you see Olave just stop on the route I don't know if he's expecting the ball to go somewhere else or balls thrown downfield and Olave who's a speedster he gives up on the route and I think he's expecting and he's saying what are you doing Yeah. Seen a lot of that all year. Lua Headley. Line drive punch. But it takes a good New Orleans bounce. I mean, Agnew is back there. And he lets it roll. So an ugly looking. To Columbus, yeah, for college game day. Then fly back down to Tallahassee for Florida State and Duke on Saturday night. Another easy weekend for you. Well, Etienne is back, and he flips the ball back here to Agnew, and he goes nowhere. I love this guy, Carl Granderson. As much as Cameron Jordan gets talked about, and he should with the career he has had, I just, when you watch him on defense, he really shows up and plays so smart. And this time, you know, he's watching, anticipating, and thinking about Trevor Lawrence It's potentially coming around out maybe a boot or a naked, but instead he gets to reverse. Some more stuff on the sideline. That kind of night. Second and 11. Lawrence going deep and along the sideline. The catch, Ridley, is Ridley, and then the officials check it out. They're going to call it. for the moment it looked like the Jaguars are coming up to make sure they didn't review it and that Adebo is there how about the ball the left foot looks like it's out of bounds yeah it is waiting for the cold Jaguars thought maybe it was a catch running up to the line before they could review it nothing to review third and eleven heck by the way he came really close to making one of the best catches we've seen in the first six weeks plus one game of the year I I mean, it was a one-handed grab and a great throw. Third down 11. Fired. Too high. No good. They want a flag. The Debo covering on the play, and there is the flag on a pass intended for Agnew. Saints are out there stating their case that the ball wasn't catchable. Defense number 29. First down to 5-5. Yeah, it's amazing with all these receivers. I tell you, in critical moments tonight, Trevor Lawrence has looked up Jamal Agnew a lot. And here he is working from a condensed formation, works out and then back in. That's one thing the Saints have had a lot of is some interference calls with the way they play all year this year. Such a tight coverage. First out on the penalty. That's the 14th penalty this season against the Saints. Kamara. Inside the 20, he goes. Wind guard making the tackle. Gain of 15. The defensive line took themselves out of the play. And the offensive line able to get up to those backers, giving Kamara some room. Car escapes. Fires it away. Man, we had a very low scoring game, which has been the case with mainly the Saints this year. I mean, you were living large if you liked the under. But not tonight. They've only had one game where they've scored over 20 points coming into tonight. Right. Right. Second and ten. That's caught. Taking it to the 10-yard line. Alave third down. Clock running under 120 now. He motioned from the left to the right. Widened out Devin Lloyd who followed him. And then went back underneath on that angle route. Third down to Kamara. He's got the first. The six-yard line. Let's give this offensive line some credit. You know, we've been questioning them all night. When it comes to pass protection, they're finally getting a little push up front. You know what's real interesting here is the strategy, the timeout strategy. If you're Jacksonville, you really don't want to take the timeout. You don't want to take it if you're New Orleans. Either be some going to score. You don't want to leave Jacksonville any timeout. So, thus, each team still has all of its timeouts. And that pass is incomplete. I mean, it's one of those weird deals where nobody wants to really take the timeout. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Jacksonville is thinking, all right, you know, hey, the way they are in the red zone, you never know. Let that clock keep going. And you're right, they're thinking, we don't want to give Trevor Lawrence any time left. And the big question now is, if New Orleans gets into the end zone, does Allen go for two? First things first. Second down and goal. Carr, time running out, avoids the sack, fires too high, incomplete. Tended there for Hill. You got Allen going down, you got all kinds of action here. Little kind of a little slower getting up, Carr gets up. bobbles a little needs a moment bends over there's that matchup again with Pete against Allen remember when Carr's had success it's not when he's back there in the pocket waiting for receivers to get open it's when he's gotten back and a hitch and the ball out that time holding the ball down in this area usually doesn't lead to success for any offense but especially this offense that has struggled so much in the red area. Now New Orleans has to take it. The car needed an extra moment there. Lake clock was running down. So they need just to regroup, get settled, figure out what they want to do on third down and goal. Wait, 24-9? I don't think anybody expected this. I mean, New Orleans looked like they wouldn't score for a month. Oh, bang. The game broke out. The Bonanza broke out. They put Keith Kirkwood in the game. The team barely seen him tonight. He goes wide to the right. Third and goal. Carr. To the end. Oh! The fingertips of Moreau. Could not hold it in. Setting up a fourth and goal. So close. Yeah, perfectly timed. The execution is there. The one hitch, ball out. A miscommunication by the Jags. He had two defenders that watched both the defenders, Jenkins and Brown, 30-2, just sit up front. Big hole in the back. Carr read it perfectly. The ball's just dropped. the Saints are four for five on third down tonight on fourth on fourth fourth and go on fourth down again to the end zone all kinds of
