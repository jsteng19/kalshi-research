 It's reps. How much has a guy played? And you take over a program that's just really on the back burner in the Big 12 to a Big 12 championship and a fiestable win over Oregon his junior year. So he's got confidence because he's been out there and been through a lot of good and a lot of bad. And I think it's made him who he is today. That's Ayuk setting up on the outside and on the wing. Give it to McCaffrey again with a huge goal. Christian McCaffrey out to the 45-yard line. What a pickup that was. One of the big surprises this year has been the left guard, Aaron Banks. Watch he, the double, the combination here, the double team with the center, Jake Brendel, watch him work and just push the nose guard there out, Shelby Harris, and it opens it up. And that's the vision. This is what now Kyle Shanahan has, is a true running back in McCaffrey who's got great vision and quickness to be able to accelerate through a hole like that. Comes off a game in which he ran for 119 against the Buccaneers. He's also a great pass catcher, averaging six receptions per game in his career. Give it to him again. Threads his way up to the 48-yard line. Let's go to Kaylee. Al, Brock Purdy got a lot of encouragement from his teammates before his first start Sunday, but not from Fred Warner. Warner told me, I know when a guy is so locked in and ready for a moment, he doesn't need anything said. But after the win, Warner asked Verde if he wanted to break down the team. And Verde said, no, I'm just another piece of a puzzle. Warner told me it was the perfect Brock moment. It's never about him. It is always about the team. Well, so far, it's been, as I say, something out of Fantasyland. Brian Monet is down for the Seahawks. Meanwhile, they're also missing Allen Woods up front. It's the last thing they need, a defensive front that's been shredded lately, losing another guy. Halfway through the quarter. Missed it off the field. We talked about Woods being gone. Quinton Jefferson comes in to spell him. At least they got Shelby Harris back, number 93, who got sick last week before the game and missed the game against Carolina when they gave up 223 yards on the ground. Second and seven. McCaffrey. It's a nice block. And of course that's the fullback Kyle Juszczyk who plays well and very often. Probably more than any fullback in the league leading the way. Of course you've got Kyle Stairspeed Carroll. Carroll's in his 13th season with Seattle. Kyle Shanahan on the other side. Sixth season in San Francisco. Pete knows too well that defense has been the major issue that run defense in particular. Third down and three from the 49-yard line. That's caught to the 41-yard line. Jawan Jennings. Looks like it was close to an offside, but no flag. Well, they're going to clear out the rookie right here with a deeper slant, and then it opens up right underneath. There's Kobe Bryant who clears out, gives him a nice window to be able to throw the ball underneath. Good execution. You know, you play receiver for this offense, you're going to block, and you're going to buy into blocking, which they do. Jennings and Ayoub tonight doing a great job, and then you get your opportunities, and you've got to take advantage of them right on cue there. Toss to McCaffrey. Nice tackle there right at the line of scrimmage. Luchena Nwosu, the former Charger, came over as a free agent this year, stopping him for no gain, second and ten. We just talked about Nwosu or Jennings. Watch this job that he has. He's been doing a good job of setting the edge here. They're trying to get to the outside, a little pin and pull, But look at him get off of that block and the closing speed that he has for a big man at 255 pounds. Second and 10 at the 41. 34 for four, all short passes for 21 yards. Shoots one to McCaffrey. That's a first down to the 30-yard line. Boy, I tell you what, what a pickup that was in the middle of the season. They got, they mortgaged a little bit of the future. You got a chance. You got a Super Bowl contending team. You get a guy like this, he could take you over the top. Well, and I think he has a reputation more about his ability to catch the ball, right? I mean, everybody always talks about plays like that. But what we've seen since he's come in here is his ability to run the football. They've had some injuries in that backfield. You know, they've lost some people. So he comes in at the right. It's a second time to go up against him. Holding the zone for the most part. A good job of working out there to get to him. Second and 21. And down he goes. Speaking of 97, Bosa. 15 and a half now in the year. It's the combination of speed and power from Nick Bosa. We just talked about how he's doing a pretty good job with Cross, but it's never ending. See how low he is to the ground? He is so, look how low he is. Maintains his balance and then finishes on the play. It's as good as there is. Well, there's Joey, of course, with the Chargers. Meanwhile, here is on a third and 32. You've got Metcalf at least trying to get into field goal range. And it's fourth and 19 at the 33-yard line. I saw Nick on the field before the game. He's in the best shape of his life. I asked him, I said, dude, look at you. I mean, sculpted. I said, it's the best shape of your life? He said, no question. I mean, he's gone to another level with his commitment away from the game. Like a lot of these guys, the diet. He said, no carbs. He said, that's tough for me as an Italian guy. I can't have any pasta, no bread, nothing. Tough for anybody. 51-yard field goal attempt by Myers is good. 8-0-8 left in the third. It's now 21-6, San Francisco. And that's 4-2-6 at the combine. From the goal line, Ray Ray McLeod. taken up to the 29-yard line. You know, it's funny, a guy that fast, that big, that range, he lasted to the fifth round? That's what I was going to say. Even with that 4-2-6, he still went in the fifth round. I think a lot of it had to do with how raw he is. You just went through what he experienced. And he told us, man, I played offense my whole life. I didn't move to corner until I was my junior year in college. And so it's new for me. And I think he's learning that you imagine where he'll be in three years or four years. John Schneider really found a gem there. Yeah, well, he and Pete Carroll coming in together. Had a really good draft this year. Made the Wilson trade. Here goes McCaffrey fighting his way close to a first down. Woolen's numbers this season, six picks, nine forced incompletions. The passer rating well below the league average that he's held the receivers to. I'm talking about, you know, what Schneider's done. Meanwhile, they had the picks from Denver. Last year, they've got Denver's first and second round choices in the next draft. And right now, if the season ended today, they'd have the second pick in the draft. That would be Denver's pick. Second and one. McCaffrey. It's tripped up and forward progress will be spotted close to a first down. Talking about Wolin, because he has all the interceptions this year, leads all the corners, and here he is right in front. Good job of being able to get through that block by Juszczyk. Maybe gets away with a potential trip there, but is involved in bringing down McCaffrey. It looked like that back of his right foot kind of kicked up towards McCaffrey. had enough of the first down ball at the 39 yard line 647 Jordan Mason comes into the game rookie running back at a Georgia Tech saw plenty of action last week against Tampa Van here he sees his first action of the night first time anybody's carried the ball except McCaffrey and Purdy tonight second down I love the look of this rookie and what he can do at 225 pounds and you know you just obviously now at this stage of the season McCaffrey has settled into this offense but it sure is nice to have a thumper kind of a change of pace guy that can help continue to wear down the defense depending on what game they get into down the road remember number 24. Team in for that one play McCaffrey comes back in second down and nine Purdy Goes down to the 34 yard line Clinton Jefferson Gets to him there In Woson From the 39 yard line Here goes Walker Game to five Terry what did you think on that last play? Al the tackle starts inbounds It's all one action The momentum takes them into the sideline. It's not a foul for unnecessary roughness. Here it is. Tackle starts inbounds and then finishes it out of bounds. For all the world, of course, it looks like a flag, and then the whole bench jumps up and the crowd wants it. Nothing. Second and five. He's going to the outside, and that's caught by Noah Fant. For a first down, one of the guys who came over, in addition to all the draft choices they got from Denver, he came over in the trade as well. The Seahawks giving the 49ers some of their own medicine, moving Fant in motion. Just by moving him, you create a little bit of space, and Al Shire, the linebacker, trying to adjust, but he gets behind the receiver. He's got that space to work, and he's got wide receiver skills That was a big tight end. From the 22-yard line, Smith throws, and that's thought, but Metcalf is blanketed. Ward is there. Warner comes over to help out short game, second and eight. Traverius Ward is following D.K. Metcalf on a lot of these plays, and not only is he following him, he's up in his face on every single route, making him work to get open. I mean, this is about a three-yard gain. I haven't seen a play yet that the Seahawks have run where seven and white isn't right in the face, pressing D.K. Metcalf to affect the timing with Geno Smith. Now they move into the slot to get away from Ward. Provides a cushion that time. Smith throws, and that's incomplete. He had a whole bunch of white shirts there trying to get it into Colby Parkinson to tie it in. Hufunga bats it away. It'll be third down and eight. Hufunga has had a monster year with four interceptions, and it's because of his instincts. Watch him just look and recognize that he's got an outside route breaking in, which allows him to break on the ball so quickly. That's not just sitting back in coverage. That's recognizing that the inside receiver is going to go to the out, The outside receiver is going to break in and then stepping up and almost coming up with his fifth interception of the year. Final five minutes of the half. Look out. Smith. Incomplete. Had it backed up. Was hit as he threw it. Eric Armstead is early fourth down and eight, and the field goal group comes in. There's Armstead with another move. You know, you see the twists, and here he's going to work around again, force that offensive line to have to communicate, and it's another time where Seattle up front not able to adjust to one of the twists up front. Jason Myers, 24 of 25 field goal attempts. This is a 38-yarder. Dixon puts it down, and the kick is good. An 11-play drive from their own 18. the entire year was 2019. So he's got these numbers, and he hasn't played 20 or 21 that much football. Check in with Kaylee. Al, Christian McCaffrey told me he didn't have time to say goodbye to many of his teammates in Carolina when he got traded. He told me he had to eliminate all emotion and just get right to the grind here. And with such a detail-oriented scheme, he credits running backs coach Anthony Lynn and veteran assistant Bobby Turner with helping him pick up the playbook as quickly as he did. Yeah, Anthony Lynn, the former head coach of the church. Speaking of not having time to say goodbye to your teammates, how about Baker Mayfield last week? Got on a plane. How'd he do last week? You know, similar. I mean, I think he got to San Francisco on a Thursday and played that week. And since that game, they've won six in a row with him here. Out of the pistol this time. That pass is not hold in. Coverage was there. Kittle is covered that time by Ryan Neal. Second down and ten. Jamal Adams out with a quad, out for the year. They had to rely on Ryan Neal, who's been a journeyman. But, man, he is taking advantage of this opportunity to become a full-time starter. Again, the ball not quite out. It spread third-worst loss of Tom Brady's career. took him out at the end of the game because it was garbage time. How about that? Who could have figured? Second down and seven. Not Brady, Purdy. Off the fake. Rolling, throwing. That's caught. And finding his way for a couple of yards there is George Kittle. Jordan Brooks, who's Seattle's leading tackler, brings him down. Kyle Shanahan, in his sixth season, took him to the Super Bowl after the 89 campaign 48-46 is regular season mark and with a win tonight he's on his way to the playoffs again Trey Lance of course was the starting quarterback at the beginning of the year got hurt in week 2 gone for the season that let Garoppolo come back he's gone and now it's Hurdy's team third and five hanging in the pocket Throws caught up at the 19-yard line and reaching is McCaffrey, but they're going to spot it a little bit shy. Tackle made there by Ryan Neal, and in comes the punting group. And now, as you know, when McCaffrey goes out wide, the question is who do you put out there on him? Here's the safety, Ryan Neal. Eyes on the ball. Great understanding of where that first down marker is. He expects that route and is able to close on it quickly and not give the uber-talented McCaffrey a chance, even with a stretch to get to that first down. How unusual it is. The 49ers on three and outs only 12% of the time this season. That's once per eight possessions for a three and out. Meanwhile, here's Lockett taking in the punt from Wisnowski at the 35-yard line. Downtown Seattle. No score here. 10.57 left in the opening frame. And truly, it's the line of scrimmage. and spending the resources on this defensive line has really paid off. Take to Walker. Look out. Smith under pressure and just dumps it. Was it a pass? It's a pass, they say. Armstead put the pressure on that time, and Smith just dumped it away. He is such a difference maker now that he's back and healthy and in the interior. Remember, he moved from outside to inside last year, and look how quick he is. It's 6'7", 290. You worry so much about Bosa, and you should, but don't forget about the combination. Sometimes they line up on the same side, sometimes opposite. But he is a force in the interior. Good thing the fan was close enough. Otherwise, that would have been grounding. Second down and 10. Look out there. Bouncing off a would-be tackle, Walker. But he can only get back to the 33-yard line. It's with Kenneth Walker. Jimmy Ward finally takes him down, but bounced away. Now, they don't blitz a ton, but when they do, you can see how effective they can be, even against the run. You're trying to run the rookie. Look at the linebacker, Drake Greenlaw, right in there, just pushing him back. And this defense, one thing you've got to love, if you love defensive football, the way these guys fly to the football as a group, somehow Walker keeps his balance, but the pursuit and the team effort on this defense just never lets you down from one play to the next. Pushed into his own man, the center, Austin Black, that was thinking of the butt fumble on that play. Close. Third down and 12 from the 33-yard line. Smith looks downfield and throws to the outside and getting to the 38-yard line. That time is Noah Fant. Fred Warner makes the tackle, and the Seahawks will punt. Just little things the way they leverage the football here on a third down. Jimmy Ward, who's moved from free safety now to nickel, just coming up there in support. He takes the outside angle to force him back into the middle, and there's Fred Warner able to clean it up. Again, just the epitome of team defense with D'Amico Ryan's group. Michael Dixon in his fifth year as a rookie. He made the Pro Bowl. Ray-Ray McLeod. Back to accept it. The pressure was on. And McLeod again will make a fair catch this time at the 14-yard line. 5.47 into the game. Nothing, nothing. Lance, it was going to be his job. Garoppolo's practicing on another field during training camp. He gets hurt last week. And he's shown a ton of composure. He really did. In the two games in which he's played. In relief of Garoppolo. and then last week as a starter, and he shoots that out to Christian McCaffrey, who came over in that trade with Carolina. Gain of seven, second down and three. He had 46 starts in college, and more and more people you talk to around the NFL, they look at experience. He'll send it down toward Tyler Lockett, who sets up at the 10-yard line. Fair catch at the 19-yard line. trying to get this team rolling right now after three successive three and outs. And this is Kenneth Walker going nowhere. You know, it's funny. We asked him yesterday about the fact that, you know, how'd you find out that Russell Wilson got traded? He said, you have a heads up. He said, Pete called him and he said, I'm going to need you this year. That sort of was a hint, wasn't it? I think it was. And I think on the outside with the trade with Drew Locke coming over from Denver, I think a lot of people assume maybe Locke might get the inside track. But internally, led by Pete Carroll and the players especially, I think they knew based on what they'd seen that he was their guy, you know, and brought the leadership that they needed. Yeah, there was some competition, but clearly he was going to be the man right from the get-go. Second down and eight, and he fires that one, and that's caught up at the 33-yard line. So Metcalf makes his first catch of the night. Ward covers on the play and a first down. Yeah, we're going to go back to this matchup. We're going to see it all night. Ward against Metcalf. Two very physical players. We know about Metcalf. He's really grown as a receiver. Used to just be a go-ball guy and has now really developed to become a complete receiver. Good tight coverage, but nice job by Geno Smith to get that ball in there. Yeah, they go without a huddle. Go five wide here, and that's caught by Metcalf. Back-to-back. So they've got it rolling now. Picking up back-to-back first downs. Then I have a three and a half. Warner makes the stop. And you spread it out. And now you get a linebacker who's been really good in the inside. But now you've got him out in space. Greenlaw against Metcalf. There's the difference with D.K. Metcalf. Instead of just putting him in the X at one position, he's really grown and developed. They like to move him around. He runs all the routes now in the route tree. Back-to-back plays where he makes a difference. Yeah, back-to-back. 13-yard gains. First down from the 46. Goes to him again, but that time nothing is there. Tiberius Ward covering on the play, second down and ten. Tiberius Ward's not going anywhere. You can make back-to-back plays. He said, okay, let's line up again. And he is up tight. This is a tough route against a talented physical corner to try to be able to execute. And that ball has got to be out in front. You put it behind him just slightly. Ward has the kind of hands and instincts to step in front and make the play. And that's a battle to watch. Metcalf at 6'4 and 235. And fast. Second and ten. To the outside. This time they hit Walker. The running back. Short game. Lenore makes the stop on the play. Lenore third down and eight. Shane Waldron. A few adjustments here on this drive after not having much success at all. is trying to get this defense out in space, trying to create some space for Geno Smith and these receivers. Tried to run the ball early, tried to set up play action, wasn't effective. Now they're trying to spread them out, see if they can win some one-on-one battles. Flag is thrown, they stop the play. Blow the play dead. on the offensive side first. Offense number 16. Lockett. Trying to draw. It looked like Bosa started to move and maybe had a chance to get him over. Lockett ends up moving. They continue to be behind the sticks on these third downs. They're 0 for 4 on the night. Already now a third down and 13 for whatever Shane Waldron calls on this play. Smith stepping up. Going to keep it. Into 49ers. Angino runs for a first down. And they want a flag at the end of the play. I think he was tackled out of bounds by Hufunga. DeCarroll pleading his case here after a 20-yard game. Pressure here. Hufunga is here. Nobody really there to spy. So once he gets out of that pocket, a little pump fake there to hold Dre Greenlaw. The only guy left is Hufunga, who has to come all the way across the field. And this is what they're talking about. Hufunga actually finishes the play, brings him to the ground, and that's why I think they thought they'd get the 15 yards. And they did cross before time had expired. So they go from faking like they're going to go for it to now Kyle Shanahan, with the confidence he has in his defense, maybe really thinking about going for it. Reset the game clock to one second. Great city to have it in now. Michaels for a curb street. Kaylee Hartung, Wisnowski to punt to start the second quarter with a flag thrown. and the ball for the moment will bound into the end zone and the flag was thrown near the line of scrimmage. Checking with Pete Carroll. Illio formation. Kicking team number six was not on the line of scrimmage. That five-yard penalty will be added to the end of the play. First down from the 25. We talked about the two rookie tackles for the Seahawks. Charles Cross, Abraham, Lucas. And they have played, take a look at that, almost every snap this season. Lucas, in fact, has played every snap. Cross has played all but two. So Geno Smith gets the job and they gift him with two rookies. Help up front. First here he's out. They bring in two cornerstone offense alignment. Yeah. And that pass is thrown into traffic and is incomplete. Intended for D.K. Metcalf. Traverius Ward, the former Kansas City Chief, having a great year, makes the play on it. This is a matchup that we want to see tonight. Metcalf against Ward, who came over from Kansas City, has his head turned right away. Locks him up. Head turned. Good technique. Guys like Terry will give you a little bit more forgiveness when you get your head turned to locate the football and let you push a little bit more. Second down and 10. Got a five-yard gain here. So here we are at this point early in the second quarter. Seattle's run 13 plays for a total of 10 yards. Exactly the way Pete Carroll did not want the game to start. He didn't want to get into a hole against his team and obviously all week talked about the importance of helping Geno Smith out and being able to run the football to have more balance than they've had these last four weeks. Shane Waldron, first season as the offensive coordinator. Third down and five here now from the 30-yard line. Smith swings it to the outside. Homer, and he'll get stopped before he can reach the line to gain. So Travis Homer is there. that Dre Greenlaw making the stop fourth down. How beautiful is this when you can get this kind of pressure where Geno Smith, who talked all week about how he's got to check it down, but you play zone, two safeties deep, five guys underneath, and look how, again, leverage the ball, and the rest of the linebackers are able to come in there and clean it up. So what a luxury when you have the four that can bring that kind of pressure. Just threw a flag at the 49-yard line within the past couple of seconds. Guys trying to get off and on the field. After the play was over, taunting. Offense number 14. 15-yard penalty. Well, that's DK Metcalf. After the play. Check it out. He's going at it there with Dre Greenlaw. These guys going back to their SEC days Arkansas with Greenlaw and Ole Miss With DK Metcalf He also had a hand gesture involved as well In addition to whatever Was orally presented In the 28-yard line Ray-Mary McLeod runs it back at the 35 And a nice tackle is made there By Rattigan and a late flag now comes in on the other side of the field. During the return, holding, receiving team number 21, with a 10-yard penalty, it'll be a first down for San Francisco, timeout. 13.21 to go in the first half in Seattle. 7-0 49ers. It's in the NFL that flies to the football and plays with more discipline than D'Amico Ryan's. He has to be a hot player. He played on the U.S. men's soccer team in the recent World Cup. And they're also members of the Seattle Sounders. Your first game here, Kirk. Yeah, man. There's a little bit of sound in this place. I'm fired up. This is going to be great. Robbie going to kick off. Niners won the toss. They defer and off we go To the five line Iguibuque out past the 20 finally tackled up at the 35 line Good run back to start things. Geno Smith, a great story, picked by the Jets a decade ago. Started as a rookie, played a lot in his second year, and then basically on the bench for the next seven seasons. But when Russell Wilson was traded to Denver, and you see his numbers there are 3-1 touchdown to interception ratio. In he's come, and he's done the job so far. And as Kaylee said, the question is, can they get that running game going? With a rookie, Walker, flanking him and taking the handoff and working his way up to the 40-yard line for a gain of five. And, of course, he played at Wake Forest first and then out of Michigan State last year. Yeah, in this world of transfer portal in college football, Michigan State brought him in. And in his first year had a monster year. In fact, went on to win the Doak Walker as the top running back in the sport a year ago. And has really settled in very nicely here his first year with Rashad Penny going down. Yeah, Penny got hurt week five. Pass is caught. It's Lockett making the grab. And they pick up a first down. Tyler Lockett, who's scored a touchdown in each of his last six games. I think that's a sign of things to come with Geno Smith, getting the ball out quickly in rhythm. The goal tonight is to be able to run the ball enough to make the 49ers defense appreciate it and then get the ball out quickly before Bosa and company can get in. Off play action. Set up the screen into a lot of traffic, and that is read perfectly by Aziz Alshire. He's right there. Didn't fool anybody. Small loss on the play. These linebackers as a trio are as good as there is. The top group in the NFL, Alshire. Watch how quickly he feels this offensive line. 68, Damian Lewis starts to creep out, and right away that tipped off, I sure. And before really Kenneth Walker can have any chance of getting away from him, he's wrapped up for a loss. Second down and 13. Niners rush four. Smith escapes the sack. Throws on the run. It's almost picked off. He was lucky. Drake Greenlaw almost secured it. Can't. Third down and 13. Again, against this 49er group on these intermediate throws. Cross the middle. They've been throwing a lot this year. Here's the tight end. These backers match up well. You know, Fred Warner gets most of the attention, but we've seen Al Shire in the previous play and Greenlaw here in coverage and the work that they can do. You better be accurate against this group. That Niner defense, fewest points allowed, fewest yards allowed, number one against the rush. They have been fabulous. Travis Homer is the third down back. Smith backing up throws, and that is incomplete. That is Ward there intended for Lockett. Jimmy Ward covering, so after an initial first down, out they go, and the Niners will get the ball. This is what you've got to deal with, these stunts. You'll get Greenlaw on the outside, but watch Bosa work to the inside. D'Amico Ryan's just trying to give a different look, make this offensive line have to communicate. You see the back does a good job, Homer, of stepping up, but you could just feel and sense that Geno Smith knew that pressure was coming and wanted to get rid of the football. Michael Dixon to send it down toward Ray-Ray McLeod. McLeod calls for and makes the fair catch at the 10-yard line. And when we come back, we will see one Brock Purdy and the Niners offense on Thursday night. Crowd in full throat already. Christian McCaffrey is the running back. Their first play from the 10-yard line is a little toss to the former Carolina Panthers, chased by Barton out of bounds after a pickup of about three. Let's set up Hurdy. Four-year starter at Iowa State. Grew up in Arizona. Last week, his numbers against the Buccaneers, they routed him. By halftime, it was 28-0. In terms of a candidate for head coaching, no question. Remember, he replaced Robert Sala, another head coach of the New York Jets. Ryan's played 10 years in the league, went to some Pro Bowls. He's got great players, but they are so cohesive. Six games in a row, give it up no more than 17 points in any one game. McCaffrey fights his way for what would have been about a two-yard gain, turns it into a six-yard run. Puna Ford makes the stop there. Second and four. It's just his leg drop. You know, I mean, he's not a finesse guy. You think he's finesse because of his game and what he does in catching the ball. But watch his legs. He's a powerful guy in the way he runs. And he never stops. Look at him. Never gives up on a play. Play action and rolling and throwing and caught. Ayuk. For another first down. So Purdy remains perfect on the night. 10 of 10 for 89 yards. A little levels concept. You run the football. You run the football. This is Kyle Shanahan. You know that this boot is going to come. Three different levels. Finds that second and intermediate throw. being decisive gives Iyuk a chance to not just catch the ball, but they are notorious for yards after the catch. Something to keep an eye on tonight. At the 46. McCaffrey. You're a former quarterback, so we're worried about, as the flag comes in again, they're worried about the rib, the left side, and all that. You seeing anything tonight so far? Nothing. Nothing. And it's on his left side. He's not shown any kind of sign of discomfort. Then again, he looks a lot like he did last week as far as fitting in and understanding and having answers on every play. Guy looks like he's been out there his whole life, right? Legal block in the back. Offense number 11. Ten-yard penalty. Still first down. That's on Ayuk. I mean, I love these receivers. I love how they block. Here, Ayuk just getting a little aggressive. Hits Kobe Bryant on the back. Good call there to catch that. But, yeah, you know, this era of superstars at receiver, and it is fun to watch 11 and 15 when Debo Samuel's here. He leads the parade himself about getting involved and helping this run game because it's going to only open up play action and opportunities for them in the pass game. Samuel hurting his ankle last week didn't know how long he'd be out Shanahan said three-ish weeks is how he put it Kittle George Kittle out to the 48 yard line, Michael Jackson with the tackle there Even there it's just nice to see that he doesn't panic he doesn't get to a point where he forces a throw or he looks downfield to try to make a play I mean, he was back there. He had plenty of time. Give the line credit to give him that opportunity. But just a smart decision. With this offense, if you can just take care of the ball and play smart, then it's really going to eventually work out for you with the defense you have in a running game to go with it. So, Geno Smith spent a lot of time on the bench. 49ers 2-1 ratio in time of possession. And for the first time in the game, Hurdy throws an incomplete pass. That time Quandre Diggs came in, glitching, and knocked him down, third and nine. Yeah, and this is the matchup that he wants. You've got to understand that Diggs comes free. Nobody picks him up, but you've got McCaffrey against Cody Barton. That's a win, especially with this cushion. And look at this move. Boom, top of the route, gets to the outside. And if you put that ball out in front of him, now it's easier to say, look at this, and he's got a safety going in on him. Put that out in front of McCaffrey, and that's a huge gain. Yeah, Diggs broke it up. Third down and nine. To the outside and incomplete, a little low and away. Ayuk, the intended receiver. And the 49ers will punt for the third time in the half. Dialing up a little bit more pressure here these last couple plays. And that time it maybe shows the inexperience from Purdy. He's trying to put that ball to the outside to Ayuk. and Ayuk trying to come right back to him. Never really had a chance there to get the first down. Mitch Wisnowski. Right time to be the featured back and gives him an element they just haven't had with ability to catch and, of course, run the football. Here he is again. Of course, they lost Elijah Mitchell early in the season, so they did need that primary back. Of course, they also line up a ton of time with two backs. Meanwhile, there goes Monet on the cart going back to the locker room. I think Kyle Shanahan does as good a job as anybody at mixing up the looks. Here's that closer look at Monet. Right away, grabs that left leg. Fake toss. Two fake tosses. And then to kettle over the middle. Touchdown, San Francisco. He faked it to McLeod. He faked it to McCaffrey. And then hits Kittle over the middle. Tell me this guy doesn't look like he's in his seventh year in the league. Again, outstanding execution. But Kyle Shanahan knows how to draw these plays up. Uses a motion, this rocket motion he hasn't shown all game. And then he's going to pump fake that to the left. He comes back, moves the lineman, draws the linebacker's attention, looks like a screen to the right, pumps that, and then a delay to one of his favorite targets, Kittle, for the touchdown. Two pumps, six points, 28 yards. Robbie Gold, the ageless one, boots that one through with 3.49 to go in the opening quarter in Seattle. San Francisco leads 7-0. He's got Ray-Ray McLeod. What's going to happen with Deebo Samuel out? You've got Ray-Ray McLeod right here going in motion, and now you're going to set up a little fake. Now we're going to pull the lineman. Everybody's expecting they're going to throw that draw and great job of patience by Kittle and waiting until finally releasing. Look at the ball handling. Again, he looks like a seasoned veteran in the way he's executing this offense. I think the whole league right now is watching this game and this quarterback because at home, it was impressive. Okay, let's see what he's going to do on Thursday night when he goes to Seattle and deals with the 12s and that atmosphere. Now we'll see. Pretty good start for the young quarterback. Yeah, on three days rest. Of course, for years they've always called the last guy pick in the draft, Mr. Irrelevant, whatever that means. But I think it's, is it better being the last guy drafted or the first guy not drafted, right? You're a free agent. You'd probably get a better deal. I would say it depends on who's selecting you. Right. The 49ers and Kyle Shanahan and the culture that they have and the way they built this thing, defense, offensive line, run the football, and put the quarterback in a position to be effective with distributing and making good decisions and taking care of the ball. That's what he's done. Dick fielded by Godwin Kigweguke from inside of the five. and fights his way all the way out to the 34-yard line. Kaylee, what you got? Al, on Sunday we saw these heartwarming images of Brock Party's family during his first start. His dad, Sean, described the day as an out-of-body experience. But he told me he got emotional before his son even scored a touchdown. The family actually got to go see Brock before the game, and he said as he walked out of the tunnel, Sean said he and his wife, Curie, were so overcome that Nick Bosa's mom had to console them. Tonight they're back home in Arizona, but you know they're watching closely. Oh, you bet. No question about that from the 32-yard line. Here's Walker. Yeah, his home is in Arizona. He was a great high school player in a suburb of Phoenix. Never got a sniff from Arizona State. Looked at Alabama and, of course, wound up at Iowa State. And I think Iowa State was, I loved his answer. He wanted to leave a legacy behind, not just go and play for a team. And Matt Campbell, the head coach there, brought him in, and he made a huge difference and left his imprint there for sure in Ames. Lock it in motion. Look out. Smith loses it. And it's Lucas trying to recover it and does. Hufanga came in. He was the guy. Smith never saw him. and then the rookie right tackle Abraham Lucas at least is able to cover it up and keep possession. Again, he's lined up across. He looks like he's just maybe in tight coverage with the tight end Disley and then he comes up late. Look at the quarterback's eyes. Never really accounts for him or sees him. Nobody picks him up. Perfectly timed up blitz. You'd love to see Colby Parkinson who was lined up as a tight end in that backfield like a fullback, but nobody sees him with the late blitz. Third and 18. Ward giving no quarter. Playing press all the way on Metcalf. Smith looks the other way. Throws and then is caught. Time to lock it, making the catch along that sideline. They'll go to the line of scrimmage quickly. Lenore making the stop on the play, second and three. It's almost as if D'Amico Ryan just came into this game and said, listen, Traveris Ward, you've taken 14 out of this game. Again to the outside, and that's hauled in by their marquee. Goodwin who makes his first catch of the game. A guy who was in the long jump in the London Olympics back in 2012. Great speed and a good job that time by Juno Smith. Juno Smith gets that ball out quickly before Nick Bosa could hit him. Through the middle. Up the middle. Travis Homer. Short gain there. Clock ticking down. Each team with all of its timeouts. 2nd and 6 Homer loses it picked up on a hop and on his way to various ward out of bounds at the 5 yard line Al you told me you called a game between these two teams and Drake Greenlaw made a play at the one-yard line. This could be another one of those kind of plays where Ward hits him, and then Greenlaw again with a big play against his Seahawk offense late in the first half. Jars that ball loose with that big hit, and then right into the hands of Chavarius Ward. Boom. Yeah, Greenlaw made that play at the end of the 19th season, final play of the game against San Francisco, and that was the difference between being the one seed and the five seed. and then once he led to the Super Bowl. Something about playing here and playing against his rival brings out the best in Dre Greenlaw. So first and goal, after the fumble, more of the six. They have all of their sideouts. McCaffrey, fighting his way, stopped a little shy of the goal line. Second down and goal. And the 49ers, who deferred winning the opening toss, have a chance for that old two-for-one here. Timeout taken. Seattle will take that. Trying to conserve some time on the clock if they can. Back to the Greenlaw play. Again, we talked all night about the linebacker play and how quickly they close in on throws in front of them. Fred Warner gets most of the attention, but Drake Greenlaw is just as effective. If they're not able to make the play in coverage, they're able to close in on it, and they come in with bad intentions and jar that ball loose. And the way they swarm to the ball, when the ball's on the ground, one of the white jerseys is going to pick it up. And run with it. That was the case there. McCaffrey into the end zone. He goes for the touchdown. So the killer fumble leads to a touchdown. And as we say, they're going to get the ball to start the second half. Last two plays just going back to old reliable, which is his offensive line, which has become a real strength. Purdy hands it to McCaffrey who's again never going to be a guy that's going to come up short with the ball at the one yard line between the surge and then his vision and leg strength. That's a touchdown. Robbie Gold in his 18th season in the league. Kicking as well as ever. 14-3 and we're back here in 30 seconds. Law played. Coming here at the end of the 19th season. Final game of the year on a Sunday night. Winner of the game is the number one seed of San Francisco. Otherwise, they would have been the fifth seed. A gigantic difference. Here it is again. Russell Wilson back to throw. And the tackle is made just shy of the goal line. You're talking about you play 16 games back there, 17 games, and it comes down to a yard. The difference between a one and a five seed. And the one seed gets a bye and two home games. The five seed gets, in all likelihood, three road games. And off they went to play game. And that pass is incomplete. And it was tipped there as well. Nick Bosa got a hand on it. And, boy, the Seahawks are going to have quite a time with that defensive line of San Francisco tonight. I think Marquise Goodwin is saying, I'm glad that Nick Bosa got a hand on that because if he caught that ball, Fred Warner was getting ready to come in and it would have been another big loss. So this offense is out of rhythm. Give all the credit to the 49ers defense. Michael Dixon, third punt. As loud as there, calls for. and makes his third fair catch and also was contacted. And thus the flag, Joey Blunt, made contact with him after the fair catch. And for the first time tonight, we'll hear from the referee, Alex Kemp. Fair catch interference, picking team number 35. The 15-yard penalty, first down. Terry Mahoney says he likes it Terry does, we do too Back in 30 seconds The sound really stays in As you can tell, your first game here I can feel it Even though the 49ers are Starting to maybe take some shots Of taking this crowd out of it This is a big possession for the Seahawks defense 30-6 out of 6 Fives time Finds McCaffrey And he gets taken down immediately there by Maffei after a short game. There is Geno Smith. He's got two rookie tackles. You've got the left tackle is Charles Cross, pick number nine overall, and Abe Lucas was picked in the third round. They've actually played really well this year, but it's a different task tonight against this Niners defense. Second down and nine. That's caught. Brandon Ayuk with Devo Samuel out. Ayuk will probably see more action. He's a guy who has kind of been up and down in his career. But the guy of Shanahan still has a ton of faith in him. Well, Iyuk is a dangerous threat. He will get more opportunities. Ray-Ray McLeod as well, I think, physically will be in the lineup a lot more until Debo Samuel is able to get back in. But what a big loss not having him. He does so much with this offensive style. Third and six. He's nine for nine. He's pretty. Ray-Ray McLeod with a flag down. In the offensive backfield, here's Alex Kemp. Offense number 6-9. The 10-yard penalty. Third ball. Right tackle is Mike McGlinchey. The foul is on him. Daryl Taylor's get-off here. He's known as a pass rusher. Watch how quickly he gets off the ball. McGlinchey has to get out there to try to get to him. With that quick first step, able to almost get around the corner, made McGlinchey have to grab on there and hold it. First penalty on the 49ers. Little over a half minute to play in the quarter. Third down and 16. 30. Hits McCaffrey. And he takes it to the 47 of Seattle. Well short of the first down. Tariq Willem, the good looking rookie. Out of Texas, San Antonio. Makes a stop. And the 49ers want to be able to go for here have one more play They line up at least to try to get Seattle to go offside as the seconds tick down here But Alex camp and his crew is holding things up right now meanwhile They do get an offside. It's Darrell Taylor who comes across the line was it before the clock ran out and also if it's offside It's fourth down and seven which you make it fourth down and two Unbelievable. I mean, you knew they were just trying to do that hurry up near the end of the quarter to try to draw off a defender, and sure enough, Taylor, who just had that quick get-off, he tries to do it again, and I wonder if they may have... Super Bowl in a fraction. Defense number 52. Five-yard penalty. Four-pack. So the clock shows all zeros, but he came... He got through Charles Cross, the rookie left tackle, who's done a really good job tonight for the most part. You always know that Bosa, whether he's going to work around you, he's a technician, works with the hands. This time it's power, and I think it's the way he finished the play is what brought the flag. It's Niners defense, anticipating throws, they jump routes. Lenore, who has stepped in well for Mosley this year with that injury. But yeah, finishing it right there to the ground is why he got the call. That's four roughing the passer penalties on Bosa this season On the flip side Tie for the league lead and sacks with 14 and a half Pressure again Escapes for the moment Fires, finds the open man, it's Lockett Flag is thrown on that play Up near where the catch was made Back of a job by Geno Smith to keep that play alive T.Y. McPhil got right in pocket. Illegal contact. Defense number 38. Penalties declined. First down. So that's Lenore who thought he had a touchdown for a moment. Now the flag. T.Y. McGill as soon as the ball is snapped, look how quickly he's in there. Just step up. Use his leg strength to pull out of that potential sack and then keeps his vision downfield and finds Lockett. Walker. And bottling him up tonight in this last week's game against Carolina. Came back with that ankle. Eight carries for him for only 22 yards, though. You know, this team started 6-3. They've lost three of their last four. And a lot of that has to do with they've gotten into obvious passing situations. And now, down like this, they're kind of back into that familiar territory. There is Metcalf. Short game. Setting up another third down. So they're 1-7. Pete talking about it at halftime. Got to convert on third down. Yeah, and now you're down 18. It's third and fourth down. They're going to start to get into those situations. Metcalf again continues to get into that battle with Traverius Ward. Corman Rush. Caught. So they convert up at the 24-yard line. That's Tyler Lockett. Pulling it in there. Gaining eight yards. They motioned over Goodwin. And it moves to safety that time. Gibson to be able to create some room to be able to throw right here to Lockett. Good job by Lockett is setting that route up on Jimmy Ward. Being patient. And there's the eyes. Works from his left back to his right. and then finds Lockett, and they're able to convert their second of the night on third down. See the numbers on Smith who leads the league in completion percentage. He's right up around that figure right now, 19 of 27. He's 71% on the year. Going deep into the corner and making the grab at the two-yard line. They flag. What else is there? There's another flag. It's Derrick Young who calls it in at the tube, but the Niners are already celebrating, saying it's going to be against Seattle. And the right tackle. Lucas looked like he may have gotten a hold of the pass rush there. Grabbed on. Holding. Offense number 72. 10-yard penalty. First down. Exactly. A Bukam works outside and then goes to the inside. And that inside move is where the rookie, again, loses leverage and grabs on. What an effort here by Young. Close. That wouldn't be one if they would have called that. They definitely had a review or a flag out. That was close. Seven infractions against Seattle. It would have been a 22-yard game. It's now first and 20. Smith to the outside Metcalf gets away for the moment picks up a couple of extra yards second down you got a wide nine here with Nick Bosa and the rookie sees look at him he's peeking out there knows how he's got to work to get out there in this matchup I mean all week long and he's done a great job this year You know, he's picked ninth overall. He knew when he went to this division, he thought, oh, boy. Rams, Niners, pass rush, Bosa, and now he's had a chance. There's moments ago, Kaylee with Pete Carroll. Coach, what does your offense need to do to find some rhythm? Yeah, we've got to get a third-down conversion. You know, we're not doing well on third down. We've got too many long ones. We've got to make better battles early down so we can get a better third-down situation. We won a seven in the first half. You told us that you needed to win games like this to have a successful season. And what did you tell your team at the half? This game is ready to be won. We've got to go out there and do it. It's going to take us a little bit. One series at a time. Great focus and finish this thing off. Get a great win here. So true. They are one of seven on third down. So the Niners start here from the 41-yard line. McCaffrey. And he'll roll for five yards. Jefferson makes the tackle there McCaffrey now 14 carries for 62 on the ground Love Pete Carroll optimism right I mean he down 14 We right where we want This is where we want. This is what we work for. This is our opportunity. He's 71. They say 70 is the new 60, which you don't believe to begin with. For him, 70 is like the new 30. I was going to say, he's 71 going on 41. Right. tons of energy a lot of fun to watch second down and five from the 46 yard line 30 great protection and wide open this kettle roaming free Diggs can't take him down nobody else can and it's a touchdown 54 yards Cards. Wide, wide open along the sideline. Al, you'll like this even more. And Mosu, known as a pass rusher, watch what happens with Purdy. He looks to the right. He wants to throw the slant. Mosu drops. So he comes back all the way to his left. Busted coverage. And because he's able to work through those progressions with great time, he finds who else? George Kittle, who knows how to make people miss, let alone when you bust in coverage like this. He's going to find a way to get that football into the end zone. A minute in to the second half. Gold for the extra point. And it's 21-3. Birdie with two touchdown passes tonight. Holly Collinsworth got us up there one night. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. How was it? Fun. Cold. Good fun. Back we go to the touchdown. We're trying to figure out, okay, Kittle gets open. You got Irvin right here who rides him for a little bit. And then the middle linebacker, I think Jordan Brooks. Everybody else is playing man to man. Woolen's playing man. Neal's playing man. And the linebacker doesn't run with George Kittle. So a mix-up in coverage and a great job again by the rookie, Purdy, of working from his right, coming all the way back to see that breakdown and capitalizing on it. Kidd plays a poise, man. Kidd with the longest touchdown by a tight end in the NFL this season. Starts this drive through the Hawks with a four-yard gain by Walker. I think that's the thing everybody wanted to see with this 49ers offense on the road, in this environment, a chance to clinch the division. Tough defense, tough atmosphere, rival game. How would this quarterback react? And so far in this offense, he doesn't have to be a savior. He just has to be efficient and smart and distribute, and he's doing it. To the outside. And run under bounds after a short game there. He's Noah Fant by Lenore. It'll be third down. And when in doubt, you rely on this defense, right? the way these guys run to the ball. Tonight, Seattle's won 34 plays for only 118. Take a look at that. In the second half, 14 points allowed in six games. All wins. Third and eight. Here they come. pressure picked off the Amador Lenore but a flag is thrown and Lenore for the moment takes it into the end zone Smith hit as he threw it they celebrate but it's all about the call from Alex Kemp. Bosa got to him. Ruffing the passer. Defense number 97. The 15-yard penalty in the previous spot and a first down for sure. That erases it. In front. Good job by Kittle getting that separation. Tries to fight back to get that football, but Neal close enough to pull it out. Sikerti started 11 for 11. Now he's missed on his last three. Going for 98 yards. Second down and Ten. Flag. And for the moment, about a seven-yard gain before he is run out of bounds. Sure looked like Bruce Irvin got an early start there. He's prone to that. Offside. Defense number 27 lined up in the neutral zone. That's a five-yard penalty. Still second down. This time they called it on Wollin, the rookie corner. yeah he's trying to jam Kittle and gets across the line of scrimmage what a year he's had right you got Kobe Bryant as a rookie Wallen is a rookie there he is to the right well across the line of scrimmage this guy 6 4 2 10 as a rookie they had to be urban I mean they called it on and Pete Carroll ran down to say What was that called about? Second down and five. McCaffrey. He'll be stopped about a yard and a half shot. So the thing was, Woolen had been lined up in the neutral zone. Of course, that creates it. We were talking about Irvin. But Irvin loves to get that quick jump as well, and he did there as well. I know you love watching this rookie. We were talking with Sherm about his length and how effective he's been. It's just rare to see a corner in the NFL at 6'4". Except maybe you come to Seattle after what Richard Sherman did. Six picks this season. As fast as they come. On third and short, that's a first down for McCaffrey. Up to the 38-yard line. And he goes with 320 left in the opening half. Wouldn't be surprised if you go back to what was working early. And that's relying on this offensive line. The right tackle, Mike McClinchey, doing a good job here on third down and short 69. Nice job of kind of shouldering that outside end and then working down to be able to give McCaffrey the room that he needs. McCaffrey, 10 carries, 50 yards. To the outside. Short game. There's the defensive coordinator, Clint Hurt. Been around a long time as an assistant coach. You've got a new offensive coordinator, a new defensive coordinator, new quarterback, two new tackles. Waldron here last year had been on the staff. Ken Norton was the defensive coordinator last season. Second down and nine. McCaffrey taken down at the 36-yard line. And Wosso makes the stop there. That takes us to the two-minute warning. Third and 11 when we come back for the 49ers. Part of the Legion of Boom. Meanwhile, that's almost intercepted right into the hands of Quandre. Diggs could not hold on, and it's fourth and 11. Here's a rare mistake that we've seen from Purdy. He telegraphs this pretty good. Here's the safety, Diggs, who's a ball hawk. You go back and look at the 12 interceptions since 2020. Just reads the eyes, and Purdy brings him over on that vertical route down the middle to Jennings. just doesn't come up with the interception. So, Birdie catches a break, but Diggs a good job of baiting him and reading the eyes. Ha, ha, ha. Richard saying, he can't do that. Wisnowski's punt. Fair catch goal for, made at the 19-yard line by Tyler Lockett. Holiday cheer included with Prime. Now streaming brand new movies like something from Tiffany's and more family classics. Prime Video. All of your holiday needs. See where it takes you. Prime Video. Middle of December. How did we get to the 15th of December? This flew by. Yeah. Richard Sherman down on the field. I know we would love to see a pick there by Diggs, but he's got to love the matchup with Metcalf going against Ward and how physical that has been. So also forces him to step up into the pocket. Watch the pressure initially start out here with 10, who's their best edge pressure guy. Able to get away from Aaron Banks, force them into the pocket. And that's where Jefferson is able to come up with a sack. Third and 15. Come up in a tight formation over the middle. That is caught there by McLeod, and Ray-Ray McLeod is going to pick up the first down. Over the middle on such a key play for the defense, third down and 15. And this is just get the ball to a playmaker in space. This is usually Debo Samuel, right? But here you have Ray-Ray McLeod. You got Kittle out in front of him. Kittle helps, tries to help out, but this is really about space and about Ray-Ray McLeod being able to work. He's known as a punt returner, a kickoff returner. Same thing here. Just dumping to him on third and long and let him outrun Woolen to get the first down. Niners are so good, as you know. Yards after the Cacks. They're always leading the league in that department. Example right there. Ball at midfield. And Purdy goes down. A flag goes down as well. Purdy gets back up. Purdy throws. And it's in the cloud. And we'll see what the call is from Alex Kemp. In the formation. Offense. There's no eligible receiver on the right side of the formation on the line. It's a five-yard penalty. Still first down. Talking about yards after the catch. so from 2018 on first and they lead this year and of course you got Debo Samuel has a lot to do with that of course and and now that he is out others will have to to pick it up we saw Kittle make some plays McCaffrey obviously IU cast potential huge check they can use a lot of guys first and 15 Purdy throws and that's caught and that'll pick up 12 of those 15 yards to Jawan Jennings making it second down and short Jackson and Bryant in on the stop second and three I think it's a combination of John Lynch and Kyle Shanahan finding the right personnel to fit their scheme but it's also the quarterback understanding the difference between man and zone. When they throw the ball in zone, they try to throw it in an area where the receiver can catch the ball and run after the catch just using his momentum. Cooper Cupp, the best in the NFL at doing that. Second down and three. McCaffrey, nothing doing there. Defense is right there to stop him. Miles Adams, number 95, grabbed him. Third and five. You think about how bad this defense looked last week against Carolina, against the run, especially in the fourth quarter. And you look at the way they played tonight against, I think, a better offensive line and obviously a better running back to McCaffrey. And for the most part, they've held up. Like, if you would have said, hey, you get near the end of the third quarter and the 49ers have 71 yards rushing, you'd say, you know what, they're probably in the game. Yeah, for sure. Third and five. Can they get to Purdy? They cannot. The pass is incomplete. The cloud looks for a flag and does not get one, and it's fourth and five. That's just good coverage downfield. Purdy had plenty of time. Good job of recognizing routes underneath. Linebackers, you see the rookie Kobe Bryant here underneath. And then you got Jordan Brooks who picks up that crosser. So good job of leveraging that potential check down there by Purdy. Lockett stands back there inside his 10-yard line. Wisnowski. Four punks tonight. They've averaged 42 yards per boot. Lockett will let it bounce. And the 49ers will down it at around the 3-yard line. George Odom is right there. 21-6 San Francisco. Two and a half to go in the third. Be a big part as they move forward. And it's a young team, very much building for the future. They start this drive back at the four-yard line. And Smith buys some space. So, like, meanwhile, Russell, three and nine. Kansas City in the Super Bowl. Ten-yard line. Ligue 1-1. Ligue 1-3. Bring it back out to the 30. A little strum develops. 41 seconds. Think about the swing of things that just happened there. You know, the interception. I mean, if Diggs comes up with this ball, he's already at midfield. I mean, who knows if he's able to pick up a few yards and then to not come up with the interception. And then you give the ball right back after the turnover and the Niners are able to capitalize. What a swing and a difference here at the end of this first half. And have the fleeting if you're on the other end of it. From the 30. From behind, pressure is put on it. Somehow up in the air with a flag coming in at the end is Metcalf. And now they're going to say, one official saying incomplete. There's a flag down at the 45-yard line. Alex Kemp's going to tell us Offense number 14 Again these two have been going at it I thought Metcalf grabbed the jersey The back of the jersey award To pull himself up Once he got into the air Before he goes into the air See how he pulled on it That's what I think And I think that's what the officials must have seen Good job by the officials Of catching that right hand by Metcalf to get up and over Ward. That's Metcalf's third offensive pass interference penalty of the season. Rock it. He gets banged out of bounds, and you've got 28 seconds. Lenore with a stop. Yeah, they'll just continue to rush for, sit back in zone, keep everything in front of them, which is their M.O. anyway. That's who they are, prevent the big play, and then rally to the football in front of them. Short pass here. Penny Hart makes the grab. And timeout is taken here at 21 seconds. This has been a fun matchup to watch. In many cases, Traverius Ward has followed D.K. Metcalf. and I don't even care if it's just he's blocking. I mean, every single play, these two have been going at it and welcoming the challenge. It's been a physical battle, especially in coverage. Officials are letting him play with the exception of Metcalf grabbing the jersey. But, man, I think D'Amico Ryans must have said that you're very important. This is why we brought you here. You're a difference maker. We have now a corner. You go take 14 and shut him down tonight. And that's what he's done holding him a couple of grabs third down and four We set the clock at 25 seconds And underneath and that's not going to do very much in the crowd gets frustrated Walker makes the catch there. It's gonna be fourth down Just a kid that the speed of this defense It's just incredible. And if I'm San Fran, I call a timeout. And there you are. They've got all three left. Yeah, you put yourself in a box there right now. It's fourth down. You can't go for it. You don't make it. A field goal for San Francisco would make it a 14-point lead right now. It's 11. And they have to punt. How about when we asked Bosa on our call, you know, about the hustle of this defense and how they run to the ball. and he kind of, I said, do you guys make fun of each other and film? You know, he goes, listen, if you don't run to the ball, you're going to look like an idiot because everybody else has run into the ball and kind of take pride in it. So it's by intent the way they draft and the type of personalities they bring on to this defense. Don't get called for what Rob Marinelli used to call a low, that's blocked field goal return in the game in Santa Clara. A kneel down will end the first half here. So the 49ers trying to make it seven straight. Trying to clinch a playoff spot. Head to the locker room with the score. San Francisco 14. And a big game for them tonight. Huge game. Yeah, huge game and a big start to this second half for Pete Carroll and the Seahawks in this defense. See if they can get the Niners off the field. From the two-yard line. McLeod. Not past the 30. Taken down at the 40-yard line by Myers. Would be tackled by Ryan Neal. I'd love to see him as a young guy slide right here. Just get down. The game would be over. But instead, he's trying to get the ball that he end zone. Yeah. And you understand that being a young guy. He sees that goal line, and he wants to get his touchdown. And then they'll just take a kneel down here and wind up winning the game by eight and going to the playoffs. All right, your summation of Brock Purdy tonight. Didn't turn the football over, which is the most important thing in this offense. Again, I thought the poise that he plays with is the thing that stands out. The operation, no delay of games, no turnovers. It's just the look on his face. It's not too big. And he knows where his checkdowns are. He knows where the answers are. I love the kid. And it's just remarkable that he's a rookie and playing the way he is, and especially tonight on the road in this atmosphere. He said it perfectly. It just doesn't look too big for him on any level. And it hasn't since he got into the game against Miami when Garoppolo got hurt. Last week he looked terrific. Tonight he looks fine. Better than fine. And they are the Western Division champions. So the 49ers win it by a score of 21-13, dealing a major blow to Seattle's playoff hopes along the way. 49ers, NFC West champions, and a seven-game winning streak. Google Pixel postgame show. Johnson, who's been with like 100 different teams over the last 14 years, he would have been the guy. Well, that's where they are now. There's a look at Johnson. The most important of all those numbers, I know you're a big QB rating guy. So, yeah. The most important are the zeros under interceptions last week and tonight. No doubt. Second and ten. We'll explain that QBR thing to you someday. Through the middle, up to the four-yard line, goes Christian McCaffrey. And I know that's important in any offense, but especially as good as this defense is. Again, I keep saying it. Yeah, he's doing a great job. It's been impressive, his preparation. But Kyle Shanahan builds a quarterback-friendly offense around the running game. And he gives the quarterback a chance to get the ball out quickly and be decisive, first or second option, let the athletes do all the work after the catch. Just don't lose the game at quarterback. Hold them here and they should wind up with decent field position after a punt. Key, key play. Third and seven. And that's going to be caught and that's going to be a first down up to the 15-yard line. Jawan Jennings. Huge play. On the road. Rookie. Everybody wants to know how good are the 49ers without Jimmy. Can this rookie do it? Double slant. Good read. The rookie Bryant 8 takes inside with Ray Ray McLeod. And how about the poise? Standing in his own end zone. Crowd as loud as it's ever been tonight. And he throws an absolute dart to Johnson for the first down. 30-16 and 22. Throwing for 189. McCaffrey. Bouncing away and just barely gets back to the line of scrimmage. And Wosu having a heck of a game tonight. He is a guy that they brought over from the Chargers, and he is known for his ability to rush the quarterback. He's going up against George Kittle. Look at that extension. Sets the edge, forces McCaffrey back the other way. Great job, man. Playing great tonight. Second and ten. 30. Low. Incomplete. Trying to get it to McCaffrey. It'll be third down and ten with 10.50 left in the fourth. Doing a much better job, even without Jordan Brooks in, the starter, and kind of the quarterback of this defense. Tanner Muse has stepped up. He's a former safety out of Clemson who's moved to backer. And he and Cody Barton underneath there, anticipating the potential of McCaffrey out of the backfield. And again, one had him to the left, one had him to the right. Nothing that Purdy could do except throw that away. And you saw Brooks still out of the game. They're leading tackler. Third down and ten. And that's pretty clear right there. That's Trent Williams. All-star offense number 71. Five-yard penalty. Third down. He's as good as a guest once in a while and makes a mistake. I'm going to tell you. Yeah, top left tackle in the game by many people's estimation. 13th year. He's given up one sack on the year. I mean, just a punishing run blocker. That time, the crowd. Like I said, it's the loudest. I feel like you told me how loud it is. I can feel it now. I see what you're saying. Oh, yeah. They bring it. They bring it every time the Seahawks are in action here. Third down and 15 from the 10th. Four-man rush. Purdy has to spin away. It's out of the end zone. Little dump off there. And out of bounds of the 17 is Ray Ray McLeod. So they do what they have to do after they gave up that third down completion to get them out of the shadow of their own end zone. Fourth and nine, and they'll get the ball back. This is how you do it when you don't have to blitz. and Miles Adams going to the top there, just pushes the rookie, Spencer Burford, right into the backfield. Rushing four, flushed him out of the pocket. That ball's incomplete. It is. Going to get great field position. Or should. So now you've got Carroll seeing the replay. It was third and 15, so they called it a completion. Ruling on the field was a complete pass. Seattle has challenged that ruling. Yeah, and they should win that. And that would negate a six-yard gain and make it fourth and 15. So they'll still have to kick when we come back. But Carroll should win this one. The Jaguars are very much in contention to win that AFC South with Tennessee having its problems right now. Meanwhile, the Jets trying to get into the playoffs as well. Jaguars, Jets next Thursday night. And the Jags and the Titans, I think, finish up at the end of the regular season. These next few weeks are big for both of those teams. Nothing determined yet. Pushed Natsuki, not a punt. Fourth and 15. Pretty big. You know, six yards back. You're trying to get the ball near midfield to give Geno Smith a chance to get it within a possession. So the right challenge there by Pete Carroll, and it pays off. And the key thing, it doesn't cost you time out. He's got all three coming down the stretch. Tyler Lockett is back to receive, standing at midfield. Lockett calls for, makes the fair cash at the 46-yard line. Well, for a quarter century now, the Allen family has owned the team. Paul Allen bought it back in 97. There's Jody Allen and his sister. Paul died in 2018. Tremendous major philanthropist. There's been a lot of talk about the Seahawks have to sell the team at a certain point. And it is my understanding there is no specific timeline. It'll be up to Jody to determine if and when this team does get sold. Meanwhile, it's been a very solidly run franchise for 25 years. They had Mike Holmgren for 10. They've had Pete Carroll for the last 13. They've been to three Super Bowls. Stadium is filled every time they play here as Geno Smith backs away. Look out and gets it away before he gets creamed. This will be interesting. See if the officials come together on this. I don't know if there was an intended target there. Walker was probably the closest. Yeah. Intentional grounding. Offense number seven. Ball is placed with a spot on a foul. He wants to down. He'll be second down. I don't think he got out of the pocket. By the way, they have their backup defensive line in right now. And you see the rookie, Drake Jackson, to the far right. Yeah, he's still within the pocket. And then just kind of no man's land. Just throws it and gets rid of it. There's Jackson, 95. It's one thing that Tomiko Ryans does. They'll use those backup defensive linemen, try to stay fresh, try to keep Bosa and that first group healthy and ready to go. And Terry Hyder, Jordan Willis, a couple of the guys. That cost him 13 and the down. Meanwhile, that is incomplete. Even had it been complete, it would have been good for nothing. Kenneth Walker, the intended receiver. Smith wanted a flag, doesn't get it. Third and 23. That was a combination. And, again, Ryan talks about this, the front and coverage working as one. And we're going to hold up on the back end. We're going to give you more time to be able to get there. And that was a great example of that. Playing zone. Just nowhere to go with the ball. 30-23. 49er defense talking about the job that D'Amico Ryans has done with this stellar group. And again, very little doubt in anybody's mind right now. If you know this guy around the league, the respect that he has, he should get the resume ready, or at least ready for the talking points in the interview. He played the game at a high level, and then he's transitioned in as an assistant and a coordinator at a superior level, and you look at his pedigree and the people he's been around. He played for Nick Saban in college, and now you look at what he doing here and just an impressive guy By the way some guys look like head coaches Yes He looks like a head coach Yeah we asked Bosa about him the other day Does he have what it takes to be a head coach He says he's great the way he addresses the whole team. Third down and 23. Chased again. A little sideways flip by Lava Holmes. But for next to nothing, Greenlaw is right there to take Homer down his fourth and a mile. figure out the rookie here in this second half gave him a combination of moves started to kind of see how he would react react and now it's just the hands I mean his hand you know the thing about him you look at him and he's so physically imposing but he and his brother both it started back in college at Ohio State with Larry Johnson how they worked on the technique and understanding their craft and he continues to raise the bar in that area it's in that sprinter stance off the edge Second and ten. To the outside goes the throw. And taken out of bounds there. Marquise Goodwin. And they can now say that's incomplete. And Goodwin says, huh? That ball came out. Good discussion here with the officials. 49ers say new. That's why you finish the play as a corner. See the ball fly in the air here. Let's see if it's considered a catch. Can't wait to bring Terry in on this one. There's the ball. Terry, what do you think of that? That's a catch, Kirk. He gets two control, two feet down, and he takes an additional step. Got it. They have now re-ruled it a completion. So they get it right at the end, and it's third down and four. And now you've got a... Kyle's got his flag in his hand. Oh, Shanahan. On the field is a complete pass. San Francisco has challenged that ruling. All right, they want to go back to the original ruling. After review, it is a complete catch. The ruling on the field stands. San Francisco will be charged with a timeout, and that's their first challenge of the game. So it'll be third down and four after all that, a minute into the fourth quarter. At the San Francisco 35-yard line. Third down back, Travis Palmer. In the game. Goes to his lineup wide again. Look out, and Geno Smith goes down at the 45-yard line. Again, that intense pressure all night long from that defensive front. How about this little wrinkle here by D'Amico Ryans where he puts three on the right side and then he's going to use another twist here. He's been doing it a lot with Armstead. This time Armstead works to the outside. You see the pressure there by a Bukam ends up getting in there and Geno Smith just kind of gives up there in the pocket before he gets hit. Just collapsed on him. McCom gets credit for the sack there. So Dixon has to come in to punt for the sixth time in the game. Let it bounce. And they'll pin him at the one. That's what life's about, right? You hit a home run on that every week. Trying to stay off social media and not get on it. Amen. Jordan Brooks is out of the game at the moment. We saw him being worked on on the sideline. 49ers pin deep at their own one-yard line. Tandoning takes the spot of Brooks for the moment. That's Tiff. Incomplete. Second and ten. trying to take advantage of this. Adams, 95, who's not played a ton tonight, put a good job there. Only 6-2. Goes up and is able to knock that down. You know, special teams did their job. They put Purdy in this offense at the one-yard line. If they want to get back into this game, they've got to take advantage of this. Absolutely. Two minutes into the fourth. Of course, it's even louder when we get down in the end zone territory. Second and ten. And a timeout taken by San Francisco. It was so loud. Clock running down. They take a timeout. They've already lost one challenge. They're down to their final challenge. Meanwhile, Purdy, the last two games, those numbers right there. And, of course, coming into the game, Kirk, the question was, What about that rib issue? You know, he was even being questioned as the starter tonight, and they had brought in Josh Johnson in Denver. You got the difference here. Wilson with about a 2-1 touchdown interception ratio. Geno at 3-1, and Geno's rating well above the league average. Second down and three. That's caught up at the 17 by 5. Meanwhile, among all the other things, the Seahawks have had rookies take the second most snaps in the league. Only the Texans have rookies taking more snaps than these guys. So it's a young team. Yeah, and really on both sides of the ball, like you said. In the secondary, in critical areas, too. Walker. You've got both your tackles. You've got a running back that's involved. I mean, those are three big positions that you'd like to try to hit. And then you look in that secondary with Wolin and Kobe Bryant. Right there, it's five or six guys that have been able to walk in here and be major contributors. Love how this team's not giving up. You know, they've had a rough month the last four games. Down 21-6 to me, maybe the best team in the league. one of the best. And they'll keep fighting. Here's Walker. And again, such an important game for them to really, you know, kind of not be dead in the playoff hunt, but to stay alive. Give themselves a decent chance. Right now, a half game out of that last spot. And of all things, they have to go to Kansas City next week. Yikes. Yeah. Not good. Come home against the Jets and the Rams here in the last two games of the season. Third and two. That's Brooks being worked on on the sideline. The linebacker. Smith. Oh, she's there, but he gets away from him. Flag is thrown. Another flag is thrown. And a third flag is thrown. This is all sending the laundry out here. with 17 seconds left in the quarter. Our guy Charles Cross got into it there with Nick Bosa. It's been a battle. This play is kind of representative of the night. So they sort out three penalties. there were three fouls on the play, all by the defense, all of which will be declined. Holding, number 57. Holding, number 7. Iliusa hands to the face. Number 97. They're all declined. The result of the play is the first down. You heard the last one that he called. It was on Bosa, and it's against Cross. We keep going back to this one-on-one battle, and been talking about how the rookie's been holding his own, but it's a tough thing to do, especially when Bosa gets his hands up into your face. Terry, you've reffed a lot of games. I've seen a lot of games. I can't remember ever seeing three fouls on the defense on one play. Can you? Terry's going no. Here's Lockett. Up to the 43-yard line, he goes, and that takes us to the end of the quarter. Stick around to see something for the first time every Thursday night. 21-6 San Francisco as we go to the fourth. Down and two for Seattle from their own 44-yard line. Walker to the outside. It's around the corner. Nice run. First down. Nick Bosa this time shoots a gap to the inside, and it frees up the edge here. Good recognition of that by Kenneth Walker right there. He's got that lateral quickness, and I'll tell you what, you underestimate his speed. He's got long speed. I mean, he can bounce it. He's quick. But if he turns the corner, he can go to the house. Lockett is in motion Smith under pressure again And that is tipped and incomplete It's Bosa putting the heat on Second and ten I think Bosa's starting to McCaffrey, it becomes a foot race And he gets the first down and stays inbounds A great heads up play there by the rookie I think Carroll's going to challenge the spot And that's where he starts the slide That's true. The ruling on the field is that the quarterback made the line of game. Seattle has challenged that ruling. So Pete has that challenge. The other problem he's got here, that's his last time out if he loses this challenge. Terry, what are you seeing? Al, when he goes down on his own like this, the ball is placed at its foremost point when a body part other than his hand or foot touches. So you're looking for when that knee goes down. Where's the ball when the knee goes down? This is a first down. Yeah, right there. And Terry, really a heads-up play of extending the ball, right? I mean, if he keeps that ball up close to his stomach, that ball maybe comes back and maybe he is short. Exactly, Kirk. It's the foremost point of the ball when the knee touches it. He got it out there beyond the line of the game, first down. Yeah, so they're going to lose the challenge, lose the timeout. They'll have none. The clock will only stop at the two-minute warning, and they can take it pretty close to the end. That's where his feet come into play. You know, like... You know, I love Jimmy Garoppolo, but I think one of the areas that Purdy gives you just that added dimension is that play right there. Like I said, he comes around in that naked. The Russo takes McCaffrey, no problem. Foot race to the corner, get the first down. If he would have taken him, you can flip it. So that's an added element with his footwork. and quickness that he brings to this offense. Final pick in the draft. Seventh quarterback picked in the draft. And on the verge of taking his team into the playoffs. Handoff here goes to Jordan Mason. Comes in the relief of McCaffrey. And that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. And a reminder to stay tuned after the game, the Google Pixel postgame show exclusively on Prime Video. Marissa will wrangle up the guys to wrap up the night, interviews with stars of the game, and then on the nightcap, TNF nightcap, the preview of Sunday's NFL slate. Speaking of that slate, you've got three games coming up on Saturday, highlighted by Miami at Buffalo at night. NFL Network has that at 8.15, expecting snow. Cowboys go to Jacksonville. Pretty interesting, little things considered. Trevor Lawrence playing well last week, obviously, with Cowboys red hot. Bengals red hot, taking on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Sunday on CBS. And then the Sunday night game is the Giants. And the Commanders with the same mark at 7-5-1 right now, both in position to get to the playoffs. So a big game there as well. But Cincinnati really seems to have settled in. We saw them early in the year against Miami. And like all great teams, they've kind of had to navigate some injuries and continue to find ways to win. But as long as Joe Burrow's back there at quarterback, they're always in it. You got it. Second down and five. Last gasp here for that Seattle defense. Ushak in at fullback. Mason is the running back. Here's Mason to the outside. He's going to get stopped but fights for an extra yard or so. So it's third down here. Third and three. You can take the clock down now to about a minute and ten or so. Geno Smith rolling for 238 tonight. So McCaffrey out for the moment. 108 yards for him tonight. Keep Mason in the game. Runs that play clock all the way down. Snaps it at two through the middle, and this ends the ball game right here as Mason takes off inside the 10 and gets bumped out of bounds at about the one-yard line. 56 yards. They bring the rookie back up in at a Georgia Tech, and he seals the deal. We keep telling you to keep this number in mind, number 24, as these games go on. Watch the left side of the offensive line, Banks and Williams. Williams gets up to the backer, And then he's able to shed that. Bosa's been on cross most tonight. So now the other rookie, Abe Lucas, he's going to get a taste of Bosa. You know, why not work on the other side? You see the tight end there helping just for a minute. And Abe Lucas is saying, wait a second. Where did this guy come from? I haven't had to see him all night. It's the beauty of bringing those backups in. Look at D'Amico Ryan's laughing and moving them around. Dixon's seventh punt, sky high fielded at the 14 with Loud and Double Ray takes it back out to the 22 with 9.5 to go in Seattle United's defense and how they swarmed at the ball look at yards after the catch 10 yards fewer than expected because of how tight this coverage is and not only the coverage It's how they run, the effort that they use to be able to get to the ball as a group. And if you look at this, eight games now that they've allowed fewer yards after the catch than expected. That's the best in the NFL, and I would challenge anybody. I know there's some good defenses out there. I don't know if at all three levels there's a defense that is as complete and disciplined and violent as this 49ers defense. Tell the Hawks to two field goals. Meanwhile, they can start playing a little clock ball here. McCaffrey takes it up to the 29-yard line. I'm sure Pete Carroll has challenged his defense. Remember last week, I think it was 15 of the last 17 plays. Carolina ran the football. Didn't even attempt just a couple passes and went from a 20-17 game to a 30-17. Just wore him down in the fourth quarter. Second down and four. nine minutes left in regulation Kittle in motion here goes McCaffrey all the way out to the 40 yard line talking about Pete Carroll what a run he said remember he's coached three teams now you forget he coached the Jets in 94 Patriots for three years now he's here in the middle of that SC did pretty well there He almost wound up with Kyle's father, Mike, back in 95. Mike was the offensive coordinator in San Francisco to win the Super Bowl. And Mike calls Carroll and says, I want you to be the defensive coordinator in Denver. He's going to take the job until George Shefford called. But he was in San Francisco and said, come here. And Pete's a native San Francistan. He decided to go home. That was great to talk to him. You brought that up to him on the field before the game, and he started to say, let me tell you the whole story, and just talking about how close it came between the two of them. But it was fun to go all the way back in his mind to 1995, and he said just his passion and love growing up in San Francisco. Ultimately, he had to take that one. He did, and that's when Ray Rhodes left as the defensive coordinator to go to Philadelphia. So Pete was there for a couple of years, and that led to the job in New England. And Robert Kraft said it's the hardest thing ever to do, fire him. But, of course, that's when he brought Belichick in. Everything works out in the end. I guess. Second down and six. Purdy. Wide open again. And this time it is Tyler Croft. Their number two or three tie then. And, again, he gets free, and that's 28 yards. Well, here's Kittle. So if anybody's going to slip out, it'd be him. But look at all the defenders expecting run. and then you just slide out the backup tight end, Croft, that nobody's expecting. Good job of selling it, and a great play call again. When everybody's thinking they're going to work clock, stay one step ahead of them, hit the play action to the tight end down the right sideline, and nobody's there. Pete Carroll called him a savant this week. He was effusive in his praise and what he does offensively. Of course, Mike had Kyle. He had Sean McVay. A lot of it goes back to Mike Shanahan. Everybody's talking about coaching trees and guys that leave as assistants. I'm with you. I think it all starts at all. Start with Mike Shanahan, the job that he did in Denver. Remember Alex Gibbs, his own running scheme that he brought in. Now everybody does it. Kyle's got his own tree starting Mike McDaniel in Miami Who was he fighting over the other day? Matt LaFroix I'll give you that in a second 21-6 McCaffrey He's kind of kidding around We were saying Hey look Your tree is getting to be like this After this game on the road Yeah Third and six And that's incomplete You cannot handle it I mean, that would be the question, but the defense is fantastic. I know that. They have the offensive pieces. They're going to get Debo Samuel back at some point. By the way, how about this throw? Bang. Right there. Ayuk is a sure-handed guy. He's going to usually make this catch. I think he's running into the middle. He started to peek and look to see who might be closing in on him. But a great throw again by Brock Purdy. Next-gen stats powered by AWS. Make probability 67%. Robbie Gold, 43 yards. And so much for that. Yep. 67% good. 33% bad. Mini Kaibosh. Very, very mini. 21-6. Hand runs. It's complementary to his defense. and I think there's more margin of error because of how good you are on defense and you can run the ball and you don't have to win it on offense. Smith gets it to Metcalf and that should be enough for the first down as they hurry up to the line. From the 43-yard line, they actually called it a little short So it's second and one, and they still need to convert here because that's incomplete. Ibukam put the heat on. It's third down and one. Ibukam and Bosa have switched spots. We saw that on the last series, and it continues here. And now he's working up against 67 cross. It's a very different look. You know, you get used to Bosa the whole game, and I love how D'Amico Ryans will kind of mix it up and uses more speed. Doesn't come up with a sack, but definitely impacts the throw there by Geno Smith. So, Carroll on the sideline. I think what he was saying to the officials, hold on a second, on the Metcalf catch, wasn't that a first down? Instead, they marked it a little short. Now they're in a third and one. Former Ram, Ed McCom, comes off the field. By the way, they came in tonight without Hassan Ridgeway, without Kevin Givens. I mean, they're beat up on this defensive line, but because of how much they've invested in this defensive line, they've got depth. We saw Armstead out of the majority of this year, and others are able to emerge. I feel like it's the pride of this team is the defensive line. Walker spins away and is able to net that first down here. Clock down to four and a half. Quickly back to the line. Smith under pressure. That is caught along the sideline. And that's Lou Bisley making the grab and getting the first down. Down to four minutes we tick. It's like Janoris Jenkins is in on the other side where it's been Chavarius Ward. He is now matched up with D.K. Metcalf. Came close to deflecting that ball. And that's incomplete. Update on Ward. Kaylee, what do you know? Well, Al, he was evaluated for a concussion. The team tells us he has been cleared from that. But as you can see, he's not back in the game. He was in the medical tent for a considerable amount of time. It took the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant a while to look at that video review. But like I said, he has been cleared. Back on the bench, but Ken can get back in the game. Meanwhile, the pass is slow underneath to Walker with a ton of room. And Kenneth Walker will take the ball to the 10-yard line. Bufanga stopped him at that spot. When the crossers create some confusion, Number one, they blitz Fred Warner. Once he comes, there's no linebacker left there to pick up Kenneth Walker. And with all that space, man, he can pick up a lot of yards. Got 34 on that. Spotted at the 10. It's first down and goal. Smith hangs in there. Throw. Oh, for the touchdown. No offense. so the seattle seahawks taking over at their own 33 it takes them only 125 to go 67 yards and climb right back into it hufunga is safety he has his eyes more on locket and if he does the linebacker's got to carry fan so a bust on the back end you can see him right away hufunga he looks to the linebacker and says, wait a second, we're not on the same page. So a safety either needs to squeeze on that or a linebacker needs to run vertically and neither happens. Myers to make it a one-possession game, which he does with 3.35 remaining in the fourth. Still have the two timeouts and a two-minute warning. Just like that, isn't it? Yeah. We're in. These guys are a Super Bowl team we're thinking about next week. They clinched the division and Pete Carroll saying, let's go. Hey, we're getting used to fantastic finishes, aren't we? I mean, last week was ridiculous. That was in the Ram Raider game. I kept thinking about that all week. I'm going, did that really happen? So what happens down the street? We've talked about it. We talked about it at least at the beginning of the game. but some of the games these two teams have played over the last decade have just been fantastic. You've called a bunch of them. Yeah, that was part of the whole Sunday package for years. You get these two teams together, you could always count on something going on. Of course, Richard Sherman helped make something go on at the NFC Championship game with Michael Crabtree. Oh, yeah. It just seems like when they get together, especially here, and Seattle's had the upper hand, obviously. You go back over the years, but it always comes down to that last possession. So the 49ers guarding against the onside kick. But again, you've got 335. They've got the two timeouts. You have the two-minute warning. You try an onside kicker or just rely on your defense to stop him. And it's the latter as that bounce through the end zone. So now the 49ers trying to clinch the division, trying to cement a spot in the playoffs in at least one home game. Well, we keep talking about it as Super Bowl team or not. This is what great teams do, right? Under four minutes, you close it out. You pick up a couple first downs, you force the timeouts, and you win the game. So Purdy's numbers. Jennings sits up on the right side. McCaffrey with a good run. Christian out to the 26-yard line, and that takes him up and over 100. He has 105 yards tonight on 25 totes. And when you close a game out, you rely on that offensive line to whip those double, those combo blocks and get up to the backers. Keep in mind, Jordan Brooks, the leader, the number one tackler, the guy that's replaced Bobby Wagner, not in the lineup still with Tanner Muse and Cody Barton in the middle, which is a tough time late in the game not to have your alpha in there.

A little bit ago, we were told that he was questionable to return. That's his status being downgraded. But he has been on the sidelines, piping up his team and doing what he can from here. Yep. He's their leading tackler, but he's out right now. Hughes third and one. Rolling. Looking for the first down and getting it. Sliding. Marie started to slide past the line to game. Chased by Jefferson. First down. Coming off of this play action, you've got to read the in man on the line of scrimmage. and depending on what he does, you respond. Woosa's right here. If he takes the running back, then you run it. If he takes you, you flip it out. Now if he takes the receiver...
