 Four-time FCS national champion, two as a starter, two as a backup. Picked in the fifth round in 2019, and tonight, of course, is his first career start. Man, you know, can you imagine, you're sitting as, in effect, the number three quarterback for a lot of this time. You don't get into a game for almost five years. Meanwhile, the catch is made here on the outside, staying in bounds, picking up the first down, is Jalen Guyton. Bob shoves him away. Now I'm with you. I mean, think about this. His first four years with Tyrod Taylor first and then Chase Daniel, they were the backup quarterback to Justin Herbert. So he's basically the third guy, never active, never really thought about. And then he just keeps kind of in the shadows working to get better as a passer. He's a really athletic guy, really intelligent. And he got to the point where they were ready to make him the backup this year. And here he is making his first career start. Running back is Joshua Kelly. stick he can move throws, that's caught that's Everett making the catch and Everett gets out of bounds after he picks up a first down, kept it alive picks up the first to a certain degree you're going to have to have some backyard football tonight by stick it's his first career start and even though he's been in the league for five years you can see if his primary is not there here comes the rush and now you've got to be able to improvise and instead of throwing it away He keeps his eyes upfield and finds the tight end, Everett, who is blocking and ends up releasing. From the 48. On the ground. Stuffed. Kelly right there. Divine Diablo, middle backer, making the tackle, second down to 10. I know you and I and Kaylee were kind of taken back, and we did our Zoom this week with Easton Stick. And at the end, Kaylee asked him a question. besides your parents and your family, who's helped you the most. And he brought up his college coach, Chris Kleinman, who was at the time at North Dakota State. He's now currently the Kansas State head coach. And actually got emotional. Started to get teary-eyed and apologized. We said, hey, don't apologize. He said he instilled confidence in me as a freshman when I really needed it. And I'll never forget that. And it's cool that it impacts him all these years later. Second and 10. A shoulder shake. Look out. Ball is out. As they take him down to the 42-yard line. Raiders think they have it, and they do. Malcolm Koontz comes in, gets the sack, forces the fumble, and Las Vegas takes over. Tyree Wilson, rookie out of Texas Tech, with the recovery. They brought Spillane, 41 on the blitz, so that creates the one-on-one opportunity for Koontz, who, by the way, has just been getting better and better on the opposite side of Max Crosby. A lot of people worry about putting two blockers on Crosby for obvious reasons. 51, now has three sacks on the year. He has four tackles for a loss. It just seems to be all of a sudden, he has better technique. He's always been athletic. But Patrick Graham said, you know, he's bought into the technical aspect of being a pass rusher, and it's really paying off for him. Goons went to the same school that produced the Little Mac Buffalo. Not bad. Yep. So a little more than six minutes to play. There he is. forces the turnover. Meanwhile, after that perfect first drive, O'Connell comes back in. Picked him in the fourth round this year. Of course, it was going to be Jimmy Garoppolo who was going to be the guy. He was going to come to town and be the guy. He lasted about half a season. Zamir White is the running back. He gets it. Two-yard game. Khalil Mack in on that tackle. Michael Mayer just got introduced to Mack and how quick he is. It's one thing to study it and hear about it, but now you've got to try to block him on the outside, and he's gone. You can't even get your hands on him. Khalil Mack in his 10th year, I think he's having one of his best years he's had of his entire career. You think about getting into your 10th year, you're 32 years old, people start to think maybe you lose a little bit. In Khalil Mack's case, it's the opposite. If anything, he's gotten better. Playing against a team that drafted him. He played his first four years in Oakland, and that pass is incomplete. Intended for Devontae Adams. Michael Davis, who's kind of been in and out of the line. Meanwhile, Adams looking for a flag, doesn't get it. Davis, a starter, bench, starter again tonight. Been involved in a lot of the action already. Third down and eight. Yeah, people go after him. He's having a few words there with Adams as Adams was working the official. He's saying, hey, man, you've got to beat me. And one thing about Davis, he's got the length to be able to try to stay with him. And that was tight coverage on that back shoulder fade. He was right there stride for stride. Fantastic tonight. Memorial for Al Davis. Team coming from Oakland back in 2020. Mark Davis running the operation. Meanwhile, a punt here off the foot of J.K. Scott. and DeAndre Carter back to receive inside the 15-yard line. Fair catch called for, made at the 17-yard line. Kirk. Let's take a look at our high-performance 4K Sky Camp presented by BMW. We came in wondering how this offensive line, again, reshuffled. How would they hold up? How would they, without Josh Jacobs, would they be able to run the ball enough? Would they be able to hold up in pass protection against Mack? Remember, they had seven sacks, six by Mack alone. And so far, they are giving Aiden O'Connell time to be able to look downfield, make good throws. Been very accurate so far, and they've hit some big plays downfield. Something that has been missing for this offense. So 21 in the first quarter. And start here at the 18-yard line. They already have eight first downs and 141 yards. Hey, Monday, Monday. Monday, Monday. Three's the mic. Put it in. Put it in. Not much there. Hinton making the tackle on Zamir White. You know, Bo Hart agree, the offensive coordinator who took over as a play caller. By the way, first time in his career as a coach. You can imagine midseason trying to pick that up, but he's doing a heck of a job. He said the greatest thing that I feel like with Aiden O'Connell is that he handles everything at the line of scrimmage. And I thought that audio there, initially he called the mic nine, and then the defense moves around. He goes, check, check. Three's the mic. Three's the mic. So he's in command, and that helps the offensive line. See, there he is again, in command of this offense, helping that offensive line out. Three being Derwin James. Look out from behind. He's hit as he throws. That's on Khalil Mack. Almost had the sack. Chargers think maybe it's a fumble, but it's not. You know, you looked at Harding Green. And we talked about the fact they fired McDaniels, the head coach. They fired Mick Lombardi, the offensive coordinator. So Hardigree was the quarterback's coach. He's been calling the plays from the field. He's now upstairs for the first time. I think he's going to stay there, the way things are going. Yeah. I asked him last night when I talked to him, I said, you know, you've never done this. He said, no, man. I mean, I learned on the fly. He's like, I'm learning something new every week. And he said, so far, I've not run out of time as far as making the call. So far, the rhythm of the operation has gone pretty well. And I think it helps having a very cerebral guy, even though he's a rookie, in O'Connell. Vegas takes a timeout. So O'Connell, take a look at his story. From Omaha, Nebraska, originally no scholarship offers. He was a walk-on to Purdue. Started 33 games over six seasons there. Fourth-round pick. Actually grew up in the Chicago area, as he told us. Was a big Bears fan, making his seventh career start tonight. In and out of that starting lineup. But he is, I guess for the rest of the season, unless disaster strikes, he should be the guy all the way to the end. Yeah, and I think the biggest thing that he's doing tonight, he was a little tentative last week, just a little unsure. I think he was being careful tonight. He is more of a gunslinger mentality. But I think he's got the right mindset, you know, for a young quarterback to come in here and deal with a lot of adversity that they've dealt with and get through it. It says a lot about it. Third and ten. Deep in the pocket. And that's going to be caught, but short of that first down. Amir Abdullah. Going to make it fourth down and two. And they send in the punt group. The Chargers defense gets O'Connell and company off the field. They've been working. We've talked about in the open, what do the Raiders have to do? And I said, Max Crosby and company have to give their own offense a short field, and they've done that. And now you're finally seeing them have to work from deep in their own territory. And it's a three and out. The Chargers should have a decent field position here. A.J. Cole, his net average is 45.9. That's the best in the league coming into week 15. Darius Davis is there, calls for and makes the fair catch. ...finger for a quarterback's ability to grip a football. He had surgery on Tuesday with pins inserted to stabilize it. Brandon Staley told us there is no long-term concern, but complete recovery will take about six weeks, guys. And, of course, they need him, the franchise quarterback. He was at the end of his rookie contract, and they paid him. You know, for 20 minutes, he was the highest. You guys got the second half, boys. That's right. The whole second half. State Farm Halftime Show coming up. Actually, we're going to rotate all four. They're going to come up here like every third series. And we'll get out of that green room and eat that caviar that you guys dine out on every week. It will be second down. Second down. So it's second down. As it turns out, as they checked it again, second and one. make it third and one as Ron Torbert makes that correction boy the visuals say it all every time we go over to that trailer convention totally understandable up the middle that's a first down Abdullah to the 19 yard line and the Raiders are going to for the moment we're going to take a timeout but he's saying He's saying Bassey is the injured charger. Timeout on the field for an injured Los Angeles player. So it's an injury timeout. By rule, Los Angeles will be charged with its second timeout of the half. Of all things. I hate to see it. Anytime a defender lowers his head like that, that's always the big fear of the potential injury to the neck. Kaylee, down to you Well guys, Kenneth Murray has been back on the field during this series he was in the tent for several minutes with the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant as well as the athletic training staff. We were told the issue though was his left shoulder. He's been on the injury report with it for the last three weeks. They taped him up and he's back out there now. You look at him right now alongside Mack Murray leading the team in tackles. Meanwhile, the good news is Bassey is able to walk off the field under his own power. And with 36 seconds, Raiders looking for more. What song are you going to sing in the second half tonight for us? I think we're going to bring Elvis up here. From our morning meeting. First down from the 20-yard line. O'Connell to the end zone. Touchdown Raiders. Trey Tucker. his second of the night with a motion of Carter the defender running with him McConnell knew right away he had what he wanted with man-to-man coverage off to his right with his fastest receiver in Tucker and look at that separation again a deep over route offensive line does their job again giving him enough time Look at him get to the top of the stem of that route. Pull away from Davis, who's had a rough night. And here's Mack. One-on-one. Losing just not quite enough time there to get to the quarterback. Mumford does a nice job. He held him in check. Crossing for the point after. 31 seconds to the half. And here's a 30-second break with a score of 42-0. Maybe in the second half. We're in Vegas. Referee stops contest. You know, 42-0, largest halftime lead in Raiders team history. Checking to see the last time any team led by 42 in the first half. 2014, the Packers against the Bears, we were being told, was the last time. It was 42-0. We ain't done yet. tough way man I mean one thing that we've been talking a lot about these turnovers and we're excited to see the kid Easton Stick get his chance to make his first career start in for the injured Justin Herbert and really from the first series on this game has gotten away from the big guy in the league but that's a movable feast but he is done for the season Stick now from the 21 yard line Isaiah Spiller is the running back first time we have seen him but before we do there's a flag This was on the fraction defense Number 97 Five yard penalty His first down Janarius Robinson So Herbert of course came on As a rookie in 2020 Tyrod Taylor was the quarterback He was going to be the backup The injury timeline for him Fractured roots We did that game That was the opening Thursday night game Didn't miss any games Torn labrum in the offseason fractured finger non-throwing. He played through that until last week. And on first and five, that's Isaiah Spiller getting the carry. Second year guy out of Texas A&M. You build your entire franchise around him and it's going to be interesting to see some of the moves that this franchise makes on a lot of levels, but what they do to try to help him. I mean, you look at the players that are around him for the most part, you've got some age and you've got some decisions to make. One thing about it, Now, Herbert's a great player. But this offense has struggled this year. You know, they cannot run the ball. Eckler hurt his ankle early. Tom Telesco, the general manager, looking on. So you have the ankle. They haven't been able to run the ball last week. You know, they're 0 for 13 on third down. That pass is caught. Can he get the first down? Yes, he can with a thrust at the end that Stone's smart. Moving the six here. And the last thing I'll say, and I covered him a lot in college in Oregon, and he's 30-32 as a starting quarterback with the Chargers. So they haven't been able to capitalize in that first five-year window that they had with him, and they've got to make some decisions around him to get better up front and better scale-wise to think about trying to build for the future and what they can do with him, and that's the middle part of his career and beyond. Chargers, a lot of decisions to be made once the season ends. from the 33. The timeout is pulled here. A lot of the narrative has been, you know, hey, this was a team a lot of people thought had a chance to go to the Super Bowl this year. Lose their first two games, then they win the next two, then lose two, then win the next two. So they're 4-4 at the halfway mark of the season, but it doesn't come together for them. No, and I think you brought it up a little earlier, five losses. Just think about how this season, how different it could be. You have five losses by three points or less. I mean, Dean Spanos has to be wondering, how do we keep figuring out ways to lose games? We're playing well enough to win, right? But they always seem that in the fourth quarter, the ball bounces the wrong way, and they find themselves sitting here at five and eight. They could easily have seven or eight wins. They have lost maybe more gut-wrenching games than any team over the past two and a half decades. a whole litany of them. And not two and a half years, you said two and a half decades. Decades, exactly right. And I meant that. From the 33. Cutting to the outside. Isaiah Spiller. Speaking of charging, I guess to lose in heartbreaking fashion would be the definition of that in your Webster's. Including postseason, 31 games decided by 8 or fewer points. And the record in those games, 15 and 16. Since 2021, 6-12 in games decided by 3 points or less. And he could go on and on, but we won't. Second down and 7. Stick fires. And that's incomplete. Coverage is tight. Intended there for Alex Erickson. First time they've looked his way tonight. You've got Nate Hobbs covering on the play. It'll be third down and seven. I really feel like Nate Hobbs is emerging when he's healthy. It's one of the more versatile, one of the more talented slot corners in the NFL. He's physical. He's tough. You can blitz him. You can cover him. He mans up the way you just saw right there. Really the total package on the inside here for this Raiders defense and coverage. great job out of the slot third down and seven stick, look out under pressure, gun it away intended that time for Eckler you've got Malcolm Koontz who already has a sack tonight putting the pressure on fourth down by the way, keep in mind that Koontz is going up against Slater the left tackle, who's supposed to be one of the better left tackles in pass protection in the NFL All that attention on the roll. We'll see with Zamir White, who was nicknamed Seuss when he was in college at Georgia, is he is a downhill runner. One cut and get north and south. You saw that there on his first carry. And a great block up front there by Jacob Johnson, the lead fullback. McConnell. Deep drop. Deep throw. Going deep downfield. And that's incomplete. Coverage is there. Here Michael Davis covering on the play intended for Trey Tucker, the speedy rookie out of Cincinnati. It'll be third down and two. I think they felt they had some opportunities with the speed of Tucker to get one-on-one against Davis. They thought they'd go into it early, and he wins at the line of scrimmage. If the ball is thrown down in front of him, he's got a chance to put a big play up on the board, but the ball brings him back, and Davis catches a break. They went three by one, three receivers to the field, One back through the boundary created that one-on-one matchup. They missed a big opportunity there. On third down and two on the ground. And picking up the initial first down in the game. Keeping those legs moving up to the 46-yard line. You know, without Jacobs, that's a big loss. This time it's Amir Abdullah carrying. So he and White will carry the load tonight on the ground. And, of course, a duel and really known for his ability to catch the ball to the backfield tonight. He's going to be asked to have to carry the rock. Normally a third down back stays in there right now, first down. McConnell to the outside. And that is broken up. That's Asante Samuel breaking up. Contended for Devontae Adams. And for Adams, of course, he came here last year, wanted to reunite with Derek Carr. That lasted one year. And it's been a tough season for him right now. Yeah, it sure has. He's been frustrated at times for obvious reasons. Here is just really good coverage by Samuel. You like to see the Raiders. They threw second short. They take the shot downfield. Helps the offensive line in protection against Mack. And then a first and ten throw. Both times he had time to throw. Why not? Take some chances at this point in the season. Yep. Second down and ten. Fired over the middle. That's caught. Taking it to the 47-yard line. Adams making the grab after some stellar years, of course, with Aaron Rodgers at Green Bay now in the second season here. Yeah, they move him around. They do a good job of doing that. It really started with Josh McDaniels over the last couple years. They're just trying to create matchups and prevent teams from loading up on him and rolling coverage towards him. Of course, he's had a brilliant career. one thing about him is they give him so much freedom at the line of scrimmage and with his routes to try to find the leverage of the defense and work the other way. Third and two, draw. Nice run here. Give it to Abdul again. And another first down for them as Eric Kendricks makes the tackle for the Chargers. This offensive line, you know, we came in wondering, what's 70 of the right guard? Van Rotten does a nice job. He kind of shows that it's a draw here, sets up. He gets a nice kick-out block there on Joseph Day. See the tight end coming around Michael Mayer. Just like that, this offensive line opening up some room for these bats. Keep it on the ground. Moving to the outside. Nothing happening there as Brandon Bolden carries. Special teams got Bolden's been around. This is his 11th season in the league. Most of them with New England owns a couple of rings. Everybody talks about backup quarterbacks. One of the reoccurring themes I think we see in the NFL is reshuffling offensive linemen. That's what the Raiders are having to do tonight. They've got some injuries to their starting center, Andre James. Left tackle, their best lineman. Miller is out. So that's week one against the Broncos. You can see they've had to reshuffle the deck. And even the right tackle, Luminor, he was benched, so he wouldn't have been playing tonight either. That was Bolden's first carry of the year. They've already seen three running backs. You've got a flag thrown here. Hunter Renfro making that grab. Would have been about a seven-yard game, but Torbert will tell us the rest of the story. Brandon Staley in his third year with the Chargers. Penalty will be against Los Angeles. Offside. Defense number three. Five-yard penalty. The two-second down. So Brandon Staley took over in the 2021 season. Of course, any time you have a disappointing season like this where so much is expected, a coach is going to be on the hot seat. I don't know what's going to happen before the end of the year, but they'll assess at the end of the season. Brandon Bolden, who had not carried the ball one time all season, has now carried twice and into the end zone. And he goes 26 yards. The guy who's having a night tonight is Bo Hardegree, the offensive play caller. Everything seems to be working. The Chargers, not great effort on that play, especially with the tackling. They look defeated here already with 3.50 to go in the first half. Absolutely. Carlson for the point after. Well, for the second week in a row, we've done it before the first half, right? Yeah, you're right. 35 points. Amen. Jacoby Myers on the edge. You'll see him with a crack block at the top. Nice job on Mack. And then look at these linemen. Look at Theron Munford getting downfield. Jordan Merritt is getting downfield. There's a nice block on Mack. Get him to the edge. And now really poor job by the Chargers. Just not getting off of blocks. Davis right there. Just kind of an Ole arm tackle. and Bolden running pretty hard. Remember, this offense is without Josh Jacobs. You've seen a combination of Zamir White, Abdullah, and Bolden, all three of them getting their chances. Yeah. All three of them getting chances to put yards up on the board, points on the board. Go figure. You're right. Without Josh Jacobs, their ace back, a guy who led the league in rushing, you've got White, you've got Abdullah, and now you've got Bolden. O'Connell having a night. and for Khalil Mack and the Chargers what can I tell you? what can I tell you? you tell me now you summed it up I mean they just look defeated right now you know I'm not I'm not into piling on a guy but I know Brandon Staley's he was on a hot seat when his season started he's trending right now on Twitter because of the way this game is going. What isn't trending on Twitter? Yeah, exactly. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Pipkins matched up against Max Crosby. That is a tough assignment. You can see the pressures that Pipkins has allowed, but zero so far tonight. He's had some help from time to time with the tight ends. are back helping him out, but when he's been on an island so far, keeping Crosby off of this young quarterback, Easton Stick. Stick is 9 of 13, but for only 74 yards, Spiller is the running back. Everett. Incomplete. Covered by Amit. Robertson, now he got a flag. Back to the 20-yard line. Going to call that on Robertson of the Raiders. After the play was over, taunting. Defense, number 21. The penalty is 15 yards from the previous spot. An automatic first down. This is number 21's first sportsman-like conduct penalty for a potential disqualification. right up to the play just kind of steps over top of him has a few words for official right there to hear it and see it calls the the penalty and Antonio Pearson really Patrick Graham takes him right off the field put Bennett in for him yeah everyone probably said haven't we suffered enough and we're at 35 nothing you know let's let's play smart yeah leave us alone from the 40 Spiller for the gain of one with three and a half to go in the opening half. Pierce has to be happy with the way Patrick Graham and his defense is playing. The Chargers, six possessions, punt, fumble, fumble, punt, punt, and a punt. Pierce said when he took over the first thing he tried to do is rally the coaches and very difficult to get the offense in gear but tonight it is completely in gear Spiller yard of two shy of the first down third and a deuce I watched Isaiah Spiller quite a bit in college and he was at Texas A&M he is a talented back with good size I think he'll get more chances, whether tonight or the rest of their season, just to kind of feel him out. Brandon Staley told us he saw a look in his team's eyes. They had full confidence in Sticks. That's because they say he's been building it through these five years, running the scout team, going up against the Chargers' first-team defense. Austin Eckler told me he called him Dr. Sticks because he says Sticks gets surgical in practice with his ball placement, making superstar throws. Now we'll see if he can do it on the prime time stage tonight, Al. And Jaley, his moment has finally arrived. And there's Justin Herbert, who's been an Ironman since he was drafted back in 2020. But he'll miss the rest of the season. Broken finger there. The standings in the AFC West Chiefs are on top, but just barely now. Broncos, Red Hot. Chargers and Raiders are each 5-8. Raiders won the toss. They will defer. Chargers to receive. Darius Davis back. Daniel Carlson to put it in the air. And away we go from Vegas. Caught at the five-yard line by Davis out of TCU. And a decent run back to the 29-yard line for the rookies. So let's take a look at Easton Stick. Talked to him about a lot in the pregame show at North Dakota State for four years. He was there when Carson Wentz was there. In fact, when he showed up at school, he slept on a couch in Wentz's basement. and then Trey Lance showed up as Stick was leaving. So North Dakota State with a lot of success in the subdivision. Eckler is a running back. He gets it. Looks for room. Picks up about five. Divine Diablo in on the tackle. Will be second down. Let's call it six. Good thing tonight for the Chargers. It's been a difficult part of the entire year is running the football. And a lot of people have looked at Austin Eckler and what's wrong with him. He led the NFL in rushing last year. And a lot of it's been the offensive line. And you could really specifically look out on the edges at the tight ends. They've got to be able to do a better job tonight being able to run the football, take some of the pressure off the stick. Stick sets it up here, hits Eckler. And Eckler will take it up to the 38-yard line, setting up a third down and short. You're going to see that man in your frame a lot tonight, Max Crosby, number 98. And this is what I think all of us as football fans love about him. Watch him at the top and watch the effort. Recognition of his screen, balls out. And look at his eyes and then look at the closing speed. Never takes a playoff, whether it's the run or the pass, rushing the quarterback, he does it all. Third and three. Over the middle. Incomplete. Trying to get it there to Gerald Everett. You've got Marcus Epps covering on the play, and so the Chargers begin with a three and out. As you look at Antonio Pierce, who's the interim head coach, took over when Josh McDaniels got fired halfway through the season, won his first two games, but has lost his last three. Yeah, he talked about this week with us, you know, they're obviously embarrassed and disappointed, but he said, you know, these guys are pros. If you come out to our practice, our best players are our hardest workers, and it's really helped get through some of these bumpy moments that they've had throughout this season. J.K. Scott into punt DeAndre Carter back to receive standing inside his own 15 yard line fair catch called for and then there's contact there's a flag and another flag so running into him was Jossier Taylor so Taylor not giving him the opportunity to make the fair catch and that'll cost him Ronald Torbert is the referee tonight fair catch interference by the kicking team number 36 15 yard penalty from the spot of the foul Las Vegas' ball first and ten so the Raiders now and here is Aiden O'Connell this has to be a bit of a nightmare for him he started against the Chargers in LA week four what happened he got sacked seven times in the game six times by that man Khalil Mack this is a nightmare what are the odds you know his first The start is against Khalil Mack and it six sacks and here we are again And they minus Josh Jacobs their lead running back He is out tonight They start here with a run to the 40 line Zamir White, and he'll be the main guy, second-year guy, out of Georgia. Picked in the fourth round last year. Yeah, he gets downhill. He's very different style back than Josh Jacobs. Josh Jacobs obviously has some shakes, side-to-side jump cuts. Third and eight crowd booing because they've watched the replay. And see no laundry. Play clock is a two. And then third and eight. That pass is caught. That'll be a first down to the 30-yard line. Michael Mayer makes that grab. Goes right back to him. He got him earlier on a critical third down, and he comes right back to him on a great matchup against a veteran, Eric Kendricks. Just kind of that option route where you feel the coverage. works from the outside back to the inside. The timing is perfect. And again, let's not forget to give that offensive line, that reshuffled offensive line credit on those third downs, giving them enough time to evaluate that coverage and make that throw. Good protection. Going from the end zone. Olsen making the grab. Trey Tucker for the touchdown. How about that? Anytime you have a deep crosser, you know what you need? You need protection. And the offensive line delivers that. And I'll tell you, Tucker was known for his speed in college at the University of Cincinnati. He gets across. He's able to pull away. That's Derwin James. He's leaving him. But all of it because of that offensive line giving him enough time. Did he bobble that? He did once. Gets the foot down. Ooh. Close. Terry McCauley giving us a sign. It's good. Okay. Trey Tucker, the rookie. There's Khalil Mack getting a little extra attention there by Zamir White, helping out the right tackle. So Tucker gets his first career touchdown. There's a great look at it here. A little bobble. Yep. Looks like that right foot may have still been down, but he gets the left foot down for the touchdown. They're checking it. That's the reason for the delay on the extra point. Waiting for confirmation. All about the right foot still being down as he lost possession and then regained it. The touchdown is under further review. So they're still looking at it, okay? All right, back with the verdict after this. they took a long look at it we're going to bring Terry McCauley in after the extra point it's about as close as it gets getting control getting that right toe down left foot clearly in and the call on the field stands so two touchdown drives already for the Raiders. That's one you're glad you're not up to replay. That's as close as I've seen. Carlson for the extra point. And that makes it 14-0. We're going to go to Terry. Terry, take us through the touchdown here. Yeah, Al, this is when that clear and obvious standard to reverse and replay really comes in. When he gains final control, It has to be clear and obvious that that right toe is up, and it just isn't. It's right there. It may be, probably not, but it's not clear and obvious that it's not a touchdown, as ruled on the field. When is the last time we saw anything that was clear and obvious? Man, that is. Yeah. So, toe down, has control, left foot clearly in, touchdown. One thing I know is clear and obvious is this Chargers defense. You know, they allowed six points all year on just opening drives. That's the best in the NFL. And they're down 14 to nothing with Easton Stick making his first career start with Max Crosby on the other side of the ball. Well, that defense, and that's Brandon Staley's pedigree. He came from the Rams where he ran the defense under Sean McVay. The 29th in yards allowed, 29th in passing, and they looked like it. Meanwhile, last week, 12 possessions, no points. Tonight, two possessions, 14. So the Chargers already in a hole, and they will begin this next drive from the 25-yard line. You know, with Easton Stick at this point, you've got to take advantage of his athletic ability. Add him into the running game. You can run some zone read with him. Not a ton, but just enough to make the defense aware of it. You can get him out on the edge with boots and nakeds, things like that, where he really is comfortable. So it's not just sitting in the pocket, relying on the running game, and a play-action pass. You can definitely take advantage of this young man's legs. Here comes Crosby around on a stunt, but it's one-on-one on that left side because you trust Slater to be able to win. Malcolm Koontz is a good player, but you've got to win that matchup, and you lose there on third down. J.K. Scott his third punt of the night DeAndre Carter back takes it on the run of the 17 yard line decent run back 2-31 10-46 we had an Elvis impersonator this morning how many are there in Vegas what's the over under just a ballpark 6,412. 12. Okay. From the 30-yard line. On first down, O'Connell fires, and that's incomplete up at the 40-yard line. Attended there for Adams. Covered that time by Asante Samuel. It's a good one-on-one matchup. He's off in man coverage, has outside leverage. This guy just keeps getting better in his third year out of Florida State. You know, see the patience there by Devontae Adams on that route, and just a really good job by Samuel working around his body and using that right hand to knock that ball away. It's a heck of a matchup with Adams, the vet everybody knows about against Asante Samuel. Two big-time players, second down and ten. Through the middle. Picking up about five goes Zamir White, third down. To this point, 154 total yards for Vegas and 61 for the Chargers. And we knew that they were embarrassed. They told us they wanted to get back out on the field. But this is, they have not looked this good in a long time. The first two games against the Jets and the Giants, they got wins. Everybody's excited about AP. He's the guy. And then they lose a few. but man, they've not executed like this offensively in a long time. Third and five. Send an extra man, and the pass is knocked down. So the Chargers defense responding here. Looked at Antonio Pierce. He's the interim coach. It was kind of an interesting situation. He was the linebacker's coach. Not often does the linebacker's coach in his second year become the head coach. He's interim. Will he get the job at the end of the season? He'll be interviewed anyway. We'll see what happens. Yeah, time will tell. But I think the biggest thing is, and I was talking to Josh Jacobs about it on the field before the game, and there, of course, is Mark Davis, the owner. He'll have a big decision. I think a lot of owners are going to have big decisions. But Josh Jacobs just said, you know, we just rally around him. We love that he's been there and done it as a player, and we respect him as a coach. But he gets these players to really buy in. Pulls kick. That ball is out. And again, a turnover. DJ Turner comes away with it. The woman on the field is a fumble by the receiving team. Recovered by the kicking team. DJ Turner just ripped it away from the rookie, Darius Davis. I mean, it's almost like you saw it coming, and it's like, there's no way this is going to happen again. There's no way they're going to get a short field with another turnover. And sure enough, he ripped that ball and recovers it. And now they give O'Connell the ball inside a 15-yard line. Everything going right to the Raiders. Boy, everything going. Just a disaster for the Chargers. Complete nightmare for the Chargers here. 21 to nothing. From the fourth team, O'Connell at 50%, 8 of 16, 123 yards, two touchdowns. Over the left side, gain of a couple here for Zamir White. He'll be second down, second and eighth. Red zone's been an area that the Raiders most of this year struggled, but tonight they've been able to capitalize on their opportunities. Kenneth Murray is the injured player, so a timeout while they tend to him with 9.5 to go in the opening half in Las Vegas. First one right here, Koontz. sack fumble recovered Kelly fumbled recovered by Las Vegas and just moments ago on the punt return setting up a short field right now will be second and 17 while Kenneth Murray walked off under his own power three of their five drives in plus territory plus 42, plus 31 both of those touchdowns and now they're starting here in the plus 14 second and seven play action wide wide wide open touchdown. We're not having a great year with his spine not opening up a lot of holes third down and one not going to get it Eckler is there Jack Jones comes up to make the tacklers fourth down two and a half to go to the half. Here's another example of that offensive line on third and short he ran into a wall I mean just nowhere to go. Crossed the board. The offensive line loses. Max Crosby's in there again as a great run defender. How about the corner even getting involved? Jack Jones keeps him short of the first down. Fourth down. They can get to the two-minute warning before the play clock runs out. And they're happy to do that. Trust me. Two minutes to the half. 35-minute warning. If you're just tuning in, not a typo. All Raiders all night. It's fourth down and one now for the Chargers from their own 49-yard line. Erickson goes to the outside on the left. Keep it on the ground. And then with a flag down. That's Eckler. So he did not get there. Get the call here. Looks like the Chargers lined up off sides. And we saw that controversial call. And it looks like they did not make the line to gain. With off sides. Offense number seven. That penalty has declined. Result of a turnover on Dan. First down. So, I'm trying to think of a silver lining here. Of course, this isn't a big story all week with the Buffalo Kansas City situation. There it is clearly. Everett. Lining up offside. There goes the flag. If there's a silver lining, the flight home is only 45 minutes. You imagine doing coast to coast after this? That would be brutal. Yeah. Me on the other hand. Yes, you on the other hand. Flying from Virginia to Corvallis every other weekend. But you're off this week. Congrats. Looking for more. Adams. Green and nine of the 40-yard line. Tackled by Michael Davis. I keep bringing up his name as a play caller just because he's never done it. And nobody expected this performance. But Bo Hardegree continues to work this thing perfectly. That's a first down. Working his wing inside the 35. Samir White. I think they're trying to make up for the points that they didn't put up on the board last week. tonight. They get the ball to start the second half. They're in attack mode trying to get to 42. Yep. I don't think they're thinking about a field goal here. And at least showing I think some mercy at least at this point. I'm not calling a timeout either. Wee. From the 34. That's incomplete intended there for Hunter Renfro. And as fate would have it, who gets the ball to start the second half? The Raiders get the ball to start second. And think about this. Being in the mindset of the Chargers team. They're 5-8. They've had five games that have slipped through their fingers. They show up in a big divisional matchup on Thursday night on national TV. And you have three turnovers in your own territory. Put your defense in a tough spot. And you're down 35. You've got to go back out there and play some more defense. And lay a gigantic egg. A little bit of room to roam there for Abdullah. And Abdullah trying to get that first down. Kept on going. Then untangled here. I feel like this is always a mark of a team that is quick. And it's kind of shut things down. It first shows up in their tackling. and here's a tackle potentially by Derwin James and look at the effort here by the Raiders to just keep playing. He probably got another three or four yards to get that first down. Well, there's the gang. You guys all set? You guys all ready? You guys all ready? Start on the ground. To the 30-yard line. But Joshua Kelly, that ball is out as well. Raiders think they have it. Here come the officials. They do. Oh, boy. Jerry Tillery. One-time Charger comes up with it. And so a nightmare beginning for the Chargers. It looks like Epps, who came over from Philly this year, got his left hand on the ball. And then it got it loose. and then as he was going down, the ball just falls out of Kelly. You know, they felt like Isaiah Spiller might be moving closer to becoming that second back this game. And now with Kelly getting the opportunity, the ball is on the ground. Nothing going right for the Chargers here early. Please set the game's mark to 4 minutes 36 seconds, please. 4.36. The clock will start on the snap. Two turnovers in the first ten and a half minutes. White behind a fullback here drive starting from the 31 yard line and a whistle before the snap ball start offense number 16 5 yard penalty first down that's the best thing that's happened to the Chargers before tonight Jacoby Myers Full start Jim Plunkett and Fred Belitnikoff are here before the game It looks like the Plunkett Belitnikoff Raiders of yore Sure does I don't think anybody envisioned this Because it's a team that didn't score last week Right O'Connell Alton, 29-yard line, making the catch. And there is Tucker, who just scored the touchdown, making the grab here. I think what you're seeing from Aiden O'Connell, for people that aren't familiar with the rookie, is when he has time, there's a good look at Jim Plunkett there. When he has time to throw and his feet are set and things are clean, the ball comes out and it's accurate. You know, it's a guy who we talked about, Easton Stick. Here's a guy that didn't start until his senior year in high school, had an offer from Wheaton College, ended up walking on at Purdue. who is about eighth or ninth string, works his way up to become the starter, and ends up playing quite a bit for the Boilermakers, and now here he is as a rookie. Yeah, it's been six years in West Lafayette. He had one head coach, one offensive coordinator comes here, and they fire the head coach and the offensive coordinator halfway through the season. Yeah, he was with Jeff Brom, who was, as a head coach, he's now back at his alma mater at Louisville. But, yeah, 28 starts, and he talked a lot about all those reps that I received, All the opportunities to throw, because they threw the ball about 40 times a game, it really allowed him to transition into this NFL system where it's obviously moving fast. He's still learning about the NFL windows, but much better. So the shot of Jimmy Garoppolo on the sideline. Now the backup quarterback, third down and two. Blitz coming. Passes, reached for, and pulled into the touchdown by Jacoby Myers. Three plays, 31 yards, cash in on another turnover, and a three-touchdown lead for Vegas. Absolutely incredible catch by Myers, but the ball by Aiden O'Connell, we just talked about when he gets his feet set, the ball, you're going to give your receiver a chance. Michael Davis, he's been picked on a lot this year. Watch him peek back. Watch him look over his right shoulder right there. That's when he lost the play. Myers goes right by him. He peeked back, made that mistake, and it cost him. Comes over from New England. First year here. The seventh touchdown of the season. Who are these guys? Who are either guys right now? 21-0. So you had a sack fumble here. Vegas takes over, goes to the end zone. You've got a fumble here by Kelly. And then a third down and one into the end zone. Great catch by the former Patriot Jacoby Myers. And it's 21-zip. Yeah, that's why they play these games. You just obviously never know. Chargers have been pretty good in the turnover margin all year. Raiders have been disastrous at minus 10. And those turnovers have led to points. Run back from the one-yard line. Davis. Out to the 29. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Jacoby Myers told me when he saw the throws Aiden O'Connell was making in camp, he knew the rookie was a special dude. And he figured it was just a matter of time before he'd get the opportunity to show it. He said O'Connell has shown how mentally strong he is as he's been thrust into a tough situation with a new head coach and offensive coordinator. And Myers smiled as he told me, I'm proud of the way he's handled things. Yeah, I mean, it's a dream beginning for him tonight. It was a nightmare thus far for the Chargers to start from the 27-yard line. Heckler in the backfield. Give it to him. Reverse his direction. takes it to the 31. You know, when they draft O'Connell, you've got a flag down here in the offensive backfield. O'Connell picked in the fourth round out of Purdue. Holding. Offense number 77. Ten-yard penalty. The first half. It's on Zion Johnson. When they draft him, I mean, Garoppolo's going to be the guy. They'd already dealt Carr to New Orleans. Garoppolo, they get him from San Francisco. And then Brian Hoyer is going to be the backup, 15-year veteran. So he's going to start as the number three guy. There is Garoppolo, the backup tonight. Hoyer is the emergency quarterback. He goes from three to getting a start week four, which I think shocked him. Then he goes back to being three. Then eventually works his way up to being the backup. They fire Josh McDaniels, and he takes over. It shut out last week, and tonight he's on fire. Stick, throws, caught. Everett makes that grab. and the ball is out again, but this time fortunately for the Chargers they recover. Go figure here. Guyton is there to save it. I think he was down. I think Everett might have been down when they were ripping at the ball. Clearly the Raiders are attacking the football. They called it a fumble. Yeah, it was what Torbert just said. I think they'll take a peek at that and see that he's... Well, either way they keep possession of it. Okay. Spillane is there. He's had a great season. Second down and ten. Here's Everett, and he's got blocking out in front. Good stiff arm, and picks up a first down. That's a stiff arm born to frustration. Yeah, you could sense that. I mean, he ended up throwing Robertson, who is a corner and undersized, uses a helmet, uses the arm, all the momentum just overpowers him. By the way, that gave him the first down, that effort right there. Been that kind of year for the Chargers. A lot of frustration. Rolling to his left. Sick throws. Checks it off underneath. He is shortening and then banged out of bounds He was stone smart. Second-year guy out of Old Dominion. Gain of four. Kellen Moore, you know, the offensive coordinator who came over from Dallas. You know, these last couple plays, you saw the screen to Everett get the ball out, try to take advantage of the pass rush of Crosby and company. This time they roll him out, again, use his athletic ability, move that launch point. You don't want him sitting back in that pocket as a sitting duck. checking ahead for maybe a yard and a half and setting up a third down let's call it five is austin eckler see what they could do here on the third down remember his legs can be a factor here as far as mobility and his ability to improvise the chargers team down 21 it's so early in this game i mean with it with a quarterback who's making his first start you got to pick up this first down and you just got to kind of stick with what you thought might be the most effective way. You obviously don't want to get into these passing, just strictly a passing game down 21. End of the quarter approaching. Third and five. Look out. Sacked. And that's the way the first quarter will end on a sack by Jerry Tillery who already has a fumble recovery and now a sack. 21 to nothing Raiders after one and now a special look at Dune Part 2, only in theaters on March 1st. This is the end of the first quarter. With you on Thursday night. The Raiders have not done that much winning, baby, over the last two decades, but they look... Playing three days later. They can't be stopped. Third down and five, they picked up 17 on that last play, but they needed 22. and that stick is under pressure rolling and throwing and that pass is low and incomplete intended for Everett and it's fourth down This time this offensive line doubles him and they get pressure from the other side it gives you an idea of what he faces I'm still trying to see that image that Kaylee just showed of that knee and how swelling that he dealt with and then he ends up not missing a game. I mean, that tells you a lot about his approach and he wouldn't let him. Remember he said it came down to a game time decision. He said, guys, I'm playing. I don't care what you say. You're not keeping me out of this game. The postman, I think, stops him from his appointed rounds. Line drive kick fielded at the 24-yard line. DeAndre Carter takes it back to the 36-yard line with 7.21 to go in the opening half. 28 to nothing. Vegas. Five-yard line. Happy night for the home crowd. Blanked on Sunday. And 28 points tonight. And a three-yard pick up here. So we're talking about Antonio Pierce. He takes over. He wins his first game. He was a linebacker with the Giants. Had a great game in the 07 Super Bowl. with 11 tackles. Grew up in Compton, California when the Raiders were playing in L.A. He said he was born to be a Raider. And of course it'll be determined after the season whether he gets the opportunity to be a full-time head coach or not. Yeah, and I think the way it started, I think there was a ton of momentum. They lost a few games. Tonight's going to obviously help his case the way this game is heading. And he's going to have a few more games ahead of him. All you can do is go out and get your guys to compete. It's basically an audition for him and for a lot of these players as well. I just like the fact this guy doesn't have any head coaching experience, been around Marvin Lewis and been around a lot of other Tom Coughley he played for. So I think he brought them both around this team. He wanted to kind of use them as kind of just a wisdom that they provide. And he said, you know, even though I haven't been a head coach, as I look at Marvin Lewis, we had a chance to see him on the field before the game. And he said, you know, I haven't been a head coach, but I'm relying on these guys. I've got a good staff around me. I want to empower these players to say, this is your game. This is your team. Let's take it one week at a time. And I think this is an example. 3-0 last week. And look at them tonight. Marvin Lewis is ageless. That's caught. First down and a whole lot more. Devontae Adams. Davis runs him down. And Devontae Adams picks up 24 yards to the 32-yard line. And they brought pressure from his left. So it creates a one-on-one opportunity. And any time you get a one-on-one opportunity with Devontae Adams against anybody, especially against Davis, that's the matchup they're looking for. He is locked in again. The line gives him time. His feet are set. And he is an accurate passer, as he's demonstrated quite a bit tonight. 163 yards for O'Connell to this point. Three catches for Adams. They're going to throw it. Myers caught Adams he's done that before Jacoby Myers in fact before he ever scored a touchdown as a receiver he threw two touchdown passes with New England second and one and this just shows you, I mean you can tell pretty quickly like you said Al, it's going to be a pass once he's in motion, the depth that he gets but watch to the far right and watch the effort here, Adams is kind of waiting on the defender, he's either going to go by him or he's just waiting to just feel what's Asante Samuel doing, and he sinks, so he said, all right, I'll just take the first down, then I'll settle right there. Good throw by Myers. No, they didn't quite get the first down. Second and one. Running back is right. Four and a half to go. Said. They give it to Tucker. Loses one. We go to Kaylee. Guys, to add to the conversation you were having about Antonio Pierce, Jacoby Myers told me players were walking on eggshells under the previous coaching regime because of the expectations put on them, but a lot of that weight was lifted when Pierce became the head coach. Robert Spillane said 100% he wants Pierce to keep the head job. He said he's seen Pierce's personal growth in just these short six weeks, never blinking at challenges, and being transparent with the players. Yeah, we talked to him about what it's been like. He said it's been a tornado and a hurricane. Meanwhile, now, taking the snap will be Brandon Bolden. He'll keep it. He'll run, and he'll run all the way to the end zone. Stick and the Chargers with those three turnovers in their own territory. Raiders cash them in to 21 points. Might as well just shut it down here. Isaiah Spiller gains a couple. Some of the Chargers are just going to the locker room right now. The Raiders will do all the celebrating. and that's exactly where they are going. End of the first half. Raiders started hot. Bit hot. Let's go to Kaylee. Brandon, how do you describe the performance of your team in the first half? This wasn't good enough. That wasn't us out there. You know, did not come ready to play. You know, second half we've got to fight for pride. But it's a good group. We've got to regroup at halftime. Come out and try to play better second half. Thank you, Coach. Appreciate the fact that he even stopped by for that interview. A lot of guys wouldn't. Coming up after the break, it's the State Farm halftime. We trained all year round. We've played 17 guarantees. Got to finish season's charge. Oh, boy. Nightmare beginning for the Chargers. Aiden's approach. The name of the game is executed. Going for the end zone. Making the grip. Trey Tucker passes. Reached for it. Hold in for the touchdown by Jacoby Myers. Cash in on another turnover. Everything seems to be working. Who are these guys? Halftime, 42 to nothing is the score. We go to Kaylee. Well, Coach, Sunday you get shut out. Four days later, you got 42 points on the board after the first half. What ignited this offense? Well, just executing. That's what we talked about. We've been trying to do it all season, but we actually did it in the first half all three phases. You've got a lead like this. What did you tell your team about how they approached the second half? Press the gas, probably even harder. So it's 42 to nothing. The Raiders are going to get the ball to start the second half. 283 yards for Vegas in that first half and only 89. for L.A. Second half starts with a touchback. Now it's time for tonight's journey. It's presented by Hyundai. 42-point lead largest Raiders halftime lead all-time. It's the second largest in NFL history. No sacks tonight for the Chargers who had seven against O'Connell in that first game back in L.A. in week four. Four TD passes in the first half most by any player this season for Aiton O'Connell. And he starts here with a handoff and about a well, a two-yard game that turns into a five-yard game for Zamir White. I think the thing that stood out to a lot of people, including myself, would have been the play of that offensive line. I think coming into this game Josh Jacobs is down tonight. You've got Andre James, the starting center, and Colton Miller, the left tackle, out. So they've reshuffled things up front. And you've got Khalil Mack. And this Chargers defense, you said, had seven sacks in week four. You're worried, are they going to be able to run the ball? Is Aiden O'Connell coming off the game when they didn't score any points going to be back there? And Mack's coming after him again. And, man, it's been a completely different story. Second and six. Play action. Pass caught. Adams over the middle. first down up to the 47-yard line. You know, it's interesting because the headline story in the sports section of the Review-Journal in Vegas today was, who's going to be the quarterback in tonight's game? Some people thought maybe it would be Garoppolo. Yeah, and when you come off a game where you get shut out, and really let face it they lost three in a row This offense has just been reeling And it only natural to assume you know they going to go back to Garoppolo But you give Antonio Pierce and this offensive staff a lot of credit. You know, there are a lot of new faces out here that are being asked to do some things once they move on from Josh McDaniels. Give them credit. They put together a good plan and they've executed. Perfect so far. Bouncing off tacklers. And all the way to the 38-yard line goes Zemir White. It's a combination here. Again, this offensive line continue to do a good job. White, who, again, I'm familiar with because of his days at Georgia. Right guard pulls around. Nice block. We'll find out about his future and the future of a lot of other guys. Think about this in his defense. Austin Eckler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams. That's three of their stars. They've all been on the field at the same time. Only 9% of the time the offense have been on the field the last two years. And Allen is out tonight. Fake to White. Fired over the middle. Caught. Adams. Missed the walkthrough yesterday with an illness. But looking sharp on this first drive tonight as he takes it to the 15-yard line. They bring the linebackers, and that gave him room to work in the middle. pressure here and you're not going to win this right here. Nobody's going to stop him at the line of scrimmage. A little shake and look at the room because the linebacker blitz. Good job of holding up and great recognition by O'Connell to get that ball out of his hands quickly with that favorable matchup to his go-to guy in Adams. Gain at 23. He saw sick charges with three and out. Meanwhile, Vegas now running the ninth play of their opening drive. Four runs, four passes. Here's pass number five. Incomplete to the outside. Rob wants a flag. Don't get it. Jacoby Myers covered by Michael Davis. Second down and ten. You notice how Davis and Samuel both are sitting on these short routes? The scouting report on O'Connell is they don't get the ball downfield a lot. A lot of it is underneath and because of that these corners are jumping these routes. That was close. The official right there taking a close look. It looked like he got there maybe a bit early, but it's a no call in the field. But the corners are sitting on it. That's why they took that shot to Tucker on that second play of the game. Go three by one here on second and ten. And that's batted at the line of scrimmage. Mack got his hands on it. Trying to flip it to the outside. It'll be third down and ten. Mack leading the league in sacks. Crosby's only one and a half behind him, so a little individual duel tonight. No doubt about it. And you know how fired up he gets any time he has a chance to go up against his former team. It seems like every time he has a big game against this team, this offense. 10th year in the league. Having a great season, obviously, when you look at the numbers. Third down and 10. O'Connell fires over the middle. That's caught. Catches me. And it's a first down. Michael Mayer, the rookie out of Notre Dame. They picked him in the second round. Sets up a first down and goal for the Raiders. The motion by Jacoby Myers actually widens the backer and opens up this throw. Watch the motion come and watch the backer respond to it. It's Kenneth Murray right here. He'll end up floating out. Once he widens, there's the tight end. Nice job of taking that space. Good job by the offensive line on third and long, keeping Khalil Mack out. Mumford there on that left side getting a little help from the inside of the guard there. First and goal from the one-yard line and into the end zone for the touchdown goes Zamir White. So the Raiders, who were blanked on Sunday by week and couldn't score for about the last three quarters of the game before that, all of a sudden looked like a juggernaut. 12 plays, 68 yards, beautifully executed, and Pierce's team leads. See him greeting Aiden O'Connell, telling him nice job there. That's exactly why they talked about loving a short week after the winning shutout 3-0. They just wanted to get back out on the field and have a chance to put points up on the board, and they do it on his first possession. Flawless opening drive. Yeah, White in his second year out of Georgia. That's his first career touchdown. Daniel Cawson for the point after. A.J. Cole is the holder. And so the Raiders have the ball for almost five and a half minutes. Beautifully executed drive. And Las Vegas leads 7-0. What a drive. First time since the second quarter against Kansas City three weeks ago. He had a bye week in between there as well. Meanwhile, coming out from the end zone is Darius Davis. And he brings it to the 21-yard line. So, Easton's sick. Some notes about him. 49-3 was his record at North Dakota State. Michael Mayer. The Notre Dame rookie. Big night for him. 11 yards for a touchdown and a four. TD lead. What a job by Bo Hardigree, the offensive coordinator and play caller, who moved upstairs tonight to get a better view and a better field. Normally he's been downstairs. Maher's tight ends right here. Watch him sell this to the point that the big safety, Gilman, he ends up keeping his eyes. He had them in man coverage. His eyes go off of Maher. He looks into the backfield. Nobody's left out in the flat to defend Maher. An easy touchdown with a great play call. Well, for the second week in a row, we didn't think we would see that many points. But we already have 28 on the board. 9.15 to the half. Donald tonight getting the start after getting shut out last week. Adams making that grab. He got Mayer right there. Been on the mark. 9 of 17. 134. He's going for three touchdowns. Beautiful grab right there. Moving out of the pocket. He can't be any more wide open than that. So if you're the Chargers, I mean, this is kind of crazy. You draw inspiration from the fact that you go in and say, hey, we had a 27-0 lead in the playoff game last year and blew it against Jacksonville. So teams come from behind. Are you setting me up? Whatever. Inspiration is not a word that comes to mind. No, no, it's not. When I look at the 2023 Chargers, I've got to be honest with you. But I love the idea. I love that concept. It's sticking to that. Hey, whatever it takes, man. I'm telling you. At this point, from the three, Davis. Take it down to the 25-yard line. Get to see the other L.A. team next week on Thursday Night Football. with a self-high stadium where the Rams will be hosting the Saints and last year's quarterback for these Raiders in Derek Carr, now in his first year in New Orleans. TNF tonight starts at 7 o'clock Eastern time. Saints-Rams next Thursday. Talked a lot about Herbert, obviously, and Stick making his first career start. Now they're down 28. Keep in mind, this kid's trying to do this without his obvious go-to target, Keenan Allen, who's got that heel. So a lot of receivers, you're trying to find out who's going to be the guy that's going to step up. Josh Palmer is back but hasn't gotten a touch yet. A little trickery here, and that doesn't work either. Darius Davis taking the inside. A little flip there. Smiling Crosby. Crosby is quite a story, obviously. You know, had huge issues. Was able to rehab. He's played 97% of the snaps, which is almost unheard of for a defensive lineman. I just love watching him play, and I think anybody who loves football watches his enthusiasm. This guy does everything off the field, whether it's diet or it's recovery or it's the way he eats, the way he sleeps, every aspect. He's trying to gain an edge. Second and 12. Sick chase. It's out of bounds, and we've got a flag. Holding. Offense number 79. It's a 10-yard penalty. Repeat second down. Right tackle. Trey Pipkins. Mad Max. Since 2019, 51 sacks. He's played over 4,500 snaps. 300 more than any defensive lineman. This season, as I said, 97%. Now, why does he have two X's? If you follow this game, you follow the Raiders, you know. When he was born, he was 11 pounds, 9 ounces. So Mama said, you know what, we've got to add another extra large. It's perfect. But he said he watched Last Dance by Michael Jordan and watched it in like a day and a half, all 10 episodes. And that pass is caught up at the 29-yard line and then gang tackled there. Quentin Johnston makes his first catch. And we go to Kaylee. Well guys, to anyone who suggests to Max Crosby that he should shut his season down because of the knee injury he's been battling, he says, you don't know me. Through five years in this league, think about it guys, he's never missed a game. And no matter the Raiders record, he says he'll keep doing his thing. Here's a guy who was hospitalized on Thanksgiving with an infection in his knee. Look at that swelling. He said the pain was unbearable, and yet he was... So two minutes until the Raiders can accelerate and the Chargers, as we say, the only good news tonight is the flight home is about 45 minutes. Content to run out the clock. So this starts week 15. What about some of the other games on the schedule? Minnesota goes to Cincinnati in an early game. Saturday, Dallas and Buffalo Sunday is the late window there. We've got Baltimore against Jacksonville on Sunday night. And the Monday nighter is Philadelphia going to Seattle in a flex game. Some of the games upcoming on the schedule. Third down and two. And that's going to make it fourth down here. White gets stopped. And Pierce is saying. What? eight different players scoring a TD in this game. First time since 1950 when the Rams did it. Send in the punt group. Meanwhile, what a night for that man. 20-34, 248 yards and four touchdowns. And A.J. Cole will try to boom one and increase his lead in the net punting department. And that one will skip out of bounds somewhere around the 20-yard line. 31 seconds left. Not just a big night for Aiden O'Connell, but I just think if you look at where he is in his development in his career as just being a rookie and going through what he went through last week and some of the murmurs around town and some of the media wondering. You saw even in our tease where the media said, is this too much for you? Are you overwhelmed? And he just kind of had to sit there and take it, and it's part of growing up. And I think his response to that adversity says a lot about him and says a lot about what this offense is capable of doing with him at the helm. We gave props earlier to Bo Hardegry. A few more here for the guy who took over as the offensive coordinator. He's been downstairs. He's calling the game from upstairs now. He's probably on his way already to the locker room to celebrate with the guys, and that's going to wrap it up. So unbelievably, a team that gets shut out four days ago comes back and lays 63 on the Chargers. 63-21. So the Raiders go to 6-8. The Chargers go to 5-9. and they go limping home. Meanwhile, the Raiders get ready for their final three games of the season. It was still a chance, a chance mathematically to get into postseason play. I think you also have to add that the Chargers just not getting off of blocks. That started to become something we saw from about the early part of the second quarter on and clearly is continuing here into the second half. Play action. Moving to his left, buying time, pass incomplete. Intended for Jacoby Myers. Covered that time by Michael Davis. Second down and 10 for the Raiders. Keep in mind, he was sacked seven times. Six times alone by Khalil Mack. first time they matched up. This time, Mack ends up going inside instead of outside. That's what allowed him to kind of have that half roll away from where Mack was. Good job not only by the left tackle, Munford, but you saw Johnson, the fullback, also get involved. The whole key is keep 52 out. Make someone else rush the quarterback. It's worked. He's had all kinds of time. They've done a great job of that tonight. On every level. That pass is incomplete. And dropped by Austin Hooper. After those six sacks in the first matchup, we thought, okay, now you've got Mumford on him. Mumford, you know, he's not played a ton. He's moved around from right side to left side. Mumford's done a heck of a job. The second-year pro out of Ohio State hasn't had a lot of help. And I think the circumstances, having plus territory, throwing the ball in some early downs has really been smart. It's been a nice, again, a nice plan. Aiden O'Connell looks like he's very comfortable with the attack tonight. Third and ten. Keep it on the ground. To the 33-yard line goes Abdullah. And then you've got a flat coming in at the end of the play. A little join going on there with Davis and Abdullah. Ron Torbert ready to make the call. Abdullah came up grabbing his face mask. We couldn't see it. There it is right there. Justin Hollins. Yes, that's the discussion right now. You can see the motion by the officials. Torbert discussing it. Personal foul. Base pass. Defense, number 56. 10-15 yards from the end of the play. Automatic first pass. Good call. Good call, Nate. Correction, it's number 58. There you go. Number 58 on the face, man. Yeah, number 58, it's Justin Hollins. And that moves the ball to the 18-yard line. so without Jacobs tonight the Raiders have rushed for 100 yards little fake to the right side then he does go that way he goes to Myers and that'll set him a first down and goal at the 7 yard line you know for those of you keeping score at home And this is the worst rushing offense in the NFL. And they're over to 100 yards running the ball against his Chargers defense. And when you run the football, it allows O'Connell to have the play-action opportunities. And they continue to try to mix it up and do a good job on first and ten and trying to just get the ball out. It's the worst rushing situation, as you say. And without Jacobs. Without Jacobs. And a line that's reshuffled. First and goal. McConnell. Caught. And it'll take it to about the four-yard line as Jameer White makes that catch. Second down and goal. This is where you really, you know, I think Antonio Pierce, he's not letting up. 42-0. In his mind, it's 0-0. You know, don't forget that he's looking at this as an opportunity to showcase what he can do as a head coach, keep his team going, staying aggressive. Really tests you as a pro, doesn't it? I mean, really, you find out what you're made out of. And it's a tough set of circumstances for the Chargers just to continue to go out there like this. Second and goal. Myers is going to throw Touchdown Devontae Adams Hauls it in So Jacoby Myers No strength Despite the loss the other night Only two of 32 teams have been eliminated From contention, the Patriots And the Panthers These two teams still mathematically Alive 30 teams still mathematically Alive this late into the season Zamir White picks up about five. So the playoff picture as it looks right now in the American Conference. Baltimore, Miami, Kansas City, and Jacksonville division leaders. If the season stopped right now, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Indianapolis would be in as wild cards. Only the top seed gets a bye. What a race to see who's going to get that number one overall seed in the AFC. Don't forget Miami and Baltimore play each other. And Kansas City, look who they have left to go. There's a good chance they win their last four games. Good. Pressure. Meanwhile, in the other conference that time, the pressure was put on by Austin Johnson. NFC, you've got San Francisco and Dallas right now. And Detroit and Tampa Bay, despite a 6-7 mark. If you've got the Eagles, the Vikings, and the Packers would all go to the playoffs if the season ended right now. How about that, NFC South? Seems like every year it's like that, right? Again? Yeah, and we have the Saints next week in Los Angeles against the Rams. Right. Saints, I think, have the Giants come up this week. Rams have Washington at home. Third down and five here. Connell throws. It's caught. It's going to be a first down there. Michael Mayer scored a touchdown earlier. makes his fourth catch of the night. It's a guy that even as a freshman in college, he looked about like that. I mean, he showed up about 245, 250 pounds. He's just one of those guys that for three years in South Bend, just you thought, okay, where's he going to go in the NFL? And now that he's had a chance to get used to this system and get used to the speed, and I think the complexity of NFL defenses seems to be really trending in a great direction within this offensive structure. And with Jacoby Myers and Devontae Adams, he's a real weapon in the middle. O'Connell rolling. Keeps his eyes downfield. That's incomplete. I see a guy wearing number 87 for the Raiders. Kasper. Dave Kasper. Yeah. The ghost. Ghost to the post. The holy roller. When you think about it, these two teams through the years, speaking of that, Mark Teitelman and Pierre Moussa calling it right up for us. What took you guys so long? Stabler back to pass into the game against San Diego. Were you calling this game? No, no, no. I was in my basket for this game. Okay. A little fumble there, and then the ball is moved forward and winds up in the hands of Kasper for the touchdown and created a rules change. He kicked that ball about 10 yards. Leave it to the Raiders in those years. But that stopped the forward fumble. Yeah. I think it started with Stabler, really, at the beginning of that play. It did. I think you're viewing Malibu Kelly Hayes we're all over now. Absolutely. George Hill. The whole crew. Yeah, we've seen a few. But not that one. Third and eight. This is the white. What if I'm down? God, this kid for a rookie. Such great command. looking sharp throws caught short first down short of the first down as Amir Abdullah makes that grab in his fourth down I think they're going to punt it away which is fine at this point it's meaningless but I think you just go back to the development of this young guy and Antonio Pierce telling us he still needs to learn to pull the trigger and learn that you got to check it down don't take the sack, check it down don't worry about always having to make a play, and I think the only way you learn that is you go through that as a young quarterback, and I think this has been a great night for number four. Coles putt. Bouncing out of bounds. That won't help his gross average here, short putt. Well, Aiden O'Connell's had a big night, and part of that's because he's gone after number 43, Michael Davis on the other side, and it's not just Fin slants underneath, trying to make him, force him to make tackles. They've gotten behind him. Jacoby Myers with a heck of a catch. Nice throw. Goes up into the air and makes that one. And then a deep crossing route to the rookie Trey Tucker for a touchdown. You can see him frustrated at times. And you can see these numbers. Six receptions, 105 yards, and two touchdowns. That's just in the first half tonight. So that's our next. Dicker is good. Eight and a half to go in the fourth. 63-14. Who would have figured? Here's our high-performance 4K Skycam presented by BMW, and we're going to focus on Max Crosby, who always gives tremendous effort, no matter what he's facing, whether it's the run or putting the pressure on a quarterback. There's that spin move where he almost gets the stick, forces the ball out on a third down play, and just love to watch him play. Even when he doesn't make the play, he kind of helps force the play. That time, Koontz is the beneficiary. The quarterback's stepping up, and there's the big fella, Jenkins, getting up to, what was it, 17 miles an hour, I think. Was it 14 or 17? I think it got up to 17. Yeah, 17. 17 miles an hour. It's like Formula One when they got here. He's next. The yard in. Carter takes it back to the 24. What you got? It's been kind of an unusual night as far as these touchdowns. Here's a direct snap where they end up getting some great blocks, and Brandon Bolden takes it into the end zone. Here's a little orbit motion, and we see Myers. He had two throws tonight. That one was for a touchdown. This is the sack by Koontz and Vic Jenkins with the touchdown. And this play right here, unbelievable job, one-handed. Good job of recognizing that. Jack Jones takes it into the end zone, and even Mark Davis cannot believe some of these touchdowns he's seen. Going all the way up to 63 points. He's going, where was some of this last week? No doubt. Meanwhile, they're still throwing here. Devontae Adams up to the 29-yard line. So, in the NFL championship game, 1940, they won 73 to nothing. Washington, 72 against the Giants in 66. 6th off in 70 this year against Denver. And the Rams back in 1950 at 70 in a game. Second down and 3. Buying time. Throwing. Broken up. Went for the intended receiver. Derwin James is there. I mean, throwing his way very much tonight. Third down and 3. He's locked in that time to Devontae Adams on an option route. but the Chargers took him away. They got him bracketed. They had two different defenders on the outside and the inside. That's why he had to come off of that. He's not the most nimble. He's not a statue back there, but he's able to get away from some pressure that time he did. Just a nice play by Derwin James. This is the mark. Monday, Monday. What did he? What did he have? and they stop him short of the first down. That's Abdullah making it fourth down and one. And even though the crowd wants them to go for it, they will not. There's no way they're booing. Oh, no way. No way. They want to see 70. Yeah, we still have a little over seven minutes to go. Yeah. It's insult to injury, though. You know, you're throwing it at this point in the game. But with all these unusual touchdowns, you never know how they may score. But of course. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Well, you're going to race a 49-point deficit in six minutes. Caught at the 18. Darius Davis. Got one man to beat, and he'll beat him. And Darius Davis will take it to the end zone. But, but, but, there's a flag. Flag near midfield. Raiders already signaling it's against the Chargers. During the return, holding by the return team, number 84. The penalty is 10 yards from this spot of the foul. Los Angeles keeps the ball. First and 10. Timeout on the field. That's on Stone Smart. And negates what would have been an 83-yard touchdown return. 653 remaining. There it is. There's the penalty. Unbelievable. Like nothing you've ever seen. Ball at the 45-yard line. So why do you say, is it just how high it goes up? Yeah, but I mean, it's just the whole, the visuals. I mean, you know, U2 was playing, and they looked very, you know, tiny compared to the rest of it. It's hard to explain. It's been written about a lot. How are your seats? Very good. It was all the way around to knock that ball loose. How about the big fella, Jenkins, a nose guard, coming up with a touchdown? Came in the back door. So Jenkins, a 34-year-old defensive tackle, 11th year in the league. Came from Miami. Started every game. End of the third. 56. So John Jenkins is listed at 6'3", 327 pounds. And away he goes. And look at Antonio Pierce having some fun with the big fella. He's also 34 years old. Not only is he a big defensive tackle, I wonder how many times in his entire career he's picked up a fumble and had a chance to run it that far for a touchdown. He's still tickled down there. First season as a Raider last two years with the Dolphins. Check him out again here. This is great because we're going to show the speed of what he's doing. Crosby forces Stick to step up, and then Koontz comes around and ends up dislodging the ball. And here's the big man right here. He gets his hands on it. He sees a goal line in front of him. 14, up to 17 miles an hour. Just to put that in perspective. And I know that Tyreek Hill goes 22 or 23. He's going through the whole story of what he just did. Put your treadmill at 17 miles an hour to make you appreciate what Big John Jenkins just did. Not as fast as Tyreek, but faster than Benny Hill. Lost here. And a butler makes that tackle. Downstairs. Kaylee, what you got? Guys, I think everybody in a Raiders uniform or wearing black and silver on the sidelines has made their way over to Jenkins to love up on him and help him celebrate that moment. A couple of the guys were yelling, we've got to check the GPS. Check the GPS. You had to be going 20. They're going to be disappointed when I tell them he didn't hit 20 miles per hour. But, man, they thought he might have. 17? That's not terrible. And didn't need a pit stop. Meanwhile, Will Clapp, the center, is now down at an injury timeout in Vegas. Thursday night football is on. Next week, Alvin Kamara and the Saints take on Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Stream Thursday night football, on. Tonight on TNF Nightcap, presented by Allstate. Our team casts off the game with fun. Here we go. Fans and football's best. I feel like I haven't hit my ceiling yet. TNF Nightcap, presented by Allstate. After the game. Well, it's agonizing night for the Chargers. continues as Will Clapp needs to be assisted off the field on the cart. Remember, Corey Lindsley was their starting center early in the season. He went on IR. Clapp has come in to start 10. And now you've got Brendan Hymas, number 64. He comes in to take that spot. Yeah, that was a big loss for this offensive line. Lindsley, one of the top centers out after three games. the second down and 13 oh baby unbelievable jack jones they do it again i mean there are bad dreams and there are crazy bad dreams and for the chargers it's been that kind of a night. I tell you, Jack Jones, who plays a lot more man, he just read this. When Eckler went in motion, he must have seen this in a short week and he knew exactly what was coming. This is unbelievable. It's like he was in the huddle. Look at him jumping. He reacts quicker than anybody from the offense. It's like he knew that with that motion, this is the play they run to get it to 30 and he said, not on my watch. He just stepped right in front of it, one-hands it, and walks into the end zone. Most points the Raiders have ever scored. 63, and you have 14 and a half minutes left in the game. Most points the Chargers have ever given up. Remember, Jack Jones, he's a guy that has had to battle through. He's let go by the Pats. He's picked up here by Antonio Pierce, who coached him in high school at Long Beach Poly and at Arizona State. Believes in him. Gives him another chance and another opportunity. And at Easton Stick, nothing he could do there. As soon as he read that, saw the formation, saw that pre-snap motion, it was a good indicator for him to jump it. And man did he. If you think, all right, Herbert's out. You put Stick in. Who's the backup? The backup is the guy Max Duggan. Next-gen stats powered by AWS. On the outside, game of about five before Isaiah Spiller is bumped out of bounds. Second down. Each team coming in, five wins, eight losses mentioned in the very top. Chargers minds of many thought to be Super Bowl contenders The Raiders not quite thought that highly of They thought you know they brought Garoppolo in They had a Russian champion in Jacobs. But, yeah, not to be. Second down and five. Stick throws. It's caught just about at the line of the game. Never tries to get free. See where they spot it. Down just coming in. Looks to be Scotia short. See that body language from Everett. I mean, this is players who are obviously very frustrated with the season, with the night. A lot of different things. You can see it from Spiller when he went out of bounds. You see it from Everett there. Look at that. 1 for 25 on third and fourth down over the last two games. And finally, Finally. Move those sticks. Quickly. No flags. First down. Two minutes left in the third. And that's almost unbelievable. Dean Spanos, he's had some good times and some very frustrating times. And tonight, obviously, is of the latter category. From the 31. shoots it out here to Eckler breaks a tackle turns into a nice run and that should be a first down before he's tackled by Bilal Nichols Patrick Graham told me last night just talking to him about the matchup he had gotten the news that Keenan Allen was out of the game and he said you know before when I thought Keenan Allen was in the game he said everything's going to run with a young quarterback everything's going to run through him then they find out Keenan Allen's out And he said, listen, I know Eckler's not had a great year, but now we've got to lock in on 30. Not so much just in running game, but him catching the ball out of the backfield. We haven't seen a ton of it tonight, but that was the focus, is make someone besides 30 beat us. Yeah, they have locked in on him. Meanwhile, stick deep downfield. Too deep and incomplete. Down there was Quinton Johnson. He was the number one pick, the rookie out of TCU, but he has not had a good year to this point. And if you look at these receivers, there's just not a lot of production tonight. I don't know if you've got a young quarterback, and you get down early and it becomes obvious what the play calling is, but I think they were hoping Palmer, I know he had the big touchdown play where they busted in coverage, but just without Keenan Allen, there's no one really to turn to on the outside. With Mike Williams, who went down earlier in the year. Right, very early in the season, too. I mean, every team's had their share of injuries. Joshua Kelly is banged into the bench, takes a couple of the chain gang guys with him. It'll be third down and fourth. They've also, you know, Joey Bosa's another guy we have, again, that's on the defensive side. Then minus him. Talking about Williams. There's Justin Herbert, done for the season. They'll get no sympathy from any other team, though. I mean, everybody's banged. Yeah, everybody's banged. Totally at this point. Final minute of the period. Stick throws, and it's caught. And that'll be a first down. So Guyton is there. So after they were 1 for 25 in third and fourth, they pick a back-to-back third down conversions. And at that time, you saw Stick get back. And even it's third down, I think he had a good idea based on the coverage that he saw where he wanted to go with the ball and got it out quickly. No huddle here. Stick. Looking. Look out from behind. And the ball is out. It's going to be ruled. And it's alive and going to the end zone right now for what is ruled a touchdown is John Jenkins. He was popped by Malcolm Koontz, who's had a gigantic night. That's going to end the quarter. Obviously, all scoring plays reviewed. The bottom line is that Koontz continues to give the left tackle, Rashawn Slater, a tough time. Which, again, I think all the attention is on the other side with Max Crosby. But instead, it's the effort of Koontz. It's the effort of not giving up on that play. And he comes up with that big sack. You can see that Stick tries to avoid Crosby and doesn't even see Koontz, who comes by. Second and nine. Reversing directions up to the 41. Meanwhile, the remaining schedules, as we say right there, charges Buffalo at Denver, Kansas City. Meanwhile, the Raiders go to Kansas City, go to Indianapolis, and with Denver right here. And realistically, their only chance, it's a great night, but their only chance is they're probably going to have to sweep the three remaining games that they have and then need some help sitting there at 9 and 8. And it's tougher on the AFC too. The AFC, you know, very heavy in terms of the dominant teams this year. NFC's a different story. Stick. Gets out. Runs. Slides to a stop at the 48 yard line first down. Told you his legs would be a factor. Yeah, eventually. Only took 48 minutes. That's what I thought we would see tonight is his ability to improvise and scramble and try to get first downs. Very different from what you're used to seeing with Justin Herbert, but as we know, this game got away from him and his Chargers team in a hurry. Down 21-0 in the first quarter. Stick shoots it out. Juggle incomplete. Never had control of it. Starius Davis hit there by Tyler Hall. Man, this crowd smells blood. Yeah, they're not letting up just like the Raiders team is. Not at all. Like the Roman Coliseum right now. Second and ten. Caught. Running his way. Eckler. He picks up a first down. You know, we talked about the backup quarterbacks and O'Connell having a super night. You can go back to Monday night, Tommy DeVito. You go back to Will Levis at Tennessee. And they got O'Connell. Yeah, you could go to Jake Browning. I mean, it looked like Cincinnati was done after Joe Burrow went down. He has the big game in Jacksonville and follows it up with another win last week. So, you know, I think there's a premium on depth on offensive line play in the NFL and obviously that backup quarterback. No game. Spiller. Of course, the injury bug has hit just about everybody. Aaron Rodgers, fourth play of the season, the good-looking rookie Richardson. In Indianapolis, Cousins and Jones and Watson and Burrow and Pickett and Herbert. You know, what we really need is an offensive line, like a team's offensive line next to these quarterbacks, because I think it's a combination this year in the NFL of backup quarterback play and just seeing offensive line decimated, seems like every week. Stick throws, and that's Palmer right there. Joshua Palmer holds it in. Zone coverage, you've got to be able to layer that ball in over top of the linebackers, and what a great job of showing what he's capable of throwing this football. This is the area that he's improved the most in his five years. came into the NFL as a really good athlete and a playmaker. He'd be the first one to tell you how much he's worked on that aspect of his game. And that was one of the first chances we've had, a chance to see him get the ball thrown downfield. It had to be very accurate, and it was. Stick to the end zone, and that is hauled in for a touchdown by Alex Erickson. I tell you, you look at Sticks' numbers, pretty good, 20 of 28, 242 yards, two touchdowns. Yeah. That's a long way from being the story. A long way. A long way. You know, the motion, once again, helps him. Whenever it comes over, watch the safety. You get motion here. Watch the safety come down. And that changes the coverage. And he has to see that as the ball is being snapped. So it opens up that glance route, that skinny post there for a touchdown. So good job of seeing that after the motion. Tough thing to do for a guy without a lot of experience, but he saw it cleanly and made a great throw. Extra point by two. By the way, there are no bad seats in there because so much of the action is above you. So even if you're nosebleed, you're still in a good place. But you said it has to be a band, right? It can't be. I don't know. It's a good question. You came out raving the next week. It's amazing. Everybody's been there. They're going to get over there. There it is. All kinds of stuff going on. I said they have a big old eyeball that looks at you from time to time. It's crazy, man. It is crazy. But it's Vegas, too. Hey. It's out there on its own. Just a block and a half off the strip. Not bad. Good luck parking. You've got to walk over there. Third and five. Stick throws caught. First down. Making that grab is Joshua Palmer. Tackled by Tyler Hall. The combination of Max Crosby and a lot of the starters up front being out and also just softer coverage has given Stick a chance to be able to operate a little bit better and with more time. Softer coverage is hitting a lot of these slants and underneath routes. The game like this, you know, Max can spend some time on the bench, which he normally doesn't do. Probably bummed out about it. Probably. Coming in, he played 97% of the snaps. And tonight it's probably in the 70% range. There's Joshua Kelly taking it inside the 40. Again, I know everybody in the NFL works hard, but every time we talk to him, I'm always taken back on the commitment that he makes. He even talked about how it's tough for him to go on vacation because he has to have all his food prepped, and it's hard to do that when he goes on vacation. He is obsessive about it. He said he starts around January 30th, and he cranks from there. to the outside, getting around the edge and picking up the first down. Joshua Kelly. Kaylee, what you got now? Guys, I asked around, trying to find the best description of what it's like to face Max Crosby on the field. Austin Eckler, who was doing it tonight for the eighth time, he said, imagine a ferocious werewolf trying to stalk its prey, which is the quarterback, and it's just nonstop until the whistle blows. That's what Crosby is. He is just relentless. And Eckler did credit his former offensive coordinator, Joe Lombardi, for coining that term, werewolf. Kaylee, I'm glad you're still down there. I thought you may have bailed on this. First down here. Everett makes that catch. Now, how he referenced, going back to Rod Marinelli, who he had in his first few years while he was here, he said, you know, I don't really, I mean, I study who I'm going up against, but I'm too busy studying myself. And, you know, whether it's practice or games, always trying to look at where's the weakness, where's the strength, where can I get better. And he referenced Rod Marinelli as the guy that really helped teach him that early in his career. Yeah, he had to turn it around. He's very open about alcoholism and all the problems he had. And he's completely come out the other side. And a flag here. Might have been Nick Van Nett moving. Neutral zone infraction. Defense number 97 jumped into the neutral zone and caused the offensive player to move. It's a five-yard penalty. Still second down. Generous Robinson. they're really excited about Janaris Robinson and of course the rookie Tyree Wilson they think that you know Max Crosby gets a lot of attention from opposing offensive line and pass protection Coontz and other ones you have three other guys that I think they feel can win one on one little flip here and he gets slung down. Mary Bernie, rookie out of Florida. Six-pound pick. Is he going to make that tackle? Under four to go. Some room inside the ten. Spiller to the six-yard line. The one thing about Spiller, he will show you great patience. I think that's the area that he grew when he was at Texas A&M. He's more four yards. I think it's because I still, when I see that Raiders uniform, I still think of John Madden, and I think of some of the great teams with Marcus Allen. And when I looked and I saw that they've been in two playoff games since that Super Bowl, Jim Plunkett, I mean, you think of some of those great teams here. It's remarkable to think that that's all they've had in 20 years. Two playoff appearances. No question. In the 90s, weren't that good in this? Fred Militnikoff. Nice chat with the great wide receiver before the game tonight. Second down and sixth here. Let's go. Let's go. What did he? What do you have? Me and him a couple. You know, you think of so many people. You think Kenny Stabler, Darryl and Monica, the mad bomber. I think of Lester Hayes and the stick, of course. I mean, that was great. At that time and that era. How long do you think it took Lester Hayes to clean up after a game? That stuff wasn't easy to wash off. Third down and four. This is a franchise that started in the NFL in 1960. Moved to L.A. Went back to Oakland. And now here. Third and fourth. Step it up. But taken down, finally, in the backfield is Eric Kendricks, able to knock him down as he tried to escape in his fourth down. This is set up by Kenneth Murray. Watch what he does in just taking, almost like setting a pick on this pass protection, and it allows Kendricks to come off of his guy and eventually get that play. That's partners working together, bringing both the middle linebackers, occupy that left guard, frees up Kendricks, and you get the sack. Cole to punt in his third boot, line drive kick. Bouncing. Picked up inside the 10-yard line by Davis. Smothered. 8.13 remaining in the third in Las Vegas. 49.7. LV. You don't hit on like 19. No, hell no. I'm not doing that. Okay. No, but I know when to get up and go to bed. I'm good at that. As soon as we get back to the hotel. From the 10-yard line. Easton Sick throws it to the outside. Ezekieler knows the place to really go. run out by Diablo at that point, second down. Darius Davis had a rough night. The rookie out of TCU returning punts. He had to fumble deep in his own territory. This time, he puts him in a tough spot here. You know, that last punt by Cole, who leads the league in net, that won't hurt either, 65 yards and no return. at an 83-yarder, which resulted in a touch pass last week. Second down and six. So set up a third down and five. Eckler being a one. Let's lock in on 98 here. They'll move him around from time to time, but a lot of times, obviously, he's set up to the offense's right, coming off the edge, see if the Chargers on this third down are going to chip or double-team and leave Pipkins on an island. Halfway mark of the third. Sick throws, caught, but short of the first down. Palmer cannot get free. Tackle there by Jack Jones. Punt group comes in. So I said let's watch 98. Watch this move with Pipkins to the inside and then the spin move off of that. I mean, it's just unfair. Dips inside, gets the big tackle who's 320 pounds inside off balance, and then spins out of that. And he doesn't come up with a sack, but he forces the ball out quick, and it's just as useful. Man, that guy is great. Scott, his fifth punt of the night. High booming kick. Fair catch goal for made the 21-yard line by DeAndre Carter with six and a half to go in the third. And for a punt of 60 yards. Top season each conference. And those two teams will meet on Christmas Day. The Ravens have Miami and San Francisco. Eagles controlling the path to the NFC East division title. He's a throwing-the-ball high school quarterback. Did it very often and with great success in New England. Touchdown number seven for the Raiders. Yeah, he went on that orbit motion earlier when he threw it, but he came from the left. This time he comes from the right. And I love to watch the job that Devontae Adams did in selling that. Yeah, you're right. He looks so comfortable. and it's obvious with his background of being a quarterback. Doesn't panic, doesn't hurry. Baited the defender, made him come to him, felt threatened that he may just run it in. Pulled the defender to him, and Adams is all alone. A 42 throwing a wide receiver pass. I know, I know. Raiders should be, well, what can I tell you? The Chargers should be yelling mercy. He's enjoying every second of it. Chargers get the ball. This is Davis. To the 22-yard line, we go to Kaylee. Well, guys, we were surprised when we showed up to Raiders practice yesterday, and Devontae Adams was nowhere to be found. He told me it was because he couldn't get out of bed yesterday until about 6 p.m., and anybody who's got kids can relate to how this story unfolded. He said his two daughters, who were both under four, just got over having the flu, And it hit him next. He said it took IVs, vitamins, hydration, all of it to get him back on the field tonight. But you would never know how bad he said he was feeling yesterday by the way he's been playing tonight. Yeah, we may take some of that stuff, too. Seven catches for 94 yards. And a touchdown. Meanwhile, getting free is Joshua Palmer. And finally, something good happens to the Chargers. Josh Palmer, 79 yards. after missing five games and hanging his head is Robertson. Well, Robertson shaking his head. It just looked like he and the safety just not on the same page. Here's the corner right here, and you see five motioning out. I think that creates a little bit of confusion by motioning into the outside. You see Robertson look into the inside wondering where that safety support might be. And for the first time all night, the Chargers are able to make a big play offensively. So second touchdown pass at 6th career through one last week. Meanwhile, the extra point is just barely good off the foot of Cameron Dicker. 49-7. So the Raiders, of course, the mantra was from Al Davis all over those years. Just win, baby. What's it been like since the 2003 season? They went to the Super Bowl after the 0-2 season, lost to Tampa Bay. That drew BS at the end right there. They've changed coaches in midseason four times, including this year. 23 starting quarterbacks over the last two decades. tied for fourth most in the league. And there is the eternal flame of sorts. You know, Derek Carr's here nine years, and until we really looked at it, I had forgotten he got to really go back to Rich Cannon when it comes to quarterback play when the Raiders had some postseason success. That's 20 years ago. Yep, Cannon was the MVP of the regular season that year. and goes to the playoffs. They get to the Super Bowl, played in San Diego, and that's the year that John Gruden had been traded to Tampa Bay. Gruden had had the team for four years. Bill Callahan takes over. Callahan gets the team to the Super Bowl, but what happens? They face Tampa Bay, and John Gruden lifts the Lombardi Trophy. Meanwhile, in terms of the drafts as well, it's been tough. Since 16, you've got Joseph and Conley both out of the league. Miller's a starter, but he's hurt tonight, not playing. You've got Ruggs and Arnett out of the NFL. Wilson's a rookie, so not a lot of success when it comes to first-round picks over the last several seasons. No, it's been a disaster. I mean, you look at these guys, a lot of these guys, it's not that they're on different teams. Look at how many of them are out of the league. And you're talking about not mid-round or late-round picks. These are first-round picks since 16. You're just going back six or seven years ago. Nice to Mike. Monday, Monday. Monday, Monday. Easy. Six is the mic. Six is the mic. Monday, Monday. From the 25. What do you have? Go, go, go. On the ground. Picking up about four of an outside zone runner. So I think he's always shown that ability to kind of just press it, wait, wait, and then find that crease and hit it. This is a second charge timeout. Las Vegas. This is a 30-second timeout. Well, take advantage of the time out to show you the playoff picture one more time. Ravens right now would have the one seed and the bye. Dolphins, KC, Jacksonville would host the game in the wild card round. Texans, Broncos, Bengals, Bills right there in the hut. And if she again 49ers already in the playoffs But Dallas you get Detroit Can't obey right now would would host the playoff game Did you see that shot of Antonio Pierce before we hit that playoff picture? I mean that guy is still down there which which of course you're gonna see but You know you don't always see head coaches showing that kind of passion right now. He's he's challenging these backups To not just give up and let them score. He wants to see him fight and compete He really went after Tyree Wilson there. Second down, three. Can't get outside. Spiller has stopped there. Third down. One of the things you think about Antonio Pearson as a player, what he was able to do, right? And he played with fire. And I think that's the aspect that he brings now as a coach that this team, especially this defense, feeds off of. Guy's been there before and knows what it takes, and I like how he challenges them. Third and three. Stick. Goes the other way. Touchdown. Making that grab is Quentin Johnston. So Stick will hit Johnston for a touchdown last week. Goes back to the rookie again. the rookie out of TCU, and it's their third touchdown of the night. And how about Stick there working? He's got motion here with Palmer, and then watch him work from his right. He wants to go to 82, comes off of it, looks for the check down, and comes all the way back to the left. Works one, two, and eventually three on the backside for that touchdown. Good job. Correction, he has his TD against Detroit earlier this season, but had that long game, their only long game last week. In the loss at home to Denver. The extra point is good. Two and a half remaining in the fourth. So we come out to the ballpark. The first half. And at least their offense has been able to put some points up here. They were shut down. What was the score? 42-0 at halftime. They put 21 up in the second half. That's a great number right there. Last four games. the shutout last week against the Vikings 46 in four games tonight, 63. Touchback next Thursday. I told you we're going to be at SoFi Stadium in L.A. Derek Carl leading the Saints into town. Aaron Donald, of course, spearheading the Rams defense on Thursday night. Football. So funny. Last time I did a game in this stadium was the last game of the 2021 season. I remember. The Raiders and the Chargers were meeting. The winner was going to go to the playoffs. Unless they wound up in a tie, in which case both teams. I mean, what are the odds of that? Well, right. I mean, at the beginning of the game, you're thinking, the Steelers, they need a tie. It's never going to happen. I swear to you, Chris Collinsworth and I are driving out here, and he says, what about if there's a tie? I said, get out of here. No chance. And, in fact, in that game, Rich Passaccio was the coach, and he was ready to play for the tie, get them both into the playoffs, but Brandon Staley had other ideas, got a little aggressive, and then Carson kicked the field goal, and that sent Pittsburgh to the playoffs and sent the Chargers home. I cannot believe it. I mean, that's one of those, you've called so many big games, Super Bowls, That's a memorable game because it's just such an unlikely outcome. And Herbert was phenomenal in that game with fourth down completions and the last drive to no avail. Another unbelievably agonizing defeat. Almost self-inflicted over that night for the Chargers. Who's a rookie out of TCU who was second to Caleb Williams and the Heisman balloting last year, but he was just all the way from the practice squad. He hasn't played a lick. Right now, there's just not a lot of options for this Chargers team, but at this point, obviously, other than just getting reps, it obviously doesn't matter. Meanwhile, they just put up the graphic that we told you about, 63 points the most ever in Raiders history, and that's the reason for the crowd. With 14.31 to go, all they need is 10 more for the NFL record. Only 10? Only one. No problem. It's just a big celebration. It's a team that was shut out last week against the Vikings. Tonight, a very different story for Devontae Adams, Jack Jones, the entire Raiders team. Chargers five turnovers and burned after every one of them. Spill him. Remember Mills Lane, the great referee? Sure do. Yep. He would come in and go, referee stops contest. He'd wave it off right now. Second and nine. It's like Diablo is down. Yeah, divine Diablo. That's taking advantage of takeaway, right? I mean, that's pretty good percentages. Five takeaways, five touchdowns. So you go from one game where you just want to hide from everybody to the complete opposite end of the spectrum if you're a Raiders. And now it's the Chargers. Well, as we said, going to commercial off the C-Sip, it's the NFL where anything happens. That's why they have all these big buildings out here. It's impossible to predict what's going to happen. Ain't that the truth? First starts, timeout of the half Next week Home day Yeah, hey, how about that? The Saints and the Rams Rams trying to hang in that playoff hunt They're there right now Trying to get to 500 They beat Washington this week And we'll kick it off next week At 8.15, free game at 7 o'clock Eastern from SoFi Allegiant Stadium. Well, Vegas has become a sports mecca. Remember, this is the home of, who would have ever believed it, of the Stanley Cup champions. Yeah, and they've been good pretty much from the jump. Yeah. Yeah, beneficiaries of a very lucrative expansion draft. speaking of that, Miss Spiller so you got the Golden Knights this town loves their champions, Stanley Cup champions, got the Raiders relocated here in 20 when they built the stadium Ron Free was held here recently in November, the Aces owned by Davis two championships, Super Bowl will be played here in February, the A's are moving here, new stadium opened in 2028 and a guarantee on the NBA outlook day in Seattle will be the next expansion franchises in all likelihood. Stick throws it's caught and taking a pop right there is stone smart. Isn't it amazing how far professional sports have come with this city? Sure. I mean it was taboo, you wouldn't want to talk about it, you wouldn't want to even think about sports gambling and professional sports and everything that it's associated with, you never would have ever envisioned there'd be franchises here and now everybody's coming in. Totally embraced. Moving ahead is Joshua Culling. So the Chargers will go home. Their next game is a Saturday game against Buffalo. Then they go to Denver and they end up at home against Kansas City and easy and a knife of that guy 241 yards four touchdowns I think he has secured the starting
