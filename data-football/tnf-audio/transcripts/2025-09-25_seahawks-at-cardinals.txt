 Never really located him. Made it pretty easy for him to get the pressure and come up with a sack. Waning seconds of the quarter. Seattle, their first of the half. This will be a 30-second timeout. You know, you look at Mike McDonald. What's so interesting, his pedigree, of course, is defense. He calls the defense. On the other side, Jonathan Gannon, his pedigree is defense. But he said, when I get the jump, I'm not calling him the defense. I got a guy who can call the defense better than I can. Yeah, I mean, first of all, who admits that when they talk about an interview process? But he said he had other interviews, other opportunities, but he made it crystal clear to everybody that even though you're hiring me because the job I did in Philly as a defensive coordinator, I'm not going to, I want to be a head coach. I don't want to be a head coach that's calling the defense, and I want to bring my guys with me. And Arizona said, you're hired, you're our guy. But it is interesting, two defensive-minded head coaches doing it very differently. And so Nick Rallis calls the Arizona defense. Di Mercado in the game is the third down backstage in the block. Murray around the corner. Can only tightrope the sideline for a couple of yards. Chased by DeMarcus Lawrence. And that takes us. Lawrence went into the tent. He was slow in getting up. He's out of the tent quickly. Here's the punt now from Blake Gilligan. It's a good one. Fielded at the 18-yard line. This is Horton who ran one back 95 yards last week. And he's stuffed at the 25-yard line. So the Seahawks have such a great, or through the years, have had a great home field advantage. But on the road now, they're 10-1 in their last 11 road games. Seven straight road wins. Only loss in the McDonald era was early in the season to Detroit last year. Four and eight at home. Who would have ever thought that? I mean, they ended up playing 10 games last year, seven of them on the road. Seven and one. It's great that they have that road focus. They know what it takes to be able to go away from the friendly confines. But, man, we all think about the 12s. We think of Seattle being one of the toughest places to play. Hopefully they'll get that back this year. Charbonnet is the running back on first half from the 26-yard line. Charbonnet to the outside, turns the corner, short game. In fact, Seattle was so great at home during the Carroll era, A lot of times the league would not give Seattle primetime games because they were blowing everybody out. And they used to get Pete Carroll crazy. And you probably wanted to go in there. Of course. Second and seven. Over the left side. This time goes Charbonnet. Late flag. And a flag comes in. Way back from center field. That was about a 22-yard throw by that fish. Defense number 70. It's a five-yard penalty added to the end of the run. Automatic first down. I mean, he let that fly. It's a good job of recognizing this from way back. I mean, he saw this. And it's the right call. Climbing up to that second level. Look at that left arm locked up around the neck. We're talking a lot tonight about Seattle's defensive line. But with Dalvin Tomlinson, Calais Campbell, Darius Robinson, there, Dante Stills. Cardinals have a really good group as well. That was an emphasis coming into this year. And the call was on P.J. Mustapher. Nowhere to go. On first down. Zach Charbonnet is stopped there. Charbonnet out of UCLA. 6'1", 214. Walker, of course, is the key guy. Yeah, Rollis, who they're the defense coordinator. There's Wilson, who is really the coach of this defense in the middle, went down after that play. They've had so many injuries already. Their top three corners are out on this defense. Now Mack Wilson is down. And Will Johnson, who is their second-round pick out of Michigan, he's inactive as well. Yeah, you go back to Sean Murphy, Bunning, Garrett, Williams, now Will Johnson, top three corners. They're doing a pretty good job of surviving without them. Playing a lot of zone, but right there at the end of the play. Yeah, he's able to get up and walk off. Hopefully he'll be back. Into the 10, he will go. There's a loss of two on the play, second down and 12. Now this is a defense that's had to move a lot of people around. They have such great versatility with Buda Baker, Jalen Thompson, who normally is a nickel, but because of the injuries to the corners that we mentioned, he's having to now move around and play different spots. And now you lose Mack Wilson. Up in motion. Darnold looked that way, and Darnold gets swallowed up at the 30-yard line. That's on Barron Browning and Calais Campbell both coming in. Calais Campbell, 39 years old, 18th year in the league. We all love to see him out there, 18 years, 39 years of age. He's on the inside, but watch the getoff by Barrett Browning. In a sprinter's stance, they try to chip with a tight end. But I'll tell you, he's played all-fall linebacker at Ohio State, also at Denver. He's settled in as an edge player in this defense, and his pass rush is just as dominant as Sweat on the other side. 3rd and 19. Walker. On his feet. Picks up about 3, so Seattle's going to punt. The third punt. By the way, the punt is becoming like an artifact. These days, because the field goals are so long, and teams are going for it at midfield, that the punter can take them most of the night off. You know, it's the time of year where baseball, you get into the playoffs. Sometimes you go to a baseball game and it's sloppy and it's an ugly game. Then you go to a 2-1 game and it's a good pitcher battle back and forth. This is going to be a battle of two good defenses going against each other tonight. No question. They gave Campbell a full sack on that play. He's got three already this year. Sky-high kick. Fielded at the 13-yard line by Dorch. and Dorch angles his way up to the 27-yard line with 11.57 remaining in the frugal. Look at Campbell, 39 years old. That's a guy that's still as competitive as anybody and really like a coach. Talking to those young defensive linemen. They respond to him, too. Yeah, without doubt. Had the sack on the last series. Meanwhile, there's a little bit of room on the left side and an eight-yard pickup here for Shea Fenton to set up second down and two. You know, any time you lose one of your alphas, it's devastating. James Conner went down with that in-season-ending injury a week ago, and they lost their leader and captain. His toughness, I'll tell you, Trey Benson, has a lot of ability. Go no huddle here, go quick, and nobody's around the neighborhood except Marvin Harrison, who's a good 10 yards away. We've seen this a lot, you know, with Marvin Harrison and Kyler Murray just not on the same page. He's up at the far right. He's running one route. Coverage adjusts late. He's running a fade to that coverage. And Kyler Murray is expecting him to stay on the route and cut out. So we're seeing a lot of that. They're still kind of working through some things. And hopefully that gets on track soon in his second year. This fan base is getting more and more frustrated. Third and two to the outside. Falling down and making that grab to get the first down is Michael Wilson. That is called his ball at Stanford. Yeah, the question with this offense when you lose James Conner is who other than Kyler Murray is going to make plays? Obviously, the tight end McBride, who Kaylee just talked about. But who else? Is it going to be Benson? Is it going to be Harrison? They need others to step up. He's caught underneath. Can he get free for a few more yards? Witherspoon is able to finally corral Benson every picture of three yards. The obvious answer, when you ask who's going to be the guy to step up, should be, and you would think would be Marvin Harrison. Second year, 6'3", 220. And I feel like when I watch him, because I've watched him a lot throughout his career in college and now in the pros, he looks like a guy that's thinking a little bit too much. He doesn't have his confidence. He's a little tip. Murray has a second pass battered. Going up tempo. That's Leonard Williams doing it. Again, third down and seven. So the 6'5", Williams takes care of the 5'10", Murray. Just a final thought on Marvin Harrison. I just feel like he doesn't play with the urgency that we saw with him. I think he's still kind of trying to find that confidence that he played with in college. Just a little timid, maybe unsure. Just needs to turn it loose. Be more aggressive. Nation's top wide receiver in 2023 at Ohio State. Third and seven. Murray. Off balance throws. And there's the main man, McBride. Picks up and up for the first down. And that's what you do. That's what they told us that they had to do tonight without James Conner. We're going to run the ball. We're going to flash it and let him know we have it. Truly, it's a game about getting the ball in space. And then guys making people miss. Here, their best player, McBride, makes Josh Joe miss. And they get the first down. They're on third down. Good conversion. First and ten every play. No huddle up tempo here. At the Seattle 49. To the right side. And there he is again. McBride field. Elijah Arroyo. The rookie out of Miami. A gain of 32. Now he got downfield against Josh Sweat. Who normally is going to rush the quarterback obviously here on his own pressure. He's out in the flat. Now he's just kind of dropping. And Sam Darnold, he had room to run. But he sees this matchup. There's no way Sweat's going to find the football, so put it up to Arroyo and let him adjust back, and it's a huge gain and a great job of recognizing that opportunity there by Sam Darnold. Arroyo, 6'5", second-round pick out of Miami. Look at that time for Darnold. Everybody's covered, though. Sam will take off. Darnold slides to a stop at the 32-yard line. This is what he does, right? I mean, you get so caught up in what he did in the previous play because he's usually going to make you pay with the arm. He sees man-to-man coverage right away off this play action. Look, it opens up. Why not take off? There's nobody there. The linebackers are out. The safeties are out. Everybody's got their back turned to him, and he's got the athletic ability to get those yards. Good job of recognizing again. Doesn't even need to take a breather. Just comes right to the line. Take hold over the right side. Around the corner goes Charbonnet. of a Lucas block. I know it's your favorite. The old pin and pull. Good shot by the receivers. Nealing the edge and then they are able to gain that perimeter run. Something, if you're a Seattle fan, this is what you want to see. Whether it's outside zone or Al's favorite, the pin and pull. Get that run game going. Whatever that is. Two minute warning. New stadium in a couple years. Maybe in 27. Get a Vanderbilt. game. Yeah. The 19-yard line. As Charbonnet picks up one second down. Got a good drive. Obviously by Sam Darnold in command. They got a big opportunity here. 145 and counting. They get a chance like we've seen we talk about every week. A two for one. A chance to score here at the end of the half. They're not going to be in a hurry here to give Murray much time to work with. And then they get the ball to start the second half minute and a half second to date keep keep drop and zone flag is thrown and incomplete let's see about the flag intended for Arroyo Baker says defense number three the ball goes to the one yard line first down we brag a lot about Buda Baker and he is in a tough spot where he turns really never finds the football and just makes the interference right there he tries to strip at the hands but let's go back to the throw by Sam Darnold off of the play action he's been showing this a lot ability, great technique Look at him falling back and throwing to his left. And look at that location of that ball right on the money. But Baker out of position there. They asked him to do so much in his defense. And that time the tight end got behind him. And he had to play catch up. From the one. Stumbles a little bit. And Sherman A is stopped at the one-yard line. Second down and goal. 1-10. I think he got stepped on by Anthony Bradford, the right tackle. Or the right guard, rather. Foot right there. Looks like he got him. Good job. Again, the athletic ability by Darnold to be able to keep his footing. There's the step right there. Look at that. That's a big man at 335. And a heck of a job. Even though they didn't score, just finishing that play. Stepped on by any defensive lineman. Not good. You had a problem. Meanwhile the timeout was taken by Arizona. They're just trying to conserve some time on the other side to get the ball back. Smart. Second down and goal. Charbonnet and Brady Russell. Russell's the fullback. Charbonnet's the tailback. They get to him. Donald rolling, throwing. That's incomplete. Try to get that one to Elijah Arroyo. Our friend Peter Schrager was touting him. Yeah, he was. He's a guy who might score a touchdown. I think he could have walked. Yeah, he's done a good job of getting outside on these boots and throwing. But he's got the left guard, Zabel, the rookie. Look out front. But if he breaks contain there, he walks to the corner with 76 out in front of him. Good job. I know he wants to keep his vision downfield. He wants to make the throw. But, boy, with that guard out in front. First down. He tells the crowd, hey, come on, let's get into it here. Yeah. Surprise Seattle of all we just said. The one guy that can hurt you is right here. I'm surprised they're giving him a free release. And that's going to be tough to be able to stop any tight end, let alone Trey McBride. Free release off the line where he's flexed out. And then a nice job of throwing it over top of the corner out in that flat zone coverage. Perfectly thrown football and a good route. 17-yard gain, Arizona's longest play of the night. First down in the 32-yard line. They go empty here. Play fake. Down the sideline, it's out of bounds. Xavier Weaver, first time they have gone his way. Second and ten. Good job there with Josh Jobe. who's become a much more consistent corner in this defense in his second year, really understanding this guy was on the practice squad a year ago. There were some injuries. He worked his way up to become that third corner last year. And now here he is starting as a corner on one of the top defenses in the NFL. And I think he's playing with a lot more confidence in that time in phase. Good tight coverage on that fade down the sideline. Second down, ninth play of the drive. underneath Mention trying to get away but his knee is down. They whistled him down right there Tyrese Knight made the tackle I think the thing that's kind of cool about Seattle is they don't panic as a defense. You know they gave up a few passes. You're getting into their territory but they have such confidence in that zone. Primarily a zone defense which allows the linebackers, safeties, corners to keep their eyes on the quarterback They're going to give up some yards, but they feel the closer you get into their territory and the deeper you get, that eventually they're going to be able to squeeze you and make you have to kick a field goal. Third and 11. Murray throws. Juggled and intercepted. Harrison couldn't hold on. And now you've got Ernest Jones with the pick and the run back into Arizona territory. What a job by Kyler Murray. What a throw here. He puts it right on Marvin Harrison. And yet another drop for Marvin Harrison. We talk about a guy that might be thinking too much there on a crossing route. He knows he's going into traffic. Doesn't really focus to be able to hold on for that first down catch. Instead, the ball comes out. Seahawks with a pick. This becomes a theme here in Phoenix. There he gives up on a crossing route. Ball's picked off. They were lucky to get that one back. Here at third and short, miscommunication. Quarterback wants the out. He adjusts to a fade. And in here, just looking ahead, trying to see where the contact might be. Not able to finish on the play. And again, I just think you see a guy who's uberly talented just not playing with confidence. It's like his mind is paralyzing his ability to be the receiver he can be. To the turnover, Seattle has the ball at the 29-yard line. Off the play fake. Plenty of time in the pocket. Deep down field. And it's juggling. Not caught. Torrey Horton is there. The rookie, Max Milton, is able to break it up at the end. Second and ten. They went with a three-tight end look. Under center. You're thinking they're going to run the football. They just want to be able to stretch this defense. and they got exactly what they wanted with the speedster. This guy can really fly. We've seen that already this year as a rookie. That time, that ball's on him. It's a good job of recovering by 16, Max Melton. But Sam Darnold gave the rookie a chance. Defensive back, didn't even see the football. Would have been a great catch, but the ball was on him. Would have loved to have seen him bring that one down. Second and 10. He's already had two receiving touchdowns this season and a 95-yard punt return. Darnold over the middle after he looked right. Goes to his third option, and Jake Bobo makes his first catch of the night of the 32-yard line. Again, you saw what I saw. He's looking left, but watch his feet in rhythm. This is what we saw from Sam Darnold last year working with KO left. It's not there, and instead of being late, he's decisive because he has answers. There's the eyes to the left. Nope. Come back. Look at his feet in rhythm. Puts it on him, and a nice first down. He had both Barner and Smith and Jigwood to his left. No sir. Over the middle. Finds the open guy. Halfway through the second quarter. First down from the 32-yard line. Slipping a tackle. Picking up four. Kenneth Walker to the 28-yard line. Injury update. Kaylee. Yeah, guys. Both teams' defenses. Some things to address. Mack Wilson, the inside linebacker for the Cardinals. He's back out on the field after going into the x-ray room to get his ankle checked out. But for the Seahawks, not as good of news. Defensive lineman DeMarcus Lawrence, he is doubtful to return because of a thigh injury. You see him on the bench there. That's too bad. 11 years at Dallas. Comes over here. First year as a Seahawk. Probably done for the night from the 28-yard line to the outside. And a nice first-down saving tackle that time on Walker is made by Keitel Clark. Once again, I think Cooper got late flags there. They came in well after the whistle. Two flags on the near side. He saw that Clark made the tackle and grabbed onto the foot of Kenneth Walker. And then he threw the ball at Clark. And that's when the flags came in. After the play was over, taunting. Offense number nine. That's a 15-yard penalty. It'll be third down. and that is number nine's first, this unsportsmanlike action towards this qualification. I think it's important to recognize that, and I'm not saying it's okay, but Walker responded to Clark after the tackle. The play is dead. He grabs onto his foot. You'll see it here at tackle. Grab onto the leg. Give him a little shove. Walker's got to walk away. Steady points, and then he ends up eventually tossing the ball at him, and right in front of the ref. Well the league the league put an emphasis on talking a couple of years ago. They've turned it into a felony 15 yards Good way of saying third down at 18 Donald sets up a screen, but a great tackle is made there at the 44 yard like to lay a stumble For the big play for the 39 year old would be his last year You kind of took him down that path, and he said, I'm taking today. I'm getting ready for this week. I don't think about the big picture, playing the 40. We're all just enjoying watching this guy play. He's not a kicker or a quarterback trying to get to 40. He's a defensive lineman in the trenches playing like this. Yeah, he dangled a couple of carrots in front of him. I said, do you realize how close you are to being all-time for the front seven? Meanwhile, here's Dixon. Another punt, and Dixon's punt bounces at the one and skids into the end zone. Five minutes. Now I've got to go into my memory bank. You know everything. Well, I used to. You do. A little flare here. George. By the way, before anybody writes in, this is the state capitol of Phoenix. Yeah, I think I know that. Yeah. It's still a stomping ground. It is, Arizona State. Yeah. But, you know, we're here in Glendale, just outside. Anyway, that was... What a play. That was unbelievable. You know, he was off to the races. Everybody watched that for a long time. Gave you an idea about the wiring of DK Metcalf. Former Seahawks. And now with Pittsburgh, here's McBride. I'm now told by our vast research department, Seattle held him without a touchdown. How about that? He's rewarded for that effort. It's the way it should be. He's been a great player through the years, as has Metcalf obviously too. Budapaker, ninth year here. There's Mack Wilson getting loosened up, trying to stay after that injury. Third down and two. Given by going to snow huddle, gives Murray a chance to look to defense, getting the right play on third and short. Going to give it to Michael. Carter's going to carry for the first time tonight, and that's not going to get to the 30-yard line. So Carter, fifth year in the league, been around. Has he played this year? Yeah, before you question a call, like I said, that's Kyler Murray looking at the defense, thinking he's got a numbers advantage. But the problem is, even though there's only four down linemen and two linebackers in that box area, they don't commit safeties down. These guys get off blocks. That time it was Jaron Reed who was able to get off that block and keep Carter short of the first down. Great play. Go against third punt. Really good one to the 9 yard line Here's Fortin Cannot spring free And half the white shirts on the field Make the tackle there 63 yard putt, 2 yard return We will return In a half minute Third overall pick By the Jets back in 18 Carolina, San Francisco in Minnesota. Now Seattle dancing in the pocket. Buying time. Keeps his eyes downfield. Deep throw is going to be hole in. Downfield all the way down. Got a couple yards shy of the first down. Barnard. He makes the catch here. It'll be third down and two for the Seahawks. Let's just not take for granted Sam Darnold and where this guy was in his career in New York and Carolina. And for all intents and purposes, I think a lot of folks in the league looked at him as basically damaged goods. He's done. He talked this week with Al and I and Kaylee about how his stop in San Francisco, we're like, of course, Kyle Shanahan. Brock Purdy, the younger quarterback he points to as a guy that's really helped him turn his career around. First time I ever heard something like that where a younger guy, after Charbonnet picks up the first half, we're always talking to the quarterbacks. Hey, who's the most influential? So it's always some older coach. Josh McCown. Well, yeah, you go back to Mike Shanahan. You go back to a lot of people. And then all of a sudden, Brock Purdy. Brock Purdy. And he said he helped me learn what it takes in paying attention to detail in preparation. And then he goes to KO in Minnesota. And we know what happened. We talked earlier about that. And I think he's just resurrected. He's confident. And now Klank Kubiak has him playing in rhythm when he's play-action passes. Yep, right there, play-action. In trouble. Down he goes at the 40-yard line. But the one thing about Darnold, it's such a parallel here with him and with Baker Mayfield. That's Darius Robinson who celebrates at the moment. Darnold now is a timeout here. He's an injured Cardinal down on one knee here. So that's the reason for the break. He will go back to that QB class in 2018. Baker Mayfield is number one. Needing to make a play, and he's making these plays. So, yeah, he and Darnold, great examples of going through some really tough times and coming out on the other end better for it. Kenneth Walker. Yeah, we were going through all the storylines we wanted to talk about tonight in our meetings. I'm going all road spots at this point. Darnold, meanwhile, third and 11 here. Early third quarter. She hawks up 14-3. Play clock at three. In the pocket. Protected well. Caught. And scrambling to the 25-yard line goes Charbonnet. So that'll be fourth and one maybe. So do they need the offense out? Every coach these days is looking the offense out there. Actually, the kicker's coming out. I guess they're looking at the big picture. Could be. Maybe the 10-point swing. You know, the touchdown before the half. He just said to Kaylee how important this series is. And instead of risking it, get to three points and look at a ten-point swing. It's a 44-yard attempt for one of the best in the league, Jason Myers. And Myers' kick is good. With 8.56 left in the third. Seahawks trying to get to 3-1 on top 17-3 in Glendale. Tom Mammoth. Arizona State plays C.C. Udaman. You're all over. There you go. Here comes Dorch. To the 35-yard line. Well, if you're a Cardinals fan, you've got to be asking yourself, when is Kyler Murray and Marvin Harrison going to get on the same page? We saw a big drop last week. One of the things I'm recognizing is just not only are they not in sync, I think Marvin Harrison's not playing with the confidence that you'd expect him to play with here. It cost him an interception. In fact, two interceptions tonight. He's thrown six when targeting Harrison over the last two years. That's the fourth most when a quarterback targets one receiver. So he's trying to get him the ball, and I think it's got to be frustrating for the quarterback and especially frustrating for a young receiver that has so much potential. He comes in here, they expect him to be the next Larry Fitzgerald. Yeah, fourth pick overall, you better be. Right. Benson, congratulations to Larry. He was named the guy that will be considered. Of course, he's out five years. So if you want to bet that he'll get in on the first ballot, you bet $1,000 to win $1. I mean, he's there. He's in. That's a lot. Breeze as well, obviously. Second down and eight. Deep downfield. He grabbed onto his arm. Right. Michael Wilson trying to find it as he was going downfield. Gets interfered with and a big break here coming up for the Cardinals. I just love to see that they're trying to stretch the defense. There have not been a lot of shots downfield. Haven't had any success. When you can get pressure with four, the defense understands exactly what to do, and they can keep eyes on a quarterback, and you can't run the ball. Timeout. Seattle, that's their second of the half. Thirty seconds. Well, it's a great, there's no question, Seattle's got a really top-grade defense. Arizona, I mean, that loss of Connor is not only big on the field, it is very big in that locker room. Yeah, the leadership. I mean you taking the alpha off of the offense the guy that everybody they fed their offense through him and they in a fed off of his energy So Kyler Murray Murray becomes you know it his offense but now it really becomes him And when you got a young superstar receiver that is struggling you're trying to, who's the guy other than the tight end McBride that can help you consistently make plays? It makes it pretty tough. All right, barring a defensive foul, this will end the half here. Two-man rush. Now you got Michael Wilson. To what avail. Well. And off we go third quarter. Darik Young brings that out to the 33. Moments ago, Kaylee on the field with Mike McDonald. Mike, what has your defense done best to keep the Cardinals offense out of rhythm? We're playing really hard. We're communicating really well. We're on one accord. Some things we want to attack. Let's go. Let's get the ball now when it hits our hands. Yeah, we just saw your offense in the end zone. Now you get the ball back. How do you keep that momentum going? Well, this is a great opportunity to double them up at the end of the half. It's a big series for us. It's a great opportunity to step on the gas. All right, thank you. See if they can step on the gas here. Yeah, Kenneth Walker is the running back. He's back in. Yeah, the Charbonnet did all of the heavy lifting on the last touchdown drive. The fake lookout from behind. Ball is out. But the Hawks are right there to recover it. So Darnold got clipped from behind by Josh Sweat. Well, we talked about him maybe on a loaf where if he finished the play, maybe he keeps Charbonneau out of the end zone. But here, this is what he's known for, obviously, the ability to use those hands, get around the left tackle, cross, and then finish on the play using that right club to knock the ball away. Cards had their chance. That's exactly what they needed, but a good heads-up play by Barner to get that ball back. One of the tight ends. Eric Saubert with the recovery. Second down and 11 now. Smith and Jigba will take the toss so he hasn't caught a pass but a nice run here close to a first down we were talking at halftime let's take a look at our next gen stats we'll take a look at them in a second but one of the things we talked about is we're surprised they're up 14-3 and their top receiver JSN has not had an opportunity to get his hands on the ball until that that's one way instead of worrying about trying to force the ball into him The coverage, it's very complex and complicated. And they're really determined to take him away in this game. Just pitch it to him and let him make some positive yards. Third down one. Charbonnet is the back. Rolling against the grain. Throws across his body, and that's a first down. A.J. Barner scored a touchdown in the first half. Makes that catch. And now we'll take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. We just talked about how they have really done a good job of squeezing him with leverage. He is the focal point on this Arizona defense, inside and outside, whether they're bracketing, anything they can do to take him away. In this case, you take him away. Watch the defense. Watch 27 White kind of slide outside with him. Then the tight end releases. So the defense is so cognizant of what he's doing, it opens up other options. First down. Chase. and finally Walker out of bounds right into the Arizona bench second and 18-2 I bet nobody on this team feels more upset than Walker something you just don't see him losing his cool I've watched him at Michigan State before that he was at Wake Forest I never in my life had watched him play where he got, you know, a guy grabbed his foot in the first half if you missed it they were in full field goal range it was going to be about a third and two and he lost his cool and threw the ball at him it cost him 15 yards now it's a third and 18 They're out of field goal range, and I'm sure he wants to make up for that at some point tonight. Walker, 9 carries for 48 yards to this point. Second down and 8 to the outside. Walker, two rushing touchdowns last week against the Saints. Exploits that hole, picks up 8 yards to the 27-yard line. Second and short, we go to Kaylee. Guys, Sam Darnold's been through a lot in his eight NFL seasons, and Cooper Cub believes that Darnold's ability to weather the journey is an elite trade. Bad plays and experiences can scar a quarterback, keep them from wanting to pull the trigger. But Cub said Darnold does a great job separating the good from the bad and moving on to the next play. Yep, that time he avoids the sack and then throws it at the feet of Walker. In a complete third and two. Right on cue, Kaylee. You said how he's kind of moving on to the next play. That's been the knock on him early in his career. when he was starting with New York and Carolina is how many interceptions he was throwing. In fact, from 18, 19, 20, 21, four years, he had 52 interceptions. And it's because of what Kaylee mentioned, trying to make a play. That got eliminated from his game last year. He was much more decisive, and it's continued so far in Seattle in the early part of this year. Third and two. Looks to his left, fires to his left, caught. And to the 16-yard line goes Cooper Cup. Some Seahawks fans here tonight serenading him. Of course, he had that spectacular 21 season. Super Bowl MVP with the Rams. Watch Mack Wilson here. He's showing it. Now he knows the ball's coming out, and he's dropping towards Cooper Cup for that very reason. On third down, there's a very good chance they're going to look up to the slot, try to find number 10, who settles into that window better than anybody. and he almost got a hand on it, but good job by Sam Darnold getting that one out in a hurry to give Kup a chance. From the 16, good protection, and open for it. Touchdown, A.J. Barner, the tight end. There's a guy that I think Seattle is very excited about, A.J. Barner here against Davis Gaither. That's a great look at it right here. 88 against 27. A little hesitation. And then down and up. And look at the placement of that football. All 13 snaps so far with two tight ends. Get the matchup down in this red area that they want. The big, talented tight end who keeps getting better and better. Matched up against a linebacker. Easy throw and a nice catch for the touchdown. Barner's second TD of the season. So the cards get a field goal. Seattle responds with a touchdown. A minute and a half to go in the opening quarter. Seattle 7, Arizona 3. I had one of my few trips to Europe. You go over there all the time. A few times. Greg Dortch from the goal line. And he gets spilled up at the 26-yard line. The tackle was made there by Ricky Young. Mike McDonald, it's a very sophisticated defense. That's how he got the job. He's the defensive coordinator for John Harbaugh for years in Baltimore. And they spent one season with Jim over at Michigan. Yeah, I think this being the second year in this defense, much more continuity. They don't blitz a lot. Second lowest blitz rate in the NFL, yet fourth highest pressure rate, meaning they don't have to bring people because they're so gifted up front on this defensive line. This time they line up six across. Paul given in the backfield to gain a four yards. Benson over the left side, second down and six. I loved what he said to us this week about this defense. They're tough and they're connected. And if you watch them play in these first three weeks, when you watch the film and you watch their pursuit angles and you watch them fly to the ball, that's secondary, that's a great description. Tough and connected. And you'll see how this game plays out tonight. But if you haven't watched a lot of Seattle this year, Richard Sherman's got to be really proud of this secondary and the style in which they play. They disguise, but they play with bad intentions. Without doubt, but look out! and almost on cue there, through the middle. That's how Lieutenant Moussa is the guy who comes in through the middle, almost on block third and 16. And Moussa is another guy. I mean, you think of Derek Hall, Demarcus Lawrence, Leonard Williams, Mike Morris. You know, you have Morfe. And instead, it's Moussa who is getting healthier. Last week, they said, you know, it's the first time we've really seen him flash since he's been coming back from injury. and this time just a really good job there of the right guard, Isaiah Adams. Yeah, the crowd saw it on the big board. Different ball game now at third and nine. Third and nine balls back at the 15-yard line. Better contain Murray to threat the scramble here on third down. Out of the pocket, throws, caught. gets away, does Dortch, but not far enough to pick up the first. So he stopped just inside the 10-yard line. What a great thing when you can get that kind of pressure. Your ends are getting upfield to prevent him from escaping. You get a good push. That's just with four. You're allowed to play zone there. Keep your eyes on the threat of him taking off, and then you just got to tackle and wrap up when they throw the ball underneath. Connor frustrated. He couldn't move it any farther than that as Chad Ryland comes in for a chip shot. Of 27 yards. Six out of eight this season. That's the 57-yarder in the one-point loss to San Francisco. One game. Offense. Five-yard penalty. Four fouls. Well, not the worst thing in the world. Unless he gets the upright. Right. Then I'll make it a 32-yard field goal attempt. Blake Gilligan to hold it. Meanwhile, Aaron Brewer will snap it. But first, these words from Alex Kemp. It's just a matter of resetting the play clock. Yeah. So the play clock gets reset at 25. Now you've got a 32-yard attempt. And after all that, the kick is right down the middle. Four and a half remaining in the quarter. It's 3-0 Arizona, and we return in 30 seconds. Pick off George Helani is back to receive. Each team, of course, coming in 2-1. The division is very tough. It's the NFC West. 49ers are unbeaten. The Rams, the Cardinals, and the Seahawks are all 2-1. from the four-yard line. Holani to bring it back. Coverage is good. He's tackled in the 23-yard line. Nine times, Rams blew him out, and that ended Minnesota's dream last year. From the 23-yard line, off the fake. Pass is caught on the outside, and picking up a first down there is Elijah Arroyo. So Darnold comes in. He's pretty much going to be a placeholder, J.J. McCarthy. He's going to be the guy McCarthy gets hurt in training camp. And then he almost messed things up because he had such a great year. You wonder, Minnesota at one point, we'll put McCarthy on the bench next year. Yeah, really, really tough decision. I think they felt that McCarthy was clearly their guy. But you're right. Sam Darnold resurrected his career last year in Minnesota. Here's Walker. Nice move. Bumps into his own man, and he's close to a first down. Bumped into Charles Cross. the left tackle along the way. Yeah, great athlete at left tackle and cross, able to get out there. Receivers with this group, you're going to see they get pretty physical, very willing to block, help him get to the edge there. But that's their game. They want to go with two tight ends. They want to run the football, which, again, has been a bit of a problem here these first three weeks. But they will stick with it with the hopes of getting ahead of the chains and then putting Sam Darnold in those play-action opportunities where he is so effective. Second and one. Keep it on the ground. Walker around the right side with a burst to the 35-yard line. Kenneth Walker behind an Abraham Lucas block for the outside to gain a 21. Yep, now you're on it. Right tackle, Abraham Lucas. That's the key block. He's able to get a good push, just kind of seal that edge. Push Collins. Watch him use his leverage. Push him. Push him with that right arm just enough to allow Kenneth Walker to make that read. He's inside. Now he sees the grass, bounces it, and uses that speed. It instincts and vision to get those yards. That's the Seattle running game they want. You almost never see the three guys going to be in there to block. Somebody's going to have an escort. You recognize it before the defense recognizes that. Watch Cooper Cupps block 10 right in the middle. You've got three, as you mentioned, out in the front. Big tight end. The Royal able to get out there as well. That's really an extension. That's their run game. This is a team that prides themselves on the outside zone, want to run the ball to set up play action. But you know what? They haven't been able to run the ball that well the first three weeks. That's a great way there, a little wrinkle, to get kind of their run game going, even though it was a throw. Running back is Charbonnet, who was hurt last week, didn't play on Sunday. This is Jackson Smith on Jiggle, who's their number one receiver. You know, you watch that four-by-one thing, you never see that. You wonder if coaches will begin to start using something like that more. Yeah, little quad look. You're right, that's not something, especially Seattle hadn't shown that at all. This is a team that you're going to see a lot of two tight ends. They're going to pound you. They're going to try to run the football. Very different. Could not be any more different than who they were last year when Ryan Grubb was their offensive coordinator. It was more spread, more shotgun. As you can see, they're under center quite a bit with Sam Darnold and this new system. And he's comfortable under center. Second and eight. Hand up goes here. Breaking a tackle longer, but he backs up And runs into a pass to the white search behind the line of scrimmage, setting up a third down and long. This is a defense. I was Baron Browning coming off the edge. This is a fun defense to watch because it is so confusing. Dick Wallace is one of the best DCs, I think, in the league. Young coordinator and eventual head coach. I think everybody, all of his colleagues around the league feel that way, and he's got this defense playing with so much confidence, It's very complex for the offense to figure out, but it's simple and allows the defense to play fast. Go five wide here. Five minutes into the game. It's a third down and ten for the Seahawks. Pressure coming. Gets it away. Caught at the 48-yard line. Trying to get that first down. Is Corey Horton who leads his way up. Close. We'll see where they spot it. He was stopped about three yards shy. Yet, Muda Baker blitzing on the play. And let's see where we're going to put the ball down. They're going to put it down. Still putting it down. Just outside the 47, so they're about a half a yard shy. I think Buda Baker recircling there. I think you can see the ball wobble. He got a fingertip on it. What a job by Torrey Horton. Had a big kickoff return last week. Makes a critical catch here to give him a chance on fourth and short. Charbonnet is the back. Fourth and inches. Give it to Charbonnet. Can he get the first? He can't. So the Cardinals were able to stop him. Just shy of the 50-yard line. Arizona getting the ball for the second time. 9-0-2 to go in the quarter. No score. There was 40 feet between them when they stopped. Dalvin Tomlinson, look at him in the middle against the rookie. just blows that up from the inside against Zabel. And then the linebackers are able to get downhill. Blow that up. Nowhere to go inside. He tries to bounce it. And there's your two linebackers cleaning that up short of the first down. So Donald to the bench. Murray comes back out. Start this drive from the 48-yard line. Running back, Trey Benson, second-year guy out of Florida State. And he'll be the number one guy now in the absence of Connor for the rest of the season. Knocked down. Trying to set up the stream. Dwayne Moffay, fourth year out of Minnesota, knocking it away. Second down. That's the concern with Murray, obviously, with the height. It's been a situation for him throughout his entire career. And something Seattle's tuned into, these quick throws. Like I said, he's second lowest target per depth per pass. and they're expecting these quick throws that time on the screen. Heck of a job. You can't get to them. That's the next best thing. Just knock it down. Second and ten. Rush four. Hangs in there. Fires over the middle. Oh, it's picked at the 32-yard line. Kobe Bryant brings it back to midfield and the ball is loose. And as they unfile. Cardinals signal they have it. Nothing yet from the guys that matter, though. I think his own guy knocked that ball out. I think Tyrese Knight, the linebacker, is trying to help him out. I think he ran into him and the ball came out. You need a bloodhound to figure out who has it. And they get lucky to the Cardinals. Yeah, watch this. He's got a heck of a play sitting there in center field. He looks back, but he's got to be looking in front of him because his own guy's coming back. He actually gets pushed. Gets pushed into him. The question becomes, was he down? His body is down. Was he touched to declare him down? A great look at it here. All turnover is reviewed. Is he touched? You don't have to challenge. They can look at this and try to discern. The ruling on the field was an interception followed by a fumble recovered by Arizona. Previous play is under review. All right, so take a look at it, a fairly long look here, and we will take a break with 8.46 to go in the quarter. The ruling on the field stands, first down. This is crazy. The ruling on the field goes to Arizona, right? Meanwhile, Seattle thought that the review was in their favor. The defense goes all the way down to celebrate in the end zone. It's not their ball. And Cooper Cupp had to run off from the sideline and say, Hey, guys, we're still on defense. Guys, we're on defense. Yeah, we got the interception, but we lost the ball on the fumble. That was crazy. Picked up five yards on the exchange. Arizona at the 47-yard line. To the outside, a lot of room. And a first down here for Trey Benson. Well, let's go back. You know, what got lost here is the throw by Kyler Murray. Look, they're showing a too-high safety look pre-snap to something that affects Murray post-snap. Now they're playing man-free. He steps up. Marvin Harrison stops on the route, and it makes it an easy pick for Kobe Bryant. So you've got man-to-man against Wolin, and he just kind of stops that little hesitation. I still don't know if he's going to be able to get his hands on that football, but nonetheless, they get the ball back and have a nice run there on first and 10. From the 35-yard line, snap a little low. Murray hangs in. Murray dangerous, of course. Getting away here is Benson. Turns into a little gain. Benson with a flag down. You're going to hear from Alex Kemp, the Knights referee, in a moment. Personal foul. Base mask. Defense number 27. That's half the distance of the goal line. automatic first down. It's on Reek Wollin. Of all the defensive backs on this defense, Wollin's the one guy that doesn't come up with bad intentions. Here at least he's coming up to be able to make a play, but that right hand got a little lazy there trying to finish on the tackle, and that right hand gets up into the face mask. So the Cardinals got a little momentum here. After the interception, they get the ball back, a couple good runs, and now the penalty, they're inside the red zone. Yep, not quite half the distance. As the ball spotted at the 16-yard line. Under 8 to play in the quarter. Scoreless at this point. We're going to flip it on the inside to Greg Dortch. Dortch is turned back to the inside. And stopped at the 14-yard line. Stopped there by Leonard Williams. The 11th year guy who several years with the Giants. Before that with the Jets. And has found a home here in Seattle. Seahawks one of the tops here in these first three weeks in the red zone. only allowing 40% of the time teams to score touchdowns down in here. Mike McDonald has a defense that keeps their eyes on the football. The windows get tighter, and they're so good at defending the run with that front four, and the linebacker's getting downhill. Benson going back and forth on a second and seven. Murray in the pocket. That's caught at the 11-yard line. Got a short game here. Trey McBride. The tight end makes his second catch of the night. His 19th of the season. Third and five. He has got to be a bigger factor this year down in the red zone. We saw a nice touchdown last week against Sam Fran. Need him to win down in this area because if he doesn't win, who else will? You'd think Marvin Harrison at 6'3", 220 could be that guy but someone's got to win like we say when things happen faster down in this red zone. Third and five. Harrison in the slot to the left. Got a flag here. False start. Offense number 73. Five-yard penalty. Third down. Jonah Williams, he is the right tackle. Just a small flinch by 73. That's what brings the vet Leonard Williams over. That's a small, that's a ministry. I was going to say, I might have to get a super, super slow motion. That's a touchdown if he decides to pull it. Third and goal. Keep it on the ground. And does he get in? Yes, with that second effort. Zach Charbonnet hit by Thompson. Looked like he had him stop for a second. first forward. And look, Max Melton, the corner, also got involved. And that's at 16. That's the guy that really hit him. Watch 16. Bang, right there. Doesn't wrap up. And that's what allows Charbonnet to be able to keep moving those feet. He and Walker, such a good combination. It's good to see Charbonnet back healthy. And that time using the power to get over top of that corner for the touchdown. Interesting, too, that Walker didn't play on this drive. He hasn't played since that penalty. That's right. Taunting penalty. So Charbonnet does the heavy lifting. Extra point now for Jason Myers. He's good. And with 61 seconds remaining in the opening half, Seattle extends its lead to 14-3. Division rival. Can you see Arizona's inspiration here, guys? the colors of the desert, as if they got caught up in a sandstorm. The Seahawks will show theirs off to us when we're there week 16 against the Rams. Yeah, it's all speckled. They look pretty cool. We'll return to the 27 here. This will be something that Nick Rollins, the defensive coordinator, and Jonathan Gannon won't like. Josh Sweat, who's a leader, by the way, was upset with something during a timeout about three plays earlier. Here's just a low, just not hustling to finish the play. If he finishes on that play, he's probably able to, Because of the effort by Milton, 16. He's probably, if he hustles here, doesn't give up on it. Right here. Keep coming. Keep coming. Now you can get there and, with your size and strength, pull him back. And there's Campbell, the vet. Two vets there talking about what they need to do to start playing better as a group. Bad time for no sweat. Oh, never mind. Murray over the middle. And it's almost picked. That time Julian Love is there. almost another interception. Well, these safeties don't feel any threat downfield, and because of that, you're seeing Love, who's thinking, I got 85, which way is he going to go? Now I'm going to jump it. He's not worried about anything that's going to go by him. There's no receivers. They haven't done anything tonight over their heads, so they're playing tight, and they're anticipating throws, and Murray caught a break there. Second and ten. Four-man rush to the outside. And that one is short, too. Mafe put the heat on. Well, the crowd is very frustrating with number eight. By the way, if you follow football, obviously you know Marvin Harrison is the son of Marvin Harrison, who caught 900 semi-passes from Peyton Manning alone. Yeah, obviously a brilliant career, and his son is very differently built, different style. Oh, but there's another example of he and his quarterback not on the same page. A lot of examples in the last four games. Third and ten. Dorch. And Dorch picks up the first down. So they don't have to punt it back here. They'll take a timeout. First down and ten. But they're on 37. So next week we're going to stay in the NFC West. We move over to L.A. next week. Danny Jones, right? Danny Jones getting done. Indiana Jones, they're calling him. Murray, sack, back of the 30-yard line, Leonard Williams. This defensive front, we've talked about it throughout this broadcast. You don't have a lot of time as a quarterback because they're only rushing four. They don't have to blitz. They're able to play zone. The windows are taken away, and then the pressure gets to you. Second and 17. They'll stop up at the 36-yard line. They have a timeout. But not using it, and the booze will rain down. Now they call the timeout with two seconds. Okay. Now what? Now what? I think a Hail Mary and hope for a pass interference call. Hail Mary, a couple of laterals. they knew coming in tonight without James Conner even with James Conner this is a really good defense Mike McDonald has a group that understands his scheme they understand the attack there's the divisional wreckers the Niners still undefeated and a bunch of two and ones but they Seattle won the toss they had the Birdmeyers to kick off Greg Dortch and Bam Knight are back to receive kick fielded at the two-yard line. Here comes Dortch. Out past the 20. Spun out about the 26-yard line. So the Cardinals now, who have been to the playoffs just once in the last seven years, Kyler Murray was the number one pick back in the draft of 2019. Could have played baseball. He was the number eight overall pick in the Major League Baseball draft by the then Oakland A's. and still amuses a little bit about what that baseball career might have looked like. Yeah, he lit up. He thinks he could have been an outstanding baseball player. Pretty, obviously, a special talent athletically. Kind of guy who might have stolen 40 bases this season, among other things. Start with a spread. Pass out to the left here. They go right to Marvin Harrison. We talked a lot about him during the pregame show. And now it's Marvin. As you call them Marv, what about Marv? Well Marv one of the things that they said to us especially after last week had a critical drop They said you know what we can do probably a better job of getting him the football earlier just to kind of let him settle into the game get his confidence established First play of the game, positive yards against a soft corner. Get him the football and let him get upfield. That's going to be a big theme tonight for the Cardinals, throwing the ball underneath. And with Connor out, the number one running back is now Trey Benson. They flare him out. The pass is caught on the left side here by Trey McBride, who's their top receiver. Great tight end. You know, you play with the Cardinals, and sometimes you're a little overlooked and underappreciated. He'd fit that bill. No question about it. You could put him right there in the argument with the top tight ends. You'd see what he's done with receptions in his first three years. Most all-time by a tight end, 22, 23, and 24, and off to an outstanding start leading the Cardinals this year. Soft coverage there again. And an easy quick throw for Murray. Benson is the running back. Give it to him. Tries to break the tackle. Stop there for Regino. And that a half a yard by Ernest Jones to pour it. When Ernest Jones gets going, he is tough. Special player. He did some good things with the Rams. Went over to Tennessee. The Seahawks were lucky enough to get him in a trade last year. really settled their defense down. Tremendous leader. Great communicator. That time read that one perfectly. Assisted there by Derek Hall. Really set the edge. Let him clean it up in the inside. Second and ten. Murray's going to keep. And nice tackle from behind. He has stopped. He almost got going by Derek Hall. Just talked about him. Stops him there. Third down and about seven. Yeah, you want to keep the edge against Murray for obvious reasons, and especially with James Conner down. You're going to see Murray have his hands on the ball all night. That time he's a heck of a play there to recover by Derek Hall, but one thing they know for sure, Drew wants to do a good job tonight of just getting the ball in his hands, whether it's run or throw, and his defense has got to keep him inside and let the inside of his defense chase him down. Drew Petsing is the third-year offensive coordinator for Jonathan Gannon. Deep drop. Murray keeps his eyes downfield. Murray throws downfield, and the pass is short. Michael Wilson was there. Had leverage to the outside. Kobe Bryant covering, but the pass is short for it down. That's about everything you really could hope for for Murray, because there was a lot of pressure. They walked up, see the defensive alerts that's saying who could potentially be coming on a blitz, and in this case, they all came. He's able to get away from it. Eyes in the backfield, so he's got separation. just a little bit more on that football, and Wilson's able to make a catch there in front of Kobe Bryant, but instead it's incomplete. Punt by Gilligan. Fair catch called for at the 13-yard line by Torrey Horton. A couple of minutes into the game in Arizona on this Thursday night. Nothing going on. Different teams now in eight seasons. Will this be a long-time home for him? Off to a good start early in this season. Start here from the 14-yard line. Kenneth Walker to the outside. He goes. He is stuck to the line of scrimmage. Second and long. Mack Wilson, who figures being on a lot of plays tonight, number two, makes that stop. Yeah, boys, he found a home out here in Phoenix with this defense. Leading him in the middle. A little tempo here from Seattle. Have four receivers set to the left. They go four by one. Pass goes that way. There's some blocking out there. Walker makes a catch. And Walker down the sideline for a long game. He sent four guys out there. He's only 28 years old and his eighth year in the league. I mean, think about what's ahead of him. One of the great, in the great tradition of USC quarterbacks. He's 28. Of course, we're talking about the parallel with Baker Mayfield. Baker is 32 years older. Darnold fires, and that's incomplete. And 10 to the day for Cubs. Arizona defense makes its best stand of the night. Max Melton with the coverage is fourth down. We saw two corners on this series make big plays. We saw Keytrail make a play against Chuck Clark against the run. Now this time you see 16 Melton with a quick reaction, anticipation where the sticks are, and he's able to work back to Cooper Cupp, thinking that that ball may come out and use that right arm to be able to swat that away with his length. Great play. Great series by the Cardinals' defense to get the ball back. For sure. Here's Dixon's third punt. Angles it. To the outset of the broadcast, how dominant this front can be, and we've seen that on display. Good job of playing zone in the back end. Allows him to keep eyes on the football. Here they actually bring Devin Witherspoon on a pressure on that last series to get the Cardinals off the field. But Mike McDonald in his second year as a head coach, second year calling this defense, much more familiar with what his guys can do. The guys are more familiar with the scheme. And this defense is playing as fast and as connected as any defense in the NFL. An offense that's gained only 115 yards to this point. McBride makes that catch. So this will be coming up the 39th play of the night. Make it the 40th. 40th play of the night for Arizona coming up. Their longest needs 17 yards. And if you look at this, seven of his 16 completions have been behind the line of scrimmage. Only thrown it twice over 20 yards. We knew that coming in, they talked about this being a space game. We've got to be able to find ways to get our guys in space and then make people miss with some yards after the catch. It's just been tough sledding against this defense. On second and six. Slings it to the outside. That's a first down. Trey Benson coming out of the backfield to move the sticks with four minutes to go in the third. Defensively, Mike McDonald, especially now working with this lead, but he's been doing it all game. Sitting back with his safeties and allowing the front four to create the pressure. You have five guys underneath just waiting to make tackles. to the sideline, and that's going to be Harrison. There you go. Who holds it in. Right, kind of a mock cheer coming out from the crowd. Reap Wallen on the coverage. And how about the ball by Murray? It's a back shoulder fade. He's adjusting back to the ball. Wallen never really sees that. He's in pretty good position. He just doesn't get his head turned around until it's too late. And good awareness and the footwork there by Harrison to get to his feet down for a nice positive game. Harrison caught a pass on Arizona's first offensive play tonight. His second grab right here. To the 32. Flea flicker. Look out. That didn't fool anybody. Two Hawks came in, including Josh Jobe, to take him down. Trickery in the seat will get you nowhere sometimes. Could not have come at any worse time. They brought the all-out blitz on the edge. Witherspoon here, Jobe here on the other side. And watch Jobe up at the top. Doesn't give up on it. Witherspoon's there as well. Good job of keeping their eyes on the football. Knew exactly where they needed to go to take Murray down. Not fooled at all. But a little razzle-dazzle there on first and ten. Seven-yard loss. Second down, 17. And again, just a four-man rush. But a big rush. Murray signals downfield and just hasn't taken himself. Just about back to the line of scrimmage. Third down and long. Well, one of the things with Murray, especially against a front that can get in and penetrate this quickly, is when he gets out, he needs help. And let's see how the receivers do here. It's right now. You've got to respond. Let's see if anybody works with him. Not really until Marvin Harrison turned and went on field, but they had him. They had two defenders on him. there's just nowhere for Murray to go with the football tonight. It's a combination of good coverage downfield. They're sticky, but also the receivers got to do a better job of trying to work to find some space. Got to get to the 22-yard line, and it just goes on and on. This time it's Dorch starting to look upfield, 4th and 17. By the way, on 3rd and 17, it is flipping it out there because of the respect you have for the pressure, trying to get that tunnel screen set up. but even if he catches that, that's about a two- or three-yard game. This defense flies too well as a unit to think that you're going to be able to pick up enough yards to even try to get field goal range, but they're still going to bring him out. A 57-yard attempt here. Chad Ryland missed a 57-yarder in the loss to San Francisco last week. This time from 57. The kick is good. So at least he settled for three in this 11-point game. Well, we knew Al coming in, Trey McBride is the go-to man, is it tied in? But the question I think we all had was between Marvin Harrison and the other group, who's going to help him out, especially when it comes to scrambling and just trying to make plays? He's going to be under a lot of duress. He's going to be looking to try to keep some plays alive. What I see is a lot of guys standing around. Nobody's really trying to play with some urgency out at that wide receiver position. It's almost like I'm supposed to run to this point. I'm running my route. They turn around, and Murray's running for his life. By the time they try to react, he's either out of bounds or down from the pressure. They came into this game, only a third of the pass completions for Murray went to wideouts. And tonight he's completed 18, almost all of them short passes, and only seven have gone to wideouts. 11 to others, the tight ends and running backs. 17-6. So Ryland, after that 57-yarder, sends this one to the one. Kalani, some room. out to the 33-yard line. He goes with a minute and a half to the end of the third. Well, one thing you don't have to worry about is the Cardinals defense coming out and playing with some energy, and Jonathan Gannon has these guys flying around. It's one of the more complicated schemes that you'll see. You sit there and watch film. You're rewinding it second time, third time, fourth time. There's Nick Rollis, the defensive coordinator, who calls the defense. They do a great job. They've got a lot of hybrid players, meaning guys that can do a lot of different things, which creates confusion. Because you have a hard time IDing Buda Baker and what his job might be post-snap. So it puts a lot on the quarterback from pre to post-snap. But these guys play with fire despite being down in this game, down 11. Walker. Well, that's pretty much Gannon got the job because he was Nick Ceriani's defensive coordinator in Philadelphia for two years. And then he gets the job. He knows he's got the job. There was a little bit of tampering involved, too, when they talked to him and they shouldn't have before the Super Bowl. But the interesting thing was he comes in. It should be the most exciting day of at least your professional life. And he comes in after giving up 38 points to Kansas City in the Super Bowl in this stadium. Tough one. Yeah. You said you brought up another one. Was it Kyle Shanahan? Yeah, right after the three-hour guy. Right after the 23-hour guy. And then he takes the job next day, right? Yeah, yeah. already preordained. Second and six. And that is incomplete. Intended for Smith and Jigba. It's a silent night. Third and six. He's run 17 routes, and that's the first time that they've targeted. Cardinals, part of this defense, they can do so many different things. The first thing that they think about as a defensive staff is, what do they do well? What do we want to try to take away? Is it a scheme? Is it a player? Tonight, it's been let's take away JSN, and let's make them beat us in other areas. Now, to the credit, the Seahawks had put 17 points up, but it's been a quiet night for number 11. Donald to the outside, and the minute you say it's a quiet night, he gets a little noisy, first out. They brought the heat there. They really dialed it up, brought one more than the offensive line, and the back can handle it at 7. So Sam Darnold knows he has to beat Buda Baker. Get it out before Buda Baker gets in there and keep your focus and rhythm downfield. And finally get number 11 an opportunity to make a catch in here on a third down. Great job of getting it out there and a heck of a job of concentrating to bring it in. Darnold, 13 completions to 8 different receivers. Walker. Runs into a wall for a loss. And that's going to take us to the end of period number three. Going to the fourth in Arizona. At least here they get the interference. Pass interference. Defense number 27. Ball is placed in the spot of the foul. Automatic first down. You know, you brought up a great point with Harrison before. And here's the foul. Yeah, grabs the arm right there. and obviously impacts Wilson from trying to get to his spot on that fade. But with Harrison, you talked, and again, I even mentioned yesterday, sometimes you think too much. It's paralysis by analysis. Well, yeah, and I think anything in life is about confidence and feeling good about yourself. He had an abundance of that in college at Ohio State, just knew he was the best player on the field. And right now he's still searching to find that in the NFL. Little things like the way he comes off the ball at the line of scrimmage, The way he runs a route, it just looks like a guy, I mean, in times, when I was watching film this week, watching him coming into this game, I thought, is he hurt? Like, he just doesn't look like a guy that's playing. They challenged him this year. They wanted to play at 1,000 miles an hour, play physical with that size. Second and eight, Maurice. Flag is thrown here. They got a hold there on the left tackle, Paris Johnson. Right. holding offense number 70 10 yard penalty second down Johnson there top pick out of Ohio State third year in the league yeah and you know he's coming off an injury miss last week and it's all about his feet when his feet are in position that he's able to be able like any tackle that gets out there isolated against a really good edge pass rusher and that left arm gets up around the neck right in front of the referee. Moves them back to a second and 17. Back at their own 44-yard line. Murray drops it underneath. Bents in. Tackle by the ankle. Drake Thomas with the tackle. Kaylee. Seattle's defensive line is not getting DeMarcus Lawrence back tonight. He came out of the locker room at the half in sweats. He gave me a nod, said, I'm okay. It's the quad. It comes with the territory, as it does in year 12, guys. Well, the one good thing for him, you get the mini-bias, so he doesn't have another game for 10 days. And Narusu getting healthier allows him to be able to get seven into the game for him, which is great to see him healthy and helps him get some depth there. Their next game against Tampa Bay. Undefeated at the moment. Third and 14. Murray getting chased. And Murray just has to fling that one. Halfway to Mesa. So, fourth down. Booze will rain down. Again, folks, this is a combination of an offense that's reeling. They don't have their best back and their leader. You're not seeing a young receiver making plays, not in sync. You've got a frustrated quarterback. But make no mistake, this is a combination of an offense trying to find itself and a really, really, really good Seattle defense. Blake Gilligan, this will be his fourth punt. First three have averaged 54 yards. Fair catch call for here. At the 13-yard line by Torrey Horton. Six and a half remaining in the third. Seahawks up by 14. To Las Vegas to be back reunited with Pete Carroll. And they went out and said, let's go get Sam Darnold. Right. You know, they made Smith an offer. He didn't like it. So off he went to the Nevada desert as Smith and Jigwood gets tackled behind the line. Scrimmage second down. But it's kind of crazy that you bring a coordinator in to work with one guy, and then he winds up working with another guy, and there's John Schneider, who's the longtime general manager of the Seattle Seahawks. You're right. It is funny, but I love how quickly they had to respond to Geno going another direction. They went out and said, who's out there that fits what we want to do? And after the year Sam Darnold had in Minnesota, they said, that's our guy, and he fits our system. Let's go pay him, and let's move on. So far, so good. Second and 11. To the outside. Reaching up his Cooper Cup and nowhere to go. He's covered there by Saban Collins, 3rd and 10. It is pretty remarkable to think about five teams that he starts with. And the guy is 28 years old. Think about what he's been through. Down. Myers puts it up. And Seattle takes a 20-6 lead. Nine and a half left in the fourth in Arizona. It's amazing. Nine-yard line, Bam Knight to the 27. So the defense we know is good, right, for Arizona. offense, minus Connor now. We talked about Marvin Harrison and all of the rest. You've been watching Conor Murray for a long time. Yeah. Uber talented. I think the one thing that stands out to me, playing that position is so much more than just the physical attributes. It's about raising your team, getting them to believe. Look at guys in his own draft class. Baker Mayfield, Josh Allen. Those guys raise the offense. They raise everybody, the coaches, the belief, right? That's the one thing that you'd love to see more of from, you know, just from Kyler Murray. Like, we know what he can do. We know how talented he is. But does he give you that same feeling over these last seven years that Josh Allen gives or that Lamar Jackson gives you? Another guy in that 18th class just gets your guys to belief. Well, that's the 18th. He was a year later. He comes in the next rep. But don't forget, as he finally takes off here, shows his speed down the sideline he goes, and he's finally out of bounds after a long game here. On a second down and seven off, he goes for 29 yards. And it's tough to do when you have a defense that's playing a lot of zone and keeping their eyes on you. See, the edge does a good job, force him up, and now he's able to finally be able to get into a foot race there with a linebacker and runs away from Tyrese Knight. First time we've seen him out moving. Again. When he run this time, yep. He might as well have been in that 18 class. Because in 18 they picked Josh Rosen. And then I think Kingsbury came in to coach the team. And one of the things Kingsbury said is, Josh is my quarterback. Unless I can get Murray number one. Which he did. Boom. Yep. Yeah, he's as talented of a guy athletically as you're going to see. Big arm. Has it all. That's the one part of his game, I think. Cardinals fans, I'm sure after seven years, that's the thing they want to see. Second and nine. Benson. Newt. Taking down there. Murphy. Byron Murphy, their first round pick out of Texas last year. Stops them third down and eighth. You're going to have a hard time running between the tackles this year. This defense stays healthy. An interesting call there on second down along. Maybe trying to catch him off guard, but they were ready for it. Third and eight. Fired, and that's caught. And, of course, it's McBride. Great job there locating. He knew exactly where he wanted to go with the ball. We talked about what a weapon McBride has been in this offense since he came into the league. And that time they just split to two middle linebackers and good quick decision by Murray. Seventh catch for him. Nice run here. Forward progress will take him probably just inside the 25. Trey Benson. Benson tonight, he's carried the ball a total of seven times for 29, make it 8-35 now. We talked earlier when they got close to the red zone how tough it's been in these first three weeks to score touchdowns down in this area against this Seahawks defense. Yeah, see if they can do it. Second and four. Action there and a flag. You got Wollin interfering with Xavier Weaver. Pass interference. Defense number 27. Ball's place in the spot of a foul. First down. Well, it's a good job of attacking Wollin because he just doesn't do a good job. He's locked up man-to-man. He doesn't do a good job of locating the football. Second time we've seen that where they've gone with a go ball and Murray gets hit right as he throws the football. Moffitt throws him down, but good job of finding the matchup that you like and going after Wool in there, who, again, struggling when they attack downfield, getting his head turned around and staying in sync with the receiver. Fourth and nine. First and goal. Tyler. Swallowed up. Takes the sack. the most so is there but joe took his receiver away he was trying he almost forced the ball to marvin harrison into the corner and he didn't know really what joe was going to do as a defender was he going to stay up or was he going to drop back watch him right out here he kind of gets into that gray area is he going to sit up then at the last second he drops so he decides to come off of it and then that's where you see the pressure close in on him. Second and goal. Harrison slot left. Murray. Murray to the end zone. Reaching left. Harrison has it. Touchdown. That is so much more than just a touchdown that gets you within a possession. That, you can almost see the relief from Marvin Harrison as he took a knee after winning this battle against the best Seattle has. That's Devin Witherspoon who can cover the best of them. Great ball by Aaron Murray. Great ball by Kyler Murray and a heck of a job here by Marvin Harrison. Finally high pointing a ball using his strength to come down with that football. One possession game. Ryland's extra point is good. So you've got 5.50 left in. Junior to be able to make that catch and maybe get that confidence back where it needs to be. And puts his team right back into the game. Fielded at the goal line here. Kalani. Off to the 22. And let's see what that Arizona defense can do now. And try to get the ball back as quickly as possible. It kind of reminds me of our game last week. We're up in Buffalo. And Miami, we just kept kind of saying, it feels like it's a lot bigger than a 14-point score. and then they got it to seven. Their defense kept them in the game, and that's what we've had here in this second half. Arizona with Jonathan Gannon is a defensive guru. His guys have kept them around just within striking distance. They get it within seven. 5.44 to go, all three timeouts. Let's see if the defense can step up again. That seemed like a lot more than a 14-point lead, which is now in peril as that pass is incomplete and nearly picked. second down by Jalen Thompson who was there had to go to the ground but the ball hit the ground first now think of this Nick Rallis the defensive coordinator who's a superstar and a future head coach they're working without their top three corners if you go all the way back to Sean Murphy Bunning who went out with a knee in the offseason Garrett Williams is on the IR Will Johnson the rookie top three corners out and this defense showing a lot of depth and a lot of fight tonight without him. Second down. Walker. Price his way. Gain in, let's say, five. The third down before your game. Third down and six. After that incompletion, interesting play call for Clint Kubiak. After you stop the clock, now you come back with a second down call and you run the football. Don't get a lot of yards. And now you're in a third and six with this crowd. We haven't heard the stadium this loud except for the halftime performance that we saw. Little John. You missed that. You were eating. No, I saw it already. Third down and six. Darnold. Deep downfield and reaching back is Smith and Jitba. Looking back, pulls it in along the sideline. The kill shot there on the third and six, 36 yards. What's better, the throw or the stutter and go? What a route by Jackson Smith and Jigba, able to run away from Max Melton. But heck of a job right over the outside shoulder. Right foot, left foot, out of bounds, and a first down where the Cardinals have some momentum. Crowds in the game, third and six. And Sam Darnold, look at the eyes, focusing on that safety. Saw him bite down. Knew that he had a one-on-one to the outside to his best receiver. He's had a quiet night. And he makes them pay for it for leaving him alone one-on-one. Eight different receivers. They've got Calais Campbell. A little shaken up and comes to the sideline now. Bearing the shoulder. He comes out. Meanwhile, now the clock begins to become a factor here. Absolutely. Trying to get a couple of first downs. If the Hawks do, make Arizona use their timeouts to have all three. That could be not just the play of this game. That's a third and six, and now you're already in potentially field goal range with your top receiver that they left one-on-one. Walker is the back. Because of that effort, that was five yards more that he got from where he was hit by two defenders. He missed from 53, Myers did. He's made from 44 and 31. Seahawks trying to make it eight straight over the Cardinals. Dixon to hold it. Stole to snap it. From 52. The kick wobbles. But makes it through. And the Seahawks win it at the gun. Wow, turned out to be some game at the finish. Arizona coming from behind. Came back from the dead only to see Seattle win it at the gun. 23-20, our final score. A little bit of everything here. What a job with the pressure on, with the snap, the hold, and the kick. like you said it leaked a little bit but stays inside and let's not forget the kickoff landing zone infraction they put the ball at the 40 yard line to give them the field position they needed to get into field goal range look of a man and a team that has lost back games in the last four days on last field goals That right 49ers beat them on Sunday and tonight the same thing happens Last weekend, there was nine or ten games that came down to that final possession. At the last moment of the game, it can't get any more exciting. And now to kick off this weekend, we give you another one here on Thursday night. What a game. Stay in the West next week. 49ers against the Rams on Thursday night. McDonald all smiles. Seattle goes to 3-1. Arizona goes to 2-2. They went on the rope. Charbonnet back in. Charbonnet to the outside. Charbonnet to the end zone. Touchdown. And the flag is down. And they got a hold here, I think, on Jackson Smith and Jigba, who didn't really need to make the hold. No. It's a touchdown. is right in front of the ball carrier. Oh. Ten-yard penalty. Be careful. That's a touchdown without the whole really good hustle play, but just unnecessary. It's Max Milton who's trying to come up, and then he grabs him. Terry, what do you think of that one? Bring you to the ball game here. Yeah, it looks like he reaches around and pulls him on top of him. Good call for Holden. Good call by Alex. Champ not to throw. You know, it's one thing if you say something in an open mic, but if the mic's not open, right, you get away with it. He gave him a look. He did. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. My kids make fun of me. I have four sons, and when they were younger, I used to give them this look right here. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Beautiful. Uh-huh. Okay. just a misdemeanor this time BYU got Jalen Thompson who moves down so he'll get up and go back to the sideline just to go back to our point a little earlier 11 point game a touchdown here makes it obviously really tough at a free possession game but if you can squeeze down here in the red zone and catch a break there with that penalty see if they can force a field goal keep them in a two possession game Jackson Smith and Jake was still talking to him. And Dad's saying, be careful. Be careful. It may have been a mini apology. I couldn't tell. He's a pretty chill guy. But ultra competitive. And with DK Metcalf and Lockett moving on, really becomes the leader now, along with Cooper Cupp on the outside. For sure. Walker. to the 8-yard line goes Kenneth Walker. So Walker, he's averaging close to 5 yards a carry. Darnold's averaging close to 9 yards per pass. You get that combo, you're normally going to win the game. Especially in Kubiak's offense, right? That's a great point because we came in tonight talking about you want to run the ball, but you're only averaging 3.3 yards a carry. That's 29th in the NFL. And tonight they've been able to get on track and then put Sam Darnold in this offense in such a great spot with, again, their play-action game. Three tights here. Two tight ends moved at the same time. All start. Offense number 81. Five-yard penalty. Second down. Well, only two of the three moved. It's not too bad. They second that and goal as they move this baby back now to the 13. Did we hit the emulman act yet? I can't wait. No, no, it is a little bit. It's coming up. It's coming up. Mark Tattleman's idea. A little history. Done a few. You've done a few ball games. Two Super Bowls. Seattle, Arizona. Right here. A 6-6 tie a few years ago. with a 15-minute overtime. Walker spinning, nothing. Taking all the way back that time. So it'll be third down and goal as they keep moving back and back and back. Zayman Collins was there to stop him. He wanted to spin and spin away. Here's Campbell up at the top. How about that swim move and the speed? He jump cuts away from Buda Baker right into the arms of Xavier Collins. So after that holding call, now they get him back. Now they're at third and goal. Again, remember how big of a series this is for this defense. Ball just inside the 16-yard line. Third and goal. To the outside. And that's defended very well. Cooper Cuff goes nowhere. Keitel Clark with the tackle so he'll have to settle for three which will keep it a two possession lead and now as bad as things have been for the Cardinals offense tonight this defense is fighting I mean they're fighting to the end and giving these guys at least a hope some hope that they can stay in the football game 31 yard attempt for Jason Myers Dixon put. Meanwhile, that kick was short, which means sort of the landing zone. So now you've got to bring it back out to the 40. By the kicking team. That's huge. Ball's placed at the 40-yard line. 40-yard line. Remember, they kick a touchback these days. It goes to the 35. They've got to put it between the goal line and the 20. That is short of it. There it is right there. There's your evidence. And that costs you another five yards instead of a touchback. Out to the 40. So now Seattle trying to get into field goal range. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS, it's about to win probability. I mean, this is a game that was, for the most part, over. Look at this. Lowest win probability tonight, 3.6. And here we are tied. Cup in motion. Smith and Jigler to the left. Darnold dancing, throwing, nobody home. 23 seconds. Matt Wilson put the heat on me. Well, that last Arizona drive 12 plays. 57 yards. Took him only 248 after Seattle missed that 53-yard field goal. You're looking at trying to get inside the 45-yard line to give Dixon a chance here. Jason Myers rather. You get inside a 45, you give him a shot. Second and 10. Darnold. From the sideline. Caught. And getting out of bounds. Smith and Jig. But they say no. The clock continues to run. Seattle has one timeout. And they're going to take it right here. with 12 seconds. Timeout, Seattle at 16 seconds. That's the third and final of the half. It'll be a 30-second timeout. It's a battle of former Ohio State wide receivers trying to make big plays to win the game. Jackson Smith and Jigla, much like his former teammate, back shoulder fade. Good ball again, good timing by Sam Darnold. Look where he puts this, and another DB that struggles to find the football. They're going to review this play to see if he was inbounds or out of bounds. If they rule him out of bounds, they're going to put a few more seconds back on the clock. He's out of bounds. He looked out of bounds, right? Terry McCauley? He's clearly out of bounds. They're expediting the review. They're going to put him out of bounds, and they're going to give Seattle their timeout back. So they get the timeout back. Right now it stopped at 16 seconds before they had pulled that timeout. Here it is. Good effort here, right? Stretch. The runner made it out of bounds at 18 seconds. Please reset the game clock to 18 seconds. Seattle gets their timeout back. They'll have one left. You get the timeout back to get two extra seconds. You've got 18 seconds. Right now, if you don't get another yard, you're looking at a 56-yard field goal attempt. So, obviously, the effort play here to get out of bounds not just stops the clock. As Terry mentioned, you get the timeout back, which we all know you want in this situation. You want to hold on to that last timeout. You never know what's going to happen. And Jigba and Kup. Kup is stacked on the left. Move him now into the slot. Timeout taken by Arizona, so that's their last. Timeout, Arizona, their third and final. 30-second timeout. Gave Gannon and company a look at how Seattle was going to line up. Now do you line up the same way or what? Meanwhile, Myers is 61-yard career long for him. He hit one over 59, 2-2 on 50-plus this year. And keep thinking about it. If you're just tuning in and you're like, what the heck happened? Arizona, their first nine drives, most of this game, 138 yards and six points. and the last two drives, 115 and 14 points, where Murray and this offense finally put it together, played with much more urgency. 18 seconds, first down. On the ground, spinning. Some tough yardage. Wow, it takes it to the 34-yard line. It's almost as if they're going to put this on Myers. foot sooner than later. Charbonnet carrying there. The three seconds. So now you're looking at a 52-yard field goal attempt. On the ground, bouncing. Take it down to the 38-yard line. Second down. And remember, it was the hold of Jackson Smith and Jigbaugh on the Kenneth Walker touchdown that prevented the Hawks from going up by three possessions. This game's over, so he has a chance to avenge that mistake, and he steps up and does. He's now the leading receiver. He went from, look at the first half. We were thinking, he hasn't had a target. And now, three receptions for 57 yards, almost 20 yards a catch. Darnold looking up at the clock. Takes this baby all the way down to three. Keeps it on the ground. Stop, 37-yard line. Now you've got a third down here. And obviously... Timeout, Arizona. Their first of the half. This will be a 30-second timeout. The big thing here is Clint Kouviak, because what's the call? If you throw the football, it shows the trust you have in Sam Darnold, right? because the last thing you can do here is take a sack. You take a sack, you're out of field goal range. You're in field goal range right now. You run the ball left to get it to the middle of the field and just maybe pick up a few more yards, maybe get it within a 50-yarder. Well, in today's NFL, I love it. You're in field goal range because you're looking at a 55-yarder. Exactly. Right? But you are. Right now, you're looking at about a 54, 55-yarder. Right. But I think the trust they have with Darnold, maybe it... See what they do. It's going to be interesting. Third and nine. It's Cup. Moving over to a wing. Keep it on the ground. Charbonnet. Tackled by the ankle there. That sets up fourth down. That sets up Myers' attempt at a field goal. Yeah, 52-yard field goal. Ho-hum, right? as you say, in the 20-25 NFL. But big, I mean, this is big. The Cardinals got within a possession, 340 and counting. So this is going to be a 53-yarder. Myers to try to make it a 10-point game. Under three and a half to go. and the kick is no good. And now the ball comes back to where it was spotted for the field goal. Nick Rallis, the defensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, and this Cardinals defense, as much as we bragged about Seattle, we really came into this game thinking it would be two great defenses going at it. They sure have stepped up. They force a 53-yard field goal, plenty of leg, but wide right. So Kyler Murray, with pretty good field position, pretty close to midfield, gets exactly what he wants with 3.16 to go. The last drive, I thought the urgency that they played with, it really put the Seahawks on their heels for the first time. So even though they don't necessarily have to, from a strategic standpoint, you wonder if they might use some of that same urgency. Plenty of time. 3-16. And two timeouts. Swings it out to the outside here. That is the third down back, DiMaccato. Making the grab here. DiMaccato out of bounds. Near midfield. In a six, second and four. Always got to factor in as a defense with Mike McDonald's group. We saw Kyler Murray scramble a couple times on that last drive. And the last thing you really can afford is to lose your eyes on him and let him step up and pick up yards like he did that last drive. Second and four to the sideline, reaching up. Does he hold it in inbounds? No. Michael Wilson on the chalk. Job covering. Back it comes to the 49, third and four. Got the right foot down, but his momentum takes him out of bounds. Unable to get the elbow or the left foot down. Tries to get the elbow. He's trying everything. Heckman ball, by the way, the location of it. But he is out of bounds because of the momentum taking him to the boundary. Third and four. You're in a four-down situation here. Two plays to try to get the first, if necessary. Murray throws. Drop. That was right there. That would have been a first down. It's McBride with the spoon. With the Seattle Seahawks leading the Cardinals. 17-6. Second down. 15. To the outside. Cooper Cup. Turns it into a nice little game here. Just let him make a third down and five. in a 10. We've seen a really consistent push up front from this defensive line. That time it was Jordan Burch, the rookie out of Oregon. Darnold, protection breaking down, but he steps away. Flag is thrown on the near side of the field, well away from the play. He's out of bounds. It's going to be defensive holding on Jalen Thompson defending Cooper Cup. While the quarterback had the ball, holding, defense number 34. Five-yard penalty, automatic first down. Well, they got him the third down, got a chance to get off to field. Tightened up, played man. Pretty tough ask of anybody to play Cooper Cup man-to-man. He wants to know what the heck did I do looking up at the big screen, but pretty clear he had his hands on him and pulled it down. Losing his balance and going to the ground. So it's an automatic first down. Sam Darnold not in any hurry at all. Going for 170 yards tonight. Averaging over 8 yards per pass. Always a decent number. From the 42. Attempted well. Dropped. Had it there. Kenneth Walker could not hold on. Second to ten. Can't help to be optimistic to think about this. If you're the Cardinals, is defensively take advantage of things like this. Ball is dropped. Kenneth Walker just starting to look where he wanted to go to secure the ball. But if you don't give up a touchdown here and you hold him to a field goal, and I know eventually you've got to score touchdowns, but at least it stays at a two-possession game. So they're rotating a lot of bodies. are trying to stay fresh on that defensive front where they have some depth. But they're thinking at the very least they've got to hold them to a field goal. Donald fires. Caught. He had the first down and then he doesn't. Then he does again. Smith and Jigba. Had an 11-yard game which he turned into a 9 and brought back to 11. First down. It's just really good rhythm again by Sam Darnold. He's really going to feel this defender and just try to negotiate. Is he going to? Yep, took the tight end. No problem. Got the answer. You see Jackson Smith and Jigbo work back to the football and still have enough yardage there for that first down. But Sam Darnold, again, with the footwork that he has, just great rhythm. Walker. backs his way for a pick of a four. I think the word that stands out if you're watching Darnold in these first, I guess, now four games is efficiency, which we saw a lot of until the playoff game against the Rams where they sacked him nine times. It was just really a rough day for him and their whole offense. But tonight, 15-21. You mentioned the yardage. 181. It's okay. One touchdown, no interceptions, in command, not making mistakes. That's exactly what you want when you have the kind of defense that this Seahawks team has. Walker again. Walker busts loose. Walker inside the 10-yard line. It will be a first and goal for the Seattle Seahawks. What I love here is they mix a lot of different personnel groupings. This is just old school, old school ISO here. Follow the fullback through that hole. and then use your vision. Where's the grass? Backside. And he does not blink. I mean, it is a quick reaction with the vision that he has. And then he has the acceleration to find exactly where he needed to go. Gets behind 72. Abraham Lucas, the right tackle. And with him running, you better sustain your block because he's liable to go anywhere. Breaks it up. Got a hand in there. Fourth down, fourth and four. They're going to go for this. They're looking at this with two timeouts and a two-minute warning. This is the series for them. By the way, Witherspoon, one of their best players on defense, read that and moved late to knock that away. Here we go. Fourth and four. Three minutes left in the fourth. McBride right there, the best receiver, best option. Harrison at the bottom. Timeout. Seattle, that's their first. 30 seconds in. Seahawks take a timeout. want to make sure they got the right D in in this situation well you asked me earlier about in the open about what does it take for the Cardinals to kind of take that next jump that next move right and this is what you want you know an opportunity like this with Kyler Murray and he's got to be able to come back and make plays like this on this kind of drive tonight's game changer presented by Novartis and we're going to look at the Seahawks This is a big play, a chance to go up by three possessions, a hold, which frustrated Jackson Smith and Jiglid with the right call. And then you have Marvin Harrison, another former Ohio State receiver, all hands. Great throw. He brings it down, has that exhale moment. That got him within seven. Defense comes up with a stop, missed field goal, and now here we are, fourth and four. Could be the ball game. Got to convert. But my point is, this is where Murray can elevate and take these guys to a different level. He's got to come through. They're three for three on fourth down this season. Wilson sets up on a wing to the left. Looks that way. Throws. One hands it. First down. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me with this catch? What a job, Michael Wilson. He barely gets his head turned around. And by the time he does, the ball is off of his right arm. And he secures it. First down. State inbounds. Here is Kimikato. And he'll get taken down. Julian Love stops him there. Gets eight. Second down and two. Two and a half to go. The running game going to the outside. It's so tough to run between the tackles. That time the center and right guard. Heck of a black by Isaiah Adams. Extra pressure. Murray trying to escape. He cannot. Gets spun down there by Drake Thomas. And that'll take us to the two-minute warning. With a third and nine next. 20-13. Seattle. Meanwhile, third down and nine. Huge play here. Well, actually, they've got, in this situation, clearly two chances to get the first down. Need nine. Number Harrison made the big catch. He's down at the bottom against Jobe, one-on-one. And Bryant comes under the slot. Nice little catch there by Dorch, who cuts to the inside of the slant, takes it to the 30. First down. Seattle brought the blitz. They brought seven guys, so Murray sensed that. So he just had to get rid of the ball, and he gets it to George, who's their most dangerous receiver after the catch. This is where seven years of experience pays off. Not in a hurry at all. Buck and a half to go. Pressure again. Extra man comes. Catch is made. to the 25 goes Harrison. Out of bounds, stop at the clock, 1-21. DiMarcado with a good block. Mike McDonald is not sitting back and playing a prevent, or the way they've been playing a lot of zone. He is dialing up pressure to try to get Murray off of his spot. The problem is they're losing some of the receivers in coverage. Second and five, they bring Michael Carter into the game as the back. Torch moving. Murray off his back foot. Incomplete. McBride is there. Looks for the flag. Gets none. Julian Love with the coverage. Now Love's going for the football. So he's entitled if he bumps into the receiver to be able to go up and make a play on the ball. McBride in, so there's no interference on either guy. just trying to both go up and make a play on the football. Look at Love's eyes. He's completely playing the ball. Third and five. What a moment for the Cardinals. What a moment for Kyler Murray. One of these teams will be three and one at the end of the game. The other drops to two and two. Harrison to the left side. Timeout. Arizona. Oh, the play clock was all the way down to two. 30 seconds. Not exactly where you want to use your time out of this. Not at all. But better than losing five yards on a third and five. For sure. But it would be nice to hold on to that. At least they have the one that they definitely need to hang on to as long as they can. Minute 16. I circled Marvin Harris because you brought it up. What an interesting night. You go from what's wrong with Marvin Harrison. This team has continued from last week into this week. and then he has the big touchdown catch. Maybe he gets his confidence back, and if you get him isolated in a one-on-one matchup, do you take a chance and give him one of those deep ball, you know, that slot fade? There he is in the middle of what was a three-receiver set. Now George comes to the right side. There he is in the slot. Third down and five. Murray going that way Making the grab Harrison Witherspoon covering on the play We just said the slot fade With a matchup without a safety over the top Give him the chance Let him use his body And what a place to locate the football again By Murray, back shoulder Let his receiver adjust to the ball 18 yards first and goal They can take their time. They don't want to leave Seattle any time if they don't have to. To the play clock. Inside 10. Handed off inside. To the line of scrimmage. Demarcato. Second down and goal. Jonathan Gannett's already. He's about to call a timeout. Seattle. Seattle called that. Now they're saving time. That's interesting. It's a very interesting goal. They want Marvin Harrison to play 1,000 miles an hour. They want him to play physical with his size, attack the ball. Here he is against one of the best, Witherspoon. Doesn't really locate the football. It's expected him to continue downfield. The ball brings him back on the back shoulder fade. Does use the body, but it secures that. We thought they might go there on that slot fade because there wasn't a safety over top to help out. Look at that second half. Six catches total. 66 yards. Second and goal at the seven. Four-man rush. Catch is made. Can he get to the end zone? Yes. Amari Demarcato. Now do you go for the win? Or overtime? I think with all this momentum, this place is alive. These last two possessions have changed everything. You want this game to get into overtime right now if you're the Cardinals. And we just challenged Kyler Murray. You want this franchise to change? Murray's going to have to make plays to get his guys to believe that we can win these kind of games. And he's done that. Ryland for the extra point. And the 28 seconds. 20-20. But you think about Marvin Harrison. You think about 85 to the right there. McBride instead out of the backfield. So, DiMaccardo, that's what he's known for. He can pick up the blitz. He can sneak out. Defense really loses it. And then it's a foot race there against Witherspoon, and he gets to the corner for the touchdown. So, DiMaccardo, he's been the third down back, but he has seen a lot of action in the last few minutes, much more than Benson has. This is... You find a way to win a game like this, not only is your record change, it's just, this is a big morale builder. But this game looked like it was over. You know, we were up here thinking, these poor guys against this defense, there's no way they're going to score a touchdown. And now the last two possessions, they put a couple up. You wind up having a good season. You go back to moments. And this would be one of those moments. Absolutely. Turn a sure defeat into a possible victory.
