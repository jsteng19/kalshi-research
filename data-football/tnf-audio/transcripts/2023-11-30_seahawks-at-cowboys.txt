 That game effort. Dak had rolled out. Here we go again from the seven on the first and goal. Prescott pressured. Coverage is good. Incomplete. And then Brown helps Lamb to his feet. Great collegial. Second and goal. They do such a good job with this scheme of getting five out. and you expect some kind of man coverage down here but they sit back and play more zone and that time working from the left to his right was Jake Ferguson to tie it in trying to come up with some answers here pretty well inside the 10 yard line pressure, fires, caught, wide open touchdown, Brandon Cooks Hawks bring pressure to get Fern. He with that look. They go 11 plays, 68 yards in 421. You nailed it, Al. I mean, how easy is this for Dak Prescott? You're going to bring the backer right here. Makes it pretty easy to be able to throw to Cooks across the middle, wide open. He's able to just throw it right where that blitz came from the backer. Here comes Jordan Brooks. Five coming, six covering. Wide open. Extra point here is good. Off the foot of Brandon Aubrey. Early in the second quarter, the Dallas Cowboys leading the Seattle Seahawks 17-7. And there he is having his best season in his eighth year. And the Hawks now 10 points in arrears. From the 25. Kirk. Well, Seattle came in tonight knowing they had to have a plan for Micah Parsons. What a move there against the run. Everybody thinks about him as a pass rusher off the edge, and he is. He's the most dominant we've seen in a long time with quickness and moves like this. Not always about him getting the sacks. It's about him affecting and this quarterback knowing where he is at all times. On our Zooms this week talking to Seattle, whether it was a coach or with Geno himself, first thing they find out, especially in passing downs, is where is 11 and make sure they account for him. For the moment, he's on the sidelines. Happy news for Seattle. That pass is caught. And trying to get that first down and coming very close to it. Might have it. Noah Fant. Side end makes his first grab of the night. And that is the first down. Yeah, and that time Shane Waldron giving Dallas a little bit of what they've been doing to the Seattle defense. A little pre-snap movement with Fant. Nobody really accounts for him as he moves from the right over to the left. to the easy read and throw out into the left flat. Charbonnet running right at him to the 40-yard line. Demarcus Lawrence making the tackle. One of the things that Pete Carroll, I think, wanted to do is run right at Dallas defense. Yeah, and we're going to keep an eye on this offensive line because we've talked a lot about Abe Lucas being back at right tackle. He's the starter. He's been out since week one. So he is out right now. And Peters, Jason Peters, who came in for Anthony Bradford for a couple plays. Bradford is good news. He's back at right guard. And Peters, again, a 41-year-old, is in for a series, taking Abe Lucas out. Give him just a chance to recover for a little bit. Passes low and not caught by Metcalf. Thinking about running after the catch. Couldn't hold it. Third and five. Yeah, this is kind of reminiscent of what they've been doing in recent weeks where it's just a ball that's a little low, a ball that DK Metcalf normally is going to catch. Geno's normally going to put that right on the money. They're going to pick up a first down. They love that glance round. But just off a bit, right? And now all of a sudden, instead of a new set of downs, now you've got a third down and five against this pass road. how many will the Cowboys send Parsons among those chasing him catches made breaking a tackle that's a first down Smith and Jigba the Ohio State rookie who fractured his wrist early in the preseason in fact in the game against the Cowboys and really just coming into form now. Yeah he sure is and you can see that what they like about him is what he can do after the catch. He's got such great ball skills and body control, but here's the power. He's a 200-pound slot receiver. You can see what he can do after catching that to get the first down. There's old Micah Parsons. Move him around, this time in the middle. Gets the edge there of Evan Brown and almost gets into the quarterback. Jordan Lewis, the slot corner was out there. Cowboys had three defenders. Lewis was trying to work outside to get outside leverage, and that's why Prescott ends up holding on to him. They're just trying to get the ball out to Jackson Smith and Jigba because he can make some plays, but now they get way behind the sticks. Number one goal of the night for Shane Waldron in this offense is to stay on schedule against his pass rush. Correction. Dallas has elected to decline that previous penalty. So it would have been second and 19, but declining it now makes it third down at the 28-yard line. Interesting call. Third and seven. Yeah, third and seven. Still a passing situation. They gave up the touchdown on the third and eight. I think it just tells you the confidence that they have in their pass rush. They moved now they moved Parsons out to the edge, but instead of being on the offense's left, he's now up here to the right. Interesting choice. Second and 19 to third and seven. Let's see what happens. Here's another flag. The catch is Tyler Lockett holding it in right in front of the bench. But we'll see about the penalty. I think he had a free play there. It looked like one of the Cowboys jumped. It might have been Dante Fowler, 56. So this should hold up. Offside. Defense, number 56. That penalty is declined. The play is the first down. Go back to the touchdown. What do you got to do against Dallas? You got to beat man coverage on third down. You got to hope that the offensive line can hold up and give you enough time for Geno Smith. and the receivers got to win and get off of that press coverage. And that time, really good job by Lockett being able to get the separation and give Smith enough room to make that throw. Metcalf started in the backfield, lines up outside on the left, handoff inside, and the rookie Charbonnet taken down there for a minimal gain. Goes back to what you kind of, I think, questioned when you're told, that second and 19 potentially, right? They declined it because I think the confidence that they have in their ability to rush the quarterback. But now we've seen twice. Seattle give Geno Smith enough time so it backfires on Mike McCarthy deciding not to take that penalty. Second and eight. Pete Carroll, age 72, still full of energy. Chomping on the plum, chasing the sidelines. You've got to love it. Second down and eight. Play action. Slides left. Down the left side. Metcalf! What a catch! DK Metcalf over Bland. So he picks on Bland again. Great catch. 34 yards. Bland has gotten so much attention as a second year player with the interceptions return for touchdowns. This is a veteran right here in Metcalf. Kind of a stuttering go. Watch the late hands. Bland never knows the ball is even coming to DK Metcalf because he never sold it by putting the arms up. 6-4 over the 5-11 Bland. Nothing happening here. On this run by Charbonnet. Stopped at the line of scrimmage. A little over two minutes to play in the quarter. Looks like we've got a guy down, an offensive lineman. Looks like he's going to get up. They've had a lot of injuries. That's Anthony Bradford, the rookie out of LSU, who's in at guard for Phil Haynes. They get Abe Lucas back, 72, the right tackle. At least he's back tonight. Jason Peters now is going to go out, who was last week playing part of that combination of right tackle for Lucas. He's only in his 20th year in the league. 20 years. How about that? On an offensive line. You know, it's impressive these quarterbacks play until they get to 40, but you see an offensive line minute, 41 years old, still playing. How about our boy Andrew Whitworth, huh? Yeah. Way to end that career, huh? Yep. Super Bowl ring. Peters takes Bradford's spot. Peters normally a tackle. Going to guard here. Give it to Charbonnet. Takes it to the 18-yard line. Third and about five. This Seattle offense, which has been struggling the last three or four weeks, they have got to be proud with how things are happening right now at the line of scrimmage. Again, on paper, it looked like a huge advantage for Dallas. But Shane Walton right now, between the pass game on third down, enough for the running game, giving them a chance here at third down and medium. Backing up, pressure, and that was Parsons who got in there. Got his hand on his foot, takes care of him there, fourth down and five. Eventually that coverage allows Witherspoon to get in there. Third and 16. Moving left. Prescott by a time. Settle for it underneath. And getting out to the 37-yard line goes Jake Ferguson. The tight end. Signaling first down. And he is correct. Well, one of the areas they have struggled is tackling in space, the Seahawks. And Ferguson is just a check down. You know, it's third down. Get the ball to an athlete who can make a play. And Witherspoon whiffs. Again, they're the fourth most missed tackles in the NFL. And a great shot there by the big tight end picking that up. Yeah, gain of 17. They need it 16. Prescott going deep downfield into good coverage. But it's so good, in fact, that it draws a flag. Tolbert, the intended receiver. And Woolen is back there. So they throw the flag, covered him very tightly, but perhaps too tightly, and Carroll's going to plead his case in the sideline, likely to no avail. I think he got him with the body there. Number 27, smaller place with a spotter foul for Shannon. Well, any time you go airborne as a corner and you don't time it up well because your head's not turned around, you know, right away it's coming here. He's trying to have make-up speed, and then his body gets to him. not so much the hand but I think the body onto the back there of the big receiver Tolbert you can say my bad right there my bad to the tune of 47 yards Rico Dowdell is now the back, he's in for the first time takes a little toss skirts the sideline minimal gain there, second down I remember last time they got down into the red zone especially low red, into the side to five. They could not come away with a touchdown. I'm sure they went over that with Mike McCarthy and Ryan Schottenheimer to make sure that they make the right adjustments and try to punch it in. Try to find a matchup. Pokes wide left. Pollard is the back of a fullback in the game here. Take to Pollard. Protected well. Fires caught. Touchdown, C.D. Lamb. Off the fake. Line does its job. Dak right on the money. Dallas takes the lead. And as we have seen in recent weeks, the movement of C.D. Lamb creates a favorable matchup. He moves. You see Seattle adjust. And then the inside receiver takes away the safety. and that's why he's able to make that throw to CeeDee Lamb for that touchdown. Auburn's at the point after. Prescott now with his 24th touchdown pass, tying Josh Allen for the league lead. 4.48 to go, first quarter. 10-7, Cowboys. Play on natural grass, and the Cowboys are going, oh, hold on a second. Wait now. Whoa, Nelly. Touchback. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, when I shared those numbers with CeeDee Lamb, he was surprised. He was not aware that there was such a stark difference between their performance on turf versus grass. He said it's not something that they ever talk about, and he doesn't believe that playing on turf gives them any advantage, but he conceded. I guess we liked her. Yeah, I'll say. And, Kaylee, think about this. They're battling for that one seed with Philly and the 49ers. Both of those teams play on grass. Yep. So how important are these next five weeks for Dallas trying to get that home field? And a tough schedule. From the 25, this drive starts. Play fake. Set up a screen. But that won't work. Tackle to the line of scrimmage. It's Tyler Lockett making the grab there. and Marquise Bell makes the tackle. How great a move is this by Dan Quinn? Had some injuries early in the year. They decided to move Bell down from safety where he played in college to linebacker. Keep in mind, he's 6'3". He's got length, but he's up 210 pounds. But Dan Quinn says with our system, some of the safeties and linebackers can be interchangeable, but he has great instincts as you see there in coverage. Second and 10. Three receivers to the left. Flag is thrown. You see that right off the bat. Jackson Smith and Jigba making the catch there, at least for the moment. The rookie out of Ohio State. Holding offense number 14. Ten-yard penalty. Replayed. It's on that. Yeah, you're looking at a 57-yard field goal from here. And clearly they go to the sideline. Nice play there. Lock it. That'll move them closer. Al, I have no idea why Bland would give him this kind of cushion. In this situation. Yeah, because obviously you want to get the yards, but look at this. And a guy like Geno Smith sees Al Harris, the defensive back coach. I think he's frustrated with that big of a cushion. That's just stealing and puts him that much closer to being able to get in the field goal range. Only took a handful of seconds off, as well as he had 13. You still have time for a play. You got three guys stacked on the left side. So, Smith, let's see if he looks that way. And he does. He's got to get rid of it in a hurry. And throws that one to the end zone. And the catch is Smith and Zygma. With a flag thrown. What else is new? But for the moment, the Seattle Seahawks have a touchdown. This is what Jackson Smith and Zygma does best. Defense number 26. Wow. It's amazing. I mean, Landis had such a phenomenal season, a phenomenal month, and they're going at them all night long. But tracking the ball is what this guy does. Oh, they're going to take a peek to see if that ball allowed to hit the surface, but did he lose possession? Did it move at all? Terry McCauley, what are you seeing initially? Al, it looks like he gets control before the ball hits the ground. And I think he maintains control. It appears that he does. There's some movement. But I don't see a clear loss of control there. You're trying to see any kind of movement after it hits the surface? No, any kind of movement. It's got to be clear loss of control. I don't think he loses control there at all. I don't either, Kirk. I think this should stand. and that's the call on the field so it would have to be reversed they call it a touchdown this would be some amazing drive if this culminates in a touchdown and an extra point to take the lead just because I've seen this guy do this so much out of timeouts why not take a shot this guy again he has elite ball tracking skills and then the ability to locate the football and go up and make a play on it Heck of a matchup against Bland who's been getting all this attention. And what a throw by Geno Smith away from Bland where he can go out and try to make this catch. So that's in. You've got pass interference in the end zone. If they overturn it. Look at. Beat Carroll Levin every second. Guy was a head coach of the New York Jets three decades ago. And Jigman mentioned that wrist injury. Remember, it is pass interference in the end zone if this is not a catch. Right. So it could come out to the one-yard line. And then it comes down to seven seconds. Right. And then what? Yeah. Yeah. We have time to float one into the end zone. Try for the TD. Got a chip shot three-pointer if you want it. Let's see. This is an interesting call, obviously. Don't have to tell you. This kid, this kid. Yeah? He's got a chance to be an elite player in the NFL, and I think people are just starting to see what he can do. He's an Ohio State guy, of course. Well, I mean. Hello? I told you, Garrett Wilson and Chris Salame, if you ask them who they think is the best Ohio State receiver of those three, they'd say this guy. If you don't know, Kirk Herbstreet went to. Have you ever dotted the I? No. No. Have you? You did Ohio State games back in the day, didn't you? Keith Jackson did once. Anyway. We're filling time until we get the, this is interesting. Obviously. Again. Terry, once again, you're sticking by what you saw. What do you think? I am. Now, they're telling me they're going to reverse this. Really? I believe there's a clear loss of control. I see ball movement. I still don't see a clear loss of control. After review, the receiver did not maintain control of the ball through the process. He's a little deep pass. Out of the house, mass interference. Defense number 26 in the end zone. I think they forgot about the interference. Now the booze come. Yeah, the crowd thought it was all coming all the way back. Forgetting about the flick. Third pass interference call against Dallas tonight. All right, so now, I mean, you have to throw one into the end zone. Hope it's caught. And stop the clock on a new complete pass. First and goal. I'm going to loud in coverage. And a half by any player all year for any team. And as I say, he just won the Defensive Player of the Month award in the NFC. Second and eight. That is caught. Smith and Jigba lunges up to about the 33-yard line. Tackled there by Bland. It's a very busy night. Third and a deuce. All we've heard about is just Seattle needs to find an identity. What's the Seattle identity? Is it three tight ends? Is it drafting a great receiver like Jackson Smith and Jigba going to three more? Three receivers? Do they want to run the ball? Well, tonight I think we're seeing that identity come to fruition. And Pete Carroll and Shane Waldron, they've found some answers as far as throwing the football, mixing up the looks, moving Geno Smith around, and finding different options to go along with that running game. Team that came into the game having scored only one touchdown in the last two games. Meanwhile, the catch is made along the sideline by D.K. Metcalf. For first down up to the 46-yard line, he goes tackled by Stephon Gilmore. And this is how you answer a great pass rush. You're going to take advantage of the soft corner. Gilmore's a talented guy, but he plays off. Okay. Third down and short. That's why you want to avoid those third and sevens and third and eights. Try to live in that third and three, third and four. Corner soft. Geno Smith is a veteran. Sees that pre-snap. Takes it. Easy first down. Churvin A. His best run of the night. he goes to the 41 yard line well there it is there is Abe Lucas back in this lineup everybody's talked about what kind of difference would he make you'll see him up at the top 72 come down he'll help collapse that right side with Bradford and that allows the pullers to be able to come around and they look at that he just talked about how he doesn't have a ton of yards but they're starting to wear on this undersized Dallas front a little bit gain of 14 you saw fan pulling making A nice screen block there. Ball at the 40-yard line. Give it to the rookie again. Charbonnet. Around the corner. He goes. Got a flag coming in. 33-yard line right in front of that Seattle bench. You saw them all running up there saying, hey, you saw that, didn't you? I think it was Bell. Marquise Bell grabbed the face mask. Great blocks on that edge there. Famped the tight end. Crossed the left tackle. Even DK Mettaf gets involved, makes a block on Curse. And this is near the end of the play where Bell gets that left hand up there. So just like that, and we just settled into our seats. They're in the red zone already. Yep. That's the fifth first down by penalty for them tonight. Dallas with 122 penalty yards. As mentioned at the end of the half, these two teams, the two most penalized in the league, and they're living up to it tonight. 18-yard line, first down. Smith fires a little too high and incomplete. Trying to get it to Will Disley, tight end first time. He's been targeted tonight, second and ten. So what's the identity? We talked about there will be a three-receiver set. This time you've got three tight ends. All three of them are in there. Disley and Parkinson. Parkinson gets free. just gets lost in coverage, and Geno Smith, as good as he's been tonight, misses a wide-open target. Backbiting his time in a long time since he's been out. Second out of ten. Lockett going back and forth. Pass is caught outside the ten-yard line, and Metcalf's big night continues forward progress. We'll make him a first down. It'll be first and goal and a lot of action after the play was whistled dead. Ball coming out there. And Evan Brown scooping it. Damone Clark's eyes are on Geno Smith. He's got to get his head on a swivel and look for where is a potential threat. He doesn't look out to his left until the ball is in the arms that time of the intended target, D.K. Metcalf. So he's growing in the middle of that defense. You know, he's a very physical guy. It's good to see him healthy and able to take over wearing that green dot. But that time, just no awareness defending that area there in coverage. Through the middle. Charbonnet, a right guard. Damian Lewis pulling. Short game. Second down and goal. Four minutes into the second half. Really starting to like that counter play. Getting a good push on one side. Try to open it up with those pullers coming around. I think people in Dallas, Seattle punches it in here. Here we go. Here we go has become his Omaha. To the end zone, reaching up, can't hole it in. Is Jake Ferguson the tight end? And again, it's Wulin back there, covering on the play. Le Fay came in and forced the issue in the backfield, third down and ten. And this is where his size really works out for him as a corner at 6'4". It's not just him on receivers. You can put him with that length and see that left hand again is able to get in there and get his hand on the football and knock it away. Spelled like it should be Wollin, but he prefers Wollin. And he changed it to Reek this year as well. Turpin is in the game right now. Third and ten. Prescott. Good protection. Fires to the end zone. Making the grab. And about the two-yard line there is Turpin. Kevante Turpin, the kick return, plays sparingly on offense. And a flag is down at the eight-yard line. So our first penalty of the game, we'll hear from Cleet Blakeman for the first time. Again, how about the protection here by that offensive line? Just all day to throw the football. Pete Carroll leaning into the call. Illegal contact on the play. The little play is a first down, Dallas. Okay. So we have a flag, but no penalty. No, he called off. Waved it off. Here's the time. Look to the far left. The defender drops. He has an open Gallup right there. If he would have saw him, he gets back to that side late. But when Gallup freed up, the defender goes down. He happened to be looking and surveying the field and working his way back to the right. But eventually, with that amount of time, Dak Prescott's going to find one of his weapons. First and goal. 11th play of the drive. Pollard. Can't get past the line of scrimmage. Second and goal. I think that's the one aspect of this offense that we're going to continue to see as they get ready for this stretch run. You know, Zeke Elliott obviously is no longer here. Pollard takes over coming off that injury in the playoff game against the 49ers. And he's known more really to catch the ball to the backfield, work the perimeter with a toss sweep. But they've got to still have that ability to run physical in situations like this between the tackles. Dak rolls away. Has that one knocked down? Devon Witherspoon, the sensational rookie, having a great year. overall number five pick in the draft. Played as College Bowl Illinois. Knocking it down, third down and goal. This kid continues to show such versatility. He can cover, he can blitz. Here his instincts and football IQ pays off for him. But watch how quickly he gets on deck. He doesn't mirror him, he attacks him. And he doesn't quite get to him, but he's so long, he's able to climb up and knock the ball down. Kevin Witherspoon, knocking it away, third down, goal. deep drop and they get him so Prescott gets sacked by Jordan Brooks who ran one back for a touchdown in the Thanksgiving game against San Francisco so all of a sudden they're rolling here we go here we go all the way down the field and the field goal unit comes in yeah and Steel works outside which forces the back Pollard to be able to pick up this this potential blitz right there. See, Steele's kind of waiting and waiting. I don't know if that's a mix-up, but clearly it's overwhelmed with that physicality there, Brooks. 30-yard attempt for Aubrey, who hasn't missed the season. He's 23 for 23 for the 28-year-old rookie former soccer player. So the Cowboys get a first and goal settle for three. 3-0 Dallas. They've been in the news. Mark Cuban selling off about $2 billion dollars worth of the team. That's been the headline in the papers the last couple of days. We start with a touchback here. And that Seattle defense gave the offense a little burst of adrenaline there. Looked like, you know, it was going to be 7-0. Held them to a field goal. And now the offense trying to score their first touchdown in seven quarters. There are the numbers on Geno Smith, the comeback player of the year last year. Smith now in his 11th season in the league. Keep in mind, this offense has been sputtering seven consecutive quarters without an offensive touchdown. They need to start much faster tonight. Running back is Zach Charbonnet. Kenneth Walker is not active tonight for the second week in a row. And Charbonnet will play two years at Michigan and then finish up with two years at UCLA. And he'll be the main man tonight. Gaines for a second and six. He is a physical back. With Kenneth Walker not being in, you lose that big playability, but you pick up balance, patience, just a very physical back. I think a lot of people have not really seen him play. You'll be in for a treat if they can open up some running lanes for him. Second and six. Give it to him again. avoids Parsons who will spend most of the night in that Seattle offensive backfield gets around him and picks up a couple to the 31 stop by Hankins there 34 you often associate Parsons with quickness to the outside here he gives that step to the outside and then bursts back underneath Charles Cross you cannot predetermine where Levin's going to go not just as a pass rusher but defending the run it's fun to watch as a pass rusher again they move him around. Right now he's lined up right across from the center instead of being outside. Here he is right here. DJ Dallas now in the back and we've got movement up front. So that's Demarcus Lawrence coming across the line but Fleet Blakeman do tell us in a moment whether he was induced. False start. Offense number 63. And he was. I think he responded to Anthony Bradford just turning back to to give the touch to the center that we're ready to go with a snap. And I think he was just so anxious to get a good getoff that the head, the center looks down, the guard moved just a bit, and Lawrence jumps. Third down and eight. Smith fires over the middle. Great grab by Metcalf out in front, and he will go all the way for a touchdown. 73 yards. DK Metcalf, so they haven't scored since the first series against the Rams in the next to last game, and they score with an exclamation point halfway through the first quarter tonight. What a job by Geno Smith on his third down and long. He does a good job of looking at Donovan Wilson, who works out and back to the inside after the snap. He sees that, knows he's got that seam, and puts it on a line. Watch Metcalf work Bland, who's getting a lot of attention outside, gets that separation, and then it's just all speed after that catch. Jason Myers to the point after. So Bland just won defensive player of the month for November, but obviously the voters didn't count November 30th. 7-3 Seattle. 7-28 to go in the first. Mike McCarthy. It's the first time the Cowboys have trailed at home all season long. And the Cowboys will set up shop at the 25. Yeah, they knew coming in they'd have to win one-on-one here on third and eight, Metcalf against Bland. But I love the safety movement there. And the reason that's important is because it creates basically a one-on-one matchup for Metcalf against Bland. Everybody's been wondering, what's wrong with the timing and the rhythm of Geno Smith? Watch him move that safety with that little subtle look, enough to move the safety to the middle of the field. And that's what gave him that throwing lane. And then it slides out once Metcalf makes that catch. Perfect. over 22 miles an hour still as fast as ever in his fifth year in the league here goes Pollard into the middle of that line for a gain of two second down and eight it's the beauty of the NFL you know there's just no foregone conclusions you look at this game on paper the way Dallas has been playing in the last five weeks the way Geno and this offense has been playing they've lost three of their last four everybody's talking about boy they're in trouble and a long way to go but you can just tell the Seattle team, they've shown up with competitive spirit. See how it goes from here. Second down and eight. Off the fake. Prescott under pressure again. Sacked from behind so they get it for the second time. Carroll Taylor that time. With you out of Tennessee. Taking care of him. So down goes Prescott for the second time. Third down and 15 now. And we talked about Witherspoon, the rookie, and how versatile he can be in coverage. He can play man, and he can blitz. It's really an assist to the coverage downfield. Dak Prescott's back there. Hitch, hitch, hitch. Everything's covered. Really good protection. And out to the 33-yard line. Of course, Dallas has two timeouts. They could use them two. Of course, they are likely two if they don't pick up the first down here. It's all right on this play right here. Third down. If they're able to pick a first down up here, They'll go to a different level of urgency. They're trying to get one of the linemen back in the huddle, Anthony Bradford. It interesting the clock usage here You don want to go too fast If you don make it you leave Dallas enough time So the clock keeps ticking down 48 And that pass to the outside and that a first down as the catch is made there by Smith and Jigba And so with 41 seconds right now, they will take the ball at their own 43-yard line. And that's the matchup they've got to try to work. Jordan Lewis is, you know, back from an injury, the foot injury that he had last year. and this rookie kid, if he gets one-on-one like that, he can do that kind of damage all night long. And plus he gets out of bounds. Here comes Parsons. Smith escapes. Low throw, flag thrown, and Jigler went to his knees. Incomplete to begin with, and a flag. in a conference. I think five officials are in there. Supreme Court ruling. Dallas is offsides as one of them. Meanwhile I could use that right there We all could Demarcus Lawrence There we go contact Number 21 That penalty's declined Offsides Number 92 It's a five yard penalty Remains first down for Seattle Alright there you go That was Jaron Reed Who was getting Yeah, they get a first and five with the offsides. Instead of taking the defensive holding, you'd be a first and ten. So smart decision here by Seattle. And, you know, not very far. They get in the field goal range. What a stop by their defense. And a good job, again, utilizing their timeouts. These are the two most penalized teams in the league coming into the game. and living up to it tonight. Nine total calls. Smith fires. Incomplete. Tended there for Tyler Lockett. Second and five. Now you get 31 seconds. When you put two or even three offense alignment on number 11, which at one point, watch him. He's down here. Watch how you get two, and then the center comes over, and now 92 to the middle. You have Lawrence who's one-on-one. 92 gets one-on-one. And it forces, even though, again, they don't get the sack, but it forces these other very capable pass rushers to get chances because you pay so much attention to what Micah Parsons can do. Second down in five, 33 seconds. Play clock at two. Little lofted pass here. Next to nothing as D.J. Dallas makes the catch. And that took a few seconds. The flag is down again. How hard is it to run a two-minute offense against his pass rush? Especially when they're offside. Yards enough for a first down. Yeah, so it was second and five. So that's a first down now. It's on Fowler. Spots the ball at the 47. See Fowler's hand at the top helmet. I mean, they have so many pass rushers. You got 90. Lawrence. You got 56. Fowler. Not just about Micah Parsons. In the pocket. To the outside. And rolling. And that pass is caught. Better hurry. That's Tyler Lockett. Stayed inbound so the clock keeps rolling. 18-17. Spikes it here. 16 seconds. Now it's gutsy call here. decision for Pete Carroll. He's going down talking to the special teams coach. Because, you know, if you don't get out of bounds, you're out of time. Sprung loose to make the grab and picks up 12 yards in the first. They designed this with movement inside to be able to move the tackle down. And now it's just up to Pollard to pick up that blitz. One-on-one, who's going to win? Good job of Adams not giving up on the play. but how about the heads-up play there by Dak Prescott? He had nobody downfield. The pressure's on him, and he just flips it there to his check down. Powered out for a moment. Go five wide here. Flips it out into the flat and incomplete. And right there was Witherspoon to take down Turpin. As the ball arrived, second and ten. so many different ways they can attack you you get caught up in thinking about C.D. Lamb you got to worry about the tight ends Ferguson that time working the seam to try to get downfield there's Cooks, there's Tolbert, there's Pollard an offensive line that gives him time not to mention he's got legs, he can scramble away from the pressure Seattle takes its first time out this will be a 30 second time out A couple of minutes into the second quarter. Meanwhile, you're talking about the upcoming schedule for these teams. Cowboys, of course, are 8-3. Philadelphia here away from Sunday. Then they go to Buffalo, to Miami, and Detroit comes here. Tough. Think about these games. If you're Dallas and you want to show you can play with the big boys, you want this. Philly at 10-1. You got Miami at 8-3. You've got the Lions at 8-3. It's all about winning games and trying to secure that home field advantage for all these teams. But it's right in front of Dallas. Well, they're 8-3. It's week 13. They still haven't beaten a team. They've faced with a winning record. They could, though, tonight. Here's the Hawks at 6-5. Second and 10. Delay here. Nice run. Bouncing his way. Dowdle. Rico Dattel, he's been around for a while, but seen more action this year, fourth year, out of South Carolina, making a third down and two. Yeah, a guy that was really more of a special teams guy, you know, especially going back to 20, didn't play in 21. Special teams again, and with Zeke Elliott moving on, not only does Pollard move up as the premier go-to guy, Dattel now becomes what Pollard has been. Kind of that second option, much more physical, as you saw in that run there. It's a little helmet repair. Third and two. In the pocket. Fires. Caught! Lamb tries to get into the end zone. Comes up a yard shy. Diggs saves the touchdown for the moment. First down and goal. Just a great job of being patient here by Dak Prescott. He worked left. He comes all the way back to his right. And a flag. Yep, an elite flag here. probably defensive holding. Gallup had to really work. There is no foul for offensive pass interference in the play. The play stands as the first downer. Second downer, he had a flag. Picked it up. Watch him go left. Look at Ferguson and Cooks. He sees, okay, that's taken away. And instead of panicking, this is where Dak Prescott is now. In the past, he would rely on his feet. Now he's relying on this scheme with Mike McCarthy and Brian Schottenheimer. and a good job of being patient as a receiver himself. And C.D. Lamb going out and then back underneath. That says it all. On the Seahawks' sideline, first down and goal. You've got Lipke in there as a fullback. You've got Pollard as the running back. In the motion, Prescott will keep it for the moment and then just throw it away. Second down and goal. Another flag that came in. And another flag thrown. They go man downfield. Checking with Pete Carroll. Aneldo man downfield. Offense number 73. It's a five-yard penalty. We play first down. You don't see too many illegal men down the field from the two yard line. You really don't. The big man right here, Tyler Smith, who's just a dominant player inside. He gets engaged, and now you've got all the way across the goal line there. I think Mike McCarthy saying exactly what you just thought. He said, what the? How did that happen? Back to your Super Bowl. Seattle, first and goal with a one. Malcolm Butler is not in the stadium. That pass is caught. Touchdown. Noah Fant, the tight end. Looks like Dallas got a timeout before the ball is snapped. Wow. Oh, man. And right before the snap, Mike McCarthy got the timeout. Wanted to see what they came out in. And called it just before the snap. They'll put those two seconds back on the clock. You know, you hear about icing a kicker here. He just, like in a basketball game, they just wanted to see their formation. Wanted to see what they were going to come out in. And give him credit. He got that timeout in. So you still have those seven seconds. Smith and Jigler. Comes off the bench. thought he had the touchdown to make it 20-20. Sets up wide to the right. That's the matchup that they would look for. Lockett's in the slot. Metcalf the other way. To Metcalf. He hauls it in. And is there a flag down at the three-yard line? There is. Here's Blakeman. Offside. Defense number 90. Kelly's applying. He's going to play for touchdown. This works. Pete Carroll, at the end of this half, has put together, given his team a chance to put points on the board. They hold them to a field goal, and then they're able to drive and get points on the board. Give credit to Geno Smith and his offense, and Bland has had a rough first half. The big touchdown early to DK Metcalf for 73 yards. Another big completion at DK. Looked like a touchdown to Jackson Smith and Jigga, but it's pass interference, and now a touchdown here again. Extra point is good. So this is going to be the ultimate two for one. They're going to get the ball to start the second half. In 90 seconds without a timeout, they just went 75 yards, eight plays, one rush, seven passes into the end zone. Incredible job. And as you say, two for one. They get the ball to start the second half. And here's Bland, who's gotten so much attention for the right reasons. He's playing great for him, but tonight, Seattle's gone after him. Different receivers. D.K. Metcalf has had some big plays. Here, there's an early touchdown, and this we thought might be another touchdown, but they're getting him isolated. He's playing man-to-man. It's a tough thing. Dan Quinn asks you to live on an island, and when you've got a quarterback that has time to throw and he gets into his zone and finds that rhythm himself, he's going to make some big plays, and that's what's happening. And Pete Carroll on the sideline. I mean, how great was that to watch him coach the Jets 29 years ago, three years in New England, then at SC, now in Seattle for over a decade. Unbelievable energy, dancing, chewing that gum. Yeah, and a masterful job of using those timeouts. Not waiting, not hesitating, had a plan when his defense was out there, getting those timeouts called to secure as much time as he could for Geno Smith. Bouncing ball. This is going to take us to the finish line unless we have the craziest run back in history. And the way this game is going, who knows? Anyway, stopped at the 35-yard line. That's the end of a wild and crazy first half. 21-20. Seahawks on top. State Farm halftime show with the gang coming up right after the break. Obvious passing situations. Pete enjoying a light moment with the officials on the sideline. Off we go in the second. half in the first game of week 13 with a touchback moments ago. Kaylee with Mike McCarthy. Well, Coach, you've scored on every possession. You've dominated time with possession, but you guys are trailing. What are your priorities in the second half? Well, I think just like anything, you've got to focus on yourself. We've got to clean up the penalties. We've got to score touchdowns in the red zone. Seattle has gone right after Deron Bland. What adjustments do you want to see to make? There's a lot of football left to be played. We're excited to go play. Thank you. I think Mike was a little show-shocked the way that first half ended. 25-yard line. Smith going to work. Charbonnet. That's nothing doing for him tonight. Ten carries for the rookie. 24 ground yards. I think Kaylee asked a great question just because Bland has had such a great year. But that first half, eight targets, six big catches 237 yards and a couple of scores had that interference that set up that touchdown at the end of the half it's the most yards from the 49 play fake, throws on the run deep downfield, contact made flag thrown, and looking for that flag, getting that flag, Rashad Evans ran right into Tyler Lockett, and that'll take Seattle deep into Dallas territory you move in Rashad Evans who hasn't been there long. Defense number 32. Molly Plays in the spot of the foul. First down Seattle. He is a veteran six-year guy. This is the penalty. Never locates the football. Lockett doing his best work to try to get back to it. Obvious interference. But watch why Evans got in trouble. Eyes in the backfield off to play action. It gives Lockett a chance to sneak behind him with his speed. No chance with Evans slow at the line of scrimmage to get back in coverage. Earlier, Dallas had a 47-yard penalty. Again on a 47-yard penalty. Here's a gain of 40 for Seattle. On a first and goal, Smith lofting one to deep. Incomplete. Second down for Smith and Jigba. I think that's where Geno Smith, I think, is getting more and more comfortable with Jackson Smith and Jigba. Because early in the year, I know he had the injury, but I think they were trying to find that timing and rhythm. A lot of his routes were short and underneath. Last few weeks, we're starting to see what he can do. Really, his strength is getting downfield and winning one-on-one against that slot corner. Oh, that didn't fool anybody. A delay. Izua comes in to make the tackle in the backfield. The minute that Charbonnet got the fall, third and goal. You talk about a tough ask for Evan Brown to center. You're pulling around Damian Lewis, the left guard. And when the guard pulls, you're giving him the leverage to be able to work around. With Diggy Zua, he's a high school wrestler, tremendous athlete. Think about this, 280 pounds, so he's undersized. But you can see he uses that quickness to his advantage. Yeah, throw that play out of the playbook. Third down and goal from the 14-yard line. Smith to the end zone again, and that's incomplete. And looking for the flag, and there's a flag. They threw it. Stephon Gilmore first time they threw one his way tonight no stranger to the Pro Bowl and in the league 12 years crowd doesn't like it meanwhile the officials now discussing not another flag gonna pick that right defense number 28 solid a couple times the ball he plays at the one yard line first down Seattle You called that one on Malik Hooker. Yeah, I think it's 21, not 28. Correction, the fouling player's number 21. The big thing on these routes is, does he hook him? Does he grab onto the waist? Does he grab onto the jersey? Once he gets to the top, there's a grab right there at the top of that route. A good call. It wasn't at the end. It was right at the stem, right at the top of the route. Fourth defensive pass interference call of the year against Gilmore. First and goal. Charbonnet, he gets into the end zone. So the Seahawks showing some grit, trying to snap a two-game losing skid down by 10 and make it a three-point game if the extra point is successful. We talked in the open about Pete Carroll bringing a football team in. It felt disrespected and angry, and they should, just because of the way they played against San Francisco. They had lost three of four. Dallas had been playing as well as anybody in the league, and they knew that they had nothing to lose. Let's get aggressive. Let's take some chances. on offense, and let's get back to an identity. Taking shots downfield and running the football. That's what they've done. Yeah, Charbonnet took that ball to the sideline. That's his first career touchdown. Kid who had, what, 11 as a freshman at Michigan? He's used to getting into the end zone. The extra point is good. Off the foot of Jason Myers, and with a little less than nine minutes to play in the first half to Dallas Cowboys, leading the Seattle Seahawks 17-14. Obviously they became one of the stories in sports in September and then faded. Won the first three, lost last eight. Yeah. And we go to Kaylee. Well guys, since Mike McCarthy took over play calling duties here in Dallas, I am told his staff had to redo a lot of his schedule. And every day for him is different this year than it was last. He spends a lot more time, I'm told, with Dak than people even realize. Oftentimes they are the last two guys to walk off the practice field together. Jerry Jones likes to call Mike McCarthy the busiest man in Dallas. Yeah, no question about that right now. Fourth year here. A lot of success in all of those years. Almost 13 full seasons in Green Bay. His team up by three. Start with a run here. You know, for McCarthy, he loves this venue because it was in the 2000s. These receivers are. Bobby Wagner gets involved, and there's that offensive line again, just pushing people around. as I say that, there you go of course, there you go Reed is right there to stop him in the backfield Pollard, losing 4, 2nd down and 14 they slant angle and move quite a bit he's shaded to the left and he comes back the other way and completely surprises Tyler Biotich, another Badger, he's lined up there and there's the quickness these defensive linemen, 306 pounds and moves like that. Smith checking the big board. Second down and 14. 2-1 time of possession advantage for Dallas over the middle. That's caught here. Dowdham. Some shifty moves but then it all collapses on him inside the 30 yard line at the 27. Kaylee. Guys, Jordan Brooks is on the sideline right now without his helmet. He was taken into the blue medical tent for an examination and now it appears like his left thigh groin area is wrapped up we have not gotten any injury designation from the team yet though thank you Kaylee so yeah that's my Frank Clark Devin Bush out there as well yeah third down and seven Prescott Dancing Throwing Caught 10 yard line Brandon Cooks Brandon Cooks Played with Houston last year Traded for him He's been around 5 teams In his career In 10 years in the National Football League And that's going to take us To the 2 minute warning 2 minutes to go in the opening half in Arlington, Texas on this Thursday night, the final night of the month of November, 17-4 from the 10-yard line. 13th play of this drive. Prescott keeps. Gets to the 5. Tackled there by Wulin. Second down and goal. Pete Carroll runs down to call a timeout here. It's his second. Wow. Dak Prescott tonight, I think what we've seen is a continuation of what we've seen over the last four or five weeks as far as the trust and confidence that he has in the people around him. And, of course, the offensive line giving him time. You can see it a lot of times on third down, have to work through his progressions from the left back to the right. He's able to hit CeeDee Lamb, who got inside leverage there. And, again, look how confident he is in his system. He talks a lot about he and Mike McCarthy working together throughout the week. Brian Schottenheimer on that same page, and by the time he gets out here for the game, he's as comfortable as he's ever been. I think we've seen that in this first half. 75% completion percentage, and he almost gets sacked, and then the flag is thrown, and he does get sacked, and we'll see about the penalty. That's going to be holding on the left guard, Smith. Right, that's Leonard Williams who comes in there, picked him up earlier in the season in a trade with the New York Giants. Offense, number 73. Ten-yard penalty. Replay second down. Indeed, that's on Tyler Smith. So they're going to replay second down, second and goal. Draymond Jones moving from the inside out to the outside. He'll come from your far right on a little twist. And there's where Smith has to grab onto him to try to keep him away from his quarterback. Nice call there by Clint Hurt, the defensive coordinator. Correction, Seattle has elected to decline that penalty. Yeah, I was just going to say. Take a little overplay, which is third down and a 10-yard line. Right, I mean, at this point, right. You don't want to give him an extra play at this point. Yes, they decline the penalty. And it's going to make it third down, third and goal now. But tonight, Seahawks can't get off the field on third down. Dallas 7 out of 9 in conversions. Dallas takes its first time out of the half. This will be a 30-second timeout. 30-second timeout. Interesting game on so many levels here. We talked about both teams, obviously, before him. The other thing I'm thinking about, you know, trap game is an overused phrase. But when you look at Dallas' schedule, the way they're playing, and the way Seattle's playing, you know, this could be a semi-trap game. Yeah, I think so. But I do think Dallas is executing pretty well. I think they've just run into a different Seattle team. I think Pete Carroll got his team. Let's face it, Thanksgiving, national TV, they got embarrassed by the 49ers. Niners played great. And I think he's got an angry team that's trying to make amends for not just last week, the last three of the last four weeks. But I'll tell you what, good plan against this explosive Dallas offense. Playing a lot of zone, trying to keep everything in front of him, make Dak Prescott be patient with the pass game, and then see if you can hold him out in the red zone and force field goals. 2010 season, Super Bowl played here, Green Bay against Pittsburgh, and he walked away with a ring. You called that one? No. I didn't call that one. Okay. But we enjoyed it. No, Joe Buck. I think Joe Buck and Troy Aikman called that one. They crushed it, I'm sure. They did, no question. But this offense, again, I think we're going to look at the offensive line here depending on how long they have this football. But like any of these good teams, you've got to be great up front. Caught. Hurdle gets a couple of extra yards a little short of the first time. Jake Ferguson. tight over at the front of a quandary digs and there's frank clark letting him know he wasn't impressed by that still going to be a third down but it's the tight end guys i mean it's a tight end i don't care that's an athlete big fella i'll tell you he's been instrumental in these last few weeks of getting down the middle of the field that's frank clark letting him know that don't impress me much remember that song you think you're brad pitt that don't impress me All right, for the 34-yard line. Tony Pollard picks up the first down. Tyler Smith is a big part of what this line is about. They work so many of these double-team blocks. This time he's worth the oddish. He's right here. He'll work and help, and then he gets off of that double-team. And by getting off of that double-team up to Bobby Wagner right there, he puts him on his back, and it gives him enough room there to pick up that first down. the communication, the timing, the rhythm of those double teams just gets better with this group. Over the middle, middle screen, Ferguson again. Up to the 48-yard line. Of course, for so many years, it was Jason Witten. They've always been a tight end oriented team and they have found another new one here. Yeah, Jane Novacek, go back to Billy Joe Dupree. I mean, they've had it tied in forever here. And, you know, Jake Ferguson's a tough kid out of Wisconsin. His grandfather's Barry Alvarez, who's a tough head coach. You can just imagine what he brings as far as just the attitude to this team. Prescott solidly in the pocket, caught over the middle. G.D. Lamb having a great half, picks up about nine on the plate. Devin Bush makes the tackle, and Lamb has now caught six for 74 yards in the touchdown. And that's just a little thing, but creating space for a great receiver against a linebacker. Look at all of the room. You're going to work outside. He gives him a little move to the outside. And then back inside, Dak knows he's going to get there. That's a first and ten easy play call with Mike McCarthy and Shottie there opening up the middle. On a second and one. And fighting his leg close to the first down. Enrico Dowdle comes up a little bit short the way it looks. Leifman looks over to the sticks. Bobby Wagner, you know, some of the years in Seattle, last year in L.A., now he's back and he's playing great. You and I talked to him on the field last year when he was with L.A., and, you know, he was happy to be there, but obviously he looks great in this uniform. And there's just something about seeing Bobby Wagner in a Seattle uniform. Takes us back to the Sherm days and those great defenses. But I'll tell you, I think he's as good as he's ever been right now. and Prescott will take it himself for a first down. I thought it was interesting, Pete Carroll saying, you know, leaving us and coming back, you know, he's always been a great player, but he's even more on point now because I think he has even a better appreciation for the way we do things and losing that for a year and coming back because he's a Seahawk, you know, this is his home. 12th year in the league, and he still leads the team in tackles among the league leaders with 113, two and a half sacks, eight times to the Pro Bowl. He's been great for Jordan Brooks and the other linebackers. Lamb inside the 35-yard line. Yeah, you imagine how fired up Jamal Adams is. Sure. Went to LSU, grew up in this area, went to high school here, Played high school football games on his field. So you know he's wound up and trying to make a difference tonight. The older he gets, the more and more he becomes almost like a linebacker. It's that slot position he's in. Blitz him a bunch. Always up there in run support. Perennially fired up is Jamal Adams. Second and three. Through the middle. That'll be a first down. Pound over right guard. Adams makes that tackle. Four minutes to go in the first half. I love that CeeDee Lamb, you know, he gets involved. This time he doesn't sustain his block up to the top against Adams, who we were just talking about. But he's a willing blocker. This will be their 44th play of the game. Seattle's run only 18. Prescott. He can run, but he can't get to the end zone. He's going to be stopped at the three-yard line. That's Bobby Wagner saving the touchdown. Now he's a fourth and goal. So 1.38, that stops the clock on the timeout. He splits 1 minute 40 seconds on the game clock, 1.40. Pete getting escorted back to where the officials think he belongs. That's the aspect of Dak Prescott's game that is still there. You know, in his eighth year, you get everybody covered. You better still account for Dak Prescott pulling it down and taking it off. He almost made him pay for it. Bobby Wagner ends up making a good play to keep him out of the end zone. All right, so you have a sure three, but they'll sue that at least for the moment. Line up to go for it. Fourth down and goal. Sixteenth play of this drive. Starting to back in their own 25. They're going. Prescott looking, rolling, flag. And for the moment, he will get into the end zone pending the call. But here's Blakeman to tell us, holding on Dallas. Right tackle Terrence Steele, and now McCarthy says, let's bring in the three-point gang. Well, Steele is the one spot on this offensive line where he lunges a bit, times gets himself out of position, 78. And this time he just grabs on to Leonard Williams. It wouldn't have mattered with the penalty, but if he would have gotten this ball out early, he looked here. I thought he might go to this matchup. You see that little hesitation by CeeDee Lamb? By the time he started to go to the corner, he came off of him, but he had him beat. So a 31-yard attempt for Brandon Aubrey, who is 23 of 23. in his rookie season. And the one-time soccer player at Notre Dame didn't play football there. Will make it just inside the right upright. And a flag comes in after the play. It was getting chippy on that last play, and then the flag comes in after the kick was signaled good. If you know Smith ready to come back out, they've got a minute and 30. Right there. So Aubrey, for the moment, 20-14. Cameron Young was involved in some action here. At the end, yeah, there he is. Throwing Brock Hoffman, the snapper on the field goal. The field goal is good. And after the play, we have a personal foul, defense number 93. And that 15-yard penalty will be assessed on the kickoff. Time out. All right. 90 seconds remaining in the half. It's a six-point game at 18. It will be at 8.15 Eastern time in the Steel City Patriots-Steelers on Thursday night. So a minute and 30. great disparity there in time of possession this quarter in the plays but it's a six point game and the Seahawks will get the ball and we go to Kaylee this week DK Metcalf said that he put his focus on doing his job because he realized as the Seahawks offense was struggling he was caught up trying to do too much well if you look at him after he scored that first touchdown he's saying in sign language standing on business that slang for taking care of your responsibilities, which was exactly what he was focused on this week. He's actually been challenging himself to learn sign language. He took a course in college, and now he's seven classes into a new program. He says it's a way to get his mind off of football. It also comes in handy on the field. Yeah, that's good to know, Kay. Maybe it's the Sensors are having a hell of a time trying to figure that out. From the 25-yard line on first down, that pass is overthrown. Yeah, and Parsons, who else, coming in and knocking Smith down at the end of the play. And how about this? You've got a 41-year-old right tackle who's seen it all, and he's thinking, man, I've got to be out here on an island against Parsons in a two-minute offense. Tight end chips. It still doesn't slow him down. Pete Carroll's smart to use those timeouts. Remember, Seattle gets the ball to start the second half, but they've got a chance here. They're looking for the two for one, and this is Charbonnet taking it. In the east, you've got Philly at 10-1, Cowboys 8-3. Those two meet a week from Sunday night here. Meanwhile, the Cowboys won the toss. They've elected to receive, and why not? In recent years, most teams defer, but more and more teams are receiving. And when you're on offense the way these guys have been on offense, Kirk, in the last few weeks, you want the ball. Yeah, your quarterback right now, you see what he's done at home games, 5-0 record. They've outscored opponents at home 205-60. That's the largest point differential through the first five games of any team in the last 57 years in a league, and this guy is on fire. And this team has never trailed once in any home game thus far this season. Pollard is the running back. He gets it. Picks up a couple. Takes it out to the 27-yard line to make it second down and eight. So Prescott, fourth-round pick eight years ago. Talking about how hot he has been. He only had six touchdown passes in the first six games 17 over the last five games He throwing a lot of short passes early and now really airing it out And he's going to air it out here and connect to the 50-yard line to C.D. Lamb having a sensational season, averaging seven catches per game. Gain of 24. And he's matched up with the rookie right here, Devin Witherspoon, who's had such a great season. Look how he goes outside leverage. It eases it for CeeDee Lamb to work back to the inside and give Dak Prescott a lot of credit. That middle safety right there digs. He moves him with his eyes to give him even more room to work with. Lamb 79 reception is now on the season. And that is caught by Lamb again. So make it 80, picking up about 7 on that one. Second down. I've watched Dak Prescott since his days at Mississippi State, obviously throughout his early part of his career, now in his eighth year. I don't know if I've ever seen a bigger smile than a guy that right now has felt any better in his NFL career than the way number four is playing right now. He and Mike McCarthy seeing things the very same way, communicating all week, and really together on how they want to attack opponents. Second down and two. Escaping a tackle in the backfield, getting back to the line of scrimmage. Goes Tony Pollard, of course, with Pollard. Mike McCarthy, there he is. And remember, he inherited Kellen Moore from the previous staff when he took over. So Moore was here for three years now with the Chargers out in Los Angeles, and Mike loves to call plays. Yeah, he loves just being in that quarterback room during the week and going through things with the guys. And I think taking three years off as a play caller took a little bit of time to get that rhythm back. Third and two, fake to Pollard. Dak has time in the pocket. Wide open, 23-yard line, making the catch there. Brandon Cooks. And Cooks has really come on a slow start in his first year as a Cowboy, but red hot of late. Jamal Adams makes the tackle, gain a 19 first down. And Lamb gets a lot of attention, but here's, again, pre-snap movement to create some matchup opportunities and create a little confusion on the back end. Look at that bust right there. It's a good job of moving Cooks. Lamb gets a lot of the attention, But right now, these last three or four weeks, Brandon Cooks is really coming along. From the 23. Give it to Lamb. On the end of the round, breaks the tackle. Picks up four or five or so. Run under bounds there by Quandre Diggs. Let's call it six second and four. It's so easy to get caught up in all this skill that Dak Prescott is working with. But we'd be remiss if we didn't recognize what this offensive line has done. And they're a healthy group, number one. You don't see that very often at this point in the season. Been able to build some continuity all year long. And it just seems like the rhythm gets better every week. Second and four. Set up a little screen here. Breaking a tackle. Picking up a first down. Pollard stopped there by Draymond Jones. So this drive now, seven plays, 64 yards. So you heard all week about Dak Prescott and Mike McCarthy and C.D. Lamb and Brandon Cooks and Jake Ferguson, and now you're seeing it. Mike McCarthy has put together a great script here, different formations, personnel groupings. In Seattle, I think right now their heads are spinning, trying to stay up with what Dallas is doing with their foot on the gas. First time he's gone with three tight ends on a slant. Lamb can't hold it. And good coverage there by Wheat Wulin, making it second down and ten. He's got that long arm with his left hand to be able to get in there and knock that football away. This has been a, much like we've seen these last five weeks, very aggressive Dallas approach here this first drive. Field goal unit comes in to try to tie the game. You know he's lined up outside. He's going to probably go around you or work back inside. He works back inside, but watch the guard not realize until too late. If you're going to help out, you've got to commit outside quicker because 11-1-on-1 against Cross is a mismatch, and he made them pay for it there. That's Smith's first miss, the incomplete pass. He's five out of six. Myers comes in now to attempt a field goal. 37-yard attempt and a whistle. Play clock ran out. Offense, five-yard penalty. So Pete Was he trying to call the timeout? No, I think he's Let's see Timeout, yeah You can read that He's trying to call it Now it's a 42-yard attempt He doesn't get the timeout Myers five yards back With a minute to go And might have mattered Wide right. Slicing. Out of bounds. With 58 seconds left in the quarter. World-renowned. From the 32-yard line. Prescott throws over the middle. That's caught, and that'll be a first down. As Luke Schoonmaker, number two tight end, makes the grab. Gain a 12 here. Final minute of the first quarter. You know, with Dalton Schultz moving on to the Texans, Jake Ferguson and Schoonmaker now take over. When they go into that 12 personnel look with one back and two tight ends, Ferguson has had a great year, and Schoonmaker is a very nice compliment to him. Fake, and then the pass is incomplete. Taking a shot at the end of the play was Turpin. Adam Sterling on the play. You know, it's so interesting. I was listening to Aaron Rodgers on the Mac of his show. You're talking about the cadence. Of course, we've come a long way since Hut 1, Hut 2. Yeah. And you were a quarterback. Yeah. And then we had Omaha, and then we had all this. And Aaron. Now you hear, here we go. Green 19. And now, yeah. Here we go. Here we go. It means I've got the look I want. We're ready to go. Yeah, here we go. Wait, did you? 10. Pass is caught on the far side. Hold in and then thrown down. And the crowd wants a flag right in front of the Cowboy bench. C.D. Lamb making the catch. There is no flag. And that will take us to the end of the first quarter. End of the first 15 minutes of play in Arlington, Texas. 10-7. Coach, you called this game an enormous opportunity for your team. How do you feel they're responding to that sense of urgency? I wish you made the kick right now. You know, we had a couple calls out here that disturbed me a little bit, but we missed the kick. We need to keep it tied up. What improvements do you want to see in your defense in the second quarter? Well, the big penalty was a big deal. Changed the whole field position. We've got to stay on top on that touchdown pass, too. Thanks, Coach. All right, a little bit more on that right after this play. It's third down and four from the 49-yard line. Prescott's going to keep it himself, and he's going to come up about a yard shot. So, Kirk, just finish the point there. Pete talked about missing the kick. He also talked about a couple of calls. Yeah, I think he was frustrated really on that field goal attempt where the play clock was working down. The ball wasn't spotted until there was about 15 seconds to go on the play clock. Normally under 20, you're going to see a reset. So I think that's why they ended up getting the delay of the game and ended up costing them three points and a chance to tie this game. Meanwhile, no huddle. But they're taking their time now on a fourth and one. From the 47. And here they go, and here they go for a first down and a lot more. Pollard. Knocking somebody over on the Seattle sideline. Converting on fourth down, taking it to the 36-yard line. But when you play man-to-man and Gallup works to the inside to help make a seal block, your corner, who's got the edge, he's going to follow it. So there's no one there. So good call on man coverage on fourth and short, and instead of working it to the middle the way the old Cowboys would with Zeke Elliott, now you work more on the perimeter and on the edge with Pollard. Play action, nice block there, and then a little toss there to Pollard, who made the block, makes the catch, makes the first down. Jamal Adams came in, Pollard took him out of the play. Dallas is trying to come over, but there's no way a back's going to come over from here, over to the far right. And I think it's because they bring Curse up. It confuses the offensive line. The right tackle, Lucas, doesn't kick out. He comes down on 90, Lawrence. And just a miscue, miscommunication by the offensive line at the worst possible time. So two kneel downs will end this game. So much success on third down tonight for 0 for 3 on fourth down. The Seahawks come in. You've got to give them a ton of credit. resilient team, two straight losses. All they have coming up now is at San Francisco a week from Sunday, and then Philadelphia goes to Seattle. Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys will go to 9-3. They get their first win against a team with a winning record. They face Philadelphia a week from Sunday, then they go to Buffalo and at Miami. You've got to give a lot of credit to the Cowboys' defense. We put up a drive chart of Pete Carroll's group and Geno Smith. What they were able to do is touchdown, miss Fugel, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown. And in the second half, when they needed to step up and make plays, they did. And that's what was able to allow them to win this game. 41-35, back and forth tonight. A lot of terrific performances in this one. Cowboys 14 straight home wins. They own the place. which they didn't for the first eight or nine years in this stadium. They were about 500, but since around 2017, very, very tough at home. Big night for Metcalf. Big night Geno Smith. You've got to feel for him a very resilient guy, 11th year in the league. He's seen it all. The peaks, the valleys, 334 yards. Meanwhile, Prescott is a yard shy of 300, 299, and three touchdowns tonight. Heck of a game. No doubt. No doubt about it. If you and I would have pulled in today. Dabble is the running back. Yard or so. You know, you just heard that report about Jordan Brooks, and what you lose is familiarity with Bobby Wagner. He and Jordan Brooks this year have really gotten better, it seems like, every week with communication. Mentioned earlier how important Bobby Wagner's been to the growth. You know, Brooks replaced Wagner last year in this defense, and now they work together. So keep an eye on Zero in the middle of this defense. It's going to be Devin Bush who stepped in for him. There he is covering the slot receiver there. Catch over the middle. Good grab. First down, Jake Ferguson making the catch. A little slow in getting up. But Ferguson has now caught four for 51 yards. And watch to our right, his left. CeeDee Lamb takes Witherspoon with him and Bobby Wagner with him. So two defenders go downfield. And I'm sure that was a miscommunication, but it frees up Ferguson, who is dangerous after he makes that catch for a tight end. Can he draw him off? Yep, flag. Got a free play here, and it's a pick, but it won't last because Diggs will make the interception for the moment, but that won't count because you've got Le Fay coming across the line. Free play. Five-yard penalty. Offside. Defense number 53. And the neutral goes with a snap. The five-yard penalty. Replace. Second down. First down. First down. First and five. Penalties just keep stacking up here. So now we're getting a lot of points. A lot of penalties on both sides. Really, Dallas 8 for 122 on the game so far. Big Seattle's up to, what, six now? Yep. For 83. So you have 205 yards of penalties tonight. A little oxygen on the sideline there. 37-yard line now. First down and five. Press that flush out. Throws. Well, yeah, what else? It's in a few flags tonight. Lamb ruling there covering on the play. Or interfering. Right. Fire in the pass, holding defense number 27. The five-yard penalty, automatic first down. Cleet Blakeman's going to have to pay after dues when this game is over. Yeah, no doubt. Watch C.D. Lamb sell this. He's going on a go ball, right? Slow, now he's going downfield. Woolen gets fooled, and by the time he comes back, you can see the contact there. Pull it to 32 at the halfway mark of the third quarter. Pollard. Yard or so. Second and eighth. Seattle continue trying to make this Dallas offense have to work to put points on the board. You know, they lead the league in 10-play drives. Tonight they've had three of them in a 14-play drive, an 11-play drive, and another 10. So it's a smart plan to try to make them show that they can make the plays without setting themselves back with penalties. This will be their 50th play of the night. Seahawks have run 36. Second and eight. Prescott fires to the outside and is caught. In forward progress and then a first down for C.D. Lamb who has just come up with his eighth catch of the night. 91 total yards. Wolland covering. Yeah, he did this a little earlier when he got the interference call. He's going downfield again. And then works back. This time Wolland doesn't get his handsy. Ball got away from him a little bit, but it looks like he was able to secure it. Here we go. Prescott. Slides to his left. Coverage is there. Throws it away. That's when Darryl Taylor came in to pop him. Second and ten. Into the red zone. Again, this is their plan to try to force field a fourth time. This will be the fifth time they're going to get into the red zone. They've only scored two touchdowns down here. taking away that run game, forcing Dak Prescott to have to make quick decisions. They started the game first and goal to two, marched down the field. That setback on a sack. Going to be in shock. Keep it on the ground. Next to nothing. So the ball, the five-yard line, third down and goal for the Seahawks. and the Seahawks coming in. Started out very well with you, Dan Quinn. Of course, was a defensive coordinator in Seattle in the Super Bowl years. Went to Atlanta as the head coach. They got Shane Waldron, who's been on this and fired as any offensive coordinator would be when you don't score very much for a few weeks. We're calling a good game tonight. Third down and goal. But with that three-wide receiver look, it moved Jackson Smith and Jigas and all three on the left. Smith going to take it in by himself. Touchdown. Five yards for the score. It's a late flag in the end zone now. Yep. What a job by Geno Smith. I think this touchdown is going to stand. The flag came in after he had gotten in. and the call will be holding defense number 14 that's on Bell so that's the ultimate two for one they take the ball 90 seconds to go no timeouts at the end of the half and score just about at the gun and then takes them five minutes and in they go to extend their lead our man coverage nobody thinking that Geno Smith is a potential threat. Nobody there to account for him. Everybody with their backs turned in man coverage. And Geno Smith sees it and takes off for the touchdown. His first rushing touchdown of the year. The extra point is good off the foot of Jason Myers. So five minutes into the third quarter, the Seattle Seahawks on top 28. I mentioned before, had not trailed at all at home in any game this season until tonight. and out they come to the 25-yard line. So one of the things about the Cowboys, you know, everybody's always looking for warts, is that they hadn't beaten a team with a winning record this season. Trying to do that tonight. There's Jerry Jones, of course, who has owned this team since 1989. Opened this stadium in 2009. It's been a tremendous home field advantage in recent years. And tonight, trying to come from behind. Prescott escapes, fires, and that's incomplete. But what else is new? Laundry all over the place tonight. It's against Seattle. Trey Brown covering that time. Prior to the pass, holding defense number 22. The five-yard penalty, automatic first down. Well, Trey Brown, any time a quarterback starts to move, you try to plaster, stay in with the receiver. It's a tough thing to do. When the quarterback starts to move, you've got to be so disciplined. Start to peek back. You look back into that backfield, and when you do, your hands get grabby and get a hold of that jersey. You know, seen that a million times. First down. Six-yard gain for Pollard. We go to Kaylee. Guys, just before this drive began, Pete Carroll came over to the Seahawks bench, and he hugged Jordan Brooks. His linebacker is sitting over here with ice wrapped around his left ankle. He had an x-ray during halftime. I'm now told he's doubtful to return. He's such an important vocal leader for these guys. But before this drive, it was Jamal Adams who had his fist in the air telling this team, it's our time. Yeah, he had the only touchdown against San Francisco on Thanksgiving on a return at second and four. And close to a first down. Does he have it? Tony Pollard. You know, we were talking about Pete Carroll. I've told this story before. Brian Cushing was the linebacker for the Texans for many years. And meanwhile, you've got Jamal Adams, who will need a little bit of attention. So Adams is down on the turf after that first down. Talking about Brian Cushing when he was with the Texans. And he was a Jersey kid, and his parents wanted him to stay close to home. And he's watching a college football game, and that's he's playing. And he says, who is that coach? Who's that guy running up and down the sidelines? That's the guy I want to play for. And that's how Cushing wound up at USC. A lot of people in that era would see him chewing his gum and wearing his Ray-Bans. And he just looked like a nice guy and a guy you want to play for. And he was able to recruit some of the top athletes around not just Southern California, but around the country. He was the it school in his glory years at SC. What a national championship and a Super Bowl. Trying to make it a three-point lead. Two-point try here. 4.37 left in the fourth. Lamb in motion. Prescott looks the other way. Then over the middle. Caught. Two-pointer. Brandon Cooks. 4.37 left in regulation. Dallas 38, Seattle 35. Or you know, or anybody knows. Yeah, I think they get great use out of it, too. Tremendous. High school games, a lot of events. Yep. And it's beautiful. And the Seahawks start at their own 25. They used one timeout, so two remaining as we come down the stretch here. Keep in mind, Geno Smith is a guy that is used to being in these situations. He has six game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or in overtime over the last couple years. So this is a chance for number seven. So you've got a quarterback that if he has time to throw, he's got the weapons and he's got the experience to make it happen. That calf left. Lock it. Smith and Jigman to the right. Smith fires. Up to the 40-yard line. The rookie makes the grab again. Smith and Jig were having his best night of his very brief young career with a lot more to come. Watch him sell this route, and Bland has gotten so much attention for his ability to keep his eyes and make plays. He turns him. Once he turns him, it's over. Great job of recognizing that matchup and getting the ball to the rookie for a big first down to start his drive. Seven catches, and, of course, it was the pass interference at the end of the half that set up. Go ahead, touchdown. Now you've got D.J. Dallas, the backup back, up to the 49. Last time we left Charbonnet, he was in the blue tent. Tell you what, C.D. Lamb looking on, trying to pull this defense through. But I'm going to tell you, one of the stories for me tonight, no matter what happens, is a Seattle offensive line that has not played well in the last three or four weeks has helped Geno Smith against a ferocious Dallas defense and given him in this running game just enough. They sent Charbonnet for just learning to the locker room. That means DJ Dallas, special teams guy. Doesn't see much action offensively. We'll see a lot right now, including that pants to him, which is low and incomplete. So third and four. they've been going to Jackson Smith and Jig but quite a bit here if he depending on the matchup and the coverage that he gets so Brian Schottenheimer go over things with Prescott on the sideline ball at the 49 yard line crowd pretty much rising is one Smith to the left side that's incomplete no flag coverage is good Jordan Lewis I haven't called his name tonight Jordan Lewis said you know what this kid's getting me enough look where the yellow line is and this is the experience of Lewis he knows this route's going to be very close to that great job of anticipating that quick throw so he's able to hit him right as the football gets to him good job of separating going for another fourth and four from the 49 yard line Dallas moves out now back off his back foot floats one incomplete didn't matter whether Blandon or Sipton 9 in fact it was better off if he didn't they saved the yardage turn it over and you know Dallas is going to dial up the pressure Geno Smith knew it and that's why even though you don't get a sack. Watch what Geno Smith has to do and the reason Jackson Smith and Jigman doesn't see it. He's got to get rid of the football. DJ Dallas steps up to be able to pick up the blitz in the middle from Clark but Levin never locates the ball because Geno Smith has to throw it now and by the time he turns and looks the ball's already in the air because of that pressure from Dallas. You had Lawrence you had Dante Fowler in there. So Dallas the Cowboys take over the 49 Al Harris don't over things with bland Start using the clock we'll see they will Look at this to the scrum Prescott Stepping up flips it Pollard Can't get away. With a spoon in and the tackle setting up third and long. You know, that's as much about coverage as it is about the pressure. Dak is a guy that's going to wait in that pocket and try to find that open receiver. But you've got seven guys back there in zone reading the eyes of Dak Prescott. And then finally nobody there, so he's got to check it down. defense from Seattle very well prepared against this explosive offense 5 wide 3rd and 12 3 man rush 8 back, fired to the end zone broken up Lamb of course is there, he threw a crowd 4th down, in comes the field goal to units that's one of the first times we've seen Dak Prescott try to force one into his guy regardless of the coverage. You know, he's been patient all night, but you look, this is what Dak's looking at. That is a tough throw to make between a lot of blue jerseys to try to squeeze that into CeeDee Lamb. Witherspoon digs right there. Here comes the man who has not missed a field goal attempt all year, 38 yards for Brandon. Albee, the former soccer player, grew up in this area. No kibosh for me. Close. He tried. But no, come on. Pick is good. Seattle's lead is now 5. 35-30. It was a great idea. It was a great start a few years ago. And the players are totally born into it. I love the reaction from the players when they see it for the first time. Yeah. They have an idea, but then to see it, they get fired up. Open up that box. Take a look at what the makers have done. 35-30. Let's take a peek at the 4K Sky Camp. It's presented by J.C. Penney, and we're going to focus on Micah Parsons, who's been a factor, not necessarily if you look at his stats, but sometimes it's not about that with him. It's the amount of tension that he draws and opens up other opportunities and how he forces tonight Geno Smith to get that ball out of his hands maybe before he's ready to do that. So 11, not only a big night so far, but if they're going to come back and win this game, Parsons is going to have to make it. Let's see the 75 pressures. It's another look at Howard by AWS. From the 25, start this drive. Little toss back here. Charbonnet. Nice night now, as it turns out, with Kenneth Walker still hurt, missing his second game. You've got 14 combined drives in the game tonight. This is 15. No punts. None. Not one. I think there's only been four games in the history of the NFL where there's been no punts. another record we should keep in mind here the record for penalty orange in the game 374 don't touch that down 1951 tonight we're with 252 stay tuned second and six and Geno Smith is going to look to the Sideline, trying to take a timeout. Play clock had expired. Seattle takes its first timeout of the half. They get it. We're back in 32nd timeout. Back in 32nd. And it's second down and six now. From the 28-yard line. Pass caught. Close to a first down, Smith and Jigba. Line judge comes right in there. Let's see where they spot it. Isn't she shy or a first down? Yep. Maybe even less than a half a yard. But, again, there's an idea. He's so explosive with the ball in his hands after the catch. And, again, 200 pounds, so tough to bring down. Now Keese Bell stopped him. Smith is going to take it over the left side. Needed a few inches. Got him. First down. Ten minutes to play in regulation. Forget to push to a she goes wide. He went way around that left side. They're going to. I think they are going to move him. but I thought they might come out and measure. Put it right on the 35-yard line. Watch how far he goes out. Just trying to get away from that defense, pinching down to take away the threat of him getting right behind the center and guard. So he goes wide around the left tackle, actually all the way around DK Metcalf. Didn't need to measure because when it starts at the 25 and you put it right on the 35, it's a first down. Trying to reverse directions. Nothing you know about a four or five yard game. That's Dallas' version of the push-tush there to be able to get some positive yards. So 36-0 are the Seahawks when scoring 35 or more points. Well, you score 35 or more, you almost always win the game. Yeah. But tonight, in jeopardy. Yeah, they get the three timeouts, the two-minute warning. It's all about the clock right now with Dak Prescott. And stopping them. Second and six. Prescott using all the play clock. Handed this time to land. First down. A lot more. Tackles from behind to save a touchdown. Takes it to the 20. Heck of a block by Tolbert, who's out in front of that jet sweep. Watch 18 right here be able to secure that block on the rookie, Witherspoon, that gives him a chance to get underneath of that. How dangerous is he in open field? I mean, people see what he can do downfield, but it's just as dangerous with the ball in his hands making people miss. Two-minute warning at AT&T. Cowboys up by three. Recap it all. First down now at the two-minute mark to the 17. Tony Pollard taken down there and timeout immediately called by Seattle, their second. This second half has had a lot of big plays but none bigger for Dallas in the way the defense has stepped up. First it was big to Marcus Lawrence on that fourth down in one play and then this last time that Geno Smith had the ball because of that pressure. He just had to throw it and hope that Jackson Smith and Jigga would look up and locate it but because he had to get rid of it early, the Dallas defense does their job. Meanwhile, Gino Smith, that elbow, which suffered blunt force trauma from Aaron Donald a couple weeks ago. Kind of fought through it last week. Fought through it. That Rams game came back in at the end. Second and six. Work on that. Seattle with one timeout. Keep it on the ground. Pollard, they'll take the timeout here. They took only three seconds, so now Seattle on the timeouts, third down. Once again, the standings as they stand right now. So in the West, San Fran 8-3, Seattle would drop to 6-6 if they don't come from behind. Rams are 5-6. Rams have Cleveland this weekend, have already beaten Seattle twice, so they would own that tiebreak for the moment. Meanwhile, Philly is 10-1, and Dallas will go to 9-3 to stay a game and a half back. How about the Eagles and the Niners? Eagles 10-1, Niners 8-3. If the Niners are somehow able to win that game, you're looking at 10-2 Philly and 9-3 Dallas if the Cowboys win out tonight. What a matchup that would be the next week with Philadelphia and Dallas here in Arlington. Brian Angers had the night off, so has Michael Dixon. No punch in the game, third down and three. First down would wrap it up here. And Prescott will look to end it in effect here. You've got all kinds of contact going on. Yep, you've got Trey Brown is right there. You've got C.D. Lamb, the intended receiver. Fourth down. And good position by Trey Brown, thinking that this ball made. See how he's just bailing already? He doesn't go for that quick slant there. He just gets his body in position there. I'll tell you why it's huge. It's because that's an incompletion, and the clock stops, obviously. And now we've got a fourth down play with the offense still out there. Meanwhile, you've had only 14 seconds since the two-minute warning. And let's see if they do indeed go for it, just trying to draw them off. So that will take us to a likely field goal attempt. First time out. This will be a 32nd time out. We were at the break there, and we were saying, you know, that big play that Dallas had that got them way down into Seattle territory It was like you know what that probably worked out for the best for Seattle Now they can try to get it stopped use their timeouts As it turned out And get the field goal You down six Now you give the ball to Geno Smith About a minute 35 to go. Well, meanwhile, you know, they went at the end of the first half down the field in 90 seconds without a timeout. So they've been here before. Meanwhile, here is Aubrey, Brandon Aubrey, kid who grew up locally, played soccer at Notre Dame. Played in the USFL with the Birmingham Stallions. Brought him into camp. 28-year-old rookie. Hasn't been made, but the coverage is right there. As Lamb makes the catch. Tackled immediately by Wulin. To Kaylee we go. And guys, Al Harris, that former DB himself, telling that group, there's one more out there. One more out there for you to go get. Meanwhile, that's Witherspoon. Devin Witherspoon, who needed the attention for the moment. There is Al Harris. He's a back coach. He knew a little bit about interceptions. Yeah, and you know what? Along his journey, he was on a practice squad a couple years in his career before he became a starter in a very, very good corner in this league at Philly and in Green Bay. And so I think he really is able to relate to guys, no matter what they're going through. And he's been very instrumental and bland in the year that he has had. and really the last year that he had as a rookie with the five interceptions and now eight this year. Harris had 21 picks in his career. Played for Mike McCarthy in Green Bay. Third and five. Prescott fires. Caught 30-yard line but stopped in his tracks. Bobby Wagner takes care of Brandon Cooks there, setting up a fourth down and two. He's not hesitating. He's already talking to Dak Prescott, fourth down and two. I think he senses this opportunity. They started this drive after the interception and plus territory inside the 40-yard line. It's a ball at the 30. Passing up what will be a lead-changing 48-yard field goal. Dowd is the running back. Ferguson is the motion man. Prescott rolling throwing and along the sideline no incomplete right in front of the Seattle bench Lamb can't hold it says it's my fault a minute and four to go in the third and the Seahawks take over up by a point for his coaching career but especially with both of his sons on the team, he told me. He is loving every minute of this. Jerry Jones looks on. Love covering Witten all those years. Meanwhile, that pass reaching for it. Pete Carroll puts his hands up. Yes. Caught. Noah Fant. Covered by first for a gain of 25 yards. First and 10. 13 personnel. One back. Three tight ends. Play action. Watch him turn his body. What a job by Fant. Shows the athletic ability. There's the three tight ends. You're thinking they're going to run it. The defensive personnel, good job of pulling away from Kirst to safety. And again, turning his body so the ball didn't hit the turf. Great play there. One of the guys that came over in the trade that sent Russell Wilson to Denver. Then it comes to Seattle. Meanwhile, they give it to Dallas. He's looking to throw. Nothing there. He'll run. Gets hogtied. About the line of scrimmage. And then a late flag comes flying in. Jonathan Hankins was there Had him lassoed McCarthy says he got him by the shoulder pad I think he thought he got him underneath that Face mask Good decision, by the way, not to throw that football We got a five-man conference going on right now Tires zebra conviction I had a feeling All right. Well, not only have we had 17 penalties, we've had three other flags resulting in they pick the flag up. All right. What can I tell you? It's been one of those nights. Meanwhile, I don't think I see another quarter. Or not. We'll see. Yep. One more play. It'll flip out here. Charbonnet tons of room and the quarter will end with Charbonnet setting up a first down and goal from the five-yard line Armstrong saves the touchdown for the moment and we go to the fourth and a wild one in Oregon for a 40-yard gain 28 27 Seahawks on Thursday night football Four guys in the backfield handle all the Chardonnay two to three. Go back to that big play, that last play of the half. Look at Dallas confused. You see a lot of confusion in the middle with the linebackers. Bell, also Clark. They're trying to get on the same page. Keep your eye on 14 to the right with him out of position. So Charbonnet tonight, we talked about Kenneth Walker as their main back. Charbonnet's been the backup, but he has now carried 18 times, 59 yards, but one pass for 39. The second down from the 37-yard line. There's Kenneth Walker. The good news for him is they've got the mini bye after a Thursday and don't play for 10 days. Smith rolling, throwing the voids, the sack. Arm was coming forward. That time, Demarcus Lawrence got in there. They think the ball is still alive. Three-flagman says, no, sir, come back. They've been running these counters and then boots off of them quite a bit. This time it's off a stretch play. And Dallas' defensive line, who did he do at that time, took away the potential receiver that he wanted to throw this football to. Ball hand is coming forward for sure, so that's an incompletion. So it does set up a big third down here. Cowles throwing third and seven, 849. D.J. Dallas is in the backfield with lines up between the center and the guard. Flare him out. Pass caught. Smith and Jigba. Does he get the first down? Where's the spot going to be? 45-yard line. It's right there. Kearse and Bell are right there. And the rookie has enough for the first down. Wow. Another third down where they find 11 with space. Again, he's just one of these guys that can do some damage to you. Has a great feel. Just sit in that soft spot. Now turn and get north and south and get physical. You've got to fight for those yards every inch. Got to get to the 45. Just does again. Back-to-back first downs. They just got him. Seattle now 9 for 11 on third down. Smith fires, and that's incomplete. Lockett was there, had it, pounds the turf, couldn't hold it. Second down. You know, Geno Smith has heard a lot about how he's holding on to the ball too much. That he's got to get the ball out of his hands, get back to what he did last year. How about this on first and ten? Ball is out. Well before Lockett, who usually makes that catch almost every time. That ball got on him in a hurry. If he wouldn't have put his hands up, it would have gone right into the face mask. So, great throw. You go right back to Lockett. He's a pro's pro. He just happened to miss that one on first and ten. Geno Smith still throwing fastballs in his 11th season. Backs up here. Look out. Gets rid of the ball. And they're going to call an incomplete pass, as it turns out. When Diggie Zawa got in there, it'll be third down and ten. Boy, he is quick. Again, that's what he's known for at 280 pounds. Watch him work outside and in the bend. Watch the bend there to be able to get him around the tackle there across. Just so sudden and quick with the balance and then the closing speed. Third down ten. Pass caught on the flat. This is a catch by Jake Bobo, his first catch of the night, and that's going to set up a fourth down and one. Bobo, a rookie out of UCLA. Shane Waldron is calling a great game. You knew Dallas was going to dial it up, so you think either a screen or you get the ball out of the perimeter quickly, and they do. It seems to be a different guy every time. We've seen the tight ends involved. We've seen Jackson Smith and Jigla, Tyler Lockett, D.K. Metcalf. And that time it's Bobo that comes up with yards after the catch. And it's fourth and one. Lock running down to the seven-minute mark. Doesn't get it. DeMarcus Lawrence stops Charbonnet in the backfield. Up over the tight end. You're expecting it to be the outside shoulder. Cross lunges out for him, and Lawrence is able to work underneath him and surprise him. Chardonnay never had a chance with that move inside by 90. Veteran savvy. Great move. Meanwhile, from the 46 now, Dallas begins this drive with a pass to the outside. Lamb making the catch. Gain of 9, maybe 10. Witherspoon is right there. Where will they mark it? right at the 45-yard line nope they're gonna mark how to settle for three second down ten Prescott under pressure again that's incomplete and of course you got a flag when you get that kind of contact there that's Bobby Wagner draped on Tony Pollard pass interference defense number 54 ball replaced with a spot of the foul first down Dallas yeah Bobby Wagner's known throughout his career for his coverage skills he does it all but really a great linebacker in coverage he recognizes this ball is coming out boy I that's very close yeah very close that's the third first down by penalty on this drive Terry, stop laughing. I see you. First attempt from the 19. Prescott avoids a sack at first. Then he goes down. Man, pressure. Reed is there again. Big number 90 coming into the middle of the eighth year. Out of Alabama. Picked in the second round back in 16. Yeah, what you love about Jerem Reed is he just doesn't give up on the play. They're going to twist and move. whatever they can do to try to create some matchup advantages. He comes free. Looks like he's cleared, but then that's the effort right there, that relentless style right there from a big defensive tackle. Sometimes you see a guy go down, lose his footing, gives up on the play. Jaron Reed does not, and that ends up allowing him to get that sack. That's the fourth of the night. Dallas, meanwhile, has none against Smith. Second and 13 to the end zone goes Prescott, and that's incomplete. And another flag, of course, because you've got C.D. Lamb. You've got Brown is back there, but he's saying, huh? And Trey Brown, actually, I think this one is going to be a good call. He grabs around his waist. Fire to the pass, illegal contact, defense number 22. Five-yard penalty, automatic first out. This one is certainly a penalty. There have been some in kind of the gray area. He stops there, and then he turns and goes, and there's grabbing on. Pretty obvious. The ball's not in the air yet. It would have been interference instead. It's defensive holding and five yards and another first down. What does that you say? Is that the third or fourth? Yeah, fourth. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We're going to take the rest of the night off. Let's leave Blakeman called the game. You buy him? Sure. He and Terry can get to the bottom of it. Absolutely. Stucked in the backfield. Well, that's Adams coming up from the secondary for a loss of three on Pollard. People love to see that if you're a fan of the Seattle Seahawks team. Jamal Adams, the veteran, sixth year out of LSU, hometown kid, sees it right away. I think he just saw the pull and just tried to get underneath it, which he's able to do and chase it from behind. 20, 20. Yeah, there he goes. Caught. Escaping Ferguson. On a second and 13. First down. Then he gets shoved at the end of the play. Now it gets very chippy. No flags yet. That's two Warriors right there. Jake Ferguson's not going to back down from Jamal Adams. And, you know, like you said, Jamal Adams is fired up all the time, let alone when he's back in his hometown. This is towards the end of the play. He is a load and does not slow down 245 pounds. He and Adams face-to-face. No sign language there. First and goal. Under four to play in the quarter. Prescott fires. Juggled incomplete. Tony Pollard, the intended receiver, Bush was there. Looking for the camera, second down and goal. He's open. Bush is a little bit late. We talked about him being in for Jordan Brooks. He's right here in coverage. Here's your receiver. Again, Pollard brings you that skill set. Running back to, you know, times in college at Memphis, he would line up first two years as a receiver. That just shocking. It went right through his hands, hit him in a face match. Second and goal, 12th play of another long drive. Flip to Pollard. Looking for room. Has it. In there. Touch it. At the 44, and that's a first time. Meanwhile, there is the running back, Charbonnet, going into the blue tent to get checked out. They have to get him stuffed on that fourth down play. Yeah, Seattle going to continue to try to keep the explosive play in front of him, make Dallas go move the ball slowly and then see if they can execute the red zone. It's been the plan all night. Big hole exploited. Pollard running over people inside the 30. First down, 6.5 to go. Biotic to center, right guard, Zach Martin able to get up to the linebacker. This hole just opens up. You see Smith there on that trap. That play just opened up in a hurry. and heck of a job by Pollard hitting that, not hesitating at all, gets upfield quickly to take advantage of that nice blocked track. Prescott. Oh, incomplete to the outside here. Then for Michael Gallup, who's at a silent night. Woolan covering on that play, second down to 10. Woolan almost gets his hands on that football. You're right. We've not called Gallup's name at all tonight. And what a tough matchup. Look at the length. Again, Wollin is 6'4". That's why they put him out on those islands. Eyes on the football. He's able to, again, use that length to make a play on the football. Here we go. Extra man coming. Pass caught. Slanting over the middle is ZD Land. who's been all over the place tonight. And that's 11 catches for C.D. Lamb tonight for 110 yards. Well, he's consistent, isn't he, Al? I mean, every single week, in the last five weeks especially. He's averaging 7.1 catches per game. That'll go up a tick after tonight, third and three. Yeah, people! to the outside. First down. Lamb now with a dozen catches. Little whip route, and he's looking up his main guy. He gets into these critical downs and situations where he knows he needs to make a play. He's going to look to 88. At that time, Lamb kind of works inside, sells that slant where he just had success, and against man coverage, bounces back outside, gets great separation from Ruhlin. Prescott himself close to a first down. Ruhlin makes the tackle, a little join goes on here. Ball spotted at the six-yard line. They're going to spot it a little short. this time you know they ran that trap play and it hit big for Pollard this time he's reading this in man in the line of scrimmage 55 collapses he pulls it and that's that little wrinkle they just run it every once in a while great time to call it there on first and 10 and it gets a little chippy there with Wolin and Dak Prescott giving him a little flex three tight engine in this set Second down. Short two. Play clock at one. Play clock at zero. And the Cowboys will get the timeout. Delay a game. No, they won't. Wow. Number four. The five-yard penalty. Still second down. I was looking at Mike McCarthy. Yeah. And he's getting the timeout, but I think he got it in by the time it was called. It was too late. So that turns a second and a short two into a second and seven. Ball back at the 12. Brandon Cook sets up wide to the right. Lamb comes to the left. Looks toward Lamb. Shoulder shake. Throw! That's going to be caught by Ferguson. Touchdown. Well, these were the two that were going face mask to face mask earlier in the game. I told you Jake Ferguson's not going to back down from Jamal Adams. A little out and then up. Not bad position, but Adams never looks back. Never found the football. So it's tough for him to be able to adjust. I think Dak realized that Adams was lost out there on an island. What a play. I told you the big tight end is athletic. And they'll go for two with a one-point lead. They go 75 yards and a dozen plays. Totally bound. Six runs. Six passes. and those linemen are athletic they're big and they're physical but when they run the ball to the edge and get on the perimeter whether it's the tackles or the center, Biotic they get out there and create a convoy to be able to get behind and gives you a chance to work outside and then get north and south over 18 minutes left of the game so McCarthy down by 2 opts for the extra point here to make it a one-point game. 341 left in the third. Seattle 28, Dallas 27 on Thursday night. Five seconds, but here's the thing. Dallas didn't have a sack tonight. They're getting after him. Seattle came in with a plan to get the ball out. They knew that this was going to be an issue with their offensive line, but up to this point, listen, they got 28 points on the board. They're doing a pretty good job. One more touchdown. On that drive by Dallas, how many drives have you ever seen with nine first downs on a drive? Yeah. Four by penalty. Well, thank you. Four by penalty. Yeah. And look at Seattle's done. We're talking about that pressure. It hasn't affected their rhythm or the results. Touchdown. They drove 52 yards. Nine plays and missed a field goal. Then touchdown, touchdown, touchdown. So whatever they're doing, they want to continue that here the rest of this game. Come up on the pistol this time. Charbonnet. You know, you talk about Seattle, so they draft Russell Wilson. Third round, 2012. He wins the job in the opener. Doesn't miss a start. Now you've got Geno. You realize they've had two, two starting quarterbacks, period, in 12 years. Meanwhile, if Joe Flacco starts for Cleveland, that'll be 21 Cleveland starting quarterbacks in the time that Seattle's at 2. And think about it. I mean, that's an extreme example. But there are a lot of these NFL franchises that you're probably looking at 10 to 15. Sure. A lot. Smith throws into a lot of traffic, and that's incomplete there. Dangerous. Stephon Gilmore actually had position that time on Metcalf, and it'll be third down and seven. That's a different look than what we saw in the first half. 26 was out there quite a bit. Now they go to the veteran Gilmore, who's got a lot of experience, good position with his body. He's more of a technician at this stage of his career as a 33-year-old. Defensive player of the year back in 2019. Played with Indianapolis last season, third and seven. crowd in full voice here Smith to the outside and that is picked off and it's planned so all night long going at him, burning him and now he gets to celebrate well the thing that stands out when you watch him is how he is able to jump the out cut watch his eyes stay on the football remember it's third down he's thinking about the sticks He actually works to the outside with and maybe before Lockett does. High school wide receiver, great instincts, locates the football, steps in front of it, and makes amends for that first half. So for Prescott, a couple of touchdowns, but he's also been sacked a total of four times. Geno Smith ran for that touchdown, two and two passing yards. just through that pick. DK Metcalf. Big night. Five catches for 131 and twice to the end zone. Meanwhile, Bland just came up with his eighth interception of the season. Five have resulted in pick sixes. And he has 13 in his two years in the league. Here we go. Says Prescott and a three-yard gain here by Dowdle. Here we go. All right, well, here we go. Let's go back to show Bland, who's had a rough first half, shows a lot of courage to be able to step up on this out cut. Watch the technique by Bland. It's a clinic tape. He knows it's third down and he's going to go. He already works out, squeezes that cushion, takes it away with his eyes on the quarterback the entire time. Makes it easy to step up. And how fired up is Dan Quinn for his guy after that first half coming up with that pick? Yeah. Watching the guy have a rough first half and then come up with the pick. Already in field goal range here. as he catches. No way he's able to make that play. And then you've got a great hustle downfield by Damian Lewis, the left guard. So everything worked out perfectly. Dallas confused. Bell out of position. And they hit the big play to Charbonnet. Charbonnet 16 carries. 54 yards. Take it to him. Backpedaling. To the end zone. Metcalf. Touchdown. He finds a Seahawks fan, hands him the football, and what a night for Geno Smith and company. Three touchdowns for Geno Smith. Lawrence shaking his head in frustration. There's the lucky recipient. Yep. Seattle extends its lead. Man coverage. Gilmore runs right into curse. Shane Waldron deserves a lot of credit. Great route. kind of rubbed right off of the other receiver coming across. Of course, he's cursed right into Stephon Gilmore. So give Shane Waldron a lot of credit. He knew he'd see a lot of man coverage. He's called up a lot of man beaters. And, man, they have worked for Geno Smith. Extra point by Myers, 35-27 points. Playing the best game of the season. Yeah, they put it all together. And I think they sensed what was ahead of them. They sensed a big challenge tonight against Dallas. And they knew that they had to come out and play differently. And this NFC wild card picture, everybody looking at what Philly and Sam Fran have been able to do. Detroit's been a great story this year. The NFC South, you know, flip a coin by the time that's done. And then there you have the wild card race just wide open. Dallas, of course, in position there at 8-3. There's Seattle, the Vikings, and even others down there still within a game. Week 13, calendar flipping the page to December tomorrow. Cowboys down by eight. First time, as we've mentioned a couple of times tonight. Home game, they've trailed all season long. Nice hole there. Opening for Pollard. It picks up about six. Second down. Second and four. Leonard Williams making the stop there. Field goal, touchdown, touchdown, field goal, touchdown. on the cowboy possession tonight. Then they went for it on fourth down and didn't make the first. Turned it over. Seattle capitalizes. Cowboys down by eight. Prescott deep down the left sideline for Lamb. No flag though. So C.D. Lamb will get the call. Again, you got Rick Wuhlin. All night long, it's been a battle. Pass interference, defense number 27. While he plays to the spot of the foul, first down Dallas. He has C.D. Lamb getting downfield. He gets behind Rulon, who's got great speed, great makeup speed. I mean, he touches the shoulder. I didn't see anything that would potentially keep C.D. Lamb from being able to work back to the football. He touched it. It did not significantly hinder him at all. He put his hand on the shoulder. Well, what can I tell you? 217 yards in penalties tonight. That one, 35 yards. Prescott. Going to go down. Oh, no. Keeps his balance. Throws. Caught along the sideline of all things. Jalen Tolbert is there. Out of the grasp of Darryl Taylor. Had him dead to rights. Ready to go down. Shaking his head. That's just Dak Prescott showing you how physical and athletic he can be. What you love to see is look how quickly he gets his right hand back on the ball. He's ready to throw it. So he gets out of it. Tolbert's open because Witherspoon left him. In man coverage, he leaves him. And he's all alone. Heck of a job. Individual effort there by Dapp. 17-yard line. Prescott to the outside. He goes trying to slip inside his collar to take it out of the grasp of Devin Bush. Second down. What a response here from Dallas. They're down eight. We're into the fourth quarter. A lot of people expected them to be able to take care of business tonight rather handily. and now they're scratching and fighting and drawing up some plays here to create some matchups with a heck of an effort to keep this thing going by Dak Prescott. It's the field goal in his rookie season. 32-yard attempt to try to kick his fourth of the night, which he does. So it's a six-point game. That much time left, as you see, on the graphic. And let's see what Geno Smith, a guy whose elbow was just worked on by the trainers, has in store. I think if you're a Dallas fan, you're wondering, you know, you don't mind trying to take the shot, go for the jugular, the knockout punch to go to CD land. But if you run the football there, I think Seattle's out of timeouts. You work that clock down significantly. Probably, you know, instead of 143, you're looking at maybe a minute, you know, by the time Geno Smith gets the football. So, yeah, a little over, maybe. That's it. Yeah. All right. Before the kick, let's go to Kaylee. Guys, it looks like Geno Smith is going back on the field without the padded sleeve on his throwing arm that he's been wearing these past two games to protect that bruised elbow. You saw him getting that massage. The head athletic trainer was also doing some therapeutic movements with him to help him gain range of motion. Yeah, there he is. There's not a chance. You're taking number seven out of this game in his mind. No matter what that arm feels like, he's fought so hard to put his team where they are right now with 35 points up on the board and a minute 43 away from pay dirt and possibly getting out of here with an upset. Backup quarterback is Drew Locke who came over in the Wilson deal. Meanwhile, you've got a kick here that goes into the end zone. So they have to go 75 yards in 143. I thought you brought up a really good point about, you know, Kenneth Walker not playing tonight. Now Zach Charbonnet is not out there. You're looking at DJ Dallas. They have another rookie in Kenny McIntosh. But it's going to be DJ Dallas who is out there the fourth year running back. Out of Miami. Yeah, mainly special teams. We've got Kenny McIntosh, a rookie from Georgia, but we haven't seen him. He's active tonight. Meanwhile, first down from the 25. Smith retreating. Smith fires. Right side. Caught. Out of bounds at the 43-yard line. Tyler Lockett makes that catch. 138 to go. Yeah, Bland out on an island again. This time it's against Lockett, who is known for his ability to run good, clean routes. sells this to our right, to the inside, and then back outside. And look how quickly he's able to pull away from Bland in a good job by throwing that football on time by Geno Smith. Smith and Jigba. Lockett going through the left side. Metcalf comes to the right side. Gilmore's on him. Smith hangs in the pocket. Fires underneath. Caught. That's Noah Fant, the tight end. Made a great catch before. Takes it to the 50-yard line. Bell makes the stop there. Clock ticking down 125 and running. This offensive line doing just enough to give Geno Smith his time he needs to throw. Second and two. Here comes Parsons. Gets the pass away. It's incomplete. So 113 now. Again, intended for Noah Fant. Third down and two. At that time, Abe Lucas, the right tackle, matched up one-on-one against Micah Parsons. He did everything in his power. Watch him, 72. I mean, he's using his hands, he's using his backside, whatever it takes. Keep 11 out of there. Different kind of tush-push. That's right. Third and two. Smith, 23 of 39. Thrown for 334 yards tonight. Retreats Throws Broken up Fourth down Jordan Lewis is there Intended for Smith and Jigba That time the Wiley veteran Lewis A seven tier man out of Michigan Really good coverage on that crosser Here we go Here we go At the 50 it's a first down or it's the end of the game Seattle 0-2 on fourth three receivers come to the right side keeps D.J. Dallas in the backfield Lockett comes to the slot here comes Parsons and he forces the pass incomplete and that will wrap it up You talk about unabated to the quarterback. Yeah. Obviously a miscue as well as they played tonight. The biggest play of the game. They just let him free.
