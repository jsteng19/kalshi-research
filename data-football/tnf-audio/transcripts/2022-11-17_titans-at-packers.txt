 Rodgers with that hard count trying to draw Tennessee offside. Throws to the outside and incomplete. Couldn't hit Robert Tunyon, who leads the team in receptions. So after the Titans go down the field 83 yards for a touchdown, the Packers go three and out. And this Titans defense, when we talked with him, there's much respect that they have for Aaron Rodgers, who's a Hall of Famer, obviously. They talked about the running game. And that's what they saw on film was an offensive line that was coming off the ball. And they're determined to take that away and try to get Aaron Rodgers into those third and obvious passing situations. They've been great against the run all year. Pat O'Donnell, the longtime Chicago Bear, now in his first year here. Caught by C.J. Board at the 37. And a great tackle is made there downfield after a two-yard run back by a week. Years ago, Amon Green, great running back for Green Bay. But he was wearing sleeves and he was fumbling. And John Mann was working with John, and John said, that's what's causing it. And, of course, the next time we saw Amon Green, the sleeves were long gone. So we'll see. So far, he's looking good. They're not able to get penetration on that first drive. That's the key in defending him. And the 39-yard line starts with a full back out in front of him. Gets to the 42, gain of three. It'll be second down and seven. You know, this year the Titans have been incredible with their opening script. That's the fifth time now. The opening drive, Todd Downing and this offense have gone right down the field and put a touchdown on the board. Only the Vikings have done a better job of that this year. The problem for them has been, of course, the second half. Only four touchdowns the entire year in the second half. But let's see what they do off the script. And none in the fourth quarter. Yeah. Second down call. They gave them two on the play. Henry lines up eight yards back of the line of scrimmage. Play action. Look out, and down he goes at the 31-yard line. Taken down there by Preston Smith. This is the big concern when he drops back to throw. You get a pressure here with a blitz. Derrick Henry does not do a good job, and then you get pressure around the left side, around Daly with Smith. So Derrick Henry is usually better in pass protection than that. Doesn't pick up the rookie. And then look at Preston Smith. Known for his power, but just able to get around and get the corner on Dennis Daly. Third and 17. Keep it on the ground, and this time it's Filliard, who caught that touchdown pass on the first drive. So this drive is stopped in its tracks after three plays. and in comes the punting group and they've got a fantastic punter undrafted rookie Ryan Stonehouse out of Colorado State who leads the league in punting average by almost two yards this guy's averaging over 53 yards per kick Randall Cobb who was just activated back to receive it fields at the 21 yard line and Cobb brings it back to the 22 yard line. So Stonehouse that time with the kick right there. Back win last week. We'll see if they build on it. Yeah, and I think you obviously have to go back to the beginning of the year. You lose your offensive coordinator. You lose your quarterback coach. You lose Devontae Adams. Your offensive line is beat up, especially on the left side. There are a lot of, I think, elements that went into the year, and that's why last week it was so big. Their offensive line finally solidified, able to run the ball and of course the rookie Christian Watson with some vertical shots which is so important to what this offense is about and the latest issue is the thumb but he's playing right through it as Jones picks up nine Byard making the tackle so keeping that hands warm as he does on cold nights like this one at Lambeau Field but he's got that wrap around the thumb yeah I know you guys were able to to see him in person you mentioned it didn't look necessarily like there was a lot of swelling. I know he's excited about the rest after this Thursday night game. They have a bye coming up. Hopefully he's going to be able to get that back to 100%. So after a gain of nine by Jones, second down and one. Jones averaging a sparkling 5.6 yards per run. And he'll work his way here for a gain of five. and a first down for Green Bay. Really, both these sides of the line of scrimmage are going to be a war tonight. You know, you're a throwback game in Latin. Where they excel, they almost always get into the end zone. In fact, they do. This year, 9 out of 9 on first and goal. And 14 in a row going back to last season. Henry, can he get in? He can for the touchdown. So that worked out perfectly for Tennessee. Made a big third down stop. Green Bay was stopping the clock to preserve some time at the end of the half. But now they're going to have a half minute by the time they get the ball back. And in the meantime, Tennessee winds up in the end zone. Yeah, you go back to that third down conversion. Quay Walker blitz. They run a mesh route. He sits down in front of it. Easy throw. Easy read, good patience by Tannehill. And then they come right back and get the edge for Derrick Henry. Josh Lambeau, we'd like to tell you he's a distant relative of Curley, but when you see that he spells the name differently, you know I'm lying to you. But Lambeau picked up the other day, comes off the practice squad, and he's two for two on extra points. Go back and look at his touchdown. You've got a couple of tight ends, Swaim, 87 right here, able to help set the edge. You've got Hooper right here and even Robert Woods involved. They're just trying to get the big man to be able to get to that edge and run downhill. There isn't anybody. You can see Jairo Alexander, no thanks. He doesn't want to get down inside there once you see what Derrick Henry's capable of doing. No way of stopping him once the tight ends and Woods did their jobs. Nine-play drive. We made the point before as you look at Vrabel. Congratulating Woods made that big third down catch. So they've run 38 plays. This is a team that averages only 58 plays per game, tied for the fewest. And right now they're on a pace, not that they will, but on a pace to run 76. That's incredible. This going on the road without Ben Jones, with all the injuries that they have sustained, I don't know if this first half could have gone any better for what Tennessee wanted to do, not just being able to possess the ball, but, again, continue to save, and be able to keep Rodgers and his offense from getting out there and having a chance to put points on the board themselves. Lambeau asked him before the game, what were you doing this time last week? I'm walking my dog. Bullock gets hurt. Tennessee calls. He kicks off here. Keyshawn Nixon collects at the 8. Gets banged down as he crosses the 20-yard line by Dylan Cole. So we're off next week. NBC has the Thursday night game, But we're back in Foxborough in two weeks. The Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots on Thursday night football. 7 Eastern, it starts there. The standings right now, Miami 7-3. Jets are 6-3. Buffalo 6-3. Patriots 5-4. Every team in that division over 500. And Josh Allen and Buffalo, maybe the game of the year last week with Minnesota. Incredible finish. And, of course, they want to get on the right side before they get ready for that game. Buffalo in a lot of high drama games this year. Yes. Save one for two weeks. Yes, please. From tonight. From the 22. Rogers. Does he have time? And he swings it out here to Jones. And he'll step out of bounds. And that stops the clock with 23 seconds. Green Bay will get the ball to start the second half. Of course, they had to use all their timeouts on defense. So, no timeouts to work with. Maybe get aggressive here maybe with one more shot. See if you can get out of bounds or stop the clock. Let's see what Rodgers has up his sleeve here. Three receivers go out to the right side. A little nod sends Jones to the left. Rodgers underneath to Jones. He gets up to the 34. Without a timeout, taking those two on that last defensive drive. Well, I don't think there's any magic here. But the minute, of course, I say that, it'll throw a 60-yard touchdown pass. I don't think so. That's the way the half comes to an end with the Tennessee Titans leading 14-6. And the Lambeau crowd pulling the Packers off the field. Mercedes-Benz halftime show. So, Carissa and the gang coming right up. And Rodgers will start things off as they get the ball to begin the second half. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, and Kaylee Hartung on a night where it started to snow earlier but has stopped game time. Temperature was 26, and right now it's 25 degrees. Tannehill was walking over to the sideline, looking over like, what, what, what? Direct snap to Henry. So they've come up with a few wrinkles tonight that have been working. Right, a few direct snaps and two passes from him. Meanwhile, here is Dillon. Out to the 34. Might see a little bit more of him. Jones limped off the field after the last series. Kaylee, what you got? Well, Al, the Titans defense is out there without Danico Autry. We're told he is questionable or returned with a knee injury. He was visibly upset when he came to the sidelines the last time the defense was on the field. He's in the locker room now, Al. Yeah, that's a loss too. T.R. Tart came off, and he's back in the game. Meanwhile, Rodgers steps to his left. Fires caught. And that's Tom again who takes it inside the 40-yard line. So Rodgers so thrilled to have this guy back, and you can see why. He's made some big plays tonight. Four catches for 63. That's good for 29. Remember, these backers have been very aggressive. So one way to attack aggressive backers is get the ball thrown right behind them, even without play action. Their eyes are still in the backfield, and you're so right, Al. You know, as good as they looked last week, and everybody got excited about Watson making plays, Aaron Rodgers knows how important having Randall Cobb there in the slot can be to really balance him out. Four grabs for him, one for Watson, meanwhile Jones is back in the game. and Aaron is taken out of bounds after a short run. Second down and seven now at the 35 of the Titans. You mentioned Autry being down in Kaylee's report. One thing about this defense with Mike Vrabel is they have missed, last week it was Jeffrey Simmons, they've had a lot of guys that have rotated through there. Right now Mario Edwards is rotated in. They'll keep bringing different bodies in. And there's throughout Williams a defensive line coach is one of the more respected D-line coaches in this league. And he's done incredible work with a lot. Some of these guys have been signed off the practice squad and stepped in and delivered and played well. Send an extra rusher here. Jones fighting his way about three yards shy of the first. You mentioned Jeffrey Simmons. There was some question whether he would play. He missed the game last Sunday, 98, who's normally a major factor. But I don't think we mentioned his name tonight. No, he has an ankle. That's what kept him out last week. And I think he's showing a lot of guts tonight just being in there. He's the alpha of this defense. And really just kind of showing a lot of guts. Tannehill did that last week. Continues to play on a bum ankle. And that's where you get in the middle of November. Guys are having to play through some things. And Simmons doing that tonight. Third and three. Rodgers. Blizzard. Contested makes the catch Instead of a first and goal Covered by the rookie McCreary You get a middle field safety Meaning one on one One of your go to receivers Who's got size at 6'5 Against a rookie Actually pretty good coverage by McCreary But the location of the football Great concentration as well by Lazard Being a 23 and then the pass is a little errant there Watson's starting to slip as he reached for it. It'll be second down and goal. They got a little bit too much depth there. Aaron Rodgers is trying to put the ball in front of him to give him a chance to catch the ball on the move. I think he gets a little bit too deep, and Rodgers puts it where he wants him to be able to have a chance to make a move there right after the catch. And Rodgers saying yesterday, stressing this, I want my receivers to be there on time. That's it. Emphasize there. Be there on time. Yep. Second down and goal. There meaning exactly where he wants to throw it. A little trickery here. Holds on to it. Throws. Touchdown. Watson. his fifth Lambeau leap in four days he's going to work all the way across but you get action this way which affects the eyes of the defense a little fake to dylan a little fake on the end round the defense that has their eyes in the backfield they lost their discipline one of the A few times we've seen that tonight. And there's Aaron Rodgers going to what's become his main two guy when it comes to throwing touchdown passes. Five-point lead, so they'll go for two to try to make it three. Long developing play. Good job by that offensive line giving him enough time. Cam Molden and Hooker, and the kicker is out as well. Randy Bullock with Josh Lambeau having been signed, and he'll kick tonight at Lambeau Field. Meanwhile, Green Bay won the toss, and they have elected to defer. It is Mason Crosby in his 16th season. Hassan Haskins, rookie out of Michigan. Fourth round pick. You see the snow flurries, 26 degrees, and off we go with the kick to the 9-yard line. And the rookie brings it back with a flag thrown up at the 38-yard line taken down there. Bill Vinovich is tonight's referee. Normally moves the game along very nicely. We'll get the call early. And as you can see, against Tennessee. So that backs them up and brings us to Ryan Tannehill. His numbers this year, he missed two games with a sprained ankle. came back last week. ATD's three picks, the rating a little above the league average. Of course, he started with the Dolphins, came to Tennessee, has had a couple of really good years. But working back through that ankle injury, and last week he was effective enough and made a big run late in the first half to get them back in the game against Denver, and they eventually won by seven. Yeah, a big part of his game is his mobility. You mentioned the one play that he was able to get out and pick up that first down. We'll keep an eye on his mobility tonight. A terrific athlete. Played a little conservative early last week, but then settled into the game. Crowd already a factor as he whispers to Henry before the first snap. Off play action. And the fake and the pass is incomplete. Looking for a flag and not getting one. It is Craig Oconquo, the tight end. So they go to him on the first play. It'll be second and ten. All week we've been thinking about, okay, Derrick Henry running the football. They're going to have to get him going. The Packers had struggled against the run, and I think that gives you maybe an idea of what Todd Downing, as a play caller, knows he's going to have to do. Early downs, mix in some play action and some pass just to keep this Green Bay defense honest. Henry. In the 21-yard line. Derrick Henry of course has had a great career Put up some major numbers Could win the rushing championship again This season he'll come out here on third down And right now he and Barkley are 1-2 in rushing Saquon just a few yards in front of him And he picks up three there to get within one of the Giants running back Haskins comes in on third down now Third and seven crowd already at full volume play clock is down to two gotta snap it moving left Tannehill deep downfield and it's going to be hauled in at the 39 yard line Traylon Burks the rookie out of Arkansas who was picked after they traded A.J. Brown to Philadelphia picked him with Philadelphia's draft choice 44 yards Savage is here but breaks down to kind of come down underneath. Creates a man-to-man situation. No safety support. Great recognition by Tannehill. And this is what Titan fans have been wanting to see from the rookie, Burks, out of Arkansas. Can he win? Remember, A.J. Brown's in Philly. They need a receiver to make plays. There's a big one early by the rookie. Threw it over the head of Kayshawn Nixon. Now they go back to Henry. Just banging his lead as he always does with a ton of yardage after contact. He's picked up 83% of his yardage this season after initial contact. That's a great point. Something for fans to keep in mind tonight. When you watch the physicality, you know this about him. 250 pounds. You can see the safety aim is coming in there, just lowering his shoulder. But you cannot lower your shoulder and hope to bring him down. He is so effective with that contact balance. He'll run right through that. So much fun to try to tackle that guy on a 26-degree night, isn't it? Second and one. Off play action. Set up the screen. And banging his way for a first down is Henry after he was initially stopped behind the line to gain. And again, we talked about the fact Ben Jones is out. That's big. It's only the second game he's missed in high school, college, or the pros. And you've got Aaron Brewer, normally a guard, who comes in to snap it. Yeah, an unbelievable challenge for him. And Ben Jones is everything to this offensive line and to this offense as far as his leadership and getting the calls. So Brewer only has 13 career snaps at his center. Torrey Carter, fullback. Rodgers has been sitting there for a long time. Henry's the back. Move Carter over to a wing. give it to Henry and they're going to stop him Preston Smith and Clay Walker 10 minutes 6 seconds they go 18 plays and come up with nothing still 7-6 this size venue in American sports I was able to come over here last night and just take it all in. This is football heaven right here. First and ten from the five-yard line after they stop that long drive. And this is Dillon. Gain of one. Back we go to the fourth and one call. Watch Carter get off a little slow. And because he's slow to get inside, Walker's able to get off the ball pretty quickly. If Carter's able to get down inside, he'd have a chance. It was still overall a really good job in the interior to be able to stack up Derrick Henry there, who was frustrated after that long drive not to come away with a touchdown. And the wall off again. It'll be third down and six. as A.J. Dillon carries the third time tonight for only two yards. Both teams doing a great job against the run tonight. Yeah, this defensive line, they'll rotate a lot of bodies and stay fresh, but I'll tell you, the guys that are really flashing here early in this game against the run have been the two backers long and Cole getting downhill and being incredibly active against this run game. They've held Henry to less than three yards per carry. Jones is averaging 3.3 per carry on a third down and six. Rodgers dancing at the goal line back into the end zone. Has to get out of there. And is able to throw it away. And a flag is down. So Rodgers in jeopardy of maybe getting tackled in the end zone, which of course would have resulted in a safety. That was a... Intentional grounding. Offense number 12. Funt foul. Loss it down. Fourth foul. All right, so it's fourth down now. He was just outside of that goal line. Good job of coverage. You sit him back there in zone. They're taking away all of his options. He wanted to throw it to Dillon, but then just gets rid of the ball. There's nobody there, obviously. Really close. You don't see that very often. It's the first grounding penalty for him since early in the 2020 season. Now, Pat O'Donnell, eight years in Chicago, comes up the lake this year. Punch for Green Bay, and this kick is a short one. It bounces inside the 40 and stops at the 42-yard line, giving Tennessee a short field with 321 across the street from Lambeau. John could have done it. So great to have him honored all weekend long on all of the networks. After that short punt, Tennessee starts this drive with an empty backfield. First down, and they jump, so it's a free play here for Tannehill. And throws that one out of bounds. Kenny Clark came across the line. Offside. Five yards. Keepers over number 97. Five-yard penalty. Retreat first down. I want to bring Terry McCoy in for a second. A lot of people might wonder, why isn't it a safety, intentional grounding in the end zone? So, Terry, explain what happened here. Al, the entire body in the ball has to be in the end zone for the foul to occur in the end zone. We see his left leg in the field of play. That's the spot of the foul, not a safety. So, had he been, the whole body was in the end zone, would have been two points. Intentional grounding. Absolutely. Beautiful. First down and five from the 36-yard line. Henry. Denver did a really good job against Henry last week, and the Packers are doing a great job against him tonight. 15 carries 42 yards. Yeah, and I think the reason they're doing that is you've got Preston Smith who's setting an edge up the top, and then watch the penetration. This is how you exploit this outside stretch play. You get a good push from the interior, get the penetration, set the edge there by Preston Smith and make Derrick Henry have to cut back underneath that edge. To the 14-yard line. Not a lot of bells and whistles and all that, scratching and clawing, but they grind it out, and they grind it out with effectiveness. They really do, and doing just enough with Ryan Tannehill, who's been accurate, making good decisions. He's 9 of 10 so far, and the great thing about having a drive like this, of course, not only being able to eat up the clock, you keep Aaron Rodgers on the sideline. And that's always a good thing if you're playing against the Packers. Fifteenth play of this drive. Tannehill, a little shoulder shake. And then incomplete, way out of the end zone. Robert Woods came over from the Rams, the intended receiver. It's funny, they're last in the league in offense in terms of total yards. In red zone percentage, though, the first, number one, and there they are over the last four years. They get inside the 20-yard line, and they're almost unstoppable. Yeah, and when you brought that up with one of the players this week, I think it was Tannehill, and he said, well, we prep hard. We've worked real hard. I said, well, everybody works at it. Everybody has a plan. What I think it is is you can dominate the line of scrimmage with Derrick Henry, number one, and make defenses have to respect that. And then Tannehill does a good job of being decisive. Get the ball out of his hands. And Tennessee had called a timeout. They were having a tough time getting set there. And they take a timeout here. You've got to love Rabel. I love his expressions. I think Henry had to tie his shoes. There he is. He's tying his shoes. He has to take his gloves off. Well, there it is right there. That'll cost you right there. It'll cost you a timeout anyway. Yeah, right. Trying to get dressed. Like you said, you've got to love raves, right? Whether he's talking to the last man on the roster or he's talking to Derrick Henry, everybody gets treated the same. Teams are always talking about we're buying in. But, you know, you talk to the Titans, and we had the last couple of years done a few of their games. For the most part, they love this guy. They get him. You know what? You might fear him, too, the way he is. No doubt. He'll get into a drill and show you how to do it. Yep. He played so long, and Rodgers has played so long. Braywell, as a player, actually sacked Rodgers twice back in the early 2000s. Second and ten. Play action. Buy time. Pressure put on, though. Tannehill escapes and throws it away. They're trying to catch this defense committed to the run game, but only two receivers, and they are completely taken away. They're just trying to do this quite a bit where you just kind of cross your receivers, try to set up a pick of some sort or got to sit in a soft spot. You can see Jair Alexander back in the corner. He takes that throw away. With only two receivers, you start to scramble. There's just nobody to throw the ball to. Good discipline there by the Packers. Slate put the pressure on. This is the 17th play of the drive. In the pocket. Throws. Woods makes the grab. Now what do you do? Fourth down and one. Chris Barnes makes the tackle. Do you settle for three? Do you go with their prowess in the red zone with a guy like Derrick Henry? Fourth and one. But as soon as Woods was tackled, I happened to look over to the sideline of the Titans and the special teams. The field goal unit, a few of them started to kind of move forward. And Grable stepped onto the field with his right arm to push them back. So he knew what he was doing all along. This drive at the 10-minute mark. And now timeout is taken here by Green Bay. It's so funny. I mean, the time of possession here is 16 minutes to 8. They run 28 plays to 14. Yeah. A lot of odd numbers considering what both teams were coming into this game. Yeah. You know, I think with Vrabel and Todd Downing and this offense, this is kind of what they hope for. Tannehill being smart with the football, being able to run the football, get into this red zone, and then you've got to put points on the board. That's why I think you'll see them being more aggressive. They know when Aaron Rodgers gets the ball back that you always are going to be in the chance of giving up points to him. So when you get down inside the five-yard line, you need touchdowns. So they're going to bring in... Vrabel has sacked Rodgers twice since their careers crossed over each other Of course Mike at the end had a great career mainly with New England He's looking at him like, bro, come on. That's perfect. Come on, man. Yeah. Yeah. You know, Vrabel said something out of the side of his mouth on the way back to the sideline. Gamesmanship, it'll never stop. Third down and 11 now from the 21-yard line. Blitz coming. Rodgers avoids it. Throws incomplete and falling down was Jones that time. David Long was the guy who came in. Jones went down. They're going to have to settle for a field goal attempt on fourth down and 11. As Jones comes hobbling off. They use defensive linemen to occupy offensive linemen. And then they'll bring another pressure from the other side. This time, instead of using a defensive lineman on a twist game, to actually get to second level with David Long. You don't see Tennessee blitz that much. Usually it's a twist game, but this time Long gets home. And now you've got Danico Autry. Seven sacks, leads the team. He's the guy that needs attention. Injury timeout. Injury had nothing to do with the play before. Take a look at this. Here's what happens to him. Yeah, with the big guys, you always get worried about getting rolled up on by another lineman. Autry has been so effective as they dealt with some injuries up front. He's been the bell cow. You mentioned the seven sacks earlier and hopefully he's going to be okay. And block the extra points in the end. Meanwhile Mason Crosby now comes in for a 39 yard field goal attempt. Trying to shave the lead to five. McDonald puts it down and Crosby hits it through and that's the way the first drive of the second half ends as they go 13 plays 51 yards Good Rivals a three-part docuseries on the Mexican and American men's soccer team rivalry comes to Prime Video starting November the 24th just in time for the World Cup Good rivals only on Prime Video. So he cruised down the Fox River and can tell you all-time winningest teams in the history of the league. The Bears and the Packers at this current moment are tied for the most wins. Last time the Bears didn't have at least a share of the all-time wins league back in 1921. So at one point they had a huge advantage, but then Green Bay has been so good over the years they have now caught up. And if Green Bay wins tonight for the first time since 21, they'll be the winningest team in the history of the league. That's great. You're right. You think about these last 25, 30 years in Green Bay, what they've been able to do, how fortunate they've been with Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. Love that shot. Lambeau Field. The National Football League Shrine. kickoff is fielded at the goal line here Hassan Haskins and rookie brings it back flag thrown so from the moment the ball is at the 26 but almost always it's on the return team what else is new Bill Vinovich can't hear you says Bill Oh, yeah, there's a helmet to helmet here. First little foul. Blindside block. Receiving number 40. Half the day to the goal. Green Bay ball. Excuse me. Tennessee ball. First down. Yeah, Hilliard. Mm-hmm. Blindside. Helmet contact. brings it back to the 13. It brings it actually back further than that. I remember when they've been effective offensively, it hasn't just been Derrick Henry who's been, for the most part, bottled up tonight. It's been Todd Downing giving the ball to Ryan Tannehill and throwing the football just enough to be able to back this defense up. Puts him at the 9 to begin this drive. Henry. Game of three. So Henry's now carried 18 times in the game, but they're holding him to less than three yards per catch. You're enjoying your first visit to the Lambeau Field, isn't you? I absolutely just love the last couple days being here at Green Bay. And you know the second half's about to get exciting. Rodgers gets the ball here to start the second half. and looking to put a drive together and get some points on the board. Josh Lambeau sends it down to Keyshawn Nixon from the 6. Not past the 20. Tackled up at the 29-yard line. And moments ago, Kaylee with Matt LaFleur. Coach, the Titans dominated the time of the possession. What does your defense need to do to get off the field? Well, I think we've been doing a pretty decent job stopping the run. It's just we've got to maximize those opportunities on third down. We've got to get off the grass. Now your offense starts the second half with the ball. How do you sustain your own drives? Again, this is going to come down to maximizing our opportunities. Obviously, only having three possessions, limited opportunities in the first half. The one was backed up. We went three and out. So we've got to do a great job of just mixing it up, converting on third down, and we've got to score. First down here, they set up a second and short as the catch is made by Alan Lazard. Just shy of the six, so they begin with a nine-yard completion, second and one. Always amazed to watch Aaron Rodgers and his mechanics, how he throws the football. He gets his core into it. And in an interesting conversation this week, talking to him about, you know, his entire development over the years as a thrower. In fact, said before his MVP year in 20, went back and after some surgery to his knee, he went back and got heavy into the squats again, got his leg strength back. A little spin around there, and the catch is made by Cobb. We made a big third down reception on their touchdown drive. Stopped there by Joshua Kalou. First down. As much as everybody talks about Patrick Mahomes and Matthew Stafford, You know, I think the mechanics of this new throwing style, this rotational throwing, really started with Aaron Rodgers. And he was quick to point out, you know, over the years, so many people have helped him. But Tom Clements, who's back now as his quarterback coach, he was here for a number of years, you know, from 06 to 16. And he said, man, it's great to have him back. But he really changed my mechanics years ago. Look at that big smile. He's so happy to have Tom back. Yeah. Made that point effusively. Yesterday, a little flip back here to Jones, and Aaron Jones is into Titans territory, and that's a first down tackle by Kevin Bayard, and that's a gain of 14 for him. How about Aaron Rodgers, a little ride here. You've got both backs in the backfield. You ride with Dillon, pitch to the outside, taking him back to his college days, right, even though he didn't run much option. He looked like a college quarterback there. Beautiful ride. Such a better athlete than people really realize, but he's just trying to get that ball out on the perimeter where of course Aaron Jones is so dangerous has some space to work with looks like he's playing for Barry Switzer at Oklahoma he did from the 43 the fake rolls left, fires caught, Cobb makes the grab and he gets wrestled down there by Kalou look at Aaron Rodgers and going back to his lower half he talks about a lot of these quarterbacks They talk about creating the power from the ground up. That's why the leg strength is so important. You know, if you think about Dan Marino, Troy Aikman, you know, more of a linear thrower. Everybody threw that way. Now Aaron Rodgers almost falling back and yet creates so much torque and power with the leg strength and the job that he does. There's Tom Clements, of course, back as his quarterback coach with Luke Getzey moving on to Chicago as that offensive coordinator. Tom had retired. Rodgers helped talk him back into un-retiring. And look at that, the power, the move, and it's Dillon. Dillon and Derek Henry are, you know, it's the old cliche about moving the pile. Yeah. That's moving the pile. It sure is, and it's a nice job by Josh Myers in his second year out of Ohio State. The center, a little combo block there where he came down on the tackle and able to climb up to the backer, and then you get a good push there with a 250-pound back behind you. Didn't quite get the first down, but gives him obviously a great chance here in third and short. Third down, one. And getting the first down, burrowing his way to the 31-yard line goes A.J. Dillon. So they've already run a total of six plays on this drive, started from their own 28-yard line, and picked up three first downs along the way. Yeah, they've had a lot of moving parts to this offensive line, but John Runyon's been the one steady rock at the right guard, and he's doing a good job tonight, got a good push last year. Will definitely have to be a guy we'll keep an eye on tonight. Titans picking up a couple of first downs on the game's initial drive. Henry swinging to the outside and picks up a tough three to the 22-yard line. Petit Freire is the right tackle. He's another rookie that the Titans play. He goes up against a rookie, Clay Walker, from Georgia. Gets him on his back and buries him to try to give the edge to Henry. There's that famous stiff arm from the big man. You give him a chance to build up that momentum. He is obviously a tough guy to bring down. And wearing those sleeves tonight. We've got a story about sleeves at Lambeau from years ago, which we'll get into later as Tannehill throws complete. And that'll be another first down here. Austin Hooper, one of their three tight ends. Snow coming in a little bit harder and a little sideways as well as the wind picks up on this 26-degree night. That'll tell you all you need to know. I'll tell you, Todd Downing is a play caller doing a really nice job of mixing up the looks with this attack and how he's put Tannehill in this offense and a very aggressive mindset here on this opening drive on the road. Dontrell Hilliard now in the backfield. Tannehill hangs in the pocket fires caught touchdown to Hilliard first play of the night for him and right off the bat Tannehill to Hilliard and just like that they go 83 yards in 8 plays to take the early lead watch the linebacker play right here with McDuffie you can also see Walker right here Both these guys are kind of feeling their way. You've got pressure here from Amos, kind of pulls back there, the safety blitz. And down in the red zone, Dontrell Hilliard is a real threat to catch the football and find ways to get into the end zone. Again, Todd Downing, aggressive, throwing the football on first and ten, really helped Tannehill in this offense out. Hilliard's fourth receiving touchdown, and here is Josh Lambeau, just signed to replace Bullock and bangs it through just barely. So we have played. Four minutes and 29 seconds. And the Tennessee Titans come in. Hockey game, and this is one of the games. Nixon to run it back. Slipping flag is down. So we've had penalties on both runbacks tonight. And Rodgers will come out and probably start a little bit deeper in his own territory. During the return, holding, receiving the number 27. Ten-yard penalty, first down. So Aaron Rodgers coming off his best game of the season. That great comeback. His numbers from last week, 14 of 20. Fewest attempts he's made this year, fewest completions, but those three touchdowns all to Watson. And he's season-high rating. So many people talking about the rookie Watson this week, and they should. It was great to see him have his moment, but having a healthy offensive line and being able to run the ball really got them going. two good runners of course in Jones and Dillon and here goes Jones and the Titans are right there with that good front including David Long coming up from his spot at linebacker to stop him from no game even a loss of one let's call it second and 11 Matt LaFleur is in his fourth season as the head coach Matt, before he came here spent one season with Mike Vrabel as the offensive coordinator in Tennessee 43-16 his mark but coming into the season he's only lost 10 games in three years he's already lost six this season Jones and Dylan now both in the backfield a little flip to the outside Jones and he picks up about four or five yards Aaron Jones sixth year in the league a great find in the draft last day of the draft Texas El Paso picked in the fifth round and he's done the job ever since he's come here Looked great as a rookie, and he's been steady and solid throughout his career. Everybody thinks about Dillon as the power guy, but if you really study Aaron Jones, yeah, he's quick, he's shifty, makes people miss, but not afraid to lower his shoulder and run through tackles himself. They empty it here, third and six. Pushed there on an obvious third and short where they had to run the football. Rodgers buy-in time Rodgers deep downfield and that's incomplete in the back of the end zone in the back corner of the end zone crowd wanted the flag as they always do that's Lazard covered there by Roger McCreary no flag second down yeah the rookie out of Auburn you know I really never locates the football. And I think that's what the reaction is from the crowd. Terry McCauley kind of, Roger McCreary is saying, you know, hey, put me out on an island here, give me a chance. And Aaron Rodgers, of course, thought that there should have been P.I. Terry McCauley saying, no, sir. Nope. No penalty. And so did the crew as well, which is the most important, of the factors as Rodgers gets under pressure again, steps away from a sack, eyes downfield, and then throws a little behind Lazard that time. Lazard had gotten free at the 14-yard line. Joshua Kalouz made a couple of plays in the secondary that time came through and put the heat on to get Rodgers out of the pocket. Yeah, Lazard just kind of does a good job. Now that he has experience of working with Aaron Rodgers, he has an idea of what to expect. Here he is back in the back end. And watch how he ends up just kind of working with Rodgers. Rodgers locates him late, and he kept drifting. Instead of settling, he kept drifting. Rodgers trying to push him back more to the middle of the field, away from the defender. They're unable to connect. Here's a third and ten. Caught. First down. He goes right back to Lazard. Needed ten. Got eleven. First down. takes advantage of that matchup against Terrence Mitchell, who's in soft coverage and losing ground. He says, okay, if you're going to lose ground, you're going to give me this throw on third down and long? We'll take that. Easy throw. Great connection there. Good recognition again by Rodgers pre-snap to see the matchup that he wanted. Rodgers now into triple figures, 12 of 17 for 104. Watson on the end of the round. Picks up a couple. McCurry forces him out of bounds after a gain of about three. The red zone area for this Green Bay team throughout the year has not been great. In fact, once they get inside to 30, they've not been very effective. Now last week against Dallas, especially when they were down 28-14, things began to click. but they need a touchdown right here they do not want to settle for a field goal on this opening drive the ball five and a half minutes to the ground Jones outside but the Titans are right there and gang tackle him at the 21 yard line third down loss of 4 third and 11 Quanu really does a nice job of setting this edge here and getting off of the block of Runyon Watch the right guard here will pull around. He's able to shed that, keep his outside shoulder free. Disrupts the timing completely. Crowd is upset because the officials are holding it. Rodgers went to the line, but now you've got Pierre Tartt is down, and, of course, the crowd thinks this is an Academy Award performance. And Fravel says, well, we wouldn't do that. Tart started to jog off the field and then just went down. You see this all over football, especially against a guy like Aaron Rodgers, who's going to go fast, and he just kind of goes down and grabs his ankle. That's what the crowd's reacting to. I'd love to get Terry's thought on this. Terry, it's unethical, but it's not against the rules. Is that a fair way to say this? Well, we really don't know. He may very well be injured. The officials are going to stop the game no matter what. But I would say they're holding up. So it looks like Green Bay may have substituted. They're holding up the line. So he would have been able to get off anyway to complete their substitution. So they really didn't gain an advantage here. Right. The officials were actually up there to stop play because of exactly what Terry said. And then Tartan, of course, just gilded the lily a little bit, you might say. See, Vrabel and Aaron Rodgers, who know each other pretty well, a few words. Rodgers had a few words for Rabel Hey Mike He mentioned before doing such a good job of being able to get off of blocks and setting the edge with him in these zone plays if you allow him to be able to get downhill on you obviously we've seen it a couple times but when he's really rolling that's where he's a challenge and they've done a good job on the edges and being able to get some penetration Pressure. Tannehill throwing open and trying to make the grab. And does he? Along the sideline, the officials look at each other. Yes. At the 44-yard line. Chig Okwanko, the tight end who caught the first pass from Tannehill tonight and makes the grab here and stays in. Great play, 31 yards. And off they go again quickly to the 49-yard line. One of those things where you don't want to give the opponent a chance to throw the challenge flag. Akwankwo really has wide receiver skills. He's a rookie out of Maryland. Good job. Looks like he gets his elbows underneath. Terry says it is, in fact, a catch. But I'll tell you, there's a bust in coverage there. Remember, Darnell Savage has moved from the back end at safety up to that nickel back. That time he got lost between is it man or is it zone. He got stuck in coverage and they were able to bust and make him pay for it in the back end. Ball can touch the ground. You have control of it as he did. Sets up the screen to Henry. Cuts inside. Turns it into a big gator. Turns it into almost a touchdown as he gets inside the 10-yard line. Adrian Amos finally runs him down. Sets up the screen, makes that cut to the inside, and that's for 41. Good time to call this. I want you to watch. Remember Brewer trying to make the adjustment at center. Gets caught right there and gets away with it. And then they get the ball out in front. He's got a convoy in front of him. And, again, whether it's running the football or catching it, you just get 250 pounds running with some momentum. And I'll tell you, he's got so much speed to go along with that power. It feels natural in the open field. Billiard comes back into the game now. Woods makes the grab. and again they're in that first and goal situation where they're 10 for 10 this year and have made 15 straight over two seasons. Second and goal. Think about what you just said. I mean that is, that's not a fluke. That's consistency, that's having a plan, that's knowing how to attack a defense, find the soft spots, whether it's running the ball or giving the ball like they did there to Tannehill to find a matchup where you can get the ball out to Woods. And like I said, he's decisive. He's more decisive in this area and no one were to go with the ball in any other area on the field. Very good point there. Statistics bear that out. Henry is back in. Out of the pistol this time. And he's going to throw it. Henry's going to throw it, and it's Austin Hooper for the touchdown. So the entire defense has to be thinking about a run in that situation. And what happens here? Henry with a big smile from Rabel, who knows what it's like to catch a touchdown pass. He did it tons of times through his career. Well, you're so worried about stopping Derrick Henry. Everybody's coming up to stop him. The linebackers, the safeties. Obviously, the last thing you're expecting is the big fella to do a jump pass for a touchdown. Great call. Moving forward, second of his career. Had one last year. Josh Lambeau for the point after. And that one off the upright. So it at least gives the crowd something to cheer about. 91 yards, six plays. Henry to Hooper. 20-9. There they are. Henry to Hooper. You had that on your dance card. just won a lot of money Josh Lambeau to kick off backing up a yard into the end zone Keyshawn Nixon and Nixon has a run back out to the 31 yard line tripped up by the kicker Lambeau we go back to the TD Great job of just being innovated as an offensive play caller with Todd Downing. Watch the patience by Hooper. Watch the offensive line, by the way. Not getting downfield. Probably the tightest spiral we've seen all night there by Derrick Henry. Really good look at 81. Weights, waits, then releases. Allows everybody to come up to try to make a tackle on Derrick Henry. But we've seen Todd Downing. Membo here. Too bad the snow went away. But Josh Myers against Thierry Tartt in the middle will be a great battle. You have Jeffrey Simmons. This defensive front, they've battled through some injuries. They've maintained their culture and their aggressive nature. Terrell Williams, their defensive line coach, one of the best in the country. They have a real attitude about them when they play together. Kind of an unselfish bunch. Spreaded it out for him. But when the snow went away, it'll be back. Trust me. Pass to the flat. And meeting the yard right there. Jones gets it as Fulton. makes the tackle there, second down and nine at the 36-yard line. That is a great play by Christian Fulton, who's really become the leader of the guys on the edge. Wasn't able to play last week, but able to get off the blocks. He got three blockers, essentially, out there with the two tight ends and a receiver. See, Aaron Rodgers, he thought he had what he wanted, but underestimated the ability of Fulton getting off that block. Second and nine. Rodgers over the middle. Alton making the grab to the 40-yard line goes Randall Cobb. Crowd loves him. Rodgers loves having him back. That's a gain of 24. They blitzed Kalou right here, and it opens up a soft spot in the zone right behind Bayard. and this is an offense that if you can get Aaron Rodgers timed up with Randall Cobb, so tough to stop. They went right at the blitz from Kalou and found a soft spot in the zone right behind it. Cobb missing four games. Picked up 24 on that one. Play clock is down to two. Rodgers under center. Dillon, nothing. Stacked up by a bunch of blue shirts behind. The line of scrimmage led by Demarcus Walker. These linebackers are getting downhill in a hurry. It looked like Rodgers may have him. You talked about how he uses his cadence, but this time he gets to a run check that he thinks is going to be effective with that shaded nose. But look how quickly they're getting off the blocks. And, again, you see Cole and Long firing downhill, which I'm sure Rodgers is going to come back and try to make them pay for that with play action throws over the middle behind those downhill linebackers. 1-18! Punch three receivers to the right. Short flip to Dillon on the left. And Dillon is about a yard short of the first down. So A.J. Dillon played at Boston College. Picked in the second round in 2020 on a load at six feet and around 247 pounds. And boy, you have Jones and you have Dillon. You've got a great one-two punch, obviously. Oh, yeah. I mean, I think he continues to show what he can do. He's got soft hands. Again, you think about him between the tackles, but both these guys kind of go against the script. He can get outside when he has to. Jones, of course, can show you some power. That time, a nice job of picking up some yards. Give him a chance here on third and short. First down. Moore. Falls out. Jones picked up the first down. Tines, of course, will signal they have it, but it all depends on the officials here, and it is Green Bay with the recovery here. So the ball out just for a moment. The Randall Cobbs hustle here to be able to come up with that fumble and what a jump cut there from Jones. The initial penetration he gets around. Kalou puts his helmet right on the ball, pops out. You'll see 18 from the left somehow get in here the last second and get that football for the Packers. Yeah, Fulton couldn't get it. He had it and then Watson comes in. And so leave it to Cobb, who's back after those four games, makes a 24-yard reception, saves the bacon right here. Final two minutes of the quarter from the 25. Flipping out here, short pass, caught by Tunyon, stays in bounds, and Robert Tunyon picks up the first down. Byard making the tackle. Aaron Rodgers, that's one way, loves to get the ball out of his hands quickly. A couple simple throws, one to Dillon out of the backfield. These backers are going to get downhill, get the ball out on the perimeter, make these corners, have to tackle a big back and now a tight end, get some positive yards here. Rodgers throwing shorter than ever this year. Of course, part of it is the new receivers and all that, but he is at 85 completions behind the line of scrimmage, which is eight per game. Yeah, most in the NFL. Hell Christian Watson bottom of the screen wide to the right from the 15-yard edge where you have that penetration from Kenny Clark Empty again go five wide on a second down and four Two and a half to go Pass is caught That Robert Woods Buffalo and then the Rams. And came over here, picks up the first down. Ball is out fast by Tannehill and accurate throws. Again, we're seeing him make really good throws in rhythm. Second week back after sitting out a couple games. Watch this ball get out even before Woods comes out of his break. It makes it easy to be able to secure the football and then just get, see that ball is out, catch, first down. Two minute warning coming up. And does before the snap. Two minutes to the end of the half. Tennessee 7, Green Bay 6. Away we go. Two minutes to the half. Burks takes the handoff. Wayne Walker makes the tackle there. How about Derrick Henry? Yeah, take the snap again. Pretty cool to see. It's not just Derrick Henry taking a direct snap and trying to run the football. He's able to show that he can play a little quarterback there, getting that ball off. Just looking back to Vrabel going for it, that's his nature to go for it and be aggressive. on the road. He's a one-point lead. Goes for it. Doesn't make it. Now you've got Aaron Rodgers pinned inside the five-yard line. Your defense does their job. They get a three and out. Short punt. Now you get the ball back in plus territory with two minutes to go. You can see the confidence that he has in his defense and that decision to go for it there. People tuning in saying 7-6 is another Thursday night game. Folks, if you're just doing it, this is a pretty cool 7-6 game. A lot of A lot of interesting and strange stuff going on, which we love. Second out of nine. With 152. Tannehill 11 of 14 for 105. Henry to the outside. They bottle him up again. Clay Walker makes the tackle there, and Green Bay will take another timeout. They don't want to let Tennessee run the clock all the way down, and we're back in 30 seconds. Aaron Rodgers has spent a lot of this first half in that posture. The two coaches are right there. Tennessee, 2-1 ratio in plays. Big advantage in yardage, almost 2-1 time of possession. LeFleur wants the crowd to get into it on a third down and seven from the 27-yard line. Tannehill throws, caught, and that's going to be a first down just enough to the 18-yard line goes Robert Woods. Nice switch release there, and even though Green Bay is playing zone, Woods showing that experience sinks down in front of the coverage and then backpedals for the first down. Now from the 18 to the outside, Woods. and he's out of bounds at the 10-yard line. Tackled there by Alexander with 120 to go. Robert Woods, of course, with the Rams, had the ACL last year, getting healthier and healthier every single week and understanding his role in this offense. He's been a great blocker, leads him in receptions, but you just know what he's capable of doing and being a good complement to Burks on the other side in this running game with Derrick Henry. Second and three. Titans have one timeout. Tannehill. Out of the end zone, so that will make it third down and three with 116. Thought he might try to get the ball to Hilliard, who scored the touchdown earlier. He was leaking out late out of that backfield. It's really a tough matchup for these linebackers. Hilliard comes back into the backfield. On a third and three, Tannehill throws, caught, and that's going to set up a first and goal as Burks takes it to the four. They've got a ton of time, even though they have only one time out. You can milk the clock a little bit here. You've got 60 seconds coming up right now. Yep. No rush at all. And first and ten is Newark, Chris, and the guys. Wrapping things up from Green Bay. Should take a look at Gravel and Henry. Got to love it if you're a Titan fan. Google Pixel Buzz Game Show. Right after these messages. Line. Short pass again, and that's caught here by Alan Lazard. He makes his first grab of the night for a gain of a couple. And that's just where he feels that he's got enough cushion to just flip it out. I almost look at that as an extension of their run game. You know, just get the ball out of the hands quickly, as accurate and as good of a decision maker as Aaron Rodgers is. It's a simple throw, and it gives you some positive yards. second and eight tenth play of the drive started back at their own 22 yard line nothing Jones in his tracks David Long is there and in the waning seconds of the first quarter the teams will be flipping ends well maybe not they want to try to get a playoff here Rogers trying to catch him off guard and back with a flag down where they said is the question and Rogers will throw to the back of the engine will be caught there by Watson for the touchdown but what about the flag the flag and for the moment the Packers celebrate the fireworks go off and it's against the Titans they were set touchdown That sums up Aaron Rodgers right there. I mean, he recognized, you know, he got Titans running off the field. He's going to try to get a 12th man, get a free play like he always seems to do, kind of directing traffic, puts one up in the air, and lets the young guy go up and make a play on the football. So you would think every other team in the league would go, okay, that's it, you know, a few seconds left, but not Rodgers. He got, I have a chance, catch another guy on the field in the waning seconds, Gets the flag. Gets the touchdown. And that is an extra point that gets blocked here. And that will mark the official end of the first quarter. Looks like the archery. Meanwhile, you got the ball being picked up. The ball is still alive. Remember the rules put in a few years ago about the ball is alive. You can run it back for two points. So they picked the ball up and ran it back to the 21. And that is the bet, I guarantee you, at the end of the quarter. 7-6 after one. Exciting first quarter back at length. We'll just have to come back. I appreciate the fact that they kept fighting. We've lacked the extra point. What do you make of what your offense did in the first quarter? Well, I mean, we got off. We started to get the first first down, put a drive together and scored. And then went three and out and didn't handle pressure. So, you know, I think it's going to be huge to get the first first down of every drive. Thanks, Coach. All right, thank you, Kaylee. Al Michaels, Kirk Street with Kaylee Hart. I think Rodgers is something else. and what he did at the end of the quarter. And we'll talk about that in a second as Haskins runs it back out past the 30. Grable giving Rodgers credit. I mean, he might have got the card, the whole thing. I know. From the 33-yard line. Derrick Henry is the running back. He gets it. Nice hold, but that closes very quickly after a game of two. Nobody's better at the free plays at home since 2008 when he became a starter. 12 touchdowns, most in the league, 807 yards. Those free plays are when you get up there, you're trying to catch the defense offside, too many men on the field. And then, of course, you've got nothing to lose once that happens. And then you just flip it up, hope for the best, and your rookie star makes you grab. And by the way, not only is he directing traffic, the awareness to put it up in the air. Remember, this rookie, he's got speed, but he's 6'4". Go up and high point the ball. Right. Second down and eight. Play action. They use a ton of that. And that's caught there by Nick Westbrook-Akine. But the flag thrown. Packers indicate it's against the Titans. And Bill Vinovich tells us. That's their appearance. Defense number 26. Incorrect. Penalty declined. Result flip. Penalty. On Savage, and that's a first down. I think this is a matchup that they want to try to exploit. Savage, who is a safety, because of some injury concerns, has had to move down to that. Defense over 26. Spot foul. Automatic first down. He's had to move down to that nickel corner spot, and they feel if they can get him isolated, they can make some plays. It's actually tight coverage, obviously, with the pass interference, but that'll be a matchup, I think, throughout the night to see if the Titans can try to win and try to hit a big play on. Joe Barry calling the defense. Opening minute of the second quarter. Titans up by one. Quick throw to the outside. Nothing happening right there, though. Catch is made there by Burks. And Douglas is right there to stop him. No game. Again, you see it. We see it every single week when you watch football, college, and pro quarterbacks. Saw it earlier with Aaron Rodgers. Some people call that a run-pass option. I think it's more of an alert when you feel that your guy can win one-on-one. He looked out there and saw Burks against Douglas and thought he'd make him miss five to seven positive yards, but Douglas makes the play out in space, does a nice job in coverage there. Spotted at the 40, lost a one, second and 11. Shifting gears. But not much happening there. They try to rip the ball out. Kenny Clark is right there. The big nose tackle. Third and long. And again, we talked about Brewer moving over to center. And you get the big man right here, Kenny Clark. He's got power. He's got burst. And here he's able to just push Brewer. Keep in mind, Brewer's been a guard, right? He's playing left guard. He knows how to play center. He did it in college. But now you're at Lambeau Field. You're trying to make calls to your left and your right. You got 97 across from you. A guy that's been a two-time Pro Bowler and one of the top interior nose guards in the entire league. Third down 10. Here they come. Pressure on. Pick up the blitz. Throw is caught. Nice grab there. Hooper makes the catch. and they will spot the ball beyond the yellow line and the first down. How about the accuracy here? He finds a matchup that he wants with Ford who's up from safety going up against a big fella, Hooper 81. Puts this ball away from the defender and up high. Risky throw there on third down, but it pays off for Tannehill and a good job by Hooper extending to get the first down. What a great accurate throw there Tannehill on the mark tonight Six out of seven And they're taking a look right here Can you look at the spot? Interesting because Initially signal a first down And then they're going to look at the spot Because it was challenged So that was a Third and ten and if they're going to challenge a spot it might as well be after a third and ten so they had already moved the sticks and the down box had first down and then LeFleur who's 50 yards away from the plate heard from upstairs And, you know, I mentioned before, you're not going to challenge something on a second down. But if it's the difference between third down and fourth down, you've got a shot. Chance of converting according to the next-gen stats right there. Fourth and inches. Powered by AWS. You run it. You've got almost three chances in four. You're passing about 58%. So Tannehill comes up. He'll take it in a pistol for the moment. Now he comes up. Back of center. And they snap it to Henry. So Tannehill walked away as if he was out of the play. Looked toward the bench. And they snap it right to Henry, who had lined up just behind him. Just directly behind him. And Tennessee signals first down. We'll see where they spotted. Pretty good acting there by Tannehill. Looks sober. He's acting like he's making a check. Then he looks over to Todd Downey. What have we got here? And then direct. I honestly thought Derrick Henry, as big as he is, I thought he might have elevated a little early, but he's able to pick up the first down. Needed a couple of inches and got them. Now it's Henry again to the 45-yard line. Another direct snap there to Derrick Henry, just like we saw on fourth down. The whole thing with Henry, as we all know, as big and powerful as he is, he's got to get downhill to be effective. Green Bay trying to get penetration, trying to make him reset his feet, reshuffle those feet, slow him down. So two good snaps to him in a row. And on a handoff, more conventionally, is a yard shy of the first out of the 40-yard line. T.J. Slayton makes the tackle there. Third and one. Watch Nate Davis, 64, the right guard. Really good block here. Gets his body turned. Gets his backside. See him here. Watch him turn his body away from the hole. That's exactly where they're trying to go. Right behind that block. Really good job there of kind of setting that up and getting Reed pinning him into the inside. Henry, nine carries, 30 yards. to Henry again. Keeps fighting and gets that first down. As we said before, 83% of his yardage after contact. He's as tough to bring down as anybody. And as the game goes along, he gets stronger and stronger. First five carries in the game, 4.1, lower than the league average. Carries 6-10, almost 5. 11-plus, and that means in the fourth quarter a lot. He is the stud. And what doesn't show there on the next-gen stats as he gets stronger, those safeties and linebackers get weaker and more fatigued. It's hard to tackle that guy for 60 minutes. He gets a rest. They bring in Hassan Haskins. Rookie fourth-round pick out of Michigan. And Tennessee takes a timeout. Only 10 guys on the field, and we are back in 30 seconds. only 10 guys were on the field so they brought Haskins in Henry came out, there they are coach is a little confused as you can see and they're trying to figure out who's that 11th guy right, might have been Cody Hollister who was on the sideline number 8 looking as if he was about to come in keep Haskins in now but they've been throwing on first and 10 pretty effectively tonight They throw again And they throw with effectiveness into a lot of traffic Catch made there by The man who picked up That's Burks, Traylon Burks The man who Earlier tonight Big gain to get him rolling He's carried Or he's caught three now for 48 yards Of course he had the turf toe earlier Went on the IR, missed four games, came back last week. And, you know, he has size and speed to give you yards after the catch. If there's anybody on this roster who could be the A.J. Brown type of guy, physically, it's the rookie. Woods in motion, second and four. Henry back in the game. Be third down and one now. Kaylee. Al, you guys were talking about how Derrick Henry gets stronger as the game goes on. Well, according to his trainer, the king is getting even more powerful as he gets older. For the past five off-seasons, he's been working out with Melvin Sanders five days a week, twice a day. Lifting weights with chains on him, running up hills. The stuff only Derrick Henry could do. The only thing that stopped him last year was a foot injury halfway through the season. He did come back for the one playoff game, and here he goes again, taking bodies with him. needed one wound up here getting more than that and a first down game five aaron brewers holding his own i mean it's not like he's pushing kenny clark around but the fact that we've only seen a player two where he's losing ground is a win tonight you know he's got a lot of combo blocks here he's working with nate davis but he's doing a pretty good job remember just setting the line making sure everybody's on the same page is what you lose from not having ben jones out there from behind Tannehill is hit but he's able to stay in the pocket get the pass away Hurks making the grab Quay Walker the rookie out of Georgia there top pick in the draft makes the stop I thought Daly might get caught there with a hold on the left side Preston Smith is working against him continues to try to get around and work that edge. Watch that left arm hook, and at the end, especially pull there to try to keep him off for the quarterback. Titans running their 24th play of the half. Deep drop. Flips it out here to the tight end, Swain. I bring up that number because the Titans run as few plays as any team in the league in the mid-50s. So when you have a total of 24 and you still have half the quarter to play, they're way above their pace. No doubt. It's a great point. In fact, they're over eight minutes alone on this possession. They get into the red zone. They've talked all week about touchdowns. They're the best in the league. Yeah, eight and a half minutes on this drive. Henry again. Only gone for one so far this year. Didn't make it. As you saw, the league average of success on a two-point play is 44%. Try to cut it to 20 to 17. Goes empty here. Jones comes around. Jones takes the flip. Jones gets in. Robert Tunyon. Big block to lead it. Off they go for 69 yards in a little over three minutes. 2-0-4 left in the third. 2017 Tennessee. Derrick Henry, a little creativity. Tannehill sailing. What's going on? Direct snap. Here you're seeing the big fella hand it off. And then the last touchdown. Run the football. Get the safety and linebackers up. Patience by Hooper. And then the touchdown pass. by Derrick Henry in their last possession. Very creative. It has to be fun working on those plays in practice, and yet you have so little practice time before a Thursday game. I don't know if I had that in the books for Sunday. Yeah, that one might have been around since camp. Right. Coach will never call that. Short kickoff, 11-yard line. Haskins with a run back and sets them up all the way up at the 39-yard line. We go back to Kaylee. Wow, coming off that Christian Watson touchdown. Let's talk about the impressive numbers he put up at the combine at 6-4. Here in four days, five touchdown catches in, what, 96 hours or so? Ruffling. On first down here, three-yard game. Henry on carry number 20. And TJ Slayton set a nice game tonight. Riley on the grass here at Lambeau. He's been playing a lot more tonight because you've seen four big D linemen along with those three linebackers. Chip called. He's even from that age. Ended up coaching my son and his son together on a flag football team in like 2007 when he's still a Patriots player. Here's Tannehill back on first down. Open is Woods. And Woods for a big game inside the 30 to the 28-yard line. Tackled there by Chris Barnes. Game of 32 yards. Again, play action. Everybody expecting Derrick Henry. They're attacking the line of scrimmage. They've been doing it all night. Good play action fake by Tannehill. Nice big opening behind the linebacker there. Chris Barnes off that play action fake. Come right to the line. And take their time once they're there. Meanwhile, Slayton limped off. He's out for the moment. Walked off under his own power. Here's Henry. You hosted Vrabel in college? Yeah, a number of different things. He was a hot shot recruit coming out of northeast Ohio, looking at Ohio State. He had the same first. I heard LaFleur as his first offensive coordinator. And LaFleur was telling us last night, LaFleur actually went in for a head coaching interview there, along with Vrabel. Tannehill slings it to the outside. Snatch. Going first down there by Westbrook Akine. Two touchdown passes last week. They went with Woods in motion. Defensive back there. Savage followed him. He knows he has man-to-man. He looks left at Woods. Comes all the way back to the right. Makes another good throw. On to the fourth. We go. Good one. At Lambeau. 20-17. Titans. End of three. So Green Bay still very much in the hunt for a playoff spot. Meanwhile, first and ten here, start the fourth quarter. Hilliard is the running back at the 16-yard line. Fake to him. Tannehill to the end zone in between defenders. Hooper does not make the grab. Looked around. Meanwhile, the ball is out. He's signaling incomplete pass, so this means nothing on the other end here. And we'll take a look here. But Hooper, in between two defenders, could not grasp it. Yeah, he gets in between the corner outside and the safety here. That ball has to be thrown fast, which it is. He got it in there. Hooper just, when he gets hit, unable to hold on to the football. But what a throw by Tannehill. It looked like he came down with the ball and it came out late. You know, there's Ford who had two interceptions the other day. This could be... Well, it's not a scoring play. It has to be challenged. and he did I thought it was a touchdown if anything exactly right Henry gain a one Green Bay trying to slow down this running game they knew that they'd come in and have to play with four down linemen and a couple backers see one in six or backers walked up to set the edge so it leaves Chris Barnes in the middle by himself and it creates one-on-one opportunities to try to win and get off the offensive linemen and try to get into that backfield which has been very effective. What's been hurting them is by playing that defense. You got Ryan Tannehill's 20-24 through the air for 263-2. Henry, right there. You got Jonathan Garvin and the rookie, Kingsley Enigma. And on the outside of these backers, you're just setting the edge. You're trying to win in the inside. Here you want to win here, win here, and then create a wall on the inside. Don't let Derrick Henry bounce anything. You can see all the leverage is pointing him and funneling him to the inside. And then you're getting off of blocks in the middle, led by Kenny Clark and Jaron Reed. And Nick Barry in there. Third down and nine now. crowd full throat Haskins in the backfield Tannehill complete first down Westbrook Akine he of those two touchdown grabs last week and they come up big on third down it was third and nine good for 19 you'll see Ford right here look at the cushion that he gives and you're going to take advantage of that again when Ryan Tannehill is able to throw and throwing rhythm and on time. He is at such confidence right now, coming back from that ankle injury in his second game. Ball is out on time, out in front of these receivers, and with that soft coverage, it makes it that much easier on third down. Henry, bouncing, trying to get free. Nice run after initial contact. Stopped by Adrian Amos, Dane in nine, second and one. You mentioned Tannehill. And, you know, it's funny, you can overlook that ankle injury. Yeah. But it bothered him last week. We talked about him. He was really sore. He didn't know how he was going to feel tonight. And a 25-degree, 24-degree night, pretty good. It looks great. And, you know, when you have an ankle like that, it can just hang around, you know, and bother you at any moment. But tonight, knocking on wood for him, he looks great. And, like I said, he's strong with confidence we've not seen for a while. 21 to 25 for 282 Off play action, fires Intercepted at the 14 Rasul Douglas And tackled up at the 34 yard line by Tannehill So right after we're talking about Tannehill and the big 97 Throws the pick Exactly what Green Bay needed to try to get back into it Down by 10 From the 34-yard line. Oh, man. So, Douglas with the interception. Tannehill. Two TDs tonight. But that pick. And now can Rodgers and company get back and make it a one-score game? Jones. picks up about eight flag and the backers start to walk back holding offensive at 73 10-yard penalty repeat first down Josh Nyman and meanwhile on the ground Tart take a look at what happened to the nose tackle He's had a busy night in the interior of that defense. Right there, leg goes up in the air. Now let's go back to this interception. And a wrinkle here by Joe Barry, the defensive coordinator. Look, it's second and one. So you've got two tight ends, a fullback in. Here's the corner that ends up dropping in coverage with Sewell Douglas. Second and one. You're expecting a run. Watch the corner drop immediately. And the thing is, Ryan Tannehill never looked that way. Tannehill looks left. He's sizing up the receiver. Does not see that corner. Doesn't expect on second one that Douglas would drop back into coverage. So good recognition there by Douglas Good job by Joe Barry making sure of the awareness there The only receiver that went out on that second one And down You can look at it two ways but it wasn ruled a scoring play If you're brave, well, you're going to challenge this. He had possession of the ball. He went to the ground. Right. He's got the flag out. Terry, come on in here for a second. That's what he plays. That's what he plays on the field. It's a touchdown. Wow. Now, after signaling incomplete, now they rule it a touchdown. Now it gets reviewed automatically. I mean, you see his secures the football. Knee is down. He's touched. I mean, he's dead. Terry, you saw the early official comes in, says incomplete. Then another look at it here. You guys got it exactly right. He clearly controls the ball all the way through contact with the ground. It's then knocked out. He's got it long enough. This is a touchdown. That was replay-assisted to a touchdown, by the way. Had to be, no question about it. It's originally ruled incomplete. Now the extra point here by Lambeau. So once again, Tennessee gets inside the 20. We're the best in the league. And they finally have a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Yes, there you go. First time this season. Yeah, what a throw again by Tannehill. He knew where he wanted to go with the football. Based on the alignment of this defense, comes off the play action, looks that safety off. Now he's got to throw it on a line, which he does. He gets it in there. Great job by Hooper of being able to lock in. And look at the eyes. Move that safety. Come back. Put the ball out in front. Take care of the ball. Protect it. But the replay assisted. Yeah. Got it right. Communication got it dead right. Yeah. Meanwhile, the run back here. Up to the 25 goes Keyshawn Nixon. You saw Vrabel with his... He was ready to challenge right away if they did not turn it over. We mentioned it's their first touchdown in the fourth quarter. All season took them all of five seconds. Hooper's been effective down in the red area tonight. Of course, the touchdown pass on the jump throw by Derrick Henry, and then this one from Tannehill. So the Packers, as was the case, last Sunday against Dallas, down by two scores. Of course, in that game, they were down by 14. tonight down by 10 and again a team that had lost five in a row trying to win its second in a row double fake Rogers deep downfield and incomplete trying to get it to Watson he was taken down and it looked like after the play Christian Fulton covering on to play. The officials letting him play. Bayard comes up, so you've got a one-on-one matchup with Watson against Fulton. It's a heck of a matchup. We saw what happened last week against Dallas. He lets up just a little there in the middle of his route instead of continuing to gain momentum. And that may have been the difference between having a chance on that ball and it falling in front of him. Looking back over his head. no flag Terry saying the dead right call Rodgers meanwhile right now out of the gun here hands the ball off short game here for Aaron Jones up to the 26 yard line and that'll make it third down and seven coming into tonight the Titans had the best third down defense in the NFL and it's because they do a good job of mixing up looks. A lot of times they don't blitz. They rush with four. They'll stunt and twist up front, but their backers and safeties and corners keep their eyes on the football because they can get pressure just by bringing the four. It has been, as you say, the best third down defense for tonight. Green Bay is five out of eight on third down. Rodgers dancing around. Throws and incomplete. Under pressure that time. Coverage was good as well, Tunyon the intended receiver, and a very fast three and out series. See, this time they're actually able to bring pressure with just the four, but they man up and play with the safety back. You got a little robber there with fire, but there's nobody open. Where are you going to go with the football here? You can see Aaron Rodgers trying to, that's a combination of good pressure up front, good coverage on the back end. They marry the two up, and you get Rodgers off the field on third down. O'Donnell's third punt of the night. Short. Bouncing ball. Collected inside the 30 and then slammed to the ground. His board just called up. Quay Walker makes the tackle. This would be an overtime game at Kansas City. What about sneaking up on him? Without Tannehill. Douglas makes the play. Second interception of the season for Douglas. Tark out. Kevin Strong comes in to play that position at least for one play. And from the 24-yard line now it's first and 20. Rodgers on the run. Boy, he's looking. That one wasn't picked. Off the hands of Joshua Kalou. Had a nice night tonight. Second down and 20. He really has. You know, they wondered if Elijah Molden might be able to go. He couldn't. So Kalou, who's more physical, but shows what he can do in coverage. You know, Rodgers showing the athletic ability to keep that play alive. He was trying to get the ball thrown to Lazard. Just not able to get it enough on him. There's Shane Bowen, who has the defense right now, trying to lock in and put pressure on 12. He's missing Imani Hooker, missing Elijah Molden. Two starters tonight. Hanging in against Rodgers. Two throws. Caught up at the 31-yard line. Randall Cobb. That's where his forward progress stops. Randall Cobb tonight. And his return. Missing four games. Five targets. Five catchers. Weaver actually got free. Looked like he'd be able to get some pressure. But this again goes back to the mechanics of Aaron Rodgers. He can fall back, create that strength and that throw from the ground up with his core and his hips. So he can fall back and deliver a dart for positive yards. Give him a chance here and see what they can do on third down. Third and 12. Nine and a half to go. Steps up. Downfield. Ooh, an incomplete. and that time Sammy Watkins it's the first time he's looked his way tonight and not even close fourth down yeah he had him open on that crosser again he does such a good job as well as anybody of just a feel in the pocket everything you'd want to see again Tennessee does not blitz rush the floor he steps up look in the back I mean it's there Watkins on the crosser is open throw usually you'd expect to see Rodgers make. O'Donnell's kick. Fair catch cold for. And then backing away from his board. And it rolls to a stop at the 13-yard line with 9-13 left in regulation. Tightens up. From the 13-yard line. Tannehill begins this drive. going for 282 tonight here's Henry that's in the 19 yard line he goes to Henry tonight again the workhorse typical night for him in terms of yards in terms of carries with 25 but not in terms of yards only 79 meanwhile now you got Darnell Savage who needs the attention of the training staff well they take a look at Savage let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS and Ryan Tannehill I'm not going to jinx him this time out I promise you can see the night that he's had he's going to act like it's a ho-hum performance 21 and 26 282-2 in the interception but he has been in sync with his receivers. Again, we talked about that right ankle, but he's throwing the ball with confidence, and Todd Downing putting him into place on these early downs of more play-action passes where he could get into that rhythm. So Savage walked off. Meanwhile, Quay Walker is still down. Now he will walk off. As you make your first visit, you actually did a pregame show outside Lambeau when we got in? Yeah. Yeah, we did a college game. It feels like that. It does. The tailgating, the buzz, the air. Yeah, I mean, it's. Yep. I know we always romanticize this place, but you know, you've got here and it's. And the renovation that they did years ago, that's next level. Very cool. Meanwhile, second down and four after the two injured Packers come back to the sideline out for at least one play each. Give it to Henry. And Henry is going to be stopped short of the first down. Less than eight and a half to play. It'll be third down and one. Joe Barry came in with a plan, and he's sticking to it. And I don't blame him. Covering up those offensive linemen. Using four big defensive linemen. The backers walked up. Putting a middle linebacker in by himself. But Green Bay is going to take a timeout. Take that timeout early here. Trying to stop him on this drive. Looking up at the clock. It's going to be second down and nine. Stink back. We keep talking about it. A lot of people talked about when you lose an offensive coordinator and a quarterback coach and Devontae Adams and just so many big pieces that were around this offense. It takes time sometimes to find that new rhythm and that new chemistry and take a look. I mean, look at this. Look at what they had and take all those pieces from 21 when they were as good of offense as there was in the league and they all went off to new opportunities. A couple of coaches as well. Hackett, the head coach now at Denver. Get you over in Chicago. Coordinator. Second down and nine here at the 39-yard line. Henry to the 43. So, Henry tonight. 86 yards, 28 carries. longest run for him tonight nine yards they built their defense to stop him and when you do that you're going to give up somewhere you're going to give up potentially somewhere else in defense and that's where Tannehill in the passing game has been effective enough go back to Rodgers they got it to 20-17 they don't have a first down in their last three drives they've been within striking distance they've had a chance to have the ball Three straight drives, no first downs. He saw his numbers tonight. He's taken snaps directly from center, thrown two passes, including a touchdown pass. So the graphic bet, only Walter Payton has done those things. Walter Payton was one of the few guys who could do those things. So Green Bay, after taking its second time out, third down and five. Low snap. Tannehill. And a big sack just when Green Bay needed it. Preston Smith with the sack. Well, he's been working on the edge really all night and being able to get after Dennis Daly. Taylor LeJuan is out for the year, so Daly is pressed in, and he knows the potential. Remember, Preston Smith is known for his power rush. He uses power there, but still gets to the corner, shows enough athletic ability to close in on Tannehill there on that third down. And the Packers have taken their final timeout, which is a little odd here, to take all of your timeouts. Granted, you want to get as much time on the clock as you can to do all the things you need to do down by 10, but I don't think I've seen a team take all of its timeouts in this particular season. putting all the chips in the middle. They're basically saying they're going to have to score, obviously, right here. Well, there's a guy who doesn't need timeouts to score. You're looking at him. He's got to play a little bit better than he's played to this point tonight. Just when the crowd's ready to boo the offense, like of an eye, they score a touchdown. Back they come. So Stonehouse now with his third boot. We'll get some flurries here for the first time in a couple of hours. A lot of hang time on this baby. Caught at the 8. And able to take this one back to the 18-yard line goes Keyshawn Nixon. With .454 to go after a 57-yard punt. So we were with Rodgers yesterday. He's become very, how do we describe it? Contemplative? Would it be a word to put it this year, Aaron? You know, very full of... You know, when we walked in yesterday, I felt like I was sitting at the feet of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. At one point. I think he was enjoying the conversation. He does. He likes a lot of give and take. Yeah, it was great. Of course, we've known him for years. Had 50 meetings with him. I agree. He always has a lot of interesting stuff to say. But we'll see what he can pull out of his hat here. Over the middle. Starts with a pass. Caught. And close to a first down is Robert Tunyon. Wants to put the ball down, hands it to the ref, says, come on, let's go, let's get up to the line. Save as much time as we can. Second down and one. Tennessee keeping it two safeties back, trying to avoid that big play. To the outside. That's caught. That's on the first to Lazard. No, incomplete. Lazard juggled. Went to work on Lazard with Avery covering to put the rookie on him. Use his power, push Runyon back, and there's David Long to clean it up. 51. Well, no measure, but Mike Brable's reaction tells you all you need to know. And so does Aaron Rodgers. So they can run one play before the two-minute warning and then pretty much take the rest of the time off the clock. Might have to give it up at one point, but good luck to the Packers to try to get two scores. And Simmons with the sack, and then they challenge him. They run right at him on fourth and short. And he steps up, pushing Runyon back. Look at David Long coming down in a hurry. The safety, Adams. How fitting for this game to be decided and clinched for the Tennessee. Kind of a tough-minded attitude, culture team. Fourth and short, Brable's got to be fired up, not just about to win, but getting that stop on fourth down. And while you were out in the kitchen, the Tennessee Titans have won seven of their last eight games. They only lost in overtime. You know what? They're a tough matchup because of the style of football that they play. You get into November, December, line of scrimmage football on both sides of the ball travels. If they can keep Tannehill healthy and in a good place, they're going to be tough. Well, play action. Last play before the two-minute warning. You might as well go deep, and you might as well go to your rookie receiver, Burks. And that sets up a first and goal at the five-yard line. 51 points. And that takes us to the two-minute warning. Again, kind of symbolic of what they've done tonight. The way they've moved the ball is not Derrick Henry running, but it's been some gadgets and some wrinkles. This time, of all people, you're going to go after Jair Alexander, who's probably sleeping on the play. He's not expecting that, right? The rookie's going to go by him. What a throw and what a catch. The thing, if we're all over, they're going to run it. Two-minute warning. Run a couple more plays. Maybe punt with a few seconds left. Instead, you know, when you think about it, that's really a brilliant play. Because who in the world is thinking you're going to throw? No chance. Throw long on a play like that. And he's taking a lot of heat, too. The offensive coordinator. Todd Downing deserves a lot of credit, doesn't he? I mean, tonight was great. A lot of direct snaps to Henry. Two passes from Henry. And for Aaron Rodgers, well. But he'll have some interesting comments, I'm sure, after the game. Reflecting on this one. Meanwhile, schedule is coming up. Tennessee goes home, plays Cincinnati. Then they go to Philadelphia. Jacksonville and the Chargers and Houston. Meanwhile, Green Bay goes to Philadelphia on a Sunday night. In ten days, in that Chicago, a bye, a late bye for them. Rams come in. And here on a Monday night would look to be one of the great games of the year. But now you tell me. And then at Miami. Remember the Cincinnati game last year. That playoff game that Tennessee lost at home against Joe Burrow. Who ended up getting to the Super Bowl obviously. But Tannehill took that one personally. They get a chance to get back at Cincinnati. You know what? This is going to ruin one of the great streaks in NFL history. First and goal. Oh my gosh. Right? Think about it. They should have an asterisk in it though. This doesn't count. No, no. You're right. And there's another thing that doesn't count because we're already over that right now. I got you. You don't know what I'm talking about. But the fact that they have scored on first and goal for the last almost full calendar year, and I haven't stopped here, and they'll just run out the clock with one more kneel down, and that will take us to the postgame show. Meanwhile, the Shanks, thanks. You have a great holiday. And you too. I'll see you soon. Yeah. We saw the turkeys. We didn't see the ducks or the chickens. But if Man Madden was still around, they'd be in trouble too. What a win for Braves on the road here at Lambeau. So they come north And Aaron Rodgers Offering his congratulations To the Titans And I'm sure he'll see his Long time buddy Mr. Vrabel, there's Dylan and Henry right there As well Mr. Tannehill tonight 200 Or make it 300 At 333 yards Two touchdowns So, Tennessee keeps rolling in for Green Bay. Back in the doldrums. Don't let him run free. Play action. Rolls out and takes a shot. Boy, oh boy. Chris Barnes levels him short of the first down. And he'll help to his feet. Flips the ball away, but in comes the punt unit. Now I'm with you. I mean, this is a heck of an effort by Tannehill to try to get there, but what a play. Are you kidding me? By Chris Barnes. And Chris Barnes had a concussion. He missed last week. He comes in lightning quick. And without that acceleration, Tannehill gets that first down. So meanwhile, Stonehouse comes in, who's had a fantastic year, second punt of the night. Stonehouse undrafted out of Colorado State. I said to him before the game, how are you undrafted? Altitude? They thought it was the altitude. He said, yeah, but he said, I kicked a lot at sea level as well. Short kick, fielded at the 32 on a hop. Keyshawn Nixon gets free into Tennessee territory and runs it back all the way to the 42-yard line. And Stonehouse knocks him out of bounds at that spot. So often on those big returns, a guy loses his lane. And the ball bounces. He gets to the outside and shows that speed. To discover all of the, I don't want to say crazy, but the different folk. Best starting field position for Green Bay tonight from the 44-yard line to the outside. Jones makes the catch. He gets rolled down at the 41-yard line. Injury update. Let's go to Kaylee. Al, the Titans secondary that's already been hit by so many injuries this season now has cornered Christian Fulton questionable return to this game with a hamstring injury. He's had a lingering hamstring issue through the season. He missed weeks two and three. He was out of last Sunday's game as well and on the injury report all week. Yeah, well, we started the game by talking about all the guys that are missing up front. Got Simmons back tonight. Puts Trey Avery into the game, who's a rookie. I think Rogers might understand that little flip here. Jones again, they went basically the same play and come up about three or four yards shy. Well, first down as we tick down to six minutes to go in regulation. This guy, David Long, is a baller. You know, he's kind of had to wait his turn. Rashawn Evans, John Brown move on, and he steps up. When he's healthy, he is emotional spark plug. at 5'11", 227 in his fourth year out of West Virginia. Really become the leader of that front. He's been active tonight. Getting down to that point in the game where every third down assumes more importance. Third and three here. Rodgers. Deep drop. Over the middle. Too high for Alan Lazard. Mauro Edwards forcing the issue in the pocket. Fourth down, and the offense right now is going to stay out there. They're going to have to go for it at this point. Boy, just misses Lazard. Does a good job of getting vertical and then working across against McCreary. Everything just the way Aaron Rodgers would like. The ball is just a little high there. That's an easy first down. surprised they haven't tried Avery 30 to the left just to try to create a matchup against a young defender hadn't been playing much free agent rookie out of Rutgers Rodgers deep down the left sideline and nothing happening there Lazard covered by Avery and this crowd is not used to performances like this I think they're reacting because because Lazard, there's Avery, by the way, that's who they went after. You'd think that they would be on the same page. It's a veteran receiver in that slot going to the fade, but just kind of gives up on the route. I think Aaron Rodgers is expecting him to go downfield. That's why he's shrugging his shoulders saying, what are we doing here? We've seen a lot of that this year with Aaron Rodgers and his receivers reading things differently, not being on the same page. That's why everybody was hoping after last week against Dallas, coming back from 28-14. He ends up hitting Watson, and maybe that could be the spark that this offense needed to find that rhythm. They were hoping it was a trampoline. Instead, it might be an aberration. Down by 10, Tennessee has the ball. 5.21 to go in the fourth. And Henry can start using some of the clock here as well. Aaron says, let's huddle up third and long. Watch Avery. This is the guy I said they might try to challenge. That's a catch. What you saw, and then Avery's hand gets in there. Doesn't complete the process of the catch. Nice job of knocking that ball loose. That's close. Out of timeouts. Cannot challenge. Third and one. A good point, too, that losing those timeouts as well, you cannot challenge. Third and one. Rodgers outside, wide open Watson makes the catch, folding down as he does Holds on And the play was stopped Was it stopped inbounds? No, he did get out To stop the clock with 425 Took everything he had Remember he did the backflip last week after a touchdown I thought he was going to do that to get out of bounds From the 36 Swings it out. Jones. The Titans will give them all the dribs and drabs they want. Short gain. Braves and Shane Bowen keeping their defense, just sinking back in zone. Seven guys, eyes on the quarterback, nothing downfield, everything in front of them. second and ten over the middle into traffic and that's incomplete trying to get into Sammy Watkins again Avery they're gonna work on Avery but so far so good for him Sammy Knight here been around for a while came most recently with Baltimore Titans right now because of these injuries they're rolling a lot of different faces into that secondary Trey Avery back there the rookie out of Rutgers Maven back there 32 off the practice That's why today he came. One man rush again. Rodgers over the middle. And that's caught. And that's just what they needed here. They needed 11 yards and got it to Lazard. And the clock will roll down under four minutes. At that time, they're able to have that connection. Good job attacking the middle. I know it keeps the clock moving, but a good chunk play there for positive yards. On the third and long, too. Meanwhile, that's stuffed after a minimal game by David Long. After Randall Cobb makes his sixth catch of the night. Again, I don't know if there's anybody who embodies the attitude of Vrabel and Bowen better than David Long and the way he plays. Plays with kind of a chip on his shoulder, a nastiness that you love to see from those linebackers. Second down is seven. From the 50, Rodgers stepping away, looking. Down he goes. secondary doing its work receivers couldn't get open and finally Jeffrey Simmons that we talked about who was a game time decision as to whether he play or not makes his presence felt really for the first time tonight and watch this is great coverage downfield but watch when Rogers starts to say okay where am I going to go he starts to scramble nobody working with him not one receiver everybody's downfield so eventually your guy Simmons is able to clean it up but that was great coverage downfield, and really a poor job by the receivers of adjusting to a scrambling quarterback. 12-yard sack, third down and 19. Rodgers stepping away. Fires, and that's going to be caught, and he goes to Watson. He's right on the line. Did he get the first down or not? He's close. Going to mark it apparently a little bit short, and they do just outside the 44th, so now you have a fourth down and one. Can they keep it alive? Jones! With a naked eye, does it, that second thrust, does it do it? No, it didn't look like he ever got there. And if they put it down at that spot, the Tennessee Titans will be flying home with a victory. They went right at Jeffrey Simmons, who, as you said, has had a quiet night. But here he is right here eating up blocks, allowing the rest of these backers, David Long and company, to get downhill. Well, you talk about holding your point. Look at Simmons' extension.
