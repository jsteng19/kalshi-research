 Coming up right after this. And back deep is Chris Evans to receive the kickoff. Jason Sanders has been their kicker for five seasons now, one of the best in the league. And he will get us started as we begin week number four of the 2022 NFL season. and we begin on this 60-degree night with a touchback. Joe Burrow. His numbers this season, very rocky start for him. Six TDs and four interceptions. The rating is well below the league average, and he's been sacked 15 times already with a revamped offensive line that still has a lot of work to do. Bengals come off two losses at the gun in weeks one and two And then a victory last week in the Meadowlands over the Jets And they start on the ground and they start with Mixon Picking up a couple up to the 27-yard line He goes second down Zach Taylor is in his third year as the head coach here He was on the Miami staff a number of years ago under Joe Philbin spent one season at the University of Cincinnati then went to Sean McVay with the Rams and got the job and he started out very slowly with only six wins in two years but last year of course he was on the sidelines in the Super Bowl second and eight Burrow's first pass of the night on target a little short of the first down Jamar Chase pulls it in and they will spot the ball at the 34 yard line Third down and one. This is one of the answers with an offensive line that is struggling to take care of their quarterback, already allowing the 15 sacks. Get the ball out fast. Matchup that Jamar Chase obviously is going to win. Easy throw to settle Joe Burrow into the game against a young corner. Now you give yourself a chance here at third and short. They go three wide. Stack to the right side. Come up in the gun. A lot of motion here. That's Tiggins, the movement man. and the pass is caught, and that's a first down. So they pick up a third and one and pick up a lot more out to the 46-yard line of Miami. That is Hayden Hurst, the tight end. The game of 19. Al Higgins going in motion and has an out cut, holds on to Howard, the corner, and then it creates that opening over the middle there on third and short. This is what Bengal fans have been waiting to see from Hurst. Big athletic tight end making plays and making it tough on the defense to bring him down after the catch. Got away from a Brandon Jones would-be tackle. Spotted with the 47 of the Dolphins. Quick pass. Left side. Nice move by Higgins, who scored two touchdowns in the Super Bowl, and he picks up a first down. Well, again, this is the game within the game is Miami's defensive coordinator, Josh Boyer. It's in their DNA. It's who they are. It's what they did last week to Josh Allen. They're aggressive. They blitz. Nice job by Joe Burrow. Seeing an easy throw to the bottom there to Tee Higgins. Quick throw and a quick first down. Go no huddle here. They've worked on Xavier Howard twice now. Back to the ground they go. Keeping those legs churning but only for a two-yard game goes Joe Mixon. Second down and eight. Mixon off to a slow start. They're trying to get him on track tonight. Only averaged a little under three yards of carry on the year. And there is Mike McDaniel. Comes over from the San Francisco staff, most recently under Kyle Shanahan. Started with Mike Shanahan as an intern back in 05 at Denver. A surprising choice to head him up, but here he is at 3-0. He and Nick Sirianni, the only unbeaten coaches in the league right now. Yeah, and what a personality, right? I think the league is going to fall in love with him, and I know his team already has. Play action. Checks it down underneath. Hurst again. and he gets tackled a couple of yards shy. The first down and the flag comes in. Peter Coho, number 28, is there as the flag came in at the end of the play. Looked like Keon Cross and came in there a little bit late after Hurst was already down. Hit him late, beat 15 more yards on top of this. Personal foul. I'm not concerned about roughness. Late hit. Deacon on the 27th. Trinity is half a distance to the ball. Automatic first down. Trayv Lake, first-year referee, making the call. and that will mark them into the red zone. Doesn't it remind you of last week's opening drive against the Jets? This is an offense that really was sluggish in their first two weeks, early against Pittsburgh. Anaheim, right? That's right. With Mike in 0-5. This is Washington. Burrow throws, and that pass is incomplete. It'll be third down and five. It's so funny. You know, we talked about the fact they went after Brady. illegally. Watson's in the mix, and they try to get Sean Payton as well. Yeah. Right? At least talk to his agent. So you don't get any of them, and you wind up with McDaniel and Tua, and you're 3-0. It's incredible. It's one of the great stories in the first month of the NFL season, and everybody you talk to, they all point to not just the XOs, but what he's brought as far as where they were the last couple years, and where they are now, and how different it is with the energy and the belief. And he loves to have fun. Third and five. To the outside. That pass is short and incomplete. Tried to get that to T. Higgins. And Miami will get the ball back. Loved his line about his job as a head coach is to serve others and to help others become the best that they can be. It sounds like a simple concept, but just something that I think players really will rally around. Through wins, it's easy at 3-0. But I also think through wins and losses. With the ale majored in history. Hill is back there again to field the punt but it bounces back toward the Bengals' side and is down to the 41-yard line. Very short kick there. And Miami takes over near midfield. 29-yard boot. On a 59-degree night. Through skies. Look around the capacity crowd at Hancor Stadium. used to be Paul Brown. Mike Brown owns the team. His father was Paul Brown. It was a hard thing to have to come to grips with but in today's world, Moolah talks so you can sell the naming rights. To a back. Going deep. Downfield for Hill. And it's almost picked here. A flag is down. Jesse Bates covering on the plane. Two fags in the offensive backfield. They hit him low as he threw the football. Number two, a dealing with a back and ankle. coming into this game. Many people didn't know if he would play. Rough in the past. Defense, number 58. 15-yard penalty. Automatic first down. Joseph Osai. Osai, the second-year man out of Texas, was out all last year. Essentially a rookie. He missed all of last year. Has some quickness. Doesn't give up on the play, but comes in low right as he releases the ball. Yeah. Caught the attention. Of the officials. Yeah, he was on the report not only with the back and he passed the concussion protocol. It's still being looked at by the league even though they said everything was cool to this point. But he was also on there with an ankle as well. That's right. First down, 43-yard line. One point game. Six and a half to go in the half. Raheem Mostert to the 40-yard line. He goes. Lou Anaromo a guy who came into more prominence of course when you go to the Super Bowl you come into prominence but a guy who has made some tremendous adjustments at halftime to win in that game against Kansas City in the FC Championship game and he came from behind after being down 18 points that's really one of the things he's known for his players we'll talk about that in fact we sat with Mike Hilton that's the thing he admires most his ability to make adjustments at halftime to a rolling left with the grain and down he goes slung down in his own 48 yard line Josh Tupu and uh oh well we saw last week and he went down he got up, was wobbly the training staff comes out and of course the last thing the Dolphins wanted to see Last week it looked for all the world. Everybody thought head injury, concussion, passed the protocol, came back second half, led him to a victory. And Al Tupo slams him to the ground. I mean, you're thinking about the back, the ankle, but he gets thrown to the ground. Again, wrenching that back, which was the issue last week. So they work on him. We'll step away for a moment. not going to speculate but Tungabailoa is still down as they work on him and we'll show you in a moment the way his fingers were stretching out at the end of that play comes down on his elbow, comes down on his back comes down on the back of his head eight touchdowns, two interceptions Terrence's terrific rating, second in the league coming into this game right now. This guy looked like a different quarterback from the first two years in Miami where a lot of people are questioning if he's the guy, is he the answer to at least the first three games in this new system. Throwing in great rhythm, great timing with his receivers. Raheem Mostert starts at running back. and the one-time 49er now with his seventh team, and actually his second stint with Miami. Starts with a seven-yard gain, second down and three. And they will run that football to set up their play-action pass. Mike McDaniel has brought in, you know, everybody expects him to run the Kyle Shanahan offense, and you'll see a slight difference. I mean, Tua, who's very, very more experienced and comfortable in the shotgun, but he does have an ability, continues to get more and more comfortable under center. But they'll mix it up quite a bit in the gun. As he put it to us the other day, a lot more comfortable right now than he was the last two years. Play action. Fires over the middle. On target. That's Hill. Tyreek Hill, biggest trade of the offseason. Kansas City to Miami for a ton of draft choices. Jesse Bates makes the tackle to gain a 25. The play action is going to impact the backers. The backers come up. To his feet are critical here because he knows as soon as he comes off play action, foot in the ground, ball is out. So he's made it very clear. Mike McDaniels made it very clear to the receivers. Be at the right depth. And when I put my foot in the ground, if you're where you're supposed to be, the ball is coming to you. Hill taken out of the game last week by the Jets. Picked up only two catches. And meanwhile, they go to Jalen Waddle. And what a one-two combination this is. When you've got Tyreek Hill and Jalen Waddell, you have a ton. Oh, yeah. And here you have Ingold, who's going to come in motion and go down this sideline. You go down the sideline, you're going to impact, put a player in conflict. The corner doesn't know, should he wait outside or go to the inside where the speed is with Waddell? He sits to the outside because of that motion by Ingold, has to respect it, and it creates another big opening in the middle of that defense. Three plays, two passes. First down from the 22-yard line. Shurfield is the man in motion, and that's deflected and incomplete. Second down and 10, B.J. Hill got his hand on it. B.J. Reeder out of the lineup, one of the better run stuffers in the NFL. He'll have a mixed bag, but B.J. Hill, his stock has to go up. He's got to make plays now in the interior. One of the ways you can make a play against Tua, where the ball is out fast is to be able to time it up and get your hand up and knock the ball down. Tua averages 2.5 seconds. That's seventh in the NFL as far as getting the ball out and as quickly as he does. On second and ten, the only left-handed quarterback in the league picks up a first down here. Trent Shurfield, who was the recipient, in a manner of speaking, of the butt punt the other day, makes the catch here. Yeah, and Tua talked about the relationship that he has with him. You know, there's so much action going on. He's got his eyes right here on the edge of that defense. Comes down, he can either throw it out into the flat quickly to Tyreek Hill or go downfield where he decides to go to Trent Shurfield. So there's a lot to be able to get ready for as a defense because of how quickly they attack, the pre-snap motions. They put a lot of players in conflict here, especially on the edges. Well, look, that's something in his eye. Now on the end of the round, here goes Tyreek Hill, and they bottle him up at the line of scrimmage. The Kansas City Chiefs, six years in the league, been to six Pro Bowls. Sam Hubbard makes the tackle there, second down and 11. Hubbard does a heck of a job. He is known with a guy that has a relentless motor. Watch him fight through 30. Engel gets through there, sheds that block, inherits another guy, gets off of him, and then eventually is able to make the play. So Mostert started. Now Chase Edmonds comes in at running back. And they put him in the slot to the right side. Tua throws over the middle. And that is caught at the five-yard line. And that is Chase Edmonds. Spent four years with the Cardinals. Picked him up as a free agent. A lot of movement in the offseason by the Dolphins. Picked up some major stars, of course, starting with Hill. But Edmonds comes in and they hope to have him as the starting running back. even though most of it started tonight. Yeah, everybody thinks about Hill and Waddle matching up against the corners, but you've got to deal with the tight ends and the backs. And this time, Edmonds against Pratt, a mismatch and good identification, but it does set up a big third down here. Eighth play of the drive. He's the calming influence of this team. He knows how to conduct himself in this situation. He's been there. He's been through his own scary injuries. McDaniel said the best thing that he can do now is get a win for Tua because that's what he wants. Yeah, for sure. He was worried at knee injury a number of years ago. Mostert to run it back to the 24-yard line to his parents, Kaylee mentioned, from Hawaii. At the St. Louis High School in Honolulu. The same school that produced Marcus Mariota. And the folks are here tonight and obviously at the hospital right now. Yeah. Everybody who's ever been around to anybody watching this game, obviously our thoughts are with him. We all go back to last week when he had that hit, wondered if he'd be okay. Kind of gutted it out just to get on the field tonight, and then he has this happen. So we'll see what Teddy can do to finish it. Little toss here, and tripped up in the backfield is Edmonds, who scored that touchdown in the waning seconds. Mike Hilton stopping him there. It'll be second down and 10. Mike Hilton is walked up. You know, sometimes he'll sit back with two safeties, but this time they walk him up right here. He's able to just get around the edge before Ingold or the tight end could pick him up. It was Durham Smythe trying to get out there to him. But, boy, one of the better slot corners you'll find in the NFL does everything for this Bengals defense. Second and ten. Flag is thrown because there was a false start. On the left side of the line. False start. All-time. Number 72. Teron Armstead. Second air. So now Armstead becomes the guy protecting the blind side. Yeah. With Bridgewater the right-handed quarterback. That's right. We talked earlier about that match with Trey Hendrickson, them playing together in New Orleans. Very familiar with one another. The moves that they have. gets a little different now with Teddy Bridgewater in there as a right-handed thrower. Play clock at one. Bridgewater, deep drop, deep throw, and the Bengals are back there with Eli Apple, but he is out of bounds. So Apple and, of course, Hill were going at it back and forth, Mainly Hill this week. Yeah. Apple steps out. This time. Yeah, he's covering Shurfield. Shurfield, the right foot unable to get down. He wants that matchup as much as Tyreek Hill wants that. Boy, that right foot, as he caught the ball, he did everything in his power to try to keep it down. Easily got the left foot down, but it was about that right foot. Third and 15. Hill on Apple this time. Glitch coming from the corner. They pick it up. Pass is tip and complete. That's a Wougier that time. And a pass intended for River Craycraft. Fourth out. It's a tough matchup against a Wougier. Wougier, again, is one of the top corners. Leads to the start of 2022. Just a technician. Has size. Craig Craft does have size on him, but quickly you see Uziah gets his head turned. That ball was actually thrown behind him as well. River Craig Craft, one of the great names in the National Football League. Fair catch ball forward to 36-yard line by Trent Taylor. And that's where the Bengals were tonight. Chase has caught just one for eight yards very early on. From the 36. 6. Burrow, good protection, slings it to the outside, and that's close to a first down for T. Higgins. Josh Boyer, the defensive coordinator for Miami, one of the plans he had tonight was to try to disrupt the timing with Jamar Chase and his receivers. And Joe Burrow, it's worked for the most part. They've been jamming him, trying to hold him up at the line, give that defensive line time to get to the quarterback. One time Howard tried to do that, saw T. Higgins go right by him. They have been challenging Howard, the pro bowler, throughout this night. But one of the plans that's been working is trying to jam them up with that tight-pressed man. Spotted it at the 44. Second down and two. Back to the ground. Not much happening for Mixon tonight, though he should have the first down here. Mixon coming into the game averaging less than three yards a carry. And tonight he's averaging less than three yards a carry. 14 for 40. Yeah, early in the game it looked like he might get on track. They've been trying to throw the ball to him. Just any chance at all. In the pocket, under pressure, takes off again, and is stopped a little bit short of the first down. Needham and Jerome Baker were there to create a fourth down here, and let's see what the call is going to be from the Bengals bench and Zach Taylor. How in the world did he get away from that pressure? I mean, Phillips got in there in a heartbeat, but somehow he sidesteps that and picks up some positive yards. I loved his line about, I said, man, you're getting hit a lot again this year. And he said, yeah, but it's disrespectful to the game of football if you don't get hit. I've never heard that from anybody. Especially a quarterback. Mixing in. He'll go for it on a fourth down and one. A little toss to Joe to the outside. He goes, and he will not get it. And that Dolphin defense stiffens. Eric Rowe was there. he makes the tackle and Miami will take over with ten and a half to go in the first half and the Bengals up by four the ball back after a great stop by their defense see if they go back to those short quick passes where the ball was getting out and he was finding some openings into the middle of that defense mixing in a little bit of the run game and a play action I've seen Tyreek Hill and Eli Apple. Can't wait to see when they go one-on-one tonight. A little verbal jousting. Social media action. A lot of talking going on. Mainly from Tyreek. Edmonds is the running back here. Faked to him. And then that's almost picked off there. Intended for a waddle and a flag. Yeah, waddle wasn't even looking for the football. Ousier almost was able to pick that off. Walked to the end zone. Just not on the same page there. And that was a receiver downfield. Offense, number 68. Five-yard penalty, first down. So Robert Hunt, outstanding right guard. Played every snap last season. He was five yards downfield. After the throw, you see Tua talking to Waddle to try to get the two on the same page. Waddle, as I said, never even looked for it. Get alignment, five yards downfield. We've not seen this from Miami in the first three weeks. You know, some miscues and hurting themselves. Up the middle. 2-23 goes Chase Edmonds. Makes it second down and 11. Found it interesting on our Zoom with Tua when he talked about being empowered with his coaching staff. how hard he's been on himself throughout his life. His dad was tough on him, his high school coach. Nick Saban was tough on him. He said Mike's created kind of a safe place where he's playing free. Not robots, just kind of accepting mistakes and learning from them. Yeah, his dad was so tough, he sent him to Alabama instead of USC where Tua wanted to go. That's right. Second and 11, that pass over the middle. There is Hill. And the Cheetah, as he calls himself, takes it up to the 40-yard line. And the motion there by Shurfield, again, a catch is the eyes of the linebackers and creates a nice passing lane. It's a good matchup with Tyreek Hill against Owousie. Into the middle, linebackers had cleared out, easy throw. And again, Tua, a little step, a little hop, throw, and a first down. Hill has been targeted four times, has caught three for 46 yards. first down from the 40 Edmonds to the outside and can barely get around the corner before he is taken down he was right in the middle of that picture as well second and long I don't know if Logan Wilson 55 gets the attention that he deserves he is a linebacker that's known for his ability to cover but you watch him you watch how active he is he did not hesitate with all that jet motion He's able to get out there and run sideline to sideline, and he is a physical inside linebacker. They don't take him off the field. It's rare to see a middle linebacker that plays on first down, second down, and third down, but he has that kind of skill set. It allows him to do it. And rare to see seven interceptions in 29 games for a linebacker, two more than any other guy since that period of time, as Hilton makes the catch and is taken out of bounds in front of the Cincinnati bench. Third and three. That's just Tua recognizing he had a couple receivers tied in. Just any time you can get the ball to Tyree Kill and you've got a couple blockers, you've got a little bit of space, you take your chances. Really, that play is to set up this play now on third and fourth. Put it back. Bengals on top, 7-6. And Burrow begins to strike with a handoff to Nixon. And Nixon has now carried 13 times. but for only 37 yards. The first time we have called Christian Wilkins' name, 94 just shoots a gap right here. He is a talented, big defensive lineman who just gets better and better with the more experience that he gains. Fourth-year player out of Clemson. Brings great twitch, quickness to the inside to go along with that power and size. Under four minutes to go in the half. Second attack. Burrows slings it to the outside. Nothing happening there. Nixon makes the catch. Crowd is getting a little impatient here. Duke Rodley makes the stop third and 11. That opening drive that Cincinnati had with Zach Taylor, I just felt it was aggressive. It was decisive. They were kind of in that attack mode. Since then, Miami, to their credits, made some adjustments, but Zach Taylor in this offense and Joe Burrow unable to really get their rhythm back that they had early in this game. P. Ryan now in the backfield. Chase has only one catch for eight yards. Burrow is 8 of 15, barely over 50%. Goes deep down the left sideline and that's caught. That's T. Higgins to the end zone. So the crowd was growing impatient. The next thing you know, you got a 59-yard touchdown over Xavier Howard's head. Interesting decision here by Miami. Look at their safeties concerned about the right side. Their bodies turned. They think the ball is going to chase. Instead, it creates a one-on-one opportunity. They think that one of the best corners in the league, Howard, can hold up against Higgins. They want to help out on the other side. So they leave Howard alone, and a good throw. Great job by Higgins with the catch radius to come back to that ball, but he gets a round Howard for that touchdown. And no fear picking on Howard tonight. Extra point is good. So on third and 11 for 59 yards, it is 14 to 6, and now we're back in 30 seconds. I have it all of a sudden the explosive play Higgins who had two touchdowns in the Super Bowl on the receiving end of this one and good job Joe Burrow recognized right away that the safeties were more concerned about Boyd and Chase to the other side with inexperienced corners they trusted Howard to be able to hold up Joe Burrow said you know what we can win with anybody Howard's a great player but we're going to go to T. Higgins we think he can win one-on-one and he did. Mostert back there and he lets it down through the end zone. So now Bridgewater, and it's his game now obviously, comes in down by one, starts with a good pass that almost nets a first down. They missed the field goal attempt and now he's down by eight. Because of that experience you'd just like to see Mike McDaniel who is a head coach and a first time play caller. How much does he trust Teddy Bridgewater in this offense on the road. And I think because of all that experience that he has, he's going to have to and continue to try to be aggressive. With a play clock here. Getting off with three. And the handoff here goes to Mostert. I've been impressed with Cincinnati in the middle. You take DJ Reader out of the middle of that defense, and you wonder how they're going to hold up against a Miami team that can move people pretty well, especially the interior. That's the strength of the Dolphins' offensive line, the middle three. But you're seeing a pretty good job of holding the point. B.J. Hill, 92, who's got to take over. Look at him get extension with those hands. Allows those linebackers to get downhill with Pratt and Wilson. Toss here. Mostert. to the 31-yard line, and that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. We'll hold everything right now, as Lee Corso would say. Just hang on for a second, not so fast. Flag down. It's the body slam, I think, late after the whistle. The Bengals could have given up on the play, but instead they picked the ball carrier up and slammed him to the ground. That's where the flag at least came in. It'll be a big break for Miami if that's the call. personal foul, unnecessary roughness, defense I get the 46 yard line, have to get to the 50 with a little over 8 to play in the opening half Tua empties the backfield, 4 man rush fires downfield for Hill and he can't one hand it But a flag comes in to Wugier with the coverage on the play. Wugier, rare mistake, doesn't put himself in position to find the football. Head never turned around. Hands get on Tyree Kill. And I think that's what they probably see. Watch his head. Never gets a turnaround. Now you're playing catch-up against that speed. And then he grabs him. Two balls in the play, both by the defense. A little contact, hands to the face. Defense. That penalty is declined. Pass interference. Defense, number 22. The ball replaced at the front of the foul. Automatic first down. Yeah, hands to the face, only five yards. That's an automatic first and a lot further downfield as it takes it to the 30-yard line. That's the risk you take. At some point, you've got to leave your corners out there on islands and hope that they can hold up against this speed. That's the danger of defending Miami. It's not just Tyreek Hill. You've got Jalen Waddle on the other side. You're dealing with two of the fastest guys in the league on one offense. You're a defensive back. That's not a pretty sight when he'll get behind you. From the 30. The run pass option and the pass is incomplete intended for. You know about the big playability, but they're blocking. And how unselfish they are and how they practice was very cool to see. the ball comes out did he make the catch? he did not that's Akeem Davis Gaither who's there covering on Waddle who could not fold in which benefits him, he's just incomplete Davis Gaither just reads the eyes there, that is a tough thing to do for a big linebacker to get into the middle where there's space against Waddle but he's got long arms he never gave up on the play one swaddle went down it looked like a catch Watch that left hand rip at the ball as he goes down to pull it out Third and ten. Deep drop. Tua scrambles away. Goes for the end zone and incomplete. Tyreek Hill was there and so were about four Bengals. And it's fourth down. Tua tried to buy some time there but that Bengal pass rush they didn't quite get to him but they made him get rid of that ball he just had nowhere to go he just throws it away he's trying to find Tyreek Hill down the middle so Jason Sanders comes in this will be a 48 yard attempt next gen stats provided by AWS. The make probability here is 61%. And it's now 100%. Two field goals that would have been good from 51. 7-6. The Bengals on. Single mother. He's about 10 years old. Goes to the Denver Broncos training camp in Greeley, Colorado. Loses his hat. The assistant video director comes over, finds a new hat for him, and then he introduces the assistant video director to his mother. They wind up getting married. And then years later, he winds up on Mike Shanahan's staff as an intern in Denver in 2005, and off and running he went. Mike McDaniel with Denver, been with a number of teams, including Miami, spent one season, of course, in college, and I'll tell you what, you see his press conferences? This is a very unique cat. Unbelievable. One-of-a-kind personality, and he's authentic. He's true to who he is, and I think that's why his players love him so much. In three short weeks, this team has fallen in love with his approach and appreciate the way he coaches and his philosophies behind it. A taste of Miami. He's talking to Tua from the plane on the phone as Burrow throws on first down to Mixon, and that's the initial contact. We talked to Tua. He said, I had no idea who this guy was. None. You've got to think about Tua with his background. His college coach, Nick Saban. And now he's dealing with Mike McDaniel. And you could just hear in just that conversation, it's a very different approach. I think he embodies this younger wave of head coaches in the NFL as well as anybody. And it's fun to see and fun to watch. Another pop out of Shepard. That's Hill in the backfield. And two of throws to the end zone, and it's juggled and incomplete. Edmonds had it and then dropped it. Mike Hilton with the coverage on the play, but the ball was right there. Fourth down. But their pre-snap movement again, which we'll be saying a lot of, they moved Edmonds out of the backfield, created some hesitation and doubt. Ball is bobbled. Perfectly thrown ball by Tua. He thought he had the touchdown, but Edmonds unable to hold it. He had him beat, just not able to execute for the touchdown. As Keith Jackson would have said, six points, one of wasting. They'll have to settle for three if Sanders can knock this one through. 23-yard attempt. And they go down the field, but can't cash in for seven. Settled for three. It was 6.05 to go in the opening quarter in Cincinnati. The Bengals lead 7-3. This returns from that fivesome. They rebuild it. Seven sacks were allowed to the Rams. Of course, the one at the end with Aaron Donald clinching it. So they went out. They got Bolson, a rookie out of North Dakota State. Karras came from New England. Kappa comes from Tampa Bay. And Collins, of course, from the Dallas Cowboys. And look at the results so far. as they're still developing chemistry coming into the night, tied for the most sacks at 15. But a great opening drive, and there's a guy that's got a little bit of energy, and we've not seen that in the first three games from Joe Mixon. If you just tuning in, missed that opening drive, the Bengals moved the ball right down the field 75 yards and a touchdown. And while we all want to look at Joe Burrow, anybody would tell you the offensive line. We talked about it in the open. How would they perform? Would they give him time? The group that's playing much better tonight. Nice job on the play side by Leo Collins. We saw Bolson pulling around. And then the toughness, the determination to get the ball into the end zone for a touchdown to finish the opening drive off. Very similar to what the Bucs did, or Kansas City did, what the Bucs did to Kansas City by making Kansas City change their offensive line after that Super Bowl victory over Kansas City. The pass is incomplete here. Intended for Jamar Chasen, we go to Kaylee. Ted Karras told me that his experience as a Dolphins captain in 2020 prepared him to lead this Bengals O-line as one of its four new starters. He didn't want to come into Cincinnati bullish and brutish. When he joined the team this spring, he told me he observed what's made this culture successful and has tried to add to it. After allowing 13 sacks in those first two games, Karras said limiting for him to just two sacks Sunday was a big day in their effort to earn his trust. All right, Karras in his seventh season for six with the Patriots. Burrow hangs in the pocket, throws underneath. Here's Mixon, able to turn the corner and turn a one or two yard gain to do about seven. Duke Riley stops him there to be third down and one for the Bengals. And again, Miami is known as a blitzing, man-to-man, aggressive scheme. And I wondered if they would do that against Burrow and the great receivers that he has. Here, they're making him checking it down, make him be patient. But, boy, what an advantage when you can check it down and Mixon can make a guy miss and almost pick up a first down on second long. Boyd moving back and forth. He looked there, and he swings it out to Mixon. Has enough space to pick up the first down up to the 37-yard line. Really good job. We keep saying, Joe Burr, you're going to be patient. He always, you know, sometimes people say he holds on to the ball too long. He wants to take the shots downfield. Here it is third and short. Motion to the right. He wants to work to the right. He wants Boyd. Comes to the middle. Comes all the way back to the check down, his fourth option. And gives himself a chance to convert by getting the ball again to 28, Mixon. Why is it hot? Hey, feed me. Feed me. Why is it hot? Mixing again. Up to the 40-yard line goes the sixth year back, who is their number two pick in 17 out of Oklahoma. At that time, they're crowding the line. They're sensing this offensive line is playing maybe better than they anticipated. And on an early down, they play man-to-man, free safety in the middle, walk the other safety down, trying to just overload the offensive line. Forced Joe Burrow and these receivers to have to beat them, and they think they can get to Burrow before they can give up a big play through the air. Boyer was the defensive coordinator under Brian Flores and was retained when McDaniel got the... 94. Pretty clear. 15-yard penalty. Close down. Sam Hubbard, local kid, went to Ohio State. I think Hubbard thought that he's not a cheap shot type of player. I think he thought that he was still up. Maybe he didn't hear the whistle. That's the same thing his head coach, Zach Taylor, feels. And now they'll wind the clock. As we come to the two-minute warning with the Bengals leading the Dolphins 14-6. Kaylee Hartung back here in Cincinnati. And we have just learned from the Dolphins that Tua Tunga-Vailoa has sustained head and neck injuries. He was conscious, we're told, and he has just been taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center here. That's five and a half miles away from Pacor Stadium. It's a level one drama center out. All right, Kaylee, let's just hope for the best here. Kertua will work on him. Of course, the Dolphins will, as a team, fly home after the game. Meanwhile, with two minutes to go in the opening half, Bridgewater is quarterback after the personal foul, which was called on Hubbard, but B.J. Hill and Mike Hilton were all there, sending Mostert to the ground. takes it out to the 46-yard line. Only one timeout for the Dolphins. They've already used a couple in the first quarter, and that pass is caught, and there he goes. That is Waddell with a nice gain to the 35-yard line. Mike Hilton blitzed that time, and Bridgewater got it away. He gets it off before the blitz can get to him. Hilton hit him just as he let go of the football, but I'll tell you what, Waddell, relatively quiet night until that catch. Only one reception on the night. Luan Rumo is sitting back with a two-high safety look, and they split the safeties with a quick slant there, and the ball out of his hands quickly. Under a minute and a half. Bridgewater, that shoulder shake. Gets out of trouble and throws at the feet of Shurfield. Trey Hendrickson put the pressure on that time. Second down and ten. That is a tough ask for a tight end to make that block there on Hendrickson, who is just relentless, had the big game last week. AFC Defensive Player of the Week. Two and a half sacks, two forced fumbles. He was everywhere against the Jets in that time, chasing down Bridgewater. Facing his old teammate, Teron Armstead, tonight. Both have been played together for years at New Orleans. Second and ten. A little fakery. Pass. Gotten away. And that's Tyreek Hill. He takes the ball for a first down. And it moves the sticks at the 24-yard line. So you've got action going to the right. But watch Teddy Bridgewater really sell it. Again, that comes back to his experience in this league. By selling that, it just creates a little bit of hesitation and a little bit of doubt by the linebacker there that's trying to run with Tyreek Hill. It was Davis Gaither, but give the quarterback a little small little thing. All you need is a little bit more space for Tyreek Hill to pick up more yards for a first down. Five catches for Hill for 62 yards. Bridgewater, protection is good. Pass is good. Mostert makes the grab. taken down by Pratt after a gain of six, second down and four. You wonder, on a short week, how much a backup quarterback, how many snaps does he get in any week, let alone on a short week? But doesn't he look like he's, he looks really prepared and really in sync here in the early part of his opportunity. May have taken, we don't know, may have taken a few more this week to a situation to begin with. A lot of walkthroughs. After the week they had last week with so many snaps of being out on the field, the offense didn't get many chances. I think they were just more mental reps this week. But Teddy is ready to roll tonight. And flag could be a delay again. And it is. Offense number five. Five-yard penalty. Secondary. Back to the 23-yard line. come a head coach, first-time play caller. It's a lot to manage for Mike McDaniel. You know, in the past he would be in the ear of Kyle Shanahan suggesting plays, so he's always been preparing for this, but now you're doing it, you know, and trying to stay at his hands on the ball. But one of the things that, you know, we just showed you the graphic on Joe Burrow and Jamar Chase, what Miami's doing is they're rolling their safeties towards Chase and leaving. So they're going double team on Chase and leaving Howard one-on-one against T. Higgins. Mixing again. That kind of knife for him. No space here. Picks up three. Second and seven. One of the plans I think Zach Taylor had was, even though their running game has yet to really get going this year with a Miami defense coming off of the game last week against Josh Allen in Buffalo in that 95-degree heat with 90 plays short week. They still wanted to try to lean on him, try to lean on him, get into that third and fourth quarter and try to hope to wear down the Miami defense. Second and six from midfield. Burrow 10 of 17, now 11 for 18. But nothing happening there as Joe Mixon makes the grab out. A flat third and six. Again, they are doing the press. They're jamming these receivers, trying to take away any kind of throws downfield. Joe looks left to Boyd, to Higgins. Opps to try to just check it down, but quickly, the linebacker play led by Jerome Baker, right in position, leveraging the football, nowhere to go for Mixon. Third and long. Last time they had third and long. He had the long pass, 59 yards for a touchdown to Higgins. That matchup is back up at the top again. And this time with a flag down, he will go down. And Joe says, they got my face mask. Let's see what the referee Trey Blake says. Jaden Phillips almost got in for a sack, but the left guard, the rookie Volson, who's had a rough start this year, just had to hook up and try to hold him away from his quarterback. And he locked him up. Hold it. Offense, number 67. That penalty is declined. Zola play, fourth down. That is really an athletic group. When you have Ingram that comes in, you move Phillips as an outside guy inside, they get a lot of pressure without having to blitz with that kind of speed up front. Dolphins' first sack of the night, so on fourth and 14. Hubert comes in for his third punt of the game. Then Javon Holland is back inside his 15-yard line. Nearly blocked from the eighth. Holland to the 14-yard line. Elijah Campbell almost blocked it 10-11 to go in the third Two-point game in the Queen City From the tight ends coach And of course, you want a Curry favor With the head coach, you marry his daughter Which he did And they have four kids And loving every moment in Cincinnati Because he did spend one season here As an assistant coach with the Cincinnati Bearcats He came up to the Ohio State-Notre Dame game Had a chance to visit with him a little bit Brought his son up to the game kind of a father-son moment a few weeks ago. From the 14, they start this drive with a Mostert run. Taylor got the job. He was on the Rams staff with Sean McVay, who has sent four head coaches to the National Football League. McVay is still the youngest. Taylor is 39. And he got the job. It was a surprise in a way, but he was sought after at that point. And when he was heading to his interview with Mike Brown and the top brass here, he called a friend of his in the car phone. They spent 20 minutes on the phone, and he said, Hey, tell me the history of the Cincinnati Bengals. Because the friend had lived here for a bunch of years and knew it, and there was Mike Brown. Called a neighbor. Hey, give me the lowdown. Second down and five. That's Mostert. Of course, this team was founded by Mike's father, Paul Brown. He was also obviously the man with the Cleveland Browns, one of the great coaches of all time. back in 1968 as an expansion franchise in the American Football League. Do you remember your first game here? Take a look at Logan Wilson, who you and I just love watching, 55. I know you had him in the Super Bowl, and he is such a complete middle linebacker. Again, I think gets most of his attention because of his vision in pass defense, but is showing how tough he can be in between the tackles as well. Third down and four. Bridgewater steps up in the pocket Throws a little bit high And they could Dallas dug themselves a hole We're determined to get off to a fast start against the Jets When 11 plays, 75 yards and a touchdown On that opening drive a week ago And never looked back Yep On first down now From the 14 And you get a whistle before the snap Last week what they did is they Won the toss Teams almost always defer but they took the ball and it paid off. Taylor said we needed to start clean and fast, and they did. Luchas on the front here. Defense. Five-yard penalty. First round. And that's one thing that Zach Taylor would tell you that last year, an aggressive mindset with play calling, not backing down, getting off to a slow start at 0-2. Everybody thought they're going to start to be conservative. Instead, they go back to what worked last year, late in the year. Be aggressive. and that's what they're showing again here early on this opening drive. Only 5 out of 10 for touchdowns inside the 20, which is below average. So first and 5 now. Burrow to the outside and incomplete and looking for a flag and not getting one is Tyler Boyd. Coho covering on the play, second and 5. Coho is an undrafted free agent rookie, Texas A&M Commerce, and you will take that matchup every time into the boundary with a veteran like Tyler Boyd. He's got enough room to work. He's just trying to hit the back shoulder fade. Pretty tight coverage. Ball just didn't really give him much of a chance there. Ball thrown a little bit too far to the outside. Second and five. Mixon has some space. Close to a first down. Should have it at the five-yard line. Close to it anyway. It'll be either third and one or a first down. They're going to spot it outside the five, so it'll be third down. Watch Collins on the play side, but the backside guard Volson also pulls around. 71 right here does a nice job of establishing. Watch 67 come around. Nice kick-out block right there and allows Joe Mixon to get underneath that. You mentioned a good word. Gives Mixon some space. He's not had a lot of that to work with, And he's a big, powerful back when he has a chance to build up that momentum. Wilson, rookie out of North Dakota State on that revamped line. This is the ninth play of the drive. Three runs, five passes. Come up with a couple of tight ends and a whistle here. Play clock was all the way down. And was Taylor trying to call a timeout? Oh, yeah, he got his timeout, but I think he's frustrated with the officials. I'll say. Yeah. So, as it turns out, they do call the timeout. Here's Taylor. Yeah, he sees the play clock. He's all the way down. He's inside the 10-yard line. so third and inches that's the only way this drive has been stopped at this point on the ground again Nixon and Nixon still on his feet takes it all the way in Hit initially around the three and just kept on moving. Nine plays, 75 yards and 441, second week in a row. Off to the lead of the Bengals. Boy, that right side of that offensive line with some leg drive gives him a chance. Good vision to cut that right into Javon Holland. That's what you love to see. A back and offensive line on an opening drive just determined to break the plane and get the ball into the end zone. But give Alex Kappa a lot of credit, pushing, pushing all the way into the end zone for that touchdown. McPherson for the point after. Nixon, 16 touchdowns last season. This is his first of 2022. And early on, 7-0 Cincinnati. at it. Nice to see Tom Brady mentioned, just happy to be back home in Tampa Sunday night. All of our prayers, thoughts with the entire state of Florida and everybody impacted by that devastating storm. To it, tongue to Bailoa. Here he comes, third year in the league. Fifth overall pick in 2020. Play a two ahead. inside the 20. That is Mostert. Under a minute now. Davis Gaither makes the tackle. It'll be third down and five. Yeah, you're right. I mean, when he was, we're talking about McDaniel, the offensive coordinator, but we need the offensive coordinator for Kyle Shanahan or Sean McVay. Yeah. You're suggesting things. Correct. Like Frank Smith, who's his offensive coordinator that's trying to help him out. The aide to camp. Yeah. third and five conserving that last timeout 25 seconds Bridgewater dancing escapes throws and that's caught along the sideline at Shurfield and that's going to give them a first down and stop the clock with 15 seconds still have that timeout 14-6 they lead by 8 through the Bengals. Watch Bridgewater here. He's got a little bit of pressure. He's able to show his poise. Gets outside and now he keeps his eyes downfield. He's got the one timeout. Shurfield works back to him. Starts to go to the end zone. Comes back to him. Gets out of bounds. Now he got maybe a shot or two to the end zone because they were able to hold on to that timeout. From the 7. Shovel pass. Edmonds, can he get in? He spins, and he can. Touchdown, Chase Edmonds. So they had the sure field goal, but went for it after the third down completion. Bridgewater comes in. He's six out of seven for 71, and it's a two-point game. What a call. We just talked about Mike McDaniel as a play caller, and he calls a heck of a call. What a drive after the injury to it. Teddy Bridgewater comes in. The Bengals just took a pretty convincing lead and they come right back and move the ball down the field and end it with the shovel pass for the touchdown. So Sanders for the extra point. And just, oh, hits the upright and bounced back. So it stays at 14-12. And they're going for the two-for-one because they're going to get the ball to start the second half. Back to go to the touchdown. Yeah, by deferring. Watch the linebackers. You roll left. They're concerned about Tyreek Hill. Where's the speed? Watch them react to the rolls. They're getting depth. They're sinking. Now you've got a couple linemen that get out in front. And then the effort by Edmonds to have the spin move, it doesn't give up on it. Logan Wilson, great defender, kind of sinking. Now by the time he responds, you've got a couple linemen there that he's got to work around. But a heck of a call. Great timing there to use it at the right time. And Teddy Bridgewater leads the Dolphins down to that touchdown, as you said, deferring on the toss, winning the toss. They get the ball to start that second half. Going the old two-for-one here. Two-point game after the missed extra point. Good call, Coach. Yeah. He tapped Coach McDade. Sure. Love it. There's Darryl Bevel, another experienced veteran on this staff. Frank Smith's the offensive coordinator. Darryl Bevel, who's been around for so many years, quarterback, coach. You can see the job that he's done. There he is right there. The job he's done in getting Teddy Bridgewater ready to go as a backup just in case with the week that Tua's had. Kick here will go through the end zone. So coming up, it will be the Mercedes-Benz halftime show with Carissa and the guys. A recap of the first half. Started out a blaze. Yeah. Slowed down a little bit. Of course, it's all about Tua and his condition right now coming out. It'll be Bridgewater at the helm, obviously, in the second half. Kneel down. will take us to the break. It's halftime in Cincinnati. The score is the Bengals 14 and the Dolphins 12. After the break, the Mercedes-Benz halftime show. The line of vision Tua was asking for him because Tua wanted to understand. He was curious what happened on that play. His parents are now headed to meet him at that hospital, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Mike McDaniel told me, this is why you sign a guy like Teddy Bridgewater at free agency. In Cincinnati, 7-3. Bengals on top. It's third down and one for the Bengals at their own 38-yard line. Mixon, the running back. Play action. Under pressure. Gets it away. Caught. Has the first down, comes back, and now Wilcox, after backing up, picks up the first down. Javon Holland finally running him down, gain of 18 to the Miami 44. We've seen Hurst, now it's Wilcox, and it's yards after the catch. Gutsy call, fits the image of Zach Taylor, third and short. They don't want to run the ball. Instead, he needs just enough time to dump that to the backside to Wilcox, And there it is, another broken tackle here. Remember, Miami didn't tackle well early game one. It's been an emphasis for them to be better. But these tight ends are shaking these tackles off. Back to Mixon. Heavy workload already to the 40. He goes on his ninth carry of the night. We go to Kaylee again. Well, Al, Joe Burrow's family is hosting a really special guest at the game tonight. Steve Insminger, who was Burrow's offensive coordinator at LSU, is getting to watch Burrow play in person for the first time since they won the national tie together in 2019. Insminger told me he knew Joe Burrow's intelligence and football IQ were off the charts. The very first time they met and watched film together on his recruiting visit at LSU in 2018, Insminger says give Joe a half a second more any play and he can wreck anybody. Yeah, he was excited to know that he'd be here. where Saburo started his career at Ohio State. Did you know that? I think I did. Yeah. And then transferred. Yeah, he sat behind JT Barrett, and then eventually when Barrett graduated, he thought he could beat out Dwayne Haskins. He did not. And then he opted to transfer and ended up down in Baton Rouge. And every time you bring up that, because it was such eternal events in his life, he gets kind of emotional about the people who were willing, Coach O, Steve Inslinger, Joe Brady, the people that brought him down to Baton Rouge, and believed in him because it changed the direction of his life. Mixon again. Through the 33-yard line. So Joe Mixon in the first 18 minutes of the game, or less than that, 11 carries for 37 yards. And you can hear a buzz in the crowd because they're oohing and aahing and the offensive line getting a surge, especially on short yardage. Now, you may look at a four-yard carry, three-yard carry, and say whoop-dee-doo. This is an offensive line, as Al mentioned with the graphic. Only returning starter is Jonah Williams after a miserable year protecting Joe Burrow. They're still developing continuity, developing that chemistry, and it looks a lot better tonight here early. Six plays on this drive, five of them runs. Burrow with time, passes too high and incomplete at the 10-yard limit. A flag comes in. Asiasi, one of the tight ends was the intended receiver. Holland popped him. And the penalty's going against the Dolphins. Holland just sitting there in center field. He had time to pull off. And I think that's probably why they're going to throw this flag. He's got such range. No foul is what he said with the mic breaking up. So it'll come back instead of a 15-yard penalty. Back it goes to the 33 to the displeasure of the crowd. And, Terry, I'd love to ask you, we all as fans get so confused on any more what is a hit that's illegal, what is clean. What do you see there? Kirk, I saw shoulder to shoulder. I didn't see any forcible head and neck contact at all. Okay, good. And they finally got it right. The ball is at the 33-yard line. Second down and 10. Burrow scrambles away, he can run out of bounds he goes at the 29 yard line. Joe has great mobility but I think what a lot of us like is his mobility within the pocket and how he takes care of the ball so well coached on taking care of the ball Two hands on it Anytime there any kind of activity or a potential threat he takes care of the ball and then he quite the athlete I mean, he's not going to give up on a play. He gets out there and he's trying to think of positive yards to give himself a better chance on third down. Where do we got this? Third and five. with serious force, he goes down. And right as he goes down, you can see both his hands. You just get right away, you get concerned. They're bringing a stretcher out right now. And he was brought down. I mean, a big man bringing 340 pounds, bringing him down with a lot of force right onto his back and on the back of his helmet off of the week that he had last week. I mean, he's just being a gamer playing tonight, trying to be there for his team. Could see the concern of the rest of his teammates. We'll take him back, and Teddy Bridgewater will come in when play resumes. Medicine analyst, longtime trainer for the Jacksonville Jaguars before that, the Giants. and Mike Ryan tells us when he sees that, and he's watching this as you are as well, it's a neurological response to head trauma. So they're stabilizing him right now. Head hits the turf. Elbow hit first, then the head. And the heartbeat just turns around just like that. Again, worth mentioning it. Very similar sack last week, or push from Milano to Buffalo line when he hit his head on the game last week. See these players all huddled around him right now. Jalen Waddell, 17, we saw earlier. He, of course, went to school with him in Alabama, has known him for a long time. See how concerned he is. so Tua and the Tua chant going up from the Bengal crowd popular around the country such a great college career obviously one of the more likable personalities you'll ever come across yep and they'll take him back initially to the locker room there was the coach Mike McDaniel him to the send-off, and we'll get, as soon as we can, obviously, the official word as we hear it. Hmm. Yeah, you can hear the whole stadium yelling, Tua, Tua. Stabilizing him, keeping the helmet on as they wheel him back, and so Teddy Bridgewater, No stranger to the NFL as a starter with Minnesota for a number of years. Ninth year in the league out of Louisville. A man who himself had a terrible knee injury back in 2016, which appeared to be career-ending at that point. But back he came, and here he is. He's played a lot of football in his career, of course, at Denver last year. And knows about every offensive system in the NFL. Brings poise and leadership. and this team, this offense will try to rally around number five here. He comes in on the third and 17. Knowing that Tua was on the injury report, they did activate their third quarterback, Skyler Thompson, a rookie out of Kansas State, so he would be the backup for Bridgewater right now. He is active. Rarely do you activate the third quarterback. Third and 17. Bridgewater fires and that's going to be close to a first down with forward progress as he hits Trent Shurfield but they're going to mark it at the 34 shy by about a yard he needed 17, got 16 on the play heck of a job coming right in and making this throw on third down and long Tyreek Hill does a good job of clearing it see the speed there on the inside See the defender following him. Opens up, and he gets the ball out on time. Had to step up away from some trouble. A heck of a first throw there for Bridgewater on the night. Now Sanders is going to come in to try to kick a 52-yard field goal. If there is a prevailing wind, it is in this direction. Trying to give the Dolphins the lead. Way short. Might have been chipped. Got blocked. Jeff Gunter, number 93, got a hand on it. Still 7'6". And we are back. In fact, we're not only back, we're back. Started to go to commercial, and I'm told we don't need one right here. Get a little bit of penetration off the left side. Gets the hand up and keeps the lead for Cincinnati, at least for now. So Jeff Gunter, a seventh-round pick out of Coastal Carolina. Turn it over at the 42-yard line now. Job. So the system basically the same. Second down and eight. Burrow. Moving around in the pocket, and then it's incomplete. Trying to get it out to first at the last moment. The Dolphins, Kirk, over the last year, plus three games, have blitzed 45% of the time by far most in the league. And let's keep, we're going to be talking about this a lot, but Mike McDaniel's dealing with the team, if you didn't see it last week. It was an incredible battle of wills. Second half, their defense was on the field forever. 90 snaps all together as a team, as a defense. 95-degree heat. You can see guys needing help off the field after the game. Short week. We want to see how they can hold up tonight. You got tired just watching the game. That was crazy. P. Ryan is now in the backfield. swing him out, throw it to him, and he drops it. Incomplete coverage was good anyway. That was Jerome Baker. Step for step with him. It's fourth down. They walk up a lot of times, and they'll blitz. Sometimes they'll blitz. Sometimes they'll walk off. Here they walk up Carter to create attention, and then he backs out. But it still creates a one-on-one with Jonah Williams, and that's still Melvin Ingram still with that spin move at 33 years old in his 11th year. and is off to a great start for the Miami defense this season. Longtime charger with Pittsburgh and Casey last year. Picked him up as a free agent. Kevin Huber to do the punting. Hill is back there and Tyreek. Most football games you'll ever see. Up and down the field, each team goes. It winds up as a victory for Joe Burrow And company, as they win the game, 46-41. There were 33 guys who played in that game who are on active rosters right now in the National Football League. Pretty good night there. Seven touchdowns combined through the air. One of those games of the century between LSU and Alabama. And Burrow told us yesterday that's when he knew he was, he maybe had elevated himself to the point where he said, he didn't say the exact words, but I'm pretty good at what he said. Basically, he was telling us. Maybe I am as good as I thought I was. All right. Now, the Dolphins start from the 13 on this drive. Bengals on top, 7-3. Mostert is the back. And Mostert has a nice hole. Picks up a 12-yard gain, but we have a penalty. Get the call here in a moment from Trey Blake. going to go against the Dolphins. Holding. Offense number 10. Kennedy is half a distance to the bowl. First down. Was it you who predicted that of the 32 teams, only Philadelphia and Miami would be unbeaten? Of course. In September? Yeah, of course. Of course. You know, you show highlights from that game. You know what you don't know unless you're a diehard fan of those teams. Tua was injured badly two weeks before that game. He had that procedure where he tightened up his ankle just to be able to get healthy enough to try and play in that game. But that LSU team in 19, they were a machine led by Joe Burl. Think of the receivers that he had as well. It was a fun team to watch. It was a game you wish you had done, right? The CBS's game. They had the SEC contract. Yeah. So timeout taken here. And we'll go to Kaylee. Wow, that LSU-Alabama game wasn't just validating for Joe Burrow. His teammate then and now, Jamar Chase, said it was validating for him too and every guy on that team, like Justin Jefferson, Clyde Edwards-Alaire, just to name a few of the 17 LSU starters for that game who are now on NFL rosters. Alabama took the loss, but 16 of their starters are now in the league too. Kaylee is a diehard LSU Tiger. No kidding. Yes. She's pretty fired up about that year and that team. From the bayou. Even when the timeout was taken there by the Dolphins. It's going to be first down and 16 after the penalty and the timeout. You and I talked all the week and even today about remembering the blind side is Greg Little, the right tackle, not the left tackle, Armstead, where they paid the big money in the offseason to bring him in. So we'll keep an eye on that right side along with Hubbard across from him. Swing pass to the outside here still. Yeah, that is so interesting because they picked up Armstead. Meanwhile, you know, two is going to be the guy, but they have a new coach. And, of course, there was that tampering, in effect, with Brady, which led to the Stephen Ross suspension. They also were in the Deshaun Watson hunt, one of four teams. So, you know, you pick up Armstead figuring maybe I'll get a right-handed quarterback and you still wind up with Tua. Yep, yep. And it is an interesting story, the way it unfolded. But I tell you, I think they're very happy with where they are right now, with the way Tua seems to have really picked up this offense. We'll talk more tonight throughout the broadcast about Tua, the relationship with his staff and how it's impacted him and has him believing in himself again. play clock all the way to zero confusion with Tyree and the receivers timeout taken here again next Thursday night we will be in Denver the Colts at the moment are 1-1-1 the Broncos have eked out two wins you're going to see Jonathan Taylor you're going to see Russell Wilson next week pickoff at 8.15pm Eastern Time on Prime Commissioners here, Roger Goodell I think, I think that's Chris Collinsworth My partner for the last 13 years on Sunday night Roger's been to two of the three games That's right, so far That's right Traveling around with his traveling surface Second down and 13 at the 10-yard line Hangs in the pocket Passes right there That is Gasicki, the tight end, making the catch. Hung in the pocket, perfectly thrown, gain of 20. How about that accuracy? I mean, he's able to throw this ball right into a tight window to Gasicki, who's got great length. Nice job, reads it. Look at that throw. I mean, you're talking about putting it over top of Logan Wilson, a linebacker, in between the safety baits in the corner, perfectly thrown, and great timing again by Tua. under two minutes to play now in the opening quarter handoff here to Mostert you know what's so funny, I was thinking about remember Tyreek Hill in the offseason Tyreek loves to talk and they asked him to compare Mahomes to two, and the one thing he did say about was that Tua's got better accuracy yeah, and everybody said, what is he doing? because Tua had two years that were forgettable, and now he's off to a great start, and I just want to say Mike McDaniel, not just the scheme, but the job that he and Daryl Bevel have done in just picking up the pieces and getting him to believe in himself again after those two dreadful years and putting him in a scheme where he feels comfortable. Going deep, downfield, into double coverage, and should be picked off at the 29-yard line. Vaughn Bell was there. The coverage was perfect. They tried to get at the hill. That didn't fool the Bengals. And they come away with the interceptions. The one knock on Tua has always been the arm strength. If he's going to throw deep to these receivers, he's got to do it early. I want you to look how he looks to his right. Looks, looks, then he comes back and tries to throw a long ball, underthrows the ball, and allows Von Bell to make the easy interception. If you're going to throw to Tyree Kill downfield, it's one foot in the ground, let it fly. And because he hung it up, it gave Vaughn Bell a chance to come back and make the play. Bell, the former Saint, seven years in the league. It's his third interception. You see those eyes. He was looking, looking to the right, and then he came back just too late. Could not make that long of a throw. Then they'll start from their own 29. Nixon, good effort on first down. Eric Rowe trips him up, gives him seven yards. make it second down and three, final minute of the quarter. It's a little jump cut there by Joe Mixon. Again, had the puller pulling around in a couple puller. Wilcox to tie it in. Volson, the guard, who's been very active tonight, moving around. And then he shows that quickness for a big man, bouncing that thing to the outside. Positive yards, again, on first and ten. Seven carries for Mixon, 24 yards for a guy averaging less than three per toad coming in. And now up the middle here. on his eighth carry. He stopped a yard and a half shy of the first down. The interior of this Dolphins defense with Seeler and Wilkins has been tough for anybody in these first three weeks to run the ball and especially into that interior. Bengals are holding their own considering how they have run the ball early this year. It's not been pretty. Will they run a play before the quarter expires? No, they will not. And then it's the end of the first quarter in Cincinnati with the Bengals on top of the Dolphins 7-3 This is that having to wait for it. That was Gisicki and Mike Hilton is able to stop on Walsh I the first down Well they drop to a Tampa 2 coverage meaning they have two safeties that are deep middle linebacker gets deep a lot of space underneath gotta make tackles in space and then you're talking about Mike Hilton who's one of the best at being able to do that and keeping the big tight end short of that first down. Great play again by 21. Thomas Morstead after a three and out. Long time Saints punter. And this is a beauty. All the way to the 13-yard line. Trent Taylor not past the 20. Nice run back to the 36-yard line. And that's a punt of 65 yards, and we're back in 30 seconds. 65-yard Morristead punt, but one of those classic outkicking the coverage kicks. Taylor returned it for 22. This drive begins at the 35-yard line. Burrow protected well, and that's caught in a lot of traffic by T. Higgins, who takes the ball into Miami territory across midfield. You think of T. Higgins, you think of him going downfield with his great length, straight line speed. Area that he's really worked a lot on is to become a guy that's more complete. Here he is against Howard, one-on-one. Who's going to win that battle? T. Higgins gets inside leverage there with a good route. Joe Burrow takes advantage of that separation. Strong hands to hold on to the ball in a good play. Four catches for T. Higgins, 93 yards, including the touchdown. Mixing to the outside Can we get a block? A little bit Picks up about 4 or 5 Baker makes the tackle Higgins tonight Well, they're working on Xavier and Howard, they really are Yeah, you're working on one of the top corners in the NFL, you see the interceptions 27 since 2017 Most in the NFL and they're going right at him with that matchup If you're going to take Jamar Chase away with double coverage, that's one of the beauties are having this offense. Now they're getting the ball to Higgins. The guy that we've not called his name is Tyler Boyd, who I'm shocked that they've not been able to get him the ball yet. But I'm sure eventually they're going to try to get 83 more involved. Second down and six. Boyd is the motion man. And that pass downfield is broken up. Jamar Chase, the intended receiver. Nick Needham covering on the play for the Umana of Texas, El Paso. But with Byron Jones down, Needham has had to step up. He's usually a slot guy, but they have him on the outside while Jones is down. And there's no safety help. So right away, Joe Burrow says, I'm going to my guy. But he underthrows it, throws it outside, and gives Needham a chance to come back to the ball. No safety. Holland in the middle of the field. Joe Burrow looked him off, so he had the matchup that he wanted. Third down, six. Six and a half left in the third. Downfield, over the head of an incomplete. By the time it's Chris Evans coming out of the backfield. Brandon Jones covers on the play and it's fourth down. Trying to go to the running back who's known for his receiving skills. Put him in that slot. They're going to leave him one-on-one against the safety. That's a tough 50-50 ball on third down. So Uber comes in to try to pin the Dolphins deep. Holland sets up at the 10-yard line. Fair catch pulled for and made at the 10-yard line. Downs are in the mid-50s right now. As we wind up for September on the 29th tonight. Final NFL game of the month. And the Dolphins trying to stay unbeaten. Coming in 3-0. Since you come in at 1-2. Bridgewater at the helm from the 10-yard line. Start on the ground. Closer. Moses had an interesting career. He started out. He was bouncing around. He's been with seven teams. He looked like he was going to evolve into a major star that one year in San Francisco. Had a tremendous game in the NFC Championship against Green Bay. One of the fastest running backs in the NFL. And the good thing for him is so familiar with Mike McDaniel's scheme coming over from San Francisco. But a 4-3-7. Get out of bounds. Stays in. Clock keeps rolling. Under a minute now. and it's going to be fourth down and four to try to keep their hopes alive. The flickering hopes. Great job by Trey Flowers there, right? Just keeping him inbounds, willing to give up yards, but leverage, keeping him away from the boundary. Take their final timeout. Update now on Tua. Kaylee, what you got? Al, we just learned that Tua Tungavailoa is expected to be discharged from the medical center here in Cincinnati, and the team tells me they believe he will be traveling back to Miami with them tonight. Oh, that's great. That's great news. Yep. Small baby steps here on the way to recovery. That's very cool to hear. Heis' mom and dad were here able to get over to the hospital and be with him. Very tight-knit family. They've been with him this entire ride through Tuscaloosa down to Miami. Last chance. Dolphins trying to keep it alive, and a timeout is taken by the Cincinnati Bengals. Cincinnati, their second of the half. 30-second timeout. So the Bengals, if they win 2-2, this is the NFL. Everything is razor thin. The two losses, one in overtime, field goal, right? Yeah. The other at the gun in Dallas, right? Think about how they lost that Pittsburgh game. Sure. You lose your long snapper, and you have maybe one of the best kickers in the league. I think if it's Shantrick, blocks what would have been the winning extra point. And five turnovers, still had a chance to win that game. And it didn't go much better in Dallas. They were behind the sticks offensively. And Micah Parson showing the world how legitimate of a pass rusher he is. I mean, bringing back images of Lawrence Taylor, the way he's off to a start as a pass rusher. Woulda, coulda, shoulda. They could say we could be 4-0, and the Browns could say we should be 3-0. Fourth and four. Can they keep it alive? No, they cannot. They're going to rule him, even though the officials are now going to confer to see nope if he's inbounds or not and they say no look who ends the game there Eli Apple against Tyree Kill the ball hits the ground and that's going to send the Bengals back out on the road next up for them will be at Baltimore then at New Orleans Next home game in three weeks against Atlanta. Then they go to Cleveland. So it's been a road-heavy early schedule, which is bad news for them at one point. But the good news is when you play a lot of road games early, you play a lot of home games late. Yeah, it's coming back later. Okay. In London, Minnesota plays New Orleans Sunday morning, 9.30 Eastern time. And then the Bears and the Giants. The Fox game in the early window on Sunday. New England and Green Bay. Big one. The late window on CBS. Kneel down. We'll end it. Sunday night game will be played in Tampa. There was some question about that until today. KC against the Buccaneers. Joe Burrow has guided his team to a 2-2 start. Teddy Bridgewater. Of course, we'll see about Tua and what happens to him down the line. Teddy for the moment is the Miami quarterback. 27-15, getting a little lower scoring than we might have thought. You know what I mean? Yeah. I think I have an idea what you're talking about. All right. Like a lot of people. Yes, of course they do. Don't go anywhere. Post game show with Chris and the boys. For Joe Burrow with Jamar Chase. Three catches now, 45 yards for Chase. Burrow's throwing for 249. Mixon again. Nothing again. If it's not Wilkins, then it's Seelam. You know, these two work so well together. He's right here. And again, you have Wilkins, who's in there, 94 at the other side. 92 on this side. You see those long arms able to just keep Jonah Williams off of him. It has been tough to run the ball on the Dolphins tonight. Six and a half left. In the fourth. Second and eight. My name is. My name is. Play action. Good protection. Down the sideline. Out of bounds. Higgins is there. Needham covering on the play. It'll be third down and eight. We've seen Miami do this, and it's been working. When you motion, try to get a matchup that you like. How many times have we seen, even early this year, with Tyree Kill? He puts his foot in the round, goes full speed. T. Higgins a little bit different. Just trying to create that same matchup. Good adjustment. Needham just followed him from one side to the other. Has him man-to-man. Third down and eight. Flag is thrown. That blows the play dead. I made it. I made it. It could be. Well, they pull. The fall short. It looks like maybe 12 guys on the field as well for Miami. Offense, number 73. Five-yard penalty. And let's look into the field. Elijah Campbell was trying to get off and apparently did in time. Yeah, they had 12 men on the field. That's why they hurried. Jonah Williams just went a little bit too quick, the left tackle. Here's the 12th man right here. And watch Jonah Williams right here. He just gets out of his stance a little bit too early. Ball start kills the play. 12 or more regardless on the other side. Third down and 13 now. makes a field goal attempt if they don't pick up the yard here a lot longer, and that's dropped. So now we'll see what they want to do. McPherson has the leg to kick from this distance, and the question is, do you want to bring him in or the punter and try to pin him deep, and McPherson's going to come in. Abro Kohu, again, the undrafted free agent, pretty tight coverage. Looked like Boyd may have had his hands on it, But tight coverage there in this slot. The rookie from Texas A&M Commerce doing a really good job tonight. 57-yard attempt. Of course, the downside, if you miss Miami, he's going to hit the ball near midfield. McPherson, who had a tremendous rookie season. Hits it. Would have been good from 64. Taylor makes the goal and pays off. And the Bengals lead 20-15 with 6-13 left in the fourth. Going back to your roots this week. Many moons ago with the Reds. Five-point game here. A yard in the end zone. Mostert's going to bring it back. To about the 22. going back to halftime, they honored Isaac Curtis, the great wide receiver. There was Kenny Anderson, quarterback. There was Curtis going in. Willie Anderson, the offensive tackle. Number 71. There he was. Then they're watching a good game. 20-15 McPherson banging through that 57-yarder. McPherson, 15 of 17 now in his brief career from 50-plus regular and postseason. So the crowd completely into it now from the 23-yard line. They start with a Mostert run. Raheem Mostert out near midfield. Gets tackled up at the 47-yard line by Jesse Bates. Greg Little on the right side here with Smite. Good double-team kickout right here. and then he just gets his underneath. Remember, Logan Wilson making all these tackles. He actually overruns the play, gives him the cutback, and we know what kind of speed he has once he's able to hit that alley. Bridgewater hands it off and nothing happened in this time. So after a 24-yard gain, a loss of two or three, Hubbard is there for the tackle. Second down, let's call it 12. They went right back to it, and Sam Hubbard this time gets underneath the block of Greg Little, completely disrupts the play. That's great quickness and strength there by Hubbard. Rolling, looking, settles underneath for a very short game. hill tacking the phone of the since he benched so a very key play here with a third down and ten everybody in the white tonight the white towels the white uniforms The White Tiger helmets. Third and ten. Four-man rush. Bridgewater escaping, twirling. And Teddy Bridgewater's going to get the first down. Awuji knocks him out of bounds, but legally close. First down. You know, that's only their second conversion on third down. And we do have a flag down on the field. This is Teddy Bridgewater, who's had to step in for Tua. There's penetration. Good job of avoiding that from Hendrickson. And then he reminds him, in his prime, this is what he can do on third down. Still has enough to be able to avoid that pressure and pick up the first down. Penalty is illegal contact on the defense decline. You know, last year, all year long, 17 games on third and 10 plus, 10 or more. Yeah. They converted three times. They've already done it five times this year. And what a critical moment to get their second tonight. Just their second third down conversion. Under five minutes to go, down five. They added the five yards at the end of the play. After an 11-yard gain on the contact. First down from the 37 line Mostert to the outside Gets around the corner Inside the 30 Can sample 96. Makes the tackle gain of a second down and two. Clock ticking to four and a half to go in regulation. Anytime that ball bounces, you worry about that edge, right? Durham Smythe to tie it in. Is he going to hold on to sample the edge of that defense? 96. But he does a good job of locking it down and giving him room to get to the outside. Bridgewater, 11-15 for 163 in relief of Kua. The ground again. Gets enough of the first down, does Moster. Having a nice night. 15 carries for Raheem. 69 yards. Mixing up these play calls right now with Mike McDaniel. But, you know, I wondered, with Teddy Bridgewater stepping in, how much confidence would he show in Bridgewater on a short week without a lot of reps to get ready? And I think it's been business as usual. They're just continuing to trust five and believe, because of that experience in his league, he's going to be able to make the plays and have command, and he's shown that. First pass when he came in was a 16-yard gain. Yep. Bridgewater down the sideline and throws that one out of bounds. Sam Hubbard put the pressure on. Knocks Teddy down, second down and 10 from the 26. Good call there by McDaniel. They've been running so much on first and 10 and having some success. They try to catch them out of position with a play-action attempt on an early down. Try to create that one-on-one matchup. But again, good tight coverage there by Wouzier on that first and ten throw. Chase looks on. Second down at ten. Pressure from the outside. Picked off at the nine-yard line. Vaughn Bell, his second of the game. and the run back is into Miami territory all the way to the 45. You throw him and Waddle and Hill all together. They're just continuing to find unique ways to get them the ball in space and give them enough room to do some damage. The track star at Purdue. Second down and five. Off the fake pass over the middle. It's pulled into the 30-yard line by Shurfield and a first down. The action here with a jet sweep. Then you fake it to Moser. Watch the linebackers have to freeze. Just watch the hesitation. They have to see the jet sweep, the fake, and now the ball's out. Really well designed. Nice job of just sitting in that void. The soft spot there by Shurfield. Tua mentioned to us, even though 14 hasn't had a lot of chances, he's got a good feel for its zone or its man, and he and Teddy that time hook up for the first down. Four catches, 55 yards. Bridgewater airing it out deep downfield and that is caught on the rebound by Hill Oluge is right there with him keeps his concentration pulls it in and it's 65 yards and a first down and goal he's reading Jesse Bates the free safety in the middle of the field he gets caught up in a crosser over the middle so creates one on one Speed against speed. Who's going to win? Here's the arm strength by Teddy Bridgewater to give Tyree Kill a chance. The bobble, and then he's able to secure it. But the safety biting up created that opportunity to get that ball downfield. Six catches, over 100 yards for him. A little toss back to Mostert, taking it to the two-yard line, second down and goal. Arm strength there by Teddy Bridgewater. He can still spin it. And we saw Tua have a chance earlier in the game when he just couldn't quite get the ball downfield. And this time, you can see the throw here by Bridgewater. Just puts everything into that ball. Miami trying to take the lead. 10-0 on this play. That is Mostert who stopped at the line of scrimmage. Third down and goal. Three and a half to go in the third. There's our guy, Logan Wilson, again, making that play. Freed up. Offensive line eaten up by those big defensive linemen. So 55. Here's a great look at him right here. Nobody's able to climb up. He gets downhill in a hurry. Short game. Drive started at the 10-yard line. Sixth play of the drive. Third and goal. crowd in full throw Hill lines up in the backfield Bridgewater surveys, spins away extends the play throws and it's incomplete at the goal line intended for Hill base coverage on the play fourth down and goal watch the power here on the left side Former teammates going head-to-head. Trey Hendrickson just pushing Armstead right back into the backfield. Armstead is forced out of the pocket, and nobody out there. Great coverage downfield, but Hendrickson again pushing his former teammate from New Orleans. Armstead into the face of Teddy Bridgewater. If you're aggressive, maybe you think about going for it, but they're playing the score right now. You just need a field goal to take the lead. Sanders who missed an extra point earlier hits this one through so the Dolphins who were down by eight are now up by one let's go to Kaylee well Teddy Bridgewater told me pregame that he prepared for this game the same way he has for every game he has started since week three 2019 for the Saints against the Seahawks. And he points specifically to that game because one week before that, Drew Brees got hurt against the Rams. He injured his thumb, and Bridgewater was thrust into action then. But Teddy told me he was not prepared mentally for that moment, and he never wanted to have that feeling again. It's an interesting career that he's had, Kaylee. I mean, clearly a starter and a star had that devastating knee injury but has bounced back. But he's kind of, you know, he has to adapt to being the backup. Yeah. But right now, who knows how long he's going to have this job. Yeah, I think it's a mindset. There are certain guys that are able to do that, and that's why they have longevity. At some point, you accept that that's your role, and you're ready to go when called upon. I think that his teammates respect that. And, boy, has he stepped in in a very difficult set of circumstances and provided this offense with a little bit of a spark. We go to the Rockies next Thursday night on Prime. The Indianapolis Colts coming off that big win over Kansas City against the Broncos, who are scratching and clawing, but somehow they're 2-1 at this point, eking out two victories. Good defense. I mean, they're just finding a way right now to win some games, but their defense, we'll see if the Colts can get things going again this week. after that Kansas City win. Yeah, you went 11-10 and ate the offense, right? From the 25-yard line. Burrow off play action, throws, and that's fourth flag is down. Peyton Hurst, the tight end for the moment. We'll get the call here from referee Trey Blake in a moment. They get the right tackle here, Collins. Hold it, offense, number 71. 10-yard penalty, first pass. So September winds down with this game. This is why people love the NFL. This whole month has been insane. We didn't even talk about Miami's win over Baltimore, 42-38, two through six touchdown passes. One of the classic games in recent memory. Yeah, and then they found a way to win a game a different way the following week where they had to rely on their defense. The offense didn't have very many chances. You're right. It seems like a lot of these NFL games, hold your breath, comes down to the final possession. You'll like it, don't you? I'm enjoying it. First and 20. That is caught. And to the 25-yard line goes T. Higgins. Second and 11. Duke Riley makes the tackle on the plate. See what Zach Taylor and Joe Burrow can do to, again, try to find that rhythm that they had earlier in this game. It was a combination of really good job of running the football, being aggressive, throwing. A lot of quick throws where the ball was out of the hands of Joe Burrow. It just seemed like they were more assertive, more decisive early. And Miami, to their credit, they've jammed up those receivers. There's not a lot of separation other than that throw we saw to Tee Higgins. Saw Chase come into the line. Only one catch for him tonight. Now the handoff to Pirine. Nothing happening there. Crowd gets restless again. Third and long. How about the battle in the trenches? Christian Wilkins. Watch 94 here. Eyes in the backfield. Has a really good feel to be able to know where he's going. Gets involved. That play's run completely to the other side. So you have Seeler who's able to hold his point and then you have the athletic ability of Wilkins to work through a lot of traffic to once again negate that running game. Final minute of the third. Swing it out here. Play is alive. Throw. Caught. 45-yard line. Tyler Boyd to Jamar Chase. So Boyd has been silent as a receiver tonight. Yep. But as a passer, perfect. Pretty good job there by Jamar Chase. Just kind of selling this right here before he gets downfield. And don't forget, Tyler Boyd was a great high school quarterback. Shows that right there. If he just lobbed that in there, no chance. Holland comes over and knocks it away. Look how he threw that on a line, which gave Chase a chance to hold on to it and step out of bounds. Seven years in the league. It's his fifth pass. And third completion for Tyler Boyd. Under 20 now. First and 10. Off the fake. Burrow throws. Caught. 49-yard line. There is Tyler Boyd's first catch after he throws that pass. It'll be second down, and that's going to take us to the ultimate fight. Let him throw one? What the heck? There you go. Give the guy a chance to have a catch. End of three. Talking about how the Bengals have been going at Howard all night long. He was on the injury report with a glute and a groin injury, and you can see right there, there's your evidence of one of the reasons they were going after him all night long. Yeah, yeah. He came in not quite at 100%. Cincinnati went after him, probably a big part of that reason, and they'd be using their safety to help out. Now they're down to a couple backup corners trying to hold up against these Bengal receivers. Keon Croson in his spot right now. Burrow has time. Burrow goes deep. Got a man. It is Boyd, who's been dead solid until three or four plays ago, sets up a first and goal. Well, he's man to man. The route sells out and then back across. Watch him work from the right side. Sells like he's going outside. And then comes back the other way to take the safety away. And a good ball there by Joe Burrow out in front of him. Completing 65% of his passes. McPherson for the point after. Huber puts it down. Evan bangs it through. And it makes it 27-15. All the action goes right. I mean, they're showing Mixon again. trying to get this defense to move, and then they just bring Hurst back this way and slide him out into the flat. Nobody picks him up. Aggressive defense trying to take away the potential of the run again, thinking maybe Cincinnati runs, makes them use that last timeout, and instead they get the touchdown. 152. So for Miami They've got the Half a bye week which you always get After the Thursday night game Upcoming they go to the Jets A week from Sunday In home games against Minnesota And Pittsburgh Meanwhile for Cincinnati This is their only home game in a five game stretch They play the last two on the road And the next two on the road as well They needed a win tonight. You can see the energy from Joe Burrow going to every one of those offensive linemen and encouraging them. Maybe they didn't have a great night pushing people off the ball, but they gave him enough time to be able to throw and come up with 27 points. But he's helping build their confidence. Next week, first game of week five, Thursday night. We go to Denver. Broncos against the Colts. And check out the alternate stream. Hannah Storm and Andrew Kramer, two of our favorites. Bringing you the game to life with interviews and storytelling only on Prime Video. From the 25. Bridgewater. Hill. Tyreek out to the 35-yard line. You have one timeout. Quick striking offense with Waddle and Hill. All you gotta do is try to make a guy If you get Wad or Hill, make a guy miss, you can try to get a quick score. Hill again. Trying to get out of bounds, which he does. He's not refilled tonight. That's 10 catches, 13 targets, and 159 yards. Almost unfair when he gets the ball in space. So Mike Hilton, all the Bengals are trying to do is keep him in bounds. work that clock, make him use that last time out. He'll lay Hill that time going by him. So Bridgewater and a little more than a half has thrown for 187 yards. Total yardage just about even. 372 for Miami. 373 for Cincinnati. Bridgewater. In the pocket, throws incomplete. Just as well there, but you said, most have been tackled in bounce. Clock would have kept rolling. Stops at 118. Mike McDaniel there trying to get a hold of Trent Shurfield, get him over to the right side. He wanted three receivers to that right, try to clear it out, try to get a one-on-one matchup, which is tough, you know, when you put your back, Mozart, against Logan Wilson. Second and ten. Bridgewater has to slide away, gets away, and just slings it away. And, of course, the Bengals bench wants intentional grounding. Did he get it back to the line of scrimmage? Sam Hubbard forced the issue. Third down and 10. And Hubbard and B.J. Hill, the officials are actually going to get together now. Hubbard gets in there first. Just overpowers Greg Little. There's no foul court since in the ground. There's a receiver in the area. Hubbard uses strength more often than not. Look at his right tackle. Just right on his back. Looked like he might have the sack. And then you see B.J. Hill also helping out. Well, it's fun to watch for Hubbard. Won't be a lot of fun for Little this week in the tournament. Third and ten. Bridgewater. Pressured again. Throws. Mostert. Trying to pick up the extra yardage and can't. Mike McDaniels calling in the plays here. Second down and three. From the 32. And close to the first down, Edmonds. You know, you look at McDaniel. Central casting would not put him in the role of the head coach, right? Let's start with that. No. But I'm trying to think. You know, if Jason Sudeikis finishes up with Ted Lasso, maybe the next thing he does is Mike McDaniel. What do you think? That's pretty good. I like that. You thought about that one all week. Oh, sure. I thought about it all week. I thought about it like the last 11 seconds. There you go. Different. He has a different approach, to be sure. But, again, because he's himself and he's authentic, I think people really accept it and love it. Started his career by beating Bill Belichick in New England. And stuffed in the backfield, Chase Edmonds. Logan Wilson is right there fourth and issues and in comes the punting group Lou Anarumo the defensive coordinator stacks the inside eats up all those linemen we keep seeing it over and over and over again it frees up Logan Wilson who has great instincts and feel he's anticipating this gets downhill boom hits Edmonds well short of that first down Thomas Morstead who kicked a 66-yarder earlier. Trent Taylor is back, standing inside his 25-yard line. This one much shorter, line drive. They're going to let it bounce. And it takes a little bit of a skip to the 26-yard line. Mike McDaniel went to Yale, graduated with a degree in history. Play some football here. Graduate of Shanahan State degree in offense under Mike and Kyle. Denver, Houston, Washington, then Cleveland, then Atlanta for a couple of years, then San Francisco under Kyle the last five seasons. He's always preparing for maybe an opportunity down the road to become a head coach while working for such great minds in this game. rolling to his right Higgins and he gets bounced out of bounds legally Holland hit him in bounds and then Higgins flew well out of bounds I think that's what the crowd reacted to talking about Mike Shanahan he comes up for the veterans group for the Hall of Fame every year and we don't like to politic for people but you look Not only did Mike win two Super Bowls, and was the offensive coordinator when the 49ers beat San Diego in 94. Look at that tree. Look at the trail behind him. Anyway, my two cents is worth one cent. Second and ten. Over the middle, wide open, 45-yard line to the 50 goes T. Higgins. Higgins tonight, seven catches for 124 yards. This time they sit back a little bit. They play cover two, two safeties deep. They don't jam. Don't disrupt the timing the way they have, and it allows Higgins to sit right in there, see that catch radius, long arms, able to reach back and make that catch. But Joe Burrow finally gets back, reaches the apex of his drop, and realizes, hey, I got an opportunity here to hit the receiver in time. Flitch from the corner. No gain on this play. Taken down is Joe Mixon. Second and ten. Keep talking about how this offensive line with four new starters, looks like they're coming around. Maybe they're developing chemistry. And then as game has gone on, it's been kind of the same old, same old, as far as their inability to move this Miami defense off of the line of scrimmage at the point of attack. Really makes them one-dimensional where they have to rely on Burrow in this passing game. Three tight ends in this set. Second down and ten. Burrow, good protection again. Finds the open spot. That's Jamar Chase along the sideline. For a first down. Jamar Chase halfway through the quarter. Again, soft coverage. Jamar Chase against a fairly inexperienced corner in Needham, who's usually, again, a slot guy. Gets the ball up and over that defensive lineman. makes a very accurate throw, but that is pitch and catch. Kohu is an undrafted free agent, a rookie. Look at that separation by Tyler Boyle. 43 yards, first and goal. Staying on the ground, getting about halfway home is Joe Mixon. Second down and goal. Mixon tonight, 17 carries, 50 yards along of seven. Eric Rowe there held on to keep him out but finally Joe Mixon again with a little bit more room we saw it early in the game and this time they opened that up nicely made the safety Rowe make the play Rowe just came out of the game from the three yard line second and goal changing it play clock at one and Cincinnati is going to have to take a timeout. Zach Taylor ran down just before the play clock went off. Take a look at the standings right now. With these two teams involved, the Dolphins 3-0 again with Philadelphia, the only unbeaten teams in the league. The Bills 2-1. Jets and Patriots are each 1-2. Meanwhile, the Browns are 2-1. The Ravens are 2-1. The Steelers and the Bengals 1-2. And the figures to be a very tight AFC North race. We talked about, even though it's early in the year, sitting at 1-2, defending AFC champs. You lose this game at 1-3, 10 days until you go on the road to Baltimore. This is, I don't want to say it's a must win early in the year, but this is a big change. It could change the complexion of things. Second and goal. Mixon keeps on chugging stop inside the one yard line so third down and goal for the Bengals Roberts would not give up here Landon Roberts 52 I thought the offensive line would push and eventually pushed it not just the defensive line good push on Wilkins Look at 52 get in there against Collins, and he holds his own. Sheds that block, gets underneath Mixon to keep him out of the end zone. Great play by Roberts. Good job. Yeah. Former Patriot. Inches away, third down and goal. Mixon again. No. Andrew Van Ginkle that time. 43. Stops him. Fourth down and goal. How about Roberts? We just talked about the play that he made. He blows this play up. Throws Kappa just back into the right here. Right through that right guard Kappa. Watch his push. Boom! Blows it up. Times it up perfectly. And just disrupts the timing completely on this play. Crowd doesn't like it. But again, as McDaniel played the scoreboard on the last drive by Miami, Taylor's playing the scoreboard here. field goal gives you the lead McPherson with a chip shot and three minutes into the fourth quarter back and forth we go with the Bengals now leading 17 looks like a concussion but he passed that protocol turned out to be his back then tonight he gets slammed down at around the 50 yard line taken down there put him on the stretcher, took him out. He's at a local hospital. His parents, Nalu and Diane, are both there with him. Head and neck injury, but he has movement in all extremities. So simply hoping for the best here. Of course, you know, last week a lot of folks thought, well, wait a second. And the league said he passed the concussion protocol, but hold on. Still some work to be done on that. And now, of course, this is going to open up a little bit of a hornet's nest. Yeah, it will. And I think when you and I and our team prepared for this game, of course, that was one of the first things we talked to him about. And Tua and Miami, everybody we ever talked to said, you know, it's his back and his ankle more than it has anything to do with the head injury, which was surprising, really, after you saw the hit and you saw him stumble. I think we all assumed it was maybe, you know, where he got pushed by Milano and knocked back on the ground. that's Hill making the catch Dolphin said he passed the NFLPA not happy about it and they're doing their own investigation that's right Players Association yard line Vaughn Bell and the defense running down to celebrate miscommunication by Bridgewater and Gesicki Vaughn Bell is sitting at the top they're trying to hit a seam inside of him. Ridgewater thinks he's going to look for this ball to the inside. Right behind Logan Wilson. Instead, he throws it to the outside. Or Gusecki's not expecting it. And Vaughn Bell is just waiting there in the back behind. Playing back there in a too-high safety look. And he throws it right into his arms. Vaughn Bell had two career interceptions in 96 games. Two tonight. Why not do it in prime time? From the 45-yard line. This is Mixon cutting to the outside and still can't get free. Longest game tonight, seven yards on 22 carries. Joe Burrow has had to work tonight, but at times, let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. When he has had time to work, he's been able to make some things happen, most notably to T. Higgins, who's been one-on-one. There's the pocket again. Everybody wondered, how would this offensive line do? They've been struggling all year. They struggled last year. They made the changes. Could they give Burrow enough time against this aggressive defense? They've done just enough, and you saw maybe the difference in a game, the big touchdown to Higgins down the left sideline against Xavier Howard. Miami stops the clock with a timeout, so they've got two timeouts remaining, plus a two-minute warning. second and seven. First and goal. Put the heat on. Feats Crossan, and Jamar Chase takes the ball to the five-yard line instead of a first down and goal. Beats him at the line of scrimmage. Remember, he got back up corners in. Crossan never had a chance. Inside move, then works back to the outside where the ball is perfectly thrown over his outside shoulder. with Howard out and Jones, who's out all, didn't even dress tonight. It's up to Needham and now Cross and being left out there on islands. They're expecting run and an aggressive play call there by Zach Taylor. Four catches, 81 for Jamar Chase after a slow beginning of the game. The ground again. And this time, keeping the legs churning, Nixon takes the ball to the one-yard line, And that takes us to the two-minute warning. Bengals trying to get to two and two. Miami trying to stay unbeaten, but in the hole right now. 20-15 Cincinnati. That used to be Paul Brown Stadium. Now Pacor, and it's the largest crowd in Bengals history. And they want to see a touchdown right here at second down and goal. From inside the two-yard line. give it to Mixon not the cleanest handoff and it'll be third down goal Brandon Jones and Nick Needham so for Miami can you hold them to a field goal which would keep it as a one possession game I think Joe Burrow got stepped on there he talked about not having a clean handoff the left guard step see if he gets stepped on there it just looked like something slowed him down from getting that ball out And it moves to center back step. Yeah, right there. Garris. Right on the right foot. They're having a tough time running the ball against Miami's defense. I'll say. Inside that two-yard line. They cannot get a push. Tough time, period. Oh, yeah. But especially down in here. 24 carries, 61 yards. Miami just took a timeout here. One left. Third and goal. Off the fake. Wide open. In for the touchdown. Hayden Hurst to tight end. A fullback or a guy playing fullback anyway. Off the fake. Hit Hurst. Touchdown. If you can't push him, you're going to have to throw the ball in and go with play action. They brought the tight end from the play side all the way over. Nobody picked him up, but I thought we might see that a little bit earlier from Zach Taylor. They save it for the right time, and it comes up for a touchdown. Burrow now 287 yards.
