 Mucci's in some half. Stevenson, nice tackle behind the line of the scrimmage. Edmonds didn't buy the fake right there to make it third down, third and one. Not only did he not buy the fake, Connor McDermott trying to get up to him, he just went right around him. His instincts and quickness, McDermott didn't have a chance. Patriots let a few seconds run off the clock. Could have stopped it at around 39 or 40 instead of 34. And Matt, Patricia, there is no real offensive or named offensive coordinator, but Patricia, who, of course, his pedigree is on defense, is in effect their offensive de facto offensive coordinator. I found it interesting when we sat down yesterday with Mack. He was talking about how, yeah, Patricia's doing a great job. It's more of a collaborative effort. He's involved now in his second year. He said, but Bill Belichick is more involved, obviously. He goes to the meetings. He's around and definitely trying to offer any kind of help he can to this group. There's Joe Judge, a big part of it as well. Former head coach of the Giants. Third down and one from the 35-yard line. Patriots with one timeout. Now you've got Jones. And now they've got to get to the line of scrimmage. Want to save that timeout. They must have called a timeout from the sideline there. Well, so much for saving the timeout. It'll be first down at the 33-yard line. We'll go back to how they got this football. Look at him bend, go underneath, keep his balance, and then finish. That almost looks like a combine drill. Those edge pressure guys who can get down underneath. Look at the hands. He shoots the hands, but he misses because of that quickness and that ability to dip under. So no timeouts at the 33. And the Bills will get the ball to start the second half. The Patriots trying to cash in. and that pass is along the sideline of the 19-yard line. Devontae Parker, incomplete. Couldn't haul it in before he was out of bounds. Tredavious White with the coverage on the play. Got the left foot down but unable to get the right foot down in bounds. Makes it a little tricky with 26 seconds now without that timeout. It was interesting, that timeout strategy was not New England-like. Second down and ten. And that's caught on the outside and getting out of bounds to stop the clock. Hunter Henry for Davies White with the coverage on the plate. 22 seconds now, third and six. Just a reminder for Mac Jones, if they don't pick up this first down, you stay in bounds. You know, the clock's going to be moving, and you don't want to fire it to kill the clock. So this is an interesting time here, this third and six. If you don't get out of bounds and you complete it, you've got to get up to the last block, because you can't spike it until you throw it down, assuming you don't get the first. Exactly. Jones, look out from behind. Throws and just throws it away. The crowd doesn't like that. It's going to be fourth down, and in comes the field goal group. Well, I think he's looking at Taron Johnson there, who was in coverage, but sitting there waiting for the threat of Jones to take off, and instead of trying to take him on without any timeouts, he ends up just throwing it away and settling for the field goal. And a 48-yard attempt here for Nick Folk. A timeout taken by Buffalo. You know, yeah, we're so used to seeing such judicious use of timeouts by New England. That was very odd. Letting the clock run for a few extra seconds before they took the timeout, then taking another timeout instead of maybe spiking it. Yeah. I thought they would have saved that last one. The numbers you just saw. according to next-gen stats powered by AWS. Our numbers were powered by nothing. 48-yard attempt for Fulk. And he boots the season, of course, for Kansas City. Ty digs his career high. Good play. Thinks it's great ball handling, among the other things Allen does so well. Yeah, and those two work so much together. They're in sync. And when they see one-on-one, you know 17's going to look 14 up. And he had great opportunity there. Pushed it to the inside. Flipped his corner Jones and just able to pull away pretty easily. Ken Dorsey, by the way, is a play caller. Really good job of keeping his patience and running the football. Much of that drive. Here's Marcus Jones who scored the touchdown from the two-yard line. And gets followed up at the 18-yard line. Late flag. Call in a moment from Sean Hockley. As Jones in the offense comes back out in the early moments. And a little pushy-shovey going on in the middle of the field. As there is so often on special teams. A little kissy face. Yeah, a little energy. Shaq Lawson actually got involved in that a little bit. During the return, holding return team number 97. The penalty is half the distance to the goal. It's first down. Once again, a look at the standings in the East. Everybody over .500. Miami and San Francisco this week. And Buffalo for the moment trying to assume the top spot. Playing this one extra game on this Thursday night to go to a mark of 9-3. Again, we talked about it at the top. They have three losses this season by a combined eight points. Kevin Harris is now the running back. A rookie out of South Carolina. He takes it and gets slammed down as he reaches the line of scrimmage. taken down there by Shaq Lawson. Shaq Lawson along with an inside move against the tight end Hunter Henry. It's good to see Tremaine Edmonds back in this lineup, too. You see Edmonds back in the back, but 90 orcs to the inside. Edmonds closing. Nowhere to go there for Harris. Got to keep an eye on it over the right tackle, Greg Rousseau. With Von Miller out, 50 is going to be the guy that's going to have to really step up his game as a pass rusher. second and 11 look out and jones with a flag thrown that time it's lawson again coming in and taking him down i think the left guard cole strange is going to be called for a holding call not to mention potential intentional grounding i i don't know where in the heck mac jones is trying to throw this football of course the bills would like a safety here but he was definitely in the field of play when he let it go. They're definitely going to get to left guard. Cole Strange. There was two fouls by the offense on the play. Holding number 69 in the field of play. This penalty's declined. Intentional grounding, number 10 offense. This foul also began in the field of play. It's a loss of down at the one-yard line. It's third down. Right. Had he been in the end zone and an intentional grounding, it would have been two points. Instead, now you've got a third down and 18. And you see the right guard, 69. He's going to get a hold. You've got your left tackle, Trent Brown, that's trying to undercut Shaq Lawson. Misses him, and it makes it easy for him to get in there and apply that pressure. Wouldn't have mattered with the holding call, but see him diving there to try to block Lawson. That's not a quick pass. I mean, typically you're trying to undercut Submarina guy. If the ball's coming out fast, not a long developing play. Right now they need to give Pilardi some room if they're going to punt. And instead, yeah, he's going to have plenty of room right now because it's almost the first down is Stevenson. Leading 18 appears to get 17 out to the 17 or 18 yard line. So fourth and ones. Pretty simple duo call. A couple double teams up front. and it gives you an idea of what Stevenson can do. Great job there. Boy, Strange came right back after that holding call. Had a really nice block up to the backer. It sprung that loose. Pines came over from the Colts a month ago. And Pilarity now with his second punt. His first one, 38 yards. play clock ran out they're down by 10 already i mean the bills have owned them over the last two years of course it sort of coincided with a guy named brady leaving town yeah remember the patriots had won 11 straight division titles now the bills have won the last two and in position to make it three yeah and what they've done tonight is they've been able to run the football it's been a very balanced attack and you look at the two drives and they've been able to put points on a board, 14-play drive and a 9-play drive. Yeah, this is big, down 10 early in this game. This is a big drive for both teams. Allen's going to keep it and go nowhere. They converge on him after a short game. Dietrich Wise in on the play, so it's third down and eight with 3.45 left in the half. Sure, one of the things that Bill Belichick and that defensive staff is talking to these players about is being stronger at the point of attack. You know, the Bills' offensive line has really been pushing them around in the interior. And they've been better here these first couple plays. Allen. Protection holding up. Secondary does its job. Fires deep downfield into a lot of traffic. A lot of contact there, but no flag and incomplete. Intended for Diggs, who is well covered on the play. 4,000. Great coverage downfield. And they bring five. It's picked up. Eventually gets flushed. Almost look at this like he's thinking maybe I'll get past interference. Worst case, it's intercepted, but it's like a punt on third down and long. So he just puts it up in the air and kind of hopes for the best. Speaking of punts, hey, it's been two and a half games that these teams have met, and we finally see a Buffalo punt. The last two games, no punts. Sam Martin, who hasn't even had to shower after the past couple of games, finally gets into the action, and it's a low line drive that takes a great bounce for Buffalo and is stopped at the 15-yard line by Marcus Jones. Hardly a work of art, but it's good for 54 yards. He's the master at me. Well, that's deflected and rolling out of bounds intended for Stevenson. Connor McDermott is in for Cajust on that right side and tried to cut down Rousseau. And I'll tell you, Rousseau has that length. It's 6'6". And just with that wingspan, he's just able to put his left hand out there and knock the ball down. See, 50 right there. Doesn't get cut. and gets that ball knocked down. He's got his hand on it. Incomplete pass. Marcus Jones is in on offense, and here he is again. Up to the 18-yard line he goes, Taron Johnson. And they're trying to get the ball out into the flat these last two plays to make Tredavious White have to make a tackle. But good job by this defense running, especially the slot corner, Taron Johnson. Remember, Tredavious, Wyatt had the ACL last Thanksgiving. He's worked his way back. Last week had 16 snaps and a couple possessions. Really didn't have to do much, and tonight's still in the game, which is great to see. Even though he spent a little time in the tent, they checked him out, but he's back in now. Third down and seven. Jones, that deep drop throws, and that's incomplete along the sideline. Coverage is good right there, intended for Jacoby Myers. First time he's been targeted tonight. and New England is now 0 for 4 on third down, fourth and seven. Now the frustrating thing there is for Matt Jones and these wide receivers is you want to get the depth, go a yard or two beyond the first down marker. Even if he catches this, he's short by a yard or two. Crowd wants pass interference after looking at the replay. Meanwhile, Pallardi now, his fourth punt of the night. and taking over until Jake Bailey is ready to return for his back injury. And a pair of catches made at the 44 by Hyde. Monitor and see Terry McCauley nodding up and down with his head, meaning, yeah, they could have called that one. So the Bills maybe catch a break there. And the Bills take over at the 43-yard line. Allen over the middle starting to stumble. Is Cook. Is able to pick up eight. And that takes us to the two-minute warning with one finger. On this 34-degree night. Allen back to throw. And that's caught at the four digs. From the 48-yard line. Up the middle going nowhere goes Devin Singletary. Jabril Peppers makes the stop. So up front, you've got David Quisenberry starting at that left tackle spot, normally occupied by one Deion Dawkins, one of the best in the league. Actually, it looks like he's maybe limping here early in the game too. Just all he needs, right? Yeah, exactly. But, you know, with Quisenberry in for Dawkins, and remember, Morris is back in at center, which moves Ryan Bates back to the right guard spot. But they're protecting him early, but they've not been blitzing. A lot of zone. Meanwhile, the throw is low, and that's Gabriel Davis. Does not come up with it. It's incomplete. Marcus Jones covering on the play. Taking a third down and 11 for the Bills. Judon that time, right as you talked about the left tackle, Quesenberry. Judon that time who leaves the NFL in sacks with 13 actually came late and got right by Quesenberry. That's a heck of a matchup to watch throughout the night. Third and 11. They go empty here. Allen. And he throws a little shot put pass to Hines. Was he over the line of scrimmage is the question. I don't think he was. I think this should hold up. The ball's out. He's well behind the line of scrimmage. Remember, if any part of his body at all is behind the line, he's good. By the way, what a flip. What a vision. What a job of just flipping that out there with the vision. Instead of setting himself up, he didn't have time. He just flips it out. 21-yard game. Fires here. That's Diggs making his second grab. And our first flag of the game comes in. Sean Hockley is tonight's referee. And already the Bills are moving backwards. Pass interference. Offense number 14. It's a 10-yard penalty. Replay first down. This comes off the ball here against Jonathan Jones. and you'll see him well patented with a nice big strong push there, pushes Jones out of coverage and a good call there by the officials. One thing about Diggs, you don't realize how physical he can be as a wide receiver. He makes so many explosive plays, but if you really study him, he is a strong guy at that time, too strong as he gets the interference call. Back to the 38-yard line, first down and 20. Singletary. To the 33. So Brian Dable was the offensive coordinator, now the head coach of the New York Giants. Ken Dorsey had been the quarterback's coach. Makes the transition now to offensive coordinator, but that's about as seamless as it's going to get when you change coordinators. Yeah, it's been interesting watching him, though. Like anybody who calls plays for the first time, it's been a process for him. But in his fourth year in this system, he knows it, and it seems like he and Josh Allen every week get more and more comfortable with how they're attacking. Second and 15. Stepping up, stepping away. In trouble now. It's tackled at the line of scrimmage. Josh Uche was there. Pressure was put on again from Judon coming from the other side. It will be third down and 15. You and I both talked about Quessenberry being an interesting matchup you know right here and just trying to get out of his stance talked about how maybe he's not feeling 100% but obviously he loses his balance makes it pretty easy for Ruche to flush Josh Allen out of that pocket more importantly a good job by the entire defense eyes on the potential threat of Allen taking off and running and nobody exploits an open wound better than Belichick. Meanwhile, you got a flag here before the snap. Spencer Brown, the right tackle is moving. 12 start. Offense, number 79. Five-yard penalty. It's third down. Makes it third down and 20. They just activated John Brown John Smoke Brown has been around the league for a while The piece First and ten now at the 44 yard line Stevenson again Look at this Look at this talking about yards after contact. If you're second only to Derrick Henry, you know you moved the pile. I mean, two of the last three runs that he has had, I mean, they're beautiful. They're old school, physical. You've got, I mean, you've got some great players, but the problem is look how high they're going in on him. They're trying to rip the ball out. Somebody better grab those big legs to bring him down. Six feet even, 246. is the second-year man from Oklahoma. To the outside. Flag thrown again. Tackled by Epinesa. Another tackle by David Andrews to center, which is where the holding call is. Yeah. Oh, man, they had a good drive. They were staying ahead of the sticks, and now they'll get behind the sticks after this. And let's say declining. Offense. This penalty's declined. You're right. He's checking down. The number was 60-0 with the hold. They had some success getting between the tackles. You see Edmonds. They said, let's get there. There's the hold right there. Pretty obvious. Trying to get the ball outside. Away from some of that pressure from those backers. But that defense flows too quickly. Yeah, it was a four-yard loss. So they take a second and 14 instead of a first and 20. Meanwhile, Jones barely escapes. Throws. And that is picked off at the sideline. Was he inbounds? As the officials look at each other. And that is Jordan Poyer right in front of the Buffalo bench. And now the two officials converge. A third one gets into it as well. And it's ruled as an interception. Yeah, he got both down right and then the left. and control. Great play. Great closing speed. Now they might watch the ball when he hits the ground just to make sure he secured it. But he definitely got his feet down. Good job of getting him flushed out of the pocket. Epinesa did a nice job. Good to see him back and healthy. Fifth interception of the season. And now all of a sudden... I thought the ball might have come loose when he hit the ground. After reviewing the play, the defender did not serve on the ground. There you go. You can see it move. It's third down. See it? Incomplete. There it was. And, of course, the Patriots were hurt the other night in Minnesota on a similar play at the goal line, offensively, obviously, with Hunter Henry. Yeah, yeah. The ball coming out after it hit the ground. Had to look at that one several times. Here you could see the ball. He loses control there slightly. Hamlin right away put his hands on his head saying, oh, no. But what incredible job there by Jordan Poyer. Saw it coming the whole way, baited it, stepped in front of it, and made the play. But he just unable to hold on to it. They better help these tackles here on this third down. This pass rush is becoming way too much for Mac Jones and his offense to handle. Third down and 14 now. Over the middle. Caught at the 48. And Jacoby Myers can only get to the 44-yard line. Matt Milano making the tackle there. So, fourth and nine. Well, again, they're down 10. to me it feels like they're down by more. Yes, it does. They're within striking distance, ran the football well with Stevenson, and then got behind the sticks. And once that offensive line gets into those obvious passing situations, it's a problem. Michael Polardi now has fifth punt of the night. Bouncing way over the years. The Patriots play there early on. Patriots wearing those old throwback uniforms tonight. I love them. Came into the American Football League in 1960. This drive starts up at the 12. That's Nickerson Field, Boston University, and that's where they played their first game when they came in among the eight teams that came into the American Football League in 1960, then known as the Boston Patriots. When you think late 70s, early 80s, Patriots, what's the first player? Who's the first player you think of? Juno Capiletti. Less than four yards per play. 48 yards total on the drive. Can they make it pay off here? Allen running. And throws, and it's caught by Gabe Davis in the end zone. So Allen, did he run out of room? He got to the sideline. Maybe we have another flag, which is thrown at the one-yard line. Wow. So Mack Wilson was chasing him. Here's Hockley for the call. Before the pass was thrown, holding defense number 13. This penalty's declined. The result of the play is a touchdown. What a play. I mean, it looks like Allen's going to go out of bounds. He's chased. He's hassled. And he's able to get it away. It's incredible. He stays in bounds. And we see him often work to the right sideline. In fact, he's done it before the Patriots when he hit Dawson Knox. just goes airborne before he goes out of bounds and throws back against the grain. Every no-no there is known, and Big 17 can pull it off. Can there be a more dispiriting play for the defense? On the 14th play of a drive that goes only 56 yards, but they pay it off with a touchdown. Bass with the extra point, and that makes it 17-7. They're in L.A. next week. Raiders-Rams on Thursday night. A game by Josh Jacobs last week. He's having a heck of a year. Tremendous. See him. Back to this touchdown, Allen, and just appreciate the instincts. Here's Uche on the outside. He'll stunt to the inside. There's no pressure, but Josh Allen realizes once he makes that move, okay, I can get to the edge. Now you've got Mack Wilson who's got him right here because he's spying him. He sheds him, and then as he releases the ball, look back here. Jonathan Jones just gives up on the play You always hear that when you have a scrambling quarterback To plaster the receivers Meaning stick with them Jones did until he gave up on the last minute And that second of the play And here's the other Jones throwing And it's caught there by Jonathan Smith Edwards makes the tackle One more look at that throw by Allen What a play And just for good measure he's going to shake A big strong athletic linebacker Mack Wilson and throw it back In the air Davis. Look at him. Here he is. He just gave up. There it is. 31. Who had him man-to-man? Just gave up on the play. I think he's going out of bounds. Yeah. Stevenson. He can't go anywhere. And that's Edmonds again making back-to-back plays. Making it third down and long. Welcome back, Tremaine Edmonds. Man, is it good to see 49 in the middle of this defense. The leader. And watch how quickly he's able to diagnose what you put he and Milano in the middle These two linebackers are playing as well as anybody in the NFL but how quickly he gets downhill This is only New England 14th play of the half The Bills have run 31 On third and 10, Jones escapes, keeps his eyes downfield, fires, and that's incomplete. Intended for the tight end, Hunter Henry. So after that long drive that consumed about eight minutes for the Buffalo Bills, out go the Patriots in a minute and 14. A little stunt that caused some communication issues up front. The right guard, a winner who did not come over to help out on Rousseau, the end who was coming all the way around and flushed Jones out of the pocket. Pilarity with his third punt. Hines from the 25. Tackled up at the 29 by... He said he picked up on this. Now it's time for the Carfax 4K Sky Camp. He recognized the splits of Buffalo. And between the guard and the tackle, I just felt that they were maybe a foot wider than what would be considered normal in the NFL. And you can see what it does. It pushes those edge pressure. Defensive lineman edge guys out a little bit further where they can't get pressure on Josh Allen. And it also creates a lot more space for him to work within that pocket. And that had a lot to do, I guess, with maybe Dawkins being out and trying to... I think it's what they do. I think it's what they do. I think it gives Josh Allen, who is such a threat, you give him more space to work with, and he pushes those edge pressure guys out a little bit further. It's really effective when they decide to use it. Play action. Down fires, and it's almost picked off by Duggar. That would have been big. This is a big defensive series for the Patriots. Meanwhile, you've got Tyler Bass ready to kick off. Marcus Jones, who was the big hero in the game against the Jets with that punt return to win it. Back to receive. They were talking about wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour. That was yesterday's forecast. Right now, nothing even close. From the one, here comes Jones. and they corral him up at the 20-yard line and from there will Mac Jones coming off his best game of the season even though he lost to Minnesota on Thanksgiving night at the helm. 382 passing yards and a pass rating of close to 120 well above the league average. The thing that they did a much better job of is protecting him giving him time to throw, and they hit some big plays downfield against that Viking secondary. Ramondre Stevenson is the running back. Give it to him. Over the right side, he picks up a couple. So Stevenson is their leading ground gainer. He's also their leading receiver. He's caught 50 this season. He's in his second year out of Oklahoma, and he's really coming into his own. I feel like he could be a rising star in this league. I think he's starting to understand what it takes, taking care of his body in the offseason, really working much harder to understand the little nuances of playing the position. Send him out wide, bring him back into the backfield now on second down and eight. Four-man rush, Jones has time, fires caught up at the 30-yard line that's hauled in there by Devontae Parker, came over in a trade with Miami. Jacoby Myers takes away that nickel here. Nice little quick slant. Opens it up on the outside. There's a nice throwing lane. One thing about Mac Jones is I feel like I've watched a lot of these college quarterbacks transition up to the NFL. He processes things quickly and he's very decisive. You just got to give him time. Third and inches. They pack the line to the Bills and the ball's on the ground. Stevenson fumbles, recovers it. but they'll have to kick. So they came up just short on the second down play, short by inches. Then he fumbles on third down, and they'll punt after the three and out. It just looked like a miscommunication there with Mack Jones and Stevenson. You can see he comes straight back, and then he has to move to his right to try to get the ball in to the running backs. Not quite on the same page at a critical time here early in the game. Michael Polardi to do the punting Jake Bailey their regular punter on injured reserve with a back injury and the left footed kicker sends it down toward Hines who came over from Indianapolis he collects it to 33 and gets dumped immediately at the 32 yard line by Cardona meanwhile Josh Allen this season as we take a look at the numbers here second in the league in passing yardage about a 2-1 touchdown interception ratio the rating is above the league average and he's the team's leading rusher 561 rushing yards 5 rushing touchdowns just incredible challenge tonight for New England to try to not just deal with him in the pocket but if you play a lot of man-to-man which they do you have backs turned to him and he can hurt you with his legs and he loves to run over people even though Sean McDermott is not Particularly thrilled about that. Checks it down, and that's dropped. Never had control of it. Devin Singletary out in the flat. Couldn't hold on. Second down and ten. Keep in mind, the last two times this New England defense has gone up against Josh Allen and the Bills, twice, two games, they've not forced a punt. So, I mean, that's the kind of confidence Buffalo comes into this game with, and that's the head scratcher for Bill Belichick. And it starts not just with Allen, but where do you start with Stephon Diggs and his big playability. Do you use double teams? Do you play zone? Do you play man? They're going to have to try to figure that out early. In that playoff game last year, the Bills scored touchdowns on all seven possessions. Play action. Allen fires and finds the open man across the 50-yard line. That's Stephon Diggs. His main man to the 48, Kyle Duggar, makes the tackle there. That's a gain of 19 in the first down. Watch Knox work out to the flat. That's what will take your flat defender. So New England plans some zone. Flat defender has to respect that. And look at the throw going up and over. Right in between, actually, the corner. Duggar, who is holding and freezing with Knox. And there's that opening between the corner and the safety. And the arm strength, of course, of Josh Allen. 85th reception of the season to throw. So it's lower. He hits the upright. No good. And it bounces back. Hits the crossbar. Crossbar. So Fultz looked like he had it, thought he had it, and the next thing you know, comes up a yard short. And that was a mess on that series. Yeah. It is obviously very makeable within his range. I mean, it's great rotation end over end and just hits the crossbar. I was going to say, all things considered, to get it within a touchdown, the way this first half went. I already called it that way. I know. One possession game. Instead, it's anything but. Oh, yeah. You go back to special teams again. Yeah. Line, line, line, line. Allen fires. And that's incomplete with four seconds on the clock. Kyle Duggar. Broke it up. Of course, we all know what happened last week on Thanksgiving Day and how quickly he threw a missile downfield and got him into field goal range. With his arm strength, you always want to give him a chance, and now they'll shut it down. And take the ball when we start the second half. So, not a sound you hear at Gillette Stadium very often. 17-7 are halftime score. They seem to be starting deep in their own territory. They catch a break there with the Uche sack and fumble where they get some field position and have to settle for a field goal. Tristan Vizcaino, who was brought up just to kick off, sends this one only down to the 10-yard line, and it's run back by Hines out to the 25. Now it's time for tonight's game flow presented by Progressive. And if you're just tuning in, I'm sure you expected to see a lot of these kind of plays from Josh Allen. His creativity, using his legs, just in control. And when he's been flushed, he does what Josh Allen does. He's able to make plays by buying time, keeping his eyes downfield, and making some great throws. Allen to work from the 25-yard line. The running game has been more and more prevalent for Buffalo over the past few weeks, and that is, again, the case tonight as Singletary takes it for a game of about four. Honestly, you know, we're at halftime talking, as much as you want to talk about Diggs and Allen, because they're the superstars, to me, the thing I took away It was the job that Mitch Morse being back in the middle of this offensive line, Ryan Bates going back to his normal spot at right guard and how they've controlled things and opened up that running game. They've run it 19 times, thrown at 23. Reload, reload, reload. And the reload results in Allen shooting it to the right side. McKenzie makes the grab and picks up the first down jumping the play they almost picked it there but McKenzie able to make the catch and picks up the first down on a gain of 13 and again I continue to be impressed and I think it's been a big focus for Josh Allen people have been critical of that he's put the ball in the coverage in recent weeks and taken some chances with that competitive spirit tonight we've seen him checking it down and making really sound decisions with the ball in his hands. Up tempo it here. And that's caught at the 50-yard line. McKenzie with another catch. Takes it to the 40-yard line. Very rapidly, the Bills in New England territory. Yeah, they're being aggressive here. Miles Brand came off the slot. And again, Josh Allen sees that. Right away, the safety's deep. Gets the ball out of his hands quick. And McKenzie, when he's got space, knows what to do with the ball after he makes a catch. He's their leading receiver tonight. Five targets, five grabs, the 44 yards. And that's dropped. Singletary turning around just at the last moment. Could not hold on. It'll be second down to ten. He would have caught that. Dietrich Wise was out there. I think he's one of the more underrated players on this New England defense. Having a great year, 6'5", 275 pounds, has six and a half sacks coming into the year. See, he recognizes that, but they try to cut him. Quickly spins out of that, gets his eyes up, ready to make a play on Singletary if he makes that catch. James could have had trouble and picked up positive yards. First and 20 now. Fakes the throw. Then sets it up for Stevenson. Loses it again. And at the 47-yard line, it is corralled by the Patriots. So a couple of fumbles already. Tim Settle paused it. but the Patriots pounce on it. Here's the hit. How about Tim Settle hustling downfield? This is what you ask of your big defensive lineman on these screens, is chase it from the inside out, and he does that. Rhodes forces it back in, and that big hit by Settle at 315 pounds knocks it loose, but fortunately for the Pats, Aguilar is there to pick it up. That first fumble was actually charged to Jones on the handoff. Okay. So two fumbles tonight, one for each guy. And that's caught here. And Marcus Jones inside the 20. Marcus Jones down the sideline. Touchdown. So this guy plays special teams defense. And by the way, can play offense as well as you just saw. Well, Hamlin gets caught sitting back in coverage. See, he's back here. This is a run designed to go to the right. But with deep coverage and pressure here, good job of Mac Jones seeing it. Now just get it out there to a playmaker who can make the play after the catch. This is not common if you've not watched the Patriots. Like you said, he's a punt returner. He's a nickelback. But just like Bill Belichick, to put in a dynamic playmaker, just get the ball in his hands, and they do. That's his first snap on offense this season. You've got to love it. Won't be his last either. Nick Bulk with the extra point. And with 4.46 to go in the quarter, New England takes the lead. And how about the wrinkle, right? You always expect the unexpected with Bill Belichick in a big game in December. And there's a first example. Bynes, nice tackle in the open field. Brendan Schooler knocks him down. Back to the touchdown we go. Yeah, and a great job by Mack Jones of recognizing. Again, he's got an outside stretch play here. He sees pressure here. Not only that, he sees the depth of the safety, and he knows he's got a dynamic playmaker. So he gets out of that run real quick, makes that throw. Good effort by Parker, but with the quickness there at Jones, Parker didn't even need to make that block because he is so quick with his feet. The punt returner, who is so dangerous, as you said, Al, I think we may see 25 with another chance tonight on offense. or relatively quickly anyway relatively soon two-yard gain here starting to stumble is James Cook whose brother Dalvin which is the great Minnesota running back game of a couple second down and eight and he's got some real suddenness and big playability catch the ball out of the backfield he I think has a just a different gear of playmaking ability Quesonbury still in there left tackle again with Dawkins out they're really short handed up front second down and eight defensive line shifting around good protection this time throws a dart underneath that's caught and that's a first down up to the 35 yard line goes James Cook Stopped there by Jonathan Jones About 18 Joneses are in the game This is a great job by Josh Allen This is something that they've really stressed to him Sometimes he gets a little impatient Force the ball downfield They really want to see him Especially against this Belichick defense It's okay, check it down Whether it's Dawson Knox When you're checking it to Cook or Singletary We'll take those throws and those gains As positive yards all night Final three and a half minutes of the quarter. Pulley action. Look out. Gets it away. Dropped. Knox could not handle it. Make it second down and ten. This time it was Lawrence Guy getting a good push in the middle. They also brought fresher late with Duggar who ends up actually hitting Josh Allen right after the throw. You'll see him come through, but you also get a good push to the inside right there from Lawrence Guy. Watch to the left. Gets around the tight end, Knox, and boom! Makes that big hit right as he releases the ball. Allen is taking a few. 6'5", 237, but durable. Mentioned before, likes to run through people, likes to run over people in the game. Hurdles. Here's Cook. Stopped up at the 35-yard line by Miles Bryant. Bryant taking the spot. There's Steve Belichick who does call the defensive signals. Meanwhile, you've got Brown who just rejoined the team. Wide to the right, bottom of the screen. Four-man rush. Allen hangs in the pocket, throws underneath. It's caught and taken to the 30-yard line as Gene's Cook, their number two running back. So they get to the 30, fourth and long, and in comes the field goal unit. This is going to be a big story tonight. It's Uche again who has great quickness. and throughout this game you've got to be able to take care of Josh Allen's blind side when you can get pressure with just rushing forward allows him to sit back and play zone and keep eyes on Allen and the potential threat of his scramble Tyler Bass a 48 yard attempt very little win and the kick is right down the middle opening drive for the Buffalo Bills results in a field goal they take an early three problem, they're taping the ankle and that is bad, bad news for the Buffalo Bills put him out on the edge, remember he played with the Tennessee Titans last year and when he played most often he was in at right tackle now because of necessity he's playing left tackle and you know it's an issue and I think it's really impacted Josh Allen in recent weeks having this offensive line not been able to take care of him. And you saw it on the opening drive. Two yards deep. It'll be down in the end zone there by Marcus Jones. By the way, in case you forgot, Tom Brady was here for a while. Left the Patriots in 2020. 97 TD passes. Third most in the league since he moved down to Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, 47 touchdown passes. His third fewest in the NFL for the guys that have succeeded him, including Mac Jones. Of course, you had Cam Newton here as well. Brian Hoyer. But Tom just keeps rolling along. I'm a believer in Mac Jones. We can talk about him throughout this night. Oh, you've watched him a long time. Yeah. And the catch is made here. Hunter Henry, the tight end. And they will spot that one. just a little bit shy of the first down. I was impressed when he verbaled and committed to Alabama. I remember Tua Tagovailoa had already committed to play for Nick Saban, and instead of backing down and saying, okay, if Tua's going there, I'm going somewhere else, he took on that challenge. And then I watched him as a young quarterback behind Jalen Hurts and Tua, and nobody talked much about him, and he would tear up the first-team defense down on the scout team. And so he gained the respect over time, and eventually won a national title his last year at Alabama. Second and one. And this will be a first down for Stevenson. Take a look at the quarterback room in Alabama. He had Jones, Hurts, and Tungabailoa all in the same quarterback room. Of course, Saban and Belichick are great friends, so I'm sure Nick had a lot to do with the fact that Bill drafted Jones, and he was that heralded class. He was the fifth quarterback pick. Yeah, yeah, it's incredible. I did a lot of work with that class, and it was one thing that I walked away from with Mac Jones is his ability to process coverage and make quick decisions. He worked with Steve Sarkeesian, who was an NFL offense coordinator when he was in Atlanta, and I think it just helped him to be able to make the transition to the NFL quicker. Here comes the blitz. They pick it up, and it is at the 45-yard line, Nelson Aguilar making the grab. It was Jordan Poirier who came in from the corner putting the heat on. and Aguilar gets free and picks up the first down. He's off to the right here. He's just going to kind of work across the middle, and when you get those linebackers cleared out, Mac Jones has time to throw. Good job by Stevenson stepping up in there and giving him the time. We saw what he could do last week when he threw for 382, and I think he's gaining confidence with the people around him, which always allows quarterbacks to play better. Starts out three for three. Pressured here, and he will take off to the 47 he goes and he flagged those thrown and it's going to bring it back it'll be against the Patriots holding offense number 77 it's a 10 yard penalty replay first down that's Trent Brown battling an illness there was some question whether he'd be active tonight but he is but call for the penalty here Boogie Basham one on one on the outside This is another matchup, I think, with the tackles of New England against this pass rush, even without Von Miller, right? As he pulls out of there, grabs on briefly to that shoulder pad and the jersey. Got a hold of that jersey. Even got a hold of the face mask. Mack Jones was actually out. He's got so many hybrid players, meaning he's got linebackers and safeties, and they all do so many different things. It puts a lot on the offensive staff, the quarterback, and the offensive line to try to identify what they're doing. It takes, like I said, two or three series. Here's Cook. Finding his way. Close to a first down there. Spencer Brown pulling and leading the way for him. Setting up a third and two. Pulling a lot of these offensive linemen, especially on the edges with the tackles. Brown and Quezenberry trying to get these linemen on the move. continue to be in these third and comfortable situations for Allen. Bring in an extra lineman. Bobby Hart here in the 21-yard line. Singletary is the running back. And Singletary is able to pick up the first down. Moving the ball to the 19-yard line with a little less than nine minutes to go in the first half in Foxborough. And here's the game within the game. You know, New England wants to see if they can hold up in this red zone. You know, you're not going to give up those big plays the best that you can against Stephon Diggs and Gabe Davis and Isaiah McKenzie. And now this becomes the game. Can Allen, who's had some struggles in the red zone, can they make plays down here? Diggs hits up wide to the right. Keep it on the ground here. Cook. Cook tonight. Carried seven times for 49 yards. Well, this right side, especially the interior, it's good to see Mitch Morse back. But you see Bates come down, help with the double team. Then you get the right tackle here, Spencer Brown, getting up to that second level. Off the double team, up to the backer. great execution right now. I asked Joe Brady, I said, how do you get better with the red zone? The big thing they say is, we've got to run the ball. We can't just put it all on Josh Allen in the passing game. Second and four. Put, and they continue to run the ball. Of course, when they run the ball, it also means Allen can run it as well. Oh, yeah. He can also do a boot or a naked and get around the corner where he's really dangerous. But again, we get to these third and shorts. Jones staying warm on the sideline. Buffalo has a 2-1 time of possession advantage. Had the ball for nearly 16 minutes thus far. Cook stays in the backfield on a third down and three. Pass to the outside. That's caught from McKenzie, and that'll be a first down. Jonathan Jones is there to make the tackle. So Allen has moved them to a first and goal situation, completing eight of his first 12 now for 84 yards. Great job of getting an indicator with Isaiah McKenzie going into man-to-man. Snap the ball while he's on the inside. Use those two outside receivers as almost a wall where he can work to the outside and make that corner who trailed him. Jones have to work through those other receivers to get to him. Well-designed play there on third and short. The ground again. Hines, nothing doing. Judon there to make the tackle at the line of scrimmage from the eight-yard line. It will be second down and goal. Good job by the rookie. Jones getting off of Diggs. he gets upfield and then you've got Judon who's able to clean it up nowhere to go to the outside there with the speed of Hines defense once they set that edge is able to chase that play down 13th play of the drive they run it 8 of the prior 12 out of the air thrown and incomplete Gabe Davis trailed by Jonathan Jones. Couldn't get there. It was third down and goal. Remember, into that boundary, we saw Diggs score that touchdown with that same matchup against Jonathan Jones on the exact same route. He doesn't quite sell it as good as Diggs did to the inside, but he still had separation. This is who New England feels most confident putting out on an island, but there's the separation. The ball just thrown a little bit too far to the outside. Third and goal. One of those rare drives, 13 plays with a wrap. Delay of game. Offense. Five-yard penalty. It's fourth down. Yeah, last week's special teams really, it's uncharacteristically hurt New England. Probably cost them the game. Shocking in a way. Yeah. They've always been so good. Of course, they're spearheaded by Matthew Slater in his 15th season. It's always been a hallmark of the Patriot teams. And again, a penalty here cost them five. So it's fourth down and seven and the punt fair catch 4-4 made at the 44 yard line by Hines. I mean, this is a tradition the league started a few years ago. Great thing. And the players have really bought into it. Yeah. We talked to Devin McCourty He kind of got excited to talk about it I mean it really like you said the players are not just excited about their causes excited to share them you know what they behind From the 44, Allen dancing, throwing, and having a tough time tracking it was Gabe Davis. He got ahead of Jack Jones. It's incomplete. Second and ten. And going after the rookie with a little double move, a little stuttering go by Gabe Davis, who is known for his ability to get downfield. A little hesitation by him. See, Jones bought it. Usually when a corner gets caught up like that, Josh Allen makes him pay for it, but I don't think Gabe Davis ever saw the football. When he does, he gains about 20 yards on average. Hand off here. Singletary. And he's able to pick up the first down before Jonathan Jones stops him. Picks up 11 yards. We talked with the Buffalo offensive coaches. They said, you know, they really feel Devin Singletary is underrated. Low center of gravity. Has some wiggle, as you saw right there. Great vision. Ken Dorsey loves the combination of Singletary and the rookie Cook coming along in this latter part of the season now. Give it to him again. Seems very fourth year with the Buffalo Bills. Third round pick out of Florida Atlantic. 2019. Anytime you play Bill Belichick, you're always going to have to deal with some surprises. It takes you a while to kind of figure it out. There's Godshaw in the middle. It's a great battle of strength in the inside. But it takes you a series or two. One thing I think Ken Dorsey's as good as Josh Allen is, with the safeties back, he's being patient, running the football. Hook this time Taking that here The tackle setting up a third and short Makes sense if you're Bill Belichick and his defensive staff Don't give up the explosives Make Josh Allen be patient Make them run the ball Keep in mind New England's red zone defense in the top ten They're seventh in this league So they'd rather make them go the long way and try to squeeze them in the red zone. It's pretty much a league-wide trend this year. Everybody giving you the short stuff to take away the deep stuff, the explosive play, third and three. Allen, and that's caught at the 30-yard line. The pressure was put on that time by O'Shea. Isaiah McKenzie makes the catch. So Allen throwing, going backwards, able to pick it up. Like you said, he's falling back. It gives you, again, a good indication. The routes run right here. Good indication of how strong his arm is. Left tackle concerns continue, but he's able to recognize that and get the ball off. Well, I really thought McKenzie potentially got up before he was touched. He did too. Yeah. But just flips that ball with his wrist and throws it 15 yards. Oh, there it is. Yep. goes with nine first downs set up a screen here McKenzie nothing happening, closing quickly making the tackle right there make it second down and eight and the Bills, you're talking about that defense through the years, Luchin Belichick he can do any number of things sometimes two defensive linemen nobody with their hand on the ground Cook now in the backfield on second down and ten. Cook has it. Escapes the tackle. Gets banged down about three yards shy of the first down. And a flag on the play. Sean Hockley gives us the call momentarily. Illegal block in the back. Offense number 13. It's a 10-yard penalty. Replay, second down. Pulling that one on Gabriel Davis. Going to make it second down and 20. He was coming in on a crack block as Kyle Duggar was trying to come up and run support. Just pushed him in the back. Sean McDermott, sixth year Hard to believe They didn't make the playoffs Between 99 And 2016 And when Sean got there Now four times in five years You'd expect five out of six, right? At this point, yes Right Second and 18 Allen's going to take off Looking for the sideline And gets there, forced out by Uche to make it third down. It was second and 18. Well, when you play man-to-man, you've got to have a guy that can keep an eye on the quarterback in Allen when he drops back to throw. And that's Juwan Bentley who's got to be able to stay with him. See, the rest of this defense, the speed of Uche is able to catch up to him. But that's the danger there, of course, with Allen. It's not just those throws he can make. Keeps Giannis with the X factor in his legs. Third and 11. Plenty of time. And the pass is dropped. Diggs is there. Jones covering on the play. And so that will make it fourth down and 11. This is what you want. You get to third down and long, and you've got Jones matched up against Stephon Diggs. Look at that. Look at the cushion there. A little push at the top. Comes back. Happens to lose his balance. And I think that may have affected his vision on the football. That's a completion and a first down. You see the frustration on Josh's face as he looks at the replay. Meanwhile, here is Sam Martin's punt, which bounds into the end zone. So Jones and company take over the next three games. They want them to get completely healthy. Meanwhile, this drive starts with a pass to Nelson Aguilar for a gain of six. I think that's a smart move. You know, this is a team that's going to go into the postseason, and you obviously want your best pass rusher and one of the leaders of your team healthy. Give it four weeks, give him a chance to recover, see if he's ready to go, and see what this team can do with him back on that back end of this schedule and into the postseason. What's Stig's doing talking about what happened on that last play? On second down and four. Breaking tackles, which he does a lot. Stevenson, second in the league in yards after contact. Derek Henry on the ground. Go to Kaylee. Well, Al, the damage to Von Miller's right lateral meniscus This is on the same knee that he had ACL reconstructive surgery on back in 2013. So this injury will directly affect his full-speed bending and twisting, which is exactly what he does when he rushes the quarterback. So if Miller avoids surgery, he will have to strengthen the muscles around the knee and likely wear a brace for support. But as you guys recognized, Brandon Beans said putting him on the IR now gives him the best opportunity to return for the stretch run. It does, and of course the stretch run is going to include the playoffs. This is the flag coming here after the run by Stevenson. He is a load coming through. Holden, defense number 92. This five-yard penalty will be added to the end of the play. That on Daquan Jones. 92 right in the middle. See that good push there on a double team. and he's grabbing onto the jersey of David Andrews. The center pulls him down. But Stevenson, back-to-back physical runs, keeping his balance. Handful of penalties on both teams tonight. Five out of Jalen Mills, who's enacted tonight. Third down and nine. Imagine the pride of this defense and how embarrassed they were in that wild card game. All week, here locally, the media talking about, Man, the last two times, coach, you've played against Josh Allen, you haven't even forced a punt. You don't think they've heard that all this week? Showing up tonight with a bit of a chip on their shoulder. And in a huge game for them. Yes. Trying to stay alive in the playoff hunt. Allen rolling and throwing and falling down and drawing the flag that time. Is Gabriel Davis covered there by Jack Jones? and the penalty will go against New England. Pass interference. Defense number 13. The ball will be placed at the spot file. First down. It's unfortunate for the rookie out of Arizona State. He loses his footing, which causes this interference. He loses his balance right there, and then just his arms get tangled up with Davis on that out cut. It's a big third down and a big penalty there against the rookie. Yeah, it was third down and nine. 22-yard penalty at the 43 now. Two and a half to go in the first quarter. Cook stays in it running back. Gets it again. Through the middle. Great run to the 15-yard line. Tackled by Jack Jones. Tommy Sweeney, one of their tight ends, leads the way. A gain of 28 for Cook. How about Ryan Bates and Spencer Brown? Watch the push. Just clean it, wash it all the way down. Nice big hole. You get them tied in. Also, Sweeney involved. And that's what I talked about with the back, the rookie, Cook. You get him running downhill. He puts a lot of pressure on those safeties trying to come up into run support. Keep it on the ground. Cook for a couple. second and eight. Josh Allen can get some running game going between the tackles with Cook or if Singletary comes in there. As we know, that's where he is just so dangerous, where he gets under center and they get their play-action game going, where he can get around the edge on a boot. Now he's got a chance to run or he's got a chance to throw. That's what affects the eyes of those safeties and those linebackers when the Bills get that running game going. Seventh play on the drive. They've run on four of the first six. Hand off. Instead, it is Allen keeping it after faking it to Hines. And through the middle, he goes. Of course, he's, as we mentioned before, the team's leaving rusher to set up a first down and goal. They do action to the left, but he's got both the left tackle and the left guard pulling around. They get extra blockers on that right side. I just love his competitive spirit. He can't help himself. He'll tell you, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I've got to slide. Yep, I've got to get out of bounds. Then he goes airborne like that. With great success, too, almost always. First and goal. This time he hands it up. And Heinz is taken down. Back of the line of scrimmage, Jack Jones. And that will probably take us to the end of the first quarter. So the second quarter will begin with a second down and goal. Second down and goal as we begin the second quarter. Singletary back in as the running back. knocks in the backfield as well the tight end play action fires caught digs for the score we were talking during the break about how digs looked like he was getting a little frustrated and sure enough takes all the four seconds to get him into the end zone i think buffalo sense that he was getting frustrated too. Ken Dorsey and Josh Allen said, hey, let's get the ball to our guy. One-on-one matchup, and he just turns Jonathan Jones around. Now, Jones has moved from that nickel spot where he was great the last few years. Now he's on the outside. What a route again by Stephon Diggs to get open and get that separation. Tenth touchdown catch of the season for Diggs. Extra point by Bass is good. 10-7 Buffalo and we're back in 30 seconds. He decatches for him. Time for second most in the league. Kelsey is on top. Having a fantastic... I think it's Steve Grogan. Okay. Stanley Morgan. Stanley Steamer during the 80s. Second down and four from the 12-yard line. Allen fires. That's caught. That'll be a first down. Gabe Davis. Robert Kraft has owned this team since the mid-90s. There he is with Andy Jassy, our ultimate boss over at Amazon. And the gang are checking out tonight's action. We're in that suite yesterday for our production meetings. It's, as you'd expect, a beautiful setup. And fine sushi as well. What else is new? from the 19-yard line. First down. Seven minutes remaining in the third. Allen. Off-balance throws caught. Tackled at the 21-yard line is James Cook. Josh Allen limping a little bit after that play. I don't know if he stepped up and had a little bit of pressure. and it was a good job that time by Wise getting in there and it forced him to have to step up and kind of collided there. He's had an elbow issue. We haven't talked about it. Yeah. Here he's kind of limping a little bit. We asked him about the elbow. He said, oh, I'm fine. It's like it's mind over matter. You don't want to address it. Here's Cook. But when he plays, as we know, it's not just when he scrambles and runs. But he plays a physical game. And he takes hits. He's a big body. He's a big target. These guys know that, hey, you get a shot on 17. You take it and put him to the ground. Meanwhile, he's throwing himself into harm's way. Just that style of football that he plays. Look at that. Not just a fumble, but he falls awkwardly on the ground. In the first replay, you saw him hit right elbow directly on the ground. And he's played through everything. Been indestructible. Third down and three here. Dancing. Surveying. And it's holed in by Stiggs. What a catch. Contested catch. Jonathan Jones is right there. Couldn't stop it on the flag. Now down to the 36-yard line. I think they may have Jonathan Jones on a defensive hold. 31. Which they'll decline and take that completion. Good for 19 yards. Diggs against Jones. What a battle. Diggs is so tough to stay with. Decent number 31. His penalties declined. The result of the play is a first down. Even with the hold, he's able to get away from him. How about the accuracy? What a throw again by Josh Allen. Those two almost looked like they could close their eyes and be in sync. Yeah. You know, they just had such a rhythm together. Came over in a trade a couple of years ago with Minnesota. From the 44-yard line. Back to the ground they go. Actually, their passes and runs very, very well cooked for a gain of one. everybody wins in that trade that they made March of 2020 they got Diggs a 7th round pick Minnesota got a 1st round pick I didn't realize this you guys told me this morning turns out to be Justin Jefferson that's a win like you say everybody wins exactly Jefferson tops in receiving yards Cook stays in there second down and nine from the 45 yard line to the outside Diggs breaks away turns it into a nice gain to the 35 yard line so you've seen a lot of downfield shots, deep crossers so now you're going to be Diggs and you're going to go up against Jonathan Jones and again you're going to sell that, you're going by him You're gonna go by him you're gonna use your quickness and here I go boom foot to ground come back on that hitch And now he's got the strength to be able to pull away and that's the yards after the catch so not just downfield But after the catch underneath being able to break tackles Five catches for dig so far 73 yards and a touchdown Over the middle open making the grab picking up eight James Cook having a nice night. Ken Dorsey and quarterback coach Joe Brady have got to be really happy with what there's 41-yard line. Hauling it in there is Stephon Diggs. Jonathan Jones covering on the play. They continue to have that matchup with Diggs against Jonathan Jones. We wondered how would they try to defend Diggs. Would they have a safety over top? Would they bracket him? Would they leave Jones one-on-one? Remember, Jones was up against Justin Jefferson a week ago. He's gone up against Tyreek Hill in the opener. But tonight, he gets the assignment of Diggs and Diggs again with a good job of working that comeback. At the 41-yard line, four-man rush. Allen pressured. Luce got in there to hurry it up. Makes it second down and ten. You and I were talking about the last time Allen had the ball, how big of a series it might have been for the New England defense, down ten. And this one might even be bigger, under two minutes to go. New England, of course, had the ball first because Buffalo deferred. So they get the ball to start the second half. Looking for that two for one. Yes. Second and ten. Bills with all of their timeouts, 147. Allen, pressure, flag thrown. Going for it all. And it's Diggs in the end zone. Gets in front of Jones. And they're going to call a hold here on the offense. It was a 41-yard play, but that will go for naught because there's a hold on the offense. Yeah, I think the tight end on Chudon. How about the throw? I know it doesn't count. On the one. Offense number 89. It's a 10-yard penalty. Replay, second down. Tommy Sweeney, the tight end. Boy, it's two. Look at this throw. On the run. Ho-hum. 60 yards downfield right. So funny. I mean, I know it didn't count, but can we just sit back and appreciate this? And there's the result. So that goes by the wayside. Tommy Sweeney. who played his college ball up the road in Chestnut Hill at Boston College. Gets the penalty. Second down and 20 now from the 49-yard line. That's caught to the 41. Goes Shakir, his first catch of the night. Puts it down quickly. Gets up to the line of scrimmage, but the timeout is going to be taken here at the 41. We're back to Foxborough in 30 seconds. New England, electric does not want to see him go down the field, drain the clock, and score. Keep in mind, on that long throw that was brought back, they went after the rookie again, Jack Jones, who's off to the right at the top. Number 13, he backs up, gives Diggs a lot of room. Allen loses the ball. And the Patriots with Judon coming up with it with the recovery. Exactly what they needed. Uche came in. He forced it. Judon going to start the celebration, and that's exactly what New England needed at this point in the game. We go back to where you and I started on really the first play of the game with Deion Dawkins out. David Quezenberry against Uche, and this is a mismatch because of the quickness, especially in obvious passing situations. How about the bend? That was beautiful. I mean, he's quick. He's got great speed and burst, but to bend to get around Quezenberry, and then instead of worrying about the sack, he gets that right hand to jar that ball loose. Beautiful from the Michigan third-year player. Meanwhile, 15th giveaway by Allen. Fourth fumble to go with 11 interceptions. Meanwhile, great run. here by Stevenson to the 44-yard line. So the crowd very much back in it. Clock ticking down to a minute to go in the half. They have two timeouts through the Patriots. And finally, good field position. Let's see if they can do anything with it. That's their first first down since a second drive. Jones to the outside. That's caught. Myers makes his first grab of the night. Rose with the coverage. That'll make it second down and one with 50 ticks remaining. Good job seeing Mac Jones there really in sync. Gets the ball out of his hands quickly. And really nice to see Myers work back to the football there. Yeah, we all have. In a manner of speaking. Well, this team's going to be fun to watch now that we're into December. Josh Allen will continue to get that elbow healthy A little bit more rest for him Didn't seem to affect him tonight Didn't seem to hold him back at all What did you think? Yeah Thought he looked great Again, I thought Ken Dorsey and Sean McDermott The plan they put together offensively was fantastic It showed you the versatility It's not just about the big plays Tonight they were able to run the ball and control things up front And possess the football It's a tight-knit team. It would be a dangerous team down the stretch. And that will be the last play of the game. So they've now won three straight here in this, what has been through the years, a home of horrors for them. Come out in great shape in terms of the playoff hunt. Not so far in New England with a mark of 6-6. Is he somewhat cordially? I'm not quite sure how I want to describe that. I don't know. You know. It is what it is. Yeah, it is what it is. So 24-10 is the final score. And meanwhile, the Google Pixel postgame show coming up. right after these messages. The timeout. Khalil Shakir comes in in his spot. You saw Knox go out earlier. He's back in the game. Third and goal. Bill's trying to turn it into a potential three-possession lead. Singletary into the end zone he goes touchdown Buffalo so another time consuming drive they had the ball for nine minutes 15 plays nine of them runs we talked about the importance of the red zone and the Bills have taken advantage of it watch the job here by 71 the guard does a great job of Clearing it out. Godshall has no chance. Opens up. Spencer Brown, the right tackle, also is able to get up, make a good block. And three times they've been in the red zone, and three times they've come away with touchdowns. Tyler Bass for the point after. 29 seconds into the fourth quarter. The Buffalo Bills try to get to 9-3. 24-7, Buffalo. and Jones will run it back can he provide the spark up to the 28 yard line to start this drive you and I were just talking at the break saying this Buffalo team we've seen a bunch of teams they look really good of course they're a game out right now as far as having the top seed in the AFC if Kansas City trips once and they end up some way down the stretch here with a tie They win that head-to-head tiebreaker. Imagine them having home field throughout. They would be already a tough out. But, man, if they get home field throughout, good luck. Unless another storm comes in they got to play in Detroit That caught Great first down Catch made there by Kendrick Bourne. First time he has been targeted tonight. The former 49er picking up a first down here and a gain of 15. One of the things Bill Belichick said this week was how important a fast start was. And, you know, when you get into these obvious passing situations, you get behind Josh Allen. And you put your offensive line and your quarterback in a real tough spot where these defensive ends can just come after the quarterback. Well, that's where they are. Now 24-7 into the fourth quarter. See how they can hold up. The ball better get out pretty quickly by Mack Jones. Jones 12 of 19 for 124. Off the play fake. Throws. Errant pass intended for Jacoby Myers. Couldn't get to it in time. Boogie Basham, pretty underrated player, put the pressure on that time, second down and ten. Well, he's a different kind of pressure because he's big and strong and powerful at 280 pounds. So usually you see a guy at 255, 260 who's twitchy. He's got some speed. You can see the closing speed there, but he's going to beat you with power to be able to split those double teams like he did just there. Second and ten. Underneath. They read that perfectly through the Bills. Stephenson gets taken down by Jordan Poyer for a loss. Poyer was locked in and saw this coming all the way. He had Stephenson out of the backfield. If he leaked, you know, that was a big focus point with Stephenson last week, having nine receptions. Look at his eyes and how quickly he reacts. Such a leader in the back end of this Bills defense. No chance for that offensive lineman to be able to get out there in front of him. Winu. Third down and 15. Good protection. Myers. But he's stopped well short of the first down. Much to the consternation and frustration of this crowd. Fourth and seven. But they're frustrated because, like we saw earlier, these routes are not getting downfield to give them a chance at a first down. But imagine being Mack Jones. Look at everybody that you have downfield completely taken away. Only thing he can do really is check that down. Mike Pilardi's sixth punt of the night. Fair catch call for. Made by Hines at the 12-yard line. Seeing from Josh Allen with those underneath throws, but because of the job that they've done with Diggs over the years, makes people fear this offense downfield. And when you fear an offense and a quarterback with a big arm downfield, it creates a lot of openings underneath, and you get the ball to a guy like Singletary or Cook with space, you get a lot of positive yards. A little over three to play in the third. Second and two. Cook again to the 24-yard line. They keep bringing in Bobby Hart as another tackle has put him in as a tight end. And they're not hiding from the fact that they're going heavy and they're running behind it. maybe Dawson knocks maybe down and it is to an injury timeout to Favreau comes out you got Justin Murray who goes into play left tackle Favreau doing his best he's been showing a lot of heart from the first play just being out there gutting it out this is the 10th play of the drive coming at the 24 yard line Cook he goes to the 20 with a long drive had the ball for 6 minutes now I was going to say I think we came into this game thinking that it would be New England that would be trying to possess the ball with Mac Jones and instead it's McDermott and this offense doing an incredible job so far eating up clock, running the football and playing clean it's better than a 2-1 time of possession advantage and this will be their 59th play against 31 run by New England. Singletary is back in there. Got Tommy Sweeney as well in the backfield and they give it to Singletary who gets to the 18-yard line. Talking about Sean McDermott, before he got there, you had the barren period of almost two decades. He had two winning seasons between 2000 and 2016. No playoff appearances, no division titles. Nine coaches. Nine head coaches in that time. Right. He had four winning seasons in his first five. Four times to the playoffs. And likely a fifth one to come. Third down and four at the 18-yard line. Allen fires. And that's pulled in by Diggs again to the nine-yard line. He goes covered by the rookie Jack Jones. Now you've got Bobby Hart in there at left tackle. and look at this move right here by Uche. He's gone to the inside. Instead of using that speed to the outside, that's why Josh Allen, he sensed that. He knew he had to get that ball out quickly. Great job as well, as we continue to see by 14 digs. Sells it to the outside, comes back underneath on the rookie. So, again, those two in sync, even with that left tackle issue. Put the patience on that route by Stephon Diggs. Final minute of the quarter. First and goal from the nine. To the eight-yard line. Goes Cook. Second down and goal. Big battle in the middle tonight with Mitch Morris and Devon Godschau. Godschau that time won the battle. And you do not have to run a play. They can just take it to the other end of the field and start the fourth quarter with the Buffalo Bills on top of New England. 17-7. Looking on as their team is now down. At least the Kraft team is down by 10. Who knows who Jay-Z is rooting for. Second down and goal from the eight-yard line. Allen looking for the end zone and forced out of bounds by Devin McCourty at the one yard line This is the danger when you go against Josh Allen is you get outside of your rush lanes Uche, who's had a big night, goes wide and when you go wide against Josh Allen he senses it and does a good job of being able to step up he'll go up and then he'll go out How often have we seen that? And you're in man coverage, and there's no one there to pick him up. Up and out. And Uche, again, with that great speed, but just went too wide and upfield on that rush. So third down and goal. McKenzie was shaking up. That's the reason for the night, because of the way they've been able to run the ball. but he's made enough plays to give you that wow moment. Yeah, not necessarily a big night for him. It's still seven catches, 92 yards, and a touchdown. Yeah. A night that most guys would take. Yeah, for sure. Third down and six after the Buffalo timeout from the 28-yard line. Jones pressure avoids the sack and runs and he starts to slide a little bit short of the first down and he's slow in getting up so the mark at a yard shy he has to limp his way back to take the snap here it's fourth down and one good job of keeping that play alive I thought he was going to get sacked for big loss. Leave the yard and get about 10 on it as it's caught here by Thornton for a first down. And gets pressure by Wise right into his face and knows that he's got to put the ball up over the linebackers. That's why the ball sailed on him just a bit. But how about the rookie going up and making a great play? First down from the 11. Throws and Stevenson can't one-hand it Get a flag down in the Offensive backfield Holding Offense number 75 10-yard penalty Replay first down Connor McDermott Well they've been through the right tackles This is their fourth right tackle On the year It's Connor McDermott 75 matched up with Rousseau and just trying to keep him away from Mac Jones. First Patriots penalty of the half. Jones now for the end zone and the double coverage and incomplete. Trying to get it to Devontae Parker. Covered well on the play. Got Damar Hamlin back there. It'll be second down and 20. With Micah Hyde out, he went out week two with an injury with his neck, and he's out for the year. I'll tell you, Hamlin has done a nice job with Poyer, who's been in and out himself. He missed four games. Hamlin with a great play there. He's had a heck of a year. Jones hitting John Smith their number two tight end the Patriots they get inside the 20, get into the red zone and they are second worst in the league only Denver is worst inside the 20 only 39% of the time do they get it into the end zone Third and 14. And this time, the pass is with a flank thrown. Jacoby Myers incomplete. You've got Hamlin and Poyer converging on the play. Myers is down. And the pass incomplete. I don't know. Converging. That was just a nasty collision with Hamlin from your left. Boom. Right there. That is a big hit. And Terry, that's a defenseless player right in an ejection. Rolling on the field is an incomplete pass. Personal foul. Unnecessary rest is number three of the defense. Number three of the defense has been disqualified. The penalty half the distance to the goal. It's an automatic first down. Well, there's your answer, Terry. They certainly are going to disqualify. It is clearly shoulder to the head of the defense's receiver and certainly a foul. That was a big collision. We were just talking about how Hamlin has stepped up this year. So he's disqualified yet on that play. And that will end his night. and take a little something under the pocketbook as well. Good to see Myers up. Remember he had that shoulder injury from last week. Cam Lewis comes in to take his spot. First down and goal now. Very high on this rookie receiver and what he can do. He does a really nice job of coming back. Ball thrown behind him a bit. He had a great career in college down at Baylor. Jones gets it away. One-handed. Stevenson. First contact never brings that guy down. He's got soft hands, too. I think as his career grows, people continue to see what he can do. This isn't an easy catch for a big man. The ball's way up in the air. He just puts his right hand up. You can see how soft his hands are. Then he throws the backer down. Milano couldn't take him down. Pump fake by Jones. Guns going deep. And that's incomplete. I thought there should have been a flag, but there was not Dane Jackson covering Thornton on the play. It'll be third down and seven. I think that's a matchup that Mac Jones wanted to try to go after if they ever got a single high safety where you get a one-on-one matchup on the outside. And Dane Jackson is definitely the guy you want to test, but that one didn't have much of a chance at all. I think you talk about McDermott. It's not just the numbers and the winning. It's just you get around this team. It's got a great vibe about it. It seems like a very tight-knit group. Coaching staff, players, really well-run organization. Third and seven. Swing it at Stevenson. He fights his way for a first down. I mean, culture is like an overused phrase these days, but you get the point when the guy comes in and really changes the whole dynamic and the feel around the organization. Yeah, and I don't know, do you feel that he is known around the league and gets the respect that you think he's earned at this point? Should get more. Yeah. Jones. running from here to Providence and it's incomplete. Well, we did a play years ago where McNair ran around for 14 seconds. Jones was in the neighborhood that time. What happened on that play? It's a good question. You remember everything. Freddie Mitchell touchdown. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly right. Just thought you'd pull that one out of your Rolodex. Bang. Pulled it out of Fred Goodelli's Rolodex. Yeah, I heard it. Second and ten. Stevenson again with a convoy. To the 41-yard line. Well, when your offensive line is struggling, it's always a good time to try to get these screens, to try to get some linemen out in front. If you can't run it with Stevenson, throw it to him. Leslie Frazier, the defensive coordinator, sixth year as the D.C. in Buffalo. Catch is made here by Devontae Parker, and he takes down for a first down. If you're a Patriots fan and you're watching, you're asking yourself, why are they not trying to take more shots downfield, especially a guy like Parker? if you see this coverage they are really doing a good job Buffalo's defense with their safeties being back they're just taking away any potential shots downfield Parker's the one guy who could do it averaging 20 yards per grab instead a little bit more underneath as Stevenson gets taken down there by Edmonds and when you watch what they do they've been mixing up two high and one high you get this look and then look at Parker dealing with a couple different guys so it's not as if they're not aware that they need to stretch this defense. It's just tough to do. And again, a short flip, and that's incomplete. And I would just say you can play that kind of defense when you can bully an offensive line, whether it's against a run or a win with a pass rush without having to always blitz. You've got two of the best linebackers playing together in the NFL, and Edmonds and Milano. You've got a great defensive front. It really frees you up to play coverage and not worry about the potential threat of a vertical shot downfield. And you can also play the defense with a 17-point lead late in the game. He plays by moving around and getting matched up with a variety of different corners. That's Stephon Diggs. Just quickness. A lot of underneath routes tonight against Jonathan Jones and the rookie Jack Jones, but hasn't had to have that big. The old state house in Boston with a score 24-7 Buffalo. I always would, but I've got to fly to Dallas after the game tonight. Get it on your device. From the 12-yard line. This drive begins with a 7-yard pickup by Singletary. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Good matchup with Diggs going against Jonathan Jones. Look at how many times he's been lined up. Nine of his 27 routes, just the five targets. Four receptions, 54 yards, and a touchdown early in this game right there where he's able to get the Bills going. He and Josh Allen with that nice play to be able to find their rhythm. Going heavy again to the left this time. Bring the extra lineman in, as they've done with some frequency tonight. Fighting his way for a gain of three. It's Singletary to make a third down and one. I think a lot of people when this season started, Ryan Dable gets his opportunity to become a head coach in New York, doing a great job with the Giants. and everybody wanted to see what Ken Dorsey could do. You know, he's been here. It's his fourth year being a part of this staff. First year, though, as an offensive coordinator and play caller. Everybody had some fun at his expense when he got upset early and he slammed down his laptop. But overall, what a job he's done in his first year. And I think he, again, and Josh Allen get better and better every game. And he's put together a masterpiece tonight against Bill Belichick. Diggs on the slant makes the grab. I think some of the frustration, speaking of offensive coordinators, of course the Patriots had Josh McDaniels for years. Don't have him. Matt Patricia has taken over the plate. Group effort, really. On first and ten, swinging to the outside. And picking up close to ten is Singletary. But it's been so erratic for the New England offense in that against the Jets, nothing offensively, They won the game on Jones' punt return. Looked good and lost to Minnesota. And tonight, not much to write home about. No, no. And, again, I think they knew that this was going to be a tough matchup because of Josh Allen. I don't think anybody expected this with a time of possession where Josh Allen, it hasn't been one of those nights where he's throwing for 300 yards. It's been really more about their ability to have a balanced attack and control the line of scrimmage. By the way, the fact that David Quesenberry is back out there, if a guy deserves a game ball besides the obvious give it to the left tackle who's been limping around the whole night and wincing all night long and that's a nice defensive play there what was his second and one now turns into a third and maybe two and a half that guy we saw right from the get going you mentioned it after the first play had that ankle taped up he couldn't put any more tape around it no, I mean even in that last play he's just trying to hold up I mean look he's getting thrown around He's just taking one for the team tonight, honestly. It's not that he's blowing people off the ball. It's that he's out on the field fighting. Remember, he's a backup left tackle. Deion Dawkins, the starter's out. And he's just showing heart tonight just by being in the lineup with that ankle. And Dawkins has, because of this Thursday game, an extra three days to get ready for their next game against the Jets. as that pass is caught here by James Cook, but he is taken down short of the first down. I think Josh Allen wanted to get that ball out a lot quicker, and for some reason he had the pump fake, and I think that pump fake gave the Patriots defense enough time, led by Devin McCord, to be able to come over and get him out of bounds. So Sam Martin Who had not punted in two games last year Against the Patriots What a workout he's getting tonight Three punts What did you say? He didn't have to shower? He may have to shower tonight Actually he wasn't even a punter last year He definitely didn't shower last year He definitely did not It's a fair court of the 22 Somebody didn't shower You know what? It starts at the top. You've got McDermott comes in. He's done a great job. You've got a franchise quarterback. You've got Brandon Bean, the general manager. The Pagoulas have done a great job running the team. They're looking to get a new stadium, which is in the offing maybe for 2026. So things right now very good in Buffalo land. As the pass is caught up at the 40-yard line by Taequann Thornton. Makes his first catch of the night. From the 8-yard line. Pass to the outside is incomplete. Little high for Hunter Henry. It'll be second down and goal. So 2-1 time of possession. They run 69 plays to 49. and second down and goal now from the eight pressure big sack AJ Epinesa like a jailbreak that time they all came and sack them all the way back for a 16-yard loss. These are the issues for this offense, the edges. Brown doesn't have much of a chance, and Epineza has done such a good job of dropping weight and getting quicker. And again, keep bringing up with Vaughn Miller down, Epineza, Rousseau, Basham, all three of these guys stepping up. Spotted at the 21, so a 13-yard sack. look out again and Jones is able to get away for the moment still trying to get away still trying to get away and then finally flings one to the end zone and incomplete and that takes us all the way to the two-minute warning meanwhile you got Jordan Phillips who's down on the turf they'll work on him with And 1.57 left in the fourth. Triots. Beating the Jets on the punt returns. Looked good the other night against Minnesota. Lost the game. But major issues, you would think, after tonight. What do you think? Yeah, the Minnesota game, you know, they lost the game, but they showed signs of life offensively with the job Mac Jones did in the line. I thought finally, maybe they found something, right? They get Andrews back tonight, and boy, they're back to square one offensively. 39-yard field goal attempt by Falk this time is good to make it 24-10. Seattle. Yeah. Very much in the hunt in the west as well. You know, you talk about Lansing Grump. Meanwhile, you're going to have an onside kick attempt here in a two-possession game. So we were desperate to wind up with an onside kick recovery here. Meanwhile, Buffalo took a look and says we'll take a timeout here. This weekend, meanwhile, what's going to happen over Sunday and Monday? Washington and the Giants. The box game on Sunday at 1 o'clock. You got Miami at San Francisco. Good game. Yep. Late afternoon window on Fox. Kansas City and Cincinnati Sunday on CBS. I'm going to try to take that one in. And then the Dallas Cowboys hosting the Indianapolis Colts on NBC Sunday night. Cowboys with a mark of 8-3 in that NFC East. I'm going to go to that Cincinnati-Kansas City game and report next week. I'll give you a full report. Yeah. Oh? Yeah. How many games are you going to see this weekend? Like nine? Meanwhile, there's the bouncy ball, and it's recovered there by Gabriel Davis. What college game are we doing this week? I'm doing a TCU against Kansas State Big 12 championship down at AT&T. They're trying to secure the spot into the playoffs. If they win, it's a lock. If they lose, they still make it in there. USC is a big one. You're a Los Angeles guy. They got a game Friday night in the Pac-12 championship against Utah. If they win, they are in the playoff. They win the Pac-12 and may win the Heisman with Caleb Williams. All that in the first year at Lincoln Riley. That's pretty good. Went out and brought in, what, 19? 19 transfer portal. They were 4-8 a year ago. Fired their coach, and away we go. Meanwhile, you've got Buffalo now. They're just going to take a knee, lead the clock. New England, they could take their timeouts here, but, you know, if you're Belichick, what are you going to do at this point? Yeah. In all seriousness. Not to mention, you know, they have the class of taking a knee here. They're basically saying this is enough. Right. We've had enough.
