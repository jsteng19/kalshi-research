 Rain earlier, showers about an hour and 45 minutes away on the radar. Kickoff rule has been adjusted. They're expecting more returns this year. Damonte Turpin is an all-pro kick returner. Jake Elliott will kick off for the Eagles. Won the toss, defer the option in the second half. Our honor to start and end the season. Opener here. We've got Super Bowl 60 on NBC. Who's coming with us? The 20-25 NFL season begins with Turpin returning from the five. Trying to find an opening down the sideline at a bounce right around the 32-yard line. That's where the Dallas offense will begin. Doc Prescott, Mississippi State. Javante Williams, North Carolina. C.D. Lamb, Oklahoma. Kevante Turpin, Molo Louisiana. George Beekins, Drip University. Jake Ferguson, Wisconsin. Tyler Guyton, Oklahoma. Tyler Smith, the University of Tulsa. Cooper Bebe, Kansas State. Tyler Booker, Alabama. Terrence Steele, Steele High School. An offensive line, big part of the story for Dallas. Three Tylers, all first round picks. Injury for the Eagles right away. Ben Van Sumeren, linebacker and fullback. And you can see he is really distraught about it right away. Here he is, engaged and blocking. Meantime while you're watching this replay a penalty flag has gone down and Van Sumeren right away on the plant grabbed that leg and went to the ground. So I mentioned the flag as the athletic training staff is looking at Van Sumeren. Sean Smith the referee trying to get between the teams and one of the other officials threw a penalty flag. No surprise. Edgy with the Cowboys and the Eagles. For the moment, the attention and the disappointment for the Eagles and Nick Sirianni around Van Sumer in their fullback in kick coverage. The attention with the fans, though, on the Dallas Cowboys and how that played out afterwards. So it is going to be one of those starts already to this season. We talked about the movement of the kickoff. If it's to promote more kickoff returns, the touchbacks now come out to the 35-yard line. Unsmarty like Kondo. Defense number 98. Number 98 defense action has disqualified from the game. Whoa. 15-yard penalty. Whoa. So Jalen Carter, the focus and the star for the Cowboys, for the Eagles on the front line, out for the game before a snap. Here he goes. He walks there. In front of Dak Prescott. Did he spit? Did he spit on him? I think he did. There you go. There you go. And the official was right there to throw the flag. Brian Neal, the umpire, who was keeping an eye on that confrontation. No idea, obviously, what was said. but Jalen Carter out of this game before a snap. Chris, that's, first of all, I got no idea what he's thinking and second, this is massive in terms of the game. I gotta tell you he's the best player they have on their defense and about 80% of what we were going to talk about on this broadcast because to beat the Philadelphia Eagles you have to double team Jalen Carter. If you don't, you don't get your offense started. Now you take off that one player on the defense that you had to focus your attention on, and it's almost like Micah Parsons now gone from the Cowboys. Same impact now with Jalen Carter gone. Meantime, the injured player, Van Sumeren, is being carted off the field. A whole bunch of the Eagles came out to give their wishes to a guy who was going to play some in a fullback role in this offense this year. So you talk about trying to repeat his champs. And the path is never easy, right? You don't pick up where you left up. And before a snap, a player you are counting on is out for the season, perhaps with a leg injury. And this man is certainly out for the game before even being on the field. You just can't believe what you just saw. From the 47, Dak Prescott hits Javante Williams. He's now the running back for Dallas into Eagles territory at the 46. Dak Prescott missed half of last year after the hamstring surgery. Had an injury in Atlanta. It forced him to have to step away. He's had multiple injuries over the last few years. Chris went healthy. He is still a very, very good quarterback. I mean, two years ago, he's an inside linebacker, and he's the best in football in his first year. Now he was working behind Jalen Carter, which certainly helped, but just a remarkable story. interpretive motion second and 23 press got taken a shot towards Pickens on the sideline trying to come up with a one-hand grab could not working on Quinn young Mitchell who had his left arm pin the flag is thrown by the back judge Pass interference. Defense number 27. The ball will be placed up spot on the foul. Automatic goes down. And that's what Pickens does best. Contested catches. And just got Dallas out of a huge hole with that. And you can see that Mitchell has his hand inside the front of the jersey right there. And Pickens just couldn't get off. Tried to make the catch with one. and Sirianni wants no part of it. But that was a huge play because of the way the Cowboys were backed up. 34-yard penalty. From the 12th, Prescott play action. Roy's back in the end zone towards Jalen Colbert. That's Mitchell all across the defense to make the play. Mignon Mitchell, what a rookie year he had last year. Yeah, Dak is going for the jugular on that one. But I should have just taken the quick one right here Sometimes when you get it going and you hit some of those big plays down the field This is a first down throw just take one take a little game Completely covered on the back line in the end zone First incompletion of the night for Prescott Down right inside Good run Williams powering forward to the two Inside the two its first and goal for the Cowboys here at the back end of this first quarter How we're running here Cowboys get on the ball don't have to run a play Looks like they're just playing out. And this first quarter will come to an end. Two full drives, two touchdowns, and ejects into the Eagles' best defensive player. We're all tied at 7. After the opening quarter of the season, it's time now for our Accenture in-game update. And Prescott gives to Williams inside for the touchdown. Two drives to Javante Williams. One-yard touchdown runs. And Dallas leads 13-7. You know, Mike, I think we have to talk about something here. And the Dallas Cowboys certainly running the football and doing well. But remember how many players now the Philadelphia Eagles are missing on this defense. Josh Sweat, who led them in sacks. Milton Williams, who signed a $104 million contract with New England. N'Kobe Dean still out. They get Jahan Campbell. Darius Slay, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, Brandon Graham. That's a lot of people on the defense, and it's showing up right now without Jalen Carter. Yeah, take Carter out of there to start tonight, too. That's a lot of guys who played a lot of great snaps with him. Aubrey the extra point. 14-7. Cowboys on top. A terrific job he has done with personnel and Nick Sirianni, another hire for this team that has worked out. The kickoff does not work out for Aubrey. Second touchback. It's time Philly will get it at 35-yard line. The rule adjustment from last year when he came out to the 30. Yeah, I get the feeling that Aubrey's just missed those two kicks, don't you? It looked like he was trying to bounce them into the field of play in the corner, He just was too much adrenaline on both of them and a lot of the kickers around the league talked about kicking Dirty kick dirty ball the special teams guys are talking about what you can get rolling on the field inside the landing area and slow down The return man Drive to four Hertz It was a template touchdown drive Barkley Bounce and a move across the 40 to the 41-yard line. It's Otegi Sua over there for Dallas. I'll tell you, how many games last year did we do, Mike, with Saquon Barkley? I mean, it felt like he was running for 70 yards. Every other play, it was remarkable the performance that he had in L.A., first of all. And then the one back here in the playoff game in the snow and just dominated. Really probably would have held the NFL record had he been able to play in that last game. And there's Trayvon Diggs in the game now for the Dallas Cowboys. Last couple of years, knee issues, no action in the preseason. But in the lineup here, only one snap of that opening drive out on the field now. Underneath Devontae Smith has it. Run down by Kenneth Murray, the linebacker out in coverage, but it's a Philadelphia first down. And let's talk a little bit about this secondary for the Dallas Cowboys. Diggs coming off the knee injuries. And of course he was just remarkable back in 21 when he had those 11 interceptions Ron bland had the stress fracture in his foot last year They got tire eel of a former first-round pick out of Florida, but he basically was a fail in Buffalo And now he's the starting corner out here against the Eagles on opening night A.J. Brown right now 46 to the way midfield. A run of about five yards. Magic those feet, those quick moves. Well, Ozo Diggie Zoua did his job there. He was five yards into the backfield to be able to make that play and just wall it off. And the fact that Saquon somehow escaped that mess and really the blame is going to go on Dante Fowler for that. He had to clean that up and keep that containment on the outside. The Cowboy 49 hurts. And he's got it. Takes it for about three yards. Third and a couple coming up. Goddard 42 catches. We're low in games last year. He played 10. But when healthy, he's still a player who will be a part of this Philly offense this season. the Eagles on offense are like a good boxer. It's like they just jab, jab, jab, hit you in the belly a couple times, jab, jab, and then all of a sudden you start creeping in and trying to make plays and stop Saquon, and then one of these two wide receivers, Devontae Smith, A.J. Brown, they get the one-on-one they want, and it usually does not go well for the opponent. Third and three, Hurts comes back to the middle. Big hit in the middle, but held onto by Goddard for the first down. Took a look to the outside, but connects with Goddard. Back-to-back trips. First down to 39. New play caller for the Eagles. Kevin Petullo's been with Nick Sirianni for a while, Chris. Now he's the man with the voice in Jalen Hurts' headset. And Kellen Moore was here last year and, of course, did such a great job. But it really was those three that really created the offense for the Philadelphia Eagles in that championship run. And now it's those two. And for the first time, at least with the Eagles, Petulo is the one calling the plays. Moore off to be the head coach with the Saints. From the 39, Hurts out of the pocket. A couple yards, and it's an India moment to go. Kylan Granson's a new tight end in Philly. He was with the Colts before. And signed as a free agent with Philly here this year. Does it look like Jalen Hurts is even more calm than he was in the past couple of years? Which is hard to do always calm yes always but I mean here's a guy that really seeks out advice from Championship type people you know Peyton Manning certainly top the list for him for a long time Derek Jeter Tom Brady guys that have won championships and now he's only interested in winning again And he made that very clear and Michael Jordan to that was yeah as well brand guys and nine. Hurts, nothing open, buy some time, and has a lot of space. And the first down inside the 30. Cowboys sideline irate. They wanted a holding penalty as Hurts escaped, but he's got a first down after 29. He's killing them, and he kills a lot of teams with this because he's willing to stay in the pocket. The Cowboys finally answered with some man coverage. The problem with man coverage, you got your back turned to the quarterback and the minute you turn your back on this quarterback it's gonna be first and ten for the Eagles. 41 the Cowboys rookie edge rusher Donovan Isaraku out of BC Boston College. He was the one the coaching staff thought was being held. First and ten, Barclay, powerful one, four. The 35 yard line for Marshawn Neeland. Part of that edge rotation the guys who are trying to fill the Micah Parsons void. Number 39, direction number 39. Five-yard penalty. First down. So the Eagles take over at the 30, and here's their offense. Jay LaHurst, Rose Sorenes. Saquon Barkley, Penn State. A.J. Brown, Ole Miss. Devontae Smith, Emmitt Louis-Anne. Jahan Dodson, 6-4-0. Dallas Goddard, South Dakota State. Jordan Mailata, Jeff Southland University. Landon Dickerson, Alabama. Cam Juergens, Nebraska. Tyler Steen, Alabama. Blaine Johnson, Oklahoma. So Steen in there is the only new face in that starting lineup replacing Makai Becton He's now with the Chargers via free agency Jalen Hurts in the champs start from the third Sideline pick up up about nine off the throw from the Super Bowl MVP want to talk about a winner check out this number Jalen Hurts has played for the championship five of the last nine years in football three times in college to the last three Super Bowls And he's had two great Super Bowl saves really for one play Chris. He really did. And the fact that he overcame what happened to him in one of those national championships when Tua came in and threw the game when he touched down to do what he's done for New York. Barkley's first run will be a first down across the 40 to the 41-yard line for Saquon Barkley. Ninth player in the history of the National Football League with 2,000 yards last year. And right in the middle of your screen there Kenny Clark and he's gonna have to be the one that starts to solidify this Run defense up front the Cowboys are just sick and tired of having people run the football and their inability to run the ball And yet so far in this game at least on offense. They have been able to run it Just passed the 40 Mark of this guy in the 48-yard line. He's second and three for a man who's very effective on the move. And I don't think that we recognize the ability of quarterbacks to make plays like this enough. I mean, if he completes a pass, a beautiful throw, it's great. But second down and short in the National Football League is your dream down. Because the way that these guys play, when they get to third and two, let's say, they could run two quarterback sneaks and pick up the first down. They basically have a free down right here to do whatever they want to do 59 is Kenneth Murray. He's calling the defensive signals new to the Cowboys 36-yard line the first down for Barkley You get all these guys here you're gonna pull this guard everybody's going to think this and they go flip 90 out this way that's what I'm saying this was a free play this was a chance to just take a shot at something that might pop and it did we'll get into it as the night goes on this Eagle team Barkley the 2,000 yards hurts the Super Bowl success it starts up front and they are as good a unit as there is in the league Will Shipley is now the back Hurts over the middle for gutter. Tagged at the 30. Jack Sandhorn punching at the ball. New Cowboy linebacker joins Malik Hooker on the tackle. And, Mike, for the Dallas Cowboys, they're playing Jalen Hurts and this tremendous offense and great offensive line. But your offense just did it, right? The Cowboys offense took it right down the field and scored a touchdown. You've got to answer that effort on defense. You've got to come back and make a stop, hold them to at least a field goal here. 30-yard line, Shipley, quick hitter to the right side. And a first down for Will Shipley, the second year back out of Clemson, with the back end of a blowout NFC Championship game win over Washington. Had a couple of really nice runs, including a touchdown. I don't know what you do when the Philadelphia Eagles get off the bus. Everybody except Devontae Smith. I mean, it just looks like big-time wrestling or something coming off the bus. They are just big and tough. Out quick to Shipley. Receivers blocking. Shipley inside the 10. First and goal. Philadelphia at the 6. So the second-year man, Will Shipley, a little more part of the offense. And we are seeing blocking out of everybody on the outside. The Philadelphia Eagles have really come together as a team. And watch Devontae Smith, all 170 pounds of him on the outside, doing a job for his teammates. He's the only guy that when you look at him, you go, there's only one guy done blowing in the field right now. Because they're all so big. Jahan Dotson, the receiver they got last year in August in a trade with Washington. 51-yard catch, the longest since his rookie season. Yeah, and Dotson was the first-round pick himself, 16th overall pick, and he is an excellent player. Howie Roseman made a trade for John Mechie from Houston, so depth in that receiving core as well. Philly gets the ball to start the second half. Chance to double up here. 26, Hurts to Barkley again. Open field, forget about it. Saquon powers through to the 18. pick up for me always wondered what it'd feel like to be drawn bland in that situation and looking at Saquon Barkley coming at you such a rare combination of a guy that can beat you with his moves and if all of a sudden you're playing his moves he can run right through you you want to try okay that's just the way you said I thought you were That 30 to how they go empty and your first thought is they're gonna run hurts Barkley brings it down inbounds and then gets out of bounds to stop the clock at the 15-yard line chains move Eagles keep all three timeouts with 64 seconds to go A heck of a job by Barkley right there on a big down if they had missed that throw They would have had to have settled for the field goal in all likelihood Not only did he make the catch, but he got his feet down and Eberfuss trying to find an answer Let go as the Bears head coach last year He's calling the defensive signals for Dallas Opposite Nick Sirianni those two were coordinators at the same time in Indianapolis the staffs who know each other well from the 15-5 in the pattern for Hertz looking to escape the sideline there if Jamon Clark was the one chasing and I don't think Jamon Clark did this he just had momentum going and then took out somebody on the sideline and that's really what caused the bigger issue with Jalen Hurts in this town it's a good time to have your back right second and five again still all three timeouts so plenty of run options available for Sirianni and Kevin Petullo the offensive coordinator Words exchange big scrum of folks after the score Officials get everybody separated After Barkley's first touchdown of the year one of the big questions was without Makai back to playing guard When we get that same level of play that was beautifully done that time by his replacement Tyler's theme and The Cowboys knew it they knew if Saquon Barkley started running past the line of scrimmage They were gonna have a really tough time trying to tackle him and it's like everybody else Philadelphia, three drives, 30 plays, 216 yards, three touchdowns. Two for Jalen Hurts, one for the Offensive Player of the Year, Saquon Barkley. Eagles on top for the first time in 25. On YouTube, the scene down in Sao Paulo. Look forward to watching that tomorrow night. Elliott's kick bounces in the landing area. Turpin can't get it cleanly. Scoops it. Tries to escape like he did against Washington last year. Doesn't. Well, their defense cannot stop the Eagles from running the football. And credit to Jake Elliott. A hard-to-catch kickoff forces the Cowboys to start. The back of their own 12. Prescott goes sideline for a land flag in. Jantorian Bennett who's in there at the corner spot former Las Vegas Raiders defense number 23 finished second in the MVP balloting so let's remember what he was before he got hurt a season ago U10 in the league for Dak they put it in the hands of Turpin the return man with great speed featured on the second down for the first first down of the Dallas season I think this is going to be one of the surprises for this season is how much Kevontae Turpin is being used. Of course, we saw what he did as a return man. And remember, Tyreek Hill, with his early days with the Kansas City Chiefs, he didn't play a whole lot of receiver either. Got a chance, so who knows? They're going to try to work Turpin in a lot more into this offense. At the Philadelphia 42-yard line. Prescott out quick. It's caught. Welcome to the Cowboys. George Pickens gets tagged there. Bill Markman, the 37-yard line. First three years in Pittsburgh. High productivity, some star plays. Also caused a lot of attention with his antics. Question is, how focused will Pickens be? So far, Chris, the reports have been good. Yeah, and I think he spent a lot of time with C.D. Lamb, and C.D. Lamb was, you know, full of praise with Pickens. But what Pickens does is he is one of the very best in the NFL deep ball catchers. So if you're going to leave him one-on-one on the outside, they're simply going to throw it up to him. From the 36, Williams running up the middle, close to a first down. Shy of the 32-yard line. Javante Williams behind a good offensive line. Could be a good equation for Dallas this year. Well, this is a dream come true for the Dallas Cowboys. You've got Jalen Carter out of the game now. Their entire game plan, they were thinking about going no huddle, so they had to substitute him out. so they could throw the football. And so far now, what we've seen in the early going is Jalen Carter out of the game, no double teams, and the Cowboys are doing exactly what they hope to do in this one, which is start out running the football. A lot on Jordan Davis, number 90, with Carter ejected before the first snap of the game. Prescott, play action, about to get hit, throwing it. It's open for C.B. Latton inside the five. First and goal, Dallas, as Prescott gets Lamb down to the two. Dallas runs to the ball. What a move on the outside by C.D. Lamb. Almost nobody can stay with him and not Adoree Jackson. Remember, Darius Slade gone for the Eagles, and they're right after his replacement, Adoree Jackson. First and goal, Dak putting it up for Lamb. Contact and a flag on Jackson. veteran in his ninth year, last four years with the Giants. Darius Slay was released, signed with the Steelers. Jackson takes over at corner. Defense number eight. Half the difference. Automatic for the style. Absolutely no question. So taking advantage of both of the weaker parts now for the Philadelphia Eagles. along the defensive line with no Carter and going right after a Dory Jackson in the secondary. What a drive this has been so far for Dallas. Javante Williams, the running back, first and goal, Cowboys. And Jack Kingston left side into the end zone for the season first touchdown This is where you're going to have to win the battle, right? And here, and for the Philadelphia Eagles on that drive, there was nothing fancy. Tyler Smith, who is the best offensive lineman for the Dallas Cowboys, simply had no problem at all with Jordan Davis. and Tyler Guyton was able to finish it off with Zach Bond. Usually you're seeing the Jalen Carter-Zach Bond combination, but that goes out the window now. Two years in the league, both years on the all-throw team. Brandon Aubrey has the first extra point of the year. You want to talk about a stunning start to the season. Best player on the Philly defense spits on the Cowboy quarterback. He's ejected, and the Cowboys take off the other way. Javante Williams, the touchdown. 7-0 Dallas. Wow. First spitting on Dak Prescott. Toss from the game. The Eagles go down the field. Six plays, 53 yards. Now Aubrey to kickoff. It goes into the end zone. Landing in the end zone. That's a touchback. We have a penalty marker down at the 45-yard line. A touchback will bring the ball to the 35-yard line instead of the 30-yard line this year. But let's check the flag. Sean Smith is the referee. Illegal motion on the receiving team number nine, moving prior to the kick. Keeps it that way. There's Turpin down the sideline. The punch towards the door in Jackson's chest to create space into Philly territory for a first down. Great job by Dak. He saw the slot blitz, so he knew that was going to be man coverage against one of the toughest guys to cover. One-on-one, Kevante Turpin. Get him the football and take a chance. Often that turns into something really big. Nice job playing quarterback there for Dak Prescott. Keep going at Adoree Jackson. New corner here for Philly. Whistle here from the sideline in Dallas. First start. Take a timeout. Cowboy ball at midfield. First and ten. 5.26 left in his first half. 14 on perfect you love the office you will love the paper hinge it on peacock do it tonight after the game six one defense here Mike I'm first down press got they run into it but he can't get there at the back end of it the league has been talking about sportsmanship and unsportsmanlike conduct in terms of taunting after plays try to clean it up this year taunting defense number three Chris we've talked to the officials and to everyone in New York this is something that every team has been told they're gonna be watching for this year the old point of emphasis and I don't think that Sanders ever even saw it He sort of just stood up and walked over that way and flexed a tiny bit, and that was enough. It is going to be enforced in a way that we haven't seen in the past this season. From the 35 on first down, Prescott deep drop, covered, gets away for the moment, gets away again. Jack was looking to throw he's gonna run and he gets three yards out of his the slide began at the 32 Jordan Davis almost had a sack I mean this is terrific by Dak Prescott this is going to end up in one of those second down and 20 kind of situations and he scrambles out and yes he only gets three or four yards but it really meant about 10 12 yards to his offense and so far Dak and that tied up hamstring that was talking about whatever they did they fixed him you could not have done that season ago and it was before the injury as well as it was still healing inside the handoff goes it is turpin for the 27 yard line so a lot of turpin here being used by Dallas in this opening half and they're doing a lot with formations and motions here, Mike, because that time CeeDee Lamb was in motion really for the first time over to Pickens' side, and then what are they going to do? They're going to draw eyeballs there and run back that way. So they're trying to get you to adjust to their two-star players and run away. 3rd and 2, Dak Rennett decides to give it. First down for Williams. Devontae has got two touchdowns tonight, takes it to the 23-yard line. The Cowboys continue to move it effectively. They're getting good blocks inside, too. Cooper BB Tyler Booker all those young guys playing in there now they go to the hurry up Although really you would like to burn a little clock here. They have been able to stop Philadelphia I don't know how fast Lock them in substitute Got it. And yet here we go. Still milking that clock. I got you. Here we go. With dash and the throw inside the line. Caught at the incomplete. Incomplete. From the far side of the offensive side. Hit the ground first. And it will be second down. So Brian Schottenheimer is the offensive toward air last year. Mike McCarthy was the head coach. As you get a look at that ball clearly hitting the ground. Is the offense the first one you've seen in this first half? It is. And A, they've been separating their two-star receivers but we've seen a lot of tight formations and we've seen a lot of quick motions to try and force the defenses to make adjustments remember this is a very young Eagles defense now they substituted in a lot of guys that they lost in free agency and it's showing almost a gift to Fletcherner's assessment from Byron Young as he was reacting for 50 Philly will take a timeout here before his attempt from 53 yards. So, in the past, they've had these K-balls, the footballs that were just for kickers, and the kickers would only get to work those balls in, out of the box, for about 45 minutes before the game. Now, each team, like you do with the balls that you use on offense, can work in these kicking balls during the year. So there's a feeling amongst kickers and special teams folks around the league, we may see longer field goals made. It's not a problem with this guy. No. He can kick anything about 60 yards. But it's something to keep in mind this year with that. Of course. He's just so smooth with that swing of the leg. Seven possessions in the half. Seven scores. Dallas two field goals, and Chris backed up. They're very well done to get three points out of that. One stop on one third down, the only non-touchdown. Melissa. Brian, four drives, four scores. What's working for you guys? We're getting completion. We're running the ball well. Our guys are playing hard. It's a hell of a football game right now, and we feel good right now. And defensively, how do you contain the Eagles rushing attack, especially Jalen Hurts? Yeah, we've got to tackle better, number one, and our rush lane discipline's not good enough. We've got to get that cleaned up. Ryan, thanks. Thank you. Phillies run for 123 yards in that first half. They get the ball to start the second half. Eagles by one. Toyota halftime. There's still a front to clear here. We may see a little more wind. May get lucky in the rain. Could just miss us to the west. We'll keep an eye on it. Kickoff to be returned by John Mechie down the sideline. He's shy in the 30th and 28. Here's Melissa a moment ago with Nick Sirianni. Nick, three personal fouls, an ejection on defense. What was your message to your guys? Yeah, we can't have any of those. Obviously, we've given them short fields here. This is a good offense, and we can't help them out at all, so we can't have those. Three touchdowns, no punts on offense. How do you continue that in the second half? Yeah, we just got to continue doing the fundamental things, blocking, taking care of the football, making good catches. Jalen's going to do a good job, but we have to be ready for them to adjust, and we will as well. Thanks, Nick. Thank you. all about fundamentals and Nick Sirianni has proven that with a terrific record his first four seasons. First down hurts the pass inside. First hit by Jack Sanborn and others on Dallas Goddard. Now to the 32-yard line. Picked up a four. Yeah, and they've got new linebackers here for the Dallas Cowboys as well, right? Kenneth Murray comes over. They made a deal with the Titans to get him. Jack Sanborn came over with Matt Eberflues. He had him in Chicago so a lot of moving parts this defense is going to get better but obviously no Micah Parsons and it's been very apparent yeah no impact yeah no sacks Hertz has been able to buy time this regain of five second and five hurts first down. As Goddard's caught his sixth ball of the night. Mike, watch. Jalen Hurts in the pocket here. Now eventually going to get some pressure right here. Watch him just stand there. He is just so confident in what he's doing and maybe more so what his offensive line is doing for him. And he's not looking to run. He's only doing it when he has to. 39 out quick. DeMonte Smith's got it. Short gain of a couple. That is Kyrie Elam, Bill's first-round pick, trying to hope that the change of scenery in Dallas will change the trajectory of his career. But there's what you talked about with Hurts, his ability to have time to read it and throw it. Well, and he's done a good job getting the ball out here quickly, too, obviously scrambling. But he's such a complete quarterback. And I hit on it a little bit in the first half. But to me, quarterbacks convert third downs, that's what matters, and convert the red zone. And he has just been sensational, especially when they got into that playoff run a season ago. The 42, Barkley to the left. It's strung out. Barkley's going to first down. Attack with him like that. Saquon past midfield into Dallas territory at the 47-yard line. Gain of 11. Sometimes you end up hitting Saquon Barkley at the end of a run, and you just assume he's on the ground and he's not. I don't know exactly who it was, came up, made this hit. Boom, right there. And it was Hooker. And you just think that he's going to be on the ground because I hit him that hard. And he's not. Barkley gets a break. A.J. Dillon, the former Packer, is in the backfield. Will Shipley was not in on that last kickoff return. So it's the first carries an eagle for Dillon who takes it inside the 40. And is right at the mark. Close to a first down at the 36-yard line. Missed all of 2024. The neck injury started his career with four good years in Green Bay. Yeah, and you get Saquon out of the lineup and you go, oh, shoot, that's good. Get that big guy out of there. And then in comes another 250-pound running back that has thighs even bigger than Saquon Barkley. I mean, it's nuts. When they stand side by side and practice the other day, they look like two guards standing next to each other. Second and short. We have been push-pushless thus far here tonight. I expect Dylan inside. He's going to be close to a first down. We'll see where they mark him. They're going to move the chains past the 36-yard line. For a Philly first down, and an eagle slow to get up is an important guy for them in Landon Dickerson. Dickerson was a question mark with a right knee injury in camp. Took part in practice most of the week, but the day he missed was because of a back injury. Yeah, he had meniscus surgery on August 10th. So, like, two weeks later, he was back in the huddle and practicing. But you can tell he is in pain right now. The 36 inside again with Dillon. That time they stop him is the safety. Donovan Wilson crashes down. Chris, we haven't had a chance to mention on the Dallas front, as Barkley comes back in, Mozzie Smith, their first-round pick from 2023, inactive, a healthy scratch here tonight for Dallas. Yeah, and if you're inactive with what they've got at defensive tackle, that's as close to being cut as you can be, right? I mean, they've got Solomon Thomas and a rookie and Jay Toya, but it's quite the statement about your former number one pick. I'll take it to 10 Hertz to the air. Pressure on here, and there's the first sack of the season. And Kenny Clark is involved in it along with Marshawn Nealon. So Clark, who came over in the drain from Micah Parsons, joins Nealon on the sack of Hertz back at the 44-yard line. Marshawn Nealon's going to be the one that gets there first, and then you're going to see Clark come in and clean it up. And this Nealon has just been pushing and fighting, and every time I studied him for quite some time during the offseason, because we had a lot of time, and got a chance to watch him. And what just impressed you about him was just the pure effort. But for Kenny Clark to already be on the marker, they desperately needed that. Now they cannot give this one up on third and whatever it is. Third, 18, pressure from the edge. Hertz gets rid of it in time. Caught the 40-yard line by Dotson. It was taken back at Hurts who took a shot on the edge pressure. From here, a field goal would be 58 yards. It has a little bit of wind with it, and they're going to try it with Jake Elliott. Yeah, and it's very rare that you see Jordan Mailata get beat, and that's a good sign for the Cowboys. Dante Fowler, who had 10 sacks a season ago for Washington, and this is a big kick right here. You don't really think of Jake Elliott as a long-range kicker. He used to be. Last year was terrible from 50-plus. He made one in warm-ups from 62 in this direction. This is 58. It's plenty long enough and good. Wow. Eagles special teams coordinator Michael Clay told me this week that Jake Elliott's got his swagger back. Looks like the Jake Elliott we've come to know. He does on that one. Good from 58. and the Philly lead is now four they're all like five six table range you can see him from five or six tables away let's kick off to be returned Jalen's hold with for the ten got away from one tackle tries to come to the wide start but it's chased down the 29 yard line by John Mechie special teams play all right let's take a look at our 4k sky camp brought to you by Walmart plus good chance to look inside at some of these offensive linemen. Tyler Booker was the 12th overall pick out of Alabama. Both these teams have new right guards playing for them this season, and so far Booker's been hanging in there. You know, he's kind of a mauler. He's still learning, especially with some of the pass protection, but he's done a good job with the running game for the most part tonight. The ball, he placed that spot on the foul, automatic goes down. They're definitely looking for corners the Philadelphia Eagles are trying to replace Darius lay contact with lamb Bennett was guilty takes the ball to the 21 38 seconds down around the quarterback let's see if this is going to push him out I think they might have gotten the personal file from the pastor defense from the group second 15-yard penalty on Nolan Smith the unsportsmanlike conduct the taunting on the last drive. Terry McCauley, our rules analyst, three-time Super Bowl referee. Does that fit into the category of forcible contact? I think so, Mike. He pushes his head back. It's a pretty good blow to the head. Correct call for roughing the passer. Thanks, Terry. So great to have you with us again this year. Remember, Brandon Aubrey has the longest leg in the league we've seen over the last couple of years. The Dallas game field goal range another first down or so. Go to timeouts and 34 seconds. Man rush, Prescott throws sideline. It's caught by Ferguson. Timeout Dallas. That's a 45-yard line. 27 seconds to go. Back in 30 seconds after this from AWS. See how AWS AI levels up the game. The rookie linebacker he is super talented but when you get in these kinds of situations you like to go after some youth And brings up third down 20 seconds left Think of Aubrey and his leg usually 60 yarders are in play that would mean getting to the 42 yard line just A dozen yards away. There is a little bit of breeze into The direction Aubrey would be kicking right now In the heavy wind, but it is going that direction left to right as you watch Take his own defense with CD work in the middle. And on third and five, out quick, Prescott, a little bit behind, Pickens, did he bring it in? Yes, at the 45, he's got it. Clock's still running, they want to save it for the field goal, got to get it snapped quickly here. Eight seconds now, it's finally stopped. Schottenheimer said he was trying to get a timeout, he's talking to the official on his side now. We'll get a conversation if time will be put back on the clock. Third final charge timeout, Dallas. 30 seconds. Game clock operator, please reset the game clock for 15 seconds. 1-5 on the game clock, please. Okay, so he's trying to get the timeout. The official is trying to get the ball spotted. He's got the time, but now, Chris, you're out of timeouts. So you've got to put some thought into this. You've got to put some thought into it, and so the Eagles have put some thought into it as well. So they're going to protect the boundaries and not give you anything cheap to make this field goal a little easier. Now, if you want to take a chance, there's no reason you couldn't take one and throw it up down the field to one of these great contested catch wide receivers. Philadelphia is taking a timeout here. Melissa, what's been going on down that Cowboy sideline? Yeah, I've been watching Dak after that first touchdown. He high-fived the entire offense and said to the guys, let's sustain this. After the second touchdown, so fired up, went down the bench, slapping all the guys on their shoulders and said, come right back. And then before this drive, hey, be ready to score some more points. He has been so animated and so energetic on this timeline. He's 32, 10th year in the league. He's only seen the statesman on his team now. He really is. And you're going to see these corners staying out wide. They're not giving a quick out here. The timeout for Dallas. Prescott throwing inside. It's caught by Ceebill. Down to 35. Got to try to down the ball here. They try to get it to the referee. He's got to touch it. He does. Can we get the snap off they do with three seconds left and they'll get a chance to try a field goal of inside 55 yards be about Beautifully handled that time by the Dallas Cowboys and obviously we've seen that before where it didn't work out quite so well for them But they had that well orchestrated well coach Job by shot and hi burn his team Aubrey in his career 24 of 27 from tonight and really all the Cowboys on offense and all the Eagles on offense and doing a good job all night long. I'll say every drive is lit to point here tonight. Good first down blocking. Clear space for Jelonte Williams out to the 35-yard line. Williams now 10 carries, 44 yards. It is Dallas debut. Yeah, one of the things the Cowboys have flashed a little bit tonight is some of this motion. Watch the tight end come back and then trap back here. So he's going across the face of the quarterback and then coming back and just running that inside zone back away from it. So just a little different look, and it's paid off for this Cowboys running game. Four, Williams. A couple of yards there. Injury updates to the million. Dory Jackson, their corner, was evaluated for a concussion. Wasn't on the field at the end of that first half. Cleared was out there for the opening play of this drive is not back on the sideline still with his helmet And they're definitely trying to figure things out at that other quarterback position Julie Ringo was in the Battle Jaquari and Bennett was in there and Know that they've ever really firmly settled on who the long-term answer is going to be Jaylin Carter ejected before the first snap of the game Third and one Dallas will pitch it to the edge with Williams. Gets there. A couple tough yards. Zach Vaughn, among others, crashing down on him. Jalix Hunt off the end. The first down for the Cowboys. We're playing some NFC East football right now. That was awesome. You knew the big collision was coming at the end of that one, and Javante Williams just lowered his head and plowed through it for the first down. That was terrific. Dallas is on 33 plays here tonight. 16 rushes, Chris. 17 pass attempts. Prescott, quick look down the seam. It is broken up. He's got to squeeze it in. The brevins fan, Ford, the tight end. Good job by the rookie backer, Jihad Campbell. Going back with him, injury though. For the Eagles and Sidney Brown, one of the safeties as they try to replace C.J. Gardner-Johnson's spot. The veteran traded to Houston. Athletic training staff out to look at Sidney Brown. The rookie out of Texas, back in a safety spot. Second and ten, Prescott gives it. Miles Sanders running. It opens face. There goes Sanders at the 30. Chases a 20. Bond brings him down at the 10. But Miles Sanders, his first four years at Eagle, comes back to hit a big one for 50 yards against his old team. Just beautifully done. Lead out in front of here. And you just have to be patient here. Miles Sanders just waits and waits. Got some big block down the field that really sprung him. And then watch Bond at the end of it. He probably gave up 15 yards, but he had a plan. He was going to run him down and punch this ball out. Just missed it as Sanders pulled it away at the last second. Officially 49 yards. First and 10 at the 11. Sanders remains the back. He's got it again inside this time. Here comes the flag. There comes more conversation at the back end. Pickens involved. Couldn't catch the number of the Eagle. Engaged with George Pickens. A new addition to the Dallas lineup. Targeted three times. Two catches tonight. Here's Sean Smith. Personal foul. Offense number three. Unnecessary roughness. 15-yard penalty. He played first down. It's a great job by Blankenship not reacting. If he had reacted and knocked him down, they wouldn't have gotten the benefit of it. So tremendous discipline there on the part of the Eagles, not so much on the part of Pickens. A ton of large penalties in this game right from the start. Ten total, seven on the Eagles. That's the third on the Cowboys. and now backs them up to first and 22. Going to have to work inside here with this shell coverage. Prescott tries to middle for the tight end again. Incomplete. Taking him all the way back with Zach Vaughn, the all-pro linebacker. Would not let Jake Ferguson see the ball. Nealon made the stop. I'm not sure how Saquon Barkley held on to that ball. You saw a great hustle out of Marshawn Nealon. and you'll see it every time he plays football. Watch the tail end of the play. 94 is going to come right back here and get his hand right on the ball. That is a fumble almost 90% of the time, and somehow the strength of Saquon Barkley held on. He's got plenty of strength. He's just nuts to watch his workout stuff. Inside run, Will Shipley gives Barkley a break and runs for a yard. anything else it's a thing first place your eyes go to that bar oh my god man when all those strong guys watch the show themselves to wow third and five for Philadelphia Dallas twisting four men hurts has all kinds of time escapes runs first down to the night Pass rush not getting there. Hurts getting there. First and goal, Philadelphia. I mean, the Cowboys played just perfectly. All they wanted to do was squeeze Jalen like that. And they did. They had him covered. They got him all contained in there. Watch this. Little loop, little cross. They got it, and somehow he's still weaving through there. I remember Aaron Rodgers was like that when he tried to rush four against him. He could just always find a way through the crease, and there are two creases in there. A goal coming on. Buckley. One inside for a yard with two. Each team has nine first downs. Everybody's scored on the first three drives. Two for Dallas. Philadelphia's trying to make it two for them halfway through the second quarter. Yeah and converting third downs That was a third and five when he made that run right there when Jalen made the run and That out of tush range That when the Cowboys have to win That your chance to get off the field and Three of three on third downs thus far tonight tonight. Second and goal. Hurts again the tie. Now Chase, now taken off to the pylon. Got there! Jalen Hurts for the second time tonight. All right, no Micah Parsons, and you're starting to feel the pain right now. You really are. Donovan Ezraku, a non-factor, got knocked to his knees, left this entire side wide open, and Jalen Hurts is killing him. I mean, he has simply been a one-man show out here tonight. Been doing it with his arm, doing it with his legs, and there's a ring on his finger for that very reason. Jake Elliott. All even at 14. Six for six, throw it. Five rushes for 43 yards. Two touchdowns. Jalen Hurts has two. Javonze Williams has two. And we're tied at 14. Fence in the NFL. Of course, they miss the leadership of a guy like Graham. 206 games in 15 seasons. But they have some young guys trying to figure out. Turpin, the return. brought down 32 by one of those young guys, Sidney Brown. And then on top of all the guys not coming into the season, Chris, there's this with Jalen Carter spitting on Jack Prescott while an Eagles player was injured and Carter was ejected. Jalen Carter is one of my favorite players. I think you know that. That was one of the most ridiculous things. You just might as well have spit in the face of your entire football team, head coach, and everybody involved in the organization. If they lose this game tonight, it will be because Jalen Carter did that before he even played one snap in this game. 31, Prescott, out, caught. Ferguson for a couple to the 33-yard line. Jackson, a blanket chip, are there. They really need Jake Ferguson, the Cowboys do, to get back to the form that he had two years ago. He was a pro bowler, had a great year, had a few injuries he had to deal with, as did Dak Prescott, but if they can get Jake Ferguson and Kevonte Turpin working with Pickens and, of course, CeeDee Lamb on the outside, they've got something. Prescott just one in completion on the 12. Williams goes left for three, has promised Melissa on Dak. Yes, Dak Prescott missed the final nine games of last season And after suffering a right hamstring injury in week 9, he tore two of the three hamstring muscles off the bone. An injury that required surgery in November of last year, where he had three screws inserted to stabilize the hamstring. Dak told us his rehab was tough. Now he feels totally comfortable and confident, saying his mobility won't be affected. He's just as fast as he was before the injury. And we went down to Dallas, as you alluded to earlier, Melissa, on Monday. And Dak walked in the meeting and looked great. Looked great in practice as well. Play pass here. Trying to find some space. Protected the ball and threw it complete to CeeDee Lamb. Jack Vaughn thought he had a pick. Was going after it. But Dak kept it alive and Lamb has a first down. This is what Dak simply could not or did not do successfully a season ago. Scramble to the right all the way back left. Get out turn his body and watch CD come back Inside the cornerback to make that catch. He had to take his hand off the ball Prescott did and still able to complete it. What a start for this Cowboys offense Jordan Davis out of the lineup with a moment for the Eagles. They're two big tackles are not there in the middle Devontae Williams takes advantage of that Five yards to the 38 yard long And Javante Williams was actually drafted by Vic Fangio, the defensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles. And, Mike, we got to watch some tape on him during the course of the week from his rookie year in 2021. He made some of the most spectacular plays we saw that season. And if he's anywhere close back to that form, he's really going to be a value for the Dallas Cowboys. He'll go to the left here. In game three, one with a 41-yard line with third and a couple coming up. Andrew McCuba, John Campbell. The rookies over there making the tackle. He's more pushing and shoving after the play. Now being separated. Vic Fangio knows about Javante Williams. Had him when he was the head coach at Denver this year, too, for Vic as the defensive coordinator here in Philly. Yeah, he was talking about how special he was that first year before he heard his name. And Mike, we have seen every single snap, I think, C.D. and George Pickens on opposite sides of the field trying to stretch that defense. Tight formation here on third and two. Prescott scanning and throws complete to Lamb, who came across the field. And C.D. Lamb takes it right around the 30-yard line. Effective start for C.D. Lamb here in the opener. One of the big questions coming into this one was whether or not Tyler Booker right here was going to be able to hold up against Jalen Carter. Well, guess what? That really never happened in this game. So huge advantage for the Dallas Cowboys breaking in their new right guard. 26 of those lands, 76 yards on the last catch. Yeah! And everybody, ice coffee, ice coffee! Miles Sanders the back off in time. Prescott, there's a different flag down as the pass is complete to the 30-yard line. To Sanders, seventh-year man out of Penn State. Holden, offense number 73, senior penalty, first down. No problem calling that one. That was pretty easy right there. Tyler Smith got beat right off the ball and as soon as it happened he knew it was over for him and he simply just made a tackle And it was a good decision for him Got a hand on Byron Young Alabama Raiders, Smith, you see how good he was whenever he was out of tackle early on in his career but moved inside to guard going to stay there now and a really solid player inside. Final two minutes in his opening quarter. Prescott has to get away. Sanders has it. Zach Bond in the open field brings him down. Loss of three. Zach Bond went from a special teamer and an edge rusher to an all-pro linebacker last year. And one of the things that Zach Bond does absolutely best is bring down people in the open field. A remarkable story. He was never an off-the-ball linebacker. He played on the edge and rushed the passer for the New Orleans Saints for multiple years. Comes here, they try. After his pass rush, Adoree Jackson in coverage. Best play of the night for Adoree Jackson, and it was a big one. A little bit of a late, poorly timed throw. CD, oh, it was almost picked off by Young on the outside. Ball was late getting there and Adoree Jackson made his first big play of the night third and ten might get Pickens one-on-one with Mitchell down here they've been playing a little of that Scott looking left going Pickens ends on Pickens and justing and incomplete and Mitchell were involved again. No flag, fourth down, field goal attempt to come. It definitely got a little interesting right about there. I think they were sort of pushing almost equally, and the officials probably saw the same thing, so no call. First time for either team that a third down was not converted in this one, and here is Aubrey sensational leg good accuracy from 41 yards Brandon Aubrey knocks it through in the Cowboys back on top here in this one 34 to go for Hertz and the Eagles back into the first half in February starts in this game five drives five scores Aubrey trying to put one in play this time he does and gets a little bit of a bobble on it so the return comes shy of the 20-yard line for Shipley with the hit to the Miley of foul. All right let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS and you know what this offense has been powered by it has been Jalen Hurts and his legs all night long. They don't have a pass completed over eight yards and yet it has been play after play when they had to have it Jalen Hurts has simply pulled it down and you can see the man coverage running around behind they're doing their best to match up with these receivers but they have yet to match up with the running skills of Jalen Hurts coming down field in passing game only eight yards the longest reception for Goddard no targets of AJ Brown yet getting it done on the ground the night Team Barkley left. Waiting arms of Sam Williams. Important player on this Dallas team this year. Yeah, and we're seeing the rotation along the defensive line of the Dallas Cowboys. They're going to use Marshawn Nealon and Sam Williams on early downs. And then Dante Fowler and Ezra Raku is more of the pass rush kind of situation. So they're trying to keep these guys fresh in there. They're trying to find a way to fill in for what they're missing. Yeah, they are. Michael Parsons. Hello, Green Bay. Second and six on the other side of the two-minute warning. You're watching the NFL kickoff presented by YouTube TV. Back with you in Philly. Coming up on the T.O. to Halftime, we'll break down a chippy first half here in the Finnegan Financial Field and look ahead to an MVP showdown at Buffalo Sunday night. Mike, back to you. All right, Maria. See you and the guys at Halftime. Great to have our old Football Night in America team on hand. Nightly news. Today's show as well, last couple of days. It's fun to have the whole NBC family here for kickoff game 2025. Second and six for Hertz. Flushed. Chase by Williams. And he'll just bench it. Threw it to the sideline. Third down. I'll tell you, the one thing I did not expect out of this first half is that we would see no passes really thrown to the outside to the wide receivers of the Philadelphia Eagles. I mean you have Devontae Smith and AJ Brown for them to at this point only have one catch for six yards Against a secondary that is coming off of injuries. I just thought we'd see more But now is a moment for this Dallas defense. They have that third and six that they have been begging for And hurts with time now shaft downfield Taking it down to the 26-yard line. Dodson able to pull it in. 51 on the plug. Well, they're just as happy with Jahan Dodson getting the opportunity against Kair Elam. And it wasn't that Elam wasn't there, but you've got to be able to make those plays on the ball. And the Eagles just continue to fly down the field. From the 26, Mertz, Elam trying to check it down. Barkley didn't take the ball. Here he is constantly making plays just like that. These guys want to hide. First and goal, Philly. Barkley back in. Left side, Saquon. The yards. Mark him down near the three. Second and goal. Closing in on that area where Philly's so effective. Power running inside the five. And now it's just a matter of what Nick Sirianni wants to do. I mean, theoretically, he could take his quarterback and just run three of those plays there. But I would think they would not want to run him quite as much until it was 100% needed. And you've got Saquon Barkley right behind him. Really no need. They're going to go. Barkley inside. And the Cowboys surge with Solomon Thomas. due to Dallas last three years with the Jets. Played for San Francisco and the Raiders as well in there on the stop. Kenneth Murray in there as well. And one of the things that they have to do with Kenneth Murray now as more of a speed linebacker is exactly what he did there. Get through the initial line of scrimmage. It's not his job to take on 330-pound offensive linemen. He's got to use his speed to get around him, and he did it there. Three receivers to the top. The motion man is Johan Dotson. Third and goal. Hurts has time. Takes off. Jalen Hurts. Touchdown, Philadelphia. The biggest job for any quarterback in the NFL to convert on third down and convert in the red zone. You want to throw a touchdown pass? Great. You want to run it in the end zone? Great. This guy is tremendous at doing both. Pass rush handled. Sands Parsons. Perched to the end zone. Now Jake Elliott. Two drives. Two touchdowns. Jump right into the deep end of this season. Taylor Hurston so well the end of last year picks up where he left off all time at seven and you're watching the NFL kickoff presented by YouTube TV four miles down Broad Street here in South Philly the link as well time seven away from him but he can't and it's taken by Interpret from the three and the return will stop him at about the 23-yard line and Melissa that's where Jack Prescott the Cowboys offense Once the fist to cuffs end with Marist Leah foul with a helmet off Fisticas are gonna and flags everywhere Welcome back to Cowboys Eagles. We've got four different flags after the scrub we have found his helmet was off he was right in the middle of it 35 the other name linebacker leopold was definitely working the helmet had the face mask and was trying to work it off but his was already off so it's hard to tell what happened to him first Again a lot of tone setting with these teams to blow out wins With Prescott missing both games for Dallas last year But doesn't matter the records with the current records with teams and Cooper to gene looked like he was the one that was Grabbed the face mask couldn't tell if he was actually the one that took it off But then it was Leah foul trying to do the same back to him There's two personal fouls on the play, both against Dallas. Personal foul, unnecessary weakness. Receiving team, number 35 and number 14. Half the distance, Finley, first down. They'll take Dallas back deep in their own territory. You saw DeGene, the first one, but very often as it's tight in there, second one is the one who gets caught. Dallas Philly, here we go. And this is exactly, we've been talking about this all week. The shot that the Dallas Cowboys had was that this offense really was sort of put together. And that they were going to be able to run the football enough to set up their passing game, which is what they did on that first drive, hitting that big pass to CeeDee Lamb down inside the five. Now can they continue with the run game? That's the most important question. It's been made a lot easier with Jalen Porter. Double move is so hard. When Vaughn is right here in the middle, watch the move in front of his face. The double move didn't end behind. Now he's got to try and figure it out. Hits him right on the back of the helmet. But only because his speed now, two times on this drive, has saved big plays. second and 22 Eagles fans rise in the end zone to our left it is short for Javante Williams and will bring up third down deflected we've seen Jihad Campbell make a few plays now He had to stop on that middle read and look like the big guy inside Jordan Davis Who lost 36 pounds so he could play more? He didn't know he's got to play as much as he did tonight when his buddy got thrown out of the game But another big play out of him and his offseason work paying off for the Eagles now Eagles with a three-man defensive front here Keep the Cowboys in front of them third and 22 press gun to try the middle and it is a penalty as Ferguson got hit by Blankenship Ferguson got his hands on it gets up right away but Blankenship forearm across the head to a defensive defenseless receiver Unnecessary, personal foul defense, number 32. 14-yard penalty, automatic, goes down. So two of the biggest plays of this game now have been penalties on the Eagles' defenders that have kept drives alive. That catch was not going to be made. Of course, Blankenship had no idea. He was just trying to get there and get contact. And Dak saying, hang in there, baby. But, you know, this is Dak Prescott being really aggressive, too. I mean, he is not settling for anything. When they backed up on their own 10-yard line at the end of the half, he was going for it. Here he was, third and 20. It's throwing the end zone. Let's go. We're playing the Eagles. 105 penalty yards for Philadelphia. From the 11-yard line, Sanders. Ball out! Picked up by Quinone Mitchell and down at the 16-yard line. Big play on the drive to get him down there for Sanders. And the former Eagle with a hand in there from Byron Young forces it out and Mitchell recovers the game's first turnover. Two sets of hands on there. It slides out. Confirmed as a turnover. First drive without points in this game. Eagles take over. Up four. Defense loves it. Touch wood. The delay, one hour and five minutes. We get back to work. And remember the last play. Dallas was driving for a touchdown. And a fumble recovery for the Eagles. So Philly is set first and ten at their own 16. They've scored on all four drives they've had tonight. Barkley to the left, loss of a yard. And Kenny Clark among the group, along with Jack Sanborn and company, in on that tackle. Is that the first play that we've seen the running back of the Philadelphia Eagles get hit at the line of scrimmage like that? I mean, I don't know what they talked about in there at whatever second halftime. That was a good start. And now you've got to wake yourself up. This is a big game. This is a divisional game. If somehow the Cowboys come out of here with a win, I mean, it's franchise shaking. A little buzz out of the building at the moment. Pressure on second 11. Prescott gets away from one. Resets and throws it away at the line of scrimmage. Barkley, an eligible receiver in the area. The corner blitz from Trayvon Diggs, former college teammate of Hurts, changes that. Yeah, right off the edge, you're going to see the pressure come. And one of the things that Dallas thought they could get away with here was if they could force Jalen Hurts to look away from his first target. They wanted him to pull the ball down and find number two. They felt like if they could do that, they could push it twice. When you go, we're going to win the game with our best play. May not be able to get it the first time, but I haven't seen them stop them for a yard or yard and a half yet. On target to Brown. Seven of the 19 completions. Two receivers here tonight. But also remember Landon Dickerson not in there. And you're making the transition from Makai Becton from a year ago. Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Eagles, watches as well. Third and two. Eagles have it spread out. Trying to get a first down to close it out. And they go empty. Better spy. Hurts looking to take off. Hurts has the first down. Jalen Hurts does it with his legs, which took care of those early drives. Dallas takes their final timeout. When you go empty, you just have so many bodies in here. I thought they might be spying right there, but they did not. They set the tight end down to get right in front of Sanborn. but when you go empty against the Philadelphia Eagles, you just know what's coming. When the money is on the line, when the game is on the line, Jalen Hurts is going to run the ball. Everybody knows it, and they still can't stop it. Like you said, third downs. Third downs, and he is taking care of business on third downs tonight. Chevrolet postgame coming up. Melissa interviews the stars of the game. We'll look ahead to our Sunday night game in Orchard Park. all Philadelphia needs to do have a disaster with the snap and look at it opening that way shoving there as Williams went into Calcaterra the tight end it started chipping it ends on edge throw him out CD land and the Cowboys put up a good fight here on opening night kind of one of those he knows he's made some of those plays before and probably will pretty darn soon again as well but not tonight Those hurt. And I mean, this was a great opportunity for the Dallas Cowboys. A great opportunity to come in here and knock off the world champs. And Brian Schottenheimer knows it. This was a missed chance from stars and playmakers that ordinarily make those plays. And on opening night, Philly and Dallas delivers. And the champs get win one. Good luck the rest of the world. Watch out, guys. Coaches exchange greetings. We'll see each other week 12 in Arlington. But win one of the season. It was the team that won the last one last season. Took a while. Got testing. But in the end, the champs get the win. Eagles 5-4. Chevrolet postgame coming up right after these messages. You get pressure on them. And maybe now they have that formula. Bring some pressure out of the secondary. You have not seen a punt in the game tonight. It's 3rd and 11 Philadelphia. Showing corner pressure again and bringing it. Prescott got away from it. He's got space. Prescott. Great pursuit. Denies him the first time. Great pursuit stops him at the 23-yard line, and they'll punt it away. Well, what we've seen from Jalen Hurts is that he's been making them pay with his legs, but now they're bringing the blitz, but they're not playing man coverage the way that they were in the first half. They're playing zone behind it. So now on third and ten, if he takes off the run, they've got time to rally, make the tackle and finally we see a punter in this game. Yeah, Brayden Mann for the first time, third year with the Eagles. Set to kick it away. Good hang time. Dangerous return, Mann Turpin, but he makes it fair catch. So a great kick by Mann and Turpin fair catches it at the 26-yard line and that's where now Dak Prescott will get on the field to take over for Dallas. Yeah, and I think Dak Prescott is starting to feel this a little bit. Have we got a chance to come in here and knock off the world champs? And the ball's in our hands right now. We've been moving it all night. Let's go down and take the lead this time. No fumbles, no interceptions. Don't have any holding calls. We know we can move the ball on these guys And those fans heard from a little bit Javante Williams inside with a run They keep the pile pushing forward from four yards to the 30 line Seems to be some physicality from the Dallas side in the first four snaps after the delay. It's a really good job by the offensive line just getting in behind Williams and keeping that play alive. We've seen that a couple of times here tonight. Not the tush push. The Cowboys getting it done with three guys named Tyler Tyler Booker Tyler Smith Tyler Guyton all first-round picks All on that offensive front for Dallas Play made determine what the Cowboys season is like Prescott pressure got it away and throws it low but complete to Ferguson on the again of five yards Safety Andrew McCuba was there to make the stop. It's third and one coming up for the Cowboys Nolan Smith coming off the edge right there was supposed to be blocked by the backside door pulling out and yet wasn't able to get there but I tell you the way this game is going right now I've got to think this is probably pour down territory for the Dallas Cowboys they've been running it very well In the gun, and they've essentially got the backfield emptied out, and Prescott's going to throw underneath, and Lamb's got the first down, and C&A will take it to the 49-yard line with Zach Vaughn and Dory Jackson. Bring them down, but it's a first down for Dallas. Great job as they bring pressure here. That's an easy throw to get in for Dak Prescott, and decided to throw a little pressure back at Dak on that one, and it just blew up in his face. So that's the second or third time tonight we have seen the Eagles, who didn't blitz a whole lot last year, but now they're almost being forced into it without Jalen Carter and some of the guys they had on this defense a year ago. And 200 yards. Side run, William, 48-yard line. Pickup of about three in the final minute. This third quarter Yeah, the Cowboys have spent a lot of resources on this offensive line Tyler guy number one big tires fifth number one pick BB a third round Tyler Booker a number one pick So they are trying to go back to the days of the Dallas Cowboys When they could turn around and hand the football to Emmitt Smith and let him go to work And so far at least in this game without Jalen Carter. They've been able to do it It's a good and seven. Set it up for CeeDee Lamb. He's got some blocking, but on the inside, Philadelphia, all over that. Turns it into a loss, and Jordan Davis has had to play a lot in this one. Comes up with a stop that will make it third and ten for the start of quarter number four. Only scoring a Philadelphia field goal. Hour 4 weather delay in that quarter as well. But we go to the fourth with a tight game. Eagles 24, Cowboys 20. As you're watching the NFL kickoff presented by YouTube TV. Third and ten, down four to the Eagles. That's two. That's two in the second half that he has not been able to hold on to. Wow. Second and ten. In time. The traffic. That throw is incomplete. That one was in harm's way for Luke Schoonmaker. Cooper DeGene. The second year star, Nickel. Right now the Eagles are just coming with that four-man pressure. And for C.D. Lamb, he's sick. He had a chance to flip this game with a play that was tailor-made for him. He just doesn't drop those balls. 3rd and 10. Prescott, up and open, comes back underneath. Williams, a nice catch. Decision time. Shy of the 45. Need to get to the 48. Closing in on the 2-minute warning. What do they do? I think you go for it. Jump the ball right away here. They still have all three timeouts remaining and the 2-minute warning. If they get this play off in time, Let's take it down to the two-minute warning, see if they've got the free five with the offside. That'll reset to two as we hit the two-minute warning here in Philadelphia. We had points on the first eight drives. We've only had points on one of the last six as Dallas tries to work. If he goes spread, he would have an opportunity to pick this first down up. We haven't seen him run, though. Two-minute warning gives the Eagles pass rush a chance to recharge. Fourth and three. They're bringing pressure, at least showing it. And they are bringing it. And Prescott's locking it. CD couldn't bring that one in either. Third time in the half. Eagles take over on downs. Dab knew what he was doing as soon as they brought the pressure. Here come the blitzers. They were going to come get him, which meant one-on-one on the outside. Who's your best player? Here it comes. Hard catch, but catchable. Tough catch. Yeah, tough one. You got it. So game not over although CD just so frustrated with what has happened since the break a couple of opportunities Again, Dallas all three timeouts can get the ball back if they can stop Philly with about a minute Once again Sam Williams off the edge in on the play CD lamb heading towards the medical tent here as the Cowboys take the first time out at 150. Don't know what happened to CD, but Dak Prescott has to be a little sick of the opportunities that have been presented that they have not converted on. This is the first one in that drive. And he had the one on the crossing route. And that is just a tough catch. Yes, that's that's a tough play out that one doesn't go down in the drop category for me Second down coming up Philadelphia again stopped on the first down run which has been one of the themes since the break really has been but CD is gonna catch one pretty soon. So you gotta get the first down here Let's get it done here. They're gonna throw on second down He stays in bounds with momentum forcing Schottenheimer to use his second timeout before third and two. And these knowledgeable fans know it had been quiet for A.J. He gets on the board with a grab and a chemo. You know, it's really interesting coming up to this next one. That ball is a yard and a half or so short. Is this the opportunity now where you just push? Pattern for Prescott, throwing in the middle and strapped him off the hands of Lamb. And incomplete. A lot of traffic in there. They cannot connect. And Dallas will punch it away for the first time. Kevontae Turpin got jammed at the line of scrimmage, and so he was unable to clear the space in the middle for C.D. Lamb. Just good defense, not giving the free release. He was jammed up front, but then it just forced a lot of bodies into that area where CD was coming and it went right through his hands. First kick for Brian Anger. Jahan Dotson is back to handle the putt returning. And an NFL putt return. Did it in college at Penn State. Signals four. It makes the fair catch. Right around the 13th where Philadelphia will take over. We'll be back at the link in 30 seconds. Via huddle, 42 plays run for the Eagles. Brown has not been targeted yet tonight. He's not had a game where he has had zero targets. This hurts his 13 of 16 in the air, but six of those 13 completions to Dallas Goddard is tight end. But I'll also say this, that we have seen Saquon Barkley in the second half, and in particular the fourth quarter of games, just having pounded all night long, break some big runs, and win football games for the Eagles. Right out here to the left. Hurts looks right. Coverage comes back to Barkley. 20-yard line. How do you feel them down there? Melissa. Yeah, Mike, the Cowboys defensive players, when they were coming back onto the field after the weather delay, were yelling to each other, unleash us. Then we saw that quick three and out that they got, and they went to the sidelines after that. They were dancing. They were all smiles, and they said, that is how you throw the first punch. they did, to say the least, in the third portion of this game, if you will. Well, and they started bringing some pressure, too. And I think that's what the players were talking about. Second and two. Inside with Barkley. And that's again tied up with Marshawn Nealon. That second-round pick out of Western Michigan in his second year. Been around it a lot tonight. He sure has, and that shows up as well. He had an issue with his knee last year, so you just wondered which kneeling were we going to see. The guy they obviously drafted him in the second round, you're expecting big things. And so far tonight, that's exactly what we've got, especially in the run game. First push, push, formation of the night. Played, pecked in the game, third and one. Go, go, go. It was a deck. It's first. moves toward the line. Let's see where that spot comes in. And the initial indication from the down judge, Jay Bilbo is to move the chains for a first down as those Eagles interior linemen peel themselves off the ground. First down, Philadelphia, of course, push-push in the news in the offseason. The vote to try to keep it out of the game, it was kept in by two votes. There's the four guys. The strategy for the Cowboys was to come around here and knock off these two pushers and pull backwards on the legs of Hertz. Didn't work that time. And we have a flag down. A couple of them in the secondary. Probably too many Cowboys. Looks like a lot of silver helmets. Four players on the field. Defense. Five-yard penalty. First down. So almost stopping Philadelphia. The Eagles get the first down on the ground. Now they'll have first and short to operate with here starting this fourth quarter. Cowboys have had some chances. Had the one with the fumble down there. They have possession with a chance to go take the lead. As great as they played in the first half on offense, we haven't seen much here since. So first and five for Jalen Hurts. And Barkley with a block from the tight end. Branson, yard shy of the first down, looks like the mark will be. That's a 32-yard lot. And remember the Eagles in this game, Ben Van Sumeren, their fullback really was knocked out on the first opening kickoff, and so they're having to adjust, and now they've got Branson in there playing some fullback because they want to go with some power football. A number that was just up there, what you alluded to, Chris. Saquon, with all the rushing success over 2,000 yards last year, 2005, doing a lot of it after halftime. Here he is again. Because it feels like Dallas is getting on that other side of the offensive line since the weather stoppers. Yeah, and I think what we're seeing is just some stunts and some play inside. You could tell some of these guys, it's basically Solomon Thomas there just on the stunt, spun in and then spun back out and was able to make the play. The problem is you think your chances of stopping this push push almost zero, but let's see again. They're going to fly off the edges and try to get the leg of Jalen Hurts after they whack those two pushers. Go, go, go. Second push from the powerful Hurts takes them to the first down at the 33-yard line. Again, the vote was 24. The votes needed to get it out of the game. The vote was 22-10 at the league meetings. And what is Mike Tyson's there? Everybody has a plan until you get hit in the mouth. That's kind of what the tush push does to you. And it's humiliating. And for the Dallas Cowboys, defenses just hate it when they can't stop the run. I'm telling you, it just eats at them. And right now, the Philadelphia Eagles are trying to just punch them time and time again. And that's how they win football games, especially late. First downs with the Tush Push. Get it on the edge. Devontae Smith works back to the inside. And game seven. Melissa. Yeah, Mike, Jordan, my lot of laughs as he told me his feelings were split 50-50. That the Tush Purs wasn't banned this season. Saying, I want to run it. But at the same time, I don't. Because it's really hard. He acknowledges the sheer mass on the offensive line is a huge part of the success. But running it two, three, four times a game is taxing. He said, have the camera zoom in on my face after the fifth time. You'll see my excitement. We got three to go. He's run it twice. Got it both times. Second and three is Araku off the edge. Barkley to one-hand catch. Barkley the stiff arm. Barkley the first down. Offensive player of the year. On full display. He was also voted the number one player on that player's poll. And look at the one-handed catcher coming across in the backfield. Reaches out that one hand. Makes the play. Wasn't enough. Got a chip. Handled that. Makes somebody miss. There you go. He's so good. So good. On the ground. Caught behind the line of scrimmage. A great read by James Houston. With the Lions, had a great run of sacks back in 2022. Wasn't able to stay healthy or be impactful as an edge rusher. Made a good play there for a loss. This guy had eight sacks in seven games as a rookie. And watch him go inside the block there of Milata and then still enough speed to get out and make that play. So they've got a lot of pieces here. That's what they said, Mike. They felt like the greatest depth they had on the team was at the edge. And so maybe they could survive without Micah Parsons. I'm not sure they're making the same argument after this one, although that one helped. Play clock was running down. Hurts forced to take Philadelphia's first time out of this second half. He comes at 8.26 to go with the Eagles plus four. A moment Landon Dickerson the Pro Bowl left guard is also out of the game for the moment for Philadelphia Brett Toth is in there at guard for Dickerson who had a knee injury and then also was on their injury report with a back This week second and 14 for Hertz Helds. Helds and opens. Hurts escapes. Chased by Williams and throws it to the bench. And incomplete. Melissa, what about the Philly injury? Yes, so before the weather delay, we were watching Landon Dickerson. He came off the field grimacing in a ton of pain. The head athletic trainer and the orthopedic surgeon were looking at his lower back. They examined that. They used the massage gun. He never sat down. Remember, he only practiced two times this week because of that back. Now, after the weather delay, he did not participate in those warm-offs that they had on the field. He was stretching on the side. So, certainly this is something that's bothering him. Yeah, an important piece of that offensive line. Heading back, big Dom, athletic training staff, Philly personnel. Big third down here with 8.18 to go. Hurts, deep drop, the time goes complete, short of the first down. As Goddard is gang-tackled again. Trayvon Diggs over there as well right at midfield. Hurts looking over to the sideline with fourth and four. And will they go? With the way these offenses have been. As the back of those inside runs, Chris have been shut down here in this second half and had the absence of Dickerson to that now. Man, look at all the defenders, the Dallas Cowboys. They're just going to come up and say, we're taking away Saquon Barkley. Look at this. The number of bodies up here and they're all flying across the line of scrimmage and don't forget now that Brett Toth Is in there playing the other guard position? So if you're gonna attack and maybe confuse the group that hasn't been in there together You might rather attack inside right now rather than the edges first first look covered escaping left and he goes out of bounds as well pushed there on the sideline Williams was in pursuit looked like that hand was on him before he got to the white Off the sideline. Third down coming. Good call, and they need a good call right here, too. This is the biggest play of the game. Not often you get this offense backed up like this, and what we saw in the first half is when this happened, we got the scramble, and we got Jalen Hurts out making plays. Job one now is don't let him escape. Four in the pattern. There's the flush man chasing. It is punched after the catch. Dotson is stopped. Johan Dotson hit at the 30s around Blatt. Kyrie Elam been all right here in his cowboy debut. And Philly will punch it away with 335 to go. Going to end up getting a loop around here. So as the scramble begins to happen, they've got accountability all the way across. Get the spy in that situation and able to go all the way across the field there to force the completed pass, but no first down. A nice adjustment from Matt Eberfluss, the defensive coordinator. Mann has not let Turpin return it twice here. sprinting to get his hands on that and cannot. And you can see his frustration, but do not forget the contributions of Brayden Mann. Three great kicks. 3-0-2 to go. Three timeouts. Dak and Dallas down four. 3-0-2, Dallas down four. All three timeouts. I'm staying in two minutes. This is already a very thin defensive line. I don't want them substituting one time until I get to the two-minute warning. And I want those guys out there playing. But plenty of time. The Cowboys can run the ball. They can do anything they want. Monta Williams, the back. Caught by Ferguson. Out of bounds with Zach Bond covering at the 23-yard line. You talk about the absence of Carter inside. Jordan Davis has been on the field a lot. Ferguson, terrific. Full one-handed grab there. Sure was. That was a gutsy throw on the part of Prescott as well, but a good drive starter for them. We may have to see Dak run the football a little bit here, too, before it's done. Hancuk by the snap, hit as he throws, almost intercepted. Whoa, that was problem times three. Snap, pressure, and near pick. Called it. Good catch, and then he threw it into traffic one more time. and CD slipped and Quignon just about should have had it. Should have been game over. Now third and five. Four-man pressure picked up. Prescott's throw is caught by George Pickens at the sideline. First down, Dallas at the 38th. One thing you always see out of Pickens is he extends his arms to make catches. If he did not hear, he would have had that ball stripped out of his hands. But as he is able to stretch out, it's why you see him make so many of those contested catches because he extends the arms and makes the play. Holds for a second with the officials. Now they let it go here. Got out of bounds and the clock was stopped. He's 47. Prescott looking middle. Cover coming downfield for a win! CD couldn't hang on! Ricocheted to Blankenship's hands. What a throw by Dak Prescott. And it hits CD right in the hand. Going, not in the second half, but before. You certainly are at least going to go hard count here and see what happens. But I think they're actually going for it I don't think I think you want Dallas having the ball was seven minutes to go and a chance to go win the game with their office Offside we give a first down And there is the delay game Five-yard penalty fourth down now they'll try to pin them with the punt so interesting after nobody could be stopped with all the scores every possession in that first half with the field goal to start the second half and nothing since and Braden man try to play keep away with Kevontae Turpin the uber dangerous return man for the Cowboys Wow It's a wobbler tough to catch. Turpin can't get his hands on it. So well done by Brayden Mann. Two good punts that Turpin couldn't return. One because of hang time. That one because of direction. Cowboys have it at their own 13. Past halfway here in the fourth. Philadelphia. The latest version of the Sunday night anthem with Carrie Underwood. Year 13 of her doing that. Look forward to seeing that right before kickoff for the Bills and Ravens on NBC. Prescott starting from his own 11th. C.D. Lamb having a night out of bounds. First down right around the 23 as Lamb catches his seventh of the evening. Yeah, we might be getting some entertaining action going on down there now because we're seeing C.D. matched up one-on-one against Quignon Mitchell, and those are two of the really top-end players in the league. Let's see how much they stay with that. From the 24, Williams inside. The pressure erases any hope. Jay Lich Hunt had it on a lot of this Philadelphia team this year with the penetration for the loss of a company. You can see Hunt just jump right inside the block here and be able to make that play in the backfield. That was really big because it was starting to feel like Dallas might have a little something going. Put the ball back in the hands of Dak now and really feel like these receivers are going to have to go win the football game for Dallas if they're going to get it done. Prescott heading it up to that left side. Kermit made one man miss, but no more than that. They were waiting for him with Guba, the safety, Campbell, the rookie linebacker. The first and second round picks combined there from Philly. And once again, it's the pressure. It has been the difference really in this half. Vic Fangio has been consistently bringing pressure. That time from the linebacker position, Dak had to get rid of it. Now they're in third and long. That five-man pressure has really flipped this game here. the second half. Third and ten, CeeDee Lamb is starting, standing on the end. And Dak, deep drop, pressured again, floats it, Williams. Three Eagles are there, and after a first down on the first play, Philadelphia's defense steps up, and Dallas will punch it away. And that time no good. This is just a four-man pressure up here. This Cowboys offensive line has to be able to hold up. That was a fairly simple stunt. The rookie, Tyler Booker, was late getting off to make the play and simply forced Dak to throw it away sooner than he wanted to. Brian Enger kicks to Jahan Dotson. Hang time here Dotson fair catch of a 48-yard kick 25-yard line So the Eagles will have it 443 to go Can they run out the clock And clinch a victory On opening night Jones and the Cowboys To get a road victory in this opener against the defending champion Eagles. Gene sitting there as well. Philadelphia from the 24-yard line.
