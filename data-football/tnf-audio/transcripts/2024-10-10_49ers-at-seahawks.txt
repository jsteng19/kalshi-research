 Matthew Wright, who's the new 49er kickoff when Moody got hurt last week. And his opening kick is a short one that bounces at the 10. And his run back out past the 20. Still on his feet to the 35-yard line. But this is Chenault. So a nice run back after a short kick. And here comes Geno Smith, who leads the league in passing yardage. 1,466. He's thrown five touchdown passes, one in each game, and four picks. And, of course, in his 12th season, quite the odyssey for Smith. Former Jet, former Giant, former Charger, and now he's come into his own in Seattle. Kenneth Walker is the running back. They need to run the ball a lot more than they did last week when Walker only had five carries against the Giants. And they start right away with him, and he takes the ball up to the 39-yard line game to three. Malik Collins making the stop. You know, this new offensive scheme, you not only have a new head coach, obviously you bring in some new coordinators. And Ryan Grubb, who's actually the Washington Husky offensive coordinator, he led them all the way to the national championship. He takes over. I'm talking to a lot of people this week, Sam Fran especially, said, boy, you're going to get a lot of tempo tonight. Reminds me of a lot of college offenses as far as how fast they can go and they're going to spread you all over the field and give Geno Smith a chance to read those defenses and make quick throws. Second down and seven. On the ground again. Breaking the tackle. That picks up a couple more. Nick Bosa making the tackle there on Walker. You know, the Seahawks coming into this game averaging 40 passes per game. Yeah, and that has to change. I mean, it's great that Geno Smith has been able to put up some big numbers, and he seems to be in command of this new system. But for this offense to really work, you've got to take pressure off of the offensive line, especially the right side. You're working in a third guy at right tackle in Stone Forsythe. By running the ball, you can slow down Bosa and his defensive pressure. Trips to the right. Charbonnet is the back on third down. Smith looking to throw for the first time and completes it. And into 49 of territory. DK Metcalf. Big game on a third down and six over the middle to Metcalf, and that's a game of 30 yards. And this is what the Niners like to do is pressure just using the four. There's Bosa against Forsythe. Watch how he hops up, avoids the pressure, and then keeps his eyes downfield and hits Metcalf. They go quickly, no huddle. 49ers minus Traverius Ward, the cornerback. That's a big loss for them. They've got a number of losses on that defense. We're with a balky knee inactive tonight. We're going to see a lot of Isaac Yadam in his place. Meanwhile, a draw here, and this is Sherman A. He gets to the 26-yard line. Stopped there by Brown, second and six. You mentioned that injury. Ward's one of the best corners in the league. Very physical, likes to press. And now you see Renardo Green, who will step in, because they're going to have to be a nickel with five defensive backs in three corners out there. There's a look at Ward, who I'm sure will be trying to help Green out as much as he can. But Green, 0, 22, Yadam. And then also Lenore, who's playing that nickel tonight when they're in five DBs. Green just come out. Zero, number zero. Here's Walker to the outside. Breaks a tackle. And gets away for the moment from Bosa, but only a short gain. And another third down coming up for the Seahawks. The most underappreciated aspect of Nick Bosa's game is, first of all, the stance is beautiful. But defending the run and setting the edge to this defense. Everybody knows what kind of pass rusher he is, but you see how he uses his hands, looks into the backfield, keeps the leverage to the defense, keeps him from getting outside of him or just getting that strength, forces him back inside, and there's the rest of the Niners defense able to chase him down. Trips to the left this time. Hands in the pocket. Fires. Too deep and intercepted at the one-yard line. Picked off by Malik Mustafa, who is taking the place of Hufanga. The great, strong safety. So Mustafa comes up with a big pick on an overthrown pass on a third down play, and San Francisco takes over. fifth pick of the season for Gino Smith 49ers with the ball and we come back one or two maybe for Jordan Mason who has taken over McCaffrey's role until Christian is ready offense is struggling to kind of find themselves and they get into that two minute hurry up and it just clicks you're one pass away from getting Gino Smith to feel comfortable in the pocket and start zoning in on his reads and making accurate throws, and that's what we've seen here on this drive. They've got a chance here. They still have the one timeout down to the 22-yard line. And with these receivers, you always can find an opportunity to make a play and get into that end zone. Remember, the Niners get the ball to start the second half. Absolutely. Big, big drive here, second and one. See if they can pay it off. caught first down and a lot more Smith and Jigman in the 12 yard line Gino had to get that one away in a hurry because Bosa came in a free runner yeah they kind of struggle to block him bring him towards you and then throw the ball over top of him with a screen to the receiver I think he got in there a little bit quicker with that .67 than maybe Gino Smith was thinking but he was ready for it and then you got the convoy out in front Get that ball both the linebacker and Bosa in on that rush. So now they're down to the 12-yard line after that 10-yard gain. But out of timeouts. Drive started back at their own 29-yard line. Eighth play of the drive. Rush 4. Smith on the move. Flag. Coverage that time on Noah Fant by Yadam and drawing the flag. And the Seahawks are going to be set up inside the 5. Pass interference. Defense in the 22. Finley Kerr at the 1-yard line. Seattle ball, automatic first down. That's a corner on a tight end. Matched up man-to-man, and he's grabbing on the whole time. Works to the outside. He's got a hold of that jersey. Right call and an easy call, so they're down at the two-yard line. Remember, no timeout, 16 seconds, quick decisions, tight windows here for Geno Smith. Who can win one-on-one? Where's the matchup? looking, throwing too high. Lockett was the intended receiver. Tyler Lockett yet to catch a pass tonight. The design was good because you had man-to-man coverage, and that was a man-beater to the left where you had two receivers, Jackson Smith and Jigba, and Lockett trying to run an out and a quick slant. The two defenders ran into each other, but just the timing off there with Geno and Lockett. Smith, second and goal, leaping up, broken up. Lenore, the Amador Lenore covering on the play. Smith and Jigba down to eight seconds, third and goal. What a matchup with these two. Lenore has got a great attitude. He loves to be challenged one-on-one with Jackson Smith and Jigba. Ball is thrown just a little bit late, and that's why it felt like it was behind. And you could see the left hand of Lenore come in there and knock that away. Well, he's tried Lockett. He's tried Lockett. He also tried Jackson Smith and Jigba. Who's he go to here on this third down? Last chance. Smith and Jigba in motion. Smith lost it again in the end zone. Hold in. No good, though. Metcalf fourth and goal three seconds you got Renardo Green the rookie covering I think Green interfered with him but this is going to be close it sure looks like he gets one down and then the second oh just a toe just a toe Proud sees it they think there's some green between the shoe and the chalk, but there isn't. And now they're going to settle for a field goal, and the crowd doesn't like this at all. There it is again. Clearly the toe comes down on the line. Now Myers for a 20-yard attempt, and the crowd not happy at all with that. Down the field they go. That ends the half. At least they get on the board to make it a 13-point deficit. 16-3. The three all the way. Only the second kickoff return for a TD in the league this season. DJ Dallas of Arizona had one earlier. Jason Myers for the extra point. and when things were very somber around here, all of a sudden, back to life. What a play. Anytime you have a big return, you've got to make the first guy miss. And that's exactly what he does with being able to avoid this man right here. Avoid him, bounce off of another guy. That was a big linebacker, Jalen Graham, and then it's just a foot race. So he makes the first guy miss with a great move. That was Mahoney right there. And then he bounces off who didn't wrap up, the linebacker, Graham. And then he looks around. There's nobody there. So finally, with these new rules changes, we're excited to see these kickoff returns. Al's been frustrated every single week. And there's a return right there, Al, just for you on Thursday night. Chenault takes it to the house. I'll tell you another guy that was for is the special teams coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks. Speaking of the Harbaugh family. There he is. He's fired up. Yep. Good call, coach. Gets the Hawks right back in the game. Chenault's a big physical receiver, 225-pounder. That strength came in handy, bouncing off of that would-be tackle. He's tired. So Jay Harbaugh, Jim's son. So McDonald comes up under John, spends a year with Jim. Kidd gets a break, and he's going to be as happy as anybody in the ballpark right now. That gets his team right back in the game. And the 49ers have an opportunity to run this one back. And Debo Samuel takes it out to the 31-yard line where they'll begin this next drive. So once again, the standings now in the NFC West. What's going into the season looked like it would be the toughest division in the league. Who knows at this point? Seattle 3-2. And again, if Seattle were to win the game, you think of San Francisco would be already two games back. Would be 0-3 in the division. So, obviously a big game for Seattle, but I think a bigger game for San Francisco. Yeah, I think that's why San Francisco has come out with, like we said, a sense of urgency on a short week. Patrick Taylor is the back. Throw it to him. Taylor. 12-yard gain. Dodson makes the tackle. How about Taylor, the fourth year out of Memphis? Everything's taken downfield away. The linebackers drop. Good job by Purdy. Just being patient here. No reason to get this ball forced down. Look at the linebackers clearing out. No problem. Just check it down. And then look at this. Bang. Lowers his shoulder. He's another big pack. 220-pounder. He wasn't bashful there. Yeah, there's Mason. Still trying to circulate that shoulder, trying to get back in the game. He was in for one play, the first play of the second half. Nonsense. Again. Garendo. Picks up a couple. Second down and eight. Good hustle there by Jaron Reed on that cutback from that outside zone play. We talked about the backside. There he is catching some oxygen. and that backside has to chase and make sure he doesn't have that cutback lane. Big fellow that time, a 300-pounder hustling down that line of scrimmage to make that tackle. Eight and a half left in the third. Purdy avoids the sack, throws, finds Ayuk, who got free. and he takes it to the 38-yard line. It's going to be a hold by Jake Grendel, the center, that will bring this play back. All the way back. Holding. Offense. Number 64. The 10-yard penalty replay. Second down. They brought the pressure. They're having a hard time getting pressure on him, so you'll see to the right it'll flash. Zero, the linebacker, Dotson right there in the center. 64. Clearly gets his arms wrapped around him and pulls him down. Good call by the official. Takes away a big gain for the 49ers. Makes it second and 18. 35-yard line. The first time this crowd. Using Iyuk, the corner follows him to the inside, and nobody's there on Deebo Samuel. Matthew Wright, extra point is good. 130 into the second quarter, and the 49ers are up 10-0 on the road. You take Ayuk into the inside. Corner goes with him. Watch the slight hesitation by one Samuel. He just kind of waits, waits, and then almost goes like on a rail route down that sideline. Nobody picks him up. Ball is thrown back, which is a great job by Purdy. Not leading him downfield with a safety. Could maybe get a hand on it. And watch Brock Purdy. Settle. Movement in the pocket. Feel. location is perfect Samuel fights back to that football and the Niners who 20 completions at 20 yards or more which is tied for the most with the Packers they hit another one for a big score up 10 to nothing gonna run it back here Chenault had a good run back on the opening pickoff it takes this one to the 30 the ball is loose 49ers all signal they have it here come the officials who's got it San Francisco the big question Al will be was he down when the ball came out I mean he was going towards the surface did they get a hand on it before he touches the ground yeah it's out that right knee touched but the ball came out Before that right knee hit. That is Darryl Luter who makes the contact. Dana Bethune with the recovery. Ball is coming out right there. Just before the knee hits. Much to the chagrin and displeasure of the crowd. Looking at the replay. and now the 49ers already up by 10 ruling is confirmed take over the 29 yard line a few second at fullback Mason for the 28, you know Kirk I'm looking at Brock Purdy and he says well you know he's got a great system and a great coach meanwhile he led the league in yards per pass last year. Leads again this year. I know a lot of people are going to say a lot of yards after contact, but when he airs it out, he's pretty damn good. Yeah, he's just a great extension of Kyle Shanahan. I mean, Kyle Shanahan, they took a chance on him. Remember, that was the year Trey Lance was supposed to be the guy. They took a chance on him because of all the work that they did leading into the draft. He's just a perfect fit for what they do in this offense. Very even-keeled guy. he'll get some extension next year meanwhile mason fights his way to the 23 i mean right now he's under a million bucks right yeah dak prescott is 60 million bucks i think he's gonna i think he's gonna do okay and i think kyle shenhan told us this week we talked to him he said you know the biggest thing you can say about him is he's just comfortable in his in his own skin and who he is as a person. Forget about football. Just his faith and everything about the way he carries himself. He doesn't really get caught up in all the noise or trying to prove people wrong. He's just trying to study this film and get ready to continue to be better in this offense. He's doing a hell of a job. Yeah, you saw that graphic. 81st highest paid quarterback in the league. Look out. Scrambles away. Avoids a big time sack and then fires it out of bounds. Fourth down. Saving a lot of yardage on the play. Leonard Williams was in front of him, chasing him. That was where the contact was, big 99. He made contact, but, you know, Brock Purdy, like any smart quarterback, as soon as you get touched, you just fall. Whether you get hit hard or not, he tried to draw the foul. But no foul, and a good stop by the Seahawks there. Well, here comes the new kicker. He threw it away, Matthew Wright. Scott Osler had a great comment on the San Francisco Final. He said the 49ers only hope. His nickname isn't wide. So Matthew Wright, 41-yard attempt. Right down the middle. Here in Seattle on a beautiful night. Not so beautiful for the Seahawks to this point, though. Niners on top, 13-0. So Chenault is back to receive the kick along with Dee Williams. Chenault had that fumble. And to come back, we don't know when. Yeah, that's right. And that interception was big because you were talking about a lot of those rookies who had to step up tonight. And Bosa got the pressure on the play. And sometimes it's not about the sack. You see Collins also getting pressure. See the rookie green in great tight man coverage. And there's Gustavo steps right in front of that overthrown ball for the pick. Second and nine. Off the fake. Purdy gets out of the backfield and then is taken down at the 12-yard line. Leonard Williams is there to secure it. Setting up a third down and two for San Francisco. Amazing. You and I were in this stadium two years ago. Brock Purdy had just taken over and everybody was wondering, is he a system quarterback? How good can he really be, Mr. Irrelevant? All of that talk. and here we are now in his third year really taking over this offense, even coming off the injury, the big year that he had a year ago, really established himself as a presence at that spot. Every football fan knows. Last guy picked in the draft, dancing around, trying to pick up that first down and does. Escaping a couple of times. And a first down for the 49ers up at their own 15-yard line. That's the aspect of his game that I feel like this year, We saw it a lot in college at Iowa State where he's a four-year starter. But I think more and more you're starting to see what he can do. The defense is concerned about him being the distributor, especially on third down. But his athletic ability and his strength in his lower body allows him to run through some of those arm tackles. Great presence of mine there to know where that first down marker was. Let away from Jerome Baker at the eight-yard line. Picks up the first. Running into traffic. but still keeping those legs churning is Jordan Mason. Jonathan Hankins is there. So Mason is a guy who was a free agent, played at Georgia Tech in his third year, and who could have figured that he would come in. He's the second leading rusher in the league right now. Yeah, it's been an amazing story. And over the years, you think about Mike Shanahan and now with Kyle Shanahan, you talk about it could be a journeyman back. It doesn't always have to be a top flight running back in their system. And here's another chapter in that story with Jordan Mason as an undrafted free agent, but runs very hard, very physical. On second and six, Debo Samuel fighting, churning, comes close to picking up the first down. So Debo on the move. Of course, the 49ers love a lot of motion. They love a lot of eye canning. That play, an illustration right there. And I feel like Debo Samuel's always been involved in the run game, but with Christian McCaffrey obviously still down. Mason, as much as we're bragging about what he's done, he's a very different style of runner from McCaffrey. So obviously you've got to lean more on Debo Samuel to kind of be that gadget guy to be able to get you some jet sweeps and reverses and things of that nature just to get the ball in his hands. Already rushed 16 times this season. You go with his 17 receptions. Third and one. Purdy fires open. Juggling makes the grab and then taken down is Samuel. So he runs for a few to set up a third and one. Caches this one. Bobbled it. Caught it. Has to come out for the moment. How about the call by Kyle Shanahan on third and short. Deep in your own territory. Everybody expecting with the formation and the personnel grouping. They're going to run the ball. No, they're not. Not with Kyle Shanahan. Ball is behind. And what an effort there by Samuel to get his right hand up and get able to kind of position it in front of him and then haul it in for that first down. But a great call again by Shanahan. Toss back. Nice hole. Breaking tackles. There goes Mason. Inside the 40. Witherspoon chasing him down. He can't get him. But at the very end, he is taken down after a great block early on by Trent Williams to spring him for a gain of 38. And this is San Francisco football right here. They get you to the outside. He's just going to kick out block here. Watch Banks also. This left side does a good job on this toss sweep. Just get outside. Try to find. Let him read that on its third step. Gets north and south. And that's where the physicality comes in. And those safeties and linebackers, with him coming downhill like that, That is a handful. Big, physical back, 225-pounder. Tight formation here. Samuel lines up as the eye back. Takes it. Through the middle, he goes. Sting around. Chenault this time. Brings it back out to the 30-yard line. See if Seattle can get Geno Smith, like we talked about, into that rhythm where he can get streaky. they've mixed up a lot of formations and personnel groupings they've been in a lot of 12 with one back and two tight ends I really thought with two rookies playing in this secondary Mustafa and Green I thought they might go a little bit more spread out, try to get those guys in space and try to beat them one on one in a good matchup from the 29 Geno 4 out of nine. A high snap brings it down. Start on the ground. Walker takes it to the 33-yard line. Second and seven. He was sacked last week. Geno Smith was seven times by big Dexter Lawrence and that Giants defense Burns. And I don't know if he's feeling that rush or looking at that rush instead of keeping his eyes downfield but they're doing a good job of keeping him off balance so far. Two-minute warning. Seattle trying to get something going with two minutes left in the half. And San Francisco up top. 16-yard. Our illustrious quintet. From what I hear. What else is new? Meanwhile, Mason has come back onto the sideline for the 49ers. Good news for them. Smith on second and seven. Finally finds the open man. Smith and Jigba. Gets into the action. First time tonight. Takes it across the 50. First down. Zone defense. Nice job of getting into that crease by Jackson Smith and Jigba. And that's the guy that I think could really have a night if they can locate him. Only the second target of the night. Seahawks have all of their timeouts remaining. Under a minute and a half here. Smith pressured look out from behind gets it away only for a minimal gain Walker that time Leonard Floyd in his first year as a 49er put the pressure on San Francisco has been really impressed with his approach coming over from Buffalo obviously a great pass rusher but they said he's just a Gritty just loves the process, loves defending the run, just all in. I know you've got all three timeouts here, but they've taken none. They're not moving with alacrity. You're under 50 seconds. Second and nine. Four-man rush. Launch deep. Getting free. Knocked away at the last moment. Metcalf is there. And George Odom reaches up to bust it up. Third down and nine after all that. I thought D.K. Metcalf might, the ball's under thrown, maybe work back to the ball. He definitely, again, that's a heck of an effort there by Odom to catch up to the ball. But if D.K. Metcalf slows his body down and comes back to the football, he'd be in a much better position to try to fight for the football. Instead, he just kind of waited for the ball to come to him instead of going and getting the ball the way we saw Debo Samuel doing earlier. third down and nine and now finally a timeout is taken by Seattle with them either all of the timeouts on the shelf take one here yeah meanwhile we can tell you families affected by hurricanes Milton and Helene urgently need support you know that help the American Red Cross provide meals shelter these families you can donate today whatever you can hurricane Milton and Helene relief right Third down and nine now at the 49-yard line. Three receivers set to the left. Smith. Throw in. And against the sideline right there. That is Smith and Jigba. Holding it in. D.K. Metcalf clears this out. Opens up a huge hole there on that left side of his defense. Great footwork by Smith and Jigba to get them down. Good throw there. The timing you see to the outside. Watch DK Metcalf just clear out the rookie green. He runs with him. And that opens it up. Nice throw over top a little more for that big game. Confirmed by replay. It was a catch. No challenges in the last few minutes. 34 seconds. Smith throws. That's caught. And gain a 9 there. Fayette, that's going to make it a second and 1 and a timeout. It's always amazing. You see it all. Second and 3. Mason, there he goes again. Up to the 27-yard line behind a block by Aaron Banks. So Mason all ready tonight. 8 carries, 65. And, oh, boy, he is down. And backup would be Patrick Taylor. They've got Isaac Garendo there as well. The Banks goes over to have a look, as does Trent Williams. There is Garendo, rookie out of Louisville, picked him in the fourth round. Taylor is the other back. And this would be serious for the 49ers as he remains on his back after a great jack. He won't even come back. But he does get up and is assisted over to the sideline back after this. He'll go back there. Meanwhile, Garendo will then come in. So Mason now for the moment leading the NFL in rushing. Of course, he's got the one extra half game to this point. To move ahead of Derrick Henry, at least for the moment. Meanwhile, you've got Garendo now, the rookie out of Louisville, in the backfield. It's first and ten from the 27-yard line. Juszczyk is the fullback. And here goes Garendo for a gain of three. Jerome Baker makes the tackle. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Jordan Mason has just gone into the x-ray room here. We're told the issue is his left shoulder, and he's questionable to return. Yeah, we saw him down on the ground for a while. You think about Christian McCaffrey, of course, Elijah Mitchell, down to Jordan Mason. Now he's out here. All that weight comes down on that shoulder. He's in now. Garendo's in. Makes me wonder if Debo Samuel might get even a few more carries tonight running back there. I would bet on him. Take to Garendo. Fired over the middle. out to almost midfield goes Brandon Ayuk who makes his first graph of the night his first target of the night. Talk about the linebackers when you run the football you get that run game going you got to respect it and get downhill and now look at that throwing lane right over top of Dodson. We just talked about the challenge on the eyes and look at the rhythm there of Purdy off that play action. Hitch, ball out, perfectly thrown. there's Samuel lining up adjacent to Purdy use check as well Jennings to the outside take the Samuel side off throw is caught up in the 49 yard line by Kittle tackled there by Witherspoon second and seven yeah the defenders right in his face he just lowers that arm angle goes right around him He would not have had a chance to go over top of him Pretty good job by Witherspoon there who moving around himself tonight because of the injuries that Seattle has with Wolin down Metcalf not a happy camper at the moment. Seven and seven. Not great body language though. No, pretty bad. Samuel in the backfield. He flares out. Birdie's going to run. You know, he doesn't get enough credit for what he does running to the 40-yard line. I'm with you, man. As if it's not hard enough to defend Kyle Shanahan's offense. Now you've got to worry about this. You've got Deebo Samuel. You've got Iyuk. You've got Jennings. You've got Kittle. You've got everybody running around. You've got everybody covered. You've done your job. Great job. Nope. Here comes 13. and take it off. That is a lot to deal with for any defense. And you're right. People do not look at that aspect of his game with his legs. He's a great athlete. Durando back in. Follows Juszczyk. Gain of one. The 49ers have already gained 234 yards in this half. The guy that's playing pretty well for this defense is Mafei, 53. He and Derek Hall, again, both really known as pass rushers. Both were questionable all week. Are they going to be able to play on a short week or not? Both are out there. Hall has five sacks on the year for McDonald, and Mafei has three. Second and nine. Samuel, down the corner he goes, picks up about five there. Trent Williams and Yusek Lee, that's really come alive since early in the game. Right. Decimal meter, which is up on the board here, over 100 again. Second and 18 from the 35. 30 dancing away Chase Sets Fires And it's up at the 38-yard line Jawan Jennings with the Seahawks Will take that That's only a 2-yard gain Where San Francisco sits at the 3rd and 16 I think Kyle Shanahan likes The mobility We got a man Looks like Trey Brown Who's limping off Already some injuries in that secondary Rick Woolen, their starting corner, out for the night. Now their other starter, Trey Brown, out on this big third down. I think he likes some of that, but I think at the same time, he doesn't want him to get always relying upon trying to create too much. Yeah, Nehemiah Christian is a rookie from Auburn. Fifth round pick. After replay assist, the last pass was incomplete. Just wanted the ball to be on the 45-yard line. All right, that's no big deal, really. It makes it third and 18 instead of third and 16. Easy for me to say. Unless you get 17 on the next play. Yeah. Helps with the clock if you're Seattle. Sure. Helps the clock. So you've got a rookie lined up, as you said, Al. He was on the right. He's now moving for now off to the left. To Brock Purdy to the left. Sets up to face Jennings. Meanwhile, here is Samuel still fighting his way. And turns it into a bigger game with a yardage after the catch, but still fourth down and four now for San Francisco. And the rookie, even though he didn't throw it on him, he had to get involved in trying to make that tackle. Debo Samuel is tough to bring down. That was just a quick pass. He's trying to affect field position, if nothing else, there for San Francisco. Penn and Geno Smith back. Mitch Wisnowski second punt. His first was 44. Field it. Nope. Not field it. Let's it bounce. And the 49ers stop it at the 5 yard line. Ronnie Bell is there to cover. On the defensive line averages the fastest getoff at .67. Here he is at .6. So he is fired up tonight going up against Stone. Forsythe throws six pressures. The most he's had in the first half all year. So let's see what he does up at the top there on the edge against this offense. Joey Boza, the brother, no slouch either. Meanwhile, that is pulled in at the 19-yard line by A.J. Barner. On the depth chart, he'd be the number three tight end. A.J. Barner's a good-looking prospect as a rookie out of Michigan. 6'6", 250. They got a good tight end room with Farrah Brown and Noah Phan. First out of it, the 19. Smith, 10 of 19 for a buck 22. And a two-yard gain here for Walker. Tackled by Odom, second and eight. And we're at that point in the game where you don't have to continue to be one-dimensional just throwing the football. But I do think that their best opportunity against his own defense is finding those holes between the backers and the defensive backs and settling in. Lockett has had a very quiet night tonight, always capable of making big plays, 16. Metcalf currently not in the game. Play action. And the action is all in the offensive backfield because the pressure is put on. Pass is out of bounds. Anyway, that time it was Nick Bosa. Who else will come storming in? Yeah, and again, it's just about affecting the quarterback. There's that stance again. Almost looks like he's lined up off sides. He's taking every inch he can there. That was really close, but he goes right around and forces Geno Smith to step up and then out. So, again, impacting the play there. Third and eight. Third down back. Charbonnet is in. They split him wide to the right. So five wide here. Looking that way. Throwing that way. It's there. Lockett. You just talked about it with a quiet night. It's been, but he's been doing these things for 10 years. Tyler Lockett. The reason he saw them spread everybody out. Big play with Kayvon Wallace making the stop there. So on a second and ten, they go 29 yards. And inside Seahawks territory, the ball at the 29-yard line. Just a little hesitation. Corner clears out with Samuel. And nobody picks up the big fella, 85, who just kind of sneaks out down that left sideline. Purdy looks off to safety. Nobody out in that left flat. Big game. Back to the ground. Garendo. Gets away from the first man. Picks a five. Stopped there by Julian Love. Meanwhile, Purdy is now 10 for 16 for 168. Garendo's carried six times for 15. We were talking earlier about how you go back to the Mike Shanahan era and the zone play in Denver and now what we see with Kyle Shanahan, and people are almost like, it doesn't even matter who the running back is. It doesn't even matter who the quarterback is. Yeah, it does. I mean, those coaches find guys who fit their systems, and it all fits together like a puzzle. But you've got to give them credit, both the player and the coach. Time after time, something in that Shanahan family blood. Meanwhile, here goes Garendo. Some tough running. And Garenda will pick up a first down at the 17-yard line. Remember we talked about how this play can go outside or it can come back to the inside. They're going to cut back on the nose guard. So watch the back. He's looking to the left, looking outside, outside, read the double team. That hole is helping him right back this way. So good vision that time instead of bouncing it. Seattle's hustling to get out there, not letting it get outside. He was patient, and then he gets upfield there and read that scene perfectly. Put Patrick Taylor in the game. Put Samuel in motion, a lot of eye candy. And to the 10-yard line goes Patrick Taylor, one of the backup backs out of Memphis, picked him up as a free agent. Had no touches this season until now, mainly a special teams guy. Sure. Kyle Shanahan talked to his team. You know, he told us, we've got to learn through lessons. We've got to learn how to finish. Up 16-3, it'd be easy to say, you know, we've got this game at hand. Uh-uh. He probably told them, guys, we're taking the ball. We're getting the ball to start this second half. We're going right down the field, and we're putting six on the board. Trying to finish it off. They've been limited to one touchdown and three field goals. And this time stuffed after a minimal game is Taylor. Leonard Williams, stuffed to get by number 99. Big third down and three up coming. trying to go back to that zone play, but much better by the defense there. Leonard Williams, such a force on that front. So now, here we go, red zone. Are they going to settle for field goals? Are they going to score touchdowns? The 49ers have run 40 plays and run the ball 24 times tonight. Only 16 pass plays. Third and three. Had a bunch set up to the right. Motion and out. 30. Throws. And right at the pylon. Rulding touchdown. Kittle makes the catch. Right at the pylon. Big spike. And this time the 49ers pay off a long drive. They motioned away and then came back with Jennings to create that confusion with that bunch with three receivers. What a throw. Oh, and how about Kittle? The athletic ability to get both his feet down. Just completely perfect execution. Throw, catch, and the feet for the touchdown in that red zone area. That time they were able to score the touchdown. Feats Julian Love. Here's Wright. He's been perfect tonight. Three field goals, a couple of extra points. And the 49ers in a big game for both teams on top 23-3. Guy likes to have fun and dominate at the same time. Meanwhile, breaking tackles, and he breaks free. Chenault, Chenault, exactly what the Seahawks needed, and Chenault for the touchdown. 97 yards. And if ever you needed a spark, this was the moment for the Seahawks. Down by 20. Chenault, who had fumbled away a kick return earlier, takes it from tight end to the left, the back to the right, is they want to create space and create vertical opportunities. And that's what they have right here. Good matchup. Smart by Geno Smith to throw it there, and he hits a huge one for Seattle. 39 yards, go no huddle here. and the game of about five that time by Charbonnet. Second and five. The offensive line gave him just enough time. He knew exactly where he wanted to go when he spread them out. Meanwhile, Lockett just came out. He comes to the sideline after that play. Second down and six. Again going no huddle. Picking up the pace. Play fake. Pass caught. First down and more to the 25-yard line. Goes Noah. Fan. Quickly to Kaylee. Guys, right now that 49ers secondary does not have the rookie Malik Mustafa in the game. Remember, he jumped out of the gate with that interception on Geno early. But the game is over for him. He injured his ankle late in the second quarter, and he has been ruled out. Oh, boy, that's George Odom who will take his place. Number 30 comes in. Again, minus Traverius Ward to begin with. Fung is on injured reserve, so they are really depleted back there. As Smith sets up the screen after the fake, caught by Walker. Gain of about eight inside the 20-yard line. This is the Seattle offense, I think we expected to see at the beginning of this game. Much quicker, ball out of the hands of Geno Smith. Get the ball out in space, whether it's a back or it's Lockett or it's Jackson Smith and Jigba. Quick throws. Second and two. Walker cannot get around the corner. The tackle was made that time by Brown. Here Brown stopping him. Loss of one, third, and three for Seattle. Nick Sorensen, the new defensive coordinator. It's the fourth defensive coordinator now in five years, right, for Kyle Shanahan. Yeah, as good as their defense is. Yeah. A couple of them ascended to head coaching positions. Robert Stallone at D'Amico Ryans. third and three. And that pass is going to be caught for a first down. D.K. Metcalf covered by Green, the rookie. Boy, this is a great route against press coverage. Watch him give him this inside move like he's going to go to the slant little right there and then back to the outside. Gino locked in on him, saw that matchup against the rookie and took it. Metcalf silences the first quarter. Walker to the three-yard line. They can't get a first down without a touchdown. It'll be second down and two. The left tackle that time, one of the best in the business, Charles Cross pulled around from the outside into the inside. He just got right behind him. That hole opened up. Meanwhile, Lockett has gone back to the locker room with that great catch, staying for one more play. And Walker tries to back his way into the end zone. Stops short, but they pick up a first down. in all likelihood. First and goal. This kid is powerful. Low center of gravity. He'll drive and push. If you think you can just bring him down with one guy, you're not going to be able to. Came close to getting it in. Smith. Can he get in? Tries to burrow his lay in. Lay on pile. I think Fred Warner went over the top and kept him out. Perfectly timed up by 54. Here's Bosa. Meanwhile, sickness on the sideline. Second down and goal here with 150 current drive to 93 yards. The Niners confusion. Yeah, running around. We've got 12 guys out there. Right. Officials had to let them make the substitution. Brown doesn't like it. Enables them to get the right personnel in. Still running around. Still motioning. Meanwhile, Walker goes to the end zone for the touchdown. Kenneth Walker into the end zone. And the Seahawks, who were down by 20, can make it six with the extra point. Go back to the kickoff return. This stadium was flat. The game felt like, well, the Niners did what they needed to do to start the second half. They take the touchdown. The ball, they go down and score a touchdown. They're up convincingly at 16-3 or 20-3. It looks like this game's going to be over. And now they've fought their way back after that return. Now they're believing. By LaVista Chennault. Kick is good. Off the foot of Myers. One hitting the way. That's quite a convoy. Third down. That toss sweep. He used a jet motion going the other way to just kind of affect the eyes of the defense. Try to slow him down, and then you get big Trent Williams out of the corner with Juszczyk. Pretty good job by the defense. Stretch that play out to the sideline. Third and five. A little over five minutes to play in the half. and that's a first time Jawan Jennings making that boy what a difference a year makes last Christmas McDonald comes in defensive coordinator for Baltimore they picked Purdy off four times but a different story tonight so far yeah different personnel different story the timing of that throw on that out cut he doesn't have time to have one more hitch the ball's got to get out it's got to be thrown on a line and look at the accuracy there on that third down throw to Jennings for the first down. 38 out of 12. 142 and a touchdown. Dorindo. The flag at the end of the play. Craig Rolstad will tell us. Personal foul. Face mask. Defense for 55. That is the linebacker Draymond Jones. This deep end right there, right as he was making that initial cut, gets his left hand up in on the face mask and takes him down. Remember, a big thing for San Francisco has been they'll build leads and they don't know how to finish. You know, they get into the red zone and they settle for field goals. Last week they lose the Arizona game in both those areas. Had the lead by 13. Didn't close it off. One of six in the red zone as far as touchdowns. Tonight they're 0 for 1. See if they can finish this drive. Same thing happened against the Rams three weeks ago. And this time stuffed at the line of scrimmage. It's big Leonard Williams stopping Garendo. Second down. A big part of that, and we talked with both Kyle Shanahan and Brock Purdy about that. Brock Purdy put it on himself like any good quarterback would. I've got to be more decisive. I've got to be more aggressive. Kyle Shanahan of course talked about if 23 is back there it's always a different game on how we attack in that red zone area but they're not going to make excuses right? They're going to try to find ways. They're going to run the ball better sustain blocks and they've got to hit those tight windows on their throws with Brock New guy in there Patrick Taylor He's 32 They send him out into the pattern. The pass for Samuel is no good and Artie Burns covers on the plate. Third down and 11 with 3-16 at the halftime. How this game feels. This is a big opportunity for San Francisco obviously and Shanahan. And also a huge, huge defensive stand here for the Seahawks. Get down 20, it's a whole different thing than being down 16. Third and 11. Ushek meant immediately. Big play by Jerome Baker right there to hold him to a field goal attempt. He's manned up there, and he has to beat the guard, Aaron Banks. Watch how he's got to beat this guy right here to be able to get out there. Feels it, sees it, man coverage. He's got to win. Gets right in front of Banks. good job of recognizing that and being able to quickly get into the face of Juszczyk now 35 yard attempt for Matthew Wright who's been good tonight and is good again so he's made three field goals and an extra point so far so good for the guy who tried out with the team on Monday and has given them a 16-0 lead. We'll back and throw him at halftime. There's Wright. So Wright is in Florida. They're living in the Tampa area, and they know that the hurricane is coming in, and they were going to get out of there anyway. And then he gets the call from the 49ers, flies out, wins the audition, and so far so good tonight. It seems like there's a fraternity of guys like that, of kickers. They're not on a roster, and yet they're one call away. If a guy gets into a funk, they get a call. A guy gets injured, they get a call. And he's taken advantage of this opportunity with three field goals tonight. Down here. Big hole. There goes Walker. And he gets taken down before he can pick up the first down. About two yards shy. Kenneth Walker taking it up to the 18-yard line. Third down and two. Finally there. Some room to work. It's been tough for Kenneth Walker this year. And a big hit that time by the rookie Mustafa coming up there, keeping him short of the first down. Yeah, Malik Mustafa already had the pick. There he is again. One of the two rookies in that secondary. Third down and two. Will the 49ers bring pressure here? They don't. Just a four-man rush. And the pass into a lot of traffic is pulled in there by the tight end that's no offense. First down. That's a tough throw against Fred Warner. Not just third down. It's always a tight window. But when you're going up against number 54, who's as good as there is at that second level in the NFL in coverage, he's showing a little bit of pressure and then gets out. He'll move over there just reading Geno's eyes. But a good job of throwing that ball away to that outside shoulder by Geno Smith and away from 54. Extra man comes Take him out of the play Pass to the outside, nothing there Metcalf double covered on the play It'll be second down and ten With two minutes to go in the quarter Running the football, a lot of different formations Just trying to make this San Francisco Defense have to think That time with two tight ends They were showing the way they've been running the ball First and ten, they showed the tendency to be they're going to run the football. They go play action, try to keep the Niners napping a bit, go backside with good tight coverage that time on Metcalf. Then there's Bosa lining up wide. Take him out of the play. Pass is incomplete here. Again, trying to go DK's way. Yadam knocked it down, third and ten. I don't know if he knocked it down or if it just went through his hands. One of the things about him early in his career, used his hands well. Now lately it seems like he uses his body. That was, I think, a ball that maybe, maybe gets touched. But it looks like a ball that hit both his hands. I'm sure he would have loved to have brought that one in. Third and ten. Slid him out to the right. Charbonnet, the third down back in the backfield. along with Fant, the tight end. They both go out in the pattern. The pass is incomplete. A lot of white jerseys around Metcalf, who will draw a crowd in his fourth down. Pretty good job on that right side by Forsyth, giving Geno Smith enough time. Charbonnet there just in case to help out. And I think what the crowd's reacting to is the same thing DK Metcalf. Outcalf reacted to his before he got to the top of the route. There was a little bit of a grab there with that right hand around the hip. Michael Dixon, one of the best in the league. Descended skyward. Jacob Cowling slips at the 15. And then bites his way up to the 23-yard line. A collect call upstairs to say, what the hell's going on down here? From the 24-yard line. 49ers have the ball. Purdy in the pocket. Fires open. Mason. Mason almost gets the first down. He's a yard shy. Second one. Jenkins makes the stop. We go to Kaylee. Well, guys, to paraphrase, DK Metcalf is telling the sidelines he doesn't need any positive words of encouragement. He is over the pep talks. He's just ready to make plays. Well, they went to him three times on that drive. Frustration. second and one Masek was the man in motion and this time Mason gets stopped Darrell Dodson came over from Buffalo stopped him if you watched the Giants last week they ran the ball really really well last week against his defense and talking this week to Mike McDonald who calls the defense as a head coach. It's almost like he took it on himself. Because he takes a lot of pride in being a part of that unit. He said that falls on me. I've got to make sure my guys know the calls and communicate. To the 23 yard line George Kittle playing in line on that one. Making the block to Springham. Second down. We talked about Trent Williams and Aaron Banks. It's really that whole left side. You can never forget about 85 and what he does. what a block just pancakes him sure he has a few words out there on the field George Kittle man kind of a unicorn in this era of tight ends you know there's Kelsey out there who's just such a talented receiver as a tight end but Kittle's an old school guy he's an inline guy that can block like you just saw but also make catches out on the perimeter can't think of anybody who loves to play the game more than Kittle Purdy Escaping again. Backing away. Throwing. Caught to the 10-yard line goes Jawan Jennings, who has emerged this season. Rayshon Jenkins makes the tackle, and that'll spot the ball at the 10-yard line, make it a first and goal on a drive that started back at their own three. What a job here of working with the quarterback. You know, with Purdy and his ability to take off, look how you work back to the middle. Jennings there looking around, head on a swivel, trying to find the linebackers and safeties, He's just kind of sit in that soft spot where Purdy can find him. He's about to give up on the play and then finds 15 for another big game. Boy, what a drive here by the Niners. Well, they've run nine plays, seven rushes. Here's the eighth. Here's Mason to the six-yard line. He goes. Jaron Reed making the tackle. Second and goal with 440 to play in the first quarter. We were talking this week, Al, about what do we think of this game and with all the injuries and who do we think has an advantage. One thing we knew for certain was that the 49ers were going to come in here with some urgency. Losing last week the way they did. A couple tough losses. 0-2 in the division. On the road on a short week. You knew that part of it. And, boy, they have really set the tone here if they can punch this into the end zone. This opening drive. Each team had a gut-wrenching loss in their home buildings last Sunday. Second and goal. Purdy, under pressure, that's incomplete Coverage is good that time Intended formation, Jerome Baker is back there The 7th year linebacker out of Ohio State 3rd down and goal You know, it's really important The 49ers, you're right I mean, they would be 2 games behind Seattle if they lose And by the way, their next game After the mini-bye, a week from Sunday Kansas City 3rd and goal Decibel level In three figures Purdy to the end zone All kinds of action there in contact And drop in the end zone incomplete Debo Samuel is there Artie Burns who was just Activated tonight Artie Burns coming in and they're minus one of their top backs in Rick Wollin, so he is the guy taking his spot, and he makes the big play here. I tell you, that's a heck of a play. Great job of communicating with a corner in Burns who hasn't played a lot of football. That was a good job in that bunch formation. Debo Samuel aligned to the inside, just trying to confuse Seattle, but they were able to pass it off, and Burns was right there in tight coverage. Great job. Needed a kicker when Moody got hurt last week. They had four guys come in, and Matthew Wright, who's been around, typical journeyman, kicker, board, 3.58 to go in the opening quarter in Seattle, and the 49ers draw first blood. And a big score as well, leading them to a victory as Wright's kick this time. Was going to be returnable, and it is returnable now. and to the 10-yard line. It bounced at the 1 into the end zone and went in. Dee Williams, rookie from Tennessee, brings it out. Meanwhile, let's take a look at Bosa. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. If you want to keep an eye on somebody, keep an eye on 97 on third downs. 0.67 is his average takeoff. That's the quickest in the NFL. He gets down in that stance and we already saw it in that opening drive forced that quick pass by Geno Smith that led to that interception in his sixth year out of Ohio State great career, going nowhere you know, Kenneth Walker stopped at the last you think, what is .677? it's two-thirds of a second you know the way people go, a second is one Mississippi so what's that, one Mississippi? one more Yeah, I think he said about all you did. Noah Huddleston. You've got to get off blocks, you know, and so far, doing a good job in the interior. Much better than they did a week ago. Decibel level 101. Take throw, then the pass, and it's broken up. Kittle, the intended receiver, Julian Love, knocked it down. Fourth down, 49ers to kick. Nice job by Julian Love who, when Kittle moved from the right to the left, he was back here and he just kind of walks down. Now he's in position to have to take him to a heck of a battle there. Ball is underthrown, made it easy, but Love, nice job of being in position. Mitch Wisnowski, who had to come in and kick last week, our first flag of the game. How about that? Played 14 minutes and 41 seconds and we hear from Craig Rolstad for the first time tonight Wisnowski last week when Moody got hurt had to come and kick an extra point. But that really factored into the strategy in that game. Not having a guy to kick a field goal. Went for it on fourth and I think it was a 23. Had to. Well you didn't have to but he did. Yeah, right. Wysnowski's boot. Fair catch call for the last second by Dean Williams. And with 12 seconds to go in the quarter, we'll take a 30-second break. Waning seconds of the quarter. Metcalf splits wide left. Move a couple of pieces around. Walker is the running back. And Geno Smith Hands it to him He'll take it to the 31 Fred Warner makes the tackle And that will take us To the second quarter End of the first San Francisco 3 Seattle nothing On Thursday night football downtown Seattle we go to Louisiana next week it will be the Broncos and the Saints on Thursday night football Sean Payton returning to the Big Easy next Thursday night second down and eight as we start the second quarter with a handoff here to the outside turning the corner and picking up about four is Kenneth Walker third down this Seattle offense last week in that Giants game, and it was an unusual game, but the running back position only had seven carries. Five for Kenneth Walker, two for Charbonnet. And here in this first half already, we're seeing a much more determined Ryan Grubb as a play caller getting the ball into these backs' hands. At some point, you've got to feel what a great matchup will be Jackson Smith and Jigba against Lenore in that slot. Third and three. screen set up Walker and it's busted up before it can pick up the first down Fred Warner 7th year BYU a guy has missed only one game playing middle linebacker in 7 seasons watch the instincts he feels his screen right away now he's got to get between those linemen which is exactly what he did and then hit a really talented back and he doesn't let him get that first down What a play. Dixon's second kick toward the sideline. Bounces out of bounds inside the 25-yard line. Great thing about what Mike McDonald is doing, even though he's around the hardballs, he learned a lot from them, but he's keeping his own way of doing it here in Seattle, utilizing the tools that they taught him, but giving it his own personality. birdie dancing wide open making the grab samuel the tackle is missed diebo off to the end zone touchdown 49ers 76 yards got free broke a tackle spun away off he goes to the races Great job here at utilizing both these receivers. Iyuk on the outside takes the corner with him. Safety gets over late. Takes a chance right there by trying to almost mist him when he was trying to go either for the football or trying to hit Debo Samuel. But that is a tough thing to do in open space. But the design of that. And this time he will not come out to it to the light. And tonight, they've got Metcalf involved, but they have not thrown the football at all to Jackson Smith and Jickler or Tyler Lockett. Not yet. And they go nowhere here. 49ers so tough at that line of scrimmage. Mustafa's having a heck of a night already, along with Robert Beal. Loss of three, second and 13, and up they come without a huddle. Robert Beal, good job there. They're going to try to get a little tempo, get the Niners defense a bit on their heels. Now moving guys all over the place here. Smith and Jick would go into the right side in the slot. Smith looking that way. He's going to take off. And Geno slides to a stop with a flag thrown at the 35-yard line. That's the best of their linemen. That's Charles Cross. Ficked in the first round out of Mississippi State in 22. You know, I think they said 67, but the center, Connor Williams, actually was the guilty party. The left tackle was fine on that play, but watch the center. Hunter Williams moved to the inside there, and then he just grabs on to 99 Collins. Right. Yeah, Cross is looking up at the board and going, huh? Right. Charveney. And he takes the ball out to the 33-yard line. It was second and 23. Now it's third down and eight. This defense so far has done a heck of a job. Got a lot of injuries, but they are doing a good job of trying to get this offense into obvious passing situations. Go quickly again. Smith, too high again. And that pass is incomplete. Free play with Bosa moving there. Outside, defense, number 97. The five-run play release. Free play. Third down. Bosa trying to get that big start. We talked about .67, a quickest jump. This is even quicker than that right here. goes before the ball is snapped. So Geno Smith had the free play and just instead of eating it, just throws it high, give his guy a chance and worst case, take the five yards. So it was second and 23, but now it's third and three. Early in the second quarter. Niners realign their secondary as the pass is incomplete. Not even close that time for Smith and Jiglin. So Geno is off the mark. He is four of nine tonight for 53 yards and another punt. And again, it's just the reputation of a guy like Nick Bosa that can affect a quarterback. Watch how he falls off this throw. Kind of falls back as he just didn't get anything into that. I think it affected his accuracy. Dixon's third kick is a beauty. And a fair catch call for the six-yard line by Cowen. 49ers will take over at that spot with 10-16 left in the first half. And Metcalf tonight been targeted four times, only one catch. Ran an easy mesh route underneath against man coverage and he cleared Jackson Smith and Jacob was wide open. And so far, early in the game, but Geno Smith just not. He's kind of a streaky quarterback. There'll be moments where if you can get him off his spot or make him feel that brush, He's just not the same guy, but if he has a clean pocket, he's as efficient as anybody. And right now, Ryan Grubb probably talking to him, trying to find a way to get him into that rhythm. There is Grubb. Changing jobs. Nothing like changing a job when you keep your house. You stay in the same town. Close from the University of Washington to the Seahawks. Drive begins at the six-yard line. Purdy, good protection. Throws caught. Kittle. Game of about five up to the 11-yard line. Dotson making the tackle there. Second down. Question tonight was going to be how would Jerome Baker and Dotson, the middle, that second level of the Seahawks defense, do against Kittle and Samuel. You know how much the 49ers, they like to run the ball, and then they like that play action and those in-breaking routes, those crossers and those digs. At some point, you know that's going to be coming in right behind 0-17 in the middle of that defense. San Francisco. He's made 109 yards in the first half. Hurdy threw for 139. 49ers are going to get the second half kickoff. We go to Kaylee. Mike, your offense had a hard time staying on the field until that last drive. What changed? Well, we've got to stick to the plan. I mean, we had a couple drives where we stalled out there. Keep executing the plan. Make a couple of justice at halftime. We'll be all right. You told us laying the 49ers would be a war of attrition. What's that message at the half? We're 30 minutes in, so we've got a long football game to go. We've got a lot of football to be played, so let's get back to work. Thanks. Back to work they go. Coming up after the break, State Farm Halftime Show. They're still in this game. He had a big time in possession for San Francisco. Had the ball for 18 minutes and 30 seconds as opposed to 11.30 for Seattle. Off we go in the third quarter. Going to run it back from two yards in the end zone. and out to the 22-23 yard line and maybe a little bit more before they blow the whistle. And a flag is thrown here. It's Patrick Taylor on the run back. And we'll hear from Craig Rolstad. Illegal formation. Seattle, number 23. The five-round penalty ended. End of the play. First down. San Francisco. All right, moments to go. Kaylee with Kyle Shanahan. Kyle, your offense moved the ball up and down the field. Controlled time of possession, but you had to settle for those three field goals. How do you turn those into touchdowns? We've got to get in there. I mean, all three downs, you've got three tries to do it. We've got to run the ball better. We've got to get a better deal on third down. All three of them were third and long. All right, so we've got to get a little bit more manageable. We're that close on that screen. The last one was one guy off. Hopefully we keep getting it down there. But speaking of running the ball, we saw Jordan Mason go into the x-ray room. What can we expect from him in the second half? He's good to go. He'll start us off right away here. Indeed he is, and there he is, and he picks up eight yards there. So Mason has now carried nine times for 73 yards. He's averaging eight yards per tote. Boy, it's fun to watch him run that outside zone play. I mean, it's a staple, obviously, with Kyle Shanahan. We've seen it run tonight. We've seen it bounce outside where they're able to set that edge with that double team, and it bounces. We've seen it cut back behind that center block. That's the one thing that Mike McDonald told us to try to defend this thing is the backside has got to really be ready to go. That time they bounced it out wide. You just saw him come off the field after that one play, and Garendo comes in, and he'll pick up the first down up to the 42-yard line. Julian Love comes up to stopping. 49ers pick up the initial first down of the half there is work on that shoulder that's what he injured in the first half and he's such a physical guy it's hard to change his running style he's got to use those big shoulders to run through those linebackers Devo Samuel he goes in motion 30 protected well fires a little bit short a flag is thrown Trey Brown who had a couple penalties last week against the Giants top of the route on Iuke There's no foul to play. Trey Brown stating his case. He felt that you see right there. He's pretty engaged with him. An acquittal. Well, he must be a great great litigator. He made a strong case because, boy, the evidence was stacked against him. No question. He's free. So second down and ten now. Garendo stays in. Birdie, deep drop, sideline open, Kittle down the sideline. He goes bouncing off the Seahawks. And another. Really feel Seattle, too, with a new coach, new regime, new coordinators, especially on the offensive side. I'm looking forward to seeing where they go from here, Making sure they continue to learn. I think this offense has a real chance to be a challenge for anybody they go up against to defend. Smith rolling, throwing, launching. Tipped incomplete with 11 seconds and one kneel down from the 49ers will end this baby. Brock Purdy tonight It's almost like His personality in a way 18-28, 255 3-0 3 touchdowns Oh boy There goes Matthew Wright What was I doing? Getting involved in the tackle Why? Had a great night, other than the Tigers. Right, didn't miss a kick. Three field goals, made every extra point. Niners erased that taste from that bitter loss to Arizona. And a lot of the players in Kyle were saying, you know what, the great thing about playing on a Thursday night is you get rid of that bad taste in three nights. Four nights instead of, you know, a whole week. And now you've got ten days to get ready before you get the Chiefs. Right. The chance to hopefully recover with some of those injuries. Yeah, Kansas City comes to San Diego. The rookie interception. He loved that. Yeah. Nobody can appreciate secondary play more than John Lynch. Nobody. Nobody. So the 49ers roll into Seattle and take care of the Seahawks. They'll meet again later in the year. Key corner on the left to zero, Renardo Green. You got George Odom in there who's a backup safety, 30. Extra man comes. Pass taken in. Enough for a first down. V.K. Metcalf. There he's showing his big physicality. He had some opportunities in the first half, and he wasn't able to use his frame that time. Here at a big moment in this game, he makes a great catch. His third of the night, the 49 yards total. pass taken by Metcalf again this time on the outside yeah holding call there flag here 28 yard line Craig Rolstead letting us know that holding offense number 88 the 10 yard penalty from the spot of the foul replay first down tight end A.J. Barner Barner's just out in front of him trying to make a block we just talked about the rookie he's trying to use the leverage trying to get outside. He does a really good job. Good enough job that Barner loses him. That's rookie on rookie. And he just grabs that jersey because of that effort and the technique there by Renato Green. This way they had a little bit of momentum getting away from their own goal line. They go backwards after that holding call. First and 18. Rush 4 Dancing in the pocket Intercepted Picked off by Green And so the rookie involved in the last play Gets involved in the next play And the rookie out of Florida State With a huge pick But Geno Smith has all the time that he needs Forsyth holds up against literally holds up on the outside against Bosa what a job here by this rookie of stepping in front he's out there on an island against one of the best in the NFL and he shows some moxie here for a young guy steps right in front of that football, Geno Smith he kind of went right and then left came back, thought he could squeeze one in to the big receiver D.K. Metcalf and that's a ball he'd love to have back. So two interceptions tonight by rookies. Green, his first of his career. Mustafa earlier, first of his career. Kittle back out of the locker room and back into the game. Three turnovers to the Hawks. None for the Niners. From the 15 to the outside. Turns it back. Gets inside the 10-yard line. Patrick Taylor. One thing about that route is he started to lose ground. I think Geno Smith expected him to come across the field, and instead he lost ground and got depth, making it easier for Green to be able to step in front of Metcalf. That's what Geno Smith, I think, is frustrated about. He thought he was going to work across and would have kept him in front of Green. So a miscommunication there between the receiver and the quarterback. Second and four. Gain a one, maybe a yard or so. Third down and three. At this point, obviously, not in any hurry. They'd love a touchdown, but a field goal would do the job as well to get them up by a couple possessions. Geno's got to put that one behind him. Still 6.42 to go in this game. and finally a new device to look at the video. Not since Bill Belichick was going to slam down like that. Remember that. Third and four. Birdie. Shoulder shake. Throws into traffic. Kittle. Touchdown. His second. so Kittle went back to the locker room comes back now he's going to celebrate they're both going to jump in that's both their wives how crazy is that they knew exactly if we score we're coming up into the stands tonight double dating they get both the backs the fullback and the running back clear out it takes two defenders with them And now it's just one-on-one in the middle. Great job. That's a matchup. You're going to win every time with Kittle there. Jenkins is a great player. But the timing with Purdy looks it off, opens up the middle, and it makes a good throw on time. Going for two to try to make it a 14-point. We told you don't touch that dial. That's right. Right? That's right. Or whenever you're streaming the coach on a graphic to promote a game. I'll say, yeah. That'll be quite a story next week. Yep, for sure. we're resounding acknowledgement from the crowd as he goes Samuel takes it from inside the five and gets spilled up at the 27 yard line time now for tonight's journey presented by Hyundai he was Samuel three receptions and 14 rush charges from run that kickback Kittle has a TD. Great catch right there, right at the pylon. Hawks, touchdowns on their last two possessions when they were down 23-3, now 27-17. Get ready for those decibels to crank up here. This crowd is excited after 14 unanswered. 26-yard line, fake to Taylor. Rolling, throwing, no good. Incomplete. Kaylee. Guys, Kyle Shanahan told me that he was going to put Jordan Mason back to work after that left shoulder injury, but this makes a second drive where he's not on the field. He's right in front of me with a new heavy supportive tape job on his shoulder, and he's doing everything he can to keep it loose on the sidelines, but not on the field. Yeah, there's Kaylee right on the action. Bird's eye view of that. He was in for one play, started the second half, gained eight yards, and then came right out. 7-10. Artie Burns just jogged off the field, injured, so the rookie off to the left is Pritchett. That's Chris Conley in motion. Purdy thought about running, throws. Jusek makes the catch, but he is smothered by Baker at the line of scrimmage. It'll be 3rd and 10. Amazing what momentum can do for a defense. You know, this crowd comes alive. This defense has been struggling at the line of scrimmage and struggling against his scheme. All of a sudden, he's got a little bit more juice to him, a little bit more effort. Chance to get off the field again. Third and ten. Bernie hit as he throws. That's caught at the 30, but shy of the first down. Love makes the tackle there on Jawan Jennings. Fourth down, and the Niners to punt again. Oh, my gosh. This is a huge play, and you're out in space. Julian Love, can you make this tackle right here? You got to come up. There's nobody else out there. It's one-on-one. Can you get your defense off the field? He does it. What a play. Well, the end of three Are we due for a fabulous sport? Let's find out End of three 49ers 23 Seahawks 17 To take the lead with a touchdown here We'll see how this drive commences After the punt A fair cash is called for There's all kinds of contact There's a flag there Dee Williams had called for the fair cash Who did what? Chris Conley ran into him Witherspoon looks like he may have pushed him in to the returner. Probably picked that flag up. Yeah, that's the discussion right here. So if they pick it up, Conley, wait a second. He pushed me into him. I didn't do anything. Nothing. San Francisco player who hit the Seahawks receiver was blocked into him. Therefore, there's no foul. It'll be first out of ten, Seattle. So, you know, it's hard to get the demons out of your head. The 49ers have blown two double-digit leads this season to the Rams in Arizona. And here they are again on the verge. Yeah, and that's all we heard about all week was what we've learned from those mistakes. We learned we've got to finish, you know, things of that nature. And up 20 after that kickoff return by Chennault, it's just been a different energy and a different kind of game. And also, Geno Smith, like we said, he's a streaky quarterback. Five of six for 78 yards on that last drive. He's gotten into that zone we kept waiting for him to get into. The part I'll say before we get started here is the Kyle Shanahan factor. Conventional wisdom says three runs make Seattle use their three timeouts. But with Kyle Shanahan, the way he coaches, sometimes one step ahead of you, wouldn't surprise me at some point before third down, maybe a play action, high percentage throw, just to try to get them out of position. That wouldn't shock me. Aggressiveness is in his DNA. Dorendo is the running back. Start on the ground. And Dorendo out in front, down the sideline, being chased. One man to beat, and that man stops him, but at the four-yard line. So of all crazy things, a 76-yard run, and now Seattle takes a timeout. Again, this outside zone, you think it's going to bounce, but here's a great example where it's taken away. These linebackers take themselves out of position. Everybody's worried about getting to the outside. Watch the block right here by the center. Turns his backside and opens that hole for the back. So it's a stretch play. Look at a beautiful view of it right there. The right guard, the rookie, Pooney, does a nice job at pushing and opening that hole up. And then how about the smart play here? I think he does. I think he takes a dive there to just keep working that clock. Garendo with that 4-3-3 speed he exhibited at the combine. Rookie, Louisville. The 49ers tonight have rushed for 224 yards. How about Shanahan right there? Right. When they know you're going to run and you open that up. Forcing them to use them to time out. So you lose Jordan Mason for most of the game. Good first half got hurt. One carry in the second half. Using Taylor a lot. There is Mason. Taylor's been doing the bulk of the ball carrying. Put Garendo in at the end, and it just about seals the deal. It's amazing. A big conversation with Kyle Shanahan's team. When's Christian McCaffrey going to be able to come back? He's one of the best players in the whole league, obviously, and they've been doing the best without him with Jordan Mason. You don't have Elijah Mitchell, so Mason's technically really your third guy. And then you've got Garendo who gets a chance. He's your fourth guy. Patrick Taylor comes in. He's your fifth guy. All these guys are carrying the football with McCaffrey and Mitchell down and now Mason down. Talk about depth of the backfield. Want to get to McCaffrey in a second here. Second down and goal. Oh, he's going to go quiet. Well, that'll seal the door. Where is she? Where is she? One more time. Ha, ha. And this time Samuel joins the party. Kittle as well. One more time. That's too good. He was more focused on going up into the box and scoring. Boy, how about that, by the way? That thing opened up. What a job by this offense with a game on the line. Everybody in the world knows you're going to run. They have the big run by Garendo, and then the old-school fullback dive there. How fitting of a way for this 49ers team that had to go on the road after a short week, after a disappointing loss to the Cardinals. What a great way for them to finish this one off and get a W. Right. Extra point is good. He's had a perfect night in his 49er debut. View check right there. 36-24. Well, they rehearsed it earlier. And then the replay. That's good. So each team comes off a gut-wrenching loss. Giants knocking off Seattle. Arizona knocking off San Francisco. In a game that was really an early season vital game for the 49ers. They're going to come out of here with a huge win to get back to 3-3. Drop Seattle. A team that started with three straight wins to 3-3. Arizona. Yeah. I mean, who knows? Yeah. Who knows? They've got a different feel, don't they? Definitely. Seattle will go to Atlanta next week. And then Buffalo comes here and the Rams come here. Two home games after that. And Wright, who's won a job for probably at least a month until the kicker. 51 seconds. Thank you. Terry McCauley, this is as close as it gets. What did you see? Yeah, Al, we've seen two different angles where it's pretty clear it hits the finger of the receiving team player. And then there's a clear recovery by San Francisco. I believe this should have been reversed to San Francisco's football. But it was not. There's so much going on there. You've got a guy blocked into the returner, but it's up to the returner to protect himself. It's a live ball if it, in fact, hits the return man. It looks pretty clear that it hit his thumb. And then it's down to, is there a quick recovery? And, yeah, there it is right there by Grant. Seattle catches a break. Major. Second and six. Set of the 49er ball inside the 20. Draw play. Charbonnet moves to the outside. Finds room. Picks up the first down. This kid, of course, most of the carries go to Kenneth Walker. But on a quiet week last week against the Giants, they leaned on both of these backs in the run game. And what a physical run that time by Charbonnet. Very different running style. Not nearly as quick as Kenneth Walker, but you can see the strength that he has to be able to break through some tackles there. At the 30. Smith. Everybody covered. Flag is thrown. Fant nearest to it. Nick Bosa, who else, forced the issue. This is great because not only has he... Yeah, forced issue of the receiver. Yeah, yeah. It's great. This guy like a linebacker as far as his intelligence playing defensive end I feel like what most people recognize with him is just how quick he is and what a great pass rusher he is An eligible man downfield Offense, number 67. That penalty's declined. Rolled through the plays. The incomplete pass. Second down. And again, that's all Bosa. Those linemen are downfield because it's a screen. And the guy who saw that it was a screen first to the tight end right across from him, 87, is 97. He sends a screen right away, so he doesn't even rush the quarterback. They're thinking he's going to come to me. Of all people, Bosa with that .67 getoff is going to come to me as a quarterback. Instead, he senses that and gets the penalty and takes away the throwing receiver. Perfect on his part. Second and 10. Nothing doing there. It'll be third and 10. Charbonnet. Gains nary a yard. A little over 13 to play in regulation. Six-point game. No huddle here. The way Bosa's playing right now, you better have Charbonnet over here to the right chipping and helping out with Forsythe. Bosa gets there, but Smith escapes and then just throws it away. I was surprised that Charbonnet leaked out of the backfield and kept Forsythe on an island he was trying to just take and forget the sack he just wanted to rip the ball away from Geno Smith this poor right tackle again he's doing a good job trying hard but that is a tough oh the ball almost came out he went for the ball he got his hands on the ball Forsythe by the way the right tackle the third right tackle for this offense and Bosa making all three plays on that series. Dixon's fourth punt of the night. Another beauty. At the 11-yard line, slipping, falling, and getting tackled there was Jacob Cowling. Dee Williams on top. Your time of year? No, sir. No, me either. I like comedies. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's smile. Romantic comedies. There you go. Who likes to be scared? We like dramatic games. We had one last week, got one tonight. Tebow Samuel is the running back in this set from the 12-yard line. With 12-and-a-half to play in regulation. Oh, confusion there. There's your flag. No question about that. Not very often do you see two guys in motion almost running into each other. Rare miscue by Kyle Shanahan offense. Number 82 and 85, both moving. Two tight ends moving at the same time. Advantage. Birdie throws. Flag is thrown. Both of Kittle's touchdowns tonight have come on third down plays. Offside. Defense number 28 lined up in the neutral zone. Ball we placed at the one yard line and we will retry. It's on the rookie, Pritchett. Kittle now with two TDs tonight and five for the season. And there's the rookie green. What a time to have that interception. From the one for two. And stuck. No. Kobe Bryant takes care of Patrick Taylor. 6.20 left in the fourth. In Seattle where the 49ers are up by a dozen. There they are looking for their wives. Mrs. Kittle, Mrs. Juszczyk. What do we call that? The loom and leap? I love the punch there by Kittle's wife. And then they go and watch it on their phone. Kittle forgot he had to be reminded there by Ushchad. Yes. He would have been in the doghouse. San Fran by 12. Five-yard line fielded. Williams. tripped up at the 30-yard line. Now I know you love to see the next-gen stats. They're powered by AWS. It's been Bosa and Forsyth on that right side. Eight pressures on 19 matchups by Nick Bosa. Does not include what he's done in the run game. He has been a horse tonight. You know, and as a leader, he and Fred Warner, this team, after a loss last week to Arizona, he knew on a short week he's going to have to step up, and he certainly has done that. No doubt. As the Seahawks take the ball to 30-yard line. Down by two possessions. Swing it out here. Walker. Next to nothing. Second down. Seattle minus three in turnovers tonight. The result of that has been 12 points for San Francisco. It's a difference in this football game. They came in and the night, or just coming into this football game, minus three on the year, and then to play a good team like Kyle Shanahan brings in here to be minus three at home, you're not going to win a football game. That's tough to overcome. Second and nine. Smith fires. Caught. And enough for a first down there. Noah Fant, the tight end after the 43-yard line. With Sam Prince sitting back, Geno Smith's got to not only complete passes, Sam Prince is going to keep everything in front of him. Got to have a sense of urgency here with 5.15 to go in his football game, a two-possession game. Smith under pressure. Gets away. Going along the sideline there. Smith and Jigba making the grab. Short game. five yards second down and five taken down to the five minute mark left in regulation amazing the job this secondary has done depleted a lot of their playmakers a lot of their leadership taken down because of these injuries and some of these guys that have not played a lot of football have stepped up we just saw Green with that big pick go five wide here Shuno throws low that was Bosa again putting the heat on How about this? Instead of on the right, he lines up on the backside. Blindside of Geno Smith against a good against good. Cross that left tackle who's got great length, great hands, but has not had to deal with 97 tonight. He's had to deal with Leonard Floyd. Bosa matched up there again on that side. Third down five. Flag. Going deep. Matt Calf will take it to the end zone. What about the flag back at the line of scrimmage? Illegal shift is going to be the call against Seattle, negating what you just saw. Illegal shift. Time to throw when it's been an obvious situation. and he got inside the safety there, and he's known for his hands. That would have been a spectacular catch. That ball had some zip on it, and at the last second he tries to go and use his body control to try to bring that down, and the ball just gets away from him. Coming up right after the game, per usual, J.C. Penney post-game show exclusively on Prime Video. Plenty to talk about tonight and a big game in the NFC West. Think about the Metcalf touchdown where they had the illegal shifts. They would have scored, and they would have had plenty of time to be able to try to get Sam Fran's offense off the field. And then when he scrambled to his right, Kenneth Walker slips down that right sideline. Nobody goes with him. And, you know, you can't see everything. But Geno Smith, you thought with his vision of the field, he might have seen that, but he missed that one. So those were two touchdown opportunities, which not only put six points on the board, but also, more importantly, saves the clock and gives you a chance. Now they've got to score fast. Fast, and of course then you're thinking about an onside kick. The back is Charbonnet. And that is out of the end zone, Smith and Jigba. No chance. So third down and goal. Smith now who started very slowly is from for 280 yards, 27 out of 43. You know what's interesting in this game with all the pressure put on the quarterbacks, especially Smith? No sacks. None. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Not one? I just looked at that and said, what? It feels like there's been a few because of all the pressure. Right. Third and goal. Especially right there. That could have been again, but again, pressure was on, forcing Schmidt to throw off his backflip. Tending for Metcalf, fourth out. There's some confusion there. The offensive line didn't move. The ball was snapped. The left side of the offensive line, they didn't move. I thought maybe there was going to be a potential flag, but watch the left side of the line. And that's, watch this ball snapped. Now it's to your right. No one moves. Looks like only Conor Williams knew what this thing was. So meanwhile, fourth and goal. Almost a last gasp here for the Seahawks. Can they get it in? Smith, under pressure, throws it. Can! Lockett, touchdown. Tyler Lockett. some huge plays tonight. They put him in a bunch formation. He's going to attack and then come back to the football. Good job there at the top of that route. He knew exactly where he was, about two or three yards into the end zone, which allowed him to come back to the football. And Bosa, like you said, no sacks. He's been so close. And Geno Smith felled him, got the ball out on time, and they get the touchdown. Yeah. Myers. That makes it a five-point game. 29-24. Most important. All three timeouts. And now, you know, you're Seattle. It used to be, I mean, the onside kick, you have to declare it now. You've got to go for it. I mean, the other option, obviously, is to kick off, take the timeouts. Yeah. I just hope you can hold it. Right. Right. I think with all three timeouts, I would consider just kicking it deep and relying on three straight runs and the defense getting three straight stops, using all three timeouts, get the ball back to Geno Smith, maybe with about a minute, minute ten to go. And you've got a veteran quarterback with a really good group of receivers, with a banged-up secondary. But you've got to get the three stops. I mean, that's what you're Mike McDonald, you're a head coach, you're a defensive-minded coach. You've got to trust your defense to do that. You've got to get the stops, and you've got to get a touchdown. A field goal is no good here. So Myers, he'll opt for the conventional kick here. Well, conventional as of this year, anyway. Bouncing ball. Bounced at the 10. And out to the 20. They're going to stuff him short of there. Patrick Taylor. So now it's up to the D. With only his second catch of the night. And Samuel trots back in. Anytime you split your safeties like this, there's the opening for the San Francisco offense. That's where they're looking to try to attack. That ball is anticipated. It's out early. He throws Iyuk right into that hole. And again, the timing and the rhythm there. Ball out on time. Great catch. Great throw. Samuel gets right back into the action. Gets a yard to the 40-yard line. Kaylee, what you got? The whole second half has been a struggle for the 49ers left guard Aaron Banks, guys. He got an IV in the locker room during the third quarter because he started cramping. And now I'm told those cramps are acting up again. That's what's got him on his back with his left leg in the air as the trainer works the Theragon on his left hamstring. Yeah, there he is, Spencer Burford. Takes his place for the moment. Only good news for the Niners. You have the mini bye week after a Thursday night game. Put their next game in ten days against the Chiefs. Second and nine. 30. Backside incomplete. He's going to be gone anywhere anyway with Jones covering Juszczyk on the play, third and nine. This is what Mike McDaniel wanted all night. Gino Smith just hoping to get his hands on the ball. Mike McDonald felt that, hey, listen, we've got to play on our terms at critical moments. We've got to get him to obvious passing situations. If Kyle Shanahan's dictating things and throwing on their terms, it's going to be a long night. Here's one of the most critical moments in a game at third and nine, 9.38 to go, down six. chance to get Purdy off his spot and get pressure on him. Yeah, you saw McDonald. He was frantic. He wanted to get Dotson back in the game. Zero. Kittles back in the game. Third and nine. And now a timeout is taken by San Francisco. A lot going on. Timeout. Remember, they lost that challenge, so they only have one remaining. Again, the importance of this game I mean, for Seattle to win it, take a two-game lead for San Francisco to lose it, of course you talk about an early season hole but they're used to it. Remember a couple of years ago they started out same thing. Twice. Got to the NFC championship. Yeah, right. 21 and 22 If I ask you who the best team in the NFC is, like, not right now, but when you look at the roster and you look at their potential I still think San Francisco, especially if they get Chris McCaffrey back. Who else besides them? I mean, you bring up Dallas, you bring up Green Bay, Tampa, and there's some good teams out there, but if San Francisco's healthy, they're still a force in this NFC. Agreed. Third and nine. 30 fires, high, incomplete. Jennings, the intended receiver. Good coverage. And they're mixing and matching in the secondary. Guys coming in and out. Rookies all over the place. Fourth down. No doubt about that. This time they showed a little bit of pressure and then dropped back and played zone. Really good job of communicating. Everybody being on the same page. You got a young guy like Kobe Bryant out there. Like I said, you get him to third and nine. Mike McDonald felt pretty good about getting him off the field. Wisnowski. He'll try to deaden it before it goes into the end zone. And it bounces it to one and takes a perfect San Francisco bounce. And Conley is there to down it. Which, that's one. Yeah, Al, I spoke with Walt Anderson in the command center in New York. And what they're telling me, they did not get our enhanced video that we showed the ball touching the finger. What they had was the raw feed from our cameras. And it was not clear and obvious to them that it touched the finger. Obviously a gigantic play in this game. Meanwhile, Seattle is now backed up at their own three-yard line to begin this drive. And out of the end zone, the pass goes to Walker. And he gets taken down there by Odom, a little bit shy of the 10-yard line. Yeah. There's George Kittle now going in. Quickly. Yeah. Quickly in and back out and back out on the field for San Francisco. when Seattle's played at their best it's been just quick decisive throws spreading out the defense second and four passes caught lock it that big play earlier on that touchdown drop picks up a first down here on his only second catch of the night you got some inexperience you got a rook Seattle number 9 and number 19 You heard him say that Kenneth Walker, who went out in motion because of the movement by Lockett, he never stops. He never gets set. So here's Lockett. Here's Walker right here. When he goes out, out to the left, he just kind of keeps moving, keeps moving, keeps moving. He needs to come set, and he never does. so an irrelevant penalty cost the Seahawks a huge touchdown. So third and ten after the flag. That's caught just about at the first down mark. Fighting for it to make sure he gets it is Jake Bobo, number 19. But Jake Bobo with 6'4", fighting for that first down. Hasn't touched the ball tonight. It's involved in special teams, but a great effort there to get that first down. Smith. Outside. Caught. Goes right back to Bobo. Two in a row. Second down. Second and three. Gain a seven. Metcalf checks back into the game. That ball. That touchdown was perfectly thrown. Metcalf got underneath it. Five wide here. Bosa trying to come to Smith's left pass. It's caught. Ball is out. But Seattle will recover it. Anthony Bradford is there after Jackson Smith and Jigba. You know who knocked that ball loose? I think it was Fred Warner, who, of course, his legendary status is a guy who likes to rip the ball out. There it is. He told us he likes to come from the top down. He punched that one out. Third and two. This will be for the snap. False start. Offense. Number 67. Five-yard penalty. Still third down. For Warner, that was four forced fumbles this season. Yeah, four. Like I said, I mean, as good as he is at every other aspect, I mean, this is probably the thing that announcers talk about the most because he just does it. on such a regular basis. Just has a knack for it. You said, do you plan it? And he just said, you know, it's just kind of a feel. Sometimes you just feel it. That one was perfect to knock that one loose. Knows the angle. Third and seven. Smith throws. That's caught. Walker. And he fights for the first down. Before he gets gang tackled. Three and a half to play. Looking ahead. Seattle's got all of its timeouts. And the two-minute warning. Yeah, trying to get this score in before needing to use that two-minute warning or a timeout. Trying to hold on to these timeouts for their defense. Geno, on the move, fires, that's caught, 20-yard line. Lockett makes that grab. Oh, he missed one there. He had Kenneth Walker down the right sideline, and nobody took him. When he went into scramble mode, nobody took Kenneth Walker down that right sideline. And Yadam, I think, gets his eyes in the backfield 22. Watch, he kind of, he just, there's no one there. And he was right in the direction that he was rolling that way when he got out of the pocket. Just didn't see him. From the 19, first down. That's caught. Walker tackled after a very short game. Under three to play right now. Yeah, they got to hurry here. Like I said, a sense of urgency trying to hold those timeouts. as best they can. It's all about scoring before that two-minute warning to help their defense out. Second and eight. Smith. Caught underneath. Walker. Trying to get outside. Can't. Gets to the first down mark. Stays inbounds. Clock keeps rolling. Everybody's tired out on that field right now. The linemen are tired. The defense is tired. 14 seconds to go to the two minute warning. Smith trying to get one more play off. First and goal. From the nine. Smith. Well protected. Fires. Can't make the grab. Lockett reaching for it. Stretching. 159 and there is your two minute warning. So down the stretch will come. They've got three timeouts. Down by 12. Give this offensive line a lot of credit because Smith, for the most part, has had some. I'm going to guess that Kittle is probably right. All due respect to Sauber. Back to the 7th person. Technically, if you go back to where that fumble occurred on that punt return, and basically cost him 70 yards of field position. Exactly. 30. Pump fake. Out of the end zone. Throws. Used check. The Harvarti in up to the 20-yard line. Two things there. Number one, look where he's backed up. I mean, he's standing on his own goal line here. So the poise and the offensive line. Only rushing four, but still. I thought he was just going to abort, throw it away. Last second, he finds Juszczyk on that check down. Now they've got a real shot here. Second and two. Mason's still trying to work that shoulder loose on the sideline. Up the middle goes Taylor to the 23-yard line. They found another back here. I mean, they put Garendo in there for a while, and that table seems to, not seems to, is doing the bulk of the ball carrying. Essentially, their fifth back, if you include Elijah Mitchell and, of course, Christian McCaffrey. We've got a man down to left guard, Aaron Banks. Unsung guy. He's having a heck of a year, though. He is. They love him up front. Yeah, next to Trent Williams. I mean, just the injuries. I mean, it's all over the league this time of the year. but these two teams, even tonight, added on to the injury list. Take a break here. We'll go to the bench at least for a couple of plays. Spencer Burford takes his place. And the ball is at the 23-yard line. First down. 49ers, 11-17 left in the fourth. Samuel is the back. Toss to him. And they're going to blow that play dead before the snap. Yeah, movement on the right side of that offensive line. Seattle was dialing it up. They've not been blitzing a ton that time. They walked eight or nine guys up tight. Now there's Samuel. Look at him. as they say battle of attrition it certainly is every time these teams meet hell it's the same in every game in the NFL yep so Samuel will work his way over to the sideline he's out there are two fouls on the play false start offense number 66 How about getting a face mask on what's really a dead play? It was on Samuel as he's running the football. Leonard Williams just hustling, trying to make a play. The whistle comes in, and there he is grabbing a hold of the face mask. So that was going to be a five-yard penalty that was going to cost the Niners going backwards. and now 15 yards on top of that. And no player than Samuel gets hurt. Somewhere in there. So Banks is out. Kittle for the moment is on the sideline. There's Samuel looking none the worse for her, at least for the moment. And again, that's where you risk putting him in there as a ball carrier. You know, he's one of your better receivers, but because of the injuries and because he's just so darn good, you want the ball in his hands. That happened right at the beginning of that play where he just ran into, looked like Draymond Jones, 55, hit him at the beginning and hit him right on that hand. But instead of first and 15, they obviously did positive yards. So he looks like he's ready to come back in. that's to stay out for at least to play you want sober comes in and tie then and place a kid only got Taylor in there is the running back first down fires talk that's I you to the 41 yard line Brandon IU comes back as D Williams He's going to run this baby back. Oh, no, another kicker had to make a tackle. Oh, boy, yeah. Oh, he's not out. Oh, look at this. He got pounded there. Oh, he felt that. He was on a couch last week, and now he just got run over. Probably thinks I should be on that couch. I'm telling you, he threw everything he had into that. Yeah, we were talking to Kyle last week about, you know, don't you tell your kicker? He said, yeah, I know it. I don't know what to do because he's gotten burned by eight. Here he is going. Oh, man. Smith. Dancing in the pocket. Throws. Incomplete. Smith and Jig with the intended receiver. Second down and ten. Meanwhile, just to finish up on McCaffrey. He's got tendonitis in both Achilles left and right. Remember last year he was on the injury report week 17 calf injury. I'm not playing doctor here, but the calf and the Achilles, you can figure that baby out. Meanwhile, there's no real timeline scheduled to bring him back. Talking to John Lynch, there's John, GM, Kyle Shanahan. They hope, hope, hope, maybe three or four weeks, they hope. We'll see. That thing flares up, though. That's the issue. That's the fear, though, right? Right. I mean, with an injury like that, nobody knows his body better than Christian McCaffrey, the way he takes care of that year-round. So he'll come back when he's ready, and hopefully it'll be this year, and hopefully it'll be during an opportunity for this team to make a stretch run. You just know when the dust settles in the NFC, Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers are still going to be a team you're going to have to deal with, despite all the injuries. And now we're speaking of injuries. We might be dealing with a shoulder there with a kicker. Oh, boy. Well, he's got 10 days to recover, whatever it is. That is almost picked off and incomplete here. Fred Warford was all the way back there. You know, we saw John Lynch. I mean, what a career this guy had. Tremendous player, Hall of Fame. Went into broadcasting. I think he was great. Had a chance to come back to San Francisco, take this job with Kyle. They came in eight years. Well, they've only been to four of the last five NFC Championship games. What a marriage, you know, with ownership, GM, head coach. I mean, talk about consistency. I feel like the Chiefs and the 49ers really are the two teams, whether you win the Super Bowl or not, just as far as putting the same kind of product out year after year. and Fant makes that catch gets out of bounds so the Niners a regal franchise I mean great in the 80s and 90s Bill Walsh of course so much a part of that George Sheffert takes over so good of late all those three agents and the late picks lost the ball there and Flex Flex stops the play it's funny you think about it we were talking about it at the meeting earlier today as Rolstead will make this call. Ball start. Offense. Number 19. Five run penalty. Go first down. When you think about the 49ers, five Super Bowl wins, but none in 30 years. It feels like... I was shocked when you said that. I just feel like they're hovering around every year. And they are. Yeah. Haven't been able to seal the deal since the 94 season. Meanwhile, finally a sack. First of the game. And that's the final timeout. I think it's worth saying because I know all week people talked about, boy, this team, they've got to learn how to finish. Their own fan base, some of their own media was frustrated with the way they played last week and the way they played against the Rams. And tonight they were tested. You know, they had a 20-point lead, and here came Seattle back after the kickoff return, a chance to maybe get back in and maybe even take the lead. The missed call on that muff punt didn't allow that to affect them. The crowd going wild. They blew the two big leads that they had. But despite all the injuries, despite all the adversity, they found a way on the road to win in, obviously, a tough environment in a divisional game. Media frustrated? Come on, stop the presses. Second and 23. Caught. Trying to get out now. Out of bounds and he can't. Clock keeps rolling. Third down and long. Green makes the tackle on Fant. Third and eight. Down to 20 seconds. Smith's going to spike it. Stopping the clock. It'll be fourth down. Oh.
