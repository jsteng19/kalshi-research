 Which is kind of on the ropes here in the early going. High expectations with the signings of the quarterbacks. See who can try to settle in here, make some adjustments. Week 5. Everybody trying to find that same formula that Tampa used when they brought Brady in and the Rams used when they brought Stafford in. And both won the Super Bowl. And off we go from the Mile High City with, it figures, a touchback. Matt Ryan. in 2022 this season his numbers right there five touchdowns five interceptions he's been sacked 15 times and he has lost three fumbles he's fumbled nine total times and he's way well on his way to what would be a league record but i don't think he's going to get there i don't think he will i think that's just trying to make things happen with this offense it's still not been able to run the football as well as they had hoped. Starting the gun. Hines is the running back. And off we go with a pass to Hines who drops it to a very inglorious and ill-aspicious start where the Colts to use Hines basically Kirk was talking about at the top as the receiving back on third down, but tonight he's going to be a key man. Yeah, I mean that's his bread and butter right there. He gets out into the flat, catches the ball, and I'm sure he's anxious. A big opportunity for him to be the showcase back with Jonathan Taylor out. Hines only had 56 carries a year ago. He's known usually they put him out the slot or they use him as a receiver. Crowd already roaring. They give it to Hines. He looks for space. Finds a little bit. Gets up to the 28-yard line. Kareem Jackson making the tackle. That offensive line which has had its issues. Yeah, they have reshuffled the tech here. You know, this is a line that they thought they felt pretty good about, but the right side with some injuries has put them in a tough spot. So you take the left tackle, Matt Pryor, you move him over to a right tackle, his more natural position. Braden Smith, who was the right tackle, he's now the right guard. And a position he played in college, he's a three-year starter at Auburn, at right guard. So they're just trying to kind of find their best five in the best five spots. third and seven Ryan hangs in the pocket throws and has to move up toward the line of scrimmage the catch is made but they don't get a first down Hines about a yard and a half short and once again Indianapolis cannot score off its first drive they haven't scored a single point of a first drive this season and meanwhile of all things oh boy well we've seen stumbling and And you know what I'm talking about. Hines needs some help to just remain upright. Yeah, he got hit after this catch, just trying to make something happen. I think he got hit from behind right there was the contact that knocked him down. And I can see the reaction that he had after that hit. Sure did. Right, and there it is. Oh, man. I hate to see it. Don't need any more of this. So they will walk him to the bench and check him out thoroughly. And it's fourth down and two. And once again, it's a three and out on Indy's first drive. And they'll punt a minute and three seconds into the game. So you're going to see a lot of Phillip Lindsey now. Yeah. Even more than you thought. and Deion Jackson is the other running back seldomly used to this point. I think everybody's just happy to see after the way he looked after he got up. It's good to see Hines walking off the field. There's a look at Phillip Lindsey. We'll tell his story more. He's going to get a big opportunity now tonight. Matt Hawk to do the punting. Montrell Washington, good-looking rookie returner from Samford. Let's that bounce, and it takes a good Denver bounce and bounces all the way back to the 35-yard line. Russell Wilson. Ten years in Seattle with a ton of success. Went to two Super Bowls, won one, lost one. Four TDs, one pick. Pass rating a little below the league average right now. Like Ryan, he's been sacked a lot, but that's been the case throughout his career. Twelve sacks this season. Yeah, and I think it's one thing to remember. You've got a new head coach who's a play caller, so you've got a new play caller. You got a quarterback who's an incredible career, but he's learning a new system. He's learning new receivers. He's looking at Hines headed to the locker room. So this offense is clearly still a work in progress. Start with Gordon. Secures the ball with both hands. Picks up three to the 39. Kaylee was talking about how he was most delay of game penalties early on. False starts the whole thing, and they have the most penalties in the league. sidearm and that's incomplete trying to get that one to Eric Saubert got a touchdown in week two third and ten this offense is very much like Indianapolis it's very easy to point the finger at the play caller, the head coach or point it at the quarterback this is a collective effort everybody is still trying to understand where they're going to go eight weeks from now five weeks from now, it's going to be a different offense. And they're right in the process of developing who they're going to become and creating that identity. There's growing pains along the way in creating that chemistry and rhythm. They hope in a few weeks. Third and ten. Wilson on the pressure, and down he goes. The off sack, Russell Wilson. Yannick Ngakwe picked up as a free agent from the Raiders, and it's a very quick three and out. See, I think this is the difference with the Colts right now, is the way they can pressure now. And Ngankwe has a different kind of twitch and a different kind of quickness off the edge. And I think it's really helped Quiddy pay on the other side. So they're pressuring quarterbacks much better. They actually brought pressure from the second level, but at the end they didn't need it. Corliss Waitman's punt. Isaiah Rogers is back. Collects it at the 41-yard. The old stadium was adjacent to this one. Old Mile High Stadium. It was a relic, but it was beautiful. Deion Jackson is the running back from the 40. Play action, good protection, and that time it's a drop at the 45-yard line. Caden Stearns broke it up. Michael Pittman, Jr., their top receiver, could not hold on second and 10. Yeah, and Caden Stearns is kind of disguising his coverage. walked up tight and sinks in coverage and allows him to come up with some speed to separate the football from Michael Pittman. I love the call. Early down, you're not able to establish the run. This is a running team. Wants to go to play action. They tried on an early down, just not able to hold onto the ball with a good play there by Stearns. Pittman wide left this time. Keep it on the ground. Two-yard game here for Deion Jackson. We go to Kaylee. You guys have been talking about all the changes for the Colts O-line tonight. Well, I asked Ryan Kelly, who has the toughest adjustment to make with guys in three new spots, and he said, this is tough for all of us. This isn't a situation they want to be in now, but he said, with veterans in this group, we'll make it work. Yeah, I mean, they pay these guys, three of them anyway, a ton of money. A ton of money, yeah. And here we are, and the same theme continues, where they're at third and long with his offense. as the coach is straight behind the sticks. Not on schedule. Every cliche in the book. Third down and nine. Blitz coming, and the pass is way too high. Flag is thrown. It's the first of the game, and we will hear the dulcet tones of one Brad Rogers. I think they may get the hold with a rookie there against Draymond Jones. Offense, number 79. That penalty is declined. Result of the play, we got fourth down. There is your rookie. Yeah, Draymond Jones has had a heck of a year. Great start to the season. Move him outside because of the twitch and what he can do as a pass rusher. He's up against a rookie. That was the one question with the shuffling this offensive line. How would the rookie do, especially on third down, against guys like Draymond Jones? That one, Jones wins the battle on third and nine. Already Hawks' third punt of the night. Montrell Washington is back. And he'll catch it at the 10. Gets a block, but nowhere to roam after that. And tackled at the 13 with a little more than four to go in the first quarter in Denver on Thursday night. Said, you know, I thought I'd finish as a Bronco, but as a Seahawk. But there was a lot of stuff going on last year in Seattle. Mike Boone is now the running back to start this drive. up to the 15 he goes. So I mentioned it briefly earlier. So, you know, one of the ways to win a Super Bowl, you go get Tom Brady after 100 years in New England, and the Rams get Matthew Stafford after a dozen years in Detroit. You win a Super Bowl. These two teams are trying to do the same thing. Yeah, and I think what we're finding here in this case, both of them are actually on the same path where it's going to take some patience right now. I mean, it's easy to point to the quarterback, but when you have offensive line that still hasn't been sacked, DeForest Buckner is there. So back they go to the 16-yard line, third and goal. Yeah, 6'7", 295, just shooting this gap, going actually right over top of the center. Lloyd Cushenberry, you can see the push from the backside. Just a collection, and Gonque also was able to get in there with quickness. So just talked about how this Denver offense, for whatever reason, When they get down here, they just struggle, especially up front. They were in there once tonight early. Had to settle for a field goal. Wilson has a little bit of time here. Everybody's covered. And then throws it over the head of Saubert. So, again, the crowd, after that 51-yarder, got excited. And you can hear the boos raining down. They're frustrated. high expectations and goals and you don't blame them obviously but this is an offense that's going to go back to the drawing board again in trying to figure out the red zone that time he said you know what it's an offense that's struggling let's just drop 8 not give him anywhere to throw the ball ends up throwing it away and of all things that one gets blocked and that's Grover Stewart who blocks it so an easy for McManus what would amount to be a chip shot field goal. And now the Boos really rained down. Here's the block. It remains tied at six. At this point, after that blocked field goal. To the 24 come the Colts. Deion Jackson. The running back. And they fake it to him. Pass is incomplete. Let's go to Kaylee. Well, guys, another injury to ask. No. I'm not feeling that just over here. The game is like sort of bad. It's not good. Yeah. Who knows? Maybe a game will break out here. Second down and 10. And that's at the 19-yard line. Stuck there is Jackson. Alex Singleton makes the tackle. Third and 15. At least the defense gives the crowd something to cheer about. Yeah, Singleton in for Jewel here. And kind of the same results right here. Watch the job that he does in just kind of sensing this. You'll see 72 Smith try to get out there to him, but just too quick to react and see exactly what was unfolding in front of him and kind of laughing about how easy that was. Third down and 15. Three receivers and a bunch to the right. Ryan hangs in, throws, picked at the 27-yard line. On a third down and 15, trying to jam it in. Matt, unbelievably frustrated, and it's Caden Stearns again with the interception. Watch him show like he's going to play half, and then he ends up robbing. He'll come down, just kind of freelance, hanging out, hanging out, reading the eyes, and then steps in front. Second interception of the night. It actually fools Matt Ryan. Second time he could not locate Stearns in coverage. It throws his second pick. And both to Stearns. Yeah. He had two interceptions as a rookie last year. Second year guy out of Texas. Well, Russell Wilson has great field position. See what he can do with it. from the 27-yard line. Flushed out and just drops into the ground to the feet of Saubert. Pressured that time by Grover Stewart, the guy who blocked the field goal attempt, second down and 10. Well, you know, 14 years in Atlanta, this is the way Indianapolis, the portion of his career, starts. nobody more frustrated with this offense than number two he been a long time since he's seen those kind of emotions out of Matt Ryan he's just normally very cool second and ten under any circumstance but not tonight second and ten Wilson has protection, fires and then it's incomplete as it turns out, Kenny Moore helping to break it up. That's Andrew Beck to tie it in. Look for a moment as if he would catch it. Battered away third down to ten. Beck's got the size, but the athletic ability looks like he gets a hand. They play a lot of zone, but here he is locked down man-to-man. Still has that instinct to locate the football and being great position there against the big, tall Cortland Sutton. Buffalo and New England last year with Carolina. Second down and five. as they go empty here with 5 second down to 15 as they go 5 wide 4 man rush again going deep nobody home on that one either Sutton was the closest to it crowd of course tells the Broncos what they think about it, 3rd and 15 there's an example right there of the receivers and Russell Wilson just not being on the same page, it's easy to look at that and say what in the heck is going on why did they call that play but that's a miscommunication And receiver reads one coverage and makes an adjustment. Russell reads another coverage. And, again, that's the part, that's a great example of what Nathaniel Hackett is trying to figure out an answer to to avoid those miscommunications. Caught inside the 30, and then a nice tackle is there to make sure that Hamler didn't get a first down. Isaiah Rogers stops him there. It'll be fourth and five. We knew coming in what Gus Bradley would do with keeping his secondary back and just trying to say, okay, we're going to make you throw underneath. We're going to make you have to drive the ball. We're going to rally and tackle. We're not going to give up any yards after the catch. Force him into that red zone and squeeze him. And here, because Denver self-destructed a bit on that false start, got him behind the sticks, and then they were able to sit back and play soft zone on that third down. McManus made a 33-yarder earlier. Now this is a 44. and all the points in the game are off the foot of the nine-year veteran Brandon McManus. Early second quarter, Denver 6. Indianapolis, nothing. And loves it. Yeah. Imagine him calling plays. You show up on a Saturday morning, he's out there calling plays. I'm sure he doesn't take it very serious. So Wright gets the job, and then Luck is his starter. He retires. Brissette comes in, and Phillip Rivers comes there for a year. Then Wentz, that didn't work out. You know, those two horrible games at the end of the season, including the one in Jacksonville that cost them a chance at the playoffs. And here's Ryan. So Frank, a quarterback himself, who affected maybe the greatest comeback in NFL history in a playoff game with Buffalo against Houston. He's the guy trying to get his team on track. filled up Lindsey for a game of two. It just seems like the unexpected retirement of Andrew Luck has left this franchise just searching for answers, not just at that position. You know, they had a good run last year, came down in the last week of the season, heavily favored against Jacksonville, come up short. Now they find themselves with Matt Ryan, seems to be a logical answer late in his career, and just off to a very, very slow start in his first five weeks. Yeah, Lindsey to the 32. I mean, they brought in, you know, Phillip Rivers. They didn't know how long he would last. Phillip goes a year. They thought maybe Wentz would be the guy, a lot younger, of course. But, no, that wasn't the case here. And they can only hope that Ryan, who's 37, can be the guy at least for a short period of time. You look at Matt Ryan now, and he is in phenomenal shape. I mean, he takes care of himself, still has that strong arm. This is just an offense that they have gotten in their own way many times, and they just have not been able to find this rhythm. Bunch receivers to the left. Ryan looks that way, avoids the sack, and completes it up to the 46 to Michael Pittman for a first down, tackled there by Jonas Griffith. And here's Matt Ryan making a play. I mean, this is him waiting patiently in the pocket, waiting and waiting and waiting, and then eventually, against his own defense, he finds his guy Pittman, who's got good length, sneaking in behind those linebackers, but second time we've seen him complete a pass where he's back there, great protection to give him that chance. Four of seven is Ryan. 47 yards, Deion Jackson. And a two here, Josie Jewell makes the tackle. Nine minutes to go in the first half in Denver. This is an offense that wants to be able to win the line of scrimmage, dominate with an offensive line, and then put Matt Ryan into positions where he's got an advantage with the play-action game. But when you're not running the ball, even with Jonathan Taylor, you're not running the ball, boy, it's like a virus to your computer what you're trying to do with your offensive system. Eighteenth play for the Colts. Inside receiver Jerry Judy. And you can see the speed and how quickly he gets down that seam down the middle. Russell sees it right away. The safety split. Makes the throw. But pretty good coverage there by the big linebacker. 33-yard attempt now coming up for Brandon McManus, who's the last of the Broncos in the Super Bowl championship team of 2015. Right down the middle. And the first drive is paid off with a field goal to make it 3-0. Denver. Her favorite Bond. You're going to go Sean Connery, or who's your favorite James Bond? Connery. Connery, yeah. Come on, come on. You're the Roger Moore guy? I'm a way back guy. That shuffled offensive line, you can take a look at what's happened with the Colts here. Weeks one through three, that was the setup. But they weren't creating any spaces there, so running in rookie Will Fries. And this is the big shuffle tonight. Moving Pryor over to right tackle where he's more comfortable. Smith into guard where he played in college. And bringing up the rookie, Ryman. See if this works out. This is the second series. Keep in mind, they're trying to communicate. You've got a rookie left tackle on the road. Offense, it's still trying to quit self-destructing and stay ahead of the chains. Deion Jackson's now the running back. That rookie's going to see a lot of trouble at a certain point tonight. Meanwhile, the catch is made here. And that's Deion Jackson spinning away. and the guy who was the number three back, of course, behind, you're talking about, you know, one of the best in the league in Jonathan Taylor, and Hines, who we'll get a report on as soon as we can, picks up a first down on the gain of 21. How about Matt Ryan? You know, here's a guy that's been criticized for taking sacks and fumbling the ball. This time waits as long as he can with that new offensive line in the pocket to finally check it down to Deion Jackson, and Deion Jackson makes a nice play after the catch. Jackson's second of your 14th game in the NFL first catch. Played at Duke. Keep it on the ground. Give it to him again. Nice little start for him tonight. Off of Quinton Nelson. Blocked. Pulling on the play. Takes it across the 50-yard line. Second down and five. Comes in tonight with just two carries on the season. And he's a guy that's more physical of all the backs they have. About 220 pounds. lower his shoulder. Now we get a chance to see Phillip Lindsey making his homecoming elevated from that practice squad. Cannot imagine the energy and excitement he has with family and friends in this stadium here to watch him. 2,000 yard seasons here was a major crowd favorite hometown boy. Stays in the block and Ryan's going to get sacked at the 45 yard line. So Lindsey does his job, but up the middle comes D.J. Jones to knock him down. Third down and 11. A great defensive front, D.J. Jones this time, 97 leads the way. What a battle here against Ryan Kelly, the center, one of the tops in the NFL. You can just see the hand-to-hand combat and then the quickness to be able to get around him. Phillip Lindsey comes in on Browning to help out with pass protection, but it's the interior. You know, Draymond Jones and D.J. Jones in the inside of this defense. is really a dynamic duel with great quickness and suddenness in the middle. Jackson comes back in the game. Four-man rush. Ryan steps up, flips it to Jackson, and he can only get back to the 49-yard line before he gets gang-wrestled. Shows your jewel right there, so it is fourth and seven. They are sitting back early in this game on Matt Ryan, taking away his shots that he wants to take. And how many times already have we seen him checking it down? just has to check it down because his receivers that he wants to try to get the ball downfield just taken away by good coverage. Montrell Washington, the rookie is back there. That Hawks' first punt was only 31 yards and spun back toward the Indy side of the field. This time it's angled and caught at the 14-yard line. They're caught by Washington. Six and a half to go a million years ago, baby. The great Silky. Thunder, of course, is the mascot here for the Denver Broncos. Original AFL team back in 1960. Melvin Gordon is the running back as they start here from the 14-yard line. A little flip back to him. Nothing doing. Picks up about a yard. Kenny Moore makes the stop. So Nathaniel Hackett, who gets the job because of his offensive prowess, basically, in Green Bay running that great offense there, along with Matt LeFleur. Tied for the fewest in touchdowns. Second most in more action, because Justin Simmons went on IR after week one. One of the top safeties in the league. Second down and ten now. Wilson in the pocket. Fires to high. And a flag comes in. Pass intended for Saubert. Rodney McLeod is there. And that's where the flag comes in. And the officiating crew will discuss. We get Terry's thoughts on this just because he hooked him at the break of his route. Defense, number 26. Ball places the spot of the foul. Automatic. First down. It was initial contact when he came out of his break. Watch 26. Right at the end of the... He breaks there, then he grabs onto him initially. And that's the only contact that there was, Terry. Terry, you've seen worse. I don't see any significant hindrance on that play at all. Not a foul for defensive pass interference. Picture of that next to Tiki-Tak in the dictionary. Five and a half to go in the half. Keep it on the ground here. Four-yard run for Melvin Gordon. So Gordon coming off that problematic game last week, to say the least, has now carried seven times but for only 12 yards. Pretty good push in the middle there. I thought coming in, just looking at this game on paper, between Grover Stewart and DeForest Buckner, the two inside Colt defensive linemen who are very quick and athletic against Dalton Reisner on one side and Graham Glasgow, that that would be a big advantage for the Colts. But pretty good job here early getting a good push. On second down and six. The ball comes out again, and it's picked up. But was he down? Flag is on the field. Jeez. Wow. Man, oh, man. The 43-yard line. Holding. Offense. Number 83. Ten-yard penalty. Second down. He was down, but the ball came out. That's on Beck. Andrew Beck, one of the tight ends. Yeah, down for sure. Yeah, knee is down, so he's saying, wait a second. No, no, no, no. Don't count this one. Don't count this one. Andrew Beck just grabbed a hold of the helmet right there. Ocarike, linebacker, trying to make a play, and Andrew Beck just grabs a hold of the side of his helmet and jersey. So, again, another penalty by these offenses moving them backwards. Second down and 16. Five wide here. Everybody into the pattern. Underneath the throws, not caught. By Jerry Judy, he dropped that one, third and 16. You can hear kind of the murmurs around this stadium, the frustration, second down and long. They're just trying to clear it out and to give Jerry Judy has such quickness, a chance to make a play after the catch. But he drops it, but even if he doesn't, man, Kenny Moore, who's much better in the slot than he is on the outside, right there in tight coverage. And Wilson, 50%, 8 of 16. A couple of drops in there as well. 64 yards, so averaging 4 yards per pass attempt. Checks it off underneath. Boone. And he gets spun out of bounds just across the 50-yard line. And so the Broncos now will punt for the third time in the game. Crowd continues to be restless and beyond. And this will be the seventh punt in the game. You've got to think Gus Bradley is down there feeling really good about his scheme and what they're doing against Russell Wilson trying to get the ball downfield. He just can't do it. Waitman with his third punt. Each of his first two have gone 50 yards. And that bounces sideways. The 15-yard line with 3.48. Downtown Denver on a beautiful third. Kelly, Wesley French, who does, but he's an active tonight. So they're all over the place. And Penner's who they took out at right guard, and now he finds himself back in the lineup now, but as a center. Ryan fires, caught. Pittman, we go to Kaylee. And Al, we don't yet know if we'll see Ryan Kelly back out here. The Colts tell us he is questionable to return with a hip injury. He was able to jog off the field on his way to the locker room, though. Just continues. You get the rookie left tackle having a very difficult night. Kelly Pro Bowl leads to the last three years. That's how valuable he would be. Comes in the first 15 minutes of the game. Skids out of bounds at about the 34-yard line. with a dozen seconds left in the first. Anthony Chubb can get after the quarterback, and he's smiling because right now they're exactly what they want to see, get Matt Ryan and this offense into those third and obvious situations and attack the offensive line in the pass protection. So the two lowest, well, two of the lowest scoring teams in the league, it's been underwhelming offensively so far, you might say. So far. And you know what I mean. Yes, sir. Of course you do. Yes, sir. All right. Here we go. 3-0 Denver. This drive beginning from the 34-yard line. Wilson. Moving away. Had an 18-yard run earlier. Steps out of bounds up at the 40-yard line. Clock stops for the moment. They'll wind it. And that's going to take us to the second quarter. So end of one. It is Denver. Three and out. Keeping us in the game. Offensively, we just got to find our rhythm. Thanks, Coach. All right, thank you, Kaylee, and thank you, Frank, for stopping by. The coaches don't have to do it. Second and four. It's caught for a first down here by Courtland Sutton. Meanwhile, you just saw Frank talking about, you know, trying to get things going. And we now know that Naheem Hines, who was hurt on the first series of the game, has a concussion, will not return. Oh, boy. And you're talking about an offense, not just tonight, but all year. They have five games in, first quarter points, ten total. They have been down big time in the first half. They've got to find something in a hurry offensively. Put a lot of pressure on their own D. Off play action. Pass that's caught by Gordon, and he has a little bit of room and exploits it. Zaire Franklin makes the tackle, and off he goes into Colts' territory for a gain of 11. Really good job of Russ selling this to the left, waiting, and then dumping it down. And it gives the offensive lineman a chance to get out in front and get to those linebackers. Broncos go up tempo now. No huddle. That's caught. Taking the 38-yard line. Albert O'Quibonon. A third-year man out of Missouri. First down. Trying to get a little bit of tempo, mix that in. just trying to get this Colts defense of Gus Bradley on their heels. Again, we're talking about just small victories right now for either one of these offenses. Positive yards on first and ten. On a second and five, Gordon securing that ball. About a yard shy, third down one. He had all the fumbles that we heard about coming into this game. In the pregame, he's heard about it all week, even though it's a short week, and it's carried over into the game. Put that ball up high where he can take care of it. A lot of times getting that other hand on it when he can, but high-pointing the ball, protecting the football, a major priority for Melvin Gordon in his eighth year after the fumbles he's had in this early part of the season. Went to Wisconsin. He was a freshman when Wilson, after playing at Carolina State, was a senior and spent the one year with the Badgers. Third and one. And he's able to break a tackle, as he has done so often throughout his career, to the 29. You know those Colts are trying to tackle that football as much as they're trying to tackle Melvin Gordon. He can take inspiration. We talked about Tiki Barber before. Look at that. In a five-year period, he had 40 fumbles. and then in a two-year period only for Tom Coughlin came in. And I remember Tiki was kind of walking around all day long without, I mean, beside practicing, just in the cafeteria with the ball secured to his chest. Left tackle looked like he moved there. That's Garrett Bowles. Offense, number 72, five-yard penalty. A lot of times you have these hard cadences and you think it helps the offense, but this is an offensive line that will tell you. They'll admit to it and tell you that we're still ourselves trying to learn Russell Wilson's cadence and his rhythm. He's known all across the league when he's at Seattle drawing defenders off sides, and yet here is on offense still at week five, trying to get comfortable understanding what he's doing. They've had a lot of false starts. First and 15, and Wilson deep down the left sideline, but that's out of bounds. Stephon Gilmore, three or four years ago, he was the defensive player of the year. Now a Colt incomplete, second and 15. Yeah, it is 11th year, you know, and still has that ability to match up with that top receiver. In Denver, even though they have the lead. These guys have a winning record, and Russell tonight is 11 of 20 for 87 yards. Ryan is 12 of 19 for 140 Ryan throws open man 39 yard line Alec Pierce I think the league anytime you see something work I think general managers and head coaches say let's find that let's use that as the model it's tough to do one little difference here is that Denver really to get Wilson gave up a ton yeah Indianapolis only gave up a third round track right to get Ryan yep second down and five full carrot here by the ex Lindsay up to the 42 yard line I mean they were five draft picks including first and second in two consecutive years Drew Locke also goes to Seattle Meanwhile, Ryan comes for a song and a dance. Yeah, yeah. Denver's going all in with what they think Russ can do to this offense. We just haven't seen it play out yet. We'll see the adjustments that Frank Reich and his offensive staff make. Remember, Ryan Kelly went out of this game. One of the better centers in the league, Danny Pinner, is in for him. but how they try to help Matt Ryan in this offense out. He joined us late by him. Hines, who started as the starting running back tonight, out after two plays, and he's done for the night with a concussion. And that passes at the 46-yard line, pulled in by Alec Pierce, third and three. That time, Browning almost got the sack instead of first down. Are you kidding me with Matt Ryan sitting there, sitting there? This offensive line has struggled all year to protect him. He throws. I don't even know if he saw where he was throwing it. He gets hit as he throws his ball. And I think we're starting to see him believe. He's finding a guy that he believes in. And that is Pierce, the rookie out of Cincinnati. Targeted him six times. He's caught five as Pierce for 48. Deion Jackson is the back. And he gets to the 44-yard line. There's the second-year man out of Duke. Forgive me for getting excited there. We haven't seen a lot of offense. No, I get you. I was like, wow. Right. That was beautiful. Great throw and a heck of a catch there by the rookie. No, you weren't being farcical. No, absolutely. Nice to see you. Second down and eight. George Payton, the general manager of the Denver Broncos. Man who brought Wilson to town. Second down and eight. Good hole here. Jackson exploits it. To the 31-yard line goes Deion. Jackson is now carried seven times for 25 yards. In behind the tight end, boy, Ali Cox. This is a tough block right here by Granson to work and try to keep that outside defender from getting down inside. He pushes him. So instead of pushing him out, he just ends up having to push him back kind of into the wash of that defensive front. And a really good job of the vision there by Deion Jackson of finding that hole. Jackson again. Nothing doing this time. Deshaun Williams making the stop behind the line of scrimmage. Loss of one. Good job here. Just getting off of the rookie. Remember, we talked a lot about Ryman, the left tackle who's been inserted there to start. Trying to sustain that block, but Williams, Deshaun Williams, good job of pressing him and then using those hands to get off that block. Ryan, pump fake, and down the sideline, but the coverage was great. And you've got Kareem Jackson, Phillip Lindsey, nothing open there. Third down and 11, there's Ryan Kelly. came out, went back to the locker room hip injury, so he's still on the bench and Pinter's still in there at center Let's keep an eye on the rookie here you just saw even the last one, the last play the pressure there forced Matt Ryan to scramble away from that pressure he's going to have Draymond Jones across from him to his outside He picks him up, does the rookie, but Ryan is forced to throw off his back foot and incomplete because Bradley Chubb comes from the other side and forces the issue. Fourth down. We saw Baron Browning use his exact same move, and this time Chubb says, I'm going to use it as well. Game only 57 yards. Look out. Ryan able to avoid the sack. Flag is thrown, and he throws him. That's tipped him. That's incomplete, and we'll see about the flag. Tipped by Kareem Jackson on that play. Brad Rogers will tell us what's going on. You don't expect Matt Ryan to pull out of there, and I think it surprised maybe even his own offensive lineman. Holding. Offense. Number 79. Third offensive holding call for the rookie lineman. You know, they're going to start chipping and start using a tight end. They're going to have to. he does a pretty good job here holding the point there and then he grabs onto that jersey it's pretty obvious right there in front of the official that experiment is not working particularly well no three penalties in the first 25 minutes of the game or less second and 18 Ryan has time throws, that's caught, and into Denver Church, where the ball comes out. It was Pat Sertan, that was Alec Pierce, who's off to a good start in his rookie season out of Cincinnati, and they're able to maintain possession. Yeah, it looked like Paris Campbell ended up jumping on top of that. Pierce, the rookie out of University of Cincinnati, he comes across, he gives you an idea, you think of him as a vertical threat, but boy, after the catch, and there's Sertan knocking it loose, and a heads-up play there by one. Paris Campbell to jump on it before two Broncos are right there, and they pick up that first down. Sutan knocking it away, and the ball is spotted at the 43, which gives them a first down. After a second and 18, Lindsey is there again. Pastor Tan, you remember his father, of course, played for many, many seasons. He was a great player. This kid could be at the end of his career, Could be as good as anybody in the league at corner. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you could make a case for him right now. He's one of the most humble superstars you're ever going to meet. But loves to be out on an island. Went up against Devontae Adams last week. Held his own against one of the top receivers, if not the top receiver in the league. Lindsey. Freaks away. Shades of his rookie season here. Forced out by Jackson. and that's good for a gain of 16 and a first down. We know about what Quentin Nelson can do when he comes around. Watch this open up when he comes around. That is a great matchup with Chubb against Nelson. I'll tell you, this Lindsey, he runs hard. That's what he's been known for. He's going to run through those arm tackles, fired up to be back home. Frank Reich told us on our Zoom, listen, we may go gain a one, gain a two, gain a one. We've got to be patient. It may not be pretty. We've got to be patient with this scheme against our running game. Here's Jackson. Checking with Kaylee. Al, Phillip Lindsey acknowledged to me his time on the Colts practice squad was frustrating. Because it allowed him to see the NFL through a different lens. He told me he's kept his head in the playbook 24-7 and worked at every practice as if he was starting. Lindsey said he came to understand that these experiences, the highs and the lows, are what make you a veteran in this league, Al. Yeah, sure. The highs, of course, came in those first two seasons. Over 1,000 yards in each. But then, injuries and whatnot. Bouncing around and maybe he's found a home here now. Second and nine. Ryan, good protection this time. Throws. It's picked off at the 15-yard line by Stearns. Out to the 37. He goes. So Ryan at time tried to thread it and could not And a good looking Indianapolis drive ends with that Morocco's get it back Up 6-7 Here last year Traded to the Rams and winds up with some jewelry Ryan would love to have that one back Just did not see Safety that time Caden Stearns What quarterback would not like to have it in this season? Oh yeah, he's looking at that Saying, oh, especially a veteran From the 38-yard line The pass is behind The intended receiver Gordon Sutton, back to the pick we go Now he's been able to Get away with some of these throws Where he's looking left, looking left waits, waits. Now look to the left. There's 30. Just reading his eyes and just sinks into coverage and takes away that potential completion to Kylan Granson. And Stearns got in his team. So three accepted penalties. Born in Austria began playing at age 14 for the Vienna Vikings. Local club team played wide out. Winds up here in this unenviable task of trying to protect Ryan's blind side as a rookie. Second and eight. Ryan fires, caught Pittman across the 50, and thrusts forward to the 44-yard line. They'll come to the line, even though they have a ton of time here with all the timeouts in their pocket. First down. Great separation there by Pittman, getting away from the nickel there. Williams ran away from him on that shallow cross. And that's a little behind, but caught by Pierce. Ryan stole his word no they say no now almost was able to hold on behind him Ryan talking about Pierce glowingly the other day yeah I think he feels they're close you know in getting into sync I think he feels comfortable with Pittman and I think he's close with Alec Pierce we've seen him go to him tonight Pierce has so much upside at 6-3-2-11 Ryan in the pocket throws and that is along the sideline with Paris Campbell the officials will check and confer and say no he's out of bounds so Campbell able to hold on Darby is there for the coverage incomplete third down and ten great job of working back to the ball to give Paris Campbell a chance he comes all the way back to this football and Campbell tries to get Oh, the heel. There's the heel. The toe heel thing. The right foot's good. The left foot was. And then that heel came down. And that's Darby who was covering on the play. Ronald Darby, the eight-year veteran. Third down and ten. Damari Mathis, a rookie, now comes in to supplant him. And timeout will be taken. Well, you got a rookie in there, Central Michigan, picked in the third round. Mentioned Warren in Austin, didn't play football in his teens. Yeah, he's had a tough night, which was anticipated when they moved him up and they moved Friar over to right tackle. But, man, they're not changing. He continues to be on that island. And, you know, it's just more about consistency. Two or three, he's holding up, and then there'll be a holding call or a false start. Type of game you'd like to have in the fifth regional on CBS on Sunday. Third and ten from the 44-yard line. Ryan. Flag is down again, and the catch is made to the 26. Ashton Doolin. I think he had a free play there. It looked like Barron Browning, who had that quick jump earlier for the sack. This time, I think he got caught leaning. Defense, number 56. The penalty has declined. The result of the play is a first down. Funny because the Colts started to back up as if the penalty was on them. They're just so used to it. Yeah, right. It's just like, oh, here we go. But instead, they catch Browning. And again, he's trying to get that great jump. Colts hit a big completion there. this drive began back at their own 15 they had one good drive the last drive was a good one ended in an interception this is the 10th play of the drive it is caught and backing up forward progress with Pittman close to a first down we're starting to see a little urgency here right I mean they're a minute away from taking the lead in this first half so you saw Ryan say we have plenty of time let's huddle up like the two time outs at the 15 Pittman picked up enough on the forward progress they've gone from their own 15 to the Denver 15 Ryan nearly gets sacked and then does get sacked Bradley chubb the first guy in there meanwhile now you got ball coming out. Yeah, it looked like the ball came out when Jewel and Jones hit him. It was a fumble recovered by another player of the offense. The ball is brought back to the fumbling spot. They're bringing it back to the spot where he did fumble. They're calling it a fumble. Timeout taken here, but now it's second and 28. Pocket just collapses. Again, there's the rookie going against Chubb. Jewel blitzes. He gets in there. Browning has a chance. Eventually, they chase him down with Jewel, the linebacker, and Draymond Jones. His body looks like he's still hit up. I don't know if he ever hit the ground there before the ball came out. So Ryan with his 10th fumble. But at least this one is retained by the Colts. but that is a loss of 18 and if nothing else we'd like to at least stay in field goal range second and 28 well there you go Kurt Warner that's not a bad list to be on when Warner's on the list anytime you get on a list with Kurt Warner it's a win officials are getting together if they're talking about the clock or the spot. Let's see what they say here. Clock operator, please put 30 seconds on the game clock, please. 30 seconds. Thank you. So they cost them another 11. And Reich is saying, what is that about? Normally they put more time back on the clock. second and 28 Pittman underneath Ryan's going to get sacked again and that's going to pretty much take him out of field goal range there is Baron Browning you know him well played for the Buckeyes timeout taken here it's going to be third and 38 he comes here and then works his way all the way underneath to try to test the communication of the offensive line. And it worked out perfectly prior to the right tackle. Unable to work there laterally to get down to help up. And you can see Browning, who's feeling good tonight, stepping in for Randy Gregory. Here's the look of a man who's been sacked four times and a half, 19 times this season. And that leads the NFL. They go from the 15-yard line all the way back to the Denver 43. And a third and 38. So if they don't get a yard here, you're looking at about a 61-yard field goal attempt. The only good news about that would be at altitude. Third and 38. Tries to at least get them into better range. And that's taken out of bounds by Alec Pierce. So it's going to be fourth down. And at least they'll try to tack on three. Chase McLaughlin will come in. Rodrigo Blankenship was waived. McLaughlin with Cleveland most recently. Free agent. And they'll spot this ball at the 42. So a 52-yard attempt for 17 seconds. Matt Hawk is the holder. Well, what do you know? 6-3, we are back in a half minute to begin the third quarter. And we have a flag here at the 45-yard line, which means somebody came across the line. In all likelihood. Offside. Kicking team number 45. Five-yard penalty. First down. Okay. D.J. Speed. So Hackett is going to make them kick it again. Hopeful of some crazy run back here with 12 seconds. Kaylee, what you got? Al we just learned that Broncos cornerback Ronald Darby is questionable to return to this game with a knee injury. Okay thank you we saw him limp off before. So you get the two corners. Sertan on one side Darby on the other. Probably see more of Damari Mathis already missing Randy Gregory. We'll see more of K-1 Williams in all likelihood. That little attrition In the two teams coming in tonight and continuing on And they'll run it back seven yards in Montreux Washington Rookie will stay on his feet but not for long and the ball is out at the 13-yard line So he's trying to make something happen and he's very fortunate that his team recovered it We still want to go for found in particular you know you're trying to make something happen Yeah bounce off guys and the next thing you know look out and he's a great return man as a young player But he he spent a quiet first half I mean you get it but think about the time when we are here at the end of the half trying to make something happen potentially backfires gives the Colts an easy field goal there to tie this game up it's Dallas flowers 33 came in and got it loose a kneel down will in this first half and they go to the half with this baby a 6-3 game coming up after the break Mercedes Benz halftime show with Carissa and the gang Let's try to get their team, you know, out of this quicksand that they're in. Then we'll find out who survives. Denver to get the ball. At the 25, moments ago, Kaylee spoke with Nathaniel Beckett. Well, Coach, you came into this game looking to find rhythm on offense. What do you want to see in the second half? Yeah, like you said, you want to get some rhythm. I mean, we've had some great opportunities, and we've just got to finish them off. And your defense, without Randy Gregory, how do you assess what they've been able to do? I mean, the four sacks, I mean, they're getting after it. And they're having a great rush. They've got to keep that thing up, and we've got to finish this game. Thanks, Coach. Appreciate it. All right. The thoughts of the first-year head coach coaching his fifth game, and he starts here with Wilson and company at the 25-yard line. Mike Boone is the running back. Wilson rolls, throws, caught and that's going to be a first down on the first play that's Eric Saubert stop by Zaire Franklin gain a 10 get him outside and take advantage of an aggressive Indianapolis defense really fly into the football there on first and 10 get him outside where he's comfortable and make an easy throw here to Saubert to start the second half Wilson a 10 of 18 79 yards Quick throw in behind the intended receiver Eric Tomlinson who would be listed as your number three tight end second and ten Go to 13 personnel with three tight ends and they work right down the seam Try to get the matchup that they want, the coverage that they want works out perfectly See the corner work outside? Safety's in the middle. You got the seam right there, and the ball's just thrown behind Tomlinson. You had a big game there. Wilson, pressure, and he will go down. The ball comes out. He gets it back, though. DeForest Buckner extracting it. Wilson recovers his own fumble. And that will set up a third and 18. Cushenberry works to the left, creating a one-on-one to the right, which is a mismatch with Buckner at his length. 6'7", 295. And he's able to use that extension to get away from the guard. You said it out. Ball on the ground. Wilson lucky to get that ball back. So Ryan fumbled. They kept possession. Before the hand, Wilson fumbles to keep possession here. He's under pressure again. Settles for a throw to the outside. Low throw. That's caught there by Mike Boone. And it's a very rapid three and out. McCara K. covering on the play. Again, Gus Bradley just dropping everybody back. Working here, working back. Underneath. And it's third down and long. Moving those safeties around. Making Russell Wilson and these receivers who are still trying to find a rhythm. and get comfortable with one another, show them something pre-snap to post-snap, and keep making them be frustrated. Fourth punt for the left-footed Waitman. Return from the 21 by Isaiah Rogers. Spilled up in the 35-yard line. It has been one frustrating night. It's really testing this offensive line. And, you know, Browning was out to the outside. He goes up. And then he's able to work underneath Chubb. You know, when you have Chubb and Browning on the same side on third down, man, that is a lot of quickness and a lot of challenging for an offensive line and their communication. McLaughlin out to try to tie the game with a 51-yard field goal. High snap. Hawk gets it down. And McLaughlin bangs it through with a 51. Good job by the holder, Hawk. And with 8.51 to go in the third quarter in Denver, 6-6. And a touchback here. So for years, Pat Bolin owned the team. And then he had the, when he got dementia and couldn't run the team, At least the family still owned the team. And then the Walton Penner family bought the team for four point. There they are. The four point six five billion dollars. By far the most paid for a North American sports franchise. So they're in charge right now. Bring in a new coach. Of course that was hired beforehand. Bring Wilson in beforehand. And they start from the 25. and now they're going to give an opportunity for the first time in the game to divine Zygbo a fourth year back out of Nebraska as his first carry of the game. There's nowhere to go. Right now in the middle, the trenches of this defensive line doing a good job of holding the point of attack. You know, Denver, we've been talking about Denver and their offense. They only had two drives in this game where they've been able to sustain something. Other than that, and it was a good job of mixing run and pass. Other than that, they've been three and out, not getting anything going at all. Second and eight, off play action. Wilson going deep downfield into a lot of traffic. And somehow, someway, it is caught inside the 25-yard line. The two guys on each side were there, Portland Sutton and Montreux Washington in the same area. And he's able to come down with it. Unbelievable catch, 51 yards. Yeah, two receivers in the same spot. You got a referee that goes down that may have helped here to open up this receiver. He's not throwing that ball, in my opinion, to Washington. He's trying to get the ball to Sutton, who ends up grabbing it. The official affects McLeod. The back judge there gets in the way of the safety. McLeod, they both, like you said, have their hands on the ball. Two on two. Of course, it's the rookie Washington who is probably in the wrong spot. But they'll take anything at this point. Now, it's Washington, the rookie, and he gets taken down by O'Karake. Appears to be a little short of the first down. Back judge got caught in the wash on that 51-yarder. He was trying to bail, right? I mean, he was doing his best to get out of the way. He's going, wait a minute, you got two guys down here. What's going on? Right. He's trying. He sees, oh, I'm in the middle of this. And McLeod, 25, is impacted. It's like a screen set there by the back judge. Greg Steed is the man who was caught in the washing. This is Melvin Gordon carrying the ball inside the 10, and it's going to be first and goal. Words I thought I would never speak tonight. Well, we finally see that chess match between Gus Bradley, the defensive coordinator of Indy, and Russell Wilson. Again, they're familiar with each other in their days in Seattle. Gus determined not to give away those deep shots downfield, and they finally hit him for one with the assist from the back judge. I don't think they planned for two guys to be in the same place and work on defending that from the nine-yard line. to the outside. Cannot get around the corner. Gordon again, that time taken down by Bobby O'Carake. Second and goal from outside the 10. Carake, just nobody gets up to him. This defensive line eating up those linemen in the tight end. See him in the background, 58, using the vision. These linebackers without Shaquille Leonard doing a really good job of holding down the court at that second level of this defense. Remember, Denver has struggled in the first four weeks of the season in this area. It's been a blast in the entire league in red zone touchdowns. And for the 16, he responded. He was morose after the game last week. Of course, he's had so many fumbles in the last year and a half, and three of them have been scooping scores, including a huge one last week. Had very emotional at the end of that game last week. Second and seven. That pass is caught up at the 44-yard line by Courtney Sutton, the top receiver. Rodney McLeod makes the tackle there, and it's third down and two. Melvin Gordon, I think there's nobody more excited to be back out in the field than number 25. You know, people start questioning if he can be the guy. They don't have a choice. Javante Williams is down. He's going to have to step up as a veteran eighth-year guy. He knows what he's capable of doing. And, again, I think he's anxious to prove that he can be that guy. Third and two. Wilson surveys. Throws. Right there. Hits Jerry Judy for a first down into Indy territory. Tackled at the 45-yard line. Watch Russell here hesitate. He looked inside to K.J. Hamler. And then he's thinking about that and comes off of it and goes to the outside. A little double slant. He has the option to go inside or outside. coverage a little bit tight so he came off of it and there's Judy who he seems to be getting more and more in sync with kind of taking him under his wing with this new offense really thinks that they can do great things together. Hamler in motion play action Wilson slides to his left throws caught Melvin Gordon makes the catch and picks up 13 and another Denver first down Tackled by Ocaricae. Anything to get Melvin Gordon going, whether it's running the football or flipping it to him out of the backfield, just a miscommunication by the Colts' defense. You know, Colts are, Gus Bradley, who coached at Seattle, knows Russell Wilson very well. He's thinking, no deep shots tonight. Let's keep everything in front of us. We'll give the underneath throws. Make them earn this tonight. No cheap shots. through the middle, and nothing is happening there. And again, you can see the way he's holding the ball, making sure he's secure. I'll tell you what, if nothing else, he has to feel a lot better than he did. I mean, can you imagine had he fumbled on the first carry tonight, holding it high inside, much like Tiki Barber did after he had fumble issues several years ago with the Giants. Look at that, Al. You're all over him. On this catch, and also the run up the middle, he's locking that ball down. Second and ten. Wilson. You know he can run. You've watched him for years. And he's to the 13-yard line for a first down. So Russell Wilson, everybody covered, was able to take off, and it's an 18-yard game. Ngocle, the defensive end, loses contained right here with an inside move. One thing about Russell Wilson, he hasn't done it a lot this year, but we all know what he's capable of doing, and he just kind of baits the defense by looking downfield once he got outside, just making that secondary think, you better be careful, and then he uses that speed to be able to pick up those big yards and get out of bounds. So the Broncos have really struggled when they get inside the 20. There it is, only three touchdowns, lowest percentage in the NFL, three out of ten drives inside the 20-yard line. Wilson, look over the middle and then to the left, and that's incomplete. trying to go to Cortland Sutton in the end zone. It'll be second down and 10. I think this is the entire ballgame. I mean, Gus Bradley, again, I think he's willing with his scheme to give up some yards underneath. If you're going to run the ball, so be it. It's going to come down to the execution in the red zone. You just showed with the graphic that Russell Wilson in this offense dead last in the NFL. The Colts will take their chances in this area, try to lock it down and force the Broncos into field goals. Eighth play of the drive. A little flip back to Gordon. To the outside, he goes. Nothing doing there. The Colts are right there. They're throwing for a loss. Kenny Moore comes up from the secondary to take him down. Makes it third down and 12 after a loss of two. Kenny Moore does a nice job of keeping contain. I'll tell you, Zire Franklin, the linebacker who has stepped in for Shaq Leonard, also doing a good job. He's right there, 23 in the foreground. Kenny Moore keeps the contain, and there's 44, making it tough again on this Broncos offense. in the red area. Now Gordon is out. They bring Mike Boone in. Former Viking. He flanks Wilson. Three receivers set to the left. Russ looks that way. Fires and it's incomplete in the end zone intended for Jerry Judy who was well covered. That's on by Zaire Franklin. So once again the Broncos get inside the 20 and bog down. Yeah, they give them a different look. They're usually one high defense. This time they go to a two high. It puts a lot of pressure on Franklin to be able to run with that. Of course, came in without Jonathan Taylor. Of course, the big miss. Two-yard gain from Eon Jackson. So Jim Ursa, who had, of course, a ton of success. He had Manning there, and then Luck came in. He is not a happy puppy at the moment. Jim, of course, was so upset after that loss to Jacksonville, at the end of last season. They couldn't go to the playoffs. Opened the door for the Raiders to go in. He said that's enough of Carson Wentz. He got stripped off to Washington. And they try again with Ryan. Second down and eight. Look out. Gets away and then flings it away. Pressure that time by Barron Browning. Second year guy out of Ohio State. He's a good one, too. How about this now? You're going to love this. I thought he was offside. It's, I mean, how fast of a getoff here by 56? Remember, they don't have Randy Gregory, so how are they going to do? Look at that. I mean, it's one thing for Pryor to get out a little bit slow. It's another thing. That was just all on Baron Browning anticipating the snap and showing you how quick he can be. Chubb thinks that there won't be much of a drop-off, even with Randy Gregory, who's one of the top five in QB pressures out. Gives you an idea what Browning can do. Yeah, Gregory out for at least a couple of weeks, maybe as long as six. Third and eight. Ryan to the outside, and that's going to be caught. This forward progress give Alec Pierce a first down, and the way they spot it will not. He's going to be about a yard shy. Ronald Darby is there, and Frank Reich is saying, hey man the forward progress should get him the first down Yeah Alan how about this throw Third and long Nice long throw by Matt Bryant Good route Just not quite far enough The ball brings him back Boy that is really close It sure is He might want to take a peek at that If you go by that why Frank Reich so upset You go by where he caught the ball Well, he could challenge. He's still outside of two minutes, and he will. I don't blame him. These are so tough to win. I mean, you're looking down the line. It's right there on the strike. Yeah, that's right. I think it's a first down. Indianapolis is challenging the rolling on the field of the spot of the catch. All right. Jerry, what say you? It's absolutely a first down, guys. The foremost point of the ball when the defender contacts him is clearly beyond the line to gain. this will get reversed. He'll win the challenge. All right, and we'll step away for just a moment. It's going to get overturned. It'll be a first down. We've got 2.05. All of the timeouts remain for the Colts, plus the two-minute warning. And here comes the official proclamation. Eventually, upon further discussion. Here we go. After review, the receiver possessed the ball at the line to gain. Therefore, it's a first down to Indianapolis. Indianapolis retains their challenge, and they do not lose a timeout. Clock operator, please put the game clock at 2 minutes and 29 seconds, please. 2.29, thank you. Back to 2.29 on the clock. I'm not ready. They'll start this set of downs from the 35-yard line. Again, great route by the rookie, and best ball that Matt Bryan has thrown on the night on that third down. Spread it out here. Gets it away. Caught. 42-yard line. That is hold in there by Lindsey. One of the five out in the pattern. And that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. On the other side, it will be second down and three with Denver leading Indianapolis 6-0. Coming up at the half. They've got to work hard to figure this baby out. 6-0, Denver on top. Two minutes. All three timeouts are in their pocket. Lindsey is the back. Continues to be a rough night for Ryman, a left tackle. Yikes. False starts. Offense, number 79. Five-yard penalty, second down. Four times he's been flagged One was the clock Really found themselves It's so hard to create that identity I think those two examples are so different Than what we're seeing with these two tonight Off play action Wilson loves to throw deep He does here and it's knocked away At the 35 yard line Judy looks for a flag, doesn't get it Rodney Thomas, a rookie from Yale That's it away third and seven. How about the job that Rodney Thomas does here, just getting back and getting in the middle of the field? I mean, this is what Gus Bradley wanted to avoid. You knew they were going to take a shot. Sells it to the outside with a great rout by Judy. But I'll tell you what, the rookie out of Yale, how about he's going up against Russell Wilson. He times this leap perfectly, eyes on the ball, high points it, and knocks it away from Judy. Heck of a play by the rookie. Yeah, where Julian Blackman would normally be, but he's inactive tonight. So it's third down and seven now. And the pass is caught up at this 18-yard line, but well short of the first half by Starbert. So Wilson is now four out of eight. That's a quick three and out. Crowd doesn't like it at all. Fourth down. You know, when they signed Russell Wilson, Nathaniel Hackett all of a sudden dealt with, it's an organization that you go back to the mid-80s, to 2015. 2015. They're used to going competing for Super Bowls and from 16 on it's been not even close. You get Russell Wilson. It's like okay we're back to where we need to be and it just hasn't shown up to this point. Both teams on a quarterback treadmill. 33 is dropped and secured by Isaiah Rogers and we are back in 30 seconds. Drive Starting from the 32-yard line, they have run 10 plays for 33 yards. Can they get something going? You've got Lindsey in the game right now as the running back. Give it to the ex-Bronco. And there he scoots out to the 38-yard line. Wife and son are here. Here's Morgan, and there's a two-and-a-half-year-old Phillip who's more interested in talking to a guy with an old Peyton Manning jersey. Turn around, Dad's in. Here we go. Let's go. Yep, here we go. Where is he? Well, he got positive yards on first and ten, which we haven't seen yet in their first three series. That's great. Picked up six. Second and four. 180! What's up? Toss it back to him. Looks for room and takes the ball up to the 40-yard line, two yards shy. So when Lindsey was here, undrafted free agent, played at Colorado, so well-known in this area, 1,037 yards, nine touchdowns. The next year, 1,011 yards, seven touchdowns in 2020, the COVID year. Got hurt, and then in 2021, he was with Houston and Miami. Yeah, kind of runs with a chip on his shoulder, you can see by his journey. Anytime you're an undrafted free agent, you make the Pro Bowl, and the rest of your career you're out to show everybody that they were wrong. Three tight ends in this set here. Ryan on the run throws, and that's caught, and across the 50, but the flag is down. Jelani Woods, a really good-looking rookie out of Virginia, but Brad Rogers will tell us about it. That was a third and two. Offense, number 79. Ten-yard penalty, third down. Rookie Raymond, and there goes your first down. We just saw a holding call earlier from Raymond. Now it's Barron Browning he's going up against. It was Draymond Jones. This is it on third down. That left tackle, it's a tough ask, the rookie out of Central Michigan, going up against some guys that can rush the quarterback. So like you said, they had the first down. Now they bring it back to a third down and long. They faced third and nine, third and 11, third and seven, and now a third and 12 here in their first four series. Ryman, third round draft choice. Final minute of the first quarter. Ryan under pressure, the sack at the 21-yard line. Bradley Chubb, who had no sacks all of last year, now has four this season. When you reshuffle the deck up front, Pryor goes from left tackle to right tackle. Now you've got a twist and a stunt. So you have Chubb who's going to go flash right before his eyes. And now the linebacker goes right around him. Chubb actually beats him to the inside. But it was the blitzing middle linebacker, Josie Jewell, who came around and got him. But they affected the communication there on third and long. Matt Hawke already with a sore leg. Four punts. And there he did that right hand. Eventually knocked that ball loose. Beck has his hands on it. Looks like a reception. and that is a clinic on not giving up on a play by a defensive back. Can't even see it. Gets his right hand there to take that ball out of the hands and a touchdown for the tight end Beck. Terrific play. Third and ten. Wilson again deep downfield and too deep intended for Jerry Judy. Had a step. Safety was coming over to help. Fourth down, and now McVanish with one more try to try to give them the lead. You had Rodney Thomas back there and Kenny Moore. Judy in this slot. Watch him use K.J. Hamler as kind of a rub there to get separation from Moore. Perfectly designed play. Russell Wilson just needs to put a little bit more air under it to come up with that touchdown. But Judy, with the route and the design there, was there. Next-gen stats powered by AWS. 80% make probability from 45 yards. Out. Unless Grover Stewart gets a hand on it again. But not this time. And the kick is good. With 319. It's a field goal fest. 9-6 Denver. So entering later this month. Touchback. Ball comes out to the 25-yard line. Chicago next week. Yeah, Chicago. Well, again, you know, you've got the Bears, who knows? Washington's had its problems. Who knows? Nobody knows anything. You know that, right? Right. Everybody knows nothing, and nobody knows anything. Yes. Once you can establish that, we can move forward. Words to live by. Let's see how Matt Ryan responds to that pick and the frustration. Starts on the ground. A couple of yards here for Phillip Lindsey making his return here. Lindsey, eight carries tonight, 38 yards along and 15. The Denver defensive, all three coordinators are new coming over. first time coordinators tries to cut it back they are attacking off the edges them is Kwon Williams Denver is so talented up front building that fence Williams along with the edge of this defense instead of just giving up on the play they're helping out safeties. They're not fearing this passing game. The safeties are getting involved in helping defend this running game. So Adriel Averro, who is the first year defensive coordinator, comes over from that Rams staff under Sean McVay who may have another guy, another branch coming off that tree pretty soon. Yeah, absolutely. Third and six. Ryan fires and that's busted up. Kaywon Williams comes in there. Tended for Pittman. Throw is there, but the coverage was perfect, and it's fourth and six. He came over from San Francisco as a free agent. This is great coverage. I mean, you've seen a lot of times Pierce get a chance. This time they go to Pittman, throws it out in front, where he can catch the ball, but he look at him come from behind with that right hand with the cast on it. Broken right thumb. Uses the cast to his advantage. That ball out of there. Matt Hawks, fifth punt of the night. Sky high in the Mile High City in Fair Court at the 22-yard line. And let's check in again with Kaylee. Al, the NFL is spotlighting cancer awareness this week. And at halftime here, dozens of cancer survivors were honored. They ran through the tunnel and got introduced just like Broncos players. This fight like a Bronco initiative was launched after the team's assistant turf manager, Luke Kellerman, was diagnosed with cancer in 2015. He lost his battle in 2017, but his legacy lives on through this campaign now. Yeah, what a great moment for those people. That's a great thrill. You're running out on the field. Oh, yeah. Crowd salutes you. Broncos have it now at the 22-yard line. A little fake toss. Pressure. Pass caught. Goes once again to that tight end that's Saubert. Been in a lot of the action tonight. Saubert has not been targeted six times. Has grabbed three. Colts call a timeout. Yep. Like the aggressive approach there by... Well, Hackett's been under the gun. I mean, the opening night against Seattle, trying to kick a long field goal to win the game. He hired Jerry Rosberg. There he is. Well-respected assistant coach for a lot of years. was the associate head coach in Baltimore, worked under John Harbaugh, special teams, hired him to kind of work on clock management and just have a veteran in the house. Sure, and I think you can see Coach Rosberg there, his face. I think if you're going to go for it and Russell Wilson hurries to the line and then he stands over the line and he's barking out the call, it almost defeats the purpose of what you're trying to do instead of just going and snapping and having to play. And it gave the Colts time to be able to get that time out and regroup. Well, the Broncos did not go for it in the opener of Seattle on fourth down. They do here, or at least line up, fourth and one. Was under center, now he's in gun. Gordon with him. Now Denver. And Denver takes the time. I wanted to take a look at the defensive alignment. Well, you thought NFL games were much faster than college games until tonight, right? I did, through the first three weeks. Right. I was enjoying it. I know. All right, what's your call here? What do you think? What do you see? I mean Russell under center you go with Gordon up the middle and you just trust that they're going to win I like him on the edge I love giving him a chance with his feet to give him an option to run it or throw it can never go wrong yeah I mean Wilson don't you roll them out if you're here to you're rolling the dice you're here to win it you don't want to just get There was a Super Bowl where a lot of people thought he should roll out. Yeah. You know what happened. Fourth and one. Surveys, good protection, slides, fires, broken up in the end zone. Gilmore on Sutton. So the defensive player of the year a couple of years back, and somehow, someway, the Indianapolis Colts, who took their first lead of the game on that field goal, Pull out a 12-9 victory. How fitting the 11th year pro, the veteran, matched up against Sutton. Watch this at the end of the route, and there's the length again. Russell should know better than to try Stephon Gilmore. Tries to go, moves that arm angle down, tries to get around the pressure, but Gilmore again with the instincts to feel, and then the closing speed to get that arm out there and knock it away. Well, that'll make it a much more pleasant red-eye back to Indianapolis tonight. Ryan, I'm a gold figure. They win the game 12-9, seven field goals. Well, post-game coverage with the gang coming right up from Denver after these messages. This is his wheelhouse defending the run. Get off of that block, shed it, and then the quickness to be able to bring him down in the backfield. And he comes out after that play. Comes off in a little bit of distress as they work on him. Second down and seven out from the 32-yard line. Play fake and incomplete again. So many times tonight we've seen balls that look like they're in there. Flag is thrown here. That's to the tight end, Granson. And then they get knocked out. Somehow Matt Ryan got that throw in there and just dropped. Looks like he would have come back anyway. Yeah. Ineligible man and downfield. Offense number 72. Five-yard penalty. Second out. Some of Ryan's receivers tonight have the hands of a sturgeon. looky here there's browning and willing to do with him right now yeah we'll take it back to the locker room replaced by Jonathan Congo number 90 Ryan throws on the run not even remotely close you know when a quarterback drops back to throw and you don't feel threatened I mean he's he's been running out of the pocket but this defense doesn't think he's ever going to run and be a threat you know it's a difference when he's when he's a threat and what he can do to a defense they're able to keep their coverage downfield They're not concerned at all about him pulling that ball down and running the football. Now Browning is out. See if they can still get that pressure. Nick Benito, the rookie out of Oklahoma, to Ryan's right. Third and 12 here. Ryan to the right side and tripped up by Mathis is Mo Alleycox and in comes the punt gang on fourth and five. It goes back to your point about what you said. You don't need to blitz either one of these teams don't have to blitz. Allows you to sit back with three deep and four defenders underneath still get pressure, make Matt Ryan uncomfortable, take everything away downfield for a first down. All you can do is check it down. Putt number seven for Matt Hawke. Good one. Backing up 13-yard line. Washington. Still on his feet. With a whole bunch of white shirts get there collectively at the 15-yard line. Off we go to Soldier Field next week. In Chicago, the Bears and Justin Fields. hosting the Washington Commanders on Thursday night football. You've done games on a soldier field, haven't you, in the past? I've done maybe one or two college games. You like it there? I do. I mean, you go to Chicago, the Bears, I don't care whether they're good or bad. It's the Chicago Bears. It just sounds right. You like the hotel there? Yes. We're okay there? We're okay. Yes, we are. That's a win. There you go. That sums it up right there. It's well tuning in. Yeah. I thought we'd get over 12. We're not done yet. I was thinking in that 15 to 20 range. Oh, we have plenty more to go. Yeah. Five field goals from the 15. Good burst there. And a 17-yard gain. Melvin Gordon exploits that hole. and Gordon with a 17-yard pickup on his 11th carry of the night. He'll follow Hammer right underneath that. K.J. Hamler, not the biggest guy, but all he has to do is get in the way and just try to affect McLeod, which he does, and then you've got the vision and then to be able to get to the backside. Cam Fleming, a nice job of holding that, open that up, just kind of creating that opening by getting a good push inside between that and Hamler. A rare big hole opens up for Melvin Gordon. up to that moment. He had 10 carries for 23 yards. 17 there. Here he goes again. Takes a couple of Colts with him to the 38. Kaylee, what you know? Well, guys, when the Broncos defense gets back out here, they likely won't have Baron Browning. He's a questionable return with a wrist injury. He's been taken to the x-ray room. Colts trying to figure out again what they can do to try to get their offense going. Meanwhile, Russell Wilson. this time. He's under pressure. They've been able to roll him out on first and ten with some success that time. Colts expecting it. Good job of looking backside quickly to find Salbert who settled into that zone. Flip to the outside behind. Judy makes the catch and makes the most of it picking up the first down for Denver. I feel like if the Broncos are ever going to go where they want to go with this offense, it's really going to be the development of Jerry Judy. You know, Sutton is good. You know, you have Tim Patrick who's out with an ACL who's a leader. But I think Peyton would tell you, too, like this, he would love to be able to see these receivers in Denver continue to grow with Russell Wilson and develop chemistry. But Judy is a difference maker if they can get into sync with one another. Final half minute of the third. Wilson fires and it's batted back. And it's second down and ten. That's DeForest Buckner all over the place in the second half. Is he having a night? And we knew coming in he probably was, whether it's penetrating or, again, 6-7 in the middle. I don't think there's anybody else in the league at 6-7 that's in the middle. And look what he can do to a smaller quarterback. You try to throw over top of that, Russell Wilson lists him at 5-11. I don't know how you go over top of DeForest Buckner. He's had a heck of a career two times into the Pro Bowl out of Oregon. Had a great career in college. Of course, came over from the 49ers. Dumps it off. Set up a little bit of a screen here. And that works. Mike Boone inside the Indy 40 all the way down to the 31-yard line. Screen to Boone behind Graham Glasgow. And that's going to take us in a likelihood to the end of the quarter after a 34-yard catch and run. Caught up in man coverage. Once you block the linebacker, O'Karakay, everybody else had their back to Boone. So a lot of room to run. We go to the fourth, 9-6. Denver at the 32 of Indy. And the flag will end the play. You've got a false start, so no play here. Ball from Brad Rogers. False start. Illegal snap by the center. Five-yard penalty. First down. Well, let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. Bit penetration tonight, a lot of it by the Colts defense. Look at the hit of the ball here in the backfield on eight of the 15 carries. It's been linebackers. It's been defensive linemen. And you also see they're just doing a good job overall through three quarters. There's nowhere to go for these backs from Denver. Putting them in a lot of second longs and third longs. And it's a big night for 99. DeForest Buckner kind of leading the way up front. First and 15 to 37. High and incomplete. Tending to court and Sutton. You know what we haven't seen tonight? Any blitzing, really, right? We have a lot of four-man rushes in the whole teams. Yep. You know, when you're winning up front at the line of scrimmage, You don't have to. Gus Bradley, I think, was pretty confident coming in with his defensive front and what they can do. I think every week. This will be a tough defense for people to move the football on. Even last week, Derrick Henry, he was held under 100 yards. They have a talented group and a scheme that's tough to get ready for. And again, minus Shaq Leonard. Concussion last week. He's out at least until the next game. Mike Boone carries here. Third and long. Kind of feeling that play call. They're just trying to position themselves to give themselves a chance at another field goal. You know, it's that kind of game. You get up by six, right, here in the fourth quarter. You put all the pressure on Matt Ryan in that Colts offense. That kind of game. It certainly is, Ollie. You're loving this, right? We're working the Holiday Inn in Aurora later tonight. Third and 13. No, we're not. Wilson throws off balance, picked off at the four-yard line. Rodney Thomas has made a couple of really nice plays tonight. And another one here. And he finally gets tripped up as he approaches the 40-yard line. Listen, man. Russell Wilson is a talented quarterback. We know that. He looks left to Cortland Sutton. And then, without even looking, throws the ball up into coverage. Browning is there. And Bradley Chubb as well. Remember we talked about them being on the same side. It's a really good wrinkle that Denver has been using on these third downs. And it's been effective. Chubb's usually on the outside. He's on the inside. And Browning's been winning out here. The two of them together. The line slides right. But still you've got to block them. Even on the back side, Draymond Jones with a spin move. All three of them collapse that pocket on Matt Ryan. Russell with the helmet on. Ryan with the helmet off. Matt Hawk comes in to punt. Montreux Washington sets up at the 10. He's going to let it go, and it bounds into the end zone. So they get the touchback, and the ball will come out to the 20-yard line with 10.44 to go in regulation. 9-6. for the 9-6 game and a run here of about seven yards. On first down back, we go to Kaylee. Well, Al, the Broncos tell us they evaluated Russell Wilson for a head injury, but the Broncos say he's been cleared, and that's why you see him back out on the field. They took a shot in the helmet there, looked at him in the tent. There was the group in charge of saying, hey, we're taking him out of the game, and they said, okay. Yeah, there's obviously a lot of attention on hits right now to the helmet and guys get checked out by several different doctors. Not just a team doctor, independent doctors as well. He checks out. Now we'll see if he can do anything. Avoids the sack, the first one, but not the second time. They have McLeod coming in and then finally taken down. You have two tight ends and a running back on that side. The tight end ends up working down to his left, but somebody's got to pick up the safety right there. I mean, Gordon's sliding out into the flat, and once that flashed in front of Russell Wilson's eyes, the night that he's had, see the rest of that defense able to eventually bring him down. Accredited to Ngakwe for the moment. Kerrico was also there. Third and ten. Wilson fires caught. and going to be a little short of the first down. Saubert, who tonight has been the second favorite target. Sutton's been targeted eight times. Crowd, of course, booing, but here you are in a fourth and two. Nine minutes to go. And, you know, you just clear it. A simple, easy route, easy read for Russell Wilson. You're up 9-6. At this point, with nine minutes to go, your defense playing pretty well against Matt Ryan. Corliss Waitman Dallas Flowers this time drops back for Indianapolis drifts over Flowers catches it to 20 and down the sideline he goes for about a 9 yard run back 8.33 left in the 4th it's been that kind of a night in Denver pressure do you think it's a drop off for Denver instead Barron Browning is able to step up and emerge Just a relentless approach on the outside. He and Bradley Chubb together have been in that backfield all night when Matt Ryan has dropped back to throw. You know, he's a middle linebacker, outside linebacker type of guy, off the ball in college at Ohio State. See what he can do when he's able to pressure that quarterback. Trying to earn more playing time even after Gregory comes back. Meanwhile, Indy starts from the 29-yard line. Got a flag, got a free play here, but still passes short and incomplete. Go to Mo'Ally Cox with a big day last Sunday against Tennessee, but tonight, haven't gone to him but once or twice. Six for 85 with two touchdowns. Defense, number 56. Five-yard penalty. First down. Just did a nice story on Baron Browning, and on cue, he jumps offside. There you go. Here we go. First and five. Mini Kibosh. Last week, Indy had 180 yards receiving by their tight ends. Cannot get them the ball tonight at all. And not a single catch tonight. Go figure. First and five. Pittman in motion. Lindsey. Uh-uh. And there's Mr. Browning again. Back to work. You just talked about the tight ends, Mo Alley-Cox, and the game that he had last week, and he's a big man, 6'5", 267. But watch this, Baron Browning. Looking back to the right, just careless with the football and just throws it up. Didn't even see Thomas, the rookie, out of Yale. And then after the interception, a big hit there by Zaire Franklin, just trying to block. And there goes Wilson into the tent. Into the medical tent. He had a right shoulder coming into the game. Tweaked last week. Here's the injury on Quidipe. Was their number one pick out of Michigan last year. Right away, as soon as he goes down, he's grabbing at the leg. And actually carting him off now. Boy, you just hate to see that. I mean, he's second year, you mentioned, out of Michigan. And starting to really come into his own. with the addition of Ngakwe on the other side. Wilson in there right now. The backup is Brett Rippon. Uncle Mark won a couple of rings and was Super Bowl MVP three decades ago with Washington. So after the pick from the 39, they start on the ground. A nice run here. Still chugging along. It picks up the first down to Deion Jackson. One more look at that hit on Wilson as we'll get a report on him shortly. We talked to him yesterday in our meeting and asked him how he was feeling because he's been a little bit banged up on that right shoulder. And right there, the block. Looks like it hits him right on that right side. And that was Zaire Franklin. Russell's a guy who's missed only three games in his ten seasons with the Seahawks. now from midfield Phillip Lindsey but a penalty at the 48 yard line flag thrown there offense number 63 10 yard penalty first down this is Danny Pinter take it over for Kelly in the middle of the line yeah right in the middle head up nose on him just tackles and brings him down Roussel's been pretty active has had some success in this game, shooting some gaps. And that time, it started to get leverage on Penner. And to prevent him from making that tackle, he just wraps up. But again, here's the Colts. Starting to get a little momentum, a few first downs, and then bang, backwards after a holding call, first and 20. Pass caught up at the 47-yard line. Another flag at the end of the play. It was holding by Lindsey. I think they'll get Alex Singleton there for the late hit. After the completed catch, personal foul. Unnecessary roughness, number 49 of the defense. 15-yard penalty and an automatic first down. He's down right there already. I mean, again, we always talk about this. It's not so much, I think fans are used to seeing a big hit that draws the attention and maybe an official throws the flag here. It's just that he was down, could have held himself up, and ends up hitting him when he's already been whistled down. Wilson is out of the tent. Looks for all the world while he's ready to come back in. 38-yard line here, first and 10. Two-yard pickup on the ground by Deion Jackson, who's carried 10 times for 37 yards. As ugly as this game has been. You think so? Yeah. It's 9-6, right? We're in the fourth quarter. Somebody's going to end up winning this game. They have to. Or tie. It could be a tie. I guess that's true. I apologize. Let just say somebody going to win this game No one going to look back at this It just going to be a check mark under the W column So you got 12 minutes to go And another loss behind the line of scrimmage. That time it's Singleton who created the personal foul a moment ago. Partially atones there. Loss of three. Third and eleven. Unaffiliated neurosurgeon checking out that the injury there they are just checking it out seeing what happened to Wilson he went to the tent comes out of the tent looks for all the world as it will come back in we'll see third and ten Ryan sacked 45 and that probably takes him out of field goal range even at altitude Barron your veteran under center as ugly as it's been tonight at least the experience he understands this situation better than anybody Ryan gets it away quickly and that is hold in Franco say Granson was out he had a free play he did for an offside here offside defense number 90 that 5 yard penalty Yeah, the play would have gained five, so he'll take the penalty. That five-yard penalty results in a first down. Now Benito's back in. Don't look now. I mean, no timeouts. 47 seconds. Veteran quarterback. Anything can happen here. Field goal, of course, sends us to OT. But they're moving the ball here. Ryan's thinking about, yeah, a field goal would be nice, but let's try to end this game. you better keep an eye on 14 and white he's had one of those nights Paul is placed back at the going back and forth here 33 yard line now you got Pat Sertan who they normally stay away from on Pierce I think he came into this game thinking he'd have to potentially shadow Michael Pittman. But after this game, in a way, it's gone. They're taking their top corner away from Pittman and maybe aligning him more with Pierce, the rookie. Going back to the previous play, which was a five-yard gain, and now they've got a first down for the moment. Looks like Brad Rogers is ready to tell us something. They're still in conference. And after all that, it's the first of 10 of 47 seconds. The ball is one more short to the line of the game. It's second down. That's what I thought. Wait a second. It can't be first down. It's second down. It's second down and one. All right. Can we get it right on the ground? Big hole. and now taking the ball to the 22-yard line goes Deion Jackson. Boy, they are spread all over the field thinking about pressuring Matt Ryan, but they're all over with all these receivers. Nobody left in the middle of that defense. From the 17, Ryan Jackson. Close to the first down, breaks away from Singleton. Second down, just a little short of the first. and Ryan's going to spike it. Time for another play. Oh, yeah. As long as you get out of bounds and go to the end zone. Yes. And then you kick the field goal. And what more could you ask for than overtime? What more? Tell me. Right. I think Matt Ryan, again, that experience, he's thinking about one or maybe two shots here, depending on the style of play, to be able to take shots into the end zone. Again, it hadn't been pretty, but it's a veteran quarterback that knows how to win in these situations. So third down, one. And now you've got a stoppage here. I think there's a little confusion as to what down it is. An APC spotter. Right. Benito's coming out of the game. So the word came down. Take him out. Kongbo comes back in. That word came from the sideline. Gives Reich a chance to talk to Ryan. Last thing in the world you want to take here is a sack. That's the last. That could run the clock out. Pearson Pippen get most of the attention but you go back to the Tennessee game last week especially in the red zone the size of these tight ends are a heck of a matchup tough matchup for a defense and he's down to the bottom the big tight end Jelani Woods matched up against Sertan oh my god he said wait a minute the play clock should have gone to 25 He said you didn't tell me You didn't tell me You talk about clock management The Zebras need a little bit of that too There's the play clock in the bottom right Wow man A couple of great plays on that last series And there he goes Shaking it off Both these teams Came in already bent up And then a lot of injuries tonight One of the good news for these teams is they get half of a bye week. Don't play again until the week from Sunday. Denver goes to the Chargers. And Indy goes against Jacksonville. And there goes Mike Boone. So on the ground, they're picking up chunks here for the 45 and a first down. Remember, Quidipe is out. Odangbo is in. and they are running on the right side, getting a great push again. Cam Fleming, see the tight end, Tomlinson, look at this push. We've not seen that this entire game. Melvin Gordon and Boone are looking at this like, thank goodness we finally have a little bit of wiggle room here to be able to get downhill. Again, without Javante Williams gone for the year. Knee surgery forthcoming. They're averaging four and a half yards per carry. Cutting it back. First down and more. 19-yard line goes Mike Boone of Carriquet. Makes the stop there. So they had four runs on this drive for 48 yards. That's a gain of 18 there. And this play is designed to go to the left. Boone with division. Our guy Kenton Fleming again on the right side. Keep in mind, he's a backside. This is a backside block. Play designed to go left. Great vision. Cut back. And then he bounces it way back to the right. with a little bit more room to that outside. I'll tell you what, man. Boom, boom, boom, boom. We've got four straight plays when they're running the ball. Averaging 12 yards per toe. And you've got a flag here. You've got Graham Lascaux. You can see him from the right side beginning to move to make it first down and 15. Offense, number 61. Five-yard penalty. First down. You know, you wonder with Boone in the game, Melvin Gordon in a three-point game late in the game like this with his fumble issues coming in. You go to Boone just to be safe. Ty Wheatley. Yeah, running back scopes. And a nice career. Person 15. Inside handoff here. Into about three or four from Mike Boone. clock under four minutes right now and where is this man they're getting a push now Garrett Bowles the left tackle is the man on the ground so often you see a guy getting rolled up is that the case here his right leg looks like it's underneath yeah Let's see if DeForest Buckner engaged with him in an injury timeout with 3.48 to go. Well, they've already lost their star running back, Williams. He's gone for the year. Bowles, well, we have no idea, you know, how long he'd be out, but never a good sign, obviously. He's in a lot of pain, a lot of frustration. Bringing the card out for the left tackle. The veteran, the anchor up there, the leader. They've already lost Tim Patrick, another leader of this team. These guys, not only these injuries, but you're talking about the true alphas of this franchise. You can see how frustrated he is. Calvin Anderson will come in to replace him. Meanwhile, we have a moment to look at the standings in the south. Jags are 2-2. So are the Titans. Indy, of course, is 1-2-1 coming in. Texans 0-3-1. AFC West KC 3-1. Their only loss was to Indianapolis. Right. Chargers and Denver 2-2. And the Raiders win the other day, so they go to 1-3. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? That. How did Mahomes? Right. Special teams. I know. I watched. But I'm just saying. Right. Exactly right. That's how crazy the league is. Kansas City goes to Indianapolis and should blow them out. Yeah. So Calvin Anderson, five starts in his career. Mike Boone is the running back. Second down and 12. Successful on the ground and take the ball to the 35. So they're clearly within McManus' field goal range. And Indianapolis will take its first timeout. This is the best push this offensive line has provided the entire night. So there it is. You came for some history tonight. We'll bring you some. The coin that we will use. This is tails. This is heads. What is your call? Tails is the call. It is tails. You win the toss. You want the ball. You want the ball. We're ready to like a kick. Kick this way. Alrighty. Colts will get it. Back with overtime after these messages. And the Colts will get the ball and begin their drive in overtime at the 25. Well, you go back to when we thought Denver Colts had used all their timeouts. Chances are you're just going to see them run the ball instead. They go for the jugular, and it backfires. Stephon Gilmore catches that late throw, gets underneath the route, and shows he still has it. You know, out on an island, no problem. cuts it, but a shocking play call there by Denver when you think all they had to do was run the ball work the clock and the game's over. From the 25 Ryan swings it out to Lindsey half a yard or so that's all. Second down. De'Amo Benito, they took him out of the game and now he's back in there. He's been in and out. That last drive when they ended up settling for a field goal, we finally saw more of Deion Jackson involved in the run game and also catching the ball out of the backfield. He's in there now. He's carried 12 times. Caught four. 12 for 53 on the ground. He flares out. Pass is caught. That's going to be a first down and a few yards more by Kylan Granson, the second year. Tight end out of SMU first down. Watched him play quite a bit in college at SMU. And undersized tight end, but a great athlete. I mean, he will make you miss out there just like that. You get a corner of safety. He's got good size. He can run over those defensive backs. Also, as you saw there, he can work around them. So positive yards there for Matt Ryan. up the middle another good run by the second year back out of Duke and these two guys have to fill in for one Jonathan Taylor Danny Penner who's been brought in for Ryan Kelly gets up to that second level picks up a nice block there double team works up to that works up to the linebacker helps secure the double team and then gets up there to Singleton getting a nice push haven't seen a lot of that one yard in the Broncos territory swings it to the outside caught there by Paris Campbell Campbell down the sideline and they're inside the 40 yard line great job Matt Ryan he's got a couple tight ends to the left looks like they're going to run the ball and again we saw this earlier from Russell Wilson here he just says get out of the run linemen don't even know it flip it out there now you've got a one on one with a really athletic, fast receiver in Paris Campbell. Make one guy miss, bang, he's down the sideline. From the 37. Ryan to the outside. That'll be in about four or five. Going to Michael Pittman. You know, one thing I wanted to mention earlier was Pittman Jr., His father, Super Bowl champ with Tampa Bay back in 0-2 when the Bucs beat the Raiders. His father in that game carried 29 times for 124 yards. People forget about that. Horcourts. Horcourts. Big guns. I remember him. What a great player. I'm sure he's proud of his son, Greary, out of USC. And now what he's doing with the Colts. Second and six. Again, just doing a lot of groundwork here. Phillip Lindsey. Big third down play coming up. Field goal extends the game. Touchdown ends the game. A little bit better job here of mixing in some different personnel groups. Good spacing with their passing game. And getting a much better push in the run. Now it's the money down, right? Now it comes down to can this line give Matt Ryan, who's been beaten up all night, give him enough time to make this throw. And you see Pierce there, who's had a big second half. See if they get him the ball. Ryan surveys. He's going to take off and not make it. To the 28 he goes. D.J. Jones makes the tackle. Six and a half to go, and it's fourth down. And you're with him right here. He's going to clear it. And then to the right of that, you'll see. I think he's a little late here. If he throws that earlier in front, he's got a chance. Now give Gilmore a lot of credit. for being able to get underneath that. You're talking about one of the better corners of all time in the NFL, but a ball that's thrown late and behind the receiver gives Gilmore a chance to cut it underneath and come up with that big interception to get Ryan the ball back. And Cortland Sutton came out of the game with what looked to be a groin issue just before that, so that's why Cleveland is in the game. From the 20. Ryan hit as he throws, and somehow, some way, that's fierce. Wow. He's had a couple catches tonight. You just kind of scratch your head wondering, how did he get it? First of all, the ball's tipped by Chubb. Yeah, Chubb got behind, knocked that ball loose. You're thinking it's an interception of anything, right? I mean, that ball goes into the air. Chubb knocks it loose. Somehow he gets enough on it. Mathis is on the other end of this. and you're thinking Mathis maybe comes up almost with like a fair catch interception but the rookie again with the length brings that ball in for a catch. Rookie against rookie that was Demarie Mathis and we got Darby is out. He's done for the night so Mathis seeing some extended playing time all to 31. Surprised there with Denver a little bit with the two minute warning timeouts I thought, work the clock, kick the field goal. Absolutely. I thought, if nothing else, get it for a first down, and then you run the clock out. If nothing else, you're working the clock, right? Right, I know. Really, the only thing that gives India a chance is what just unfolded with that interception. If Denver wins, they're going to have three wins, and they're about as ugly a trio of wins as you could possibly have. Only good handling with Houston. beat the 49ers by one when Garoppolo stepped out of the end zone and you tell me about tonight. Ryan, shoulder shake. Ball is out! And somehow gathering it in fortunately for them Matt Ryan Chubb came around when you're able to retain possession. So you think with Chubb rushing you've got a tight end and a running back don't you think you'd want to use a big lineman there? Instead they had the tight end Granson in the back, Jackson and he olays both of them to put pressure on Ryan second down and 11 Colts have no timeouts Ryan deep drop pressured again, throws and going to the ground and does he hold it in? He does Pierce a little under thrown, Pierce comes back makes the grab and for Pierce tonight, that's 7 catches for 75. And that's his third catch She put a little checkmark by an appreciation by Pierce. Again, having to adjust back to a ball. Matt Ryan, I don't even know how he got that ball off with Nick Benito coming down on him. Incredible effort by Ryan and also, again, the rookie Pierce. And rolls out of bounds to stop the clock. Over the middle. That is caught. That is Paris Campbell. He has a first down. Can they get into field goal range? and now time out oh there's an injured Bronco Nick Bonito yeah he's way back at the 33 yard line he ran into his own guy they're both trying to get to Matt Ryan they met behind Ryan on the pass rush he's trying to get in there he's trying to turn the corner and at the end of this once the ball's out bang A friendly fire, you know. Yeah. It's like, didn't that cost Shaq Leonard that knocked him out of the game last week? That's right. Boy, that was a vicious hit. Yeah, runs in his own guy. Here's Ryan. Holds the wrist. Jeez. Jeez. So Benito, for the moment, at least he gets up. That was the throw to Pierce where he got just enough on it where he came back that very next play to make another throw. So he's fighting through some pain himself in that throwing game. Both these courtrooms mentioned. Wilson's only missed three games in his career. Ryan's only missed a handful of games in his 14-year career. So Browning and Benito are both out. The two backers get a first down from the 43. Ryan fires caught. He loves his rookie, Pierce. Mathis makes the tackle clock now under a minute. This is where 15 really don't have to, again, account for Matt Ryan because he's just not a threat to run the ball. Linebackers are gone. They're in coverage. Nobody's open downfield. Eventually it's the DNs that collapse down to take him, keep him short of the first. 48-yard attempt. McLaughlin to give them the lead, but the game will still be extended. Kendall will get a shot with their possession. Falk to put it down. And the kick is right down the middle. So, field goal number 7, 5.50, remaining in overtime. What have you missed? Wilson, two picks, four sacks. Ryan, two picks, six sacks. No touchdowns in the game. Seven combined field goals. Just in case you're just streaming in. Yes. Should mention, as bad as these offenses have been, I think it'll play out. These are two pretty good defenses, too. Yes. I think it's a combination of bad offense against good defense. Hence, all the field goals that we have. 64 minutes of football and no touchdowns. Yeah. Good defense. Very good defense. Yeah. But it feels like it's been terrible offense, right? I mean, the booing. What do you mean it feels like? All right, Russ. Let's see what he's got. From the 25. Actually, 600 combined yards in the game. 306 for Indy and 305 for Denver. Wilson. Screen. Room for Gordon. Melvin Gordon to midfield before he is taken out of bounds. So they start with a screen pass here. And that takes it out to midfield on the game 23. Does a really good job of selling this. He's got tight ends both on this side and on that side. Looks downfield. Linebackers actually get depth. And then the linemen kind of were patient with it before they ended up getting out there. So a nice job of a combination of the play call there. but Russ in the line really sold that. Play action. Time. Wide open. Inside the 30 goes Jerry Judy to the 14-yard line. Rodgers makes the tackle. They're at the 14 with a first down and five minutes to go in OT. He gets lost here in this route. Now, Crosser was Sutton on one side. You see K.J. Hamler on the other. Nobody picks up Jerry Judy, who was in that condensed formation. And Russell Wilson, off the mat, back-to-back plays of selling one thing with his eyes, manipulating the coverage, and then throwing to an open receiver. Trying to do it again. In the red zone again, where they have a lot of problems. Here's Gordon. And he'll get wrestled back after a pickup of two. It'll be second down. When you see a lot of problems, talking about dead last in the NFL and scoring touchdowns in this region, and it has not been any better tonight. Two good plays. They get down and close to this goal line. Let's see if they can finish it off. 3 for 13 on the season inside the 20 Gilmore is on Sutton this time keep it on the ground and getting spilled just outside the 5 is Gordon by Rodney McLeod so 3rd and 2 at the 6 Grover Stewart just slides one way, takes himself out of the play, and Melvin Gordon goes up and over McLeod. And, most importantly, holds on to that football. So third and two. Clock rolling, 318, 317. Gordon resets on the right side. and he will get stopped by O'Karrick. So what do you want to do here? You've got a fourth and one. You're trying to extend the game. He looks like he's going for it. Yep. He's playing to win and they're going fast. They're playing to win and they're going fast. Well, they snap it is the question. I'm just trying to draw them off. Fourth and one. Double, double. It's been a game in which each starting quarterback had four or more Pro Bowl selections. Ryan and Wilson, of course. Neither team scored a touchdown. But there's plenty of time remaining. Oh, no, yeah. Yeah. So we may get history. Who would have thought that with the way this game? Tell me about it. It's going. Third down and eight from the 35-yard line. Complete. Making an easier field goal attempt. You have a Cortland Sutton's taken out of bounds. Fourth down. And with 3-10 left, you're thinking they stop him, and then they push him out of bounds. And now you're wondering, okay, are they going to go for this, or are you going to give the ball back to Matt Ryan after a field goal attempt? And he got fourth and two. With the way the Colts' offenses looked? Right. Why not, right? So the crowd likes the fact that the Broncos would at least line up to go for it. We'll see if they like it after the snap and completion of the play. Wilson fires over the middle. Yes, they do convert. First down, and that'll take more time off the clock. Saubert makes the catch there. So the tight end with his fifth catch of the game. Watch these two defenders react to Boone, who goes to the outside. And it just opens up the middle right there for a quick throw on fourth down and short. It was almost as if Denver knew that they were going to react like that to Boone. And what an easy conversion there on fourth and short. So here's Denver inside that red zone where they've been bad this year. To the outside goes the pass. And try to keep them in bounds. Gilmore does. Sutton makes the catch. And it's second down and five. He just aborts the play. Just flips it out there with soft coverage with Gilmore. stiff arm just throws Gilmore to the sideline but give five credit for holding on the timeout taking second timeout Indy down to the final they also get the two minute warning Ryan just hoping of getting another shot here good job by Russell Wilson that was a run play called he saw that Soft coverage and took the easy throw to Sutton. Picked up some positive yards on first down. Second and five at the 14. Round again. Third down. Boone. and Indianapolis will take its final timeout. So the upcoming schedule is now. Colts against Jacksonville at Tennessee against Washington at home. Broncos at the Chargers against the Jets here week seven and then the game at Jacksonville week eight in London. By the way, they signed Tavius Murray who, the former Raider and liking and Shane who's been around, not ready to play. He played Sunday, had a big day in London, flew back with the Saints, and they said, you're going to Denver. So seven times zones away, but he's not playing tonight. So he comes, he's not active tonight. He's been in a couple weeks, he just said. Right. Denver's going back to London. It's a heck of a travel. It's worse than my travel. No, it's not. Game day. Games all over the country. Suns playing football. I mean, it's crazy this week. There he is. We've seen him for a number of years. Had some fine seasons. Still in great shape. As you said, he had a big game. Led the Saints in rushing. Third down and four. Wilson to the end zone. And it's intercepted by Gilmore. Oh, man. I mean, this is one of those, you've got to be kidding me, intended for Tyree Cleveland, the guy they haven't even targeted one time tonight. And here comes Ryan with a chance to do something and get at least a tie if he can move down the field. He gets the ball back. Judy went underneath, took the defense. Now he's telling Matt Ryan. Matt Ryan had no idea that it was down to eight or nine seconds. So third down and six now. And Ryan throws and throws that one almost into the stands. Now the Cox is there, fourth and six. And McLaughlin comes in. Here's your holder. Hawk, 31-yard field goal. What can happen next? You tell me. A miss? I don't know. Anything. Denver timeout. Terry, what about that delay game? What did you see? So what happened now on that, it was an administrative stop to get the player out of the game. so the play clock was under 10 it was at 3 the play clock goes back to 10 not 25 so once he put the ball back in play he only had 10 seconds to get the snap off Matt Ryan, in that situation do you notify the quarterback before that happens? because he seems surprised that absolutely should have happened the referee should have gone to Matt and said there's only 10, get your play called and get up to the line 31 yard attempt to try to tie it. Hello again, everybody. Six field goals. 9-9. Reminds me of Herman Cain. Anyway. What was the last 9-9 game you called? Oh, Reds baseball? There's no way you've called a 9-9 game. Quarterback comparison. There it is right there. Four interceptions collectively. Sacks. Gosh. That's one to forget about for both these guys. The hurries, the hits, the sacks. Last 9-9 game is when the San Francisco Giants, the great Lon Simmons, who was also the announcer for the 49ers, said at the end of seven, it's Padres 9, Giants 9. Unfortunately, the Giants are playing in German. Anyway. They're leaving. The Broncos fans are bailing. They've had enough. It's 9-9. They're like, the heck with it. I'm out. Yep. I'm out of here. That's crazy. Sometimes you just got to beat the traffic. Okay. The heck with this. I've seen it now. Heading over to catch our lounge rack after the game. So the Broncos will have it at the 25. And we're going to head to overtime. Colts have already played an overtime game, which wound up in a tie against the Texans. I did say somebody has to win, and you said, no. Not necessarily. We could end up in a tie. What would Lee Corso have said? Not so fast, my friend. Correct. Odds are in favor at this point of a tie. There he goes. All right. So next thing that comes up will be heads or tails. I don't think I've ever seen it where the home field is booing that the game's going into overtime. They still have a chance to win this game. They do. There's a frustrated fan base. Very. So spoiled from the mid-80s with the early days of Elway all the way through with Peyton. I mean, it's like every year they're in the mix for the playoffs and a Super Bowl. Every year. Well, you think about Elway and Manning, and they share something in common. They both ended their careers with a Lombardi trophy and then rode off into a Rocky Mountain sunset. Nothing wrong with that. Gentlemen. We will play an overtime period of up to 10 minutes. Each team will have an opportunity to possess the ball, unless the team first is possessing scores a touchdown, or there's a safety score. At the end of 10 minutes, if there's not been a score, the game will be recorded as a tie. Each team will have two timeouts. All reviews will be upstairs, and fourth quarter timing rules will apply.
