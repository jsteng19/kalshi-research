 Like I said, Call of Duty coming out this weekend. How many kills you guys? Right. I bet he know that. I bet he know when a new map drops. That's a quarterback. Andy Dalton's the safer pick. And they're going with safe right now. They're going with step six. What does that tell you? Give him the ball. Five rushing touchdowns for him so far this year. We will see you guys at halftime. Al, Kirk, and Kaylee are next. Enjoy the game. The home of the Arizona Cardinals where Kyler Murray tries to get his team back on track, taking on Alvin Kamara and the New Orleans Saints. Impactful injuries. Connor, Brown, Pugh, Hudson, Gardek, Prater, the kicker, all out tonight. Meanwhile, no sympathy from the Saints. Their minus their own half dozen, Thomas and Landry and Pete. Troutman, Lattimore, that's huge. And Adebo, a starting corner. So with that short deck, maybe about 48-49 cards in it. Dennis Allen, first season as the Saints head coach. After Sean Payton stepped aside following 16 years at the helm. And in his fourth year in Arizona, Cliff Kingsbury. In the Arizona desert right now. See if he can turn it around. Visiting with him yesterday, you could feel that energy just talking to him. I think he's feeling the pressure short week. A lot of injuries. Obviously, Luke Hopkins coming back. Hopefully, he'll get their offense going and get Kyler Murray going. Talked about the injury to Prater. So, Rodrigo Blankenship, who started the season with Indianapolis. Shahid, whose first touch in the NFL last week was a 44-yard end around for a touchdown. He's back to receive the kickoff. Arizona won the toss and deferred. And the Saints will come out and take over at the 25-yard line with Andy Dalton. So Dalton, again, making another start here. Winston not quite ready to play. Three touchdowns, one pick. That rating is a little above the league average. He's going to play it a lot more conservatively than with Jameis Winston. Yeah, and I think he's taking care of the football. That's the biggest difference from where they were early in the year with Jameis and his three games. He had the five interceptions. It's a team that wants to run the ball, you know, set up play action. And tonight, try to be conservative and smart. Don't turn it over. Winston would be the emergency quarterback. If Dalton got hurt, they'd put Hill in the game. Next, they're going to see a lot of him in the quarterback anyway. Meanwhile, a six-yard gain starts things. Jawan Johnson, who will be the starting tight end tonight, because Adam Troutman is out. Gain of six there, second down and four. Johnson, a former receiver, started at Penn State, went over to Oregon, has moved now to tight end in the NFL. He gives you a really good tight end with a great catch radius and knows what to do with the ball in his hands. Kamara, the running back, bunch three receivers and then break that. Give it to Kamara. Big hole. He exploits it as he normally does. Good, tough running as he normally does. Out to the 50-yard line tackle there by Buda Baker. So off he goes for a gain of 18. Watch the push here from the middle and the right guard, Ruiz. Just kind of pushed this down. Nice, good vision on the backside. You even saw the block there by Smith-10. Just kind of sealed it and opened it up. If you're a Saints fan, how nice is it to see Alvin Kamara with room to run sets up, again, every aspect of what they want to do with this offense. Give it to him again. A little bit of traffic here. And gets the ball into Arizona territory to the 48-yard line. Lawrence makes the stop. There's Vance Joseph. He's done a very nice job as the Cardinals' defensive coordinator this season. Two years as the head coach at Denver. And then came here. And there's an opportunity, I think, down the line. Maybe he's been interviewed for head coaching positions and could get the top job somewhere again. I agree with you. And he's a very aggressive reputation. Of course, came up with Wade Phillips. Spent some time with Marvin Lewis. Loves to attack. We'll hear from Jerome Bolger. For the first time tonight. Offense, number 71. Five-yard penalty. Still sucking down. Ryan Ramchick, the right tackle. Badger against Badger. Two great ones. Ramchick against J.J. Watt. Pretty familiar with each other. And, you know, just when this offense, exactly what they wanted. Some rhythm, running the football, a little setback here. See if they can overcome that and pick up the first down. Mark Ingram is the running back on second and 11. Play action. Bolton hangs in the pocket. Bolton going for it. And all flows caught. Coach in the league over that period of time. And yet this season, Kamara does not have a touchdown. But it's Thursday night, so we'll get him into the end zone. We're going to get him in there tonight. He's 27 years old, six years. Sometimes you see these backs that are so good, they start to drop off. I don't think that's the case at all with Kamara. He just needs some help, and I think he's starting to get it. He looks good so far early. And a great receiver as well. Oh, yeah. You've got Dwayne Washington in the backfield now. Direct snap is taken by Taysom Hill, and he comes close to picking up the first down. So they had Washington in. They had Hill in there as well, changing it up in the backfield. We'll see if he picked up the first or not. Vance Joseph defense they told us when seven's in instantly IDing him not just a quarterback anywhere he might be lined up just a quarterback power you know it's a numbers advantage with Hill in there remember he can throw the ball he threw the ball for quite a few yards when he was at BYU he knows how to throw it third and one put a full back in the game Kamara the running back give it to the up back and taking it to the 50 in forward progress should get Ingram, who had lined up as the up back a first down, and it does. It was such a wrinkle for this offense, because like right now, he's in there with Andy Dalton. You never know when the potential of what he might do, and Pete Carmichael does a fantastic job of utilizing him with his skill set, now all the way at the bottom of the screen. Now Hill is in the game, but this time he lines up as a wide out. He's at the bottom. Snap and a whistle before the snap. Foster. Offense, number 76. Five-yard penalty. Still first down. That is Calvin Throckmorton. Take a look at... With Hill. 200 pass attempts, 200 carries, 30 catches, NFL history. Those names, first of all, they go all the way back except for Cordell Stewart. to before the 1955 season. We'll talk about Charlie Trippi later. Incredible. And Cordell Stewart, he was the guy. Remember, they called him Slash. But this guy is Slash Plus. Listed as a tight end, but plays all over the place. And the catch is made here. To the 45-yard line goes Olave. As we reach the halfway mark and beyond in the first quarter. Meanwhile, you've got Marco Wilson, the corner. Who's down on one knee with Hill back on the bench here it'll be second down at five Well they work on him and Cheever's stacked to the right you got Hill throwing it to Kamara with some blocking very nicely designed play And that will net a first down David Collins makes the tackle out there Now, Taysom Hill can run this. If the defense aligns in a certain way, they're going to be way out to the receivers. He'll run. It's a power play that's called. Instead, the Cardinals don't adjust to that stacked look, so he just flips it out there with two blockers in front of Kamara. So another well-designed play and a nice wrinkle there with Hill to give him that option. You think a conga line out there at the 38-yard line. All handed on and stuffed in the backfield last time as Kamara. Tackle is made there by Zach Allen. Number 94 having a very good season. I don't want to jinx him, but Andy Dalton signed with the Saints to be the backup to Jameis Winston. Jameis Winston gets hurt, has the interceptions, comes in. And it's almost like he has just settled this offense down. It's a calming presence that you sense watching him execute. You're seeing it again tonight for the fourth straight week. Offense has not been the issue for these guys the last couple of weeks. Second down and 12. Go up and look out. Gets hit as he throws, but gets it away and it's caught. And a short game here by Ingram. J.J. Watt almost getting to Andy for the sack. Third and nine. Boy, he was so close. One-on-one with Hurst. Blindside of Dalton. And again, Dalton kind of sensing this, that internal clock. He knows 99's close to him. These guys go all the way back to playing in a Rose Bowl game, TCU, Wisconsin. And they played so often in the NFL, the Texans and the Bengals. So I think he knows when 99's getting close. third down nine four man rush Dalton fires, finds the open man the open space, it's Olave again having a heck of a series here, Olave has now caught three for 40 yards another third down and a good job of protecting Andy Dalton on this third down, sometimes he'll give you exotics It's only rushed four. But look at that. Just find the soft spot. Dalton throws him in to that hole in the zone. And I'll tell you, for a young receiver, it's nice to see Dalton and Alave, who missed last week, in such rhythm, only playing a few games together. Saints, three out of three on third down. First and ten here. Kamara's back in. Alvin. Off he goes again. and that's an 11-yard pickup for Kamara to the 11-yard line. They just put Lewis Kidd in the game in place of Brock Morton, and he led the way with a block. Yeah, nice double team in the middle with McCoy the center, Ruiz the right guard. Watch how they work in sync and then climb up to that second level. Beautiful work by the big offensive line. It's hard to single out one guy on this Saints offensive line. It's refreshing to see five guys working as one is the backup guard who's starting tonight. Brock Morton's on the sideline. Right. That was Kidd who came in, helping to lead the way. Meanwhile, he got Kamara inside the 10-yard line. Alvin to the 7. So this drive right now, you've got 13 plays having been run. Talk about balance, 7 runs, 6 passes, and a second down and 6. Doug Marone, the offensive line coach, just has these guys working. You know, our first five, six weeks, we've seen offensive line play. We've had some injuries, and it's like they're still trying to build the continuity. This one really stands out because of how they work together. Most teams having problems. It starts up front. No doubt. With makeshift offensive lines. A whole bunch of teams you can ask about. That second and six. And in the backfield coming through, Buda Baker. Fuda Baker who's been a key factor, a star ever since his rookie season, now in his sixth year out of Washington. This is one way to slow down an offensive line. You outnumber him and then you have one of the best safeties in run support in the National Football League come up and take Kamara out before he can even have a chance. Boy, he's fun to watch and he's all over the field for this defense, the heart and soul. This drive has consumed over eight and a half minutes. This is play number 15 on the third and eight. Rush four. Dalton. Picked off in the back of the end zone by Antonio Hamilton, who takes a knee. So the Saints run 15 plays in almost nine minutes. and come up with Zilch. Hamilton made the pick. This guy's bounced around seven years in the league. This is his 77th game. That was his first interception. This is a guy who got burned in a grease fire in his kitchen, missed the first four games of the season, came back and was playing in his third game, and makes the pick here after a 15-play drive. He's faced a lot of adversity and overcome it, put himself in a position. We've been bragging about Andy Dalton, his decision-making, and here it's a poor decision on third down. Tries to force it, gets a little greedy, tight coverage there, even with the safety coming over. Great job by Hamilton undercutting that. The only thing he could do there is check it down to a lobby in the right flat. Now Murray and company. Tyler keeps it himself. Off he goes for a gain of 18 before he steps out of bounds. Beecham throwing a block to spring him first down. That's the challenge with Cliff Kingsbury's offense. They spread you all over the field, sideline to sideline, create a lot of space, and then you also have to worry about the quarterback, obviously, in the design run game, especially with a big right tackle out in front of him. From the 37 on first down. Blitz coming, running right through the middle Eno Benjamin Inside the 30 Forced out of bounds at the 20 yard line By Ty Matthew So Benjamin With their top two running backs out He gets the start And off he goes for 45 The trips to the right Creates a lot of attention from the defense Watch the left tackle Humphreys times it up perfectly and good patience by Benjamin. You know, they're down to backs because of the injuries to Connor and Darrell Williams, but Benjamin has great quickness and showed patience that time before he explodes through that hole. Benjamin, who'd be third on the depth chart were it not for the injuries. Here goes Murray, and he has to settle for a one-yard gain, second and long. This is where they need to execute better. You know, the first couple weeks of the season, flawless. Six of seven in this area in the red zone with touchdowns. In the last four weeks, three of 11 when they have gotten down in this area. So with Hopkins back, how much better will this be? Because if they're going to win tonight, they're going to have to score touchdowns. Obviously, they can't settle for field goals. It was a disaster last week. or block punts recovered in the end zone for touchdowns, which was their only touchdown last week at Seattle. Keanthe Ingram is now in the game at running back. He flares out. He takes the toss, and he gets tackled at about the line of scrimmage by Pete Werner, and that takes us to the second quarter. After one in Arizona, Saints 7, cards 3. Back after these. Miss ago, he said we need completions. It's third and 10, and Robbie Anderson just picked up from Carolina. Carolina in the game to the right side on a third and ten. Murray in the pocket. Blush him out. He'll keep it. Tyler Murray sets up a first and goal. So dangerous. I mean, you think you get him, you're not even close. And the underneath coverage locks up with the running backs and tight ends. And if you don't get to him with that front, then he's going to have running lanes. Little twists up front. and if you don't get him and you're not able to corral him on third down, especially linebackers are on these running backs, give him way too much room to be a threat, and they pick up that first down. Can anything frustrate a defense more than that? That's it right there. 11 yards on the third and 10. First and goal now with a seven-yard line. Benjamin is the back. Not for long. Pete Werner right there. Werner in his second year out of Ohio State. Kind of an unsung guy having that kind of a year. Yeah, second year. It's like he's taken that big step. The light's gone off. Replacing Quan Alexander in this defense. And watch how he not only is able to shoot a gap, watch him bounce off of a tight end block there and still be able to get into that backfield. You know, he is a big athletic guy. Did a lot at Ohio State in college. They asked him to play out on the spot, play in the box. So he's got great versatility, just kind of coming into his own now in this Dennis Allen defense in year two. On a second and goal from the 10, and Kyle Lamar looked at that defense and decided he was going to take the timeout. Timeout, Arizona. Arizona, three points in the first quarter, equaling their total first quarter points over the first six games. this team has been playing from behind all season I mean this is almost unbelievable when you look at it entering tonight the Cardinals when trailing have run 346 plays by far the most in the league when leading they have run down, down, down we go where it stops nobody knows 13 plays all season long in 6 games plus 1 quarter I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like that including Cliff Kingsbury And, again, tonight down 7-3, see what they can do with this red zone opportunity. But, again, they're trying to dig themselves out and try to regain the lead. Second down and goal. Murray hangs in there incomplete at the six-yard line. Benjamin could not hold on. And we go to third down and goal. Saints doing a good job of taking care of their corners. Bradley Roby, who came in tonight for Marshawn Lattimore, he's out of the game. So you're dealing with a lot of backups back there. And so far, the rookie, Taylor, has held up very well. Harris on the other side, who has been a practice squad guy until last week, a veteran. Yeah, Christian, his 12th year, been around a long time. Trying to lend some stability to that secondary, which is a mess right now. A little locked into the end zone. That's Moore. Can he hold on to the bat? He's juggling in the end zone. A flag is thrown on the play on top of everything in the end zone. So that's Rondell Moore, who's 5'7". Did a lot of stuff at Purdue. You've got Elante Taylor who's been all over the place. Bring it down. Pretty tight defense there by Murphy, 7. As Kingsbury yesterday his best players first guy he mentioned was Murphy Lutz With the field State Farm Stadium good thing about playing in this climate is you can open up the roof a lot Some of the stadiums their track will loose someone's always closed That the roof was open for the last Super Bowl that was played here back in 2014 between Seattle and New England in February Beautiful day and night. Likewise tonight to the end zone and to the 25-yard line. Kirk. Let's go inside the game presented by Burger King. Let's talk about the Cardinals' offensive line. We knew the Saints would sit back and force them to be patient. So you've seen a lot of pullers up front. Garcia, who's out of the game now, left tackle. Humphreys has been doing a really good job. You know, they're averaging six yards a carry. That's what they had to do against the approach from the Saints' defense concerned about giving the potential big play in the pass game. They knew they might have to be patient, run, and throw the ball underneath that coverage. Start from the 25. On the ground here. In of a yard for Eno Benjamin. Second down and nine. Showing that offensive line. That is not an area, since Cliff Kingsbury has been here, you would look at as a strength. And when the injuries up front, Hudson, the center, the leader, the alpha, this offensive line, Pugh out, the left guard, his backup, Max Garcia out, Cody Ford in. Like so many teams around this league, it's been musical chairs up front. But tonight, so far, doing a pretty good job. Billy Price in his first action of the season, the center. Number one pick of Cincinnati back in 18, playing with the Giants last year. and that is knocked down at the line of scrimmage. Murray at 5'10", he's trying to reach up as high as he can and get it over the top. It's third down and nine. And, of course, that's the concern up front. Looked like 91 Street got his left hand on the ball to knock that away. Saints defense, again, gets the Cardinals to a third down to try to get off the field. Reset the play clock. And it's either going to be third and 14 or third and four. You just mentioned Billy Price. I think he started to fall back before he snapped the ball and lost his footing. Ball start. Offense, number 53. Five-yard penalty. There's always a kibosh. You mentioned the guy's name. You're talking about a great job he's doing. There you go. Think about his run that he's been on since 20. In 2020, he's with Cincinnati. Goes to the Giants. Ends up starting a bunch of games last year. He's at Las Vegas. And now here in Arizona, he's on a practice squad just two weeks ago, and now he's starting. That was the Cardinals' first penalty tonight. Saints have been flagged five times. Third and 14. Murray protected well. but everybody's covered and he goes down big sack back at the 11 yard line granderson and jordan are both there fourth down fourth and 23 now the right tackle beecham does his job up front trying to keep cam jordan out that is a coverage sack you rush four you got seven in coverage they took everything away downfield and eventually Jordan in that front is able to get to Murray, push him way back. Cards back to back, three and outs. Andy Lee, his last punt was 31 yards. This one is a whole lot better. 32-yard line, going to run it back from there. Shahid. Inching ever closer to midnight. It's completely over the moon right now. dialed in this week probably waiting for that information. Oh, yeah. Nobody more popular among the teenage girl group than Taylor Swift. Big as it gets. Fantastic performer, too. Worldwide. Oh, yeah. Appreciate her everywhere. Well, the Saints defense did their job. Got the ball back, got a field goal. Got the ball back again, close to midfield. Giving Andy Dalton this offense a chance to get right back in this game. Back-to-back three and a half. So at the 46-yard line, they start this drive. Ready. Let's go. Plays tonight. The rookie out of Tennessee. Covering. And we'll get the goal from Boger. Offense. Number four. That penalty declined. The result of the play. Fourth down. and got him at the top of the route with a little push-off with the left arm. Taylor, in fact, as soon as he got up, raised his arms to say, hey, he pushed off. I need to call, and he got it. He did. Moore juggled it anyway before he stayed in. So here comes Blankenship now. Made a 50-yarder. And this one from 28. Andy Lee, the punter, to hold it. And Blankenship is 2-4-2. But the Cardinals still don't have a lead. Yeah. They'd go with the fade. You'd think they would want to get it to the bigger receiver. There's the push right there. Good call by the official. Year old stomping grounds back in the day, right? Many, yeah. Arizona State years. Let's go with Charlie Taylor in the Hall of Fame, of course. Fantastic. He's a great running back. Reggie Jackson was there at that time. Wow. He's a pretty good baseball player. Oh, yeah, of course. How good was he in college? You know what? He also played football, and he was a pretty good cornerback. Built like a football player. Oh, yeah. Forget about baseball. Reggie might have been able to play in the NFL at some point. Of course, Barry Bonds wasn't bad. Not too terrible. Rick Monday, Sal Bando, off we go. And we'll start from the 25-yard line. Back to the last play. Yeah, just something to keep an eye on. Remember, New Hopkins is one of the best receivers in the league, but still working his way back. Third year in the system, crucial third down. They need a touchdown in the red zone. And he looks over to Kyler Murray like, hey, I don't know if I got the call. I'm not sure what's going on here. And it forces Murray to have to work the other side and make an adjustment to try to get the ball to Moore. So something to watch, just that rhythm and continuity. You can see him communicating there to try to work things out. Sooner or later. Ingram is the running back. As Hill in the game sets up on the wing. With a space there in a five-yard pickup. Taking a second down and five. This offense has been in sync for the most part, other than the mistake by Andy Dalton the last time they were out with the interception. but their plan tonight, like it always has been, going back to the Drew Brees era and Sean Payton, run the football, play action, ball out quickly, screen game, and you got Dalton up to the top and Payson Hill in here. Hill will take the snap and run it. Sean Payton is in the house somewhere, too. That's Hill all the way to the left. Dalton looking short, throwing, caught. That is Kevin White. White with a lot of room to roam down the sideline. Did he step out or not? And he takes it all the way inside the five. And the officials are running down there with him before Hamilton makes a stop. So he tightropes the sideline and sets up a first down and goal on a gain of 64. What a great job by White here on third down against Hamilton, who had the big interception. Look at that separation. Just a shallow cross. And then the speed by the former first-rounder out of West Virginia to run away from people. Make sure he stayed in. Here's the look right here. So far, so good. He's in balance. That's good. What a play. A little bit of green there. And Arizona maybe wanting to challenge this. Well, there it is. That angle a little bit different. I think this is the look. Like you said, it looks like there's a little green right there. It sounds in the water field that the runner did not step out of bounds. Terry McCauley looking on. What do you think? See, well, Terry, I want you to rehearse your lines here. We'll go to a commercial, then you tell us what you think. The KFC just combined spikes. And it is not reversed, so Arizona challenged, but right there is the evidence, Your Honor. And it's a 64-yard game for a guy who at one point was the number seven overall pick in the draft by the Chicago Bears. And looked at, for the most part of his entire career, as a bust. Just never lived up to the hype. In fact, he's been on the practice squad all year. He was active last week. Back to the practice squad again. Gets activated today. Doesn't have a catch on the year. How happy is he? Bears fans are saying, where were you when we needed you? Right. But it just goes to show you, with Michael Thomas and Jarvis Landry down, others have had to step up, and they have. First and goal now from the three-yard line. Tamara in the backfield. Taken down, line of scrimmage. J.J. Watt in his 12th season in the league. And what a career he has had. Though it's been beset by a lot of injuries in recent times. Physical, still explosive. Able to, especially down in this area. You better get down into the inside gaps. Because he knows how to shoot them as well as anybody. Second and goal. Ten and a half to go. Two halftime. Caught by Hill, and he will barrel his way into the end zone. Dalton to Hill. In for the score. They go five plays, 75 yards. Of course, the big 64-yarder to White. And the Saints up 13-6 with the extra point coming. What a play call by, again, Pete Carmichael. has Jawan Johnson out there, Traquan Smith, who's 6'2", 210 as a receiver, an outstanding blocker in front of Taysom Hill. Lutz for the point after. I tell you, Carmichael in his 14th season as the Saints offensive coordinator, all under Sean Payton, going a heck of a game tonight. And, you know, it's three on three to the outside, right? So you're going to move Hill over here, and you've got to get a couple blocks, right? Once Hill goes into motion, they're going to run with him, kind of move to the outside. Now you're asking Hill out here to beat Murphy one-on-one after the catch. Two inside guys make their blocks. Now the physicality of Hill after the catch lowers his shoulder, and a good job by Dalton getting it out quickly and accurately to give Hill a chance. 225 yards already for New Orleans. 113 for Arizona. I keep thinking about that old, you know, Vince Lombardi film where he's on the sidelines saying, what the hell's going on out there? What's going on out there? Yeah. It's nice to see offense for our production. This is a lot of fun. 14-6. So the Cardinals trailing by eight. We'll get the ball at the 25-yard line. Kaylee, what you got? Al, you guys broke down the numbers behind Taysom Hill's productivity this season. He's been doing all of that with a really painful injury. He cracked two ribs and displaced another in training camp. Then week two against Tampa Bay, he cracked one of those ribs again in a different place. He told me he's been getting numbing medicine in his ribs before the last few games, and he did it again tonight. But barreling into that end zone doesn't seem to be bothering him. Man, oh, man. I mean, what he does. What else can you add to the story? He had a couple of cracked ribs. He sells beignets after the game in New Orleans as well. First out from the 25-yard line. Murray, that time out of the pistol. And Keontae Ingram going nowhere. Second and long. So many injuries to the Saints. Corners with Debo out and Lattimore out. and Elante Taylor, there he is. So the rookies had a big part. Harris has been around a long time, long time. Bronco is with the Chargers. And then Justin Evans is seeing some action. JT Gray has been in there as well. Second and ten. Murray. Goes over the top. Off to the races goes Deontay Ingram. Breaking tackles. and takes it to midfield before he is slung down at the 50-yard line by Carl Granderson. And because of what we're talking about, you've got two safeties back there to avoid the shots downfield against those corners. So what does Murray have to do? Run the ball, which we saw in the last possession, and throw underneath and get yards after the catch. That's what you have to do. And Ingram, a powerful guy, he makes Evans miss. Remember, the Saints had tough time tackling. Cincinnati last week, especially Jamar Chase, and it shows up there on that play. Ingram, six-round pick, started at Texas, finished his college career at Southern California, first and ten from the 49 line trying to get around the outside and enough to take the ball into Saints territory for a gain of about three is you know Benjamin That is eight. To the end zone. Get behind that left side, Al. 13 plays, 75 yards, go. Get behind Cody Ford. You just heard Kaylee talk about how he has come in for Garcia. Good job here. Watch him take Pete Werner right there. Push him to the inside. Humphrey's another good block. and it opens it up nicely for Ingram, who has power to run through those arm tackles. Well, they're going to go for two. Analytic Schmanalynix. I don't know what it says, but, you know, you go with your gut, and this is what Kingsbury's doing right now. Two-point try to try to tie the game. Murray. Looks like it might have been tipped, but a flag comes in here. Hopkins. Was it tipped? Tuttle says yes. Tuttle got his hand on the ball. Prior to the pass, holding. Defense, number 19. Half the distance of the goal. Replayed a try. That's on Harris. It's a tough ask for Harris to be out there by himself. He's talking about the tip. The call was before the ball was thrown. Exactly. Terry, just briefly, that's the call, right? Absolutely. Defensive holding, the tip doesn't matter. It's still a foul. Exactly. And now you have Moore at the bottom against Harris. Now you've got Corey Clement in the game, the former Eagle. Now you've got Murray, for the first time tonight, taking a snap under center. And he's going to hand the ball off. And trying to get into the end zone. The ball came out. And they're going to say that Benjamin did score. So the officials come in. They'll take another look at this. Obviously the scoring play. And Benjamin, for the moment, is in there to tie the game. At 14 with 2.28 to go. In the hand. Two-point try is good. It was close. There's Benjamin. Take another look here. And does he have control of the ball right there? He has control of the ball, but coming in right there was Roach. Malcolm Roach. It's his leg, right? Boy, that's close. That is. Terry, what do you think? Al, it would have to be clear and obvious that he loses control before the ball breaks the plane. It's not clear and obvious. It's incredibly tight. This one should stand. And it's one of those calls on the field. After review, the rule on the field stands. Two-point try to do it. Okay. Getting all situated. Look at Sherm. Messing around. Oh, man. All right, Andy Dalton. Let's see what he has with .228 to go. All right, to the 25 they come. Terry, come on in. Al, on this play, there was one other aspect. We have an illegal low block by number 23, the running back. We see the box. He can't block low outside that box. And we see he clearly goes low on the defender right there. That should have been a foul and a 15-yard penalty and takes away the score. And the interesting thing is that was Clements' first play tonight. He was in for one play, the two-point conversion. The former Philadelphia Eagle gets away with one from the 25-yard line. begin this drive Kamara to the outside breaks a tackle and another and another and comes close to picking up a first down to Ruiz the right guard is having a night for this offense up front third year, first couple years just kind of finding his way in this offense and this year it just seems that he's gone to a whole different level becoming one of the anchors up front along with Eric McQuaid for that one. So a good first 28 minutes tonight. 28 points. As we come back at the 35-yard line, first and 10 for the Saints. Golden underneath, and he's tipped. An interception. and all the way inside Shahid for the touchdown How about this guy last week makes his debut with a 44 yard sweep now he catches a 53 yard touchdown pass 2 minutes and 7 seconds into the game You're going to have a crosser right here watch how the safety opens up the middle He goes with a lave heck of a throw by Andy Dalton gets back, puts it out in front of Rasheed where he can run underneath it and he pulls away from Marco Wilson in one-on-one coverage. Gets the safety out of the way. Really well-designed play by Pete Carmichael and a heck of a throw by Andy Dalton. Will Lutz tacks on the extra point. So the Saints who have not been getting off the good starts, neither of the Cardinals, red hot at the outset tonight. Dalton to Shahid for the touchdown. This coming February. It's only their second touchdown in their last 24 opening drives. First, this season, as we talked about, slow starts. And Arizona, as Kirk mentioned at the top, outscored 41-3. Now 48-3 in the first quarter of the season. Yeah, it'd be interesting to see how they respond. This is a team offensively that's felt pressure because of the hold they've dug themselves into. Now they're down seven. Lutz's kickoff. into the end zone. So, Connor Murray, number one pick four years ago, comes out. Very uneven, inconsistent start for him this season. Total TDs, rushing and passing eight. Four picks. The rating is below the league average. And he's got to get it going. He's the first guy that says, hey, we have to find consistency. Coach Cliff Kingsbury says we have to stay on schedule, meaning they can't get into those third and tens. Eno Benjamin is the running back. He takes it. Played as college floor at Arizona State. Down the road. Gets seven off a block that time from D.J. Humphreys. You know, with Murray, I think it's just a matter of letting it rip. You know, he's going to eventually, such a playmaker, he's eventually going to find it. But early in this year, he's just holding on to the ball a little bit too long in a lot of throws. Up tempo, no huddle. Under pressure. Scrambled. She can do that extremely well. Throws on the run. And that's caught. And into Saints territory goes Rondale Moore. So Moore tackled there by Taylor. Off and running for 30. Is this Thursday night football? I know what's happening here. And Moore is a guy that I think college football fans are waiting to explode. Went to Purdue. Very elusive. Very powerful. Good job of keeping this play alive. Stays in sync with Moore. And Moore really reminded me of a Jalen Waddle type. but even stronger in his lower half, like a 500-pound squat kind of guy. But he's had a lot of injuries. They haven't been able to get him going, and that is a heck of a way to start this game for number four. Folks, the law of averages is kicking in. No more seven to three games for you. Right. We pray. Murray sidearms it. Falling down was Benjamin starting to fall down. Here's a flag coming in. Benjamin gets just about back to the line of scrimmage. Cold being made by Jerome Boger. Billy Price making his first start. He knows we'll play a downfield. Offense, number 76. Actually, Hernandez is the right guard. That penalty is declined. Second down. Cliff Kingsbury, he calls the plays. Brought to Arizona, the offensive guru. Great success in college. Coach Pat Mahomes, you may have heard of him. At Texas Tech. Got them to the playoffs last year. They were 7-0 at the start last year, but faded down the stretch. Went to the wild card game. Lost to the Rams. Second and ten. Murray fires. Caught. Just shy of the 30-yard line. That's DeAndre Hopkins. So Hopkins makes his first dash since last season. And the crowd salutes him. Just his presence. They only had a couple walkthroughs this week, but he's not been able to practice with that suspension. And as they said, just seeing him out at practice has lifted the spirits up of their offense. And they're hoping he can do more than provide a spark tonight to get this offense going. On third and five, Murray down the sideline. A lot of hand fighting going on here. Looking for a flag. There is none. That's Alante Taylor, a rookie, back there with Hopkins. You got the rookie on a guy who is on his way maybe to the Hall of Fame. And now, and now, nope, still no flag. You're talking about a guy, as you say, is a rookie, but a ton of confidence. Back to the 47, third and 10. Callaway's had quite a sequence over the last minute or so. Third and 10. Dalton steps up. Picked off at the 40-yard line. Isaiah Simmons. Simmons down the sideline. Simmons inbound. Simmons all the way. They may say with Cameron Thomas putting the heat on, they may put him out outside the five. There's an official standing back there. We're going to gather and talk about it, but for the moment there's a lot of celebrating going on. Simmons taking it all the way with 46 seconds. That'll go as a 56-yard interception return. Dalton has now thrown three picks tonight. And they're going to go for two. Simmons their first pick out of Clemson back in 2020. A look of astonishment on the faces of nearly everybody on that Saints sideline. And the two-point try right here. Murray threads it irks got it what a change of events last couple possessions Andy Dalton trying to get the ball to Olave right here watch the pressure that comes from the left side here that affects Andy Dalton the rookie Cameron Thomas beats the left guard hits him right there and he just doesn't see Isaiah Simmons, who's just reading his eyes, sitting back in coverage. Now he gets hit. Maybe he would have been able to get it over top of Isaiah Simmons. But that's a combination by the rookie Thomas getting in and then Isaiah Simmons cleaning it up and showing you what he could do with the ball in his hands after he comes up with that interception. Come out with a two-point play. I think he knew exactly where he wanted to go with the ball. How about the location by Kyler Murray getting it in to Zach Ertz? Low and away, away from that defender where Ertz can make the play in the two points. And Arizona's going to get the ball to start the second half. Coming out of the end zone. Rasheed Shahid, and then he falls down. So Shahid has had the two spectacular plays over the last two weeks The run last week, the catch tonight Got done in, flag is thrown On top of it all That flag came in late There's a couple players going at each other Near the Saints sideline Looked like Dwayne Washington from the Saints it's hard to read these Cardinals numbers after the play is over first foul, unnecessary eruptions receiving team, number 24 after the differences are gone first foul Dwayne Washington it's frustrating especially when the play is over you can see The receiver, the return man, is done. And then after the whistle, that push right there. Then he grabs the face mask as well. I mean, you go from a 14-14 game and a couple interceptions, and look at this. Well, initially you want to at least try to get into field goal range, but now they're pushed back inside the 10, and they're just going to say to heck with it. We'll go to the locker room. crowd started to boo I think they won another interception they won't get their wish but they've got enough so Dennis Allen his team had a 14-6 lead and 22 unanswered points by the Arizona Cardinals Cards get the ball to start the third huge story tonight that Adebo comes in not playing Lattimore comes in not playing. You talked about Robey, Al. So you take your top three corners out. Chris Harris is a veteran and has played a lot of great football, but he's a guy that's been on the practice squad for most of this year, and there he is starting with a rookie on the other side. That's why they're forced to take care of him with the safeties behind. Deep drop, second and seven to the outside. Open, making the grab there is Hopkins. So they get him involved here. He beats Justin Evans as he turns it to the outside. and that's a gain of 18 to the New Orleans 30. That's a great job by Cliff Kingsbury. Motioning. See, Taylor 27 was on him. Bring him to the inside. Now it's a mismatch against Justin Evans. Look at that separation. If he stays wide, he's dealing with Taylor who's equipped to stay with him with a 4-3-40. Motion him inside. Create a matchup against that nickelback and you can win it every time. Caught a couple. Murray is 6 of 9 for 77. Less than eight to play in the first half. To the outside, but nothing happening there. Goes Keontae Ingram. Cam Jordan trying to burnish what will be a Hall of Fame resume in his 12th season. How big is he in physical, able to get upfield against Bicham, forces the ball to go back to the inside. And on the other side, Davenport kind of cleans it up right there, the tandem. great job the one arm keep that outside shoulder and hand free and then collapse down on it he's known as a great pass rusher but over his career great against the run pass here nothing happening a bunch of swarming there I think the best story about Jordan he gets drafted by New Orleans and then Cleveland drafts Jordan Cameron same year in the fourth round And the Cleveland PR department called this Jordan. Jordan. Right. They called Cameron Jordan. They get Jordan. And now after 12 years, we all know. I think so. We got it figured out. Third and ten. Murray, look out. Down he goes. Pressure coming up the middle. He got a flag on it. David Onyemada is the first die in there, and Jerome Boger will tell us the rest of the story. Cardinals are indicating it's against the Saints. Holding. Defense. Number 30. Five-yard penalty. Automatic. First down. Justin Evans. Remember, he got matched up against New Hopkins earlier and got beat. Here he is again, one-on-one, and a big third down with that pressure from Davis to linebacker. He just tackles him at the line of scrimmage. That's one way to stop Newt Hopkins. Just tackle him. Don't let him run his route. So first down at the 25-yard line. More in motion. To the outside. Trying to spring free. And picking up six yards goes to Andre Hopkins. covered there by Chris Harris. This feels like they're just starting to find their rhythm. Remember, they have not thrown the football together, practiced all year because of the suspension, trying to work with him this year. They've played together now in their third year, but just coming out game speed. Cliff Kingsbury trying to find ways to get him settled into the game. New Hopkins telling him, hey, man, play me as often as you can and get me the football. They are now starting to kind of find that rhythm. On second and three. Picking up that first down. Good tough running here. Eno Benjamin. Tackled by Davenport. We go back to Kaylee. Well, Al, the Cardinals are moving the ball behind an O-line that's missing. Their starting left guard, Max Garcia, was told he's questionable to return with a shoulder injury in his place. There's Cody Ford. This is his first time on the field since week one. He's been on the IR ever since after an ankle injury in that game. Yeah, they're also missing Justin Pugh, who may be out for the year with an injury. So, mix and match, as so many teams have had to do up front. From the 13-yard line. Oh, that doesn't fool anybody. In particular, number 90, the former Kansas City Chief Tano Passimo. It'll be second down and 14. He's actually reading 90 passing. Watch this. It feels like he's going to take the back. And I think he fooled Kyler Murray into thinking he was going to go with Ingram. But instead, he shows that, and then bang, he brings his head back down and his momentum back down and completely catches Kyler Murray by surprise. That's a great play. Tenth play of the drive. To the outside. Caught. Hopkins started to slip as he made the grab. Down he goes at the 10-yard line. I knew he couldn't keep his feet. Otherwise, I'm going to have broken away from a tackle. He's done that 18 million times. His career will be third and seven. Gives this offense a chance at third down. Remember, Cliff Kingsbury last week, they struggled in the red zone and decided, you know, we had opportunities to kick field goals. We decided not to, even though the analytics said maybe to do so. They had issues last week, and you think now, tonight, still got to have to have that mentality of putting touchdowns on the board down here. You look for the tight end, Ertz, and he hasn't quite a pass. Yeah, hadn't been there. Third and seven. That's caught, but shy of the first down. Speaking of Ertz, people are going to think this is on tape delay, and I made that call. Good call. It's fourth and one, and he's going to send in a play right now. No more field goals. Yeah, they need touchdowns. This is an area that's a major problem the last four games. Dennis Allen, whose pedigree is defense. We'll call the coverage. According to our next-gen stats, powered by AWS, chance of converting your run at 26%, passing 36%. Meanwhile, a timeout will be taken. That timeout taken by the Saints. What do you think, man? What's your call here? Call the play. What do you think? Well, obviously you've got to give Murray the chance to run or throw based on their look. I mean, he's a tailback to me on this possession, on this play. And if they give you the numbers, run him. There are the real numbers now. We gave you fake numbers. Now here are the real numbers. Run 69%, pass 56%. Whatever, we'll find out. Here we go. fourth and one that's a long one you know Benjamin is the back they get the hand there goes Murray and swing into the outside he and he should have the first down he does reaches out needed a yard and a half or so and got what he needed first and goal he also picked up a great block by Humphreys the left tackle who gets out in front just talked about use him as a tailback here enough of the defenders on this formation are inside, so instead of trying to fight between the tackles, get him out on the perimeter. Good block right there by Humphreys, and just to be sure, he gets the ball in the right hand to get it across the line. First and goal. They've been here before. Again, out of the pistol. And timeout is taken here. So 232. And Murray, well, Murray blocking his way over to the sideline. Murray had a lot of that energy last week. He did. Against Seattle, you know, where he would be frustrated. You can see it right there. Yeah. I think that's the buildup of a number of weeks this offense has been struggling. They don't score an offensive touchdown last week. Hopkins comes in to try to calm him down. Stuff happens. As we know, Robbie Anderson got into it in Carolina, with Carolina, the Rams the other day. And the next thing you know, he's on a plane coming to Arizona and joining the Cardinals. And he's in the game right now. First and goal. Got Hopkins at the bottom, one-on-one. Safety in the middle. And the ball off. And fighting his way is Ingram for a touchdown. Deontay Ingram. Into 10 to the end zone goes Marco Wilson. Marquez Callaway could not hold on. First interception of Marco Wilson's two-year career. 38 yards on the run back, and the Cardinals have the lead. Wilson is at the right spot off of a tip ball that goes right through the hands of Callaway Andy Dalton threw one pick where he was late and took a chance and this one on an accurate throw underneath crossing route Blankenship who's made two field goals does not make the extra point Go figure. We got man-to-man coverage by this Vance Joseph defense. Look at the separation by Callaway. It's a great route against Wilson. Has his eyes in. Reacts a little bit late. He's got him beat. He's got some yards, positive yards. This goes through his hands up into the air. And Wilson trailing on it is able to come up with that pick. A heck of a flip there into the end zone. bragged about Dalton in this Saints offense these last three games not throwing the interceptions not turning it over only one in these last three weeks and two here in this first half against the Cardinals and both have been huge one stopped a long drive and this one results in a pick six So each guy with that interception, Hamilton earlier, Wilson now, first of their careers. Wilson, of course, only in his second year, but for Hamilton, crazy, seven years. And there is the turnover differential. They've given the ball away 15 times. They have only six takeaways, so the differential is minus nine, which is the worst in the league. You know, these two teams, the way the league is this year, so many close games. You're 2-4. You could be 4-2. But every game just seems to be a one-possession game. And the makings of maybe that coming tonight, we don't know. And when you throw up a graphic that says you're last in a league in turnover margin, You're talking about every possession matters. They played good football this half, and they're down six, at least for now. See what they can do with this last possession. But I'll tell you you lose games. From the 25-yard line, Dalton. That is caught. He goes back to Callaway. So the guy who just coughed up the last pass, they go right back to number one, and he picks up seven, second and three. Love to see a quarterback do that, showing his guy he believes in him, able to put that play now behind him and keep moving. Saints have two timeouts. Dalton doesn't run much, but when he does, it's normally with some good things happening, as it does right there, as Andy picks up 14 to 47. Yeah, he is an athletic guy, but he is, you know, up in years, 12th year, but shows that when he sees it, he'll take off and go. running a hurry up here tipped at the line second down and ten with 63 seconds on the clock JJ Watt trying to get any advantage he can to get pressure very close that time to lining up off sides not just a hand with that helmet Remember, Olave, their best threat downfield with Thomas still out of this lineup. Dalton to the outside. Caught. He goes back to Callaway. The Cardinals say no. The officials check with each other and say no. he ends up catching it but he's bobbling it as he goes out of bounds he gets sandwiched between the two defenders Hamilton on the inside and Thompson from behind you can see the ball never secured as he goes out of bounds a heck of an effort to try to hold on to it but a better job by Jalen Thompson to knock it loose got it right quarter halftime we've already had 42 points in the game. You know what that means? What? For some people, a point and a half in the promised land. There's a go, a plethora of points. 28-14. Shahid, third player in the Super Bowl era, with a rush and a receiving TD of 40 more yards. First two games. Billy Sims did it. Kareem Hump did it. Andy Dalton. One interception in his first three games. Three tonight. A couple of deflected picks. 42 more than the last two Thursday night games combined. And the Cardinals tonight with a 28-point first half. So Dennis Allen in his first year. Cliff Kingsbury in his fourth season. And a big turnaround in this game, which was at one point 14-6 New Orleans. Fielded at the 8-yard line, Greg Dortch. Out to the 25. Moments ago, Kaylee was down on the field with Saints coach Dennis Allen. Coach, after those three interceptions by Andy Dalton, what was your message to him at halftime? Nothing. Just keep doing what he's doing. You know, one wasn't an unfortunate play on a tip ball that should have been caught. The other one, you know, down in the red area, we've got to avoid that one. And then obviously there at the end of the first half, you know, that last one was a killer. I think the game kind of changed there in that two-minute. So what are your priorities for your team in the second half? Compete, come out here and fight, and that's what we're going to do. All right, thanks. All right, thank you, Kaylee, from the 25-yard line. First scrimmage play is a pass caught by Hopkins up at the 30-yard line. So Hopkins making his season debut tonight. Has five catches worth 42 yards. You know, coaches often talk about the middle eight. The last four minutes of the first half and the first four minutes of the second. The Saints struggled. You just heard Coach talking there with Kaylee. The last two 28, they're outscored 22 to nothing. Parative, they get Kyler Murray in this offense off the field here on this possession. Second down and five. and a little too high you talked about it earlier the Cardinals in six games have run only 13 plays all season long with the lead and these are the first two plays they've run with the lead here because they took the lead and then they got the pick so here they are trying to figure this out we're not used to this second halves they've been trying to get back into games interesting to see a team that loves tempo They believe tonight they can wear the Saints down up front. How do you work with a 14-point lead? That is not caught by Hopkins trying to get it into him. Chris Harris covers on the play. Then it's fourth down. You see Hopkins there motioning back to Murray, but maybe couldn't see the ball. If you're just tuning in, the Saints are down to their fourth and fifth defensive backs, and that ball, I think that's what he was mentioning. He couldn't see the football. It's very unlike Hopkins, even though he's back for his first game to drop that ball. Sometimes when your quarterback is 5'10", maybe you don't see the ball. That's true. Anyway, first punt of the night, Andy Lee, the 40-year-old punter. third oldest player in the league right now and not a very good boot and then takes a sideways bounce and even comes back the other way and gets covered up at the 38-yard line. So one minute into the quarter, J.J. Watt, here he is. He's 12th season. He's been active tonight against the run and the pass, and we all know his career, But I just love to see him work. 6'5", 288, 12th year. There he is as a pass rusher. There he is blowing up a play. Being able to shoot through there and use his strength and his quickness. Trained so hard. He and his brothers trained like maybe the most diligent in the league Quick toss to the outside taken there by Traquan Smith And J know J worked with all of the injuries in recent years Had to scare with his heart Had to be chopped back into rhythm. And then played three or four days later against Carolina earlier this year. Yeah, yeah. And he's just in a different place. He's out of Tennessee. Randy, 4-3-6 at the Combine. So he can run, and he's got length. You can see Hopkins kind of pulling himself. He's actually pulling Taylor a little bit with the hand on the jersey, so it's a clean play. Here's Blankenship now, just signed. A rent, a kicker, trying to kick a 50-yarder. And Blankenship, cut by Indy early in the season, is able to put it through. Each team scores on the opening salvo. What do you know? 7-3. First three weeks with Jameis Winston. Again, Winston in uniform tonight, but would only be used in an emergency situation. As I said earlier, if something happened to Dalton, you'd see Hill in there. They want to use him in all kinds of positions, but he would probably come in to supplant Dalton as the kick goes through the end zone. And they take it over at the 25-yard line. The best thing they did in that first series, they ran the football, and then they did a really good job of getting the ball out. Even here, play action, great protection, and then you've got the safety that takes the crosser, and then there's a heck of a throw by Andy Dalton. If Andy Dalton drops back, takes one hitch, knows where to go with the ball, and he throws such a good deep ball, and just put that ball out in front of Shahid for a touchdown, he's thinking, man, this game's pretty easy. Meanwhile, here's Hill. Hill comes in the quarterback, plays tight end. Dalton is also in the game. Up at the top of the screen. So they can go a lot of different ways here. But the Cardinals are equal to that task. As Tanner Vallejo is right there to take down Mark Ingram. Behind the line of scrimmage for a loss. Stacked at that line. Able to win up front. Get penetration. And meanwhile that's Rashard. Lawrence. plays in the middle on that defensive line who is down for the Cardinals. He actually got the penetration. He's been dealing with a broken hand and tried to play through it last week. He's a very effective interior player. Watch him right over the center just able to shoot through the guard. Brock Morton, who's in as a starter for Pete. Yeah, he even had hand surgery. He is down there working on him right now. We'll step away for a moment. You've got the cart that came out for Rashard Lawrence. He was down, so he'll get a ride back to the locker room. He's out. Meanwhile, earlier, while we were in commercial, another cart. took Bradley Roby back to the locker room. The right shoe is off. As you can see, I'm going to show you how Roby got hurt here. Al, this is the last injury that this Saints defense could afford. Already banged up in the secondary up on Rondell Moore. Just steps on his foot. Goes down and right away grabs his lower leg and then gets carted off. So Dennis Allen's got to be thinking about, okay, what are we going to do here on the back end of this defense? Find out shortly. Lucky Foto comes in. Replacing Lawrence. Second and 11. Dalton on play action throws. That is incomplete at midfield. Intended for Crystal Lave, who missed last week's game with a concussion. Number one pick out of Ohio State. Incomplete. Third down and 11. Yeah, Lave. It's good to see him back. Michael Thomas, Jarvis Landry still out. Lave's going to have to make some plays tonight. We already saw Shahid downfield. Now this is what they wanted to avoid against a Vance-Joseph defense, these third and longs where they can create a lot of confusion up front. Dalton, flushed out, eyes downfield, finds his man at the 41-yard line, and that's Olave making the grab there. so they convert on third and 11 first down. That's a heck of a job by Alave. Watch his route. He man-to-man coverage. And his quarterback gets into trouble. He's trying to run a route across the middle. He wants to go here, recognizes this, and then works back to find that open spot working with Dalton. Really well done by the rookie there to stay in sight of Dalton as he scrambles on that big third down. Kamara back in it, running back his third carry shifts gears and turns what might have been no gain into a six yard gain so Kamara of course, he's been great over his first five years, Pro Bowl a lot of touchdowns he and Henry, the most in his life at this stage of his career, more of a mentor and a leader but still very effective as a player but that was quite a scare and I think gave him a lot of perspective about this stage not only in football but in life And his wife expecting at any moment. Mark Ingram is the running back here on second and one. Comes close. Kaylee, what you got? Al, J.J. Watt has fought through so many of his injuries through those 12 years in the league. But he told us nothing scared him more than when an irregular heartbeat was detected in September. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation on a Wednesday. And was put under anesthesia that Thursday to have his heart shock back into rhythm like you said. the next day. He was back on the practice field and played in their win against Carolina that Sunday. And not only that, but he thought about the fact that his wife was pregnant and he's going to have his first child. He's actually very emotional about it. So now you've got Hill there. He's ready to take the snap. Third down at inches. Taysom Hill. He's going to take it. And picks up two. Buda Baker comes up to stop him, but they're into Arizona territory. so that Andy Lee, 31-yard punt, helping set them up with decent field position and not trying to get back into the game. Pete Carmichael doing exactly what he should do. They had a rhythm. They were doing well with everything until the two pick sixes, and they go right back to their game plan trying to control the front, set up their play-action pass game. That's Hill motioning, sets up behind Dalton. play action, gets hit as he throws and that time Buda Baker came in. So Baker had made the last tackle then he comes in and knocks the ball out of his hand and it's second down and ten. Nick Vanette, the tight end, tried to slow him down right here and he's just not able to slow down the quickness of Baker. You see him actually dip underneath the potential block there by the tight end and gets in there to affect that throw from Andy Dalton. That's a completion if he doesn't get in there and make that play. Second and ten. Each team coming in with a mark of two and four. You've got Hill back there again. Fires over the middle. Wide open. Making the grab. Inside the 20. Goes Crystal Lave. Setting up a first and goal. Missed last week's game with a concussion sustained in the Seattle game when he scored a touchdown. Big game for him tonight. It's tough to be able to match up with Olave in the slot. Turns Murphy completely around. He has such respect for him to go downfield as a vertical threat. And the best thing is the ball is out quickly. Helps the offensive line. Helps Andy Dalton get back. Hitch. Ball out. And great separation there by Olave. 41-yard game. Four catches, 81 yards for him. Put a full back in to the outside, going nowhere, at least Camara. Stopped behind the line of scrimmage. It'll be second down and goal. Jesse LaTeta making the stop on the play. Apologize. I want to make sure I give Taysom Hill credit for that throw. I said Andy Dalton. Hill has really been known. We talked all first half doing so many different things. One of the things he's not done a ton of this year is throw the football. Only 3 of 5 coming into tonight, so reminding this defense of what he's capable of doing. It's not just about running. 2 for 2 tonight, 48 yards. Ingram is the back. He'll get it from Dalton, and he's tackled immediately. Ben Neiman, the former chief, makes the stop. It's third and goal. Red zone for the Saints last week against Cincinnati. 1 of 5. It's been a strength all year. One of the tops, in fact, going into last week, Pete Carmichael had the second-best red zone offense. They were second. And then they go 1-5, and it cost them the game against the Bengals. Down 14. He needs a touchdown here. Play clock down to three. Dolphin hangs in there, throws. and that's incomplete. Traquan Smith had a touchdown reception last week against Cincinnati. Couldn't hold on. Byron Murphy having a great year. Breaking it up. Fourth and goal. Dalton kind of hangs in there. Hangs in there and then throws late but he actually gets it in there. The ball gets to Smith. Both of his hands around the football and just not able to play action. Open. And then losing it. Did he have control of it. No, Alave could not hold on. And that's Marco Wilson, who had the big interception before, who knocks it away to be second down and ten. Alave usually sure-handed, but Marco Wilson hit him. Coming right from the left. As soon as he holds on or gets a hold of that football, 20 with that shoulder separates him from the football. He knew it was coming, tried the brace for it, just unable to hold on. Ready! Let it stop! Kamara. Nice tackle is made there. Zach Allen, Marcus Golden. Both converged on the third down at eight for the Saints. That's Zach Allen, who these coaches are very high on. Fourth year out of Boston College, up at the top. Watch him use his hands. extend, separate, and then get involved in trying to slow down Kamara before he can pick up some serious yards. His idol growing up was J.J. Watt, and now he plays alongside on that front. Bolton looks at the play clock. Snaps it at two. deep down the left side and incomplete you got a lobby running down there with Marco Wilson pressure put on in the backfield fourth down and seven good work by the Arizona defense this is what makes Vance Joseph's defense so hard they walk up all these defenders and try to make you figure out as an offensive line who's going to come and who's going to drop and because you're not on the same page it affects the timing it affects the protection and it's a great job of dialing that up and dictating it by Joseph. First punt of the night. Blake Gilligan. And that bounds out of bounds. And Arizona with a pair of three and outs to start the third quarter. Coming back out. The Kuhl family has owned this team for eons. They're still looking for that first championship since 1947. Obviously before the Super Bowl era from the 15-yard line. But a lot more success recently than in the past. Passing you. You know, they came so close, Kirk, in the Super Bowl after the 2008 season against Pittsburgh. It's like, what was Arizona even doing in the game, right? They have that magical run in the playoffs. Larry Fitzgerald was fantastic. Kurt Warner, 2 minutes and 20 seconds to go in the game. They have the lead. And then Roethlisberger led the Steelers down. Holmes made the catch. You and I were talking about that game on the field before, just kind of reminiscing a little bit about some of their teams that they've had. You're right. They were right there. Ended up being one of the better Super Bowls we've had. And James Harrison had that 100-yard return, which to me is maybe the greatest play in Super Bowl history. That's caught for a first down up at the 26-yard line. Zach Gertz, the longtime Eagle, traded over here in the middle of last season. Heck of a throw by Kyler Murray, but Zach Ertz can still do it. Find the seams, find the opening, and the toughness to be able to hold on to that ball. Leads him in there. Ertz knows exactly what's coming with Demario Davis unloading. He does a great job of being able to protect himself because the ball got out early by Murray. play fake catch not made and it's busted up by Pete Werner Urch could not hold it in shook him down and 10 I thought, here he goes again, they're going to go right back to him different route, kind of a crosser he's going to work across the field here but boy, Pete Werner we talked about him earlier, how he can do so many different things How about how he locates Ertz, anticipates that he's coming into his area, and then the ball's completed, and then it's not because he doesn't give up on the play. Has that left hand in there to be able to separate it. Five and a half left in the third. Guards up by 11. Second and 10, and long dead. false start offense number 86 5 yard penalty second down New Hopkins has come back tonight after the 6 game suspension early in the game just not quite on the same page that's in the red zone they come over and they work things out that's their DNA or it has been Benjamin second down standings talked about how tight it is in both divisions So here it is right now. In the south, you've got Tampa Bay and Atlanta at 3-3. Saints 2-4. And the Panthers are 1-5. Meanwhile, the 49ers and the Rams and the Seahawks are all 3-3. And Arizona's trying to go to 3-4. Isn't that amazing how many teams in this league are either 2-4, 3-3, or 4-2? A few outliers that are better and worse. But everybody's kind of hovering right around 500. 12 of the 16 teams in the NFC are 500 or below at this point. Second down and nine. Murray going deep and too deep and incomplete. Robbie Anderson, just talking about Robbie's good for just a couple of plays, covered there by Taylor. First time they target him, the former Jet and Panther, and it's third down. And I think this is what Cliff Kingsbury envisions, especially with Marquise Brown down, is him getting downfield, to take some of the pressure off of New Hopkins. That's what he's known for. You see a little pull there at the end. That's what he was asking about, but that ball was past him. But he's 6'3", 190. His reputation, his great ball skills, great deep threat, can stretch a defense. And eventually, I think, when he gets more familiar with his system, that's what he'll become. Third down nine. in the end zone and coming out of the end zone trying to do something, anything taking down to the 10 yard line Cam Jordan chased him Cam Jordan is right there and then he hit the afterburners that burst button and just walks away from the potential sack in the end zone Cam's all the way to the top beats his man and thinks he has a chance forget about it but Murray still takes that sack. Yeah. Turns out to be a loss of six, and Murray is hobbling as he comes to the sideline. He took a little shot there and linch his way over to the bench, and now Lee comes in to punt on fourth down. I think all of that scrambling, the wear and tear that it puts on his body where you just like to see him throw it away and save some of that energy. Lee's boot. 40-yard line. She'll breeze in retirement right now. Looking on tonight. I don't know. His coach, Sean Payton, said he was somewhere in the building. And now the question becomes, what about the future? As Dalton goes back to throw, caught by Kamara, and he'll pick up the first down. Okay. But it's all about which quarterback is going to take care of the football. Dalton has been doing an incredible job of that until tonight with the three picks. Wasn't helped a lot by his receivers either. That's the matter of making the catch. That may open the door. You're right. Andy Dalton, like I said, he kind of has that veteran calming effect. He just seems to make everybody believe that he's going to put them in the right play. If we go to 2-5 though a lot of things to think about and that's going to be a first down as Smith makes the catch there and remember this offense is trying to figure things out without Michael Thomas without Jarvis Landry and Olave came back tonight so there it is this year he's got 1-2 coming in but Winston 17 points a game Dalton 30 coming in and the run pass percentage as you can see So 2-1 for Winston, throwing it. More on the ground, obviously, with Dalton. Dalton. A little dart. And that's taken to the 16-yard line by Kamara. So Saints are trying to inch their way back into the game. And see, with Kamara, he's a difference maker that right now the defense is scheming to take him out. If you have Thomas and Landry and Olave, it takes so much pressure off of him and how much more effective he can be. Blitz coming, picked up, caught down the sideline, and working his way is Jawan Johnson into the end zone. Exactly what the Saints needed. They needed to do it quickly. That's 17 yards. They had the ball for a minute and 40, went 46 yards, and get back in the game. Again, they walk everybody up at the line of scrimmage. pressure is on this offensive line and Dalton knows it, finds exactly where he wants to go with the ball and what he did is he got it out quickly to Johnson inaccurately which allowed him to make that catch, get the first down and then he had room on that sock about it. You can start to see by about the third possession Hopkins starting to get into a rhythm with Kyler Murray even getting involved and making a nice block there on Tyron Matthews, so he's settling in here in his first game of the year Murray fires has the open man, there he goes to the 40, Hopkins holding on and a first down so they needed 15 yards and got 17 knows exactly where he needs to go and he's got Chris Harris, the veteran on him, but is a backup at this stage of his career, but forced in to start and gives him a huge cushion, and it makes it very easy that time for Hopkins to come off of that route, crossed the first down marker, and an easy throw there for Kyler Murray. Six grabs for him, averaging 10 yards per reception. Coming around from the outside, Greg Dortch, the receiver at 5'7". Meanwhile, Hopkins through 26 games with the Cardinals. Most catches in team history through 26. Yards second, TDs third. Most all-pro first-team selections. You've got Brown with four since 2000. Calvin Johnson with three. Hopkins with three. And right now a timeout on the field because Contavious Street is down there. the St. defensive lineman. Incredible how consistent Hopkins has been in his career, first with the Texans and then coming over here in 2020 and just his fit in very nicely with Kyler Murray and Cliff Kingsbury in this offense. That was a stunning trade when it was made. I mean, Texan fans are going, what? Kaylee, a little more on Hopkins? Yeah, Al, I spoke with the performance coach that Hopkins worked with during his six-week suspension. And Nick Hill told me Hopkins was at the training facility every day at 7 a.m. He was simulating each game week along with the Cardinals' schedule. They used Hopkins' data from last season to guide his workouts so they could work to match his acceleration, his top speed, and even how many times he would make cuts in a practice or game. And Hill assured me Hopkins right now is as strong as he has ever been. Yeah, we've watched him for years, especially the years in Houston. He makes unbelievable catches. The catch radius is tremendous and breaks so many tackles. Second down and nine. Murray, pressured. Swings it to the outside. Cutting back in. making a little something out of nothing is Eno Benjamin making it to third down and short one of the things that Dennis Allen wanted to do was make sure that they did a good job on obvious passing situations of trying to squeeze the pocket from the outside and then spying him with a linebacker this time it's Davis nowhere for Murray to run and escape to try to pick up a first down make him just check it down get the ball out of his hands because of how quick he can be. Three and a half left in the third. Third and three. To the outside. Plenty of room to roam. A little high step in there. Benjamin makes the grab. Forced out by Marcus May, and they convert. That's a miscommunication here. You wonder if to Mario Davis maybe should be over here and follow the back to the outside. Because you'll see the coverage on the right, they clear out. They're playing man-to-man. Well, somebody has to account for the back slipping out of the backfield. Davis there, instead of being worried about what's going on with Kyler Murray, if he could have locked up Benjamin, would have been a much better opportunity for the Saints to get off the field there on third down. From the 38, play action again. Passes a little low, but hauled in there by DeAndre Hopkins. She's in a healthy dose tonight. They've targeted him ten times. He's scored seven for 68 yards. Sometimes Cliff Kingsbury plays a left receiver, right receiver, so they can go fast. They're moving him around. Going fast right now on second and one. Take the toss. Throw. That's caught. Adjusting was Hopkins. Turns to the outside. Covered by the rookie, Taylor. And they're just outside the ten. There's the... Davis Winston playing the role of emergency quarterback tonight. Let's see what happens in 11 days. Dalton pressured. Swings it away. Stops the clock. That took 6 seconds. 54 left. But, again, Vance Joseph, instead of being conservative, he's once again going back to that wrinkle where he walks everybody up. The difference here is the tight end, Johnson stays in, and also your back Camara eventually leaks out. But, I think Andy Dalton, again, maybe feeling that pressure from a Joseph defense and wanted to get the ball out. There's just nobody open downfield. on third and 15 Kamara has to get out of bounds and he does but it will be fourth down Byron Murphy and now you're going to bring Lutz and his crew in to try to get that field goal and make it an eight point game so Kamara's effort there where he could have been tackled in bounds just getting out of bounds gives the Saints a chance here at the field goal and a potential onside kick 45-yarder for Lutz, who had that fabled double doink in London against Minnesota about a month ago. And he's able to put this one through. So it's 42-34. And the onside kick will be next. So if they recover the onside kick, we'll have to maybe get a hold of the next-gen stats to see the probability. We don't have to. Would it go to 2%? I'd just be curious to see what it would go to. I can't help myself. What do you want me to tell you? The schedule is coming up. Saints will meet Las Vegas and Baltimore back-to-back at home at Pittsburgh. And the Rams and Niners. Meanwhile, Arizona goes to Minnesota next week. Seattle comes in here. Then they go to the Rams and play San Francisco. and the Chargers back here in Weeks 11 and 12. So it has to go 10 yards. You've got Taysom Hill is on the field. He's the second guy from the bottom. And the kick will go that way. and it's covered up by Arizona. So you've got Zach Ertz. The tight end with the good hands. Next Gen just told us 100. What can I tell you? Yeah. Yeah. 101%. 101 with an exclamation. I'm giving 110%. So Kyle Murray will wrap it up, and the Arizona Cardinals will go to 3-4, and the Saints will go to 2-5. and week 7 the capper of the beginning of week 5 will be in the books and that will take us to the finish line first 40 point game since 2017 it's the longest streak in the NFL over that period of time 87 games without hitting the 40 number. Cliff Kingsbury, who's been feeling it, needed that win. This team needed that win. Now they get a week off to regroup and feel good about what they're doing right now with this offense. See if they can get on a little roll. So for the first time in a calendar year, the crowd will leave here happy. At least the Cardinal fans will. As they had lost eight consecutive games. the last five last year and the first three this year at home. Post-game show coming right up. Don't go anywhere. See you in a post-game right after these messages. He's been everywhere, and even before he took this job as a coach, he bounced around. He was out at USC for, what, a month? About a month, yep. I think he wound up on Sean McVay's staff for 20 minutes. Now here, Kaylee. Well, Al, we've got some free advice, bad advice, and the earth gifted the watch a red 99 Wednesday. Yeah, the great thing, Kaylee, for J.J. is that they get the long week and a half after this one. Don't play until a week from Sunday. Olave makes that catch, picking up about seven. So now you put the Saints, without their top, a lot of their top receivers, and kind of a two-minute approach. Don't have Thomas or Landry means Olave and some of these backup receivers are going to have to win and win quickly. Yeah, two-minute approach with 15 minutes to go in the game. Yeah. One more second to play here in the third. Third down and three. This takes them out of their comfort level. You know, in the years of Drew Brees, they could obviously fight right back and get themselves a chance. and this offense, where they are at this stage of the season, they are still a run-the-football set-up play action, especially with the injuries that they've sustained on the outside. Hey! Hey, load it, load it, load it! Load it, load it, load it! Changing it, play clock ticking down. Snap it at one. get it away but it's batted down and that's going to take us to the fourth it's also going to give the ball back to Arizona after an ensuing putt 35-17 after three brought to you by State Farm State Farm Stadium they hosted two Super Bowls here and both were classics and the next one is played here in February as well So fourth down and three Al Michaels Along with Kirk Curvestre Kaylee Hartung working the sideline Our whole gang Fred Goodelli, Pierre Moussa Malibu Kelly Hayes George Shilm My boys for four decades Got them all Gilligan's punt Is a beauty and pins him at about the 10-yard line. Sir. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. We bragged about Andy Dalton only throwing one interception coming into tonight in his three starts, and you can see the probability of him winning this game. First pick early, they had a 7-3 lead here. 14-14, near the end of the first half. Interception for six. Marco Wilson, they get the ball back. His third interception, this time by Isaiah Simmons to the house, in the blink of an eye, 22 points up on the board and a decisive Cardinals advantage. And a decisive current chance of winning, in case you're wondering. So you're saying? I'm saying with an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter, yeah, it's about 98-2. Breaking news. Pass over the middle. Not one-handed by Hopkins. Had to reach up and back for it. And a complete pop there by Marcus May, second out of ten. The Saints are saying, we'll take a couple pick-sticks is trying to affect that probability. Just looking over at the targets, and we anticipated Hopkins getting a lot of chances. If you add up all the other receivers and running backs and tight ends, he's almost, at this stage of the game, has as many as the rest combined. So Cliff Kingsbury definitely not easing Newt Hopkins back into the lineup. And even though Robbie Anderson, that just acquired one, has been in for a couple of plays, hasn't been targeted. Murray runs into his own man, runs into a lot of traffic, and he flagged. Holding. Defense. Number 19. Five-yard penalty. First down. A 12-year veteran, Chris Harris. So even when he's not getting targeted, he wins. Chris Harris is a veteran, but again, he's been on the practice squad with injuries. He's had to move up. Hopkins setting him up to be able to pull away from him, and Harris realized he was leaving him, so just grabs onto him. Interesting approach. We wondered, they've always been behind, and Cliff Kingsbury tonight going up against Dennis Allen has this lead, and they're still even backed up near their own goal line, still throwing the ball. We'll never forget. Let look at Kyler Murray and Hopkins back tonight trying to get on the same page And boy have they He is targeted a bunch of times tonight 13 in total 9 receptions The greatest thing is being able to see their timing as this game has gone on. Paul is out. This is his first game. And look how he puts it where Hopkins can make a play. And of course he has that big catch radius but I mean look from the first quarter to this point in the game there's a difference between the rhythm and the timing between Kyler Murray and Newk Hopkins. So now it's clock bleeding time. Or not. Or not to Hopkins. And he picks up a few here to the outside, and now the Saints have to take their first of three timeouts. Ten catches for him now, and 103 yards for Hopkins. In Cliff Kingsbury's offense, when he has a quarterback like Murray, who he trusts, that's an extension of their run game. I mean, that's basically a handoff on an RPO where they're overloaded on the run. They expect you to run. You flip it out there with an easy completion. There's a look at Hopkins compared to the rest of the squad. Right. And, again, Moore, two targets, Ingram, a couple. Benjamin, five. But he scored four for 21 yards. They swing him out. Urch with a couple of receptions and Dorch with one for the TD. Do you think they missed Hopkins a little bit? No question. And they had Hopkins and Hollywood Brown, too. Yeah, yeah. This offense has just been spinning its wheels. And now they have their guy back. Right, and quicksand. Second and seven. Going nowhere. They'll stop the clock here again. That's Ingram. Third down. So the report from Adam Schefter at ESPN is that Christian McCaffrey has been now traded from Carolina to the 49ers. So Robbie Anderson dealt from Carolina to Arizona. And then McCaffrey, who's been rumored to be on the block, will go to San Francisco. Pretty good landing spot. I'll say, yeah. Not bad. Stanford guy. Third and six now. Dennis Allen Last seven years as the defensive coordinator When Sean Payton Stepped aside They figured well let's go defense Because you've got Pete Carmichael Still going to run the offense Keep the continuity Third and six And They will stop him A couple of yards side That's Ingram again So it's fourth down. Saints take their final timeout. Here it is. Charlie Trippi from the Chicago Cardinal years. And, you know, football was played differently then, but I mean, still. He was a big fan of Taysom Hill and everything that Taysom Hill does. Sure. I mean, Hill, in today's world, is about the closest you get to that. That's about as close as you get, for sure. Andy, lead a punt, and it will bound into... No! They were able to keep it out of the end zone. No, no. Touchback. Just for the moment, it looked like they could save it outside the goal line, but they can't. Hamilton came close, but no good. Let's go back to the And it's one handed That is Traquan Smith Who's down, needs a moment He's down on the turf Will they stop the clock here For the end, no, Smith is going to come off They hustle to the line He's tackled there by Byron Murphy Clock down to 220 First down What a throw by Andy Dalton to start this drive Right over Murphy Into the hands of Smith That's caught up at the 45 By Crystal Lave And that's going to take us to the 2 minute warning So with 2 minutes to go in regulation They're at their own 45 yard line In an 11 point game Next week To Tampa Lamar Jackson Ravens Tom Brady Buccaneers Thursday night 7 Eastern to get it started 8.15 for the kickoff on prime You know, even though Andy Dalton He turns the corner and picks up the touchdown Beats the rookie out of Cincinnati MyJ Sanders on that play Now Lutz for the extra point And all of a sudden It's an 11 point game And that 98-2 probability Probably shrunk a little bit Just a little bit, we think. 35-24, 11-14 to go. The whole thing. It's okay. Yeah. But a lot of folks do like Halloween coming up. Yeah. Around the corner. Dressed for the occasion. And all of a sudden, we have a game. 11 points. 11-14 remaining in the fourth. From the five-yard line, Dorch, who visited the end zone. Within the past few minutes. Defense flying around, they believe. Off this week. Get him in two weeks down in Houston. Here goes Murray to the outside. He's taken down by the neck by Marcus Davenport. So if you're the Saints, you're taking Murray's run threat. This is an offense that struggles to work clock, struggles to run the football with their backs, all hands on deck to stop the potential of Kyler Murray in the QB run game. Make them move the ball some other way. Three turnovers, the major difference in the game. Second and six. Murray to the outside he goes finds his man again DeAndre Hopkins and that moves the sticks again they're working with the lead and keeping their foot on the gas this ball's in the air before Hopkins gets out of his break and yet he's just playing his first game look at the ball in the air hasn't even that ball's three quarters of the way in the air before Hopkins comes out of his break great job there by Murray of anticipating that and putting it where Hopkins could have a chance. Hopkins off that six-game suspension. Nine receptions, 99 yards. Handed off inside. No room there. Then swinging to the outside. Flag comes in. Tough, great running there. Eno Benjamin. and the flag thrown horse collar here likely will face mask was the face mask instead got him front and back Cam Jordan double team tries to get out of it make a play and it looked like the right ring finger may have locked into that face mask and pulled it. 15 yards on top of the run. An 8 yard run which turns out to be a 23 net gain. Ball at the 22 yard line. probing on the ground. 19-yard line. Benjamin. So, folks, if you watched the baseball game tonight, Astros lead two games to nothing after beating the Yankees 3-2 tonight. And Houston, Saints' first drive there. Murray, his numbers tonight. It was at 1.14-6 in favor of the Saints. You have Hopkins coming back off the suspension, catching nine balls tonight. at the Cardinals defense. Three interceptions. Two of them pick sixes. Really changed the complexion of the game near the first half. It was 14-14. And by the time we went to the half, 28-14. Second and seven. Taking time off the clock are the Cardinals and fighting his way to the 15-yard line. That's on his Ingram. Pretty good job up front by this offensive line. I mean, the Saints know they're going to run the football. And watch the push here to give Ingram, who again, who's a downhill physical back. Good job, Billy Price, making his first start since he came over from Las Vegas. Ingram holding that ball high and tight, protecting it. Big play here coming up on third and three. He got a flip. Looks none the worse to wear, at least with a naked eye. and it's a first down here as Dalton throws over the middle caught and that's another first down Mark Ingram his daddy was also a first round pick back with the New York Giants in the 80s Murray on the bench Dalton leads him to the line going quick pace here they have to with 447 with shoulder shake looking for somebody and then fires it out of play it'll be second down and 10. Yeah, Vance Joseph is just trying to keep everything in front of him. Doesn't want to give up an easy score. He is still mixing up the looks. He went with 5 up front. Then he dropped with just 4. Had 7 in coverage. And that time rushing just 3 with 8. So still trying to mix it up. Still trying to create some confusion for Dalton without having necessarily blitz and still play coverage. To the outside, and nothing happening there because Johnson is tackled immediately by Marcus Golden, number 44, setting up third down. You see all these guys up, and then they drop at the snap of the ball, so it affects Dalton and his clock thinking, I've got to get the ball out. Then they just sit back in zone, So it looks like you're going to get man-to-man pre-snap, thinking you need to get it out, and then they sit back on you. They're doing it again. To the outside. And clearly in four-down territory here, Treyquan Smith to make it fourth down and four. So easy to drive on the ball for these defensive backs with a commanding lead late in the game. Just keep everything in front. You know the ball is coming out quickly. And then just try to come up, keep them short of that first down marker. Trying to keep the patient breathing is Andy Dalton here. With four minutes to play. And it's caught. And it will be first and goal. Marcus Callaway takes it inside the five. Tackled there by Wilson. First and goal. I think there's some kind of mix up there. Because Smith and Callaway are in the same spot. And somehow that ball gets to Callaway for that first down. It worked. Been aligned here. Dalton takes a toss and taking himself cannot get in tackle at the one a blue the bigger clock keeps ticking second and goal Colton. Turning and making the grab. Johnson. Jawan Johnson in the end zone. The old back shoulder play to the outside. He goes and Jawan Johnson takes it in for his second touchdown of the night. Remember, he's a tight end but a college-wide receiver. So you can flex him out. He's very comfortable, and look at the difference in size. 6'4", 230 against 5'11", 190. Put it up in the air, get a little rub route, but that's where the versatility of Jawan Johnson can really pay off for you down in tight near the goal line. He's getting the start tonight because Adam Troutman is out with an injury. Lutz now for the point after. That's good. Well, 42-31, you've got potential onside kick. You also have all of your timeouts and the two-minute warning. So you're going to get four clock stoppages. A couple of ways you can go here. Yeah, yeah. You would think because they're still down by 11, you've got to go onside kick. You just have to get the ball back and hope you get that bounce. Even with the timeouts and the two-minute warning. That is the assumption. Well, you know, this stadium, I'll tell you what. Two of the greatest Super Bowls ever played right here. When the Giants played the Patriots in 07, and the pass were going for the undefeated season, and the insane David Tyree catch off his helmet with Rodney Harrison right there, and then Burris with a touchdown, and then we did the game in 14. That pass intercepted at the goal line as they're going to take the lead in the final minute by Malcolm Butler, and we showed that, and Richard Sherman just threw up. Were you surprised, by the way? Shocked. Yeah. You were waiting for Marshawn to... No, I wasn't. Chris Collinsworth was. I thought they should have rolled Wilson out. What do I know? Okay. Onside kick attempt is covered at the 49-yard line by Trey McBride. Flag thrown in before the play. Maybe 12 men in the huddle there. Too many in the huddle, according to Jerome Bolger. Yep. 12 in the huddle. offense. Five-yard penalty. Still third down. Yeah, so that's third down and eight. It's a big play in the sense that for the Saints to have to stop them to keep it a field goal, it's still a two-possession game. A touchdown is a three-possession game. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, it's a big third down for the Saints' defense. They've got to get pressure. And again, make sure they contain Murray who's a threat. Sometimes the most effective play is when everybody's covered downfield and he scrambles for a first down on third down. spread out three receivers to the left let's go he says snap it at one keep it on the ground exactly what they needed arizona and new orleans did not need eno benjamin they call a run on the third and eight he makes his first and goal and takes more time off the clock you see him check there he's checking to the run because Look at the line of scrimmage. Saints are spread all over the place. That line that we just talked about doing a better job, double team on the left, good adjustment and a call there by Kyler Murray. Rolls the dice on third down and long and gets good blocking up front against the light box to get the first down. There you go. I knew you'd use that sooner or later. Running against that light box is a good time to run. Yep. 10 carries, 86 yards for Benjamin tonight. Through the middle to the four-yard line. Benjamin again. Jordan in on the tackle. Under seven minutes to go. And Dalton's saying, just give me the ball back. Give me a chance. I think they had a little bit of momentum and confidence that they could get this offensive. Kyler Murray's off the field, but you've got to give credit to this offensive line. And in obvious running situations, controlling things for the most part up front. And utilizing the clock. Six and a half left in the fourth. Second and goal. On the ground. Trying to work his way in there. No, he's a little bit short. Benjamin again. 12 carries 90 yards. He had one 45-yard carry and 45 yards on the other 11. Tell me what, man. This kid runs hard. He did it Arizona State, and he's doing it now with his opportunity. He extends there. I'll have to ask Terry. I thought he broke the plane before he went down. That's like a touchdown to me. His butt is down, and then it should be a touchdown. As hard as he ran on that play, deserves a touchdown. And they gave him the touchdown. So initially, they were going to spot it outside the goal line, and now they let him get in. He's known for his lateral quickness, and, you know, he catches the ball out of the backfield. And tonight, we've seen him get between the tackles, lower his shoulder, and with lateral quicks inside there and bouncing off of people. So Connor is out. Darrell Williams is out. So Benjamin with his moment to shine and making the most of it. Blankenship. For the point after. I feel like we've made up for three weeks of touchdowns tonight. You feel better? It's like, are we even now? Not yet. Not yet. We've got to get the taste out of our mouths. 42 to 24. Chula. And now the Saints down by 18 again. Come out to the 25-yard line. Cardinals with the advantage of those two-pick sixes. But wouldn't you say, as we move forward, we'll see how this one ends, but their offense, which has been sputtering and kind of searching for an identity, they've looked better tonight. They just look like there's a rhythm. Hopkins coming back, I think, gets you excited. Robbie Anderson being inserted. Six weeks from now, you throw in Hollywood Brown, and all of a sudden you start to get some confidence going with their potential. I haven't mentioned his name. He's out with a foot injury for about a month and a half, they think. Johnson makes that catch there. Second down. And keep in mind, we've seen Keontae Ingram and, you know, Benjamin step in for James Conner and Darrell Williams and run pretty well. You know, so. Second and three. Timing. Back shoulder fade. This is all about timing. He's going up against the rookie. Taylor Ball's in the air now. Comes back. Sees it in the air. Just a feel there. That's throwing in hours and hours over the years. So even though he hadn't been on the field over the years, that's where your rhythm can really start to work out for you. And this is an offense that's been searching for rhythm and consistency. It's amazing when you bring back your best receiver how that can help things out. Even if the sign misses a K. First and ten. To the outside. Can he turn the corner and get into the end zone? Ingram. Yes. Touchdown. Deontay Ingram with his second rushing touchdown of the night. I thought they would give him more of an opportunity for coming in for Benjamin. He's going to extend and try to get in, but it looks like he's going to be short. Take it back. He still has only one rushing touchdown tonight because this one will come back. But I tell you, again, they don't have James Conner. They don't have Darrell Williams. Benjamin and Ingram together, pretty effective and a different feel in the running style. Of course, you're... After review, the ball carrier was stopped short of the goal line. Good. That's the way you do reviews. I mean, unless it's razor thin, that's obvious. Of course, when it comes to running backs, number one is maybe the best player. Right. So first and goal. Will they give Ingram the ball again to get him in officially? We'll see. That left side's been opening up some nice holes with Cody Ford and DJ Humphreys. Ball inside the one. Ingram is the back. Low snap. He gave it to him, but the snap was low. So we were talking about Billy Price playing his first game of the year. Hasn't seen any action until tonight. And then puts one into the ground. And he had a big defensive lineman, Shai Tuttle, right over top of him. And that affects the snap. I mean, it's actually, especially for a baseball player like Murray, he could have handled that. Almost looked like it surprised him, the timing of it, as much as it being low. So Ingram, who was into the end zone and overturned, got it again from the one. And because of the snap, loses four. Now Benjamin is back in as the runner. And we come down to a half minute to go. And Arizona's going to take a timeout. So that's the first of the second half. We have 32 seconds remaining in the third. Just before the delay of game, Cliff Kingsbury trying to get that timeout. Remember, the red zone's been a problem. And they've done a better job tonight with these last four games. It's been a head-scratcher. Down to really half of a second. Saves five yards. His best offense tonight has been the secondary. No doubt about it. Anytime he can get on the edge, he's always a threat. You know, they put a lot of pressure on the defense. Hopkins moving. Second and goal. To the left side. Caught and into the end zone. Greg Dortch. Touchdown. Justin Evans gives a big cushion, which they take advantage of. He is back off, and it's just a quick throw here. Watch how quickly Murray sees this. He already knows outside leverage because he has help on the inside with his safety may. But that ball got out so quickly by Murray, thrown right where his receiver has a chance, but the cushion by Evans sets it up. It's a 5'7", third-year man out of Wake Forest. Extra point. Which he missed earlier. Blankenship, this one. Bangs it through and with 29 seconds to go in the third. Ian, Arizona. The home team leads 35-17. Plants for a while. Denver, the Jets, Buffalo. Barely played. Went to NFL Europe. Played with Cologne. Dalton. Threads it in there, but there's a lobby hold on to it. Man, oh man, what a shot. He takes from Jalen Thompson. It came out. Along the sideline. Thompson hits him. You know, they feel that between Baker and Thompson, they have the best tandem or one of the best tandems. It's a pretty good throw, by the way. Puts it right where it needs to be. And then Thompson comes in and watch this. Clean hit. Separates him. That is beautiful. Beautiful play by Jalen Thompson. Saints bench saw it the other way. Third down and three. Dalton can't convert here. Trying to get it to counterweight, but he got a flag. Covered there by Marco Wilson, who says, what? He prevented him from getting to his spot. It's a pretty easy call. Number 20. Five-yard penalty, automatic first down. Callaway's trying to work. Gives him an outside move to your right, and then he'll come back to the inside. He just prevents him from getting there. Just locks him up. Haven't seen much of Hill in the second half. Dalton. Stepping away. Stepping outside. Caught. Stays in bounds. Picks up the first half. Does on Traquan Smith. Oh, and then you got a little action there. I mean, Smith was doing a little stepping over him. And Hamilton gets into it. And you can see that coming right from the start when he got up. You're all over it. I think it was him stepping over top of Hamilton. And Hamilton wasn't having it. A lot of times receivers and defensive backs get caught up in their one-on-one matchups as opposed to the game. You've got to play smart. Can't react like that by Hamilton. You can understand why he felt disrespected and makes him get up ready to fight, but you're up. You're up 42-24. You've got to have some poise. A night to remember for Hamilton, seven years in the league, first pick. And it was a big one. And we don't see a flag yet. Maybe they're just saying, hey, man. Terry, you think that's the way to do that? Just play it clean? Absolutely. Just break that up. Nobody really, really, no blow to the head, no nothing. They just got caught up, tangled up. I think it's a great job just breaking that up. It's called a draw, right? It's a draw. Exactly. I couldn't have said it better, Al. Yes, you could have. She's made that up on the fly. That's the result of the play. See the Cardinal players in the background there, still looking up at the big screen saying they didn't like the Smith response when she got tackled. through a it's a review of this I thought Boger said something about did he say the 36 yard line at first when he announced it the ball is now at the 46 yard line so where did Smith go out is the question because you saw Allen pointing down toward the goal line. And whatever Boger said, where is it here? So, yeah. There is no challenge on the plate. New Orleans have made the line to game. First down. All right, they made the line to game. That's what the question is. They make the first down. And they did. So your basic administrative stoppage. Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii. All right, 46-yard line, first down. For what it's worth, Saints have all of their timeouts. Dalton throws. That's caught. And another catch there by Olabe. I seen that game last week. This was a few moments ago. We saw Murray stagger off a few minutes ago, and he came out of the tent, so they wanted to check Kyler out. In his first year in New Orleans, he still brings 12 years of experience as a quarterback in the NFL. Working with some receivers that he doesn't have a ton of experience with, but he is familiar with two minutes and needing points quickly. So see what he can do here in this situation. No timeouts. Got to work the boundary the best he can. Got to think the Cardinals are going to maintain that approach they did on the last drive. just sitting back, giving those underneath throws, and letting the clock keep moving. You saw Traquan Smith hobble off after that last catch. They put him in the tent. So again, minus Thomas, minus Landry. Now Smith is out, minus the tight end Troutman. Somehow trying to stay in the game here. And running a two-minute offense. Yeah. I thought we'd see more of Phil in the second half. I'm surprised. I think once they dug themselves that hole, it becomes a different approach with their offense. And remember, Jawan Johnson's been making some plays that tied in. Oh, Dalton buys time. Dalton deep downfield. He's got a man open, but he couldn't get it to him. And Callaway had gotten behind the corner. The safety was coming in over the top. But he was there. Couldn't get it to him. Third and five. Yeah, a little bit of confusion on the back end of his defense. And then Hamilton slips. Actually gets turned around. And no protection over the top. Baker was occupied down the middle of the field by Kevin White, who's been inserted into the lineup because of Smith being out. Yeah, White caught one earlier for 64 yards. Third and five. Dalton. Looking for the sideline. Looking for the first down. Gets both. Freyfond Smith just went to the locker room. So he'll be done for the rest of the game. Here's the play that Smith got hurt on. He makes the catch. All the weight there of Murphy came down on him. On that bang-bang play there for a first down. Let's see what Dalton did. Dalton, good job of escaping there to give him a new set of downs. Number 49 underneath Camara. Well, the Cardinals making sure he's not going to get to the sideline, and the clock keeps rolling. Just leverage the football. Don't let him get to the sideline. Keep that clock ticking. Second and three. Of course, if they can get into field goal range, you can go both ways here. Kamara. And Simmons loses his helmet. That'll be a first down. So you have the choice here right now. Do you want to go for the field goal now and then the onside kick? They're close enough for Lutz. Clearly within his range. They'll keep going here with first down. Clock ticking to a minute. Dolphin pressured as he throws and throws that one away. 60 seconds. And it doesn't look like there's any movement at all on the Saints sideline. Still with a minute to go. No timeouts. Clock stops. Maybe take another play or two to see if you can give yourself a better chance. Maybe down to the 10 to 15 or 20-yard line. Maybe take a shot to the end zone. Lutz is one of the best in the league. He had a 48-yard field goal clearly within his range. But what do we know? Second and 10. I'm going to get him five more yards anyway. My J. Sanders. Before the movement, timeout Arizona. So Arizona took the timeout beforehand. 30 seconds, timeout. All right. Some points were put on the board tonight, as if there's any other place to put points. That's about all we have. Right. That's it. Saltua is coming back this week. He is. I know. It's good to see he's back. Sunday night game against the Steelers. Hopefully none the worse for wear. He says he's feeling good. Second and ten. Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. And again, he got some action. Just give the five back. Yeah. It's Hurst. False start. Offense. Number 76. Five-yard penalty. Still second down. Since the clock will stop, there's no 10-second runoff. Clock with stops and no 10-second runoff there.
