 At Arrowhead Stadium. You don't see that. The play clock went to zero. So, you ever seen that? You've been calling games for a few years. Dave Toll, who's one of the best special teams coaches ever, it's a new kicker. For some reason, I don't know, I didn't see the breeze blow the ball off the tee or whatever, but anyway, Amendola, who was with the Jets last year, got released. he was in the Houston camp for a few games or a couple of days anyway and now he's signed in the absence of Buckner who they hope to have back by week three kick fielded at the floor by DeAndre Carter and Carter Wiggins is ready with the ball out the ball is out and the Chiefs are there at the they're going to say he's down he was down by contact the crowd of course is in an uproar right now. Amendola comes up with the ball. Hussey checking, but the signal was that he was down by contact. He better hope so. The ruling on the field as the runner was down by contact. First down, Los Angeles. All right, a closer look. Yeah, that's why they brought DeAndre Carter in. Let's see if that left knee is down. Well, it looks like, yeah, he is down clearly before that ball comes out. Yep. Good call by the official. Nothing more to look at. Chargers take over to 33. He's the knee down. And Carter, he's a specialist, but with the injury to Allen, he stepped up in a big way last week and will have to make some plays tonight. Had a TD reception. Herbert off the fake. Keeps his eyes downfield. That pass is incomplete intended for Joshua Palmer to be second down and 10. Keenan Allen, as we told you, is out tonight. Hamstring. So most completions to a receiver in the quarterback's first two seasons in NFL history. Manning to Marvin Harrison, 174. Their second, Herbert to Allen, on top. You're losing your go-to guy on the road. and he's off to a heck of a start, mainly by Mike Williams stepping in. Second and ten. To the outside again. Pass is high, but leaping and making the grip. Mike Williams, we mentioned, has only caught two last week. Wasn't a big part of the game plan. Tonight already, Williams has six catches. And look what Spagold is doing here as he's rolling up on it. You know, he's up tight. They go no huddle here, and Eckler bangs his way for a first down up to the 45. They're doing everything they can to stop Mike Williams. Almost every catch that he's made, he's dealing with a corner pressing him up in his face, but they're still going after that matchup against a rookie, Jalen Watson. George is doing a good job, varying the pace. And no huddle there. Back conventionally here. Inside handoff. Eckler went to western Colorado, grew up on a ranch in Colorado where he rode bulls with his mother. He did. Trust me. That's one way to get yourself ready to become an NFL running back, right? A little unconventional, but effective in his case. Helps your balance, doesn't it? It does. And your toughness. Right. Which is exactly what he has as a back. That was no bull, by the way. Never mind. Second and six. Eckler again. Nice little cut back there. And gets Simeon. Oh, boy. And then pays the price. About a yard and a half shy. Nick Bolton taking over in the middle, number 32. They let Anthony Hitchens go. And Bolton's now the main man holding the defensive signals. Yeah, we've talked so much about Tyreek Hill not being in Kansas City any longer, but Tyron Matthew not being in Kansas City has really affected this defense with some of the changes they have made. Bolton has kind of taken over as the leader in this defense, especially up in the front. Communicates, does well, and is known for his instincts and physicality. Second-year man played his college football down the road in Columbia at Missouri. fires and that's incomplete a little behind Palmer got a hand up couldn't bring it in and it will be fourth down and let's see what Mr. Staley wants to do here for the moment he's going to send in the punt group he ends up going after Snead who's again very very good in coverage had a cushion just put floats one to the end zone Williams off the back shoulder and incomplete he looks around for a flag There is none. Legereus Steve blitzed on that. They have the rookie on him as well, Jalen Watson out of Washington State, picked in the seventh round. They're minus Trent McGuffey, who was picked in the first round. He's hurt. Inactive tonight. Off the play fake. Sets up the screen. Caught. But right there, Austin Eckler gets buried by Willie Gay as he makes the catch. It'll be third down and long. Boy, did Willie Gay feel this the entire time. Chris Jones does a good job of getting the pressure. But Gaze is sitting back there waiting. Just waiting to see if this is a screen. He's almost getting out there before Eckler even has a chance to catch the ball. Once he does, he's there to make the tackle. Nice play. Crowd back at full throat. Now on the third and 13. Silent count. Play clock winding down. Herbert surveys, shoots it underneath. Nice move there by Gerald Everett, the former Ram, played last year with the Seahawks. Doesn't get the first down, but sets up what should be an easier field goal attempt, unless, of course, you've got Brandon Staley, who loves to go for it on fourth down, but here he won't. Has that reputation, right? Last year, 34 attempts on fourth down, which is as many as you'd see in this league. But I think he's got a better team this year, which doesn't make him maybe feel that he needs to go for it as often. Dustin Hopkins, the Chargers have had terrible kicking problems for a decade. He may have solved them last year. Came over from Washington, did a good job, wins the job this year. 31-yard attempt. And the Los Angeles Chargers are on the board. A couple of six under six minutes to go in the court. Apparently not retired. Tyreek Hill's number means you've got Pacheco wearing his number 10. There he is. Sorry folks, he's up there with the Dawson and Lemire and Bobby Bell at all the rest. And he lets that one steal through the end zone. So we talked about Mahomes, we were talking to him yesterday and he talked about bringing all of the guys down to his home near Fort Worth and they were there for about two weeks. Yeah, and you're not talking about four or five guys. You're talking about 18 to 20 guys. And I think it talks about the leadership of Patrick Mahomes now in his fifth year as a starting quarterback. And he said going to dinner and just hanging out and developing chemistry, getting to know each other probably had as much to do with that as working on the actual offense and the scheme. Well, he's the real deal. It's just him. Clyde Edwards, a layer for a game of three. Let's go to Kaylee. So, Al, when all the running backs and receivers and tight ends took Mahomes up on that invite to Texas and put this team first, Travis Kelsey told me it really set the tempo for this year, the selflessness he saw. He told me it gave him the reassurance that all these guys are on the same page. Yeah, when Kelsey shows up, you know that everybody's bought in, right? Yeah. If 87's there, you better be there. Go five wide here on second down and seven. Chargers blitz, and they get him right up the middle. Drew Tranquil, number 49, and Khalil Mack is there as well. Tranquil had an interception last week, and, of course, Mack had three sacks in the opener. Yeah, a little miscommunication up front on that right side of the offensive line. They didn't hide it. Tranquil's right up at the line of scrimmage. You can see Trey Smith, the right guard, actually steps down to his left, creating that opening, and he just shoots that gap between Smith and the right tackle, Wiley, for an easy interception. Nothing Mahomes could do there, or a sack there. Mahomes' last season was blitzed only 15% of the time. That's about one every seven dropbacks. Third and 16. And they blow that play up in the backfield. Derwin James is right there to take care of McKinnon as he makes the grab. And it's fourth down on a very fast three and out. Yeah, it is really hard on this offensive line when you have Derwin James right here. He's just kind of sitting and waiting and eyeing McKinnon, who's known as a back who typically they throw the ball to. So he's locked in on him. You can see the rest of that defense is there. Not fooled at all on third down that they go to the screen. Not often did the Chiefs punt twice in the first 11 minutes of the game. But Tommy Townsend sends it skyward here for the second time. This is Carter. Mile high kick. And Carter wiggles his way out to the 42 yard line. To be the elite quarterback in this league. He's from the 42 yard line. Back field was empty. Pass is caught. Eight-yard gain. So Mike Williams, already a big part of the action. Again, tuned in late. Keenan Allen, their number one receiver. Hamstring strain last week. Can't play tonight. Maybe with a long week now. Ten days before the next game, he can't play tonight. Let's hope so. But what I like to see from Joe Lombardi as a play caller is he's moving Mike Williams around. He's filling that void. And they're attacking the interior of the zone here from Kansas City. just sitting down in that soft spot. Second and two to the outside, and it's going to be a throwback here to Eckler, but that's going to be blown up in the backfield. So DeAndre Carter, a little razzle-dazzle, but they should have erased that one from the playbook. It's a loss of four. Yeah, we just talked about Joe Lombardi and what a great job they're doing here, and then they throw a ball that looks like it's just too slow and developing. Very fortunate that Eckler came back to the ball. Kansas City's shown great discipline there on that second down play. Dangerous. Barry. Third and six. Two and a half left in the opening quarter. Herbert fires, and that's going to be caught close to a first down. Williams spinning around. Did he get it? Let's see where they mark it. Looking at the yellow line, which, by the way, is unofficial in case you're wondering. You have to mention that at least once a year, right? What a throw here. And I love that he went to the matchup. He went to the rookie with his best receiver tonight, Williams. Comes up just a little bit short. But you understand why he wanted to try to get that matchup. And even though his tight coverage is rolled up on him, he still makes that throw. actually going to bring out the sticks here. Looks to be a little short. Pretty good effort there after the catch. Very. Fight for that first down. Yep. Game of inches. Wow. And links. Yeah. All right, so now you've got the first decision. Brandon Staley last year going for it look there's a fine line between aggressiveness and recklessness sometimes it worked last year other times it did not I think they're confident with how their defense has played here in these first couple of drives right around midfield they bring in their heavy unit next gen stats right there powered by AWS put a fullback in Zando Horvath. The Chiefs expecting a quick huddle here. They're already down and ready in the interior. At the 48. Sonny Michel is the running back. He's the eye back here. And Herbert's going to keep it himself and pick up the first down. So Brandon Staley begins the year one for one. There you go. So much for the drama there. That was pretty quick. He just got under center and took it. It's pretty nice having a 6'6 quarterback and a center that's as good as there is. Everybody tries to get low, and the big man just goes right over top of his center. Easy first down. Herbert on third and one or fourth and one, and it's through a 13 out of 14, picking up the first down in those situations. Michelle stays in the game. former Patriot on a Super Bowl ring with the Rams last year. And Sonya Michelle cuts it back turns it into a nice run picks up about 7 to the 40 where Willie Gay makes the tackle. Great vision here by Michelle and a heck of a job by the back side of this offensive line getting a push. Watch how important those back side blocks are. That play is designed to go to the left. The combination of the vision by Michelle the right side of that offensive line getting a good push down. Open that up for positive yards. Final minute of the quarter on the second down and three. Good protection. Going deep downfield. And a battle is won there with a flag thrown by Mike Williams with Fenton covering on the play. Flag comes in. If it's against Kansas City, it's at the one-yard line. And it is. And the push is there. So Jones makes his biggest play of the night. Now he can't beat the rookie, so they move him to the other side against Filer. And this is what you're used to seeing. Oh, my gosh. The sudden movement for a man of his size at 6'6". Well, you know, he used to eat nothing but junk food. Then he told us he's eating healthy. He's a foodie right now. He's giving us this by-play, play-by-play yesterday. I bought it, too, until I saw him on a McDonald's commercial on the news last night. Short kick. They're caught up at the 35-yard line by Sky Moore. So you had J.K. Scott with a short kick. He was pinned up against the back line of the end zone. Gar in your punting game. Two three and outs in a row for the Chargers. A poor punt. Now you give Mahomes incredible field position here. And you would say you're in field goal shape right now with Butker, but who knows with Amendola. Right. Three tight ends in this set. Pressure put on from behind. Gets it away, and that's incomplete. You had Khalil Mack come in the great circle route to force it. You know, who's had a quiet night, and you expect that to maybe change, is Kelsey. You know, usually in these situations in the game, this is where Mahomes starts to look for 87, right? Even if Derwin James, it's a great matchup. If James is on him, he's got to get separation. He's got to win, right? He's an elite player. But I wouldn't be shocked here in this drive. Late in the game, he's been quiet. Try to get him going here. Yeah, only three cashes for 33 yards. Second down and 10. They flare it out to Edwards-Alaire, and that is read beautifully by Asante Samuel Jr. Dad, of course, played for many years with New England and Philadelphia. Had a great career. Sitting back again with two safeties, back deep. Puts a lot of pressure on these corners to have to react and make plays up close, make tackles. Big emphasis this week by Brandon Staley. We're going to sit and make everything go in front, but we cannot allow them to catch the ball and get yards after the catch. Put a lot on these linebackers and corners to make plays like that. Third and ten. Hardman is back in the game for the Chiefs. Mahomes stepping up. Fires. And that's low. And is it caught? They say yes by Hardman. Brought it in. Well-designed play with a spacing from Andy Reid to give Mahomes a chance. And Hardman's able to sit in here. Sits back. Just kind of sits right here. Right in between. You got all this spacing. You got a linebacker. You got the nickel. You got his corner. Everybody's spread out. Creates a nice hole there. And Hardman just settles in just a yard or two past the sticks. And Mahomes puts it right on him for the first. Needed 10. Got 11. Two and a half to go. Empty backfield. Go four by one. Four receivers up at the top. And you've got a flag here. Delay again. Offense. Five-yard penalty. Big person 15 now. Andy Reid, a beautiful mind. A beautiful football mind. He's worked some magic through the years. Last week he came out in Arizona. He's running plays you've never seen before. I mean, he obviously has that West Coast background, but he's so willing to change and adjust his team. Mahomes rolling against the green. It's juggled and pulled in by Watson. He scored the touchdown to make it a 17-14 game. Usually when you see stacked receivers, you think the man behind has that cushion. But here, look at that throw again. Shortstop making a play. Ground ball over the pitcher. He goes over the shortstop, makes that throw, flips it. He'd have been a great baseball player. His father, of course. Oh, yeah. Pitch for years. Yeah. Many of those with the twins. I think he and Herbert, their first love was baseball. It sounds like it. Yeah. Used to be. Yeah, well, yeah. Until at least Pat signed his contract. Right. Second and six. Look out. Gets away. Throws. Finds the open man. You're talking about Kelsey. And he gets down at the tube. Did the ball come out? Did the ball come out before the tackle? Meanwhile, it's in the end zone, and it's Bryce Callahan who comes up with the ball. So Kelsey trying to work his way into the end zone, and they've got to call him down by contact. Of Hardman to get outside. Boy, he is so strong. Again, another guy you think about his ability to rush the quarterback. They have two edge players in Mack and Bosa that take just as much pride in defending the run. Tommy Townsend in to punt. DeAndre Carter, who's been in nine camps and has played in games with five different teams over the years and had a touchdown reception last week, is going to let this one bounce. Inside the five and can it be saved? It cannot. It's a touchback. And so the Chargers will get the ball at the 20. Here comes Justin Herbert. Going through his progressions, and it's a nine-yard pickup to Mike Williams, who was seldomly used last week. Caught only two balls, but they go right to him tonight in the absence of Keenan Allen. Yeah, and as you just said, watch him work the progressions. Anytime he throws, he'll start right. Look at the feet. Gets in perfect position. How about the location of the ball? Low and away. Eyes come back to that third target. Away from LeJarius Sneed. Perfect throw there on first and ten. Second and one. Off the play action. Good protection. Fires. Caught up at the 44-yard line. And that is caught by Williams. He's already made as many catches in the first couple of minutes of this game as he did all of last Sunday. Here's Herbert now. Some of his numbers. Third year in the league. He's been in here twice. And what's happened? He's won both times. Seven touchdowns through the air and one on the ground. No picks. To the left he goes. He throws it away. He was under pressure that time from Leo Chennault, a rookie out of Wisconsin. Second and ten. Yeah, just confused on the right side of that offensive line, and really that's going to be the question tonight for Herbert and the Chargers. Can that right side hold up? You've got a rookie in Zion Johnson out of Boston College and Pipkins who took over for the first time. Eckler, and Austin takes it to the 48-yard line. But Austin Eckler, I mean, a guy who's very much under the radar around the National Football League. Been there for a while, but last year, 20 touchdowns, which tied with Jonathan Taylor of Indianapolis for the league lead. Yeah, he works as hard as anybody. Another guy that's got a low center of gravity. Catches the ball, pass protection, just a complete back. And, again, with Keenan Allen down, you're going to see his workload step up, especially in a passing game. That was a gain of eight. Third and two. hangs in the pocket, fires, that's caught, and that takes it to the 35 in a first half for DeAndre Carter. Great story. This guy's been around, in and out of camps, five different teams, as I said before, and played a big part in the game last week. Yeah, here they just do a nice job of attacking the zone. You have a young rookie corner in Watson, 35. One guy goes over the top, another underneath. Watson sits, no problem, third and short. The easy throw underneath. Pick up the first down. New running back here is Joshua Kelly. They've got Eckler. They've got Kelly and Sonny Michel now with the Chargers as well. Give it to Kelly. Slips through that hole of a right guard. Inside the 30. Tackled by Carlos Dunlap. Several years on Andy Reid's staff. Herbert to the outside. And that pass in front of Joshua Taylor. And incomplete. A little off target right there. It's third down and three. So far, the Chargers doing a pretty good job of giving Herbert time to throw. That'll be one of the few throws that you see from him that'll be off target. Had an open man out there, but really looks to be settled in and throwing in rhythm until that throw, third and short. You ever wonder about Herbert? That drive he led in the fourth quarter and in overtime against Vegas last year at the end of the season, off the charts. Third and three. Four-man rush. Has time and then falling down and giving the flag. So that'll be interference. That is Joshua Palmer. The contact from Rashad Fenton. And that we'll hear from John Hussey officially should result in the first down. Pass interference. Defense. Number 27. Ball he plays is far to the foul. Automatic. You talk about working through progressions with Herbert. He ended up going back all the way to his fourth target. Ends up trying to get the ball to Palmer. There's a tight coverage and again grabs onto that jersey. An easy call. But the rookie right guard, Zion Johnson, is going up against Chris Jones. One of the top interior pass rushers in the entire league holds his own there. Rookie first-round pick is Johnson out of Boston College. So the Chargers won the toss. They have deferred. Dustin Hopkins will kick off. And Isaiah Pacheco, a rookie seventh-round pick out of Rutgers, who was their leading rusher last week, will return it. So each team with a victory on opening day. And off we go from Kansas City with a touchback. Patrick Mahomes in the division. how tough has he been in the AFC West. There it is. 21-3. A 4-1 touchdown to interception ratio and a rating in triple figures. Important for him tonight. Settle in. Get the ball out of his hands quickly with this rush. Last week or Sunday in Arizona scored on his first three possessions. Three touchdown passes. He used a lot of motion. Hardman is the motion man here. Give it to Clyde Edwards-Alaire. And he picks up about five. So last week, on that first touchdown throw, he sprained his left wrist. It is taped tonight. You can see it. But how much did it bother him? He only threw four more touchdown passes after that. And he told us in our meeting yesterday, first day after, it hurt a little bit. By the second and third day, he felt good to go. He said it wouldn't matter. He was playing no matter what. Edwards-Alaire again. and with that second burst he's able to pick up the first down so they give it to him twice he scored two touchdowns last week on pass receptors they may mark it a little bit short and they do looked like he was able to thrust across the 35 yard line but he did not so it'll be third down and one and he read feels really good about Clyde Edwards-Hilaire and what he can bring in his third year he's had an entire offseason of being healthy brings a physicality even though he's undersized He's thick and low center of gravity. Look at Joey Bosa. He and Mack, the formidable tandem on the outside. Give it to the up man, and that's Michael Burton, the fullback. So three straight runs for the Chiefs and a first down. And remember, this Chargers defense talked about trying to get more physical up front. Made a lot of moves. Khalil Mack, when you think about him as a pass rusher, but one of the best edge defenders against the run. They were 30th in the league last year against the run, so made a lot of moves. And the Chiefs testing that here early in those first three plays. Mahomes' first pass of the night. Set up a little bit of a screen. Cuts back inside. Does Edwards a layer and is close to a first down. Containment to the outside. Cut back inside. And we'll see where they mark it. Good job here by the center, Creed Humphrey. Watch him get out. Very athletic center. really controls things up front doesn't sell it too early then he does a nice job on a kickout block and that you don't need to give Clyde Edwards Hilaire much room really good acceleration and here he is again looking it up good kickout block right there on Kenneth Murray gives him plenty of room to pick up that first down free second round draft choice last year out of Oklahoma Helped to cement that offensive front That was a big priority for Kansas City going into last season Off the fake, rolling left, dumps it underneath, settles for a pass to Burton, who did step out of bounds, tried to cut back inside. Steps out after a very short game, gained a two, it'll be second down and eight. You know, you and I talked about this last week, Eric Bien-Ami and Andy Reid, This offense, they faced a lot of blitzing, a lot of man-to-man, and they were licking their chops, had a big day. Today, they know they're going to have to be more patient. Much like last year, people sat back, kept their safeties deep, forced. This offense and Patrick Mahomes have to be more patient. I think that'll be the story tonight. Kelsey flares out, leaps up, makes the catch, his first catch of the night. Had a great game last week. Of course, he's been fantastic for the last seven seasons going to the Pro Bowl. Derwin James makes the tackle. The layer will be third down and short. And that's the matchup we want to see, right? I mean, Derwin James, one of the top most versatile players in the NFL. He's going to be matched up one-on-one quite a bit. Gets over a little bit late, which allows Kelsey to get to the outside. That will be a matchup, a game within the game, as Mahomes trying to dial up Kelsey against James. He plays all over the field. In the box, outside, deep. Give the ball here to Hardman. and Hardman's stuffed in the backfield at the 46-yard line. That's Joey Bosa trailing him on the outside and knocking him down there. It'll be fourth down, and in comes the punting unit. Yeah, tough ask for Kelsey, as good as he is, to try to hold the point here. All you're going to see, getting the ball to the outside, he's got to hold that edge. Hold that edge. You cannot allow the speed. Looking down an eight. That's caught on the run and busting his way out of a tackle. Edwards-Alaire to the Los Angeles 41-yard line in the first down. And when teams do this, Mahomes is doing what he should do. You've got to have yards after the catch. Blitz the middle linebacker, easy opening underneath, and it's one thing to catch it. Now you've got to break away from Derwin James, pull away from Drew Tranquil, and pick up some really good yards. So that's the answer. Running the football underneath throws, and then your receivers and running backs and tight ends making some things happen and breaking some tackles for you. McKinnon in the backfield. Surveying. Pressured. And just flips that one away. And the punter makes the catch on the sideline. Second down. Just a great rush here. Nobody gets out of their lanes. Everybody, you know, you get a good push here initially in the inside by Morgan Fox. But everybody kind of doing their job. Rumpf to the left. Doesn't allow him to break contain. Forces him into the boundary. Just nothing that the Holmes could do. Great group effort rushing as a defensive unit. And very little blitzing. Second and ten. Hardman is back in the game after he's limped off. The blue and it's up. That's fired and a little bit behind. Hardman, who I just mentioned, back in the game, third and ten. We check in with Kaylee again. Al, Hardman looked to be in a lot of pain when he came limping off the field, but they taped up his left heel. They put some padded heel cups right to his skin. We saw him slip that shoe back on, work it out. And as a sprinter, he's going to be on his toes a lot, but changing direction, that's when he's going to be putting more pressure on his heel. Look out for that. Kaylee just came off the field. It's a one play, and he says, I need to be checked out here. Justin Watson comes in in his place. Third and ten. This time they send an extra man. Mahomes gets away to the end zone. Caught! Watson! Touchdown! he beats Jackson and this is the guy who comes into the game because Hardman came out of the game on that play he's got a great chemistry with Patrick Mahomes the difference here is they allowed him to step up in the pocket this is 1-on-1 he turns J.C. Jackson the premier corner in the NFL It's a heck of a route there to get him to turn. But credit the offensive line for giving him enough room to step up. Bosa went wide. We just talked about a team rush. That time they didn't. Hammond Dolan's kick is good to convert. Watson with his first touchdown since he played with the Bucs back in 2019. So they get a break on the overturned interception. Cash in. 17-14. List. Back to the touchdown we go. Yeah, we just talked about how they rushed as a unit. This time they didn't. You get pressure on the outside. You get a blitz right here. But watch how the lanes open up and allow Mahomes. They haven't blitzed much. When they do, he makes them pay for it. Look at him look right. Comes back to the left and sees a one-on-one matchup. Gets it to Watson. Watch him now. He just flips his thing. Typical Mahomes. Give him room. 45 yards. A little flip of the wrist. Touchdown, Chiefs. That's already seven touchdown passes for him in a game in almost three quarters. Chargers start with Sonny Michel as the running back. They used Eckler, Kelly, and Michel in that role tonight. And the former Patriot and Ram picks up two. Place coming alive here a little bit on Herbert. They've done a good job of mixing their tempos. He's been under center. He's been in the gun. Different formations. Joe Lombardi calling a heck of a game tonight for this Chargers offense. Leaning on Herbert. They run the hurry up. And that's caught. And set a third and short. Chris Jones, the great defensive tackle for Kansas City. Haven't really called his name tonight. He had the one deflected pass. The rookie from Boston College, John Johnson, doing a really good job Against one of the top interior players in the league. Zion Johnson. And that will be incomplete. Justin Reed breaks it up. Came over from the Texans. Eckler. Stop. Just about at the line of the scrimmage. And that's Carlos Dunlop. The longtime Bingler crawls his way out of the action. they're rotating some defensive linemen in. They want to stay fresh and healthy, and Dunlop's a big part of that. Again, another guy that's a great pass rusher, but really good inside move there. Used quickness in his hands to get inside of Pipkin's, able to collapse down. Four minutes to halftime. second and nine look out Herbert gets it away before he gets hit and that will be a first down Joshua Palmer Willie Gay came in that time got to Herbert but too late and a first down for Los Angeles they showed man to man before the snap and then they brought pressure right here they're showing man to man they bring pressure and look how far back the safety is once they bring that pressure one of the things that you'll see Herbert do is recognize post snap reads and get the ball to the right man, felt the pressure, and got the ball out just before Willie Gay could get to him. Back to the ground. Short game. Eckler. Second down and eight. This is, you know, it's early in the season. Nobody's going to win anything tonight. But this is a pretty big game in the sense that for the Chargers their schedule is pretty easy down the road Meanwhile the Chiefs open the season with eight teams that had winning records right through it's much much tougher than is the Chargers Let's mention divisional game Second and eight Kelly is the running back they give it to him they're going to maintain his balance and again you know this division is so tough at AFC West but I know it's early obviously yeah the season is 20 minutes old but the team that the team that wins tonight's game will be the only undefeated team in the division I'm with you and I think you're looking at maybe the more complete teams at least on paper in this division so when you go head to head with the Chargers and the Chiefs this year it's very important no matter when what point in the season you're playing This Chargers team, they've reshuffled the deck, made a lot of changes, and they have come into this game and this season with a lot of confidence. Why wouldn't you? Not just with Herbert, but the changes they made on defense. Two-minute warning, a special look now at what's apps. A third down and one. Two minutes to the half. Herbert keeping his eyes downfield. Can he get away? No, he cannot. And he's taken down at the 47-yard line. And so now, with Carlos Dunlop there, it is going to be... Well, it's a heck of a call here with Patrick Mahomes on the other sideline. Right. Fourth and two. We'll see what Staley wants to do. Yeah. And I think it's because of who he's playing and the way his team is up right now, 10-7. Right. You would normally think he would go for this, but no way. You don't want to give Mahomes if you don't make it that field position. Well, you know, it's kind of funny. Andy Reid could take a timeout here as well. Yeah. But, you know... Remember, the Chargers defer. They get the ball to start the second half. They were thinking about points there and then getting the ball back. The two for one. J.K. Scott. This point on the field. They could have taken the delay. It wouldn't have mattered. But they get it away. Moore is back there. Let's it bounce at the five. And it takes a good, a fairly good Los Angeles bounce. At least it doesn't go into the end zone. It's down inside the 15. Randy Reed could have taken the timeout there. Makes you wonder what they're going to do here now, back inside their own 15. But I think we're all kind of surprised. They didn't use that timeout, save a little time. They have all three for what it's worth right now. The home starts this one from the 13-yard line. And the pressure is on, and the pass is thrown into the Chiefs bench. And you've got a flag at the 6-yard line. I think it's going to be on Bosa. He came in, submarined him. Obviously, they take care of these quarterbacks. Joey Bosa is off to really a big night. Holding offense number 77. He pulled the defender into the quarterback. Half the distance of the goal. Friendly fire. Grabs his jersey and actually pulls him down. I thought it might have just been Bosa losing his balance at the end. but you can clearly see Wiley, who's got his hands full against Bosa, watch near the end of this, grabs that jersey, and you couldn't quite see that. That was an interesting look at it there. Watch here. He gets a hold of the jersey there, and then you don't really see him pull him down. Well, the crowd let you know what they think. Terry McCauley is telling us, shaky, shaky call. First and 16 now. Juggling catch is made. That's Juju Smith-Schuster up at the 11-yard line, and they'll race up to the line here. With a 12 yards to go on second down, and that catch is made and then spun out as Valdez-Scantling, so it'll be third down now. The clock stopped with 27 seconds. Of course, Andy Reid has such confidence in Mahomes, but it does make me go back to that fourth down at midfield when they allowed some time to go off. You're looking at 27 seconds. They have not done a good job of getting the ball thrown downfield against his defense who's just sitting back and keeping everything in front. Stopping here and Stanley can call the timeout. That's right. Third and six. Four-man rush again. Mahomes and that's incomplete and so you've got 22 seconds and the Chargers don't even have to take it down no they don't crowd still upset about the penalty Andy trying to figure it out too talking to Carl Johnson who at one time was the head of officials in the National Football League. Brown is still exercised. Meanwhile, Townsend with his fourth punt. And letting it bounce. And that's going to take us almost to halftime. Six seconds. And we're back in 30 seconds. You saw the Chiefs punt four times in a half, right? Kneel down will end it. The Chargers get the ball to start the second half. And you know what? Entertaining first half. Brandon Staley up 10-7 on the road. Yep. He'll take that. Coming up after the break, the Mercedes-Benz half. So Matt Amendola to kick off the newly acquired kicker. And he boots that one through the end zone for a touchback a couple of minutes ago When he came out of the locker room, Haley talked to Brandon Staley. Coach, you kept Arrowhead pretty quiet for a quarter. What is the key to continuing to keep Patrick Mahomes and his offense from getting downfield? We just got to play team defense. We got to have all three levels playing together. We got to play a lot of people, stay fresh. It's going to take everybody in order to finish this. Your offense scored on the first two drives. How do you get them going again? Yeah, I like the way we played offensively. I feel like we're moving the ball at a high level. I think the best thing that we're doing is we're really secure with the football right now. We've got to keep doing that. And I think if we do that, that'll be a big thing for us in the second half. So they start from the 25. Meanwhile, you've got Will Clapp now in its center. So Corey Lindsley does not make the start here in the second half. Have to check on that. Got a silent count going, and there he is. That's something to keep an eye on. Corey Lindsley, one of the top centers in the NFL and one of the best run-blocking centers. Second and eight. They go quickly nice catch a contested catch a yard shy of the first down Gerald Everett tackle there by Willie Gay third and one Gives him a chance here. He had a Frank Clark closing in on him. We're gonna go tempo here, but a nice job of changing his arm angle Eckler can he get the first yes, he can Say what you're going you're going tempo. You got a new center in there silent guy You've got a lot of stuff going on right now. When you get like this, you feel like you're doing a Big 12 game, going back to these college games that I do. The tempo is fast, and one of the things that puts a lot of pressure on a defense to communicate, make sure everybody's gaps sound, especially on third down for Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator here in Kansas City. Thank God they don't shut the clock after every first down. You'll be here in midnight. I know. Tell me about it. I live it. Yes. From the 41-yard line, Herbert looks back. The other way. Dangerous pass, but gets away with it. And Eckler has a lot of room to roam. And finally gets taken out of bounds after a long game. Got away from Willie Gay. Dangerous pass, but it works. Game with the ball behind him. Just not able to connect with Palmer. He puts it out in front. It's a first down. So J.K. Scott had a great game against the Raiders last week. Former Packer. Played only sparingly last year at the end of the year at Jacksonville. You've got Sky Moore, the rookie, calling for and making the fair catch at the 8-yard line. Resulted in a touchdown to make it a three-point game. Off we go on this drive from the 8-yard line. Edwards-Alaire back in the green. Picks up about four. Bosa makes the tackle. Again, does such a complete player off the edge for the Chargers. Works through some traffic here. Kind of comes off Kelsey initially. And then off of the block by Burton. Watch his eyes. Watch his feel. Knows coming right at him. And the best thing he does, not only make the play, but he forces it back into the teeth of that Chargers defense. For the Knicks with the 49ers, a star in his own run. Second and six. Mahomes, they keep him in the pocket Slings one to Kelsey He spins away and picks up the first down Got away from Jackson to pick up the first On a gain of nine yards Up to the 21 Pretty good job here at protection You see five up front Creates one-on-one matchups Somebody's going to win Mack to the right Bosa to the left Nice little window there to kind of step up A little lane to step up and make that throw Mack here trying to get home off the edge gets a little push there from Trey Smith Bosa almost gets in go five wide here four man rush again Harden spinning around turns a three yard game into about an eight yard game tackled by Bryce Callahan second down and two We talked about in the open last week the Cardinals blitzed him, played a lot of man, and they were able to be very aggressive and get down the field. Last year, everybody sat back, made them be patient. They knew coming in tonight against a Stanley coach defense, it's going to be more like last year. Be patient, run the football, work the intermediate and short passes, and eventually you can work back to being explosive. Mahomes, as you saw, 10 of 11 for 88 yards. and he will try to fight for the first down but come up short two tranquilers there to stop him a yard shy of the first down third down see Bosa again kind of setting that edge Trey Smith pulling around the right guard along with Wiley the right tackle he blows his play up kind of puts his foot in the ground knows it's leverage right there and that frees up tranquil those pulling linemen could not get up to the backer because of what Bosa did. Forces his third and short. Pacheco is the eye back. Give it to him. And it depends on the spot, but the Chargers are pretty sure they've stopped him, and they have. Tranquil is there again. Well, this is what Staley's defense wants to do. Get more physical with the line of scrimmage. Eat up the offensive linemen and free up your linebackers. Look at all the action up front. All of this allows him to kind of clean it up. Get physical, get stout at the point of attack, and let those backers get downhill and make a play. Great job. So you look at the third down play. Tranquil. The assist, of course, by Bosa. And then they come up with a big stop there. Going to a great start. This season had a terrific day against Las Vegas. So Townsend already with his third punt of the night. Sky high again. and backing up at the 12-yard line is Carter. Avoids the first guy and then brings it back out to the 23-yard line. After a 60-yard line, along with the commissioner, on hand tonight. Rolling and throwing is Herbert, and that's close to a first down, Joshua Palmer. That's a power couple up there. I would say so. You and Mr. Bezos getting to the bottom of things last night. I think you guys were figuring some of the issues out in this world. He didn't know how to play craps. One of the great mathematical minds in history. Can't figure that out. I'll teach. First down up at the 33-yard line. And it's fourth down. We just talked about Zion Johnson going up against Chris Jones. We wondered coming in how he would hold up. 77 right there in the middle gives his quarterback enough time. But give credit to the Chiefs on the back end. Anticipating a short throw and Reed, a veteran, does a nice job of coming up. Times it up perfectly against Gerald Everett. J.K. Scott sends it into the night air. A fair catch call for Mabe by Sky Moore at the 30-yard line. 6-24 left in the third. A three-point game in Kansas City in high school and college. What an impressive, sharp, young head coach that has a lot of confidence in his team. Great leader. One of the four guys already off the Sean McVay coaching tree. Play fake, play action. and Valdez-Skeedling makes the catch here. You see this where it's not called in the huddle. They've got a run play with an alert. If he sees a soft corner, how many times have you seen 15 do that? He's just looking at that. Offensive line, they're blocking a run. They have no idea that Mahomes is going to pull out of there and see that. Instead of running that play, pick up an easy seven or eight yards by just flipping it out to your receiver with a soft coverage. Second and three. Cutting it back. Keeps those links going, but Edwards-Aliar does not have enough for the first down. So it'll be third down, about a yard and a half. Chargers coming in tonight trying to make Mahomes and his Chiefs offense one-dimensional. Talked about him earlier. Khalil Mack known as his pass rush ability. Three sacks last week against the Raiders. But when you talk to him, he's probably more excited and proud to talk about his ability to defend the run than rush the quarterback. Good job of getting down, eyes in that backfield, and keeping him short of the first. Casey, three of seven on third down. Mahomes to the air. Off the fake. Throws too high and incomplete. Trying to get that one to Valdez. Scanling and helping to bust up that play was Kyle Van Noy. Yeah, this is what you've got to deal with, whether it's Derwin, James, or Van Noy. You get caught up on third down of the edge, right? What are we going to do about Bosa? And all of a sudden, you've got to deal with this. You've got Mack on the edge, Bosa on the edge, and then you've got Van Noy, who's known as an edge guy in New England, but's been playing off the ball as a middle linebacker from time to time. Shows you his versatility, and he knows how to rush the quarterback. Townsend with his fifth punt. He'll lead the league in punting after this week. Averaging 57.3 tonight. in good measure thanks to that 74-yarder. He boots it a mile high. Fielded at the 9-yard line in Faircourt there by Carter. Justin Herbert's done a really good job without Keenan Allen of being able to find Mike Williams. Take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. We know that he can make contested catches downfield, but I think he felt a sense of pressure. He's got the big contract coming into this year. What's he been able to do? Win one-on-one matchups. Find the soft spot in the zone, and of course comes up with that touchdown. He's had a heck of a night, and he's going to have to finish strong if the Chargers want to get out of here with a win. And last punt by Townsend, 53 yards. Backs him up to the 9-yard line to begin this drive. Under 5 to play in the third. And Herbert has to get it away in a hurry, because that's the rookie out of Purdue, George Karlaftis, who forced that issue. These coaches love what they have seen from the rookie in camp. They think that he has a chance to be a major contributor and add depth. Eventually could become the guy. Watch his discipline to stay home. Knows there's that threat to the boot coming to the backside. Gets right into the face there of Herbert. Nothing Herbert can do other than just throw that ball away. Big fella out of Purdue. Now the crowd totally into it. second and ten off the fake look out from behind gets to the waves broken up Snead came in from the corner and helped to break that play up its third down and ten he wanted to throw that ball initially to the outside to Palmer who was coming in motion got him out in the flat he pumped pumped but I think just the presence of Watson preventing him from pulling the trigger. Snap it quickly to try to neutralize that crowd noise. Look out. Nearly a safety, but he gets out of the end zone. And Chris Jones. Thank you very much. Through the middle, pulling his weight. Gain of about six. Goes Pacheco, 5'10", 216, out of Rutgers. 62 yards on the ground last week. I'm kind of dumbfounded on how he slid all the way to the seventh round. When you look at his combine, he ran a 4-3-7, one of the fastest backs in Indianapolis. He's physical. Eric Bien-Ami, I was talking to him last night, he kind of giggled about how fortunate they were to get him late. And he had one of the best camps of any of the Chiefs as a rookie. Now McKinnon is the running back. Smith-Schuster was the man in motion. Sets up on the left. And Mahomes is going to go for six, and there's nobody there except a charger. However, a flag does come in. And that's Adderley for the moment. But the flag was thrown. You saw it come in. And the Chiefs are fairly confident it's against the Chargers. I think it was Bryce Callahan. John Hussey's going to check it out with the brethren. Marquez Valdez, Scantling on a route, just trying to work back to the outside. Kind of got locked up with him. Fire to the pass. Illegal contact. Defense. Number 23. That five-yard penalty will be enforced from the previous spot. Automatic. First down. Kansas City's thrown a lot of underneath throws, but this time they're trying to go downfield, and you can see that he gets tied up. I mean, they both did. The arm of Valdez gets around Bryce Callahan I think that why he was frustrated You see the pressure gets there The big fella Austin Johnson gets home Forces Mahomes to get rid of that ball probably a tick early than he like to Another one of the new guys, free agent. Had been with the Giants. First down now at the 34-yard line. McKinnon. Jerick McKinnon. Decent run. Gets stripped up by James. picks up about six second down let's go second down maybe five second and five early in this game kind of a conservative approach by Andy Reid now you're starting to see them try to get the ball and a couple times we've seen them getting the ball thrown downfield combination of running in the interior and challenging that Chargers the moves they've made along with that passing game downfield. Quick pass to the outside and taken down immediately. Noah Gray, one of the tight ends, and James is just all over the field. Makes the stop there. Andy was telling us the other day, he loves tight ends. Without injuries, he might have dressed four tight ends tonight. And again, I think that's, how do you fill that void with Tyree Killett's tight ends and also the receivers. Watch the motion, and then watch Tyree, or watch Derwin James, just kind of sneaking around. Not fooled at all. Sat there patiently, knew exactly what might be coming, and makes a good play. Third and four. Free play coming. Bosa was offside, and that is caught, and taking it inside the 10-yard line is Travis Kelsey. Mahomes with a free play. Good luck to the defense. Defense number 97. That penalty is a climb. 19-yard game. He's the best in the NFL at drawing defenders off sides and then getting that free play. What I am confused by is the Chargers losing Kelsey on a third down play. He does a good job of sitting down there, Yep. Get that free play. One of the best. Those are like Aaron Rodgers numbers on free plays. First and goal. Mahomes. Flushed out. Can't get him. Sidearms it for a touchdown. So you think you have him and then you don't. Avoids the tackle and then just throws a sidearm fastball for the touchdown. down. Jarek McKinnon from the nine-yard line. It's just, you kind of run out of adjectives the way he's able to keep this play alive. Tremendous athletic ability, but it's the vision. The eyes downfield and the sidearm to be able to make this play happen. Does it so often, but a good job of, these receivers know, when he does that, find the opening in the zone, and the offensive lineman, nobody goes downfield. Now the kicker is Matt Amendola because Harrison Bucker is hurt. So they signed him a couple of days ago. He boots the extra point. And early in the second quarter, it's a three-point game. And give credit to Willie Gay. Just didn't finish the play. Stayed home. Was not fooled at all. Really the only Chiefs defender that did not move with the action. And this is what makes Eckler so tough. He can catch the ball, but he's hard to bring down by one guy. Gay had a chance at him, but look at him. Shakes shows you how tough he is from riding those bulls you talked about growing up with his mom. Keeps that balance from the 41-yard line. Take it to Kelly, and then the pass is batted, trying to throw it to Kelly. Batted by Chris Jones. Second and ten. Fired, caught. That's Mike Williams inside the 30 and another charger first down. They're just feeling this when Kansas City is playing zone. Watch Mike Williams run and then just kind of sit there. The action takes the linebackers away, creates a nice lane there, and that's the zip that you see from Herbert along with the accuracy. That combination, as we've seen here in these first three years, from Herbert in this offense is a lethal combination. Mike Williams has really stepped up tonight. the absence of Keenan Allen. On the ground, cutting it back. Nice move there. Joshua Kelly, third year back, played his college ball at UCLA. We talked about that vision. We saw Michelle have a very similar run early in this game. Cuts back to the right. Nice job on the right side of sustaining those blocks. Here they go fast again. Kelly again. Looks like he's a little short. To Kaylee we go. Al, you don't see center Corey Lindsley in there with the Chargers. The team tells us they're looking into a knee injury, and he's questionable to return. Yeah, they've got Clapp in there right from the get-go. Number 76. He was a free agent pickup from the Saints in the offseason. It's the third and one. Knowing Staley, are you talking about four downs here? Yeah, and you wonder, do you go the conventional way with the sneak, or do you try to catch him off and hit a play-action pass? Corvette, the fullback, flip it back to Eckler, and Eckler fights his way. Does he get it? We'll see where they spot it. Got him inbounds. Looks to be a little bit short. That's Nick Bolton covering on the play. Good job of this getting turned back inside. Just on the edge there, Justin Reed forces it back, and nobody's able to climb up to Nick Bolton. He can get sideline to sideline in a hurry. The leader of that front keeps him short of the first. Right. And they will go for it. Line up anyway to do it. Fourth down, inches. Staley says, if nothing else, it's a mindset I want my team to have. We're going to be aggressive. Give it to Eckler. And he is able to fight his way across the line to gain. First down, Los Angeles. I think that's so important when he talks about having that spirit. You know, just an attitude to create a fearless approach. And, you know, we saw Brian Dable that worked out with the New York Giants this past weekend. Players feed off of their coaches believing in them. And this is big to keep this drive alive. Instead of settling for the field, go on the road up three. You keep it alive, you get in the red zone, and now you're trying to get six. Chargers have had the ball for five minutes This is the 11th play of this drive To the end zone he goes And can he one-handed in the end zone to Mike Williams Yes Mike Williams What a night signed a new long-term lucrative deal in the offseason, paying a huge dividend tonight. And he takes Snead to the outside, usually that slot corner. By the way, he's in phase. Pretty good coverage, kind of that slow release. But look at the location. Unbelievable catch to get the right hand down and makes that catch. But the location of the ball gives him a chance. Pretty tight coverage by Snead. Right hand, right buttock as well. Yeah. That's right. To paraphrase John Mann, one buttock equals two feet, right? You're inbounds. In this case, six points. Right. Hopkins for the extra points. So the Chargers come out of the gate with a new center. No problem. 11 plays, 75 yards. And the Chargers lead by 10 at Arrowhead. Oh, yeah. Passionate, right? and see if when the Royals won the World Series back in. The ball is underthrown. He's trying to work his way back, and it's going to definitely be on Kansas City here. What a heck of an effort. You talk about a guy that's off to a good start tonight for Brandon Staley, Mike Williams. Who was going to step up for Keenan Allen? It's Mike Williams so far. Boy, a heck of a job of coming back and making that play. 6'4", working against a guy who's 5'11". There are two fouls on the play, both by the same team. Holding, defense, number 27. That will be declined. Pass interference, defense, number 27, also declined. The result of play is a first down. That's your daily double right there for Fenton. Fenton, it's a tough matchup. You mentioned the size, play action. He's got all kinds of time, and he's just grabbing onto the jersey. Once he makes that cut to the outside, you can see he's very handsy the entire route. And then when he comes back, heads not turned back to the football. An easy call for the officials, but they don't need it with the catch. First and goal. Keep it on the ground. And stop just short showing him the show. That's luxurious Steve coming up from the corner to make sure he doesn't get in And that might take us to the end of the first quarter clock ticking down They'll change sides in a moment at 38 nice job of just filling in got to be aggressive He's one of the top slot corners in this league and really good job as a run defenders He shows you right there Chargers have a second down and goal at the one and a three-nothing lead Michelle stays in Tight formation Put the fullback in there now Horvath Little motion Off the fake, pass to the outside Caught, and that's Horvath A rookie out of Purdue Picked in the 7th round, and he's begun his NFL career With touchdowns in his first 2 games What a start for the Chargers They go with a heavy lineup here They bring in a tackle to set up as a tight end over here, Norton. But then they're going to go play action off of that. Give you the look that they're going to try to pound you, and then slip the fullback out into the flat. Horvath catches Kansas City off guard. Great job again by Lombardi, breaking a tendency there with that formation. And then the tight ends wide open out the flat for the touchdown. Dustin Hopkins for the extra point. Scott holding and the Chargers with a very impressive drive take a 10-3rd straight in this ballpark. You just know Mahomes is going to answer, right? I have a feeling. So Pacheco is back there. He's watched the first two sail over his head and make it to Hattrick here. So the Chargers with a lot of new guys defensively. That was where they placed the premium in the offseason. Joseph Day from the Rams. Van Noy's been around two-time Super Bowl champ. We talked about Mack. J.C. Jackson from the Patriots. And Bryce Callahan, slot corner, had a pick last week. So new guys on that side of the ball. Tom Telesco and the gang in Los Angeles said we've got to shore up that defense. Yeah, in defense of Tom Telesco and also what we've seen from Brandon Staley, They changed dramatically from where they were with Gus Bradley as the defensive coordinator to who they are now. Mahomes off the fake. Throws, and that's caught by Hardman. McColl Hardman, that time he had James blitzing the safety, but they were able to fend him off to give Mahomes just enough time, and that's a gain of 30. Again, we talked about he could be anywhere. It's like a where's Waldo. He's in the back. He's up tight. He's blitzing. He's in run support. He doesn't hide it, but Pacheco does a nice job. See, Mahomes, just enough to be able to step up, early play action down. You're able to get receivers downfield by keeping Pacheco in to pick up that blitz. Yeah, it's a nice play by a seventh-round rookie to take care of James. Mahomes 5-5 for 43, and that pass is incomplete. That's Asante Samuel covering Marquez Valdez, scantling the former Green Bay Packer. So much attention on Khalil Mack and he and Bosa being teamed up. Derwin James, who's one of the best players in this league. But I'll tell you, J.C. Jackson, the corner who they picked up, you put him on the other side of Asante Samuel, this is a complete defense. Talking to Richard Sherman, who's on the pregame show, he's made it very clear. He thinks J.C. Jackson's the top corner in the entire NFL. And if the Patriots found him expendable. Georgia State, thanks. But Derwin James picked him up and body slammed him to the ground. And when his body hit the ground is when the ball popped up. So that's why they're going to calm down. He lifts him up. That's a big man. Throws him down. And now the Chiefs want to go tempo. They're at the line of scrimmage ready to go. Yeah, they don't want a challenge. They don't want it to be looked at. That's it. He should be Friday night WWE. He looked like he enjoyed doing that, Derwin James. First and goal. McKinnon. Can he get to the goal line? He cannot. Second down and goal. A little over a minute to play in the third. Good push up in the middle there. Creed Humphrey. Linebackers coming down here. I mean, it's the one chance picking up a big man and body slamming him. Clearly he's down. The ground caused that fumble. Bang. It's an idea of the strength. Number three. Tremendous. Second and goal. Mahomes to the end zone and broken up in the end zone by Asante Samuel. Had his eye set on Jody Forch in the tight end Samuel breaks it up Yeah, 6'4 tight end who has wide receiver background But if you're going to go with this matchup because of the size I'm surprised he didn't put it up into the air He threw that on a line And the quickness of Samuel gave him a chance to jump on that football If you get a guy isolated against a smaller corner You've got to put it a little more touch up in the air And let him go up in high point Third and goal, a little shovel pass and it's complete but not to the goal line. That's Kelsey. They got a shovel pass touchdown last week to Edwards-Alairs. And now, do you take the automatic tie or do you go for the touchdown here? Well, yeah. They have the whole intermission to think about it because that will be the end of the third quarter. Good brawn, at least for the moment. Amendola is in to try to tie the game. A big discussion there. Would they elect to go to tie it up? So the newly acquired rental kicker sends that one right down the middle, and we are tied up. The kick is pounding through the end zone. And then I'll fly to Kyle Field. There you go. After the game. What a weekend. Oh, we've got a late flag here. We've got a flag down. Meanwhile, coaches, 100 games over .500. Shula Hallis, they finished over .500. Belichick, way over now. Landry and Lambeau were over, but finished under .100 over .500, if you know what I mean. I'm sure you do. Oh, yeah. After the play was over. Punch here. Personal foul, number six of the kicking team. That 15-yard penalty will be enforced from the 25-yard line. First down. And the rookie out of Cincinnati loses his cool here. Brian Cook. Yeah, this is what you've got to learn. Hopefully come into the league already knowing it's 57. Boom, a little push there. It wasn't malicious, but it was well after the whistle and easy call. And Chargers will say, thank you very much. They'll start at the 40 after that. No can do second round pick, who was known as a hard hitter in college. But do it before the whistle sounds. So the Chargers now from the 40-yard line. You've got Storm Norton coming into the game at right tackle. They're shifting around to the offensive front. And they start with a play fake. Herbert has to dance away under pressure. Throws to Eckler. Escapes the tackle behind the line of scrimmage. Turns it into a short game. It's Carl Loftus, the rookie out of Purdue. He just throws Eckler away, and then he's trying to get pressure. It's one thing. You think of Mahomes and his athletic ability, but Justin Herbert at 6'6". He doesn't just sit in the pocket. He's dangerous and can get outside if you don't keep the edge of the defense. Sees this pressure right here from Snead. Steve backs off. A little flip out to Eckler. Dances his way, and he gets hog-tied. Close to a first down. So shifting around up front. Meanwhile, on a third and short, they move the change here on an Eckler three or four-yard pickup. Good push there on the left side. The offensive line, Mike Dana kind of took himself out of the play. and yet a double team inside and just opened that up there on third and short. Big drive here for the Chargers. Trying to locate that rhythm that Joe Lombardi had earlier. Remember, we just mentioned they went two straight three and outs with poor field position. Now much better here starting at their own 40. What did the grandson of Vince send in here? Play fake. Swings it to the outside. Joshua Palmer makes the catch and slips out of bounds after a short game. Now Herbert's trying to take a page out of Patrick Mahomes. Steve Spagnuolo sitting back in coverage, forcing him to go underneath. No more Mike Williams shots is what Spags is saying. I don't want to see that ball thrown downfield. Make him throw underneath. Let's rally to the ball. Herbert 20-29, 197. Flip it out to the motion man. Carter tightropes the sideline and stays inbounds long enough to pick up the first down. Nice move. He motions Carter. Nobody responds. Nobody runs with him. So if they would have run with him, it would have been man-to-man. He would have handed that ball off. nobody runs with him, so he aborts that run, flips it outside of Carter where he's got two on two for blocking, and it allows Carter to pick up the first down. Well-designed play there, and it gave the quarterback, Herbert, the option of the handoff of the throw. Read it perfectly. Herbert. Progressions. Caught at the 31-yard line. Gerald Everett. Tackle there by Fenton. Everett with the Rams. When Staley was there, went to Seattle for one year, and now he's back with Staley. Everett again just kind of working through those progressions, showing his patience. He wants to go to the right, comes off one, comes off two, steps up, and eventually finds that third option. And he works through his progressions as fast as anybody in the NFL and throws with accuracy. Second and three. On a roll. Open. Hits Everett. And Everett barrels his way inside the five to set up a first down and goal. Boy, how about this? You go play action. The linebackers are completely lost on this. Gives the ball out to Everett. Nobody's there to slow him down. picks up that momentum. Big guy to bring down. Again, quick tempo. And picked off at the one-yard line. That is Watson. Out in front. Sneed to protect him as well. All the way for the touchdown. Unreal. Wow, what a play here. Watch what happens where he's outside leverage. He sits to the outside, and that's what Herbert sees. It's at the top of the route. He thinks he's got inside. He's got a chance to throw to the inside, and instead of being able to put it there, it's jumped. Perfect timing. Great job by a rookie in Watson to step in front of that throw where Herbert thought he had the leverage to work it back to the inside. Not only a rookie, a seventh-round draft choice because of the injury to McDuffie in the backfield. One of the reasons he's probably active for tonight's game. Amendola. 99 yards, 24-17. Jalen Watson. What is your career highlight, Jalen? No doubt about it. He gets a touchdown. Offensively, their touchdown was scored by Justin Watson. No relation. Sherlock Holmes must be in the neighborhood. No doubt. Another Watson touchdown. So the Chargers get it back. The Chiefs have scored 17 unanswered points. A look again. Let's go back to Gerald Everett. The play before. He's top. You were on the call? Yes. I'm here for everything. Mike Williams, second visiting play, 100 or more yards, three straight games at Arrowhead. Touchdown here. What concentration again. Gets the right arm down, takes care of the right buttocks, as you said, gets in. Right. His mom, Francine, his girlfriend, Farrah, they get the ball. Yep. And now Mahomes has the ball for the first time in the second half. The blue. And it's good. Keeping in the pocket. Gets hit as he throws deep downfield. Contested and a flag is thrown. So it's picked off here by James. But you saw the flag and Hardman is down and writhing and rolling around and limping off the field. You don't find the football and it's an underthrown ball. There's going to be pass interference on the defense. So he takes it all away and you've got two flags. Adderley. You also have two flags back near the line of scrimmage. You have four flags on the field. Two fouls on the play, one by each team. Holding offense number 57. Pass interference. Defense number 24. By rule, those fouls will offset. Replay first down. You ever seen four flags on the field? No. Only two calls though. Here's the obvious pass interference and an underthrown ball where you see Hardman try to work back but Aurelie there doesn't locate the ball and then the big man Orlando Brown going against Bosa clearly. It's one way to slow down 97. Just grab onto that jersey to prevent him from getting to your quarterback. Austin Johnson put a look on Mahomes on that play. He's done that tonight. Mahomes backs up. Steps up. fires and that's nearly quick and maybe Samuel does he come up with it? Did it hit the ground? He thinks he's picked it. The question is, did it hit the ground or not? Mahomes is walking away as if I know it's an interception. And it is. What a play by Asante Samuel. Yeah, and I think there's some miscommunication. Kelsey is supposed to continue to come down flat. At least that's what Mahomes thought. Terry McCauley you're watching this with us bobble juggle does the ground help it control it Terry he does not get control before the ball hits the ground it's an incomplete pass Al so for the moment little fingers on it there and then he loses control and it hits the ground so Hushie's going to hold up play because the Chargers have come out on offense and the Chiefs have come out on defense it's under review here it is Yep. All turnovers. After review, the defender did not complete the catch. The ball hit the ground. Therefore, it is an incomplete pass. Will the game clock operator please set the game clock to 938, please. 938, and it will be second down. I think the most important thing I've taken away here to start this second half of the Chiefs Mahomes looks a bit unsettled in that pocket. Two now. Forced throws to start his second half. Well, every team, or most teams anyway, said we've got to keep Mahomes in the pocket. Chargers have done that to them. They sure have. Yeah. Yeah. The blue, the blue, the blue. The blue, and it's done. Second and ten. Quick pass. Caught. And that'll be a first down as he goes to Noah Gray. Number two tight end. And that's a first down. Going back to a bread and butter play. Quick slant. Take the back out into the flat. Linebacker clears out because he has to respect the threat to the out onto the edge. Makes it really easy for Mahomes to throw in rhythm there. Maybe that'll get him going. Right for you, not blind. Come on, Eddie. Let's hunt. Good protection again. Next time it's Smith-Schuster. They ride him right into the Charger bench. Does J.C. Jackson. So Smith-Schuster, some good years in Pittsburgh. Kind of an underneath guy when they got him. They sent Hill to Miami. They needed an underneath guy. They got him. And an over-the-top guy, and that's why they got Valdez-Scantling from Green Bay. Well, right now, Valdez-Scantling is not getting downfield because the Chargers are doing what a lot of teams did last year. They making Mahomes be patient and have to take what the defense is giving him which is again everything underneath nothing downfield at all Second rule but every team in the division but the winner of this game is going to have a loss Second down and nine from the 17. Pressure. And the pass is incomplete. The crowd wants a flag. None available. Adderley covering Valdez-Scantling. It'll be third down and nine. At the top of the route, I think that's what Mahomes and his crowd, and even Andy Reid, is looking at. Adderley off to the left on the inside. Once he breaks to the outside, 24 gets a hold of him. At the end, he puts his hands up, but I think he may have gotten away with one there. Small break for the Chargers. That stops the clock. Doesn't have to use another timeout. Third down and nine. Four-man rush again. A dart caught at the 14, stopped there. Now the field goal team will come in to try to make this a two-possession game, catch made by Juju Smith-Schuster. And Staley will use his second timeout, and there's been three real big plays in this game. We talked about how the Chargers had moved the ball all the way down to the three-yard line, and then this throw with a miscommunication in the pick six. And then we start to see Chris Jones make himself felt. Third down and six, last time they had the ball, just forcing it in to Mike Williams, hoping that he could come up with it, and the ball really didn't have much of a chance, throwing it into coverage. Matt Amendola trying to make this a ten-point game. He's been good tonight. With the Jets last year, not very good. Got released. Was out on the street last week. Saw him in preseason with the Texans. When Fairbairn was injured. And now trying to, as a rental kicker, give them a 10-point lead. 32-yard attempt. Bangs it through. Welcome to Kansas City. Yeah. New hero. So it's 27-17. and 20 straight points now for Kansas City. His pervert is still on the mend. And he's talking to the backup Chase Daniel just kind of pointing to where maybe he's feeling some of that pain. He's going to warm up. Give it a go again. 320. You've got... He doesn't look comfortable. No, not at all. No, he does not look comfortable. But the good news for Herbert is at least he's got an extra half a week to get ready for week three because of the Thursday night game. Meanwhile, he's got the run back here up to the 27-yard line by DeAndre Carter with 3.16 on the clock. Even look at him just jogging onto the field, right? He definitely is fighting through some pain here. He's got the one timeout, the two-minute warning. and they're obviously, they've already gone a lot of tempo tonight but they're really going to have to crank it up now with down 10 points. They've got to get points on the board and get the ball back. And now you've got a defense that's going to be coming after him. Eckler. A little bit of room. And a lot of good moves there to take it out close to midfield. Such a great part of this offense. It's not just the passing game with the receivers. It's the tight ends. It's Eckler out of the backfield. Makes something look like a three-yard gain into a huge play. Under three now to go. Again, it's Eckler underneath looking for the sideline to stop the clock. Picks up about six, second and four. Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator for the Chiefs, is saying, hey guys, let's stay back. Nothing cheap. They want to throw underneath to Eckler. We're going to give that up and rally to that football. Nothing can get behind us with Mike Williams, 81. Williams, huge first half. Only two catches in the second half. Herbert. Again to the outside. And that will be a little short of the first down. Sneed is right there tackling Joshua Kelly. It will be third down and two. Not only do you not pick up the first down, but you don't get the ball out of bounds. The clock keeps moving. He told me his phone was off the hook. He didn't really see it. He's enjoying the TV. I think all those guys and girls enjoy the TV. Absolutely. So now you've got an onside kicker. Of course, the Chiefs anticipating it. Only have one guy back. In case it's a bouncing ball down the middle of the field. And Hopkins, who was with Washington last year, charges with these, as I mentioned before, and several times through the years, gigantic kicking woes over the last decade. Can he execute the onside and keep them in the game? Success rate 17% in the league last year. A little bouncing ball. And it's loose. And a pileup for it. Who's got it on the bottom of it? Who's at the bottom? Kansas City. Looks like Noah Gray might have gotten underneath there. Yep. He wants to make sure. He says, listen, here it is. Here's the evidence. If you're a Chargers fan, you're thinking, it's loose. It's loose. Great job by Gray. That ball was out there. What an effort tonight by Herbert. Again, and another excruciating defeat. As it was last year in Las Vegas at the end of the season when they could have the tie and the run out here. and the Kansas City Chiefs go to Arizona and win. Beat their nemesis tonight. Andy Reid is now 100 games over 500. Sixth head coach in league history to get to that point, 235-135-1. And at least Justin Herbert will have the extra three days to get ready for the Chargers next game. It's obviously early, but I got a feeling that these two teams along with Buffalo are three of the more impressive looking teams we've seen in the first couple games in the NFL. Long way to Arizona, Spagnuolo telling Herbert Mann. Stud. You are a stud. They play the Jaguars at home a week from Sunday. Then they go to Houston. Then they go to Cleveland. Meanwhile, Kansas City goes to Indianapolis week three. and then at the Buccaneers in a Sunday night game week four. This was the play of the game. The rookie. Watson. 99 yards. There's Mahomes. Way to go, pal. He says to the kid. Herbert tries to bring him back again. Magic to keep the game going. the onside. Almost, almost, almost. But nope. No cigar. 27-24. Stick with us. Prime video. The gang will take it from Kansas City after these messages. Halfway through the fourth quarter. Second down and seven. A little dump off. Edward Jallaire. Room to roam. First down. And about six more yards. tackled by Derwin James first down one way to slow down Bosa is to throw a screen on his side let him get up field and see if he can get a convoy behind it, nobody really necessarily picks up the block, but there's Bosa Wiley, little spin move okay, bait him in and then flip it out there to Edwards Hilaire, a lot of room for him to work behind Bosa On the ground to McKinnon again. Not seeing the Chiefs out there a lot tonight offensively. You know, you think of the firepower, you think of Mahomes. Andy Reid has, again, had to be patient. They have to pick six, but only 45 plays with six minutes, six and a half minutes to go in the game. The impatient right now too. Yeah, I mean there's a long way to go obviously But you know for one that don't run down no rush keep the clock moving Which he does with great proficiency as always Thanks to play clock all the way to two second down in six And that's away, and that time it's Kyle Van Noyze close to a pick. Third down and six. You know, you could hear the cadence from Mahomes talking about alert, alert, and making some adjustments. He's thinking potential pressure, and he's starting to think about, I've got to get the ball out. James is coming from my left, and they don't. So they disguise it. He's thinking about a crosser might be open, and it almost backfires on him. They show pressure, they bail, and he puts it right into the coverage exactly what Brandon Staley wanted. Van Noy almost comes up with a pick. Close to getting a little bit of the jersey. Third down and six. Chargers put the pressure on. Pass is incomplete. And overthrown on that one. You got Valdez-Scantling covered by Asante Samuel. So exactly what the Chargers need him. Get him off the field. Asante Samuel is having a night. They are not getting behind him. He's playing with poise. Instincts are on fire tonight. Getting his eyes turned, locating the football. Heck of a night for 2-6. Almost had that pick. Yeah, that would have been gigantic. Tommy Townsend, sixth punt of the night. Carter calls for the fair catch. And the Chargers get the ball at the 15-yard line. We've been talking a lot. Big expectations for Chris Jones this year, just playing inside. Had a quiet first half, but starting to move around. Was on the offensive line's right side against the rookie. Johnson is working now to the left. Spagnuolo doing a good job of moving him around. He's so effective, not only against the run, but as we see also against the pass. You've got to believe, late in the game, just under six minutes to go, keep an eye on the interior of the Chiefs, especially when Herbert's back there throwing. and he's a disruptor. Picking the second round back in 2016 out of Mississippi State. Herbert surveys, checks it off, and Eckler drops it, took his eyes off it, looked downfield. Second down and 10. A little change up here from Steve Spagnuolo. He always does such a good job of being multiple. That time showed a little bit of pressure, but instead he just rushes three. Drops eight into coverage. Even if he catches that ball, there's two defenders waiting on Eckler. Williams wide left with Fenton on him. Pass over the middle into a tight window, as the saying goes. And that's Everett making the grab, and that sets up a third down and short. So what does Staley and Lombardi do here? Third down and two. What's the call? Oh, please. Third and two. Herbert, look out. Fires, and that's caught. And once again, it's Everett. So under pressure, darting and dancing and stepping up in the pocket, and down he goes, and Herbert needs some help in getting up. Look out. Holding his ribcage and uh-oh. Mike Dana hit him as he released the ball. Put his shoulder pads right into his chest. Third and two. We've got two plays here, obviously, to pick up the first. Third and a long one, they call it now. Pump fake. You can tell he's in such pain right there. He can barely get rid of it. Wow. Oh, yeah. That was very, very strange to see Herbert, who could have walked another couple yards and picked up a first down. Gives you an idea, right? Yeah, he can't even throw it. I mean, he's in pain. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well. Yeah, he could have run and slid and picked up the first down, right? Of course. Trying to gut it out. Can he keep it alive? Fires it. Caught! Inside the 10-yard line by DeAndre Carter. So there is Herbert again with that fourth down magic. We saw it all of last year. And that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. With 158. This is what makes Herbert one of the elite quarterbacks. He just decided not to run on third down. And he comes back with an absolute dart on fourth down. Could not have handed the ball any better to Carter on that throw. That was tight coverage. That's amazing. He used to play before that. He can't run. He can't throw either. I mean, it was an awkward pass. And then he goes back and he throws a dart down the middle to keep them in the game. It's like a boxer, right, on the ropes late in a fight. And you're thinking he's done. And then he comes back. And some of the hits he's taken in this second half alone, you can see his face. I mean, he's uncomfortable. I think it's not one hit. It's been a combination of three or four different hits. but to be able to withstand that and stand in there with pressure and make that throw tells you everything you need to know about this kid's heart. It's like out of a movie. At least a made-for-TV one anyway, you know. First and goal. 158. Chargers have one timeout. Herbert to the outside. Eckler tries to stay in, but he does. In a way, you want to You know, you want to get out of bounds, but then again, he was trying to pick up extra yardage. He's tackled there by Willie Gay. Clock keeps moving. Charges three for three on fourth down tonight. Right now, second down and goal. Herbert fires too high. Incomplete. Intended for Palmer. Third and goal. I don't understand why the clock didn't stop. I mean, he got thrown out of bounds. But the official came in Inside Yeah, look at this Here's Gay You know You tell me Terry, quickly, what do you think? Al, he ruled for progress It's not It should have been a stop Third and goal Herbert Does he have more magic? Eckler Not on that play Eckler taken down by Gay. And here we go again. Clock will roll. Fourth and goal. Here we go. More magic on fourth down. Yes! Joshua Palmer. Herbert is unbelievable. Unbelievable. So poised. just will not go away. Remember, he tried to force one in earlier. Tried to get the ball into Mike Williams. This time, doesn't even think about it. Just kind of works back to the backside to Palmer. Looks left, comes back, and then finds that nice opening in the back of that defense. Palmer, look at his eyes creeping back. I think he knew all along he could get it to him. Never seen a crowd go from 147 decibels to 3. That did it. Extra point here by Dustin Hopkins. So now it's 27 to 24. You're compelled to try an onside kick here. Well, you have to. Only the one timeout. Come down to that. Very big man. Keep telling him he may get a call. He's fired. He's gassed. They're going tempo. They can't get him out. You can see he wants out of the game. He's like, oh, he's going to stay in. And he ends up becoming a pivotal part of this because he's lined up. He's working to the flat. There's 35 right there kind of baiting Herbert Watson. I'm outside, I'm outside. Jumps to the inside. You might say, whose fault is that? Is it Everett? Is it Herbert? It's a miscommunication. The quarterback thought that he would work back inside with outside leverage from the defensive back, and he ended up moving the wrong direction. That's why they're talking on the sideline to get on the same page. 99 yards, as Tom Maratham said, 99 and a half. Herbert backs up. Short gain here, caught by Austin Eckler, tackled there by Willie Gay with a little over 10 to play in regulation. You look at all the quarterbacks in the NFL, and everybody talks about Josh Allen, and they should. You talk about Mahomes, you talk about Joe Burrow, you talk about Lamar Jackson, and you talk about Justin Herbert. They played great tonight. That pick six, costly. Ten minutes to go. You want to be in that conversation as a quarterback? This is where you've got to show that on the road. Keep it on the ground again. Fighting his way to create a third and short. Eckler tackled by Darius Harris. Remember, they just had a heck of a drive starting at their own 40. Mixed up the pass. Brandon Staley's got to be happy with the way Herbert and Lombardi are working in sync. Got to convert on this third down. They are 4 of 11 on third down tonight. 4 of 12 now. Chris Jones. the foodie who snacks at McDonald's where they walk up Willie Gay to create that one-on-one matchup you see Gay just to the left of Jones we've said he's had a quiet night where he gets off the ball so suddenly he just overpowers Filer the left guard nothing he can do by the time he came out of his stance 95 reminding everybody how dominant he is in this defense having a quiet night until the fourth quarter That's right. All that healthy eating lets him take over the fourth quarter. Good question. Stamina, baby. And now you've got a flag before the snap. A little snap infraction. Offense number 47. Five-yard penalty. Fourth down. It's Josh Harris, the legal snap infraction. Yeah, I think he just moved right before the snap, and he's one of the top long snappers in the league. They were able to pick him up, but cost him five more yards. Scott angled toward the near side. Flag is thrown. Caught at the 30. And Sky Moore to the 35. Get the call here from John Hussey. There it is right there. Has to get back in. That's Jasir Taylor. During the kicks, personal foul, receiving team number six, blocking the number of the kicking team out of bounds. That 15-yard penalty will be enforced from the end of the kick. First down, timeout. Well, that's on Brian Cook, who's having a night to forget as the second-round draft choice. It's two 15-yard penalties. 24-17, Kansas City. Meanwhile, Casey has it at the 15-yard line. To start this drive. Trying to hold on to the lead. Take a little clock with it as well if they can. Edwards will air for a gain of about four. Patrick Mahomes has had to really earn it tonight. Like we saw last year. He's done it in a lot of different areas. He's been moving the launch angle because of that pressure. There's the infamous Mahomes sidearm on the run. Doing such a good job here, especially late. Being able to find some playmakers. Justin Watson made a big play for him. Kelsey made a big play for him. And then came down on him. Does a good job, as he always does, working the progressions. But here you see that wrapped up right as he releases it. And he comes down. So every Charger fan holds their breath. The backup quarterback is the well-traveled and 13-year veteran Chase Daniel. A clean hit by Dana. So they work on Herbert as Daniel warms up. Here's the good news. That's him walking off. He goes to the bench. Right now he is standing on the sideline, helmet on, and appears to be ready to come in after one play. But he has to sit out for at least one play. Chase Daniel is the backup quarterback, one-time chief, played his college ball at Missouri, in the league 13 seasons. This is his 17. So at least for one play, Daniel comes in. Sonny Michel is the back. And they give it to Michel on a first down, and he gets hogtied at the 39-yard line. And now Herbert is going to come back into the game. Go to a veteran quarterback, gets under center, simple handoff, and now you get your guy back into the lineup. And they pick up some positive yards, you know? I mean, second and sixth. You talk about a heart in your throat moment For anybody in the Charger organization Of course I did a game once when he carted Aaron Rodgers off the field And he came back and he won the game He had to be down by 20 Never know High drama Second down and six Herbert to the out Oh and that one is deflected off the hands And again Herbert goes down Takes another shot this time from Frank Clark Helped up by Slater. It's going to be third down and six. Again, another clean hit. Clark coming from our right. Hits him as he releases that ball. Actually makes that throw. How often do you see Herbert throw high? It's because of the pressure he felt. And the Chiefs almost come away with an interception. Well, Herbert's going to stay in. Obviously in pain. Stood off to the side of the huddle for a minute. And you've got a big third and six with four minutes to play. Can he convert? No. And as lucky, it wasn't picked by Bolton. So he goes to the bench, fourth down and six, and they have to punt. Yeah, and I circle Mike Williams because you've got to think he's going to get the ball. And I think the Chiefs and everybody watching, everybody in this stadium thought that he's going to get the ball. Look at this. He predetermines where to go with the ball. I mean, that is tight. I know he can throw it into tight windows. That is tight coverage. I think he's had such success with Williams tonight, and I don't think he reads this one. Sky-high punt. Caught at the 9-yard line by Sky Moore to the 15. So the Chargers have all of their timeouts. You also have the 2-minute warning, and you have 3.55 on the clock. Next week, we go to Cleveland. Nasty. You're good. Two-hour drive between the cities. Chiefs now on first down. Protecting the ball and getting out in front. Edwards O'Leary brings a flag down. A flag is down. And so is O'Leary. I don't think... Both arms around the ball. What a penalty flag. Back at the 21-yard line. Looks like they may have grabbed his face mask. But you're right. He was not going to let go of that football late in the game up seven. Personal foul. Face mask. Defense number 13. That penalty will be going to the end of the run. First down. That's a unique face mask with a shield. It's hard to get a hold of that one. Really good job late in the game. Trey Smith there, 65. He gets to that second level. I'm telling you, he is a physical runner. There's a hand there by Derwin James. The left hand gets locked up. doesn't slow him down but boy just like that they're all the way inside the 20 yard line well you had a 52 yard run yeah seven point game 345 well down at the 18 yard line now McKinnon in the backfield give it to him time to chew up some clock here at the Chiefs Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes absolutely no hurry very least you want to force the Chargers to use all their timeouts here there's the first
