 They can pressure the quarterback, especially off the edges. That time Barrett's able to get to him. But he looked left. That's the first time we've seen him dial up Diggs. And just as they expected, Tampa, especially the closer you get to the red zone, Todd Bowles putting a safety over top to give him that double coverage. Rolled up corner and a safety over top, making it tough to get the ball down to Diggs. Now Cook is in the game. second year man out of Georgia further Dalvin all those good years at Minnesota now with the Jets Allen hangs in there fires caught 20 yard line hold in there by Shakir so three catches already Devin White makes the tackle sets up a third and six for these two linebackers Devin White, Levante David as a tandem when they're healthy they cover a lot of ground in the middle of that defense. Both right now, eyes looking around, head on a swivel, trying to make sure those balls are not complete, and if they are, there's no yards after the catch. A bunch off to the left side. Allen looking that way, throwing that way. Great tackle at the 19-yard line. That is, Christian isn't tackling bigs after he makes his first catch. Of the night, 4-10-5. Is he in here really familiar with situational awareness there on third down and short? He's locked up in man-to-man coverage. And, again, you're going to give up some completions when you're off. But when you're manned up, a guy like Diggs makes a catch. You're right there to be able to bring him down. Again, no yards after the catch, back-to-back plays. Tyler Bass, one of the best in the league. 37-yard attempt to try to give them the lead, which he does. Barely gets it inside. The crowd already singing, chanting, screaming to this point. Tompkins takes it. And, whoa, takes a shot as he gets to the 20-yard line. Josh Norman signed to the practice squad this month and activated. Meanwhile, Baker Mayfield, head coach for the first six seasons. Number one pick overall back in 18. Take a look at this. Only quarterback to start. Again for eight different head coaches in the first six seasons. Ryan Fitzpatrick, our colleague here tonight. Steve DeBerg had 11 head coaches in longer careers. But Mayfield is on a pace to exceed those guys. Not to mention, like you say, all the different systems. We learned how quickly he could pick up a system last year in Los Angeles. He's had seven different offensive coordinators. Meanwhile, breaking a tackle, Chris Godwin. And that's the first down in the game of about 14. A little skirmish develops on the sideline. What's been impressive to me is Baker comes in for Tom Brady, and Tom Brady meant so much to that organization, winning a Super Bowl and just being Tom Brady. And Baker has to come in and fill those shoes. And to me, the way they were able to start winning a couple games, teams started to look like they were playing a little chippy, and a little bit of his personality rubbing off on the team. And, of course, they've hit a wall here in the last few weeks, but they're trying to get back on track. And I think the team has really responded to his leadership. And a one for a wife. Let's put that to Kaylee. Guys, Tristan Wirfs told me he hates to use the word swagger to describe Baker Mayfield's best quality because everybody uses it. But he said it's accurate. By all accounts, Mayfield's mentality and his energy He made an impact on this Bucs team right out of the gate. No TAs as he tried to fill those big shoes. Forks said Baker's a dog. To see him go out and play with the intensity every week makes us all want to do the same thing. You know, he's got swagger. He's also very collegial. You should have seen him before the game came out to warm up and everything. He took about 20 selfies with the Buffalo fans. Second and eight. Flips this one out. Caught by White. And he's taken down. He'll be third and fourth. You mentioned that game last year. On a Tuesday, he winds up flying to Los Angeles. Ram signed him because Stafford was hurt. They didn't know about Walford coming into that game. He comes in. He does a cram course, 48 hours, with Sean McVay. By the way, congratulations to Sean and Veronica on the birthday baby boy on Monday. You're right. And of all offenses, it's Sean McVay's offense. He had the wristband out, doing the best that he could. And of all things, he needs a two-minute offense to win the game. He pulls it off. 98 yards to win it. Third down and five. Hangs in. Fires into traffic and knocked away at the last moment of flag. Open. Caught. Close to a first down. Shakir. We're using him on that first drive with three catches. And since then, he's got a couple more. That's five on the night. You're also seeing different ways of attacking. That time in an empty set, spreads his defense out of Tampa Bay, lets Josh Allen find that one-on-one matchup that he likes. Second and two just across midfield. And that's a first down on a game of four for James Cook to the 44-yard line. He touched on Shakir. That's a career high for him tonight. So, you know, with Diggs up to this point not having a big night, and, of course, with Dalton Kincaid having some opportunities to always touch down, Gabe Davis has made some plays. Kind of looking for that third receiver, and tonight it's been number 10. Allen over 200 yards passing. Takes a throw, and then you've got a flag down here as Allen comes close to what would be a first down pending the call. He got to that edge pretty quickly. I don't know if Gabe Davis helped him, 13, get to that edge. Ryan Neal held on to Kincaid on his round. Kincaid kind of showing it and then releases and on that release, good job of disguising it. He just grabs onto his waist. But it's fun to see when Josh Allen gets that momentum and he's rolling right again. he's a lot to handle with 240 pounds running downhill quickly Davis and a first down been a big night for him gave Davis has been targeted seven times he's caught six for 61 yards he's a big target he's been in his system now for a number of years and Josh Allen knows where he likes the football and those quick throws gives him a chance to get up field blockers in front of him and this is where you gotta earn your keep against the Tampa defense down in this area all no huddle, all up tempo first down Allen fires pulled in 16 yard line that's Diggs in about three, so it's second down and seven. And for Diggs, that is catch number four, but for only 32 yards. You don't see that very often. Normally he leads by plenty. Dave Davis again great move to the inside down the sideline he goes to set up a first down and goes he gets away from Jamel Dean it's that RPO that Josh Allen runs as well as anybody he gets it out of his hands so quickly and notices that he's got a chance and because he gets the ball out of his hands so quickly that's why you see the yards after the catch and Gabe Davis able to make him miss. Boy, he aborted that so quickly, recognizing what he wanted and getting the ball out there to 13. Eight play in the drive coming. Latavius Murray is the back. Give it to him. To the outside, he swings and taken down from behind on a nice tackle there. Nelson in on the stoppably second down and goal. Nelson brings a different dynamic to the edge of that defense. 6'7". He uses those long arms. Doesn't have the quickness that some of the other edge players have. But with that length, he's able to win. It's a great matchup right there with Edwards. See him kind of use that length and kind of extend. Keep his eyes in the backfield and make sure he's able to hold up outside. Second and goal. Murray stays in. Deep drop. Surveys. Fires open. Davis. Touchdown. Boy, you get Davis going with digs. Now you're really cooking. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And you got to cross her here and here. and watch them try to communicate that he's coming over. Watch him use his hands. Hey, I need help. I need help. I need help. Nobody goes with him. And for Rockham Jarrett. Defense paying a lot of attention to Mike Evans and Godwin and forcing the ball to be spread around. That ball is low in a way. It would have been a heck of an effort and catch by Jarrett. Comes close, but once he went to the surface, that ball is out. Von Miller seeing spot duty. There he is. Played only a handful of snaps last week. Just a few so far tonight. Mayfield fires. That's caught. Taking it inside the 40. Goes to Godwin there. Chris Godwin. And that will make it third down and nine. They rotate a lot of defensive ends in there. I know we had an enjoyable zoom call with Von Miller. this week. He's been around this game for so long and he's accomplished so much, but he still sounds like a guy in his first or second year. He has such energy and passion for this game. Talked about maybe being a coach, maybe a GM. Just loves the game. 13th year in the NFL. Here they come. Mayfield hangs in throws. Incomplete. Double coverage there. Evans had no chance. Really, Jordan Poirier is there. Fourth down and nine. They got great pressure on the right side, able to hit him right as he threw the football. Jordan Phillips, as you said there, Al, got there and impacted that throw from Baker on third down. So you know who went into the tent? It was Josh Allen. That's interesting. Got the touchdown back in the tent. Meanwhile, you've got a field goal attempt here of 57 yards. Good. And a skirmish after the kick by McLaughlin, who earlier had one tipped. And no good. Now you've got another flag here coming in. You've got Geddikey involved in that. It started with Tim Settle and Nick Leverett. Right after the ball was kicked, they got tangled up. And Levert ends up landing on top of Settle. You'll see it right in the, if you can't stay with it right there. And Settle didn't care for that, of course. And then here comes everybody. Meanwhile, McLaughlin, it's so interesting. Oh, yeah, there you go. A little half MMA action here. The officials will gather and discuss. Meanwhile, lost in all of this stuff is a 57-yard field goal. Meanwhile, you've got... The field goal is good. There is no foul on the play. Timeout. So he told you that Josh Allen was in the tent, and Kyle Allen is warming up. We'll get to the bottom of this mystery when we come back. He was in for, he scored. But on the play before that, take a look at this. When he gets tackled by Diaby, rolls around, grimaces. It's tripped up, maybe lands on his shoulder. He kind of moves his right arm after the contact. He just kind of, it's about the only thing we've seen that looked like, hmm. And you mentioned the next play. There it is a little bit more, kind of stretching things out. Then he scores, goes into the tent. Kyle Allen is warming up, or was warming up. But now it looks like. It's all a smile. Yeah, Josh comes back in. and he'll make it official right now as he takes over the 25 yard line it's great to see him back out there i think all nfl fans anytime you see a player his magnitude any player but especially what he means to this team and it's a big part of the reason that they've been hesitant to run it now tonight it's old josh allen we've seen him run the football we've seen him do what he normally is capable of doing with not just his arm but his legs then you have a little setback like that and you hold your breath. And that's kind of the balancing act that Ken Dorsey and his offensive coaching staff, what they deal with. Start with Cook in the backfield, play action. Tipped in the air, and Tampa Bay thinks they have come up with it. Meanwhile, coming in was Antoine Winfield forcing it, and the Tampa Bay Bucs with William Golston coming up with it on the turnover. What a playing Winfield is something else. He is. He is. I'll tell you what, he does a really good job of it here in his fourth year. You know, he played a lot in that slot last year. He's back to free safety. He disguises that so well. Completely surprised Josh Allen. Had no idea that he was going to be that quickly into the backfield. And once it's into the air, it's a free ball. Great job of being aware by Golston and going up and getting it. Here he comes right here, expecting that boot, gets into his face, Balls in the air, and the Bucs have great field position. Dolson, his 11th season in the league, his first interception at the 23-yard line. Mayfield now, off play action, sets up a screen. White, inside the 20, first down and more, and a first and goal. This is what you want to see, Howie, is get White in space. And if you can't do it in the run game, you get him going in the screen game, you get him involved in the pass game. Baker Mayfield telling me on the field before the game, I said, man, White's got some juice. He said, yeah, we've got to find ways to get him out in space tonight. And here's an example of doing that. Good job. Look at Hainsey hustling downfield 70. The Bucs are in business now inside the five-yard line. But you can see what he is capable of doing as a receiver out of that backfield. And Stinney, too. First and goal. Play fake. Pass is caught for the touchdown. Chris Godwin. And this game has been flipped on its head. Meanwhile, Allen, they were looking at him. He's checking out the replay of his last sequence, what happened on that. You get the interception. You got a nice run by White. Then you got the pass to Godwin. And we're a point away from being tied. Look at his play actions. Linebackers come down. What a rout by Godwin. He had inside leverage by Johnson. He works into the outside and then a quick instep, and he's able to get across to his body. And Baker Mayfield held on, held on, and then just put it right on the money for the touchdown. Going back to last year, Godwin had made 60 catches without a touchdown. Desmond Ritter going to the end zone. Here's Winfield. Instead of a touchdown, he knocks it out before he gets to the goal line. And it turns out to be a touchback because it bounds out of the end zone. You don't see plays any better. And here he is again tonight. Yeah, here he is again disguising the pressure and doing a good job of staying home off this naked. Right there, knocks it into the air. Just a guy that has incredible savvy instincts. As a rookie, he was able to come in and be a part of a championship team. And his father was an incredible player. Obviously taught him a lot as a youngster. and just fun to watch guys that love the game as much as Antoine Winfield Jr. The senior played 14 seasons. That play he made last week kept him in the game. I mean, the game's over if that's a touchdown. They couldn't capitalize at the end, but it was a phenomenal play. Meanwhile, he got the touch back here, and Allen and his group take over the 25 with 6.46 to play in the opening half. What a turn of events. Tampa's down 10 in this environment. The Bucs showing a little bit of attitude of their quarterback Baker Mayfield. Fighting for everything that they've gotten up to this point to tie this game up at 10. Allen 11 of 14. 129. 129 yards, one pick. Took the running back. Biggs now sets up behind him. Inside handle. Cut to the outside. Nice move. Cook. For a gain of 19. Tackled there by Ryan Neal. We just bragged on Winfield, but he and Shaq Barrett this time. Watch these two right here. Watch how the edge of this defense just kind of loses the edge. It makes it pretty easy for a running back with vision like Cook is able to bounce that out wide and get upfield. Hangs in. Wide open. Davis tripped up. 44-yard line tackle is made by Carlton Davis. We're going to see Davis getting his hands on the football a little bit more. He's been quiet over the last two weeks. And I think tonight with... The crowd, of course, in full throat already in raucous Buffalo on this Thursday night with the temperature in the mid-60s. Tyler Bass to kick off. Buffalo won the toss and deferred. Devin Tompkins back to receive for Tampa Bay. We'll run it back from the one-yard line. all the way across the field and out to the 25-yard line. He goes, and that's where the Buccaneers will set up shop. Here is Baker Mayfield. Gidley said not only four teams, six seasons, eight different head coaches. This guy has seen a few playbooks. Eight TDs, four interceptions this season. Started out with those two wins. Cooled off. Let's see what's in store tonight. Crowd already frenzied. White is the running back. Comes up in the pistol. And hands it to White. Decent little hole there to begin things with. The 33-yard line. Bernard making the tackle. number 43. Keep an eye on him tonight. He's had a great season thus far second year out of Baylor. Great matchup tonight is Buffalo's interior against this run game. Tampa has struggled to run the football and Buffalo has had some issues with some injuries inside to defend the run. Go five wide here. Blitz coming. Mayfield has it. Batted in the air and not incomplete. We talked But Bernard, there he was again. So he's in on the first tackle. Batch this one away, and it's served down at four. You could argue he's as productive a middle linebacker as we've seen in the NFL in these first seven weeks. They move him around. Here he is, blitzing. He's had a lot of success doing that already. A couple sacks on the year. And Baker Mayfield that time recognizing that blitz a little bit late. And good tight coverage. Nowhere for him to go with that football. hangs in there, throws caught up at the 47-yard line. Trey Palmer, a rookie, spent three years at LSU, last year at Nebraska picked in the sixth round and converts the yard 14 yards. Good job here at picking up the blitz. Buffalo showed it, ended up bringing Bernard again. He's picked up by Rashad White, giving Baker Mayfield just enough time. He trusts that offensive line. See, one right there stepped up to pick up that blitz. Good tight throw there on third down by Baker Mayfield for the first. No way anybody on this offense can possibly hear any signal tonight. Mayfield fires wide open, but Evans can't get there, and the pass is incomplete. So Evans has had nine spectacular years, 1,000 yards plus, and each of them got free, couldn't get it. Incomplete, second down. Yeah, Buffalo's goal tonight with Tampa struggling to run the football is they want to play back. McDermott wants to play some zone. He wants to keep his safeties back. A couple veterans in Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer. And if they can defend the run with the safeties back, it'll be a great night for Buffalo's defense. Contrary to that, the Tampa Bay offense got to be able to run the ball to get those safeties down like this right here. something they haven't been able to do all season and action up front. Won't be the last time we see that with this noise. Left tackle Tristan Wurst. So tonight Matt Filer, who's their starting left guard, is out. It's the first time this season that anybody other than the starting five coming into tonight has taken a snap. Yeah, it's very unusual. Like you said, the only team in the NFL. And that was the only snap we've seen Baker Mayfield under center. And he gets a jump from the left tackle. He goes back to the gun here. New left guard is Aaron Stinney taking Fowler's spot. Second down, 15. Pressure again. Going to a knee after making the catch. So no chance to take off after the catch is Trey Palmer. Third down, no game. Third and 15. Dame Jackson in on that stop The last third down that Buffalo had They brought the pressure, it was picked up nicely Dave Canales, first year as the offensive coordinator Von Milner comes into the game He's been very sparingly used number 40 Coming back from Anytime you see a receiver get open like that It's just a miscommunication trying to pass over man coverage, going across the other way. Safety needs to be able to help him out there. Four minutes, 20 seconds, and, man, they made it look easy. 75 yards, nine plays, 24-10. It's about Black Friday, and now you look at that matchup with the way the Jets are playing defense. Zach Wilson's complimenting that running game a bit. They could be a factor. Barry Lees may be fighting for a wild card spot late in the year. Stream live on Prime, November 24th, day of the turkey day. So Tampa Bay, now down by 14, starts from the 25. Now that they're down those 14 points you talked about, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they continue to find different ways to get Mike Evans the ball. Just the one reception on the night. Talked about Sean McDermott coming into this game saying, listen, we're going to take 13 out, make someone else beat us, whether it's Godwin, whether it's the back, anybody but 13 because of his big playability. Make them drive the length of the field and see if our defense can create havoc, and they've done that, at least in the first half. Yeah, one catch, seven yards tonight. Mayfield under pressure, looked out, avoids a sack, takes off, turns a big loss into a nice game. Got away that time from Leonard Floyd. How did he get away? Especially from a guy who picks up a lot of sacks and knows how to put you down. And he's wearing a brace for the first time all year on that knee. You're thinking he's just going to go down here. I mean, Leonard Floyd's got him, right? And then he looks up, he sees there's an opening, takes off and uses that speed for a first down. What a way to start this drive. 11 yards up to the 36. Bucs erased a 10-point deficit. Now they'll have to do it from 14 in the rears. White. A couple. They showed a lot of moxie earlier in this game when they were down 10. This place was exploding. And they were able to chip their way back. They got a field goal. Eventually they got a turnover with the interception after the tip ball by Antoine. Winfield Jr. and Golston picks it off. Gave them great field position. They tied it up at 10. It's going to take that kind of toughness again to get themselves back into this football game. And maybe a break on the other side of the ball. Yeah. Play clock at 2. White. Spinarama. 41 he goes. Floyd makes the tackle third and five they're not panicking Dave Canales even though they have not been able to run the ball well all year they're continuing to show it tonight against a Buffalo defense at least in the interiors giving up some plays this year and they're not to that point where they're just going to say you know what we're going to throw it every down trying to make Buffalo respect that aspect but here on third down going to have to get some separation and give him time to throw 7-up in the pocket. Can only get to about the 43. Bernard making the stop right there. And Tampa Bay to putt. They might have gotten away with a defensive hold here on Mike Evans off to the left. But there's just nowhere to go. They show blitz with Bernard. He shows it. Now he's just a spy. Now he's looking for any kind of crossing routes. And then once the quarterback takes off, he's able to make that play to the left there at the top. Like the break of that route. Could have been a call there on Mike Evans. Another short kick, but a good bounce for Camarda to the 10-yard. BWS, it's Josh Allen. You know, he is known for his ability to scramble, and we brought it up all week on a lot of the calls, how much he scrambles to his right. Always looking to get the ball out to the right. Most right-handed quarterbacks like to do that, but Josh Allen especially. You can see he leads the NFL in attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns, and expected points added. So, been effective doing that tonight. And I'm sure that is something that Tampa's going to try to take away from him here. Meanwhile, there was a penalty. And in the company, Josh Hayes for that. And they come up with zero. Well, what an incredible adjustment by Tampa Bay. Anytime you see a defender run with a guy in motion, you expect man-to-man. Watch. Devin White runs with Dalton Kincaid. And when he runs with him, you think he's going to stay with him. Once he sees him, okay, you think he's a man-to-man. See the hand signal? There's Devin White. He passes it off to the corner, Jamel Dean. Great hand signals, and Dean is there perfectly. If it's man-to-man, that's a touchdown. Great job of adjusting there to the motion. Now Tampa Bay needs some breathing room. And taking it out to the three-yard line, Chase Edmonds, the former Arizona Cardinal, played with Miami and Denver last year and has been inactive for the last four games on injury reserve. In fact, with a knee injury. So he comes in and gives them some breathing room. They just trying to move it away from their own goal line right now Boy it incredible Right on cue Tampa Bay defense Tops in the league in red zone defense And it the reason they still hanging in this game even though they've given up some yards in these first couple drives. Yeah, 146, in fact, in a quarter and a few seconds. But only three points. Mayfield. Running out of time, and that's incomplete. so the line did its job, but the secondary did as well on the other side, third and eight. It looked like Baker came off his primary, got really uncomfortable. I think he expected some pressure, but good coverage downfield. The Bills matching up. Just nowhere for him to be able to go with that football, and even the check down taken away. See if the Bills bring a setback on that last play. Let's see if they try to come after him here. with his feet standing in his own end zone. Well, they only sent four. Mayfield fires, tipped, and incomplete. Batted twice that time. There is Bernard once again making his presence vote. Second-year man under Baylor, picked in the third round last year, and an emerging star. Yeah, here he is right here. That's what makes him so good. Al is, you know, he's just as comfortable in filling, you know, a team that's going to run the football and trying to fill a gap as he is out in coverage in space. That time just kind of sensing that there'd be a crosser, got his head on a swivel, able to get right in that throwing lane and make a play. So Jake Camarda leading the league in gross punting average, 52-9. His first boot was 53 yards. This is a line drive, caught at the 45, and still on the move and now moving backwards and trying to get around the corner this way. Hardy to the 23-yard line. So that's how a line drive kick set up perfectly for a run back. They had him when he went to his right, escapes, comes back to his left and sets him up once again deep in Tampa Bay territory. He has such quickness and suddenness to be able to get away from this. I mean, look at all these different defenders that have him corralled, but he just doesn't give up on the play. He did that all on his own, picked up a couple blocks. But right here, you're thinking, this is the NFL. There's no way he's going to be able to cut back. And he does. 5'6", 170 pounds, and gives the Bills really good field position here. 44-yard boot, 24-yard return. Ball to 23. There you go, 54. And move, move. running back is Cook digs moving cook inside handoff nice hole eight yard game 15-yard line that's on Deion Dawkins helping to lead the way as he pulls now the good news is they got great field position the tough news is they're now down in the red zone area where Tampa's defense seems to thrive So the Bills once again can't get a touchdown. Number 76 of the offense is reporting as eligible, number 76. Can't get a touchdown in the first quarter. Second down and two. Loaded up on the left side. Through the middle of this time goes James Cook. keep in mind with Dawson Knox out and Quentin Morris out you're talking about two tight ends out of this lineup so it changes the philosophy and how Ken Dorsey and this staff want to attack Dalton Kincaid is in and he's number 86 he is technically obviously a tight end as a rookie but really more of a receiver so they've got a little bit of a matter of if it was win and Tonight, they look like Buffalo, playing complimentary football. Josh Allen playing the way he can. See what their defense does after great special teams playing, pinning Baker Mayfield deep. Next game is in 10 days at Cincinnati. Meanwhile, slipping at the 6-yard line. Tackle there. Johnson, that's Edmonds again. Third down and long. You know, you talk about the fans wanting certain things. One of the great lines ever, Marv Levy, one of the great men. Hall of Fame coach, coached his team before Super Bowls. He once said, you start listening to the fans, pretty soon you're sitting with them. There you go. There he is, honored here on the ring, third and seven. Mayfield fires, and it's holding, but short of the first down. and then five blue shirts around Chris Godwin. So it's fourth down. That's the beauty of being able to rush four and sit back and play zone behind it. Bring a safety down and able to keep an eye exactly where you need to be as a defender. He's just kind of robbing, just kind of sitting there, reading the eyes of Baker Mayfield, sees that crosser and able to make that play. So you get the pressure with the four, able to bring a safety down right at that first down marker, keep them short of the first down and do another good job of getting the three and out after pinning Tampa deep in their own territory. Jake Kamara, been busy tonight. Just punt. This one is a boomer. 27-yard line. Running it back. Another good run back here for Hardy. Takes it to the 50 and a flag. That was an early plan. Very. That was a 61-yard boot for what it's worth until we find out the end result. Scott Novak. Rolling on the field as Runo is down by contact before the ball came out. Dick holding. Receiving team number 33. That's a 10-yard penalty from the end of the kick. First down. All the better for Tampa Bay, at least for the moment. Two and a half to the end of the third. Brock Purdy's going to be all right. Yeah. Meanwhile, here is Dave Davis. Another reception. Another look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Look at this. Josh Allen tonight, his average time to throw, 2.43 seconds quickest his entire career. So running the football, making quick decisions, facing some man coverage. Moving ahead is James Cook. Should be enough for the first down. The thing I'd love to see tonight is how he has been patient. I think the last three weeks, just his competitive spirit, wanting to make plays, sometimes maybe guilty like a lot of great players, forcing a ball, trying to make a play tonight. He's been incredibly patient, not trying to get it to Diggs. He's spread the ball out, throwing the ball quite a bit as we've seen, especially to Gabe Davis and to Shakir. Buffalo running his 51st play of the night and turning around is Diggs along the sideline. Banks saying it's a catch, and the officials are going to concur. Yeah, it's actually really good coverage by Carlton Davis. I mean, he is, the last couple series, he has been aggressive and tight on Diggs. But look at the location on that back shoulder. And Diggs gets the right foot down immediately. And then the left foot comes down with possession of the football. Blitz. Too high. Over the middle. Gabe Davis, the intended receiver. He's already had a huge night with nine catches. Second and ten. 65 seconds left in the third. Mayfield going over things with the offensive coordinator, Dave Pinellas. Second and ten here. Allen after the fake digs. I don't know. Miscommunication or what? What do you think? Yeah, this is just a quick read. But I think Bills fans are going to fall in love with the playmaking ability of Dalton Kincaid and what he can do with the ball in his hands after the catch. Yeah, Knox originally weren't going to put him on IR, but they did today. And again with Quentin Morris also out. Kincaid is the only listed tight end active tonight. That was quite an answer because Tampa Bay had turned the game on its head. and then 75 yards they go just like that have to lead again to Kaylee. Guys, after that score, Josh Allen made sure to get Dalton Kincaid that ball because it was his first ever NFL touchdown. But we noticed as guys were celebrating Kincaid, Josh Allen would not raise his right arm for a high five. Guys got a bunch of low fives with his left hand. He has been on the injury report for the last two weeks after that Sunday night football game against the Giants because of his right shoulder. He was not limited in practice, but that seems to be the problem here. And we saw him in the tent, of course, when he comes back, throws the pick, and then that drive. Meanwhile, the hole here to the 40-yard line. All of a sudden, the Buccaneers have found a running game. That's White for a game of 15. How about that? How about that hole open up? Just like that. Positive yards. Again, if we keep talking about it, Rashad White has a little bit of room. What he can do with the football. It's his longest game of the season. Takes the swing pass here. Picks up close to eight as we kick down in the two-minute warning. It will be second down and three on the other side of the plow from the 47-yard line. And this is right this time. He's stuffed after a game of one. third down and two. Keep waiting to see 13 get his hands on the football. Three targets in his first half. Only one reception for seven yards. Remember McDermott comes from that old school Philadelphia Eagles Jimmy Johnson school where they don't let the opponent's top offensive threat beat him. They've done a good job here in this first half of shutting him down. On third and three, Mayfield fires caught. And that'll move into first down territory. Godwin making the grab. Dane Jackson with the tackle. Doesn't it feel like Baker again? First year with these receivers who are uber talented. But I just feel like when it's a critical moment, he's looking that way. Soft coverage, good decision. Under a minute. All white juggles. puts a hold of it again, takes it to the 41-yard line. And the first half, you kind of sense, even though it's early in the year, seventh week, both these teams, the stage of the season, the way they've been playing, both need a win. And both are playing as hard as they can to try to get a win and enjoy a nice long weekend. Yep. As we head to November. flag second time that Gedeke has been flagged Big Wick can talk about this better than anybody but you know you're on the road in this kind of environment and you're sitting in that stance and you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting and it just puts a lot, and you're looking across from you, and there's Ed Oliver, and they're showing blitz. They're mugged up. You're trying to communicate. It's a lot to deal with for these offensive linemen. You give Buffalo credit for using the crowd to their advantage and affecting the communication. Mayfield, under pressure. Down he goes in the 46-yard line, and there's Ed Oliver. This last week's game. and final timeout, Tampa Bay. Tampa takes his last timeout. Taryn Johnson also in on it. It'll be third and 15. They walk up pressure here, but the power of Ed Oliver ends up winning at the end of the day. Just a really good job. I mean, think about Cody Mock. This guy's a rookie from North Dakota State. I mean, it's hard enough to be a rookie from an SEC or a Big Ten school. And as a rookie, you're out of your plan in this environment. You're going against Ed Oliver. Been holding up okay. He's getting better each week. But, man, that is a... Taylor Rapp, the former Ram. You can see through his expression he thinks it's on him. Scott Novak is the ref. I'll hear from him. On a deep issue in the 20. That's a spot foul on an automatic. Now, Taylor Rapp, he read this perfectly. It's a big tight end with good size. It's 6'5". He's going to bend into the middle. And there's the read, and he just got there early. Hit him with that left shoulder. Came over the top of the tight end, so the Bucs catch a break. But Taylor Rapp did everything you want to do as a safety. Read it, was in position. It just got a little bit too aggressive there at the end when he played the football. So a 21-yard penalty on a third and five. Toss this time Keyshawn Vaughn He only gets one again That Tampa Bay running game We discussed it a little bit earlier They've got to get something going When it comes to the ground game But Mayfield even said Hey, we're not a running team Yeah, but I think Canales would like to just see Just enough for their running game Especially when teams like Buffalo are going to keep their safeties back and say, listen, we're not going to be heavy in the box. We're going to let you, if you want to run and you can, then we're going to let that happen with our safeties back deep. Now, if you get going too much, then we'll start to have to bring our safeties down. And for Mike Evans and Godwin to have a big night, again, they need something from that run game. Mayfield, that's all he can do to come up with it and then throw it away. So Mayfield avoiding disaster. Micah Hyde that time came blitzing in. He gets it away at third down and nine. Heck, a job by Baker Mayfield just to get it on one. He got it on one bounce, all in one motion, threw that ball out to the right. Watch him. He doesn't have the chance to really even grip it, just grabs it, about to get hit by Coyer, and just fires it off to his right and avoids the intentional grounding. He hopes that somebody's in the neighborhood. Mike Evans, closest receiver over there. Yeah, there's the center. Hange with a high snap. Third down and nine. And Mayfield is going to take the timeout. First charge, timeout. Tampa Bay, 40 seconds. This crowd, I mean, we've seen a few and heard a few crowds in Hawaii. Yeah. Right from the get-go. I mean, it's interesting. You drive into this stadium. They're going to get a new stadium, which is under construction right now, at least the hole in the ground. But the last mile, there's tailgate party after tailgate party. Oh, my God. Again, it reminds me of like a college atmosphere as far as the buildup and hype. The difference is it's a Thursday night. I think it's a half day today. It's like a holiday, half day at school. Everybody takes off work today and tomorrow, four-day weekend. I mean, they love their bills. It's cool. Oh, yeah, they'll be taking off tomorrow for sure. No doubt about that. Recovery. Third and nine. Mayfield hangs in the pass. It's caught, but a little short of the first down. Mike Evans stopped there by Micah Hyde. So the first decision coming up here for Bowles and company, and they're going to send in the field goal group to try to tie the game. Chase McLaughlin coming in. Like Mayfield, he's been around. Loughlin's seven teams in the last five years was with the Colts last year. This will be a 50-yarder. Camarda, the hold. And the kick is no good. Not even close. And that will give Allen and company the ball at their own 40-yard line. Remains 3-0. Buffalo. And Shaq Lawson gets a mid on it. And it remains 3-0. So good field position now for Allen and company. At the 40-yard line. And not in Sun Valley. James Cook is the running back. Play action. Allen stepping away. Fires at the 44-yard line. Taken in by Stephon Diggs. Well, there it is. You know, we were with Kansas City, and we saw Mahomes and Kelsey do this. Watch what you see. Very similar as far as the way he creates. Okay, the plays. D-surgery last year. Made only six snaps last week. That's caught over the middle. Ball is out at the 50-yard line, and it's ruled incomplete. So Jordan Poyer put the hit on the tight end, Cade Otten, and fortunately for the Buccaneers, it was ruled incomplete. And there is Wirfs who need some time. Yeah, they put three safeties on the field with Taylor Rapp coming in to play back deep. It allows Poyer to play up tight where he can make a play like that on the big tight end that didn't knock that football loose. defense flying around here on this first series at home looking a lot better than they have in previous weeks Jake Camarda has the best average in the league 52.9 yards per punt coming into the game Deontay Hardy lines up at the 10 yard line high booming kick he's going to let it bounce and it takes a perfect bounce for Tampa Bay put a little backspin on it Josh Hayes down to Deere, that's a 53 yard putt, his average here comes it was everything they thought it would be you're trying to coach him up which side is he going to look at I love that, I love my angle for us Latavius Murray is in the backfield you've got Allen taking the snap Kincaid is back there too. Allen to the outside. Open man. First down out to the 18-yard line goes Khalil Shakir. Second year man out of Boise State. Had four receptions Sunday at New England. And the Bills are going to go no huddle. Allen again. Great completion percentage. 71%. 2-1 ratio. He's thrown nine touchdowns in this stadium with only one pick. His problems have come on the road. He's going to keep it. Quarterback draw. And the crowd loves it because the narrative in Buffalo is, why isn't he running more the way he used to? Everybody wants to see the big man run, and I think it's been by design the last couple years to try to take some of the wear and tear off of him. But very early here, second play of the game, Here's that design run, and you can see the damage he can do. That's a first and 10 play. Now it's second and two. Very positive yards there. Eight-yard gain for the 6'5", 237-pound quarterback. Looks to his left, comes to his right, picks up another first down. Secure breaks a tackle. Secure staying in bounds. Secure takes it to midfield. some back-to-back receptions for him that's 21 yards yeah the defensive backs here is he in playing zone he's he's got it right near the boundary he's got to be able to make that play use the leverage to his advantage and just push him out of bounds he gave up to completion that's fine but you got to make that play right there great effort they're kind of looking for that third compliment to Diggs and Davis and this big tight end Kincaid. It could be Shakir tonight. Again, a floater, and this time that's caught along the sidelines there. Gabe Davis over the head of Jamel Dean. So Allen's just like that taking them from their own four all the way down to the Tampa Bay 38. And now they go zone, and then they drop into some man coverage. This tempo, aggressive approach. You're seeing a quarterback run. You're seeing some great throws. This is the rhythm that's been missing with Buffalo. Five wide. Send an extra man this time. Caught along the sideline here. Staying inbounds and then out of bounds. After he makes the catches, Dave Davis, their number two receiver, and, of course, number one, Stephon Diggs. Again, if you're a Buffalo fan watching this, not only are you happy to see this ball moving right down the field, But right now, we've not seen his number one target, Stephon Diggs. We want to watch it. Even the Buffalo coach is telling us, first series, we find out how teams are defending Diggs. And then we can go from there. On the ground, Latavius Murray, who's their number two back. James Cook is the starter. But Murray, who's been around a long time, 10 years in the league at 33, he's the oldest active running back in the NFL. No huddle again. It's Chalvin at left side actually the center Mitch Morris pulled around there made a nice block to open that hole up Allen flushed out chased And this flings it away Tampa Bay spending a lot of attention on digs at least so far in this game He's had opportunities to win One-on-one at that time was nobody there in coverage in zone Targeted four times. Four receptions. Allen throws. Short game here. Again, Davis makes this catch, and Jamel Dean is right there to stop him. Gain a two-second and eight. You just know at some point, especially in plus territory, 14 who's had a quiet night up to this point, at some point he's going to get a chance to get one-on-one, and when he gets one-on-one, he's going to win it. And you know that Josh Allen's looking and waiting for that opportunity. To the ground. Nice hole there for James Cook. Ball at the 36, third down and two. He's a good-looking back. You lose Devin Singletary, and James Cook goes from 1-B to becoming the premier guy now in this backfield, to complement what Allen in a passing game can do. Hands into family with foot. There he is again. Moves to six. First down to the 31-yard line. Neal makes the stop. Four and a half to go to the half. I think right now what you've got to like to see is just so far it's been a clean game for Buffalo. You know, not getting behind the sticks, doing a good job of executing in the run game, being patient, not trying to force the ball when it's not there. Continuing to be patient until you get the home run shot is going to be a big part of what they need to do tonight to put points on the board. Diggs. Down the sideline he goes. Stephon Diggs making his third catch of the night. That's a first down. Carlton Davis will follow him over. So you got man coverage. There he is. And that's another thing they've done is, you know, he's lined up outside. He's lined up in the slot. They motion him. They put him in a bunch. They put him in a stack. They're just trying to do anything that they can to create matchups and create confusion for Tampa's defense. Uptempo again. Pass. Well, not on the same page that time. Davis not looking back. It'll be second down and 10 from the 20-yard line. Buffalo 224 yards in this half. We're at that red zone area again where it's good against good. And I think it'll go a long way determining who wins this game. If they're scoring touchdowns or settling field goals, Josh Allen and his legs were a big factor last time they were down here. Cook, that didn't fool anybody. Takes a couple of steps. Winfield is right there in the backfield. Short loss. Third down and 11. They bring Murray in for Cook more than anything to help out with pass protection. It's the third down and 12. Reset the play clock. Pressure again. Runs away from it. Throws on the run. Caught! Touchdown! Dalton Kincaid! 22 yards for the rookie, their first-round draft choice out of Utah. Boy, did Josh Allen do a great job of baiting Levante David, who is as good as there is in coverage. But after that last touchdown run, now he's concerned about the threat of Josh Allen and what he can do with his legs. Once he gets out here, watch the potential threat of him running. David's thinking going to take that away, and it opens up the throw right behind it. Good job again. Patience by Josh Allen. Bates the backer out of position and makes a good throw for the touchdown. That's the point after. First touchdown of Kincaid's career, 17-10, and we're back in. You're always concerned about what he can do. Shows blitz, drops, and great position. Great position, but now he steps up. It's going to stop him from running. And I'll tell you, the more you watch 86 in this offense, and I know they've had Dawson, tough-ass one-on-one matchup against a powerful bull rush from Ed Oliver. A long way from Fargo. Right. Third and 15. Three over the middle, and that to the 41-yard line goes Cade Otten. So it's fourth down. clock still running Buffalo do they want to take a timeout here Tampa doesn't have any and now they're going to send in the punt group so Buffalo they're going to try to kick a field goal here well I guess sure might as well give it a shot we started to mention this before timeout Buffalo 30 second timeout 19 seconds on the game clock so Buffalo takes a timeout we were talking about Chase McLaughlin, who through the years, he's been around, as we said before, with seven teams in five years, from 40 to 49 yards out in the last several years, he's made less than 50%. You put him 50 and beyond, he's made 83%. Yeah, and he drilled one tonight from 57, 20 a distance. The other one was 50, and it was tipped. Can he do it again here? 59-yard attempt. Well, they're not even going to try. They line up to try to get Buffalo to come across the line. And that would have given him the first down, but the Bills are smarter than that. Yeah, the long snapper didn't even have his hands on the football. So I don know what the heck if you trying to draw him off he didn have his hands on the ball Exactly He said no no I think we good Yeah, well, there's no... Yeah, the center is... He can't even snap it. Right. Well, they did enough of a fake shot to take a few seconds off before Buffalo took its time out. So now Camarda Descended down toward the end zone And that one will bounce through it So with 11 seconds Buffalo at the 25 And we're back in 30 seconds E2M 17-10 Buffalo. And the Bills are going to get the ball to start the second half. Going to kneel down here within the first 30 minutes of competition. Good half. What a fun stuff. Seven-point game. Heading to halftime. Coming up after the game, State Farm halftime show from Buffalo. They'll turn this team around In his seventh season And away we go with Buffalo To take control In the third quarter And they'll start at the 25 yard line And Kaylee with Sean McDermott Well, Coach, you seem to involve nearly everyone in your offense in the first half. How were you able to do that? Well, I think we got into a rhythm. You know, we went a little bit of no huddle there. Josh was moving us down the field and just got into a good rhythm overall. We know that Josh's right shoulder was evaluated in the medical tent during the first half. How will that impact your play calling in the second half? No, he's fine. No, he's fine. He's back in there. He's ready to go. Thank you, Coach. he is indeed as he starts this half with play action the pass over the middle that's going to be a gain of 19 as Dalton Kincaid the rookie Michaels and Herbstreit here a penny for your well maybe a little bit more for your thoughts well I think the fact he just said that they've been in rhythm offensively that's what's been missing for these guys since the Miami game in week four so I think that's a great way to start this game. We've seen this offense in flow because of this man right here in command, making good decisions, throwing the football, and also as we've seen, him using his legs to make plays. A situation where Reggie Gilliam now will have to play more and more tonight and help him set that edge. And Ryan Vandermark, the backup tackle, and this time through the middle for a first down to the 11-yard line. crowd wants to know where was that you called for it on the air even when we went to break thinking if there's ever a guy with the push tush at 17 with his size and his knack for making plays with his feet 6'5", 240 pounds he'll get you a yard from the 11 on first down uh oh going LeBron here let's see what this is, this is a touchdown slam dunk Allen flushed out chased gets tripped up nice play there by Yaya Diaby you gotta love that name Yaya Diaby a rookie out of Louisville you love that name of course I love that he has this kind of quickness because how many times in his career have we seen Josh Allen pump it's not there go to his right flush to his right and then outrun that edge defender and find somebody open in the end zone. Does it every week. But great speed there to not give up the edge by Diaby. Allen's going to run it. Kraft loves it. Touchdown. 13 yards on the second of 12. There it is. That's what's been missing. And I don't just think it's the production and how it fits into the scheme. I think it gets Josh Allen into the game. I just think when he's running and he's making plays, he just seems to play at a different level. And I think his mindset's at a different level. the execution, the confidence, the toughness that he plays with. And the fan base yearning for it. Passes extra point. Good. Return sets it up after the short punt. And Buffalo leads 10-0 on Thursday night. Of this potentially happening, so they clear out. They don't even think about Josh Allen. Now this is not a draw. You don't see blockers getting downfield. This is recognition by Josh Allen. Seeing those backers clear. Takes off. A little pump fake just to keep the defense honest, even though he's five yards downfield. Look at him. Look at those backers. Great vision. Does this completely on his own. This is the aspect of the offense the last three weeks we've not seen a lot of. And when they get down to the 10-yard line and number 17 takes off, he is tough to stop. He acknowledges the crowd. You want me to run? I'm running. There it is. there's a fair catch fall for at the five yard line it means it automatically goes to the 25 and automatically we go to Kaylee Al, Tristan Wirth has not missed a snap at left tackle but he's been getting some work from the training staff in between series, you saw him go into the blue tent I'm told he has a quad contusion and you might notice he's got some extra padding protecting his right thigh he's back in there and they really need him Filer, they're starting left guard, he's out tonight There's Wurst lining up on first down. Rashad White is the running back. Here is Rashad White. The jersey of Johnson. And it was, again, for Buccaneer fans, they're thinking, oh, my gosh. We finally had a positive run from Rashad White. He's a very talented, capable back. He just hasn't had a lot of room to work. He's out. Keyshawn Vaughn is now in. He's the running back. It's first and 13. And another flag here. Full start. Offense number 67. This time it's the right tackle. So they were going to be at the 15 without the penalty. Now they're back at the 48. First and 18. 8.40 to the half fills up 10-0 Mayfield and that's too low and incomplete second and long from the 23 yard line Latavius Murray Halfway through the third quarter Bill's trying to go to 5-3 Tampa Bay trying to get above 500 Quick toss. Tavius gets up to the 29-yard line. Ryan Neal puts him down there. Third down and four. The third down defense for Tampa Bay has been not great all year. They're dead last in the league. 32nd, allowing 50% conversions. And tonight, Bills had hit four and six on their third downs. Big play here for Tampa's team. Not great is an understatement. Third and four. Bunch to the left. Three receivers all going up. Allen going that way. Allen throwing against the grain. And that's along the sideline. And it is caught at the 49-yard line. Kincaid. Boy, he's making his mark in a hurry. What an adjustment. We just talked about how Josh Allen likes to roll to his right. This time he rolls to his left. But I love is the rookie against Levante David. That was not the design of the route. That's him adjusting to the quarterback who started to scramble. And he's able to turn upfield and then make a great catch and get two feet down. Kid plays like a veteran, even though he's a rookie. 15 yards. Chicken burn on third down. Pressure put on this time. Again, the catch in front of the Buffalo bench. Made there. Diggs balling it in. Dean makes the tackle. He had a five. Big, big series for both these teams. I mean, Buffalo's starting to pull away here. About five and a half to go into third. And if you're Tampa right now, down 14, you cannot allow points on this drive. Hey, 97, 97. 97. Sugar, sugar. Sugar, sugar. Oh, my God. Throws an Omaha through everything. He had it all covered. Deep downfield and too deep intended for Stefan Diggs. A little bit out of his reach. Incomplete third down and five with five minutes to go in the quarter. That was a heck of a battle. back into the boundary with Dean and Diggs. See that pushing back and forth, both guys pushing on each other. Diggs with a little push to try to create that separation at the top of the route there. Another third down. They're 5-7 on the night. Window, window, window. Fired. Incomplete. Could have been very close to a first down. Allen looks around, wants a flag, doesn't find one. Carlton Davis, good coverage at that time on Stephon Dix fourth down. This is where Dix just has the option to just kind of work the leverage of the defender. And quarterback's holding on as long as he can. He went in, he went back out, he goes back in. And Davis holding on there as long as he can himself in coverage on an island against one of the best receivers in the league. And, of course, Allen wants that he got in there a little bit early for the pass interference. Sam Martin in. First time that we've seen him tonight. First punt for the Bills. Buccaneers have punted four times. Angled. Bounces it to three. And spins out at about that point. Can't do any better. Perfect. Tampa. Deep in its own territory. down by 14. Buck start with Chase Edmonds in the backfield as the running back from the three. Give it to him. Just off injured reserve. Stopped there for a game of one second down and nine. Can't help but go back to Sean McDermott. And this looks like Buffalo Bills football. We got into town and everybody, whether it's the media, the fans, you mentioned in the open, even the players feeling some anxiety over the last three weeks after a really good start to the season and the win over Miami, and it haven't looked that good. You knew it was just completely taking him away, but watch him now work to find that opening, continue to work into the view to be able to get that ball completed downfield. To the outside, trying to set up a little bit of a screen here. The Tampa Bay's there, and a flag comes in. Got a holding there on Shurfield. Right, number 16. trying to pave the way for Davis. That's coming back. Offense number 16. That's a 10-yard penalty. First down. So, going to move it back. Meanwhile, you got worse. There he is hobbling around on the sideline. He has made the move from right tackle where he was one of the best in the league, the left tackle this year. And if you look at his numbers, he's regarded as one of the best here in the first half of the season in pass protection in the entire league. That's a tough move. From right to left so hopefully he'll be okay. Keep an eye on that If he can't come back that would be down two starters. Meanwhile grabbed there By Davis, boy Allen can really fling it Davis hangs on second down and make it second down and ten Good job of reading that quick blitz by Devin White got the ball out of his hands quickly They know that today with Todd Bowles they said he'll blitz anywhere anytime time. We've got to be ready not just with pass protection, but with side adjusts and Hots, too. Coming again. He had a free runner there, but he gets it away. That's caught by James Cook. And Cook will set up a third down and medium as Levante David makes the tackle. He talked about the free runner. It was Devin White again on the blitz. One thing I'm sure Todd Bowles looked at on a short week was Bill Belichick and the Patriots attacked the right side of Ken Dorsey's offensive line. and here in the early going, they're testing that right side's communication with some Devin White glitzing and trying to get some free runners. Two and a half to go, still going up tempo. This time the protection is fabulous, and the pass is two inside the ten. Shakir makes the grab, so Allen at all the time in the world. Shakir gets free near the sideline, first and goal, being a 30. Yeah, it's like a matchup zone where they just do not pass over coverage. When the receiver goes from one side, works all the way across to the other, it's just a bust in coverage. Good job of seeing that, and Al, you touched on it. Give the offensive line, the much maligned offensive line, a lot of credit for giving Allen the time he needed to find that. First and goal, taking it to the floor. He gets halfway home. is Gene Cook to set up a second down and goal with the clock kicking down to 140. Josh Allen, 10 of 11. The only incompletion was the throwaway. I mean, he is feeling it in his zone, was hoping he'd see blitzing today. We brought up, you know, Todd Bowles and his reputation as a defense that's going to bring it. He kind of said that, so he kind of smirked and said, I like when they blitz. He's one of the best quarterbacks in the country or in the NFL when they blitz. Well, they've had huge problems getting off to quick starts, but not so far tonight. And a little shovel pass, and taking it to the goal line and stopped just short of it there, is the tight end Kincaid. So it's the old shovel, third down and goal from inside the one. It's like just short. It's a great call by the officials there. We love that play. He's reading that defensive end, Levante David, and if he stays wide, he pitches it underneath, has that pulling guard leading the way. Came very close to getting that one in. So take it out of the gun and give it to Murray, and Murray gets stuffed. Boy, you would think of all the teams that could run the tush push with a 6'5", 237 pound quarterback, they'd be the one, right? Instead, Allen takes it out of the shotgun. You know penetration this is keep in mind again. We said at the beginning of this game Tampa Bay strength and defense has been in the red zone They're the tops in the entire league is stopping teams from scoring touchdowns down in this area They don't have to run a play here if they don't want to before the end of the quarter And they'll take it the other way to the big fourth down coming up What do you expect here? I expect the quarterback to run the football So that was moments ago you heard what he expects let's see what they do here on a fourth down and goal Throws knocked away So once again Tampa Bay and Kirk talking about how they stiffen in the red zone Dean bats it away here Go to Philly big one and then the bye week 13 move Evans now off to the right they put those three receivers to the left of Baker Mayfield they just flip flip the field Godwin wide left Mayfield look out and off balance throws and White will have to get out of bounds and he does with eight seconds That was Vaughn Miller just holding on to his left leg. I didn't think he would get out of that somehow, some way. Of course, you bring in your pass rush specialist, even though he's still getting healthy. He's just grabbing on behind. And the rodeo move. Eight seconds. Play clock at five. A bunch of laterals. What do we see here? Well, instead, you've got four seconds. Evans makes the catch. It's still at the 40-yard line and 60 yards away from the end zone. So this will be Baker's last last Pete Ho here. Barring a penalty. Barring a defensive foul should be it. The way that last possession hit, you're right. You don't know. Anything's in play. You don't know. Could see a few laterals here, too. That's the other option. Meanwhile, it's blown dead. I think they get another five yards here. Because Von Miller in dire need of another sack. We were talking to him the other day. Defense number 40, unabated to the quarterback. It's a five-yard penalty. First down. So the MVP of Super Bowl 50 when he played with the Broncos has the ball moved to the 45, so 55 yards away. Yeah, that's a big deal. Could be. When you're going to try to throw it 55 or 60 yards, try to get a tip ball, and you've got a guy like Mike Evans with his size, you know, at 6'5", he picks up five more yards. The Bills have five guys standing inside the 10-yard line. Five. Mayfield dancing all around. Throw as far as he can throw it. Jump ball coming. Crazy stuff. Not this time. Incomplete. Somehow, I don't know if anybody touched that football. I don't think so either. One of the rare times it's not batted by somebody. Somehow, someway, that ball hits the ground. I thought Chris Godwin was the closest 14. I just don't think he ever really located the football. By the time he looks up, look at that. If he would have looked earlier, he catches that ball. We've got a couple Buffalo guys on the ground, and Godwin's right there. He just didn't look up and see the football. What was crazy? Oh, just at the last second, Al, he sees it. You can call penalties on a bunch of guys here if you really wanted to, But look at this crazy stuff. And that's the way it ends. And the Buffalo Bills go to 5-3. The Tampa Bay Bucks go to 3-4. As the Bills win it by a score of 24-18. And that is the story, at least as far as the game is concerned, from Orchard Park. But a lot more ahead as the JCPenney post-game show. comes your way right after these messages. Again in traffic. Mayfield again is going to go down at the 46-yard line. So fourth down, last gas. coming up. Taron Johnson took him down. They fire up the pressure there and a really good job of getting off on the left side there again by Epinesa. You bring that nickel back. I think it's... Watch how quick he is off the ball. We just talked about power to speed. That flashes in your blind side. I think that impacts Baker as much as Taron Johnson coming in to get him. You know, the clock has been a killer here. It's almost a six-minute drive, and they've only got half the field. Fourth down play. Can they keep it alive? No. But another flag, so maybe they do keep it alive. While the quarterback's in the pocket, legal contact on the defense number seven. It's a five-yard penalty and an automatic first down. Okay, so that, instead of a turnover on downs, that's Johnson again. Aggressive player. 192 pounds. Really more of a safety play in this spot, but he does a good job in coverage. He'll blitz him, as we saw the previous play. Here he's locked up there with the rookie, Palmer, and so the Bucs catch a break, get the first down. There they go Johnson's way a lot, but he made the play of his career, 101-yard pick six off Lamar Jackson in a wild card game here in 2020. 4-0-7 to play. Mayfield fires over the middle, and that's dropped inside the 20-yard line. Payne Durham, who is the backup tight end's first time, he has seen one come his way tonight. Yeah, 6'5", 255, and a rare man-to-man situation. One-on-one with the veteran Micah Hyde, and he's got his body between the ball and the defender. Ball's put right on his chest. Hyde does a good job coming around him to knock it loose, but, boy, you'd love to see him just use that body and hold on to that football. They feel to the outside Then he gets slung down But inbounds is Micah Hyde Taking down Cade Otten Clock keeps rolling You sit here thinking Where are the playmakers at this point? Where's Godwin? Where's Evans? Think about who he's thrown the ball to here lately Palmer, Otten Payne Durham, the rookie Bills taking away Evans taking away Godwin forcing him to throw elsewhere well you think you know you mentioned going with alacrity but the play clock is down 5-4 on a drive where they need not only get in the end zone but get there quickly Mayfield hit as he throws that's incomplete Greg Russo put the heat on that time and another fourth down play coming up How about Russo moving inside on some of these plays? You know, they've got some injuries to the interior. Russo, who is really a long defensive end at 6'6", 265 pounds, but has shown the ability and versatility to go down inside. He did that on this last play, and you touched on it, Al. He hits Baker right as he releases the football. Gets your best pass rushers on the field when you can kick him down. And the Bills defense doing what they had to do. They made him on 13 plays for 53 yards and take half the quarter. And Mayfield is going to go down, and that's going to pretty much right a finish to it. Jordan Phillips, rig number 97, takes him down on a fourth down play, but another flag. So. They get a face mask in? Yeah, they got him. Talking about catching another break. Wow, that's two fourths down penalty. Face mask on the defense number 97. The 15-yard penalty and an automatic. Goes down. Twice. Yeah. Boy, Sean McDermott has been playing a lot of zone, rushing four, occasionally throwing some blitz in, but this time overloads the right side, brings four against three. Nothing Tampa could have done to stop that except a face mask. Exactly. Mayfield dancing around. Fires wide open. There's Evans. Sooner or later, you knew that Evans had to make a long one, but, but, but, a flag. And they're coming back. Yeah, the rookie, Ma. Offense number 69. That's a 10-yard penalty. They finally get the ball to Mike Evans. Finally, they don't keep their eye on 13. And I know he's had a frustrating night. Watch the right guard, the rookie from North Dakota State, matched up against Phillips in pretty good position, but then takes him down. You couldn't see. He grabbed a hold of his jersey. Helmet comes off. So that negates that. Makes it a first and 20. Back of the 14. Shoots a pass here to Chase Edmonds. Up to the 24. He goes. Second and long. Tyrell Dotson makes the tackle. These yards will go down from Baker Maythorne to the pass game, but that, again, is a run play. You get the center out in front, Hainsey, get the ball out to the edge quickly. What's the difference between that and an outside zone play? It's just instead of relying on setting the edge and running the football where you're not having success, you just flip it out there to him. Second and 11. Mayfield steps away. Shoots it out here to Edmonds again. Starts to stumble. Maintains his balance up to the 30-yard line. We'll be third down and four. And now it feels like we're at that point in the game when you're down a couple scores. A little bit more urgency from Tampa. You know, I'm sure Dave Canales would love to see. He's got to start cranking that up a little bit. 14 points. You know, and Buffalo's thinking, and even though it's eight minutes to go, you're still thinking, hey, keep it in front of us. If I give up completions underneath, it's just tackle them inbounds, let that clock keep working. Yeah, taking too much time off that play clock. That's caught, and that's going to be a first down, and getting to the 40 is Rashad White. A little over seven minutes down to play. There it is again. You know, watch Baker Mayfield's eyes. wants to get the ball downfield, but quickly goes down. It's really the last two or three weeks. I don't know how many times he's checked it down to White like that. Now they go no huddle. Mayfield slings it to the outside. And that is going to be ruled as a catch. Rockham Jarrett tackled there by Benford. If he caught this, I don't know if they're going to take a peek at this. This is unreal. Wow. Well, good for him. He got it. Yeah, too late for a challenge anyway. And that'll be a first down here. And then Cade Ott in the tight end. Hustling up to the line of scrimmage. So this drive started back at their own eight. Moved it into Buffalo territory. Now they go. Now they're going a little faster here. Now they're starting to get. Now that they've gotten deep away from their own goal line. Now they're starting to get some first downs and go a little bit faster. Have to. Oh, yeah. Mayfield comes this way to the 40-yard line. That's caught there by Trey Palmer. Second down. Buffalo not necessarily playing prevent but doing a good job of just sinking their corners and safeties Really the only thing that Baker Mayfield can do right now is either check it down to the back wide or hit these underneath throws to his receivers. Buffalo making him take a lot of time off that clock. 5.45. Mayfield stepping up, dancing, look out. They second the 45-yard line, A.J. Vanessa. He moves around and has such speed. Watch to the top of the screen there. Works around, again, his college buddy. Went to Iowa. What I love is he attacks the football. We were talking this morning in our meeting. You know, he showed up as a rookie, more of a power rusher out of Iowa at 280. He worked himself down to 260 pounds. Now he's much more of a speed rusher off that edge. Third and nine. Mayfield. Of a blitz and aborting a run pass option. So he sees this immediately and just gets off of that handoff immediately. Thinks he's got a matchup, which if the ball's thrown accurately, you get the ball into the hands of Diggs and you've got a blocker in front of him. Third and ten. Look out. And they blow the plate dead. Allen really wanted that free play. That was Kalijah Canci, their number one pick out of Pittsburgh. Neutral zone interaction on the defense in the 94. He did too good a job with that hard count. He did. Just pull him off a little bit, and you maybe get that free play instead. Dawkins makes contact with him. So third down and five. So Bobby Wagner's over here. Ray Nitschke will be next. Third and five. Allen stepping up. There he goes again. Running for a first down. Sliding to his stop right in front of the bench. You're going to play man coverage. and you're going to leave a lot of room open for Josh Allen. Look at the middle of the field. You know, you're going to rush five, which is fine. Somebody's got to get home, but look at this. Look at the middle of the field, and look at all the defenders. Backs turned, playing man coverage, and Josh Allen just too good and too much of a threat on third down. You've got to spy him there. Big hole. Nine-yard game. James Cook. Ten carries, 53 yards. That's a nice 5.3 average, and that's going to take us to the final quarter. The guy who's having a heck of a game is center, Mitch Morse, the veteran. Doing a really good job of controlling 10s. Well, one more play. And Allen wishes he had taken it to the fourth quarter. He didn't need that. Sack here. Anthony Nelson into three. 20, Bailey Hartung. third and 11 as we start the fourth and the pass will take it to the 42 yard line. Biggs making that grab and it's fourth down for Buffalo. They're holding on by the skin of their teeth here right this defense doing just enough there on that third down Buffalo I think they sense here now that we're starting the fourth quarter this 14 point lead maybe take a shot here and play the analytics game and try to keep this drive alive fourth down and four lineup to go for it that hard count trying to draw him off if nothing else Bucks holding the ground in the putt crowd wanted to go for the kill here want to gamble with my chips The way their punter's been punting and the way this defense has been playing pin them back. Playing with house money? Yeah. That's a miss. By the way, there's no such thing as house money. It's in your rack. It's your money. I've been there. I digress. Not very often, but I've had a couple. Here's Sam Martin, the punk. Devin Tompkins back at the 10-yard line. Martin's last punt was a beauty. Spun it out of bounds inside the three. This one will bound at the six. And goes sideways. Play your punt. Again. Play your punt. There you go. Leave a 96-yard. He started the last drive at the three and this one at the four. Yeah, third time they've been inside their own five-yard line. Tough to sustain drives against this Bills defense in this environment. Mayfield, look out, in the end zone! Just does get it away. So the Bills will line up. They thought they had a sack, but Mayfield shifts in time. Pulling on the field. That's Puna Ford. See that right knee? Looks like it's still in the air. There's a great look at it right here. Boy, he keeps it up. Barely. But clearly. Up into the air by Jordan Phillips and into the arms of Cade Otten. and now here's the penalty after the touchdown, after the two-pointer that's 60 right there in the middle yep, and that means the kickoff now comes from the 20-yard line and you'll have a run back from the 14 by Shakir, and then he'll just slide to a stop at the 24 and now Buffalo, if nothing else, can make Tampa Bay use its timeouts They have three plus the two-minute warning. I mean, we talked about that drive, killing a lot of the clock, lack of urgency early, but to give credit to Tampa for somehow, someway, they had help from Buffalo with the two penalties on two fourth downs. But give them credit. They got it in zone. They hit the two-pointer, and now you've got a six-point game, and you've got a two-minute warning with three timeouts. Josh Allen and Ken Dorsey, are they aggressive? Are they going to run the ball? You've got to be careful being too conservative here running the football. Answer coming up. They start with a run. To the 27 goes James Cook. And the Buccaneers will take a timeout. And we can tell you that away from tonight, we go to Pittsburgh, where it will be the Tennessee Titans against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday Night Football. Steelers just week after week finding a way to win. Yeah. Went out to Los Angeles last week. One out there. Two great coaches. Great personalities. That'll be a lot of fun getting ready to see that one. Always love watching T.J. Watt, right? For sure. Relentless. And Derrick Henry if we see him. Yeah. If he's still there. If he's still there. Big positive yards there on that first and ten play. So second down and six. Tampa, you're loading up, right? You're flying downhill as a backer. They get to Cook. Rolling, pumping, faking, sliding down. Stayed inbounds at the 30-yard line to make the Buccaneers use another timeout. If they so choose. And they do. Second charge timeout. It's such an interesting game on so many levels. You know, Tampa Bay flipping the script early on, Buffalo answering. And don't forget, this game at one point, there was a scare thrown into all of the Buffalo fans when Josh Allen goes into the tent. Yeah, and he came back pretty quickly and didn't even miss a snap. But it was a little bit of a scare because we're finally seeing him go back to being Josh Allen. You know, the coaches have talked about how have been somewhat protective of him this year because they don't want him to get to December and January when playoff football comes around and he's at 80 or 90%. They want him as close as they can be to 100%. Problem is, you've got to play winning football to get to where you want to be in the postseason. He's turned it up tonight. Big play here. Third and five. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm learning. Play clock at four. I'm learning. Fired. Caught. Big first down. To the 43-yard line he goes. You know they're going to bring pressure. But is it just going to be Lamonte David? This is just a quick hot. So you know this might come. But here's the pressure right here. Is he in the nickelback? Once he blitzes, great recognition. Easy throw for Josh Allen. So Todd Bowles rolls the dice here. Tries to bring that pressure. tries to catch Josh Allen sleeping, but if he sees it, it's easy. There's no one there to take your best receiver, one of the best receivers in the league, for that first down. And the Bucs take their final timeout on the front side of the two-minute. Nice little hole here, 49-yard line. James Cook takes us to the two-minute warning. Boy, is he good. And we can tell you as we start week number eight what's ahead this weekend. You've got the Rams going to Dallas in the early window on Fox. And then later on, Cincinnati at San Francisco. Let's see about Purdy and company. That's CBS's late game. The Sunday night is out in L.A. where the Chargers trying to get out of their own way, take on the Bears, who won last week. and the Monday nighter is Vegas going to Detroit. Take on the Lions. We're down to 3-0-4. 14th play of a drive that began back at the 8-yard line. Mayfield to the end zone and incomplete. Mike Evans there, coverage was good Passed a little deep Second down Benford ends up knocking his ball away And I don't know if it would have counted I don't know if Evans gets his feet down He's just working to the back of the end zone The safety is there But watch Benford, who you mentioned earlier He's the one who comes in late on this football Evans gets his hands on And then right there I don't think he would have been able to hold on to it But you appreciate the effort there by 47 Playing that all the way through could knock that loose. A second year guy out of Villanova. Injury plagued rookie season last year. Second and ten. Pressure. That's incomplete over the middle of the 20 yard line. Trying to get it to Cade Ott. The tight end is third down at ten. Dialed it up again. Seven that time coming. They bring one more than they have to handle. That's why he gets the ball out quickly but that safety came down. Good job. Great execution by the Bills there. Bring one more, know the ball's going to get out quick for a hot, and with the safety down, I think it was Tyler Rapp that time, took away the option. Mayfield to the outside, knocked away along the sideline, there's that man, Benford again, fourth down. Benford, it's not just big for tonight, it's big for the duration of who they can be as a defense. You know, he has shown what he can do, he's been out there at times, playing on that side of the field. Ball's thrown late and behind. It makes it a little bit easier here to make that play. But when he looks back at the film tonight, he's going to be happy with his performance. Godwin, one catch in the second half. Evans, none. Can they pick up a first down here? First charge, timeout. Buffalo, 30 seconds timeout. Take a timeout. One of the weirdest drives we've ever seen here. 16 plays, 68 yards, 7 minutes and 14 seconds. It's just what Buffalo wanted. I mean, obviously, he'd like to get off the field on those four downs, but if you're going to keep moving the football and keep working the clock, dinking and dunking, no problem. Josh Allen said, I'm getting impatient, but on the sideline here about 20 minutes. So Mayfield is 21 out of 37. 193 yards. They've had a fourth and ten, a fourth and eight. Buffalo penalized on both. Now it's a fourth and ten. One last guess. and that is going to be caught for a touchdown by Mike Evans. We ain't done yet. No, we're not. Wow. Just when you think they're done, they keep coming up with plays on fourth down. A couple penalties, one-on-one matchup on a deep crosser. That ball bounces off of Benford's helmet. You talk about concentration by Mike Evans. Look where he starts here. On the right, good protection. Now he's got to separate and pull away, which he's capable of doing. But the thing they'll have to catch was the ball going off of the helmet at Benford. That's a quick ricochet and the concentration in the hands to catch that. So here's a situation where if you go for two, which they are doing here, you know exactly what you need as opposed to just tying the game and then getting a TD and trying to figure out what you want to do at the end. So can they make it a six-point lead? Mayfield, looking, looking, comes back across the middle, tipped and caught with a conversion. So, Otten takes it in, and it's 24-18. Yeah, now you know exactly what you need. Hang in there, gang. Don't touch that dial. We'll be back. We promise. By Mike Evans. It's super, super slow-mo. That ball bounces off of Benford into his arms. What a reaction for a guy that's been frustrated. Outstanding on a fourth down play for the Bucs. And then here's the two-pointer. Another ball. It's tipped. Second attempt. Mayfield. In trouble again. buys room takes it out close to the 10 yard line third down the combination there the coverage downfield just nowhere to go with that football second play in a row and eventually that pressure gets to him at least he was able to roll out of there at least get some positive yards gives him at least a chance here on third down stepping up oh knock down almost pick Poyer was right there came close but broke it up anyway fourth down so a very fast three it out And Poirier's been doing this on third down. This time he's actually back as a safety. He's been lining up a lot as a backer on third down. All he's doing is feeling Baker Mayfield and seeing that crosser. Just almost, again, throw it to him. Throw it to him. Steps in front. Baker looked very hesitant, very indecisive. And boy, did Poirier come close to a pick six there. Jake Kamarduk came into the game leading the league. And throws punting average, 52.9. He's averaged 50.4 tonight. This is his sixth punt, and this one is a beauty to the 26-yard line. And then bringing it back to the 45-yard line with a flag is Deontay Hardy. 63-yard kick. And the Bills are moving back. Turn, holding, receiving team number 39. That's a 10-yard penalty for this ball to the ball. Push down, timeout. 12.58 left in regulation. Bill's on top 20. From the 33-yard line. Players begin this drive. Can chew up some clock along the way. For the long drive, James Cook tackling about the line of scrimmage by William Golston. Canales still trying to make adjustments Still trying to fight Keep their offense Having opportunities If they can get the ball back here Try to cut into this lead Jay Field Who is that? Allen fires. Caught on the run, on the move. Shakir. A little Shakir. Big night for him, too. That is six catches on six targets. 92 yards. He comes all the way across here. And this crosser, kind of a mesh route here where you had Kinkade and he coming. And it's against the zone. So a lot of times those crossers like that work best against man. But against the zone, quarterback's got to have great accuracy, especially when the receiver's working his way, not settling, but still coming across. High snap, pulls it down. Diggs. Stop it. After a very short game. So Diggs tonight, he's caught eight, but for only 55 yards. And a lot of that has to do with the defense, just trying to keep it top on things. I was talking with Joe Brady, the quarterback coach who works very hard with Josh Allen every day and every week, and talking about a lot of teams they face and a lot of teams in the NFL. Let's face it, that's become the new way of defending NFL offenses, force them to be patient and have to sustain drives and drive down the length of the field. Buffalo's no different than what they face. Second and nine. Trying to get it over to Davis. Dean covering on the play. May have been tipped. Yeah, I think Golston got his hand on it. He is. He's right in the middle. Does a good job. He's a veteran guy that's been around. He's 6'6". Yep. Going up against the rookie, Torrance. Got just enough. Third down, nine. That's fired. That's caught, but short of the first down. The tight end Kincaid. Ryan Neal stops him. A couple of yards shy. Fourth and two. Josh Ellison, let's go this time. It's almost exactly where they were in their last possession. They tried to draw him off and then eventually punted it. Yeah. See if they decide to go for it this time. Sam Martin saying, give me another chance. I'll put it inside the two. Fourth and two. Do they go for it or just try to draw them offside? Play clock at eight. Same old, same old. Hey, with the puck getting left, the crack. Keep bringing that punter out with a 14-point lead. I'm the crowd. I'm getting more than that here. I know. I know. Well, they may have other ideas, like how many points are we? Well, you know. They're sitting good. You know where we're going. So fourth down. Can he do it again? Can he put it inside the five again? To put a little, you know, backspin on it. He's done it. A little English. The last two points went out of the three and the four. Feared really good. He put it inside the two. Let's see what he's got. Alan chicken out the video. And now we're ready for action again. All right. This time it's a fair catch. And a ball coming out, but it's recovered again by Tompkins. What's wrong with him? He only got it to the eighth this time. If he would have let it bounce, I'm sure it would have been inside the five again. A little over ten to play. Tampa down by 14. Just tonight, pressuring, getting after Baker Mayfield. A lot of times taking advantage of an outstanding field position. pinning Tampa Bay inside their five-yard line three different times and then dial up the pressure, giving them a lot of different looks. Coyer almost coming up with a pick six the last time Tampa was down here. And keep in mind, Mike Evans, 150 games in his career, held under 10 yards only five times. Right now he's at one reception for seven yards. Right. And, boy, would they need him in this situation. Meanwhile, you had a whistle, I think, prior to. Yes, you did. False start. Prior to the ball being snapped, false start. On the offensive to 69, half the distance to the goal. 67, correction. First down. That's Luke Gedeke, and that's the hat trick for him tonight. Three-fault starts. Punt, punt, punt. Out, out, out. Another drive starting inside the 10-yard line. First and 14. Mayfield throws incomplete. Coverage is good. Palmer, the intended receiver. Benford covering on the play, second and 14. Again, Baker Mayfield seems like a lot of his throws tonight, standing in his own end zone. He puts that where the rookie, Palmer, has a pretty good chance. He'd love to see him come down with that. He would have been inbounds with that knee touching, but just not able to hold on. You know, Benford's been pretty good tonight. I mentioned his name. Yeah. So he's been doing the job wherever he's been covering. He's the guy who's starting because Tredavious White has gone for the season. Second and 14. Dancing around. That's caught. And taking it beyond the first down marker to the 25 goes Rashad White. I almost feel like this has become part of their run game. You know, like they don't run the ball that well. So, you know, he'll look to the outside if it's covered. Quickly checks it down. And, again, it's all about giving White just a little bit of room to be able to make people miss. And if you can't get it in the run in the inside zone, check it down to him and let him make a linebacker miss. Yeah, White's already 4-5 tonight for 56 yards. First down. Look at it bounce back. A little bit of a surprise last week for them. Not that they lost, but that one got out of hand. Baltimore looks like they're back to being here comes Lamar Jackson healthy new offensive coordinator and lighten up scoreboards. Number 76 of the offense reported as eligible. 76. Week to week you never know what's going to happen. Never know. That's why people love it. Second and five. On the ground. To the 50. They can chew up all the clock down to about 1.15 or so. You look at the Bills, if they're able to, it looks like they'll be able to hold on tonight. They go to Cincinnati, as you mentioned, their next game. Denver at home, the Jets at home. Then they have a really difficult stretch at Philly, at Kansas City. They have Dallas. So still some big, big games and challenging games for this team. But they looked a lot better tonight. It looks more like the Buffalo team that we saw early in the year than the team that had been struggling in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the Bucs are road warriors. This is the first of four of five on the road. And they won home game over that five-game span. That's Murray coming up a little bit short. But that's going to take us all the way inside. 35 seconds. You get a fourth down here. You figure the way their punter has been pinning Tampa back, and the fact that Tampa is out of these timeouts, work the clock down here. They're going to try to draw them off again. Well, they'll probably take a timeout of it. I think there's nothing else. Take a timeout, and then let Martin handle it. And that's what they're going to do. So it's game day, Utah and Oregon. And then right after game day, I'll be off to Pasadena. Right. With Coach Prime and Colorado against Chip Kelly and UCLA. And I'll fly home after the game on Saturday. So if you want to swing by the Rose Bowl on your Saturdays, come on by. I might do that. Yeah, you should. We need a police escort with the traffic in L.A. No doubt. So here's Martin to try to seal the deal. And will he do it again? Well, the beanbag comes down in the end zone. Just couldn't. He's about as consistent a punter as I think I've seen in a long time when it comes to these pooch punts and pinning them with a perfect bounce on that first bounce inside the five-yard line. That ball should have been down at the one-yard line. He's put them at, what, the four and the three, and that would have been down around the two or one-yard line. So 21 seconds. Still got Mike Evans, right? Right. Well, we saw Mayfield do something off the charts in L.A. on that Thursday night last December against Vegas. Who knows? Who knows? Down the sideline, that picks up a few yards, but also chews up a few seconds as well. Otten makes the catch second down. Trying to at least get in the position to be able to throw one into the end zone on a Hail Mary. The only chance they have is to get the ball out of bounds or throw it downfield and pick up maybe a pass interference call. Evans that time had Dane Jackson bumping him up tight and then Micah Hyde over top of him and he'll do that again and he's 20 yards deep right now downfield Mayfield the whistle had sounded yeah Buffalo called a timeout that's why Baker stopped playing The ball being snapped. Third and final timeout for Buffalo. All right. We'll put that time back on the clock. One six. Thank you. 16 seconds back on the clock. So what's coming up for these teams right down the road here? three of the next four on the road for Tampa Bay and then talked about Buffalo at Cincinnati Denver and the Jets come in here
