 You see Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan, Seahawks with a one-game lead over the Rams. Cardinals have lost three straight, and the Niners come in 6-7. So Kaylee in some rain gear tonight because it's off and on. The shower is coming and going. Figures to be that way for a few hours. Rams won the toss, they defer, and the 49ers will start from the 30-yard line. So Brock Birdie coming out. Missed a game a couple of weeks ago with a sore shoulder in Green Bay. They went on the road. Green Bay and Buffalo back-to-back and got slaughtered in those two games. Came back with that win against Chicago last Sunday. 15 TDs, eight interceptions to the man who was drafted, as we said, last back in 2022. Took over the starting job late in that season. got him to the Super Bowl last year and this year trying to get him back into the playoffs at worst. So Garendo starts it running back. Out of the gun. On first down for the 30-yard line. Play fake. Pass is incomplete. Debo Samuel has been talking about not getting the ball enough so they go right to him. Very first play, they try to get the ball to their guy, Debo Samuel. tight coverage there by Witherspoon, who is in for Kobe Duran, who's out this week. You know, you look at Brock Purdy. It's been a year because of the injuries around him. Trent Williams at left tackle, Christian McCaffrey, IU, all these guys out, and it's impacted him as much as anybody. But he is coming off probably his best game of the year last week. Samuel was in motion. Here goes Garendo around the left side going nowhere. taken down at about the line of scrimmage by Christian Roseboom. So it'll be third down and nine on the opening drive of the game for the 49ers. You know, this Rams defense you and I talked about earlier this year, just kind of looking for an identity, moving past the Aaron Donald era. And they've done a heck of a job with Les Snead, their general manager, bringing in a lot of young talent. We'll talk about them tonight. Guys like Brandon Fisk out of Florida State, Jared Burse out of Florida State. Both those rookies have had a big impact. And the leader, Kobe Turner, 91. Having a great year as well. Those two guys both picked one and two as they short up that defensive line. Purdy stepping up. Purdy going deep. Too deep and incomplete. Flag is down. George Kittle was the intended receiver deep down the left sideline. Penalty will be against San Francisco. Penalty's declined. It's fourth down. Clay Martin is a Thursday night regular. It's the third time we've had him. And we understand we get him next week when we have Denver at the Chargers. Well, that is a frustrating way to start a game where, you know, it's going to be a back-and-forth game for Kyle Shanahan, a three and out for his offense, and a great start for Chris Shula, the defensive coordinator, for the Rams get the ball to Stafford right away after the three and out. Pat O'Donnell to send it down toward Xavier Smith. Fairly short kick. Fair catch called for at the 29-yard line. And that's where Matthew Stafford will set up. Shot. Matthew Stafford has really come on like the team itself. And when he got hot, the team got hot. 19 touchdowns, 7 picks, 4 straight games without an interception. Yeah, right now he's playing as well as anybody. You're right. It has a lot to do with the offensive line getting healthy. They're able to run the football downhill now and be physical with a lot of scrimmage. Kyron Williams, 23, is really the key to set this whole offense up. He's the running back. Cooper Cupp goes in motion. He was motioned on almost every play. And about a four-yard gain for Williams. He's been a stud running back. And that's great Greenlaw. And he talked about him. Hasn't played since he tore his Achilles. Trying to run out onto the field in a bizarre incident at the Super Bowl. Just running out onto the field. went down, and he's been out since then. And you can see on the very first play, if you're a Niners fan, that's what this defense has missed, including Fred Warner in the middle who gets a lot of attention. He's got his sidekick back tonight. Hopefully that'll help this defense out. Second and four. Williams starts to stumble. Taken down to the line of scrimmage. You saw the flag coming in. Leonard Floyd played with the Rams a couple of years ago. In on the stop. Clay Martin to make his second call. against the ranch. Holding. Offense number 77. Ten-yard penalty. Replay second down. Now to rejection, the left tackle. You know, you think of Leonard Floyd like a lot of these guys, you think of them as great pass rushers, but you talk to the coaches, especially Nick Sorensen, he said, hey, man, the thing that's blown us away, how physical he is. Take the lead. 3-0. Paid executive. He was a coach with the New York Giants back in the 70s. What a job he did helping to build the great 49er teams of the 80s and the 90s. Pickoff here. Winningham. He'll bring the ball back out to the 35-yard line. So for the Rams, we talked about what it's been like of late after that terrible start. Entering Week 8 Thursday night football against Minnesota. They were 2-4. They beat Vegas the week before. All kinds of trade rumors about Cooper Cup. Puka Nakua had missed five games. What's going on over there? Meanwhile, 5-2 since that Thursday night game. Stafford, 16 TDs, three picks, and a 108 rating since then. So it's all come together. Start this drive after a three-and-out on their first drive from the 34. and there is at the 41-yard line Puka Nakua. He is fabulous to watch. Let's add another one to his book of catches. It seems like every week, and here he is with his first chance, he catches this on top of his helmet. Ward is in there in coverage. Let me just use your helmet as I get slammed to the ground on my back. No problem. Watch him secure the strength that this guy has. The right hand gets that left hand and just holds on for dear life and makes that catch. I think Rodney Harrison was having nightmares. Second and three. No room in the middle. That's Blake Corum. He's their number two back. Rookie out of Michigan picked in the third round. He spells Tyron Williams here in third and four. Bongo, who came back last week against Chicago, he's had to deal with some injuries himself over the last couple years. He had the ACL last year, dealt with a wrist injury, He had an ankle injury. He got down as well. Cooks brings so much life. So you bring him and Greenlaw back to this defense. It's a very different look. Four-man rush. Clean pocket. And lucky it wasn't picked. It was Stafford. You've got Conno who's under right there, right in his chest. Can't hold on. Four down. Yeah, we're just talking about him on that last play, and he's known for his ability to come up and run support. And this time, again, just like we saw the last possession, they're doing a very good job of anticipating these shorter routes and jumping them. He's right there. Ball hits him right off the chest. That's the second time the 49ers have had a ball in their hands. He's got the club there on that right hand. Tough notes to bring that one in. Too easy. Here's Emi's putt. Another good one. fielded at the 10 and brought back to the 19 by Jacob Cowling on a 50 yards 5-8 21 to go in the opening quarter 3-0 San Francisco Matthew Stafford looking over some things and eventually he'll settle in and this Rams offense you would think will get going the 49ers while their defense is playing well and getting Stafford off the field. They've got to see if they can capitalize on these chances. Defense is playing great. Samuel lining up in the backfield. Hybrid player, wide receiver, running back. Here he goes nowhere. Bunched up by the Rams at the line of scrimmage. Roseboom right there, leading tackle for the two-second down. Like I said, coming in at 129 carries since entering the league in 2019. As a running back, I'm not including the Jets' sleeves. I'm talking about lining others. Christian McCaffrey, of course, is out. And so you get a lot of injuries. You turn to a guy who is a physical, tough, good feel for receiver in that backfield. Second and nine. caught Samuel taking that another guy you know we don't talk about is Brandon Iyub the great receiver who was not happy with his contract didn't know if he'd be traded or not actually started the first seven games then got hurt he's done for the season yeah if you go back out at the beginning of camp when he was holding out there was frustration he was even off to a slow start even when he was available because of missing so much time in the summer so you then he comes back and then he gets the injury. You take out Trent Williams, one of the best to ever play at left tackle, McCaffrey, so it's really piled up on the Niners. Third and four. That pass is incomplete. The coverage is there. Kittle looks napper. Can he get around the corner? No. He's punched up at the one-yard line. Got a flag on the play. Fred Warner is there. Flag on the field. And the 49ers clapping, obviously telling you who the penalty is against. Offense number 87. Kenyon Trinity, 3-play second down. That's on Davis Allen. Yeah, the tight end Davis Allen. He's trying to make a block on Yadam, the corner. Both kind of, there's the grab right there. Stafford, how about the call, by the way? Last guy in the world you think is going to carry it down there is Stafford. Well, yeah, I mean, he has, in the last eight years, he has one rushing touchdown. Yeah, for his own read. There you go. Look at that. 152 meetings, first time. All the way back to 1950. Rams in the NFL at that point, and 49ers coming out of the old America football conference. Second down and 11. It was a huge play. Without that hold, the ball is down to the one-yard line. Three receivers off to the left. Stafford throws on the run. Makua makes the dash at the five-yard line. Again, we saw Stafford use his legs last week. It's some critical moments against the Bills, throwing the ball well on the run. And here, we're at that moment. You know, Sean McVay saying the critical areas will be the difference. How we do on third down. How we do in the red zone. Are we going to be able to score? These are those moments. Talking about his team being resilient. There's so much at stake. They've got to capitalize here. Stafford. Under pressure. Avoids the sack. On the move. Flag is down. Throws tipped. Incomplete. So that was a third and four. And Havenstein. Against the Rams. Against the Rams. Great tackle against Bosa. As good as Havenstein is. That is, when Bosa's healthy and rushing a quarterback the way he is tonight, that is a tough ask. See that right arm get up around the neck right there. There are two fouls on the play, both by the offense. Both fouls will be declined. And that's a man downfield, number 65, holding number 79. Again, they're both declined. It's fourth down. Yeah, Kyle didn't want to give them another shot. He'd rather take his chance and worry about a 6-6 tie and breaking a tie here instead of giving up the TD. McCarty comes in. Had one earlier from 48. This one's from 23. Ethan Evans to put it down. Pair of sixes. Sabra took a shot during that long drive 17 plays for 65 yards there's that shot had the ball 945 here the line drive kick and it just does go into the end zone otherwise it would have come out to the 40 to the 30 they go San Francisco Walker let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS Kobe Turner, number 91 for this Rams defensive line. This season, 20 pressures, most in the NFL while double teamed. And tonight he's been double teamed, especially in that first half. Four pass rushes, four pressures, and a couple sacks. It's not bad. And that's the most in the entire NFL in the first half this season. He will have to have a big impact for this Rams defense to continue to try to harass Brock Purdy when he's back there throwing the football. There's a little frustration on Stafford's part. Turner, second year. Guy out of Wick Forest. Caught here by Samuel. Gain of five and a penalty. First down, Los Angeles. And you know, Al, to me, when it's third down like that, it's a great job, in my opinion, at not sliding. Stafford at 36 years old, great awareness, running away from Bosa. Sometimes you slide, they bring it all the way back because it's where that knee touches. Here he goes forward and is able to get that first down. Of course, the flip side is sometimes you go ahead first and you're back in the tent. That's true. But protected himself there. Ball to 26. quick throw here and the Kula and Puka fights his leg gets a lot of yards after contact as normal for normal Bosa makes a stop there Bosa had some awareness expecting that ball to potentially be coming out he kind of looks at it fly over his head and instead of giving up on it this is what you love to see from Nick Bosa superstar he sees it and instead of giving up on it he goes full speed and chases it down this is more what the Rams expected Remember, they started this drive after a really rough night on their own two-yard line, picking up a few first downs here. Second and two. And getting those two is Kyron Williams. So the Rams now have three first downs on this drive, starting at their own two-yard line. This is the rhythm that they talk about. McVay reminding us this week about why Stafford and these receivers, they're healthy, get a lot of attention. He said, make no mistake, with our line healthy, this entire operation starts with our ability to run the ball. And even when we talked on the other side to Kyle Shanahan, he said, man, if we can't stop them from running, it's going to be a long night for our defense. So that's the battle up front at the line of scrimmage. Stafford. Eyes downfield. Incomplete McCool and the intended receiver. Thrown well out of bounds. It'll be second and ten. Niners doing a great job with just their front. Able to apply that pressure. They got to Stafford. Here's Puka. Take a look at him on his route. Getting behind Robinson. Trying to just use him as a shield. But they've got him locked down. Look at these. You got three, four different 49ers. around number 17. That's one way to stop him. And there's the pressure again on Stafford. Quarters coverage. Second and ten. Draw. Runs into his own man. Ran into Hunter long. It'll be third down and five. Williams already nine carries now. 28 yards. Not only is it raining now, it's gotten a lot chillier. Temperature about 50 and dropping. Remember, the Rams did not give up a sack last week against that talented Bills defensive front. See how they do here on this third down on the edges. Bosa trying to get to him. And he has to backhand it. Backhand flip. Pressure coming from behind him. You had Gross Matos, who was the defensive player of the week in the NFC, putting the heat on as well. Fourth down. And that's what Gross Matos brings. He's not just a defensive end. They can move him inside like this. He keeps Leonard Floyd on the field and Bosa on the field. He brings that kind of versatility and chases Stafford out of the pocket. Almost comes up with a sack after the three that he had a week ago. Evans. Bounces and will roll to a stop at about the 10th. Second week in a row, the 49ers have forced a punt on the first five drives of an opponent. Chicago last week. Rams tonight. 3-0. Rounder. I mean, how many guys do you get in the sixth round? Tom Brady, maybe? Right. Right. There have been a few. Not going to happen. On first down, it's dropped. Jawan Jennings, normally pretty sure-handed. Young covering on the play second down at 10. Yeah, these conditions are obviously impacting the receivers and the passing game. Both coaches trying to make adjustments to the plan that they had coming in and trying to make some tweaks. I mean, this is real. These conditions are not letting up. Steady rain. And a lot of contact, a lot of action, but there is no flag. Cam Curl is there with George Kittle. Good battle. Incomplete. Yeah, they flexed him out. You saw the motion by Devo Samuel, so that creates the one-on-one opportunity, which is exactly what the Niners want. We saw Curl earlier go one-on-one with a shorter route. Now he's downfield, really never finds the football. I think there's contact there. Very easily could have been a call, and the main reason is to contact him without getting the head turned around. Get the flag in the pocket. And it's third down and nine. Purdy, under pressure, fires into traffic. And Jennings, the intended receiver, Jennings, can't hold on. 4,000. Kobe Turner here. He doesn't get, you know, a sack. But it just gives you an idea how powerful this guy is. He always keeps, people keep referring to him as maybe, no one's ever going to be the next Aaron Donald. but he's the guy that's kind of moved into that position. He's got quickness, and that time shows some power on that rush. O'Donnell's punt. He pulled for a fair catch, and then let it bounce. Try to fool the 49ers, but no, sir. Down at the two-yard line by Tongass. 13.5 to go in the first half with 49ers on top of 3-0. How many times do you watch a game a weekend where the gunner never finds the football? What a very disciplined job of coming downfield. Well schooled. Just looking for the ball. Finds the ball. And then just is aware of where that goal line is. And keeps his feet. And the ball outside of the goal line. Great job. So the Rams now. 13 plays for 23 yards. For a team that scored 44 points four days ago. The hole closes quickly. For Kyron Williams, second down. He's got 44 points. They couldn't stop him, Buffalo, last week. And tonight, he got a first down. That's so true. One week to the next in the NFL. Sean McVay, not just last week, really the last three or four weeks, they've been building momentum. It's great to see Fred Warner back out there flying around again after going off the field. Yeah, just missed one play. Second and eight. Keep it on the ground. Nice move, and there is your initial first down for the Rams tonight. Byron Williams spinning his way to a first down at the 15-yard line. Bo Limmer, the center, does a really good job here at getting up to the second level. How about the two receivers? Hooking the Cua 17 You got Cooper Cup Helping out as well Both guys are willing That's the one thing about this Rams offense The receivers get up there and they block They're not just blocking corners They get in there and block linebackers and safeties But good tough running that time by Tyron Williams Toss Williams Right there Kufunga Takes him down we're lost. Again, if you're a Niners fan, you're thinking, man, why couldn't we have been healthy all year? Green-Law's back. Hufunga comes back last week and is such a difference maker with his ability to recognize and right away is anticipating they're going to go to that crack toss. He's able to get out there, get off that block. I think he's a great defender at playing with instincts. Not just against the run, but He's able to play with discipline off the play action and get in position on the back end as well. Second down, 12. Stafford is 2 of 8. Hands the ball up here to the 15-yard line. Brett Warner takes him down. The third down. Remember, this is an offensive line that's finally gotten healthy. They've had some injuries the last few weeks. They've been able to get the pieces together. They've played a lot of football together. and they are finding it to be very, very tough against this San Francisco defense here on a Thursday night. Seven different offensive line combinations for the Rams. Stafford is 2 of 8 for 11 yards after a monster game on Sunday. Deep drop, escaping, going to run and going to pick up that first down. and Warner tried to take the ball away after the play was whistled. Frick comes away with it, but to no avail. For a flag, there is none. Cam Curl defending on the play and it's fourth down. What a matchup here. What a tough ask of Cam Curl who came over from Washington this year, bringing some stability on the back end. O'Donnell is on the punt. This is a 10-day game. So in a game that's only eight minutes old between two pretty high-scoring teams, this is already the fourth punt of the night. O'Donnell's first punt was 40 yards. Replacing Mitch Wisnowski, who was injured in week 11. Short kick. Going to let it bounce. takes a good San Francisco bounce turning into a great San Francisco bounce and down back at the 19-yard line. Not too pretty, but it winds up very pretty on the stat sheet. 55 yards. Sean McVay got the job at the age of 30 and then on the Washington staff, Kyle Shanahan had been the Atlanta offensive coordinator getting their jobs in 2017. Long-time buddies, long-time colleagues before that. Tyron Williams is the running back. Play action. Good protection. And then finally he has to check it down. Williams makes that grab, but he is smothered by Greenlaw. Talking with Shanahan yesterday, he was talking about Greenlaw. He's really the guy for this defense. Yeah, that was impressive to hear him say that. I mean, again, I think Fred Warner, clearly one of the top linebackers in the league, but he would tell you that within this scheme, having Greenlaw out there, the energy that he brings, the toughness that he brings, I think it helps Fred Warner out. So I think nobody's happier to see number 57 out there than Fred Warner there in the middle. Nikula going one way, and then the other. Williams gets tripped up by Greenlaw again by the shoelaces that time. Third down. It's been interesting these first few throws, especially on third down. The safeties from the 49ers, they're in the mind of Matthew Stafford. And it can be interesting to see the adjustments made by Sean McVay. Because remember, Brandon Staley, who is on the other side, who helped out right now, is helping out as an assistant head coach and helping on the defensive side. He coached with McVay and the Rams back in 2020 as a defensive coordinator. Just wonder how much he's helped him with his scheme. Because those safeties are dialed in right now on this prep. Good point third down three to go Stafford hanging in the pocket throwing too high Incomplete to the Rams with Ward covering on that last place Still without a first down almost ten minutes into the quarters They doing a great job at disrupting the timing with Stafford in these receivers And it been very very evident They mixing up coverages mixing up looks That big tight coverage there with Ward going up against Cooper Cup Really tight coverage. At the beginning of that route, Stafford looked left, had to come all the way back, and by then it was too late getting that ball to Cooper Cup. Evans already his third punt of the game. This one is secured at the 18-yard line and brought back to the 22 by Jacob Cowick. At the top, though, you've got some prime-time guys. They've been missing most of the season, or at least parts of the season. From the 22-yard line, Ferdy, good protection, goes to the outside, holds in. Jennings really coming on, 12-yard gain. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, with all these injuries to the 49ers, As George Kittle told me, that means they've lost some experienced players who understand the sense of urgency required when your back's against the wall like theirs is now. Not everyone on this team has felt that desperation before, and Kittle didn't feel like it really clicked for the young guys until last Sunday. That's when he finally saw them scratching, clawing, fighting every single snap. Grit, as he said. We're missing the grit. Pass over the middle. Correndo makes the catch. And again tonight, they get some guys back, but Trent Williams is still out in this first straight game with a left tackle. I like that he said we have grit individually, but we need to see it as a team. There's Trent Williams who's a big part of the grit of that offensive line, and they really miss him up front, not only because of his talent, just because of his presence and what his presence means to that offensive line and kind of the personality of the offensive line. Jalen Moore will play that role until Williams comes back. Dorindo is able to fight his way and angle his way. I pass to 45 for his first down for San Francisco. Telling us it's going to stop in a half hour. Who knows? Second and ten. On the ground. Tough two yards for Isaac Dorindo. He's now carried seven times, but for only 18 yards. Good job setting the edge. And Debo Samuel, we were just bragging about the Rams receivers. Debo Samuel comes off the edge and just kind of whiffs there and trying to make a block on Cam Pearl. Both these teams rely on the perimeter blocking when it comes to running football. third down he's used to comes into the backfield send him over the middle 30 throws up at the 22 yard line Kittle pulls it in to convert to a first down covered by Witherspoon Jake Brindell does a heck of a job here watch the center first of all look at the overload here the potential threat and he just senses that possibility and comes over late to help out. That's really good recognition there in pass pro on a third down. And when in doubt, wet conditions, put it up to number 85 in one-on-one coverage, and Kittle will come down with it. Rams almost jump offside. It was Jared Burse who got back. And that time it is Byron Young who takes Garendo down in the backfield. So Garendo now, eight carries, 16 yards. Great shot. It was all across the board. Bobby Brown, 95 wins. Omar Spates, the linebacker comes inside. The only place he can go is try to bounce it. And when he bounces it, look at Young get off that block. Young is, you know, verse gets most of the attention, the rookie. But the second-year man out of Tennessee is relentless. Plays really good with awareness with his eyes in that backfield. Second and 11. down the sideline. He got free, but the pass is too long for Jawan Jennings. Third and 11. Weather, no doubt, playing a big fan. Trying to find their men, dropping a couple of passes here and there. Third and 11. Chris Shula, the defense coordinator from the Rams, not afraid to leave his guys on islands. that's part of what you have to do against this San Francisco defense. You've got to take some chances, and to do that, your corners and linebacker safety's got to hold up. Purdy escapes. Not for far, not for long. Kobe Turner is there. And he got three there. He might have picked up a first down. He had enough space, but Turner is there to get it from behind. Forced a punt. There he is. We keep talking about him and what he faces, is not just for the mass singer, but just the guy who can play football. He's a guy that walked on at Richmond, and then he goes to Wake Forest, and a guy that they really thought could become a great player and has become kind of a leader of that front. Good job of playing with a high motor there and not give up on it. Here comes O'Donnell's fifth punt of the night. Line drive spinner, 36-yard line. Xavier Smith's leg is down. Back at the 14-yard line near the line of scrimmage. Relatively penalty-free game. Only one accepted for each team. Clay Martin will tell us about this one. Rams 49ers. Thought we'd have a shootout. It's turned out to be a punt-a-thon. Go figure. Who knew? Illegal formation on San Francisco. They had five players in the backfield. The Rams will enforce the five-yard penalty at the end of the play. First down. Timeout. Stafford's got great field position. See what they do with it. Headfield. 4-52. From the 50-yard line, the Rams begin this drive. Down 3-0. And start on the ground. You need the team doing anything on the ground tonight. that's Tyron Williams taken down there. The 49ers defense knew against Sean McVay. We talked about how it starts with their ability to run. They knew. Look at this. They've had, what, one, two, three, four, five possessions. Finally put something together in the last drive when they started their own three. But they came in knowing they had to stop the run. And the first intent for those linebackers are flying downhill, both Greenlaw and Warner. against the run. Great practice player, big time prep guy. And going up against his former team who he won a Super Bowl with, you know he's ready to go. So second and 14 after the penalty. Rushes on. Gets it away, and it's incomplete. Cooper Cupp is well covered on the play by the Amador Lenore. Third down and 14 for the Rams. Pretty good job of picking up any kind of movement to give Stafford enough time. As you said, Al, there's always going to be three-snap movement, trying to get a tip on the coverage. Look at Stafford work from the left back to the right. Lenore, very, very tight coverage, anticipating that ball coming to the backside there to Cuff. Good coverage. John McVay in his eighth season as the head coach, and also the play caller. Here's Bosa. Trying to draw a bead on Stafford on the third and 14. Locking's good. Pass is incomplete. Again intended for a cup. Lenore again covering on the play. So fourth down. Lenore, another great play. And just kind of feeling these in-breaking routes. He's sitting back with a pass rush that they have. He's able to just kind of sit back and read the eyes of Stafford. He knows he has a receiver outside. so there's a threat of the potential pass to the inside. He just read the eyes, took him to the ball, undercuts it, almost comes up with a pick. Ethan Evans, the 6'3", 250-pound punter, sends it down to the 19-yard line. Jacob Cowling brings it back to the 27. So the game begins with each team. Three it out in Santa Clara on this Thursday night. 11 catches, 286. Two TDs of 90 plus. How good of a player, John Taylor. I mean, Jerry Rice, obviously. But boy, John Taylor's so many big plays on that route, that quick slam. Birdie, wide open. Kittle, middle of the field, to the 41-yard line. Quinton Lake, able to run him down. Kittle, in his eighth year, as productive as ever, 33 yards. Yeah, this is what hurt the Rams' defense early in the year was just miscues. This time the free safety, Quentin Lake, just late 37 right there, just kind of gets his eyes in the wrong spot. It frees up a big opening over the middle, and that is stealing for Brock Purdy going to his main guy for a huge gain there to George Kittle. First first down of the game from the 41. And running into Samuel that time was Garendo. So Samuel doesn't get the ball enough, and then he winds up sending his own man to the ground. Put him in the books as a tackle there. That just missed time there with emotion. Both these teams do so much pre-snap movement. That time just not timed up well. Nick Garenda was probably the most surprised as anybody. Garenda a foot sprain in Sunday's game. Didn't know he would play or not until last night when Shanahan said, yep, he's ready to go. Greenlaw along with Bosa. Second and nine. Through the right side this time. Picks up about three. Guy who started his college career in Wisconsin wound up at Louisville. Fourth round pick. Yeah, and, you know, it's amazing. You start in high school as a receiver. You get a little bit of weight. Of course, you go to Wisconsin. They flip you as a running back. Eventually, as you mentioned, goes to Louisville. Good downhill runner. It's always amazing. Mike Shanahan, Kyle Shanahan, they find backs. Think about what they've lost. Not just McCaffrey, but Jordan Mason, Elijah Mitchell, if you go all the way back. So as Kaylee said, the fourth back for the season. Here's Samuel. And Samuel taking that after a gain of one. Michael return it. So Samuel wants the ball more. he's liable to get the ball a lot more as a running back I think that's a great way to get in touch especially with all the injuries that they have in that backfield he's done that throughout his career not just in jet motion I think he has 129 career carries as a running back so he'll do that tonight a 53 yard field goal attempt here for Jake Moody kind of had a spotty season Pat O'Donnell to put it down and from 53 out that kick is just inside the left up right five minutes into the game the 49ers not only a great runner very similar running style is Williams but also can catch the ball to the backfield nice block by Puka on Fred Warner to get him spring him free and pick up those yards after the catch 12-yard gain, longest play of the night for the Los Angeles offense. Stafford to the outside, and that's going to be taken for about an 8-yard gain by Hunter Long. Tight end, a man who returned a block punt for a touchdown last Sunday. With these linebackers and corners dropping and sinking in coverage, Safeties are physically turning their body and waiting for in-breaking routes. The answer by Sean McVay is to get the ball out to the flat there, whether it's a back or tight end. Just get the ball out there quickly. And pick up the pace. Going no huddle here. Second and two. Yep, Corum. And he bites his way for a first down. That's Lenore. Lenore making that tackle. as the clock ticks down to seven minutes, and the Rams are in trying to pick up the pace here. Yeah, and again, there's a look at last couple weeks. What a difference. That's part of it. I loved what he said to Cade. What he said is it's just one of those games. When you say it's just one of those games, that means you've got to find a way to win a divisional matchup. As sloppy and as ugly as it might be, you've just got to find a way. Remember, they're playing for a chance to win the last four and win this division. The ugly wins count just as much as gorgeous. wins. Stafford firing into traffic. Tipped and incomplete. Trying to get it to Colby Parkinson. First time he's been targeted tonight. Ward and Hufunga bracketed him on the play. It's second and ten. We talked about how you're taking these shots in the flat. Now Brown says with that motion, oh they're going to throw it out in the flat. We've got to take that away. Timed up pretty well, but look at all the defensive backs ready for that shot downfield down that sideline. Ward is there. Hufunga is there. So they took all options away from Stafford on that route. They know that Rams playbook pretty well. They're dialed in. Second down and 10. Corum. Short game. So it'll be third down and seven now for the Rams. 6.20 to go in the third. The thing that's been most impressive to me is how this 49ers defensive line, it's usually, when you think of the Niners defensive line, you think of the ability to rush the quarterback. But Bosa being back has given them some toughness on the edge. Leonard Floyd on the other side doing a great job in the interior, holding up against his physical Rams offensive line and run down. Williams is back in, but he's the receiver in this set. Nakua comes in motion. Stafford sliding left, throwing. Nakua reaches up, pulls it in a little bit short of the first. Hit by Jaya Brown. It'll be fourth and one. What a job here by Stafford and Nakua, who goes into motion and then gets matched up against Lenore and gets able to separate, but he knows he's in traffic. I mean, that's a big hit there by the safety ground. But, again, he shows that toughness and the strength to hold on to it. Snatched it out of the air. Williams is the running back. Fourth and one. Keeper. And a first down. So Stafford takes it himself. And moves the ball to the 35-yard line first down. We were talking to him this week and saying, Dude, you look like the best you've looked in your career as far as your body. There's Bosa limping off the field. He goes over that right leg of 50. Lemmer, the center, plenty of room there to pick up the first down. He talked about how kind of like Max Crosby, it's something he lives year-round, takes care of his body like so many guys that are in their 30s. Diet, exercise, the guy comes out, works on his body to keep him feeling good as often as he can. He's taken every snap this season in his 16th year in the league. Fighting his way for a five-yard lean, Kyron Williams, who was nominated. He's the Rams nominee for man of the year. Yeah, outstanding young man. Watched him grow up, called one of his first few games. He was in South Bend at Notre Dame. And what's great about Blake Korn later in the year, getting more and more carries and getting better and better acquainted with his Rams offense, is he's getting more opportunities. And it takes some of the heat off. Young makes the stop. That's where you find out how that foot is doing when you have to run through some tackles. He ran right through Kobe Turner. He gets to that second, let's see, 91 chasing him. He eventually bounces right off of him. And that extra effort, that spin, gets him that first down. So far, that foot holding up very nicely for him. Four carries for him, 11 yards. three and a half left in the quarter San Francisco leading 3-0 Kittle is the motion man and again they give it to Gurendo talking about the guys they're missing of course McCaffrey's number one Jordan Mason has done a nice job Elijah Mitchell would have been number three you're going all the way down the list here to Gurendo yeah and if Gurendo's foot doesn't hold up you know you're talking about Patrick Taylor out of Memphis would be number five and of course Tebow Samuel would be able to help out as well I mean, it's been that kind of year. Here's Taylor. Saw a little bit of action last week. Not much before that. Second down and six. Ball right on the 50. Play fake. Knocked down. Good play there by Witherspoon. Coming in there because Kobe Durant is hurt. He breaks up that play in his third and six. Second time they've tried him on that quick slam. And both times he's done a really good job of positioning himself to be able to knock the ball away. Remember, he is a veteran. Really has a feel. You can see that Jennings tried to sell him like he was going downfield. He's going to go buy him on a go-route and then put the brakes on, but not fooled at all. Really good job of defending that. Yeah, former 49ers, seventh year in the league. Is Witherspoon, third down and six now. Juszczyk is in the backfield. Go, go, go! Purdy, under pressure, look out They get him To the 46-yard line Colby Turner, number 91 He of the recent Masked Singer fame Catch the shot Well, they show pressure And then they end up only bringing four You see him walked up And then Young drops But there is a nice stunt there I think it caused enough confusion there that eventually purdied just nobody downfield, and they collapsed that pocket right on him. O'Donnell, his third punt, sixth punt of the quarter. Bearcats goal for it. Made at the 16-yard line by Xavier Smith. Exactly two minutes to play in the period. Niners on top three. A lot of athletes. across all sports. Absolutely. Congratulations to Dr. Edwards. Sprinkles now. We've got a little showers off and on. And the Rams start this drive. Looking for a first down for the first time tonight. Corham gain of a three. Speaking of first time, it's great to see Trey Greenlaw back playing football. Of course, he had the injury that Al talked about, just jogging out in the field in the Super Bowl. Tears the Achilles. Worked very, very hard. We saw him on the field before the game. He looked like he was getting ready to play in another Super Bowl. He's worked so hard for this moment. He's been on the field now all 11 snaps for this 49ers defense and is flying around. Yeah, no pitch count for him, at least to this point in the game. But for the moment now, Fred Warner playing with a broken bone in his ankle since early in the season was flexing the leg, but he's going to walk out and has to be out for at least one play. Yeah, he plays so hard. I think at the end of this play, he kind of gets near making the play and it goes right there. Just kind of the way he landed. It's just awkward. The way he came down. Nobody plays harder than Fred Warner. Second and seven. Stafford. Play action. Has to check it down. He's lucky that one wasn't picked. Blake Corum, the intended receiver. Who else is over there? Greenlaw. Third and seven. Greenland's all over the place. He really is. You know, in these conditions, ball's a little bit slick. Blake Horum watching him in college for a number of years at Michigan. The rookie can catch the football. Very similar back style-wise to Kyron Williams. This goes right off his hands, and we've got another third down. We've not seen either team convert a third down yet tonight. Rams don't have a first down. Warner is back in, third and seven. Atwell, the man in motion. Going that way, and too high intended for the Marcus Robinson. Ward covering on the play. So the Rams, without a first down, and we are sorry. The Rams have been as far as the 50-yard line tonight. Second and eight. and again Williams look at him go look at him go wow yards you have to contact he would not stop it looked like a two yard gain he just wouldn't stop the offensive lineman got behind him they kept pushing Jackson gets in there the left tackle look at his leg drive talk about determination and the linemen feed off of Kyron Williams. The whole team does. Got five on the tush-push. Third and one. Top in motion. Williams has enough. 322. Looking back to the half, Kaylee. Guys, as this rain keeps coming down harder and harder, the Rams sideline is making some preparations if needed. You've got one staffer filling an equipment case over here with extra pairs of cleats in case a player should ask for bigger spikes if they need more traction. Underneath one of these tarps, there's a whole stack of new dry gloves should somebody call for them, and they're bringing out the mats if guys need to clean off those cleats as they start to get muddy. And you will have a wardrobe change at the half, I assume? I wish. From the 38-yard line, here's Williams. He had 29 carries last week. He has 13 tonight. 42 is an offense. They know that they've got to, again, establish that. What I think it sets up, now the weather conditions make it tough, but it definitely allows you to set up the play action on early downs and take some shots with the way these safeties and backers are getting downhill against the run. Second and seven. Will they run a play before the two-minute warning? They do. And it's Nick Poster right there. To stop Williams. And that takes us to the two-minute warning with 156. Remaining in the half. Three-nothing 49ers. 43. Third down and six. He's 43 playing 33. Quick flip out here to Nakua. And Warner is right there to stuff him. So now it's fourth down. So the field goal kicker is Josh Carty. He comes in here. You're talking about a roughly a 48-yard field goal. But they're going to, at the moment, keep the offense out there. At the end of the Buffalo game last week, they made a monster fourth and five on a pass to Tutu Atwell. Here they line up to go for it on fourth and two. Play clock at five. And just trying to draw them offside. So they'll bring Carney in here to try a field goal. Came in here, you got one team scoring 44 last week. The other team routing Chicago. Touchdowns galore. 3-0. The weather obviously has a lot of weather, even though it's abating right now. You're right on cue here with the rain. You had it down. You said it was going to stop at about 30 minutes. It stopped. Then again, they said 40% chance of rain, and it's been pouring the entire first half. But hopefully they'll dry out a little bit. We'll get some more offense going in the second half. They don't call me Dr. Doppler for nothing. You're all over it. 48-yard attempt. Cardi, a rookie out of Stanford. That is college ball right up the road. This is the time of the game. And Cardi's kick is right down to 1-0-1. 65 seconds to halftime. 3-3 on Thursday Night Football. So the field goal was good, but look at this. Big left hand of Jordan Elliott, a 6-4, and it still went right down the middle. Yeah, just off the top of that fingertip. but he really drove that ball. Good snap, good hold, and look at that. And we'll continue to try to find a way to do that. Second and ten. Fires, caught. That's been a nine-yard game here for Kittle. Taken down by Hoyt. Third and one upcoming. This offense, like so many, based on the timing and the rhythm in the pass game, and here he just gets back, a hitch, ball out. perfectly thrown. There was no hesitation. Found his man, knew exactly what the answer was based on the coverage. Saw Hoyt, who's really a better pass rusher than he is playing out in coverage. So good job of recognizing that pre-snap and getting the ball out there quickly. Kittle has not caught three. You got Purdy himself. Picks up the first down. I love that because he just didn't hesitate I mean he just saw a gap over the right side of the center he didn try to bait him or try to get him to jump He just saw it and just took off You know he is a very athletic guy You know, you and I standing on the field talking to him with Kaylee before the game. He's thick. You know, his legs and his lower half and his core are very thick, too. Better runner than he gets credit for. Got some great runs in the playoffs last year. Oh, yeah. Garendo made that grab. Yeah, very instinctive of when to pull it down and go. He's not looking to go, but if it's there, he knows how to make it happen with his legs. Another nice catch there by Garendo. Good shot there. Stafford and Cooper Cupp. There'll be no panic in those veterans. They've got to find some answers, and eventually he's got to get the football back and see if they can get this offense going. I thought Sean was right, McVeigh, by crediting San Francisco. instead of what is wrong with the Rams. Niners are playing pretty good defense. Absolutely. Second down and eight. Toss back here. Garendo tries to cut it back and take it down. There's Hoyt again. Spates as well, Omar Spates. Third down, third and ten. Coming to that running game, it also helps to have a great offensive line coach as well. Yeah, yeah, you're right about that. Real quick here on Hoyt. This guy is, we just talked about him back in coverage. That's his game right there. Either rushing the quarterback or setting an edge, fighting off a couple blockers, forces that ball back to the inside, still gets his hands on and helps make the tackle. Great play there by a guy who's become a mentor and leader for this young defense. Now Patrick Taylor comes into the game in the backfield. Blair him out and the pass caught and then drop over the middle. Deebo Samuel would have had the first down and maybe a touchdown had he caught it. Now the crowd, of course, is responding to the fact, give me the ball, and look what happened. Well, you're right. I mean, it's man coverage, well designed, exactly what he wants. He just starts to look ahead of where he wants to run with the football before he secures it. I mean, it's man-to-man. There's a safety in the middle, but Brock Purdy put it in front of him where he could run after the catch, which the Niners are legendary for. And just drops the football. Here's Moody, a 47-yarder, to give the 49ers the lead. And Jake Moody is able to bang that one through. 8.23 remaining in the third. Samuel dropped it. Might have had seven. Instead, they get three. And the 49ers are up 6-3 on Thursday Night Football. A crazy situation in the Super Bowl. Like, what? Even Conor Fanning said, they looked over, he said, what just happened? And it's been that long since he was able to get into a game, and tonight he's back in there, and the Rams will start this drive at the 30-yard. We see these injuries all over the NFL. It's amazing. I think the mental part of that, like you really don't fully test it, That fast twitch until the first time you get out there on the field. And it's just great to see that it's holding up as well as it is here tonight, his first game back. Played very well. Played a lot. Hasn't been on the pitch count tonight. Well, there's Debo Samuel just reliving that drop. Blake Corham is the back here. Williams has already carried 16 times, so Corham's going to get a shot. He has two carries for three. Cup is in motion. Stafford retreats under pressure. Throws. Caught. And this is Corum, the rookie out of Michigan, picking up 12 in the first half of Los Angeles. I'm telling you, this guy has that ability. He dropped the ball earlier when the conditions weren't that great, but he did this throughout his career at Michigan. Our folks going to have our seventh punt of the quarter. this 49ers secondary is really doing a good job of mixing up the looks keeping Stafford and these receivers guessing Stafford who came in playing as well as anybody these last four weeks just looks unsettled and hasn't been able to find his rhythm yet within the offense Evans line drive kick but a lot of distance and it's a beauty as it turns out it's fielded back at the 14-yard line by Cowen and he brings it back out to the 30-yard line on a line. It went for 60 years. A line drive. Four straight drives without a first down. First time this happened to Sean McVay. 49ers have three first downs and three points. And the pass is caught, but only a one-yard game here by Dorindo, taken down by Michael Hoyt. Second and nine. One of the first screens tonight. We'll see quite a few on both sides. Really, the timing of that didn't work out to be able to get the linemen downfield. This Rams defense, like we talked about earlier, I think Sean McVay and Lesnita are very proud of what they've been able to build here with this young nucleus of players, especially up front, with the defensive linemen and outside linebackers. Second and nine. Pass is low to the spot. But it's interesting you bring that up because when the 49ers changed regimes and Shanahan came in with John Lynch, the first thing they did was build that defensive front, get a pass rush. And now the Rams are the team that's really flipped it on the 49ers. Yeah, I think they had to. There was so much concern. What are you going to do without Aaron Donald? They went out and found not just one guy. They found five or six guys to try to help make that a strength across the board. There's John Lynch in the gloaming. as the rain comes down a little bit harder here at the end of the quarter. End of one. San Francisco three. Francisco on top. And we can tell you next week, first ever Thursday night flex game as we go to Los Angeles. Broncos, Chargers, both very much in the playoff hunt. Kansas City on top in that division. But Denver and Los Angeles trying to get to the tournament. Next Thursday night on Prime. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung. We start here with a, from the 36-yard line, a third down and four. And a flag here. Yeah, Debo Samuel moving a little early, so he'll push the Niners back. Offense number one. Five-yard penalty. Third down. Samuel. Third and nine now. He's just anxious to get out of his stance and try to get downfield here. Jumps a little bit early. Talks about touches and opportunities. He has four touches, a couple carries, a couple receptions already tonight. Penalty free game to this point. Each team was won. That pass. Of course, the minute I say it, here comes the flag as Jawan Jennings makes the catch and is out of bounds on the Rams' side of the field. Are they going to get that on the defense for grabbing on? Witherspoon there in coverage against Jennings. 49ers seem to think so as they're moving up toward midfield. Pretty handling the football pretty well. He's got a big hand. Throwing a pretty tight spiral here. Loves the out cut. Loves the timing of that. Jennings is the guy who's really had to step up for this offense. You go back to week three when he went up against the Rams, had a monster game. 11 catches and 175 yards into three touchdowns. I feel like both these offenses and the weather, respect they have for the other side of the defense, just feeling each other out, eventually looking for some bigger shots downfield. Yeah, we're only in like the third round of a 12-round fight. You know, trying to carry, figure it out. Garendo goes nowhere. Second down and long. Look at that. Roseboom who leads the Rams in tackles. The Rams up front, we were bragging about their defensive line. Do a pretty good job of keeping him clean. You'll see him in the run game. It's so important when you defend Kyle Shanahan. He gets downhill. He makes a lot of tackles. Shanahan pacing. Trying to get a better look from a different angle. Fifth yard line, second down and nine. Going deep. Off with Kyron Williams. Maybe eventually it goes to like a 70, 30, 60, 40, where they're both getting their chances. Yeah, instead of 29 carries in the Buffalo game, there's 17 carries tonight. Second and five, and flags for all start. Offense number 79. Five-yard penalty. Second down. It's Rob Havenstein, the last of the St. Louis Rams with them in St. Louis in the 2015 season, the year before they moved to L.A. Bosa went off the field. He's now back on the field here. Also, Drake Greenlaw went off the field a few snaps ago, so we'll keep an eye on him as well. I don't know if he's on a pitch count tonight. He doesn't look like he's in any kind of pain, but he is not on the field currently. He told Kyle, I want to play in the fourth quarter. That's my quarter. Play fake. Pass caught. Natua. Probing. Yards after contact. Does it all. To the 21-yard line goes Puka. He is a tough guy again. Any receiver that's going to come underneath like this, especially on a quick throw, that's no man's land. Safeties. Look at the blockers downfield. A great shot by the right guard. Dotson getting downfield. But that's no man's land. You can take a forearm to the chest very easily from Fred Warner or safety. Nice drive here by the Rams, Al. And McCoolick comes after a play on the sideline. First and 10. 2.40 to go in a quarter. Williams. He can move that pile. To the 18-yard line. he goes it'll be second and six after a game of four. This is their first red zone trip of the year. If you go back and look at the way the Rams season has gone it really comes down to the games that they're winning. They're scoring touchdowns down here in the games that they've lost. Many cases they've had to settle for field goals so in a game like this you just don't know how many the more opportunities you're going to get. Second and six. Williams. To the Rams right now, which is known as the red zone. Obviously inside the 20-yard line. The 49ers, I think, have given up 13 consecutive touchdowns on the opponent's red zone drive. Yeah, it's not been pretty all year for them. But they got them the third down. There it is. Longest streak since the COVID year. Nakua has been the weapon, not just tonight, but since he's been back healthy. So a big third and five. Give it to Williams, and he gets the first down. Kyron Williams to the 11-yard line. What a call. Really good call. Davis Allen, the only tight end in. Sean McVay spreads the defense out with receivers. No tight end in the in line. That was the key block right there. Avala, the left guard, does a nice job there of kicking out Milik Collins. And I think the Niners were very surprised by that call. Sean McVay with a heck of a call there to just kind of spring him loose. Final minute of the period. Williams again. You know, you look at his numbers. They're not that impressive tonight. I mean, 21 carries, 72 yards. But you have to watch the game to realize the value of this guy. I'm right there with you. We talked, you said at halftime, what are they going to do? I said he's going to be stubborn and stick to what he knows as far as the run game. Kyron Williams and work play action off of that. This is the 14th play on this drive right now. Drive is over eight minutes long. Second and three. And they will not get a playoff. Change ends of the field. To the fourth we go. San Francisco, six, Los Angeles, three on Thursday Night Football. Five, tough one for them at home against Green Bay coming up Sunday night. Rams seven and six. Arizona, three losses in a row, 6 and 7. And the 49ers trying to hang in there to get to 500. Meanwhile, this is the 14th play of a drive. Let's consume 823. It's a second and three. From the four. Ball not affected at all by that fingertip. Shouldn't have gotten the manicure. 65 seconds to halftime, and the 49ers will take it at the 30-yard line. Update the playoff picture as we start week number 15. So you've got Detroit clinching a bird. Philly as well. Seattle leads the West. Tampa Bay at 7-6. Vikings, Green Bay, and Washington at the moment would be the wildcard teams. Of course the division winners Or division leaders Will wind up getting a wild card game At home Trent Williams of course they missed him The left tackle there he is missing his Fourth game But ten days off before their next game Might get him back The next game will be A week from Sunday As Debo Samuel here Picks up about six Next game is at Miami Purdy just at about yeah just over a hundred yards here in this first half and it's like Kyle Shanahan with those three timeouts thinking about trying to at the very least get into field goal range here. Second and over the middle pass incomplete trying to get it to Ricky Pearsall first time he's been targeted tonight Quentin Lake on the coverage third down to four with 41 seconds. Rams will get the ball to start the second half Sean, braving the elements. He may be the first coach I've ever seen in rain like this, not that we ever had. Well, Bill Belichick was in the news today. You think? That was a shocker. Third down and four. Purdy firing broken up trying to get it to Jennings busting it up here Blake in on the play fourth and four really good job here of communication with the defensive backs didn't see it but a little switch there with the motion good job back to back plays by Lake really I tell you for a guy that's a safety Sometimes he's a corner. Sometimes he's a nickel. Really does a good job in a different area that time. Had to play downfield and did a good job. Yeah, pretty good bloodlines. His father, Carnell, great safety back in the Pittsburgh days. Xavier Smith makes the fair catch here. 29 seconds. Now, not much. Pretty good. This has been 45 minutes or so as the Rams now have two timeouts, 29 seconds, as they try to work in the field goal range. Start here, Nakua. Nakua works his way up to a 31. Green log in on that tackle. And they let the clock run down here. I think on that last possession, to get this thing tied up as sloppy as this first half has been, kind of regroup, see where things go in the second half for both these coaches. Yeah, dry off, maybe change their shoes. We'll see. It is the end of kind of a bizarre first half in a way. Two teams, high-scoring teams. Off of play action, would be surprised to see him try to take a shot or two here early in this second half to try to stretch that 49er defense out. Yeah, the Rams are going to get the ball. Nakua coming off an unbelievable game. Against Buffalo, one catch, eight yards, cup, no catches. Third quarter is underway. It's a returnable kick from the five-yard line, Jordan Whittingham. Good coverage here, and they take him down to the 24 moments ago. Kaylee with Sean McVay. Well, Sean, you get the ball, and hopefully this weather holds. How do you get your passing game going? Yeah, I mean, the weather has been a little bit of a factor. I mean, the ball's been slick. And they've done a good job. We haven't been able to get much going in the past game. We haven't stayed connected in the run game. But it was a great job by Josh Carty to be able to hit that field goal. Here we are, 3-3. Let's see if we can do something in the second half. You've held the Niners to just a field goal. How do you sustain that? Our defense has done a great job. They're winning on third down. They're being efficient on the early downs. It's really been one of those games. I do think the weather's been a factor. We've got to get some stuff going offensively and sustain possession and come away with points. And they start on the ground here. One correction, McCool with three catches tonight, Cup with none. Meanwhile, Williams has been the workhorse, of course, for Los Angeles on the ground. 15 carries for 47 yards, averaging about three per carry. Yeah, it's amazing. You know, you look at his body. This guy's a workhorse. You know, he counts for 74% of the Rams' carries this year. That's the highest percentage of any back in the NFL. And see, again, if they can get him on track. But I think the combination of him and then taking some shots downfield, I don't just mean go balls, but those deep crossers at about 15 to 20 yards there. Second and seven. Here he is again. With a thousand-yard mark last week for the second year in a row. Third down. And that first half just tuning in, you've got two of the better receivers with Stafford. I mean, these guys come in on fire. You can see that these underneath routes have been taken away. tight coverage. A lot of times it's Stafford looking one way, kind of working through his progressions, and then eventually coming back. But linebackers, great communication with the corners and safeties. Ward has played the best game we've seen him play since he has come back over the last three weeks. So that first half, you chalk it up to the Niners' defense in their preparation. Third and five. Stafford. the secondary continues to do its job and just has to flip it into the bench so they get enough pressure on him he still is out of the pocket let that secondary like blue yeah and that's just rushing for that's what they did in the first half it's it's not a blitz i mean you got some great pass rushers but once he gets out you're playing zone it's just great awareness of looking around. That's plaster. You know, you always see defensive coaches saying, we've got to plaster if the quarterback moves around. There's just nowhere to go for Stafford when he's throwing his football. So Evans is averaging 56 yards a punt. That's another line drive. It's taken back to the 37-yard line by Jacob Towing. So the Rams, quickly done after that first drive. 46-yard punt by Evans. and San Francisco will start this drive from its own 37. And I do think that the Niners are a totally different unit. You know, they've had so many injuries, but Drake Greenlaw coming back to help them out, Ufunga coming back for his second week who has been out for so long. You're talking about major factors in that defense, and I think it's inspired them tonight. So Yusek is the fullback, helping to lead the way for Garenda. Maybe we'll see Juszczyk a little bit more here on the ground game as Garenda picks up eight yards here. Yeah, nice combination block with Brendel and Banks, 64-65. Watch the center and left guard establish that, and they get up to the linebackers. Juszczyk is able to get the nice block. I mean, that's San Francisco 49ers offense right there, no matter who the running back is. Juszczyk now in motion. Sets on the wing to the right. Norendo on the ground, and he gets to the 50-yard line in the first half of the 49ers. I think everybody over the years has marveled at the Shanahan coaches, you know, Mike and Kyle, the backs that they've had. You know, very rarely are they getting, you know, a guy that's the guy, like a Christian McCaffrey who they got through a trade with Carolina. You know, go through the years, all the way back to Terrell Davis at Denver. I mean, it's a guy that fits their system, a guy that has good vision. He's physical. He's tough. Gets into that hole and is able to just fit with what they like to do in this offense. Straight drop. Pass out to Golinda on the outside. And he has a first down. Darius Williams makes the tackle. 49ers on the move. And that's where he's most natural. Just going back to his days of a high school wide receiver before he moved when he went to Wisconsin to running back. He made a great catch last week against the Bears where he adjusted back to the football to kind of give you an idea of what he could do with his hands. So very natural catching the football. And I think he just keeps getting better and better with his feel of hitting these holes and understanding, like we talked earlier in this scheme, of the timing of the zone play. Hey, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy. Run, run, run, Lucy. Back in the shotgun. On a first down, dancing, throwing, and incomplete. Bebo Samuel was the intended receiver, second and ten. I think Brock Purdy wants to get the ball to his guys so badly that sometimes when you want it so bad, sometimes you start to just aim the football. I mean, he is such an accurate quarterback, and this is an easy throw. The ball just kind of sailed on him. I mean, he had to answer questions this week about, hey, did you hear what Debo Samuel tweeted out? Can you believe this? And he had to answer that a couple of times. Like, guys, listen, nobody wants to get in the ball more than me. You know, he waited for Pearsall. It was a long, developing route. And if he is able to connect on that, that gets him down to inside the 35-yard line. And now, you know, you've got a shot. And at this point, six seconds, you're just going to throw it up Hail Mary off to the right here. Extra rush. And they're going to end the game with a sack. So the Rams, instead of sending three, dropping eight, sent five. Roseboom gets credit for the sack. And the Rams have now won seven of their last nine. Great call by Chris Shula. So often, like you said, usually it's three. You drop eight. Everybody's back in the end zone. And instead, they showed three. And then as the ball is snapped, those two linebackers, they dialed up the heat. Two guys who have a long history together. McVay and Shanahan. Watch the linebackers. Here they come. It's actually a safety. Cam Pearl with the linebacker, Roseboom. And they get to him. Great call. and so the Rams it took them four drives almost the entire first quarter to get a first down tonight and not that the offense was any great shakes for either side 3-3 was the halftime score it's a game of field goals Cardi kicks four Moody kicks two I know it wasn't a pretty night tonight for the Rams but don't you have that feeling with Sean McVay and Stafford and Kyron Williams and Puka and Cooper Cup and the young defense getting better. If they end up winning this division, I don't know if I'd want to see them on the other side of a bracket. Whatever it takes. Either it's 44-42 or a few days later it's 12-6. I mean, the name of the game is Herm Edwards. You play to win the game, period. Kittle indicates it's him. Is it? There are two fouls on the play, both by the offense. Ineligible player downfield, number 65. Penalties declined. Pass interference, number 85. Ten-yard penalty. First down. That's the bigger one. That's a rare mistake by Kittle, especially in a fourth-quarter game, in a 6-6 football game. He's just trying to work on late there. does a good job there, but at the same time, the initial contact, he grabbed a hold of him and got a hold of that jersey. And he knew it first and 20. Four-man rush, and action come in from his left side that time. He had Quentin Lake, who was just involved in that last play, blitzing from the secondary, second down to 20. Yeah, you haven't seen a ton of that, but when they have brought a little bit of pressure, it has been off and right off the edge from 37, right at the top there. He's able to get free. Gets his hands up. Look at our defensive alerts. Anytime you see these defensive alerts, it's not necessarily who's going to come, but the potential threat. And they were all over at that time with Lake coming. Yeah, Lake, the green dot, defensive play caller here. Relays the signals. Meanwhile, the pass deep downfield. Tending for Samuel is busted up by Cam Kinchers. He's made some big plays this season, third and 20. But they keep trying to get the ball to Debo Samuel. They're determined to be able to find ways to get the ball into his hands. He's right here. Watch the coverage on the back end. The ball hangs in the air so long that the safety of the corner here does a good job of reading it He in good position And he able to get underneath that Almost Kitchens almost comes up with that interception You know, he's done a good job as a rookie out of Miami of playing center field this year. Coming up with three picks for this defense. Very good. Very timely plays. Draw play here. Needed 20 and got 16 with Garendo. taking it up to the 26-yard line, but the punt team comes in on a fourth down. So that offensive pass interference really impacts this drive, gets them way behind the sticks, so the Rams get the football back here. Punt number seven for Pat O'Donnell, averaging 45 yards per boot. We got a flag at the inception of the play and it's fair caught for the moment at the 29-yard line. So that was a punt of 46 yards. And we'll see what Mr. Martin tells us as he's looking over to the Rams' benches. How do you want to? Illegal formation. San Francisco. Number 45 was lined up in the backfield. The Rams will enforce the five-yard penalty from the end of the play. First and ten. That's what they have decided. Demetrius Flanagan folds. Called for it. Stafford back to work on a six. Tell me you like health. You like health? Best move I ever saw. Okay, great. It's the gun with a win. Rams start this drive from the 33 and private parts. Stafford going deep downfield, and he's got Nakua. to the 16-yard line. Hook and Nakula got free against Travarius Ward. Biggest play of the night. There it is. We've been waiting for these shots downfield and they finally picked the right time. A little play action, a little flash of it. Actually, they catch him in a blitz, one-on-one and boy, does he get behind Ward. It's been such tight coverage on the back end with these 49ers, corners and the safeties dialing up, any kind of crossers But this time they take him downfield behind the safeties and they hit a big one. 51 yards. Rams now at the 16. Williams fighting his way. Inside the 10. Gibson makes that tackle. Second and two. Really good block there by Parkinson to tie it in on that right side. Remember the 49ers after 13 straight touchdowns that you referred to in the red zone area. The last time we saw, the last time they stopped him and forced him to kick a field goal. There's a look at Greenlaw. Still on the bench. Second and two. Ayuk is down. That's one of your guys, right? Very important. Catchman here. And a first down. And then hog tied to the ground is George Kittle. Well, whether it's man coverage or zone, you can always count on Kittle being able to win. Able to separate against man. This time it's zone, so he gets between those two linebackers. And the timing with Brock Purdy, he knew exactly where that ball needed to be thrown. Right between the two inside linebackers. Good throw, accurate throw, gives Kittle a chance. Kittle's got four for 61 yards. He's been their top receiver. First down from the 43. Play action. Purdy going deep. Broken up. Pearsall the intended receiver. And Witherspoon again getting to play tonight because Kobe Durant has hurt. So Witherspoon's seen a lot of action. You know, he goes in motion. And they get the matchup that they want. Pearsall can get downfield in a hurry. And this is a corner who's stepping in for Durant. Ball is underthrown. maybe a little bit late because Pearsall got to see him. He had a chance, and there's the length of Witherspoon to knock that football away. But Pearsall had to slow down and come back to that football. Witherspoon activated it from the practice squad. Through the middle, Dorendo has a hold and tries to back his way to the line to gain, and may have done that. We'll see where they spot it. on a second and ten. Comes up a little bit short. Third and one. That 49ers offensive line can become physical. Start to lean on you. The rookie right guard, Pune, with an amazing block. You'll see him back here. Watch the job he does at driving Johnson. Opening that hole up. And they give him a first down. As they spot the ball now. Take a look at the change. First down. At 68, McKibbitt. The kibitz as well makes a nice block. There's just something about you put a guy in a San Francisco 49ers jersey, you put him in that tailback spot, and he's going to be productive. Ushak is the fullback leading the way, but there's nothing there. So, Garenda, the question as of 24 hours ago is would he play? He's carried 16 times for 55 yards. Yeah, especially in a short week. I think they felt that if it was a full week, he wouldn't have had any problem. But they really didn't know, like you say, Al, until they came out here tonight. I think they thought Samuel might have to have a few more carries than he has up to this point running the ball. I think he's had a couple carries. Kobe Turner is back in. Along that defensive front, second and 11. Five and a half left in the fourth. Taylor is the running back. Purdy going for it all and it's going to be picked off in the end zone. Darius Williams on an overthrow. And the Rams get the takeaway. 5-14 left. After the pick, 9-6, Rams. A little confusing. Jumps back. Look at the Rams' defense react to this. late goes here McCullough says okay I got to get over here late to check and then they play cover three so really good job there by Williams he's not going to let that little stuttering go affect him and the reason the ball is under thrown a bit is the pressure by Fisk and by big 91 Kobe Turner and again good job Williams in zone coverage not letting and not being fooled by Juwan Jennings That little stutter and go in position. It comes up with a huge pick there for the Rams. Darius Williams, seven years in the league. Makes the big play here. Gives the Rams the ball with 5-14. Stafford throws and they haven't tipped. And Atwell is there. 2-2 Atwell to hold in. Dina, six. Yeah, right off the edge. Flanagan fouls, I think. Knocked that ball down. 45. right on the edge. He's got great length. Gets up there to knock it down, but how about the concentration? 2-2 Atwell. We haven't seen him much tonight, but at least not only positive yards, but more importantly, keeps that clock moving. Buffalo's seen another hand. Made that play last week. Second down and four. Play action. Rolling, throwing, caught. And that'll move the stick. Hunter Long makes the catch for a first down. But let's not just put this one away, as you know. I mean, the Rams still are trying to be aggressive. They've been aggressive on this drive. 49ers with those two timeouts, two-minute warning. If they can hold the Rams to a field goal, get the ball back to Brock Purdy, they still are thinking about having a shot here to still win this football game. So I want to see how Sean McVay approaches this, knowing that Kyle Shanahan wants to get his hands back on that football. Second and seven. Give it to Nakua on a sweep. And he'll take it to the 32. And the 49ers will let the clock run to the two-minute warning. They'll take the timeout on the front side of the three. Third down and four when play resumes. Two-minute warning in Santa Clara. nine six ramp for right now they don't be in a yard you'd be looking at 40 trying to get about a 50 yard field goal they pick up a first down to be very tough percent just gonna get the ball back they do have two timeouts but three receivers set to the right now Cup comes this way two by two pass is caught and inside the 20 and spun down is Colby Parkinson well Sean McVay would tell you that his motions are as important as the play call themselves and here is a great example of that when Cooper Cup moves he took two defenders with him. And this opens to the two defenders. It opens it up perfectly. Great recognition by the veteran quarterback. And a first down for the Rams. 2-29 go with it. Nobody's on the tight end. And look at how cool Stafford is. He knows what he has already. And just waits for him to get there. Throws it to a spot. And gets that critical first down. The Rams use that on the vast majority of plays. Motion one way or another. It's more than eye candy. Meanwhile, here's Williams again just angling his way for an extra couple of yards, and the 49ers now compelled to use their final timeout. Yeah, it's amazing. They've used it almost, I think they've used it 82% of the time. They use it more than anybody else in the league, and yet it's that play, at that moment, where the Niners have a bust, and it's happened the entire game where they haven't had a bust. And they vary it so much. I mean, sometimes they'll trot. Sometimes they go full speed. Sometimes they go back and forth with the same guy. JCPenney postgame show coming up after the game. Stick around for that. Second down and seven. Take all the time they can off the clock here. And this time the 49ers were able to bunch him up at the line of scrimmage. on Tyron Williams' 28th carry for 105 yards. Again, the postgame show coming up with Carissa and the gang exclusively on Prime Video, the JCPenney postgame show with the gang. They should be able to take this clock down to around the 25-second mark, roughly. Here's the Rams' schedule, what they have left for the Jets, Arizona, and then Seattle, Week 18. a lot on the table potentially and that winner take all possibly those two division games at SoFi the last two weeks of the season snap it one on the play clock to the 11 yard line goes Williams so now clock is under a minute take it down about that 20 second mark or so McVeigh will just let it go down he's already talking to the referee hit the timeout at one second. Well, you know, back in year one of Thursday Night Football, we had a 9-6 game. Was that Indy Denver? How could you forget? I forgot the score. That was OT, right? That was painful. And you said to me, how can they leave going over? I said, well, they've seen it out. Not this game. And this was for a 9-6 game or whatever. It's going to wind up maybe 12-6. Tough conditions. Tough conditions for sure. Playoff picture right here. Detroit, of course, is the once but the calls here by Sean McVay. Come up with a big interception in that four-minute offense meeting. You need to work the clock, run the football. instead. The first two plays, a quick throw out to the right that Atwell adjusts to, come right back. Oh, they're definitely going to run the ball here on this next. Nope. Boot and get Stafford away from the pressure and you get a new set of downs. That moving. William exploits that hole and forward Fred Warner making the tackle and spot it a little bit short this is a different defense tonight without Dre Greenlaw in the middle we know how great this guy is Fred Warner but without his sidekick it just doesn't have that same feel at the second level Rams able to run the football there you can see they control the line of scrimmage and get and get Kyron Williams, who runs physically tough, get him running downhill. Second and one. Safford keeps it himself. And he has the first down. And the clock keeps on running down. 49ers have all of their timeouts. And you also have the two-minute warning. So a ton of time, but you need to stop them. Think about this Rams team. 1-4 all the injuries you've got a veteran quarterback they're talking about when you and I had had him early in the year with the Vikings they're going to move him, maybe move Cooper Cupp who knows what, we talked about that earlier but after starting 1-4 they've won 6 of their last 8 and here they are in the ropes again in a heck of a game within this division kind of that must win mindset very much like what happened last year rolling left throwing, caught And into 49er territory goes Colby Parkinson. Take him out of bounds. That stops the clock. 3-0-1 in regulation. I like what he does here. This is earlier in the game. Watch this throw right here with Puka Nakua coming off this. You poop. You roll. The defense collapses. Look at that out there, out in that deep corner route. But he takes this safer route, which is totally understandable. He wants to be safe. He wants to get a completion. That was a big play downfield. Second and three. To the outside this time. Turning it back. Spinning. First down. So Williams last week carried 29 times. Here it is 96 hours later. He's carried 25 times with probably a couple more to come. Oh, it's impressive. Watch 79 to right tackle. Havenstein turns his body to width the defender goes with him to be able to allow Kyron Williams to be able to get out to that edge and then the spin move right off the safety. Jair Brown. Kid runs angry. 25 carries 98 yards. Why not? To the 34. On carry number 26, Warner makes the tackle. And the 49ers are going to spend their first time out here on the front side of the two-minute warning. Time out. San Francisco, their first. 30 seconds. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS. This is the playoff probability. We've got the Rams with a win. at 50% if they would lose tonight, dropped down to 23%. You can see the importance of a win tonight. And on the other side, boy, the Niners backed into a corner with all these injuries, had to win this football game tonight. If not, we're down to .1. Well, we're down to .1%, which, as I said at the beginning, is life support. Second and seven. Niners still with a two-minute warning, two timeouts, trying to hold the Rams to a field goal here. Eighth play of the drive, and play clock went all the way down, so the Rams have to take a timeout. I think both teams, Kyle Shanahan is saying yesterday, I want to see more grit. It's been a gritty game tonight. It's been pretty, but it's been very interesting. It hasn't been pretty. It's been defense. Sloppy in the first half because of the weather. Williams is carried 22 times tonight. Make it 23. And this time he is wrestled down by Jason Gibson. And we third down. Hook to Kaley. Yeah, guys, Drake Greenlaw has been taking some deep breaths while he's been on the sideline all this time. Impossible to tell if he's breathing through pain or still just trying to catch his breath. But when that defense went back out on the field, he didn't even move as if to grab his helmet. and he's sitting tight. Everybody's checking on him. I'm told he's okay. All right, so there he is, but not okay, ready to resume action here on the third and two with Cup in motion. Play clock at one. Straight drop. Chased, throws, caught, but secured short of the first down, Williams. Fred Warner makes that tackle. And so the Rams had a second and two, and it's now a fourth and two. Kyron Williams has as much respect for what he does without the football as what he does with the ball. Here he is right here, and he picks up Floyd right there, puts him on his back, and then leaks out for that check down and ends up catching a football. And I think this is why his team loves him. It's not just the way he runs the ball. It's a good job there on that blitz pick. So Josh Gardner now to give them the lead. 27-yard attempt. Operation perfect. Kick perfect. Nine and a half to go in regulation. Rams on top. Nine to six. Talk this week about Debo Samuel. wants to get the ball more. They're trying to get him to football more. It has been a tough night as far as opportunities. It's been good coverage. They've handed the football to him. Here they throw him the ball. If he catches that, it's potentially a touchdown. He gets man coverage. But seven targets. You can see just the three receptions and 16 yards. He's also carried it a couple times for three more yards. So 19 yards. Going to run this one back from a couple of yards in the end zone. and there he is, number one, Samuel, gets a touch. He wasn't going to pass up an opportunity, even though the kick was in the end zone. Meanwhile, the division playoff picture right now with the division leaders up there, the wild cards would be Minnesota, Green Bay, and Washington. Rams, of course, very much in the hunt. Falcons are two, Cardinals are as well. And for the 49ers, as we mentioned, at the top of the game tonight, Man, this is almost like, you know, you're on life support if you don't win this one. It's desperation time. From the 28-yard line. Rendo. And taken out of bounds after a very minimal game by Quinton Lake, second and nine. It's these games in December, and you start looking at the standings, and I think even Matthew Stafford feels like it's desperation time. You know, they've been through so much, sitting there at 7-6 in this division, a game back behind Seattle. They look at who they have to play tonight, look at the rest of the year. They've got Seattle at the end of the year, so still in a spot to be able to win this division, but they've got to win tonight. Yeah, San Fran's at Miami, and then Detroit comes in here, And they finish at Arizona. Use second motion. Purdy steps up, steps away. Catch is made. That was Ricky Pearsall making the grab. Pearsall's the kid who was the number one draft choice. Was shot in a robbery in San Francisco. In the summertime, spent six weeks out. Come back strong. And watch Purdy how he has to work and feel in the pocket. Step away. And as he's falling back, he's able to keep his eyes downfield and make an accurate throw to Pearsall. Really, really good feel in the pocket that time by Brock Purdy. Number one pick, Rippy out of Florida. Dorendo. About two and a half to three. Stopped there. Under eight minutes, not a play in regulation. It's pretty amazing what we just talked about with Debo Samuel. and we talked about him being vocal and wanting the ball more. You know, it's been four straight games. This will be the fifth game. There's Kobe Turner, such an important part of that defense. But this will be the fifth straight game. He's been held under 40 yards from scrimmage. You'd never think that when you think of Debo Samuel, especially with McCaffrey's down seat at the moment. Philadelphia right on their heels with that one seat. Then you've got Seattle and Tampa leading the other divisions with Minnesota, Green Bay, and Washington are the wild cards at the moment, but the Rams very much in that picture. If they get to 8-6, meanwhile, it begins to rain again. Kind of metaphorical for what the 49ers are facing right now. Cardi now for a chip shot 29-yard field goal. And the Rams have ended their last three drives with three field goals. So 18 seconds remain. Brock Purdy, this offense, the 49ers, no Christian McCaffrey, no Brandon Ayew, no Trent Williams. Tonight, 197 total yards. 197. That's the second fewest ever under Kyle Shanahan. The fewest was 164 when they played the Eagles in that 22 championship game when Brock Purdy went down with that injury. That's the Philadelphia. Big interception. Huge. Williams. Darius Williams. the Rams 10 days off teams used to moan and groan about Thursday night games now we hear almost every coach saying you know what, we like it you get right back into work and then you get the 10 days off yeah, exactly the whole thing's kind of flipped I think it's a mindset too what are you going to do, you can't change what it is so you try to take a positive spin and I think on the back end what a reward, especially if you win a football game Late in the season too, get your guys healthy. Healthy-er anyway. Evans kick. And they're going to take it out from the end zone here. And this is Samuel trying to become a major hero. And after the 36-yard line flag comes in. So you almost never see it with the new kickoff. a guy that deep in the end zone. But Debo thinks, damn, I've got to do something. Yeah, he does, and he gets a horse collar on top of it for 15 more yards. So it pays off for him. 41-yard kickoff return. Clay Martin tells us. First little foul. Horse collar tackle. Los Angeles number 21. We'll add 15 yards to the end of the run. First down. Charles Woods, the rookie out of SMU. with that penalty. So that Cardi field goal, that last one, is looming rather large at the moment. 11 seconds. Yeah, I mean, you can really, you know, I think the Rams are going to try to protect the edges. Technically, you can, if you have a play where you can get downfield and get out of bounds, or you get a play when you, can you get up to the line of scrimmage and fire it into the ground to try to kill the clock, But the Rams are protecting both edges spread all the way near the sideline. You only have one guy with his hand down. So there will be next to no rush here. And next to no play here. Yeah, Rams timeout. Timeout by the Rams. 30 seconds. Put that one second back on the clock. 11 seconds. Of course it can't be easy. I'm just thinking the same thing, right? It can't be easy. Yeah. the old Ringo Starr thing. They don't come easy. No games come easy these days, it seems. We saw the Commanders beat the Pairs on a Hail Mary. Oh, boy. Did we ever. That one went viral, didn't it? Yep. Every Kansas City game ends with a nail-biter at the end. How will this one go into the books? Ball right at the 50-yard line. So the Rams had one man with his hand down. Now you've got a little bit of a different defensive look. In a different lineup. They had trips down to the bottom. Three-man rush. Eight back. Trying to get it to Pearsall. to get out of bounds, but he can't, but they still have six seconds left. That's what you needed, and that would have been a well-designed play. He didn't panic. He didn't rush.
