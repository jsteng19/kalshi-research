 Sometimes they let you get away with it. But not that time. Terry, is there a rule on that? Like when you can, when sometimes they'll allow it and other times they don't? You see the zero as you go to the ball. That one did look like it was on zero a pretty fair amount of time. So I do think this was correct delay game. Terry McAuley checking in. Meanwhile, now he's got a second and nine. He's got Chase in the backfield for the moment. He sprints away. Pass is caught on the outside. Tyler Boyd making the grab there, and that's going to set up a third down and four. Normally, they'd be in a shotgun here, and they're trying to find a matchup that they'd like. But, you know, with the way Joe has been able to make decisions here, he's got the option here. You know, you can run the football with the way the line of scrimmage has been working in their favor, or you try to find a quick pass to get the ball out in a hurry. Tamar Chase will be off to his left. Third and four. Burrow fires over the middle. Grabbed at the 20-yard line. Making that catch, Tyler Boyd pulls it in. Keep the drive going. First down. They had him stacked behind Irwin to give him a chance to get a free release. See how he's here. He's able to get upfield, and actually Stevens tries to stay with him right at the line of scrimmage by stacking him. Joe Burrow knew what he wanted. There's the eyes of Joe Burrow. Lethal. Puts that ball in the money, and how about Boyd? He makes the drop last week, and here he comes up with a great catch. From the 20. Gets it away. Nixon to the outside. He goes in the first half for Joe. Having a big night. Marcus Williams makes the tackle. couldn't time that up any better. They had a blitz off to the right. Good job by that offensive line not tipping their hand and getting that screen. You got a first down and goal. That running game tonight. The ruling on the field is that the runner is short to line the game after a crew discussion. So originally it was going to be first and goal but now Second down and next to nothing. Can't play Mark's second quarter. Now, Mixon, having a good night. Every time he's touched the ball, it's catching it or running. It's about seven yards a touch. Needs a yard. Gets plenty. Takes it to the seven. And now it's a true first and goal. Drop started back at their own 18-yard line. And it's taken six minutes to march down the field, ten plays. And that's the other aspect of their running game, is one of their best plays of defending Lamar Jackson is trying to keep Lamar Jackson on the sideline and possessing the football. It's a heck of a drive, see if they can finish it off. They're the least penalized team, and there's another false start. The average only 4.6 yards of penalties per game. Fewest in the league. And since Zach Taylor got there in his fifth season now, the fewest since Zach took over. And Zach Taylor knows that when they get in the red zone against Lamar Jackson, you're not going to have a ton of possessions. You can't settle for field goals. They've got to put points on the board and get a touchdown. Burrow caught to the four-yard line goes Mixon. Patrick Queen makes the tackle there. Clock running down, 6.15 to go in the half. 7-3 is the score, second down and goal. It was a really well-designed play. Just Mixon getting behind Jamar Chase there. Made Queen hesitate. Created an easy opening for Joe Burrow to throw that ball out there. picked up some of the yards from that penalty. To the outside. Reaching down, making the grab, and taking it to the end zone goes Joe Mixon. So his great night continues. Makes the grab there, throw a little bit low, a little celebration in the end zone, and the Bengals take the lead. It sure looks like they're attacking these linebackers, which we didn't think they would do coming in. But watch Boyd here. Just talked about Jamar Pace kind of set down until, see if he can come back to do after halftime. Right. Browning has one career attempt. He played in one game in his NFL debut in week one, a loss to Cleveland, even though he was on a Minnesota practice line. Lankins for a couple years. A fake toss here. And a pass is caught right on the money and taken in by Trenton Irwin. for a gain of 11 on the first down. He says, take that. Take that. That's what I can do. First throw out. And this is where you find out as a backup quarterback, what kind of mental reps you've been taking. Jake Browning, an intelligent guy, covered him a lot in college at Washington. Moment won't be too big for him. Two-minute warning. Ravens by four. In case you're wondering, it's at halftime. from the 37-yard line on first down, Joe Mixon to the 40. Still have that one timeout. Again, Jake Bryan, you go back to the, oh, you've got a flag here. The experience that he gained at Washington, because he doesn't have a whole lot of NFL experience, but it gives him a feeling for situational instincts. Legal use of the hands, hands to the face, defense, number 99. that five-yard penalty will be added to the result of the play. Automatic first down. Bennafe Olwe. Olwe is a guy that seems to be really coming into his own in his third year. There's the hand up into the face there. Again, more room to run for the Bengals. This guy was the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year in 2016. Browning. And that's incomplete. That's on the pressure put on by Roquan Smith, who's been pretty quiet. He's coming off a game in which he had 21 tackles. Story high last week, former Chicago Bear. Third in the league in tackles. How about this job right here? How about Joe Mixon? Bang! I mean, he is so explosive. Bring him off the edge instead of up the middle. He says, Joe Mixon, I've been trying to tackle you. I'm going to run right through you this time. One of the best all-time pregame speeches tonight. Second down and ten. The screen is set up, and Mixon is able to one-hand it. What a night he continues to have. Gets away from Patrick Queen. Turns what might have been an incomplete pass into a nice little gain here. They go screen again. Not just the fact that he caught the football. Then he shakes Queen. And he gets out of bounds. I mean, that's about as good as you can do there from Mixon. He has eight carries for 46. He has four catches for 31. Third down and three. Browning fires. And what a grab. Trent Irwin making the catch through a bullet. Irwin holds it in. He had to work to get open. They hide this, but Chase gets taken away. He looks there initially and then works through the progressions and finds Irwin. When they double Jamar Chase, someone else has to make a play. Great poise and gives Irwin a chill. That ball may have touched the ground. That's why they're going to take a peek. All reviews, of course, in the last two minutes. Upstairs here. Juggles has it there, has it there. Terry McCauley indicating to us as the crowd thinks no. And we will find out. The view, it was determined that the receiver did not maintain control of the ball going to the ground. Their ball is an incomplete pass. It will be 4-7-3 on the 48-yard line. So here it is again. And it would have been a first down at the 38, resetting the game clock here. Instead, Irwin could not hang on with the duration. Ball comes back to the 48, and they got a fourth down and three. Yeah, again, a heck of a job by the quarterback, Jake Browning, just because he's working through his progressions. The ball placement there gave Irwin a chance, but unable to secure it. It's a third drop now for the Bengals in his first half. Very interesting call here for Zach Taylor. Do you go for it? You got a quarterback with no experience Fall in midfield you want to give it back to Baltimore they have all three timeouts That midfield in a four-point game. What's he gonna do? Is he just gonna try to draw them offside or really go for it? This group as he backpedals fires and that's caught on the other side of the 50-yard line And hauled in there by Trenton Irwin for a first down. He's in rhythm here. I mean, you can tell the preparation that he's put in. Watch Irwin on this route work across. It really sells it to Queen 6. Like he's going to work across to the field and he comes back. The timing is excellent. Good job by Jake Browning in rhythm. A couple hitches. And a good ball to the technician that time, Trenton Irwin. At the 47. So Browning three for his first five. Running back is Travion Williams. Play action. Tight little roll. Look out. Escapes the sack. Gets a block. Takes off. Slides to a stop at the 40-yard line. You know what I'm thinking right now? This guy has very little experience, even though he's been around the NFL for, you know, Minnesota practice squad. I'm thinking about Joshua Dobbs. Why? Heck yeah. Why not? I tell you what, very cerebral in the very same way that Dobbs is. And he plays like he's just a guy that's poised. You know, he played a lot of football in college. I've seen him do that a lot because I called a lot of his games when he was at Washington. He'll surprise you with his athleticism to be able to get away from trouble and then just get down. Not wow you, but enough to be able to stay positive and keep the sticks in a good place. Second and five. going deep one-on-one and it's incomplete a lot of contact but no flag there intended for shedra Jackson and that time we had Kyle Hamilton blitzing third down and five I mean you know with Dobbs it reminds me so much that Dobbs was around for a long time finally gets a little bit of a break last year in Tennessee then we know what's happening to him this year in Minnesota it's been crazy. That's become one of the great stories, I think, in the league. In the way he's doing it. I think everybody, because of who he is, everybody's rooting for him, right? It's become all of a sudden the Vikings lose Kirk Cousins and they're a team everybody wants to watch and trying to make a run to get into the postseason. Yeah, very easy guy to root for. Third and five. And that play is blown dead before it's inception alright third down make it 10 you know you're thinking about the old days what 20 minutes ago if you had a guy who had no experience as a backup quarterback forget about it you know you want to lose the game now in today's world these guys come out of nowhere like a dobs who knows with browning other guys anyway you got Zach Taylor going crazy here on the sideline. I think he's had enough with some of the officiating tonight. Third down and ten. Here comes the blitz. He gets it away. Irwin is there. Contact is made and a flag is thrown to in fact. So that time he had Rak Yasin bumping into him. And that will take the ball deep into Ravens territory. He got hit hard after he threw that ball by Clowney. Number 23. Ball will be placed at the spot of the foul. Automatic first down. Clowney and Smith that time. Bolton coming in. Again, it's underthrown deep ball. Defensive back never sees the football. Receiver trying to come back. An easy interference call. And there's the hit right as he released it. He's lucky he got that ball out with Clowney and his length at 6'5". But he got it out. Now they catch a break with the interference inside the 15. A 34-yard penalty. Six penalties against the Ravens tonight for 89 yards. Probing for a gain of two, Joe Mixon. Starting to figure out what Brian Callahan and Zach Taylor want to do against Mike McDonald in this defense with an inexperienced quarterback. They've been very fortunate to find this running game tonight, be able to take some of the pressure off the line, take some of the pressure off of now Browning. They kind of hand the OC, but it's Taylor who calls the plays. Chris Evans in the game off to the right. Browning steps up, steps away, keeps it alive, Looks for the sideline. Then goes out of bounds. Spot the ball around the eight or so. In six games. And that kick is no good. And that's the first time this season in ten games that a Raven opponent has missed a field goal. So the score remains 7-3. And back we come in 30 seconds. There's Lamar Jackson in the huddle. Checking out the plays. And ready to start here with good field position after the missed field goal. Starting from his own 43-yard line. Ravens up by four. Keaton Mitchell is in the backfield looking for room. And he gets swallowed up right there. Logan Wilson is in on the tackle. We want to go back to the two injuries. Of course, the Andrews one is serious, far more serious. Wilson was involved in both of those tackles. Yeah, and both times he was bringing them down from behind. like this, but it's definitely the hip drop there, and Lamar Jackson fortunate he was able to avoid that. Good to see, again, back out there. Ravens got to get their running game going. They're number one in the NFL with rushing offense, and got to be able to win that line of scrimmage. Second and nine. A dart over the middle is incomplete. Everybody wants a flag in the stadium, and here comes one in from the side. Dax Hill covering. Isaiah likely on the play. for a late flag. I think that left arm may have hooked there. It was one-on-one. We wondered how they would do without Mark Andrews. I think the left hand grabs around the hip. Keep an eye on that. Yeah, right there. Yeah, that's Dax Hill. His brother plays on the other side. Justice Hill. Mitchell stays in. Jackson going deep and is batted away at the last moment. So intended for Bateman and batted away by Cam Taylor Britt. Nice play. Cam Taylor Britt stepped up last year when they had an injury to Owuse, and now he's been able to become the guy. A turnover machine, four interceptions on the year, and he's got him by a couple steps. That ball's thrown pretty well, but you see the speed that he has to be able to make up and get that right hand up and knock that football away. Yeah, Rashad Bateman was their number one pick. And a Minnesota back in 21. So twice he's gone deep. Here comes the blitz from the outside. Jackson avoids that for the moment and picks up a couple on the ground. Mike Filton is there. It'll be third down, third and eight. Great job of disguising this blitz. I think at the last second, Lamar Jackson sees this blitz coming from his left to our right. He wants to go to a hot right there. receiver doesn't adjust with him so he's got nowhere to go with the football. Hilton got him as he crossed the line of scrimmage. Third down and eight. Lou Anaruma knows they've got to do a good job of hiding it. Sean pre-snap to post-snap for Lamar Jackson. Jackson chased under pressure throws it away. So heavy pressure put on by the Bengals that time, including Jordan Battle coming in from the secondary, and it's 4,000. They walk seven up there, and he's mixing up these looks. Sometimes he'll show six or seven, and then he'll drop, rely on the front to be able to get home like Henderson did earlier, and then this time they decide to just bring the house and get to Lamar Jackson before he can get out of there and scramble and make you pay for it. You see Lou Anarumo. Shouldn't everybody from Staten Island be named Lou? Absolutely. It's perfect. He's got the personality to fit. Absolutely. Jordan Stout to putt. Short kick. Fielded at the 18-yard line and taken down immediately is Charlie Jones. So you've got two quarterbacks here. Each guy has won a Heisman, 19 for Joe. And then 101. And now you get the same thing here with Boyd to the linebacker, Wurlquan Smith slows him down just enough for Joe Burrow to again find that matchup. The back against the linebacker, whether it's a screen or the last two plays, they're attacking the backers in man coverage. McPherson for the point after. And with 5.49 to go in the opening half. In Baltimore, the Bengals have their first lead of the night. 10-7. Oh, Joe, take a look at that. The screen grabbed down, but enough people saw it today. When they got off the plane, he had some sort of a device on his right hand. Looked like a sleeve or whatever. Something was going on. They took it down. But clearly you've got some sort of an issue here, and we'll get to the bottom of it eventually. Not only that, this is a play before where Clowney hits him and drives him to the ground. You see that right hand is, I don't know if that added to it, but as soon as he made that last stroke, you saw it as soon as the ball was released, he kind of grabbed, clutched his hand into the tent. So meanwhile, the Ravens come back out. Jackson, his number is right there, 16 through the air. Of course, the Bengals have dominated on the ground tonight. Mixing a big first half. And now we'll find out about the Ravens down by three. First drive with a healthy Mark Andrews. He was three of three, 56 yards. And since then, one of five for four yards. This time they give it on the end of round. This is Flowers and the rookie with a nice run here. Picking up about six up to the 31-yard line. Taken down by Cam Taylor Britt. The Bengals have stacked the line of scrimmage trying to take away this running game of the Ravens. and Baltimore's answer to that has been they have thrown quite a bit. At some point, you've got to believe Todd Monkins goes back to the running game where he can rely on the interior that this offensive line and the big fullback Ricard at 300 pounds. Second and three to the outside. They go to Flowers again. There goes the rookie. Flowers with a block for Mitchell, But you got a flag down. There's a flag down. So for the moment, he's into the end zone. That would be 68 yards. But they're coming back. It's against the Ravens. It's a run pass option where you have linemen potentially downfield. This is going to be a hold on OBJ. He can hand this off or flip it out. He had the blitz by Mike Hilton. So he gets that ball out in a hurry. This gives you an idea what Zay Flowers can do. Here's crowd reacting to what OBJ does to a Ruzio here. He grabs onto that jersey within that black. That's a very questionable hit at all. That should have been let go. That should be a touchdown for the Ravens. Of course, the crowd sees the replay. Meanwhile, there's a lot. Whoa! Here's Burrow shaking his head. After trying to throw on the sideline, you can tell there's a problem. Big one. This is an official timeout for an administrative issue. An administrative issue, so probably looking at the clock. Meanwhile, a ton going on here. Here's Burrow. He's going to go back to the locker room. I think there's a drone in the stadium right now could be Anyway, got Jake Browning is the backup quarterback gay Meanwhile with burrow Kaylee Browning will be the quarterback When they get the ball back for the moment second down and nine With Jackson in the pocket those of the outside Edwards makes the catch And Edwards gets taken down after a short game this Bengals defense had really a tough time against CJ Stroud and the Texans 12 missed tackles 544 yards look at Jake Browning right now going over things just in case he needs to be ready to go but they played well, this defense played well outside of that opening drive third down and five Jackson fires over the middle that's caught on the run you got Beckham, OBJ for a big game and a first down for the Ravens on the 28-yard gallant-hulled and stable franchise in Baltimore. Cincinnati won the toss. Bengals have deferred. Ravens to get the ball. And off we go from Baltimore on this Thursday night, starting with a touchback. And that means we will see Lamar Jackson in his sixth season in the league. Back in 19, he was not only the MVP, but in a unanimous vote won it. There he is against the Bengals, 7-1. Great success, 3-1 touchdown interception ratio. Try to again stay healthy. He's missed 10 games over the last two years, and they really paid the price. He seems to be getting more and more settled each week with some new receivers, a new scheme with Todd Munkin, and really a balanced approach with what they do on offense. Smoke from the fireworks, still clearing. Off play action on first down, downfield, caught, 39-yard line. It begins with a Mark Andrews reception, the big tight end, picking up 14 yards on the first down. And this is an area that I feel like he's really improving. A lot of times you see these throws, and they're thrown just on a line. Here he's got to layer it up and over Davis Gaither and a great route to his top target in Mark Andrews. They came in together in the draft. They've got incredible chemistry, and they start this game off in a good way for the Raiders. From the 39-yard line, that's Zay Flowers, the rookie, goes into the slot on the left side. Now he moves Patrick Ricard, the fullback, to a wing on the left side. And keep it on the ground here. Edwards looking for room, and Edwards gets stopped after a gain of one. D.J. Reeder makes the stop there, minus Stanley, Ronnie Stanley, their great left tackle. He is out. All-pro back in 19, Pro Bowl selection. So Patrick McCary takes that spot. Yeah, McCary is capable of playing really anywhere on this offensive line. One of the more valuable commodities that any offensive line can use. A guy that can bounce around tonight. He's got to fill in for Stanley. Worthy matchup worth watching tonight, especially on these third downs. On second and nine. Hanging in the pocket. Throws under pressure. There's the rookie. Flowers. Great move. Inside the 40, he goes. And out of bounds inside the 30-yard line for the rookie out of Boston College, who is their number one draft choice. Now the Bengals double up. Andrews on the left. And you'll see just a little whip route here by the rookie. Such quickness. He's going up against another rookie, D.J. Turner, and just gets separation. What I love to see is Lamar Jackson sitting in the pocket, and a lot of pressure around him keeps his vision downfield and makes a great throw and a nice block downfield there by Isaiah Lightley. Now in the backfield, you've got Keaton Mitchell, who's as fast as they come a rookie out of East Carolina. Instead, it is Jackson who just keeps it after faking the handoff, taking it to the 19-yard. I can't wait to watch this Keaton Mitchell in action. Get him in space any time you can, and get between Lamar Jackson in space and now the rookie Mitchell, what he can do. This offense is very, very challenging because they can attack downhill with their interior inside run game, and then they can work the edges, as he did right there with Cam Sample on his own read. He collapsed down, and he dances around him for seven or eight yards. Out of the pistol. Deaton is the tailback. Once again, Flowers is the man in motion. Give it to Mitchell who starts to slip. Couldn't get his footing as he took the handoff there. Akeem Davis Gaither in on the stop, setting up a third and short. Bengals loading up the line of scrimmage. You have to take away the run against Lamar Jackson and try to hold up on islands, playing man-to-man. Go without a huddle here. Go five wide. Jackson under pressure. Slips away. Keeps it. Picks up the first down. Stopped at the 13-yard line. That running attack, you know, you look at that running attack right now with Edwards. They had hoped to have J.K. Dobbins as a one-two punch. Now they've got Mitchell, and, of course, you've got number eight who can always run. Yeah, especially on third down. You know that's a weapon. And he told us again this week, he tells everybody any chance he can, I want to throw first and run second. He's been saying that since his days in Louisville in college because he can do both. but he's electrifying when he does pull it down that time. The Bengals losing contain, which is exactly what they did not want to do on third down, and he makes them pay for it. Approaching 5,000 career rushing yards on the opening drive. Andrews, slip move. Battle runs him down. Last time they were at third down, they brought pressure. This time they're just going to rush four, and watch the head of Lamar Jackson. Left, work through the progressions, move the linebacker, Logan Wilson. Knows exactly where he wants to go. Good job of being patient. Knows that he has time. Puts it right on the money for that first down. To the 41-yard line. Running back is Justice Hill. Stays into block. Jackson all night. And tomorrow morning as well. But the secondary does this work. Runs into his own man and gets taken down. He ran into Kevin Zeitler after all that. That's one way to stop number eight. What do you think? Right. I mean, use anybody, whether it's the umpire, a referee, your own offensive lineman. I mean, he had all day. And, of course, your biggest fear, that's great coverage. Your fear is that he's going to take off and go. Take a look at Odell Beckham trying to get behind his coverage. He's back there, but you've got a defender with him in Dax Hill. Second and 12. over the middle. That's caught outside the 40-yard line, and Justice Hill takes it to the 37. Down to Kaylee we go. Guys, Joe Burrow is still in the x-ray room here, but we're already told he's questionable to return because of his right wrist. Okay, that's the word. Grasping, clutching, but he's out, at least for the moment. Ball at the 37 for Baltimore and there is the very seldom used Jake Browning. Lamar in the pocket. That's caught in a lot of traffic by Nelson Aguilar to the end zone. Somersault touchdown. The flag to throw it down to the bottom by the Ravens sideline Right at the 37 line the Ravens are signaling touchdown but what are the officials going to tell us right now Field judge making the call. They've already had one touchdown taken away. Illegally used to hand. Hands to the face. Defense. Yeah, not this time. So Nelson Aguilar, who had a big day in week two against Cincinnati, into the end zone he goes. Pratt gets his hands on this football. This ball is actually intended to likely, right over the middle, the ball is tipped. Great awareness by Aguilar to catch that tipped ball. And you can see the speed that he has. But Jermaine Pratt did a great job of reading that. Ravens turned into a touchdown. He had to no avail. Tucker for the point after. A lot going on then. In Baltimore, 220-14-10. Here's the tip. Pratt gets back. He shows blitz. He gets back. He thinks he's made a great play. But look at that. The ball just falls right into the hands of Aguilar. I think a lot of defenders reacted to that tip. So Aguilar, once he caught that, he had a lot of room. Well, we talked about the AFC North. The division I call wild and woolly. This one living up to it tonight. Of course, the big question now becomes Burrow. Can he play tonight? What happens to him? You don't know. Because if you have to go to the backup Browning, he has almost no experience. Yeah, very little experience. And Joe Burrow, I mean, it's like Kansas City losing Mahomes. You know, you're talking about an elite player. You build your entire offensive plan and scheme around him. One thing that Cincinnati's been able to do, they've been able to run the football, which has been a surprise. And I'm sure now with Browning coming in, it's going to be quick passes and see if you can still run the football. But right now, Zach Taylor's just trying to come up with a plan. You know, when you build everything around number nine, now you've got to adjust. Yeah, you have to, no question about it. Zach calls the plays when Brian Callahan is the offensive coordinator. But Taylor calls the plays. Got to revamp that whole game plan tonight going forward. Meanwhile, Bengals trail by four. And they get the ball at the 25. So we're going to see Browning, who's been around. He played at Washington. He was a four-year starter up in Seattle. And there is Burrow. which way is he going is the question. Well, with 2.20 to go in his first half, he's probably just shut it down. First drive went where Lamar was on fire. He counted for 71 of the 75 yards. I think he'll stick to the plan. From the 25, play action. Ton of time. Going deep downfield. Incomplete. That was Beckham. Odell Beckham Jr. in his first year as a Baltimore Raven. He had Cam Taylor-Britt covering on the play. He aired that one out over 50 yards but incomplete. At Jordan Battle, the safety kind of bought in on the deep crosser by Aguilar, so it created a one-on-one on the outside. And that's a very dangerous proposition for Cam Taylor-Britt. He gets behind him by a couple steps, and they just miss a massive play there to start this second drive. Second and ten. it was a little bit of an awkwardness on that handoff and then Trey Hendrickson, who was injured last week, he was a guy who was on the injury report this week, takes Keaton Mitchell down in the backfield. Well, one of the things that the Bengals knew that they had to do on these zone read looks is they want to be able to take away that big playability, whether it's Lamar or they're handing it off. That time, ideally, Lamar Jackson's able to pull that away from Mitchell because you can see Hendrickson collapse down in a hurry. So on his own read, you've got to pull that ball. Third and 14. And a whistle. And flag is down at the 43. Four minutes in formation. Deep in. Okay. So slightly more manageable. Third and nine now from the 26-yard line. Lou Anarumo, defensive coordinator. When Taylor got the job in 19, he and Lou had been together in Miami. Brought him in as the D.C. He's a little testy after last week against Houston. He's trying to get this defense to get back to playing with their capability of being able to be aggressive. Yeah, the defense was apologetic last week. Meanwhile, no apologies there that time. That's Hendrickson. And tweaked his knee last week. There was some question as to whether he'd be ready to play, but he certainly is as he comes in, gets the sack. They show some blitz up the middle. It creates a little one-on-one opportunity. And this is the matchup we wondered about without Ronnie Stanley. McCary in there for him. And Hendrickson is as good as anybody on third down when he just gets such a quick get-off. And that first step got him around the corner to come up with that sack. So they start missing the home run shot. Now you've got Jordan Stout with a punt that will be fielded at the 34-yard line by Charlie Jones. Just came off the injured list, and he brings it back out to the 38-yard line. 5.45 to go in the opening quarter in Baltimore. It's 7-3 Ravens. Bengals in their own 38-yard line. Mixon. nothing Raven defense which has been so huge through the years you got Malik Harrison there and his friends as well Malik Harrison just gets off a block there by Mitchell Wilcox remember we talked about the Bengals struggling to run the ball if you are going to try to run on this defense it's best to get to the edge from that outside stretch player the toss take that third step and then get north and south you can't get too wide because these linebackers can fly second and ten see Burrow again trying to communicate get everybody on the same page same thing that just happened he's got to be extremely frustrated and again you've got four tight ends who are active and that's the second time that's happened in the last few minutes. Yeah keep in mind with T. Higgins down it really has impacted what these guys can do. You've got Shedrick Jackson out there trying to get on the same page. Jamar Chase on the right. Burrow is trying to... No, you stay. Nope, nope. Okay. Tanner Hudson, you come over here. Let's get Jackson over there. Burrow's heading to heck with it. Get another timeout. Yeah. And meanwhile, it's on the road trying to communicate. Very tough to do. There's a look at T. Higgins. So they've used two of their three timeouts. Of course, It's a heck of a lot more important in the second half than the first. Second down and 10 from the 38. Four-man rush. Burrow to the outside with a 50-yard line. And the pass incomplete. When Lamar won it with Louisville. Burrow was a top pick and then Jackson was picked in the first round. But the last guy in the first round. Meanwhile, two guys who you'd like to get a loan from. You know, it's a movable feast. Who's the highest paid guy in the league? It changes. Justin Herbert got involved in it for a couple of minutes. Mahomes early. Yep. And late. More will be coming. Yeah. From the 18-yard line. Through the middle. Nice little hole there for Joe Mixon. Now in his seventh season. Second round pick out of Oklahoma back in 17. Just again, a different looking. If you told me we'd be into the second quarter and the Bengals would already be hit close to over 50 yards rushing, I'd say there's no way. They haven't been able to run the football much, you know, 74 for the game. They're dead last in the NFL. But these linemen are getting up to those backers, Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen, and giving these backs room to run. Yeah, and they're averaging eight yards per carry. Second down and four. Burrow has a ton of time but the secondary does its job and tries to throw it underneath and that's incomplete intended for Irv Smith to tie it in. It'll be third down and four. And see that's what the running game does. It's not just wow they're running the football. It changes the complexity of the line of scrimmage and it allows Joe Burrow as he saw in that play now he didn't find anybody but with the offensive line that struggled to protect him much of the year. That time he had all kinds of time and it's a compliment of the running game that helps not just Joe out, but it helps that offensive line out. Third and four. Pressure again. The throw. Reaching up, grabbing it. 45-yard line. That's Tanner Hudson for a first down. Matched up one-on-one with Queen. He had a safety over top trying to help him out, but he's just going to go out and then up, and Queen's got to be able to try to stay with him with his speed. It's something he's more than capable of doing, but I think he expected him to continue down to the outside towards the sideline, and then he turned up field. Burrow gets the ball out of his hands in a hurry to give Tanner Hudson, all of a sudden has become a go-to guy here these last few weeks, a chance to make a play. Two catchers tonight. That was good for 21 yards. Burrow four out of ten now. Joe Mixon after the midfield logo. Second down. Ted Karras doing a pretty good job up front. He's got his hands full with Michael Pierce and moving in different players there in that interior. Pierce is a monster, 355 pounds. He was out last year with a torn bicep in week three. And he just, believe it or not, he doesn't just occupy space and eat up linemen. He can get a push. But right now, Karras holding his own in the middle. They had to revamp that offensive line last year, and then this year, of course, brought in Orlando Brown. That was the big pickup from Kansas City. Second and seven. Big connection over the middle. That's caught, 40-yard line. That time it's Drew Sample. And it should be four. They have four tight ends active tonight. There's one of them. And now when you run the football, look what happens when you give a little play-action look to the linebackers. not being able to see this all year. You give a little look. You freeze Queen because he's got to respect the fact that they're running downhill into those linebackers. You freeze him. His eyes are in the backfield. Tight end's able to slip behind him. Chase goes into the slot. Flares out to the outside. He wants on the ground again, doing a good job on that ground to the 33-yard line. Kappa led the way that time. Mix has now carried six times for 41 yards. Good call. Al Kappa, the right guard, pulling around. You'll see him. You'll also see big Orlando Brown at the top, able to get up. Look how they're getting up to that second level, Volson. Again, you've not seen this all year from this offensive line and this running game. They're dead last in the NFL. So this is a pleasant surprise for Cincinnati, and especially number nine, Joe Burrow. play clock at one and they don't get it off in time play clock went to double zero delay game and Joe's frustrated I think he thought he got that off yeah watching the clock went going through all the gyration all they're trying to do is draw them offside only gave it the best shot I would have been shocked like I said you come into a game like this coaching to win coaching not to lose but that would have been ultra aggressive even in this world of analytics that we live in. Obviously the smart decisions punt this ball away. Even with Joe Burrow, that might have been a curious call. So Brad Robbins will punt. He's a rookie out of Michigan. They picked him in the sixth round. You've got Duvernay back there. He's returned every kickoff and punt that's been returned by a Raven this season. And the Ravens, when they get the ball Back will have all three timeouts in a minute and a half or so. Line drive boot to the corner. And that will spin into the end zone and come out to the 20-yard line. Meanwhile, in a night of very significant injuries, of course, it all started back with this. Mark Andrews getting taken down and done for the night. Has left the stadium. There's Jackson going down. A little scary moment there. Yeah, Logan Wilson again, but he's okay. Been able to come back. Here's Burrow. Something was going on before the game, too. Yeah, and the same reaction that he had on the sidelines where Kaylee was down there with him when he threw the ball. Holding his wrist, you know. Just can't grab the football. We think it's a thumb, pick, whatever. But the report, the wrist, and that's what he was hanging on to. Meanwhile, Jackson retreats. Jackson under pressure. Jackson gets chased and throws it away. Again, been very impressed. Get Mark Andrews down makes this offense feel differently. Let's just be candid. You know, the first drive with Mark Andrews, they went right down the field. And since he's gone down with that injury, they've lost their rhythm. And now the Bengals have something to do with that and the way they've been able to play. But this is not the same offense without Big 89 out there. second and ten just to sell in the backfield rush four jackson to the outside that's incomplete trying to get that one to isaiah likely third down and ten now he he started to look inside he did everything you're supposed to do when the quarterback starts to scramble just to get away kind of feel a spot, but watch his look to his left just for a moment. And I think that brief look to the inside affected his vision on the football there. So now they're third and ten. Send an extra man over the middle too high. It almost picked off. Flag comes in. That's battle. Almost had it. Meanwhile, Flag is at the 38-yard line. Pass interference. Defense. Number 22. Ball will be placed at the front of the foul. Automatic. First down. On a woojie egg. They're playing man-free, so you've got to hold up in man coverage. Guys are on islands to the right there at the top of the route. He just grabs on to the jersey. That's third and ten. It even happened before that, right at the top of the route. So he definitely held, and Ravens catch a break. First down, 33, 73 seconds to the half. Jackson fires, caught at the 47-yard line. That's Beckham turned one way, then the other. Brings the ball back quickly to the middle of the field. Meanwhile, you've got a bangle down, and that is B.J. Hill, the defensive tackle. He went down right at the snap of the football. It wasn't a hit. It was just him coming off the football. Cincinnati will be charged with their third timeout of the half. He goes down. That's an automatic timeout that is charged. You know, the minus Sam Hubbard. Now they look like they're without Hill at least. Their next opponents that they have remaining, all 500 or better. Tough schedule. The hill on the sideline. Meanwhile, first down here from the 48. Jackson escapes. Throws. Caught. Flag down. Isaiah likely made that catch flag down back at the 42. It's going to be a holding on John Simpson, the left guard. Holding. Offense. Number 76. Number 76. 10-yard penalty. The replay, second back. Correction, first out. He's just trying to save Lamar Jackson. Lamar Jackson doesn't need a lot of help to get outside of a pocket right in the middle of your screen as he pulls away. Right there, just pulls him down. Lamar Jackson's at least trying to get into field goal range with those three timeouts remaining. Remember, the Bengals do get the ball to start the second half. So they're trying to hold on the best they can here. So Hill on the sideline. looking okay. First and 20. From the 38-yard line, send an extra man. Jackson deep downfield, and that's incomplete. Everybody wants a flag, and they get one. You got Zay Flowers there, and you got D.J. Turner covering on the play, and they're moving down in that direction. Pass interference. I'm trying to see if it didn't happen early. I mean, again, the right arm may have come around his side. It's rookie on rookie. Turner out of Michigan and Zay Flowers, Boston College. They're speed against speed. Ball under thrown. I don't see anything. I don't know how you call it. Neither does Terry as he just said back in Connecticut 28 yard penalty the ball is at the 34 yard line pressure again pass is caught spinning away standing inbounds OBJ spun away from Camp Taylor Brick Beckham loves the lights I tell you that He does. He loves the big stage. Usually he's going to step up when it's prime time. And they gave him a soft coverage, so now you've got to make a tackle. You know, that's Odell Beckham who's getting healthier and healthier. He gets right around Taylor Britt. Everybody from the Ravens organization said he's getting better and better. Jackson. Takes that. Steps out. You go back in Beckham's career, I did the game with Chris Collinsworth that night at the Meadowlands, he made that unbelievable catch as a rookie. Yeah, it just changed his life forever. It did, and, you know, that's why he loves the life. Oh, yeah. He loves it. No doubt about it. And I tell you, I mean, you could see the effort that they made by bringing in Odell Beckham and Zay Flowers, the rookie to go along with Andrews and Bateman. You bring in Nelson Aguilar. Clearly an effort to get better on the perimeter to help Lamar out. Yeah, and it reminds me the Rams brought him in. He was having a great Super Bowl until he tore his ACL at the end of the first half. Second and eight. Jackson to the end zone. He got action there, too, but no flag. Beckham covered on the play that time by Mike Hilton. Third down. I see here's some murmurs here from this crowd, but that ball is uncatchable. So good. No call. You know, with Burrow down, we don't know if he's going to be able to come back or not. You're trying to keep this at a one possession game. Sure. It's a big play here. Third and eight. to force him to go for three, or can they keep rolling for seven? Jackson fires. Caught. Bateman, touchdown. Seven plays in 67 seconds from their own 20. And that's the threat of Lamar Jackson. Right, he takes off the run to make you feel threatened. And then once you get out of position, he's going to throw the football. Bateman, first round pick. A couple of years to go. Into the end zone, he goes with 23 seconds. Tucker for the point after. And it's 21-10. That's Bateman's first touchdown reception Takes it inside the five-yard line The tight end And Andrews is hurt So Mark Andrews makes the catch Slides inside And is in agony right now as he gets taken down by Logan Wilson And the training staff coming out there in a hurry Wilson rolled up on him when he made that tackle And you can see them, we thought, going to commercial So you saw Jackson taking his helmet off. It looked to be more serious than apparently. It has turned out he's able to walk off. And Andrews goes to the sideline. Here's what they are trying to get out of the league, the hip drop tackle. We'll get into that later. But in the meantime, you've got a second down and one here. And through the middle goes Gus Edwards, close to a first down. We want to keep an eye on Mark Andrews. We talked about him even first play of the game. They went to him. such a significant part of what the Ravens can do. So it's a big loss for this offense. But they do pick up the first down. And they go two tight ends here. Isaiah Likely and Charlie Kolar. Ninth play of the opening drive coming. Started back at the 25. They have five runs, three passes. Little flip here. Edwards looks for room. Into the end zone. Touchdown. Gus Edwards with a mini-leap right there. Perfect opening drive. I was going to say, that's the way you want to get it started. Nine plays, 75 yards, a little bit of run, a little bit of pass, scramble on third down, get into the red area, take advantage of every possession you get. John Harbaugh told us that. Zach Taylor told us that. It's an AFC North game. When you get your opportunities, you've got to put a touchdown on the board. Andrew's walking along the sideline. Meanwhile, for Edwards, he's living in the end zone these days. Eight touchdowns in his last five games. Justin Tucker, who will someday make an induction speech in Canton to kick the extra point. I'm guaranteeing it. You agree, right? I agree. Five minutes into the game, 7-0, and we're going to see Joe Burrow when the Bengals come out on the field. They just get out in front of a few big polling linemen. and it's fun to watch Tyler Lenderbaum, the center, really athletic, undersized, but has leverage, has a former wrestler, C78, getting out there as well. It's a lead play, able to get north and south and punch it in to finish that drive off. Bengals defense going, getting sideline to sideline there, and good job of just finding that crease and getting behind those linemen for that touchdown. Yeah. John Harbaugh, Jackson's been his man ever since they drafted him. He was the last guy picked in that draft, 32nd pick. On the other side, Burrow was the first guy in his draft. And, you know, it's interesting because Lamar came out early, so his sixth year, Burrow's fourth year. But Lamar is actually younger than Joe. Right. Not by much. let's see how Joe and this offense respond remember the Ravens under Harbaugh 19-3 at home in primetime games and 7-0 on Thursday nights Tucker to kick off Travion Williams is back he'll let it bounce through the end zone and the Bengals will begin their first drive from the 25 yard line Joe Burrow fourth here 4-1 in his last five games. He had that calf injury. Happened the second day of training camp. It limited any practice time, no game time during preseason. Worked his way back, tweaked it in week two against Baltimore game. They lost at home. And says he's completely healthy now, or at least very close to it. Nixon is in the backfield. Earl retreating under pressure. Avoids the sack. Going to keep it. And an eight-yard gain out to the 33-yard line. He got away from 0-8, second down and a couple. I think in his last five games since he's been healthy, they've gotten off to fast starts. They've gone down every opening drive and put a touchdown up on the board. And I think his energy and just the way this offense responds, that was an example right there. That was the first three weeks of the season. That's either a throwaway or a sack. Now you can see what the mobility does, puts him at second and three. Toss, Nixon, first down. Taking a couple of guys with him. Nice run. Taking Patrick Queen with him, number six. Great linebacker. He and Roquan Smith made some tandem linebacker of the season. Again, they're playing some man-to-man down in their red zone area. There's a good look at him. Bateman gets locked up on Cam Taylor-Britt, But because he breaks contain, he's able to be a threat as a runner. It made Hilton, the safety, step up to try to take away that threat. And then Cam Taylor Britt just lost Bateman in one-on-one coverage. His back turned to the football. He turned back to look at the quarterback. And then he lost the receiver, Bateman. Great execution by the Ravens there to put a touchdown up on the board. Meanwhile, Lamar, I mean, all of a sudden you look at the statistics, 187 passing yards in this half. How did that happen? A couple touchdowns. That first drive was great. And the last drive probably his two best drives of the half. On the ground, four carries, 20 yards. Meanwhile, Browning would at least finish the first half. Cincinnati, I don't figure to do anything. They have no timeouts to begin with. So in all likelihood, one kneel down to take us to halftime. Of course, now we'll probably throw it to 75. Touchdown pass. What do I? Guy takes his shirt off. They show him on the big screen. Crowd goes wild. It's like the Oriole chant. They spell him out. They spell out the letters. Crowd loves it. Lively spirited crowd here in Baltimore tonight. And their Ravens will go into the locker room at the half on top by a score of 21. 1-10. Right after the break, it will be the State Farm Halftime Show. Meanwhile, Burrow remains in uniform. He'll have communication here as much as he can possibly have on the sideline. The only good news for this team would be the fact that they have that mini-bye week now because of a Thursday night game, so at least Burrow will have three extra days to get ready for the next game if indeed he can play. Yeah, and for now it's focusing in on what they can do tonight to try to come back from this 11-point deficit. Really that last drive at the end of the half, great for the Ravens, able to capitalize on a couple pass interference calls, but very difficult under the circumstances. Now Jake Browning in a little bit more obvious situation with the play calling. They're going to probably stick to the guns. They've been running the football. They're going to try to probably maintain a balanced approach. If possible. Start from the 25-yard line. On the ground, a little spin move there. Mixon, this time he gets only two to the 27-yard line. Roquan Smith, number zero, making the stop. It'll be second down and eight. And I think the mindset for Roquan Smith and Patrick Queen, the linebackers, changes significantly. The threat of Joe Burrow, not just throwing, but creating. And there's just so many things that he can do. and they're going to be learning about Jake Browning as they play, what his strengths are, but in the meantime, they'll be attacking the line of scrimmage trying to stop that run game. Mixon. Another good run. Out to the 36-yard line. He goes Mixon tonight. The workhorse, 11 carries, 58 yards, caught four for 29 more. Great double team on that right side. And you see Alex Kappa and Ted Karras able to secure the double team. And, again, we just talked about those linebackers getting downhill. Those linemen are climbing and doing a good job of getting up to them. Wolves in the left guard. In the center of that time, Ted Karras. Good blocks. Go four wide here. Nixon again. Nixon takes it out to the 40 line He is a workhorse You know coming into tonight with Smaji Piran moving on and no longer part of this team he's carried 91% of the run plays for Zach Taylor in this offense. In preseason, remember, Burrow was mending the problem that he had with the cap. So, Browning did get the play. He threw 45 passes, had one touchdown pass. He was vying with Trevor Simeon for the second spot. So he does have some experience with him. Sure do. A big part of the Bengals tonight, I think, is running the football. They have struggled in that area, only 74 yards a game. That's dead last in the NFL. You cannot just be Joe Burrow and your receivers, especially with T. Higgins out again tonight. They've got to get some yardage from Joe Mixon, so that's a good start to this game. Trent Irwin also in now as a receiver. He'll see a lot of action tonight. Number 16. Burrow looks, throws, caught in the 50-yard line. Trying to spin around our first flag of the night. That's Tanner Hudson. One of their four tight ends who are active tonight. And we'll hear from Adrian Hill for the first time tonight. Face match there. First little foul, face pass, defense. Number 99. That 15-yard penalty will be added. The automatic first down. And that's the Duffy. All the way right there. He grabs a hold of that there, just trying to make that tackle. I'll tell you, Tanner Hudson's come out of nowhere these last two weeks. Ten receptions in the last couple games, and prior to that, his entire career only 15. So they've been trying to find a weapon in the interior, and he's been the go-to guy. Yeah, in our meeting with Zach Taylor the other night, He's one of the guys he talked about. Seeing more action tonight. Quick throw to the outside. It's too high and incomplete. Trying to get it to Jamar Chase. That time you had Kyle Hamilton blitzing, a guy who had a pick six early in the game on Sunday. It's second down and ten. Ravens almost dictated that reaction. You bring the blitz here, and all of a sudden Geno Stone knows, I've got to come up because Burrow's going to respond to that and get it out to Jamar Chase. So even if Chase makes that tackle, Geno Stone is there. A good call there by Mike McDonald, the defensive coordinator for the Ravens. Big Martindale here for several years. Now it's Mike. Second down and 10 from the 35. Again, this time a flip out to Tyler Boyd. He takes it to the 31-yard line. Kyle Van Noy making the tackle there. Third down. I think a lot of people are anxious to see how the Ravens decide to play Jamar Chase. You know, last week against the Texans, it protected and played a lot of double, forcing other receivers to make plays. And this place is coming alive on this third down. All it takes is an AFC North rivalry. You bring Pittsburgh in here. You bring Cleveland in here. You bring Cincinnati in here. The place goes crazy. Third and seven. A little confusion, and Burrow says, yeah, I see the confusion. Time out. And Sample and Hudson, we talked about four tight ends trying to work their way through that. And a misassignment there. Yeah, and that's a big challenge coming into this game on a short week. With an offensive line that has had some times. Last week, four sacks, nine hits on Burrow. You've got some tight ends that are being used in the backfield in pass protection. And a smart decision there to get everybody on the same page. Down to Kaylee. Guys, the Ravens tell us Mark Andrews is questionable to return with an ankle injury. He's been taken back to the locker room, but not yet to the x-ray room. We talked about what he means to this offense. Lamar Jackson threw his helmet on the ground when Mark first went down. And Odell Beckham was the last one to talk to him before he left the field. Yeah, that is, that's gigantic. Now you've got Travion Williams is in the backfield on the third and seven. All kinds of gesticulating going on on the defensive side. Heck of a play. That's experience here for Marcus Williams. 50-yard field goal attempt. Evan McPherson. To try to tack on three. And that kick is just inside the right upright. To the Bengals' answer with a field goal. halfway through the opening quarter. And the bonus bets instantly appear in your account. Like magic. Like Fitz magic. That's too much magic. It's too much magic. This week, go for two. Bet five bucks to get $150 instantly in bonus bets. Plus, a no-sweat same-game parlay every single day. The crown. On that right calf, which as we said has been an issue ever since training camp. And Jackson and company come out to the 25. Now, Lamar minus Andrews, that is a big loss. At least he has a few more weapons this year in Flowers and Beckham. History is very real and very natural with Lamar Jackson and Andrews. Isaiah likely is going to come in, and he's capable. He's a big target at 6'4". But you lose that feel. So we'll see how they're able to attack in different ways. Todd Monken, the offensive coordinator, as well as... He goes. Adrian Hill First little foul Unnecessary roughness Against the kicking team Number 43 That 15 yard penalty Is the addison Both of the play First down It's on Justice Hill Meanwhile the injury timeline On Jackson You go back a couple of years Sprained ankle week 14 He finished 0-4 Sprained PCL Missed the final five games 2-3 in 22 late season record. You take a look at this with Jackson. 12-6 in November, 14-3, December and January. So obviously I don't want to tell you how important he is to this team. Oh, yeah. Andrew's already out for the night, and hopefully we'll see number eight get back out there next time they have the football. By the way, Charlie Jones, he caught that punt in his own six-yard line, and after that return and the penalty, they're all the way out to the 42. Yeah, 56-yard punt, 20-yard return, and then the penalty. And Burrow fires, and that is Tyler Boyd. And it's incomplete as Marcus Williams is there. So Boyd, of course, is the guy, as any Bengals fan know, who last week might have won the game catching that pass in the end zone, but dropped it. Yeah, he's been one of the more reliable receivers over the last few years. But you had a couple drops, the big one there at the end of the game. And it's good to see Joe Burrow go right back to him early, especially again without T. Higgins. Boyd's going to have to have a night if the Bengals are going to compete and win this game. 2.30 left in the quarter. Through the middle. And exploiting a very narrow hole there is Joe Mixon for a Bengals first down. There you go. Get behind Orlando Brown Jr. Pulled him around. Slow developing little counter play. Watch the big man right here just pull around and lead him through. You get up to those linebackers. These linebackers attack downhill. That time he got up to Patrick Queen. And there have not been very many plays this year. Well, you've seen Joe Mixon run between the tackles and accelerate to the second and third level of a defense. Meanwhile, with Jackson in the tent, Tyler Huntley, who played a lot down the stretch last year, he begins to warm up. Here is Chase taking it, and Chase close to a first down. Around the end, he goes, tackled by Queen, first down. Yeah, run up the middle, get behind Orlando Brown Jr. Now they're working the edge, which you thought you would see Zach Taylor and Brian Callahan try to do. But, boy, if you're a Bengals fan sitting down watching this game, you're saying, boy, it's nice to see the Bengals have some ability to run the football because it takes all the pressure off of Burrow and the offensive line and pass protection. Happen to do everything. Yeah, they already have 42 ground yards on five carries. Hamilton blitzes and they get to him first before Hamilton even gets there. Tavius Robinson, he's a rookie out of Mississippi, a fourth round draft choice, takes him to the turf. Just such quickness. Lined up to the outside and then works back to the inside with that blitz from Hamilton. And just wins one-on-one. Just an ole by Volson, a left guard who's had his problems over the last couple years out of North Dakota State. That's a mismatch there on that play. Now you've got Drew Sample in the tight ends, lines up in the backfield. You've got a second down and 17. Williams back there as well, sending him out into the pattern. Pass down the right sideline is incomplete. Headed for his main man, Jamar Chase. It'll be third down and 17. Brandon Stevens covering for the Ravens. 25 seconds left in the quarter. You can understand why Burrow took that shot again. Anytime he sees Chase get isolated one-on-one, he's going to take the shot. With a safety plan in the middle of the field, he'd like the matchup. Look how he's calling those plays tonight in this atmosphere. And this place is roaring. Almost everybody standing It's third and 17 Four man rush Dumps it off underneath Drew Sample Can he get to the first down marker? Well, not even close, obviously That's the marker to start the down sequence Patrick Queen covers Meanwhile, Jackson limping back Toward the bench As the quarter winds down So he is walking it off and we will go to the second quarter as he appears for the moment. He'll go to attempt for Evan McPherson to try to make it a second. Mark Chase is there, covered by Kyle Hamilton, who is all over the place. He's the guy with the pick six on the first play from the scrimmage last week. That's one you want to be able to capitalize on. When you get a rare opportunity to get Jamar Chase one-on-one, and look at that cushion against Hamilton, that's a win. He got man-to-man to his left. They cleared out. It's a big opening. Ball actually is behind a bit. Would have been a great catch, but just unable to execute there. Third and ten. Ravens back off on the pressure, but put enough pressure on with the four who comes to take him down to the 31-yard line. And Jadavian Clowney, in his first year as a Baltimore Raven, came here and said, you know, I always wanted to play for Baltimore. Gets the sack here. He is a fantastic player, and Mike McDonald cannot say enough good things about him. But Matabike also gets a great push in the inside. That did not allow Joe Burrow to have anywhere to step up. So it was a combination of being able to have Clowney on the edge and Matabike there with a great push in the interior. Finally, 10th year in the league. Three sacks in his last two games. He was the number one overall pick 10 years ago. Meanwhile, Faircash called for May 31-yard line by Devin DuVernay with 4.10 to go in the opening quarter. 7-3 Baltimore. There it is, gang. work off that Thanksgiving dinner the next day, Friday, 3 Eastern time, noon Pacific, Black Friday. First time the NFL's played a Black Friday game. Dolphins-Jets from the 31-yard line. This drive begins with Jackson with a fullback. Ricard in the backfield. Hands the wall off to Edwards. Swings to the outside. Can he get around the corner for a couple of yards anyway? Jordan Battle is there. Second down. Kirk. It's time now for our high-performance 4K Sky Camp presented by BMW. And we've seen Trey Henry sit all over the field here early in this game. Matchup against McCary with Ronnie Stanley out here on that big third down, just using that quickness in his hands to get in there on that third down play to get the sack. Of course, don't forget, Sam Hubbard on the other side, One of the best run defenders on the edge, maybe in the entire league. That is a significant loss, not having the leadership that he provides as well. Ankle injury. Second and eight. Jackson gets away. Throws caught. Edwards taken down about four yards shy. Cam Sample put the pressure on that time. Here's Kaylee. Guys, the Ravens have ruled out Mark Andrews. He will not return to this game because of that injury to his left ankle. I watched GM Eric DaCosta deliver the news to Odell Beckham and also Rashad Bateman before this drive began with a pat on the back for each. I spoke to DaCosta and he said, we'll be okay. Keep an eye out for Isaiah Likely, the tight end behind Andrews. Yeah, we saw Isaiah Likely last year in a Baltimore-Tampa game have the night of nights. It's the third down and four. That was Aguilar in motion. Jackson scrambles away. keeps his eyes downfield and flips the ball into the bench chased that time by Logan Wilson and Jackson goes down on the sideline well Lamar down on his back and an official's timeout here hmm this place has gone silent right now flips it away. Wilson had him by the legs. Reached right away. Reached down to the lower part of his leg. Logan Wilson spied him that time. First time we've seen that on third down. Has the speed to be able to keep him from getting that first down. See, he's not feeling good right now. Yeah. So Baltimore to punt as they work on Jackson You mentioned before Trying to stay healthy He's been healthy all year Over the last two years It's been an issue Jordan Stout Second year man out of Penn State to punt it Good kick Fielded at the 8 This is Charlie Jones Who had a punt run back in week 2 Against the Ravens for a touchdown and brings it back out to the 28-yard line. And a flag comes in at the end of the play, two in fact. Meanwhile, Lamar up and walking around, but into the tent. Ravens 7-3, they're going to 8-3 tonight. Steelers Brown 6-3, and the Bengals will drop now to 5-5. I'll tell you what, you know, Baltimore loves playing in prime time. They've been great at home, especially under the lights. You put the lights on, and the Bengals melt. Do you realize this is going to be 24 losses in their last 25 primetime road games? Not good. Going back to 1998? Wow. Who was the quarterback in 1998? Do you have that one? That wasn't Jeff Blake. You're talking about four of the Bengals? We're going to look at Kelly Hayes. Ken Anderson? Go to the bowl. I know. We're just joking around here. Neil O'Donnell was the guy, I'm being told, who had come over from Pittsburgh. Yeah. And winds up in Cincinnati and leads them to a win against Philadelphia. Of course, you're thinking Neil O'Donnell with Pittsburgh. I was thinking with Tennessee. I forgot about his stop with Cincinnati. Going to have an onside kick attempt here. And it's Duvernay. So you're coming to JMU with me, huh? That's what I heard. Early flight tomorrow. So, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Kirk Herbstreit will be doing game day on ESPN at 9 o'clock Eastern time. From Charlottesville? No, Harrisonburg. Harrisonburg, Virginia, where JMU is. And then he'll be on the... Has anybody flown from Harrisonburg to Corvallis? There's a shuttle every half hour on Delta. Yeah. And then fly back home. How the hell do you do this? Crazy. This is vulnerable. Ben helps me. Yes. The pup. To the 36-yard line goes Gus Edwards. And one more play. And we can wrap it up. So you and I are seeing the same thing here, right? We like this Baltimore team. For sure. It'll be a tough out. For sure. I mean, if Jackson stays healthy, there's no question about it. You know, we'll find out about Andrews. We don't know. The security blanket, among other things. You know, the line. I mean, Ronnie Stanley will probably come back maybe in the next game or two. That helps. Marlon Humphrey will come back. Obviously, they're well coached. Yep. Come back. Come back. Come back. They love playing under the lights. Edwards. That's going to take us to the finish line. And the other side is about Joe Burrow. Like the severity, the injury. Yeah. We'll find out more tomorrow, the next couple days, I'm sure. Yeah, they had a four-game winning streak, and that was snapped last week. In an excruciating loss, there's Burrow with Jackson. A lot to find out about in the next few days. So the Ravens do what they had to do tonight. Wins stay on top in the division. There's OBJ as well. And the final score is 34-20 on Thursday Night Football. All right, so off to the Meadowlands for the Black Friday game, Jets-Dolphins. in eight days as we wrap up our coverage. But don't go anywhere because Chris and the gang will wrap things up on the JCPenney post-game show. And Gus Edwards running the ball. But, boy, Mitchell, he's 5'8", 191 pounds as we've seen. I mean, coming into tonight, four touches, over 20 yards, and only 15 on the year. So an explosive dynamic playmaker back in the back. 39-yard touchdown run last Sunday. This time Jackson keeps it. Wiggles. Takes it to the 13-yard line. First down. Well, they wanted to take the ball out of the hands of Lamar Jackson on a lot of these reads. But they collapsed down. And Lamar Jackson says, all right, I'll keep it myself. You know, still has such acceleration and quickness. So slippery in his sixth year now. They only want him when they have to. They only want him when they have to, especially down in this area. Mitchell. His dad, who's in the stadium tonight, had a, Anthony, huge takeaway in a playoff game back in the early 2000s. You know, the father plays and the kid comes in It's a cool deal It really is Living a dream Yeah The father too, the father's living a dream Second and seven Jackson Stepping away And then he just goes down Jackson in the 15-yard line. Lost his footing. Gets up hobbling. You go back to that tackle by Logan Wilson. You just wonder if he's out there playing at 100% with that ankle. You know, you very rarely see Lamar Jackson just go down. Week 11, you know any player playing at 100%? Right. How about the left foot get caught in the turf there? So back to the 15. It's the first third down play on this drive. Started back at the wrong 25. Third and 12. He'll keep. And tackled at the 8-yard line. That's Jordan Battle coming up there. And he's limping away on fourth down. They tried to go back to his legs. I like the motion. They use Mitchell. It clears out Logan Wilson. You go here, clears this out, and now you've got a chance with the numbers. This is what he brings to the table, but not being at 100%. The Bengals deserve some credit there rallying to the football with a rookie Jordan battle. Justin Tucker now. 12th year in the league. Originally signed as a free agent and a spectacular career. 25-yard attempt. per usual, with 4-0-2 remaining in the third quarter. Ravens 24. So no game next Thursday night. It's Thanksgiving, but we're with you on Friday from the Meadowlands. The Dolphins coming to town to take on the Jets. And that game will... The game starts at 3 o'clock Eastern time. All of the festivities with Carissa and the gang starting at 1.30 p.m. next week on the day we all get rid of our trip to fan hangover, right? Oh, yeah. I don't know what it's going to be like, you know, in New York. Meanwhile, well, you got, well, they play the Bills this week. That's interesting. Meanwhile, you see that left ankle wrap for Jackson on the sideline. Keep an eye on that. Touchback here. Ball coming out to the 25. This defense has been obviously at a different level when they He made this trade last year around Halloween to bring Roquan Smith over from Chicago. You can see the trades, and if you're a Bears fan, you may want to turn away losing a player like Roquan Smith. Talking about one of the top linebackers, if not the guy, the alpha in the entire NFL playing that Mike linebacker. They only allowed 15 points a game since they made that trade. Best in the league, points allowed. You look at that panel, that was a fleecing. From the 25. To the outside. Caught. And a 9-yard pickup here. Catch made by Jamar Chase. Darby takes him down, but there's a flag. Illegal formation offense. Number one covered the tight end. 5-yard pass. But can't get back even to the line of scrimmage. So it's fourth down. Manabike in on that tackle. They're trying to confuse him with different looks. Obviously showing some blitz and then dropping out. Here they have Queen walked up. He doesn't necessarily come. But they're just trying to affect the offensive line. See his eyes and how uncomfortable he is. He has nobody open. They're playing man underneath. Got a safety in the middle. You got a robber hanging down. doing everything they can to expose his inexperience at this level. So Robbins has been a busy man tonight. This is his fifth punt of the game. Fielded at the 28-yard line, Duvernay up to the 32-yard line with eight and a half to go in the fourth. Jackson coming up. On the left with Patrick McCary and Trey Hendrickson. And in the first half we showed you this, and Hendrickson was winning a lot of those battles. And as this game has started to slip through the fingers of Cincinnati, McCary is holding his own on that left side, the blind side of Lamar Jackson. Even when he gets beat, he's able to give him room to step up and then get wide for that touchdown pass right there. 8.25 left in the fourth. Starting from the 32 out of the pistol. so for Gus Edwards tonight he has now carried the ball eight times for 50 yards and of course with him you know and with what Jackson can do with his legs yeah and they got Mitchell you get three different guys with eight carries Talking about spread spreading the wealth there Second four Flag Both start often number 65 fiber penalty still second down you could buy some Take full responsibility for that. I apologize. The minute you mentioned you guys having a great night, there you go. Bingo. Upcoming schedule for the Bengals, as we mentioned, Pittsburgh at Jacksonville. Then a couple of home games. Ravens go to the Chargers to buy. Then the Rams come here. Then at Jacksonville and at San Francisco. And those games, prime time. The Chargers game coming up. Jacksonville is a prime time game. It's a good football team. They're only going to get better if they can stay healthy. Talking about Baltimore. I think it on a pretty good run got to keep number eight on his feet. Yep Going deep Open making the catch Beckham one way then the other taken down from behind Logan Wilson tracked him down and a flag is down back at the 45 yard line all the way back That's going to be declined to play a result in a first down. They're leaving D.J. Turner all night on some of these islands. He's a talented guy. Remember the Combine, this rookie year, his Combine ran a 4-2, so he's got speed. He just puts his eyes back to the quarterback and then loses Beckham. Good arm strength there by Jackson, recognizes the matchup that he wants to win. Boy, did Logan Wilson come in there with bad intentions again. But he just, that's a rookie mistake, peeking back into the backfield and man coverage and losing his man that he had. Yeah, meanwhile, Odell in some distress right there for a 51-yard game. Beckham tonight, 116 yards on four grabs. Here's Jackson inside the 10, taken down at the 8-yard line by Jordan Battle. There's been a lot of tackles tonight. Second and two. but you pull the left guard and the left tackle and then he you're going to pull here and then he's going to read this man right here Hendrickson depending on what he does he goes with the polar so he's going to get it out and again you got a safety in Dax Hill there to make the play but it's very tough for anybody to make a play on that on that pole that he makes one-on-one and he's special when he pulls that football and he has intention to get on field. I don't know very many people that can stay with him. Second and two. Justice Hill cannot get around the corner. Third down the Ravens tonight. Approaching 400 yards. They have 393 total points. They're going for it. And taking off and getting the first down and a lot more. That'll look good on the stat sheet for Browning. taking it to the 49-yard line. A gain of 19. Depending on the severity of the injury of Joe Burrow, I think Cincinnati fans are getting really their first look at obviously what Jake Browning can do unless they watched him play when he was in Washington in college. Like I said earlier, he is a very mobile, athletic guy, very comfortable throwing the football on the run and can make plays and improvise, which in today's game you have to be able to do more often than not. Block winding to the two-minute warning. That's caught, 30-yard line. Pulled in right there. Hudson making that grab, and that takes us to the two-minute break. Two-minute warning here in Baltimore. 34-13, and we'll have the JCPenney postgame show exclusively on Prime Video with Carissa and the gang. Kaylee interviewing the star of the game. Talk about Lamar. Talk about the burrow injury, fallout, and all of the rest. Here's the watch list now. What's coming up this weekend, week 11. Cowboys and Panthers early on Sunday. Dallas rolling. Jets and Bills interesting. Very interesting on a lot of counts. It's the late game Sunday. The Sunday night game Minnesota. And Denver, all of a sudden, you've got a huge story there. Denver winning the other night. Josh Dobbs on the other side. And then Eagles, Kansas City. Great match. What can you say on Monday night? Yeah. You know, everybody talking Chiefs, Eagles, maybe throw even the Dolphins, 49ers, when it comes to who's a real threat, making a run to get into the postseason, maybe get to a Super Bowl. Let's make sure we don't forget about Baltimore. I mean, Baltimore's got some games coming up that will be challenging. This is a big win for them tonight within this division against Cincinnati. They're the team everybody's going to be chasing, Pittsburgh and Cleveland. But with the way Lamar is playing right now and the weapons that he has around him, the defense that they play and their style of football, it goes into December and into January. First down, stepping out of a would-be sack, and Browning will take it. They flag down at the 18-yard line. So there's the Beckham you know you're talking about a guy lights camera action you put the lights on he loves a defense number 14 that five penalty will be added to the result of the play it it he one of those guys if it prime time or the playoffs just get ready He going to make plays The way he played the first half of the Super Bowl, Rams-Bengals, until he got hurt, I mean, he was certainly in contention to wind up as the MVP of that game. Yeah, he was on fire. How about this is his first 100-yard receiving game since the NFC Championship game at 21? Right. hurt. It took him a while to get back. After that Super Bowl, after the knee injury, first down, 12-yard line. And that pass hauled in inside the 10-yard line. And it's Irwin taking it close. Should be a first and goal. If nothing else, from a guy that hadn't played a lot, Jake Browning, You like that he's still fighting, you know. This is more than just you're down, this game's over. But you're learning about a guy, you know, as a play caller, as an offense, the players around him. Literally with every rep, you're understanding what this guy, how he's wired, what he's capable of doing. The fact that he's fighting here at the end, you love to see. He made his NFL debut earlier this season. Looking, throwing, and that's going to be caught for the touchdown by Jamar Chase. So all of a sudden, you know, we know it's the end of the game. It's 75 yards, eight plays in 340. And again, I think his teammates are earning some respect from him. And this is all about timing. Anytime you throw this back shoulder like this, he's going to sell the fade and then come back. Ball's already in the air. And that's because you've got to put it to a spot and have your receiver work back to it. And we know Jamar Chase can do that with Joe Burrow with his eyes closed, but here he shows he can do it with a backup quarterback in Browning as well. McPherson, four point number 20. So make it 34 to 20. So the standings will look like this. So there goes that catch. Still the first down. take a look at Roquan Smith and look at the numbers before and then after this trade. It says it all. I mean, every single category you want to look at, they're up near the top. And, you know, what he does is he also, besides being a great player, he communicates. He's just that guy that gets everybody right. And I think he's helped Patrick Queen a lot. Little Ray Lewis 2.0. Dancing and darting and unable to escape. sack enough at Owe with that sack he locked in that time on Jamar Chase then he's looking to his right he comes back and tries to find Irv Smith by the time he looks right by the time he tries to find his check down he's in no man's land Owe just continues to get better and better a little raw as a rookie out of Penn State now in his third year look at all these pass rushers They got a lot of guys that get after the quarterback. I think Browning was saying, oh, they're second and 22. Draw play. Up to the 19, Rabion Williams to Kaylee. Guys, as you were talking about, the linebacker position in Baltimore will always be revered. And Roquan Smith told me he was studying Ray Lewis' film long before he became a Raven. First, as a kid, he was searching NFL bigots hits on YouTube. But also, he was watching Lewis' motivational speeches. So when he walked into the first team meeting here last year, he told the room. He knew the standard. He wanted to meet it and exceed it. Kyle Hamilton told me Smith is now the heart and soul of this team, guys. Yeah, we just saw Ray in the shadows upstairs. Third and 17 now. Under pressure. Going deep. And it's Chase. Can he make the catch along the sideline? And at the 45-yard line, Jamar Chase cannot pull it in. He can't bring it down, but I'll tell you. That was close. Jake Browning just threw this up in the air and said, you're better. Just go up and get it. He keeps it inbounds. The ball inbounds. The feet are not. But gave him a chance. Why not? I don't blame him. You're an inexperienced guy, even with a safety coming over there to double him. Still throw it up there to him. Years ago, there was a force out on plays like that. You get forced out of bounds, but that's a long gun. Robbins to punt. Wobbly kick. Fair catch goal for a made 44-yard line by Duvernay. Been a bit of a war of attrition. Mark Andrews out. Ankle injury first quarter. Joe Burrow out. Second quarter wrist. Still in uniform on the sideline communicating right now. Meanwhile, Lamar Jackson had his problems tonight. Going down early. Going down on the last drive. but still none the worse easy for us to say as he takes over from the 44 yard line back is Mitchell give it to Keaton Mitchell with great speed and shifty moves and all the rest to the 35 yard line and that's what he's been doing and the crowd loves it He's become a sudden star here. Yeah, and they continue to work that right side without Sam Hubbard, who's such a great run defender. He cuts back just trying to run to space. You get a guy like this who's got such quickness. The safeties, I think, look at him on film, and they really don't understand how quick and sudden he is until they see him in person, and there's his dad. Wants to see him get more touches, and he's getting them tonight. Yeah, the Super Bowl ring from that 2000 season. fake give, pass caught turns it into a decent game Zay Flowers about 4 yards shy of the first back we go to Kaylee guys, between drives on the sidelines Lamar Jackson had a moist heating pad wrapped around that left ankle that allowed him to rest his legs but keep that ankle loose and warm he seems to be moving around better now than he was when he came off the field for the last drive, that's for sure yeah, no question about that it's second down and four again talking about missing so much time in each of the last two seasons and what that's meant to the team. So important, obviously, to keep them healthy. Second and four from the 29-yard line. Has time. Goes deep, and it's incomplete in the end zone. That's Odell Beckham again. Crowd, of course, every time you see something like that, they want a flag. Don't get it. Wougier covering on the play. Again, they're taking these shots. They want to get the ball. This is where you get really tested. Any quarterback gets tested down in this low red area, but especially a guy that doesn't have a ton of reps. You've got to make such a quick decision and get the ball out. You've got to trust your eyes, find the matchup that you like, and try to win. They don't have to score here. Third down and five. But they'd sure like to. Third and five. They send everybody the Ravens do, and that pass is Irvin holding onto it, but they're going to call it incomplete. And make it fourth down, and in comes the field goal unit. There's Ronald Darby, who's in for Marlon Humphrey, a veteran guy who's been around for a number of years, nine years. Gets it done with quickness. That time he had his eyes on the ball, got his right hand on it to knock it away quickly from Irvin. Darby's been around eighth year in the league replacing Marlon Humphrey now in the starting group McPherson now for the chip shot field goal of 26 yards and they're back coaching staff helping out Joe Burrow helping out pretty Impressive, though. Back in the drive. Yeah. Resulting in three points. Meanwhile, you go back to that Bengals job. The Mangals defense. See, you had two questionable. That's third and ten right there. That's a questionable call. This is a phantom call. I'm not sure how they called this one on Turner. I don't see any contact there at all. But give the Ravens credit. They capitalized. Bateman ends up getting away from coverage, and they get that touchdown right before the half. Yeah, those are the Bengals who have the fewest penalties in the league, averaging 4.6 and 48 penalties in that first half for 73 yards. So the Ravens now from the 25-yard line. Give it to Edwards. Nice move. Touch it back. And again a 25. Tackled by Battle. Great move, slipping to his right, and off he goes. This is why you just never know on the outside stretch play. Watch this block on the backside by Ricard, 300-pound fullback, and just a vision. You know, you look at Edwards, you think he's power. You know, you lose J.K. Dobbins, he's a great back again to the Achilles. And Edwards brings power, but as you see there, he brings vision and quickness to be able to cut that all the way back to the right. from the 49. Five carries. 33 yards for him. Deep drop. Jackson stepping up. Throws wide open. And that's another first down in the game to 14 to Charlie Kolar. To Kaylee. What you got, Kaylee? Guys, the Bengals have now officially declared Joe Burrow out for the game and a hit to the defense as well. Cam Taylor Britt, the cornerback who leads the team in interceptions, He's been ruled out with a quad injury on the left side. We saw him limping off the field late in the first half, and now he doesn't look mobile on the sideline. Thank you, Katie. Again, a six here. And second down. You know, the Bengals, we mentioned the mini-bye. When you play a Thursday game, you're going to play until the following Sunday, the week from. The next game is at home against Pittsburgh. Yeah, and you want to see, if you're Zach Taylor, how your team responds. I mean, you can imagine. You lose your guy. That's a punch to the gut. And it's one thing to have Burrow limping around those first three or four weeks, but he was out there. Now he's gone. See how you respond. Because that can impact not just the offense, but even the defense. Second and three. Edwards again. And he gets the first down. You know, when the season started with, you had Gus. You had J.K. Dobbins. You mentioned Dobbins, Achilles, opening day. By the way, J.K. Dom is working very religiously in terms of his rehab. Doing very well. You're checking up on all the guys out there, right? See them every week. I go to rehab. I see the entire injured reserve list of the NFL. J.K. doing very, very well. Yeah. He needs to catch a break. He's had the ACL in 21. Yeah. Now dealing with this this year. Two years in a row. From the 25-yard line. puts it to the outside that's caught about a 9 yard gain that time to Keaton Mitchell speedy rookie 3-8 out of East Carolina whose dad played for this team two decades ago this brings a different element to the offense you get caught up in Zay Flowers when Andrews of course is healthy about Jamar Chase and how much press he has faced throughout the season and you see 73 routes. That's the most in the NFL. And even against the Ravens, week two, you go back, you had eight routes against press, only one target tonight, eight routes also against press. What doesn't show up there is how often in these press plays that he faces, how many times they have a safety over top. Very rarely we see him pressed and left on an island because he usually will win that matchup every time. So while they figure out what's going to happen here with the drone that is creating this stoppage, tell you that Cincinnati, we mentioned, don't have to play again for 10 days. Then they've got Pittsburgh. Then they go to Jacksonville and Indianapolis and Minnesota. after that. Adrian Hill will now bring the teams back out onto the field. And for Baltimore, up next they go to the Chargers, then a bye, then the Rams come here, then at Jacksonville at San Francisco. Miami and Pittsburgh ain't easy. Well, I know Jake Browning is when they make adjustments on the sideline, it's about handling pressure. The Ravens only blitzed for 12% of his dropbacks. And against Browning, it's close to 40% of his dropbacks. You can see him walked up again here. So second down and 10. Flips it to the outside. That's caught there by Tanner Hudson. Really good job of pre- to post-snap look there by Mike McDonald with an inexperienced quarterback. With Burrow down, they show that blitz, and then they drop out of it. And he's got to play to try to beat man coverage. He's flipping it out to his tight end, but they dropped out of the man, sat in zone, and really easy to just rally to the football there on that out cut there by the Hudson. Third and eight. fires into traffic, incomplete. Covered well, trying to get it into Boyd, and that's Kyle Hamilton, their number one pick last year out of Notre Dame, has been terrific this year, fourth down. It's a game of inches when it comes to completing on third down, and it's more ball placement. This ball out here gives you a chance. He puts it to the inside, and that's what allows Hamilton to knock that ball away. Robbins to kick. Fair catch, 34-yard line by DuVernay. A little Thursday night football talk. AFC East, Miami-Buffalo, the Jets, and New England. 0-7 record over the last two weeks. quite in contrast to the AFC North. Last week, six games ended on a field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter. Deshaun Watson, of course, out for the season. Shoulder injury, devastating blow for the Browns. And the Bills firing offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey on Tuesday after the Monday night game. Somebody probably had to pay the price in Buffalo. Dorsey was the guy from the 35-yard line. Five-yard game here for Keaton Mitchell. What a different week for Mitchell, right? I mean, after the game last week against the Browns, there were a lot of fans, some of the media questioning John Harbaugh of why in the world is Keaton Mitchell not getting his hands on the ball. And he said, hey, listen, we want to get his hands on the ball more. We want to get it to Mark Andrews more. And that's going to be something that we emphasize. And, of course, Andrews went down with that injury. before they're trying to find ways to get 34 the football this game. Looking for room. Stop. Two yards shy. Mitchell again. Logan Wilson's there third down. You mentioned John Harbaugh. I mean, 16 years. Think about this. He came in same time that Tomlin went to Pittsburgh. Look at these two organizations and how solid and consistent they have been. So good. third and two going quickly here trying to pick up the first and do give it to him again to the 48 yard line I loved when we talked to him about this just a brand of Ravens football and he said listen this was here before I got here you know they just hired a no name like me was his direct quote just kind of self deprecating of course he had a great career you know now he's become very well known here in Baltimore but I think all of us as football fans whether you're a fan of the Ravens or not, you just kind of marvel going back to Ozzie, Newsome, and what this organization and how consistent they've been able to be over the years. Jackson. We're talking about being a Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Tomlin actually came in one year before Harbaugh when Tomlin's second year, all he did was win the Super Bowl. Ozzie Newsome, of course, was the general manager. Eric DeCosta has taken over, but Ozzie still has his fine hand in the organization. Here's a guy who is drafted about as well as anybody. Anybody. And I think not only do they find guys that fit them physically, athletically, especially on defense, but they find the right fit. They find a personality in a guy that fits their DNA. That's why they lose great players, lose great coaches, and they replace them. Second and two. And flag is thrown. You see that coming in from behind. Mitchell, for the moment, would have a first down, but... I think you're going to get Simpson again. It'll be his second holding call. Holding, offense, number 76. Ten-yard penalty, replay, second battle. He's surprised by the blitz by Jordan Battle. Just gets off balance to his left right there. Right away, he knew. Yep. Well, things relatively placid for John Harbaugh these days. But for brother Jim? He's got a lot going on. That's all they accepted, the three-game suspension today. Just broke this afternoon. So he won't coach Saturday against Maryland or next week against Ohio State. Michigan, Michigan, gosh. Second and 12. Jackson. Going to fake. Going to take off. Going to go down at the 48-yard line. Again, losing his footing. And trying to go quickly here on third down. I think he may have slipped on this one. It's definitely not at 100% with that left ankle. But, yeah, he's having an issue with his footing on some of these cuts. Going a little huddle. Third down and six. And that pass is incomplete. So that's Isaiah likely. He's going to see a ton of action, of course, until Mark Andrews is able to return. Not tonight, but hopefully in ten days. Fourth down. Cy that time got home. Got to show how physical he can be. He's really no more for his quickness. That time just pushed McCary right into the backfield, right into the quarterback. Jordan Stout he'll punt Charlie Jones back inside the 10 yard line for the possible run back Jones is going to let it bounce and it skids into the end zone 10 and a half to go in the fourth quarter in Baltimore from the 20 yard line on first down. Three-yard pickup here. So we've got Tua going up against the Jets. The Jets, you know, not playing particularly well, but somehow hanging in there. Yeah. You know, Aaron Rodgers, who knows? Can he come back? Nobody seems to know at this point he hopes to be able to. Yeah. He's progressing very well. Are you still seeing him in the... I totally see the entire... Yeah. I mean, what's your breakdown on Aaron? I have no scoop. No, you have no scoop. Not yet. Second down and seven. I know he'd like to, but a lot of things in play. To the outside goes that pass. And Mixon picks up a couple. It's amazing how many of these teams are just trying to get by with just playing great defense. You know, just trying to hold up, whether it's been an injury or the offense is just lacking production. We're in an interesting time right now with the NFL. Well, you know, there's 12 or 13 teams that have quarterbacks and offenses that they feel that that's the identity they want to be. And you have another, I don't know, about 20. They're trying to find it. Third down and five. Backing up, buying time, taking off. Two yards against that Cincinnati defense that was shredded last Sunday. Yeah. Yeah, and I looked at my board from last year when we were down at Tampa doing Baltimore Tampa. They had a lot of injuries. But to look at how Lamar Jackson is now back with Gus Edwards, his rookie Keaton Mitchell, Odell Beckham comes in, the rookie Zay Flowers, Nelson Aguilar comes over, free agent from New England. You already, you know, of course, Mark Andrews is down now with an injury. Bateman, I know he gets a lot of attention. He's got a lot of help now. They did a heck of a job of building around him with a lot of speed. And a new offensive coordinator in Tom Munkin. Meanwhile, here's Edwards sending up a first down and goal. It's interesting. I mean, Greg Roman was here for a lot of years, had a lot of success. But then all of a sudden, you know, it was time, according to John Harbaugh, to make that change. So he brings in there's Todd, who, of course, you know very well from his days in college football. Yeah, he won back-to-back national championships with Kirby Smart and the Georgia Bulldogs and got the opportunity when they moved on from Greg Roman. Actually, pretty similar scheme. I just feel like it's a little bit more balanced, and he has more weapons. So it's a little bit more diverse than I think what it's been in the last couple years. And it's not just because of Todd Munkin. I think it's because of some of the additions that I mentioned out on the perimeter. First down goal play clock at one. They get it off. And into the end zone goes Edwards for the touchdown. And that'll put the exclamation point on this baby. Six plays, 68 yards in three and a half minutes. Like I said, when you lose Joe Burrow, it's not just going to impact Jake Browning in the offense. I think it took the wind out of the sails of the Cincinnati team when Burrow went down. The Ravens ran the football for 30 yards in the first half. The second half, 123 yards. So really wearing down and just taking the will away from Cincinnati in this second half. Tucker for the point after. So the Ravens on the cusp of moving three games in front of Cincinnati. and trying to go to 8-0 on Thursday night under John Harbaugh. 34-13. Go. I got you. Of course. We're watching that every week. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats power by AWS. Yards after the catch. Boy, it's good to see number three healthy. Goes over 100 yards tonight. By the way, first time since the 2021 NFC Championship game that he's been able to get over 100 yards. It's been a lot of different receivers, but this Ravens offense, if you sit back and you get concerned, you better be able to tackle them in space. And tonight, Cincinnati has struggled to do that. First down. Again, we have a couple here from Mixon. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Odell Beckham Jr. is in the x-ray room now with the team's orthopedist. He left the field grabbing his left shoulder, though we haven't gotten an injury designation from the team yet. He already wears a harness on that left shoulder. He was on the injury report week 8-9 because of it. So there he is. He's walking off. Logan Wilson was in on that tackle. That's the hat trick for him. Second down at 8. Not that he means any malice. He's just having to be in on all three tackles. And there's a smothering sack by Kyle Van Nooy. And tonight for the Ravens, it's going to be a total of five sacks. We talked about a BK before who now has at least a half a sack in eight straight games and a full sack in six straight. How do the Ravens find guys like Kyle Van Nooy, Jadavion Clowney, James Houston last year, JPP last year? They find those veterans that come in and be good pieces to be able to apply pressure. Mike McDonald taking advantage of that. They lead the NFL in sacks. They're up to 44 now in the year. Yeah. Third and 18. Nice little run here out to the 32-yard line for Travion Williams. Yeah, you mentioned Van Noy and Clowney each in their 10th year. I mean, both guys have been around and found a new home here. Yeah, and it's terrific when you can bring in a guy like Van Noy, who's got the two Super Bowl championships with New England. Jadavion Clowney has been through so much in his career. And so I think it's really smart to not just bring in what they bring to the table, but they also help set the tone, you know, from a preparation standpoint, getting the team, the younger players ready and understand what it takes. Fourth and three, so what are you about to lose at this point? The ball to Odell Beckham, a little stutter, a little move to the inside. He's really just an option route. any way he can get downfield and win on a go ball. Fischel right there. Good no call. Nice to see one of those tonight, right? Third and four. Final minute of the third. This time only a three-man rush. Eight back. Dancing away. Buy-in time. Under pressure. Nearly gets sacked. Has time. Going to the end zone. And is out of bounds. He bought all that time. And Zay Flowers was able to get there. Meanwhile, you got a Bengaloos down. He got chased. They had a three-man rush. But he was out of bounds. It's fourth down. Meanwhile, you got that's Turner, DJ Turner, who's shaking up. Let's see. This is going to be one Mississippi, two Mississippi. This is the beauty of when you rush three. and you got Lamar Jackson back there. You really have no chance, even though you get in. That was D.J. Reeder. I love how he keeps his eyes down field. Look at his throw, by the way. Almost 11 seconds. Good luck. That's tough on D.J. Turner, who went down. Maybe he was just exhausted from trying to plaster that long against a scramble. Turner gets up. He walks along the sideline. And they've got Tucker in here for a 47-yard field goal attempt. Of course, everything is in range for him, including Annapolis. Easy pickings. 26 seconds remaining in the third. Back in 30 seconds. Talk about I'm a knucklehead Big boy in bed Maybe I'm a nerd with a deviant Maybe I got time and I'll let it go I'll tell you mine I ain't got no brain Back at M&T Bank Stadium. Such a thing as a perfect night for football. This is at 53 degrees, clear skies. We come on the air. It's a great night for whatever it is. 30 degrees, snowing. 68 degrees, but tonight's the perfect night. Yeah, I'm shocked. When we looked at this one at the beginning of the season, I thought middle of November is going to be a little chilly in Baltimore. This is ideal. Trying to convince Mark Teileman, our producer, that we could come on and tank tops tonight with no avail. I know one guy who would love that. Of course. Our boy McAfee. And not me. Yeah, there you go. I'm with you. in this division, the AFC North. All the teams over 500 coming in tonight with the Ravens on top. There's Watt. There's Garrett. Of course, Burrow and Cincinnati. You go to Week 18, Pittsburgh will be here and Cleveland will be at Cincinnati as this one figures to go down to the wire. And you could see three teams getting into the playoffs. Pretty amazing that Pittsburgh keeps finding ways to win games. Tremendous. We'll see him in a couple of weeks against New England and Pittsburgh on a Thursday night. Meanwhile, first down here. And Nixon stopped near the line of scrimmage. As the seconds wind down in the third. That's what we've not seen from these linebackers. And, again, I don't think they feel threatened right now by Browning. They're blitzing him a lot, and now those backers are really getting downhill in a hurry against that run game. And I think we have another drone that has worked its way into the stadium. So we have what they call an administrative timeout. Frustrating for everybody, obviously. and that's why we have the teams going back to the respective sidelines and trying to figure out what's going on here well we know what's going on trying to figure out how to remedy the situation while we're waiting Kurt listen all right let's take a look while we have this break at our next year the stats powered by AWS and it's
