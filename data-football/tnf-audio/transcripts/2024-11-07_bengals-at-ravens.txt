 3rd and 15, quick throw, Flowers, looks for room, breaks a couple of tackles, but they have a long way to go, and he's about six yards shy. Battle makes that tackle, 4th and 6th. This defense is flying around tonight. Cincinnati came into this game, the defense has not been a strength. We talked about in the open, how did the Bengals win this game? We said, let's be honest, how many stops are they going to get on Lamar Jackson? They're probably going to have to outscore him. Defense only giving up that one touchdown so far in the first half, playing great. Jordan Stout to punt. Trenton Irwin sets up inside the 35. High floating kick. 34. Irwin looking for some room. There is none. And winds up losing a few on the play. So back come the Bengals on offense with Burrow and company. And we're back in 30 seconds. Cincinnati taking over. You know, with the Bengals, they're taking care of the bottom feeders. They're 8-28 in their four wins. The teams are 8-28. But then against teams that have winning records, very tough. Here comes Chase Brown for a gain of about four. Again, going back to the earlier part of the show tonight, I think that they sense that. They sense an opportunity to beat one of the top teams in the league on the road on a short week, coming off a win against the Raiders after a slow start once again. But here they are at 4-5, chance to get to 500, chance to get 2-1 within a division. They're playing with a bit of an edge tonight on the road here on this short week. Second and seven. Burrow. Tip. And incomplete. That's on Kyle Hamilton. Again, this guy plays all over the place. He sort of reminds you of the way Troy Polamano played with Pittsburgh. You never know where he's going to line up. And what's different is he's 6'4". I mean, with that kind of length and that kind of ability to explode into the backfield, that's a nice job of kind of disguising that. Joe Burrow's trying to find the football. Disguises it. Lines up against the tight end. Joe is fooled. But there's that length. helping him out, be able to knock that football down. Third and seven. Straight drop. Comes out. Going to run it and going to be taken down just shy of the first down. Owe and Roquan Smith are there, so they're just shy of the 40. It's going to be fourth down and inches. He's not blinking. He's sending in to tie it in. He's bringing in Chase Brown. Remember, just their last series, they were pretty close to the same spot on the field, but maybe about another yard to go. This time with a half a yard to go, he's sending out the offense. It's the fourth time they've gone for it here on fourth down. Yeah, do they really go for it or just try to draw them offside? That's always the case in a situation like this. Play clock at 5. And meanwhile, snapped it. To Tanner Hudson who went motion. Officials coming to the line. Judge takes a look at it. And. Wow. Yep. How about that? A little bit. Wouldn't you say that's risky? I mean, I know you practiced that, right? But the timing. I love what Joe Burrow does. Watch how Joe Burrow communicates over to the offensive sideline. He said, oh, is that the call? And then the ball is snapped. Yeah. To Hudson trying to get the defense to just kind of fall asleep just for a bit. A bit. Good snap by Karras. There it is again. Another look. So they gamble. They go for it. Get it. First down. Burrow retreats. Little floater here. And nothing to do with a Brownie. No chance. Coverage by Marcus Williams. They're playing zone here, and their eyes are right where they need to be. You said Marcus Williams. Watch him in position. Off the fake. Doesn't get fooled. A little half roll. Blitz Trenton-Sempson, but Williams sniffed that out the entire time. So after that first down, after going for it on fourth down, now the Bengals go backwards. Second and 15. Six and a half left in the half. Drop. 40-yard line. That's Tanner Hudson. So two plays ago, he's the big hero. And then a couple of plays later, he drops an easy throw. This year catches the ball out of the backfield. He had five catches, 37 yards, and a touchdown last week to go along with those rushing yards. But he can't keep taking a pounding. I think that's why you saw Herbert get signed with that injury to Moss. Herbert in a deal with the Bears. Meanwhile, Burroughs steps up, throws. That's a first down. And that's Brown again. scored the touchdown earlier. We're just joining us. Cincinnati marched down the field. Went 70 yards. Ravens went three and out. So it was 645. The entire quarter has been controlled by Cincinnati. There's a look at Herbert coming over from Chicago. Had an injury. Wasn't used a whole lot. DeAndre Swift came over to help the Bears, and Herbert was on the bench for the most part. So he will get maybe more of an opportunity here at Cincinnati. Brown again. Good run again. And a flag is that. Flag down back at the 36-yard line. That's a hold on Teddy Karras to center. When he'll come back. Holding. Offense. Number 64. Finger up in lane. He played first down. He's trying to make a reach block. Tough to do on Tupo. and he's working to his left. He tries to just get out in front and then just ends up pulling him down. There he is right here. Just ends up pulling him down. See, he's off to that left gap. Gets his hands up. Brings the big man down. Bengals, one of the best in the league at avoiding penalties. Only 37 yards per game. Second best in the NFL. First and 20. Burrow to the outside. That's caught. Breaking a tackle. Picking up a couple of extra yards and getting about nine. Is Gusecki setting up a second down and 11 for the Bengals. I think you'll see more and more of that with Gusecki up on the line of scrimmage and Jamar Chase kind of stacked behind him. It puts the defense in a bind. And if you free up Jamar Chase to give him option routes depending on the coverage, that's an area this year that Dan Pitcher, the offensive coordinator for Cincinnati, He's put a lot more on Jamar Chase, moving him around, giving him freedom at the line of scrimmage instead of just being stationary at one spot, and he's really taken off with that. It's a secondary that's tough, that has not been tough, as Tanner Hudson makes the catch. It's a secondary that's been exploited this year. Again, we go back to number one against the rush, dead last against the pass. You almost never see that combination. No, not at all. And I think it's a little bit of a combination. Teams don't try to run on them a lot, so you're not going to get a lot of production. They're really stout in the middle with that interior. Roquan Smith always patrolling the interior as well, so I think the answer is tough sledding up front to try to get that short passing game against these linebackers in zone coverage. Bengals running their 19th play. Pressure again. Brown makes a nice block, and Chase makes the catch along the sideline. So they go from first and 20 to third and two to a first down. It's a tough ask for any running back when you have a linebacker like Roquan Smith who's going to be able to come up on his splits clean. But look at the job Chase Brown does. Pushes him out, and then you just knew when you saw the motion and Jamar Chase got matched up against Stevens that Joe Burrow was going right there on third and short. There's the chemistry between 9 and 1. Seems like every single time he dials him up. Burrow's already thrown 14 passes. Completed 9. Under 4 to play in the quarter. Brown again. And Brown to the 40-yard line. So, Chase in his second year out of Illinois. Picked him in the fifth round last year. And again, Joe Mixon was the guy. And then Brown was there. And then we talked about Brown. and Moss was going to be probably 1 and Brown was going to be 1A, but now he's got to be 1. Yeah, and I think he's taken off with it. Not just a big game last week, but you can see it even tonight. Lamar Jackson waiting for his opportunity. He hadn't had much at all, minute 29 out on the field. And this kid runs hard. He's 210 pounds, has great vision, nice acceleration as well. Second down and three. Play fake. Pass. And going down as the pass got to him, Yosevich can't hold that one in. It'll be third down and three. I don't know what happens to Cincinnati and Joe Burrow when they get to November, but there's just a different look in his eyes. There's a different look in the huddle. There's a different look at the urgency. I mean, Joe looks like he is in that zone. We saw it in college at LSU when he won the Heisman in the national title in 2019. You didn't see that same laser focus. We saw it, of course, last week. And, man, you can see it on display tonight. They need to bring that to September because historically they've been getting off to bad starts. Burrow escapes, throws, and that's included on the sideline there. And, again, looking for a flag. Doesn't get one. Hamilton covering on the play. The second being intended receiver, fourth down to three. Van Noy made him step up. They're getting pressure with four. He's out here, and again, that's a great matchup against Mims, the rookie. Makes him step up, which Joe's done a lot of, just kind of climbing in that pocket. There's Hamilton. Boy, Kyle Hamilton does everything for this defense. All over the place. He flashes every time you see him. Meanwhile, from the 41, they made a fourth down for a touchdown earlier. Now they go for a fourth and three. Kappa looking back. Burrow, deep drop. Burrow down the sideline, and that's incomplete. The coverage is good. Pressure was put on. Burton, the intended receiver, and they hand the ball back to the Ravens at the 41-yard line. 2.56 left in the quarter. 7-0 Cincinnati. One to win it. You tease me about my schedule. I usually go to those Bengals home games. went to that game. Cincinnati had controlled that game in the second half for the most part. Ten-point lead, under six to play. Meanwhile, you've got... Ball start, offense number 77. Five-yard penalty. Go first down. Daniel Fa'alele. Let's take a look while we have a chance to take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS and Derrick Henry having a career year. A lot of people wondered if he still had the goods. Look at what he's done as far as forcing those missed tackles. 60 at second in the entire league. And look at them as a team, 124. Consequently, they lead the league in yards after contact as well. Henry will be 31 before the end of the season. Give it to him. Bunch him up. It's funny because he was out there, wanted to leave Tennessee. We were talking to John Harbaugh the other day. Who are you competing with? And he said, we don't even know. He said, I think a lot of teams felt that $8 million a year was too much for a running back, which is hard to believe in today's NFL. With the salary cap and what it is. And then, of course, the Cowboy fans are crazed that they didn't pick him up. Second down and 11. Jackson throws. Reaching up, making the grab there is Mark Andrews. So Andrews, the victim of a hip-druck tackle in this game last year, missed the rest of the season. watching him before the game tonight looks better than ever. Yeah, it's great to see him healthy. What a matchup here against the safety Jordan Battle. Able to kind of take that up and then across against man coverage. But how about Lamar Jackson? Very comfortable, moves away from the pressure, and look at the touch that he's throwing this football with. It's not just throwing it with everything he has. Nice touch there to put that right on the money to the big tight end. From the 43, that pass is incomplete. out of the reach of Flowers. It'll be second down and 10. You know, watching Andrews before the game, he was practicing that catch, you know, for half an hour. I saw that. And with serious intent. I was down there watching that same thing you're talking about. And I think with Lamar, I mean, look at the pieces around him. You know, I think the reason he's having another MVP year, seventh year out of Louisville, is Andrews is healthy. Rashad Bateman's healthy. Zay Flowers now in his second year really coming along. Derek Henry gets a lot of the attention, but they are so much better on the edge. Second down and 10. Jackson. Out of the pocket. Always dangerous. Proves it again. First down. Think you have him and you don't. Goes to the side. Able to run him down. So he's in trouble. He scrambles out of the pocket and picks up 12 yards in the first. Yeah, you're in no man's land when he gets back on that shotgun and you don't get pressure and he's able to get out of there. Now you're a defensive back. You're supposed to plaster the receiver but give him room. What are you going to do? He's going to make you pay either way. You let him out the side door. Stopped in the line of scrimmage. That's Keaton Mitchell. So Mitchell is a guy who's been hurt. Flag is thrown. Activate Mitchell tonight. His first action of the season got hurt last year. Knee injury. Shelved him. Here's Blakeman. I think they got him on a 12th man. Pratt didn't get off. Hill took a hit last week. Some people wondered how much he'd be able to play. Look at him use the hands, get off of the block from the rookie, Rosengarden, and makes that play in the backfield. What a job on a third and four by the interior of this Bengals defense. So the Bengals control it for almost six minutes, and the Ravens have a three it out. Jordan Stout. A little punt down to Trenton Irwin, who drifts over and secures it out of bounds at around the 10-yard line. Pretty amazing if you think about it. Here we are, you and I and our whole crew. Last year at this time, very close, almost the same week in the season, Joe Burrow had that injury. He makes this throw to Joe Mixon. It's the wrist, the right wrist. Right after that throw, he goes over to the sideline, tries to work it out. And I think really after the first throw, didn't he make the throw? He just said, that's it. I'm done. Had surgery in the offseason. Worked diligently to try to get himself back. You could see how frustrated he was. And he's put himself in a spot, as he said to us this week, I'm playing the best football of my career. And here he is back in Baltimore a year later. Not only was he out of that game, he was out for the rest of the season. And he gets hit from behind. That time, Owey. Adopi Owey. Knocks him down. As he releases second down and 10. Here's a matchup. Cody Ford is in for Orlando Brown. They decided today to keep Orlando Brown down. Look at that hop, jump, skip, and the speed off the edge. If you're a Ravens fan, you want to see that more often. That's what Owey was supposed to be, that guy off the edge. They've been looking for it. That time he delivers against that backup left tackle, Cody Ford. So the Ravens getting a decent pass rush. Burrow out of the pocket in goal to go situations get him out of the pocket again signals downfield throws and is lucky that wasn't picked at the 20 yard line Darius Washington who actually had an interception in last week's game here couldn't hang on his third and ten pressure again off the edge but Burrow does a pretty good job here just trying to keep this play alive what I like about Burrow is watch the hand gesture He tries to move people, trying to get somebody to help him out. There aren't a lot of receivers over there. Kosicki moves late. And even though he has a size advantage, 6-6 against 5-8, quickness there wins with Washington in coverage. Third and 10. Bengals are still on the huddle now. They will take a timeout. This is the first timeout. It's going to be a 30-second timeout. 30-second timeout here. And let's go to Kaylee. Well, guys, in a year later, Joe Burrow says this is the best he's felt since he tore that ligament in his right wrist here in Baltimore, like you guys were talking about. He told us the scar tissue continues to break down, and he's getting more and more range of motion. And if you watch him closely when he's on the sidelines, you can see the moments where he's instinctually moving it around to try to keep that wrist loose. So far, so good. and again comes into this game with a 5-1 touchdown to interception ratio, which is phenomenal. Third and ten. Pressure. Extra pressure. Fires too high. Chase is there. Chase wants a flag. And Chase, there is a flag. It's the rookie, Nate Wiggins. Risky to leave a rookie out there with Jamar Chase on an island. It's one thing to cover him. But the reason Burrow misses Chase is because on his out cut, he gets held. Look how close he still came to completing that. He's how frustrated Jamar Chase is, but he gets the call. Yeah, Wiggins was their number one draft pick out of Clemson. so the fourth down defensive holding called it give them a chance to punch in a touchdown and now pin back deep in their own territory and they get the interference to again on a third down they pick up the first down missed opportunity for John Harbaugh now defense twice crowd didn't like it it's the home of the fable manure chant which we've heard in the past Brown to the 30-yard line. So they had Zach Moss, got him from Indiana. But remember, they let Joe Mixon out the door now with Houston. Brought in Moss, but he's now hurt, and he's on injured reserve. So Brown has become the guy, and they just signed Khalil Herbert from Chicago. He's been in camp for a couple of days. Chase Brown's been really impressed. So the Ravens will get the ball as we start the second half. opening game week 10 touchback moments ago Kaylee with John Harbaugh well coach Cincinnati controlled the ball how do you get them off the field well we got to get off the field on third down for sure a little too much Joe scrambling that's been the bottom line we got to keep him in there and get him in the pocket your offense only had one drive longer than four plays how do you sustain them well first drive of series has been hurting us we got to get some yards in the first drive of the series thanks interesting because last week they scored on the Ravens on seven consecutive drives tonight a different story meanwhile they've taken good care of the Bengals defense of Henry this was going to be a seventh carry instead it's Jackson slides to a stop after a game of five and a flag is down Blakeman is our referee holding offense number 77 10 yard penalty First out. Daniel Baalele. That's a frustrating holding call, obviously, not just to start the half, but it was unnecessary. Lamar Jackson was already away from B.J. Hill and the big fella. By the way, he's 410 pounds, played tackle in college in Minnesota now as a guard. You can see, I mean, B.J. Hill's not even rushing. Basically giving up on the play, and he grabs a hold of that jersey. 410, though, they list him at 380. I believe you. First and 20. Under pressure. Gets away. Surveying. Running it. There he goes. He gets back to the 20-yard line after all that. That's being a one. I mean, when he came outside of B.J. Hill, I thought, you know, a healthy Lamar Jackson takes off and gets some yards. But, you know, he is not running the ball as much. these last couple weeks. There's yards there to take. He kind of slow plays at weights. Good job of plastering back on the backside of that defense by the Bengals. Anytime Lamar Jackson gets out there, he takes that off right now. Get down that right sideline. Huge yards. But instead, maybe that tells you a little bit about his health and what he might be dealing with. Yeah, runs about 35 to get one. Second and 19. Good protection. Fires, and then the receiver falls down. So that time, Deontay Johnson, a couple of years ago, he's the number one receiver in Pittsburgh, goes to Carolina, can't wait to get out of there, comes over here his second game now in a Raven unit. Yeah, and he's trying to adjust his scramble right here. He starts to run his route. Now he sees, okay, now he's just got to try to find that open spot, planned zone, and he does it, and then he just loses his footing there. That's first down. Back to go to a third and 19. Three-man rush. Flag. Caught at the 25 and up to the 31. Goes Tylan Wallace. Blakeman telling us. Illegal formation. Offense. Number 70 was not on the line of scrimmage. The five-yard penalty. We play third down. Big emphasis again with those tackles. They get back a little bit too much depth. That's what they ended up calling here. It's just the operation of it. Not a ton of it. Yeah, that makes sense. It will decline it. But the operation of this is what's got to be frustrating. John Harbaugh. This is the first time you've watched a lot of the Ravens tonight. It's not the way it's gone all year. I mean, you're talking about an offense that's on a pace to be one of the best offenses in the history of the NFL. I mean, they're averaging 7.13 yards per play through the first nine weeks. That's second best in the history of the NFL. And tonight, a combination of them just kind of being out of sync. And the Bengals deserve a lot of credit for the way they're playing tonight. Stout's fourth punt of the night. Short kick, fair catch, call for made at the 33. You make a great point here. You got to go back, you know, like the greatest show on turf. Yeah. The Rams back in 2000. Yeah. And what they were doing, of course, you know, Marshall Falk. Yeah. Kurt Warner. Isaac Bruce. Right. You're looking at the Ravens are a team that came in second in scoring and first in total yardage. Yeah, I mean, really every aspect, third down, you know, passing, rushing, so balanced, so explosive. But tonight, not only have they not been on the field a lot, but they've been behind the sticks, first and 15. because he had to pump that. The offensive lineman, because without the ball getting out quickly, that's another second where they get another yard or two downfield. So that's why they brought that one back. Five wide. First and 15. Jackson can't get him that time. He does get the ball away. That's incomplete. Second down, Joseph Asai that time put the heat on. It is so tough to be able to get Lamar Jackson. When you do, you have to collapse the pocket. You cannot get upfield because that creates those lanes for him to step up in. And that time they did a good job as a foursome of just kind of squeezing him. Once again, the Ravens with that penalty, that theme tonight, they are behind the sticks yet again. and there's Burrow who's thrown for 228 tonight Jackson is thrown for 91 on 18 attempts he'll keep it and get upended at the 42 yard line so it's third down and long Lamar only his third carry of the night Todd Munkin in his second year as an offensive coordinator We just talked about the numbers and the job that they're doing. Tonight, they are trying to find some answers. A big part of that would be not self-destructing. Seven penalties on the night. A lot of the times, again, it's putting them back behind and making them play catch-up on third down, another third and long. So Lou Anarumo, his defense doing yeoman work tonight, third down and 11. deep, deep drop pressured again all the way back and just flips it away caught and taken to the 26 yard line is Justice Hill well, a sound you don't hear very often these days at M&T Bank Stadium they want to know what's going on here this is a team that three times this year whatever Three times this year. This is a team that has scored 41 points in three games. And tonight, seven points. Nothing going. Cincinnati has bottled them up. Meantime, Stout is now making his fifth punt of the night. Taken to the 16. There's a flag. Tackled with the 17. It's Irwin. running it back. Lou Anarumo has decided to crank this defense up on Thursday night football, and a big audience let this league know that these guys are still playing good football. What a challenge any time you go up against Lamar Jackson. But they have met the challenge so far. On the road, on three days rest. During the kick, holding, receiving team number 27. Telling it's half the distance to the goal line. First down, Cincinnati. 8.58 left in the third. The Bengals are on top. 21-7. Offer 228 tonight. Not even halfway through the third quarter. Adds a few more here on a pass out to the 13-yard line to Tanner Hudson. Second and five. Into that drive when Lamar Jackson came off the field. It was on that quarterback draw play where he got hit by a bunch of Bengals players. As he goes over on the sideline, talks to the trainers, kind of flexing that right hand, that throwing hand out. Well, the backup is Josh Johnson, who's been around so long. He's played with 14 teams. The Ryan Fitzpatrick of his era. Second and six. Burrow dumps it off. Drop. And it's incomplete. Brown never had control of it. Covered by Humphrey. Third down and six. Joe's done a really good job of mixing up those quick underneath throws in space against his zone defense and getting those eyes of the linebackers and his safeties to come down, to come up, and then he's able to kind of get it behind as well. We saw that with Jamar Chase on that long touchdown run. So whichever direction they take away, he's got options underneath or above it. going to reset the play clock. Gets reset at 25. Burrow brings him back into the huddle on a third and six. Now Jamar Chase so far this year, they're third and 15. The Bengals are playing a lot of multiple tight end sets tonight without Tee Higgins. Kosicki at times can almost be a receiver. But I think one of the big losses is Eric Hall. He's out now, and it really is impacting how this offense can attack. But they're still trying to work through Sample, Hudson, and Kosicki into this game. Have to get to the 49 of Baltimore. Burrow rolling against the green. And he's taken down. He does nothing. the punt. And Abike chases him down for a down. This is the guy that they're waiting to start to become more violent in the pass game. And I'll tell you, this is some pretty good speed. It gives you an idea how he can run for a 305-pound man. I mean, Joe Burrow can go. Joe starts to turn it on, but it's too late. He knocks that ball loose, but it goes out of bounds. So Rico to kick again. His first punt, 46 yards. Wallace back at the 15. Wallace calls for a fair catch. And makes it at the 20-yard line. 5-1-1 left in the half. 7-7. It really puts the pressure he faces into perspective. He may wind up in the Hall of Fame someday. So the guys will be in Canton for that induction. He's close from the 20-yard line. Here's Henry. Henry unable to get on track tonight. Derrick Henry has now carried the ball six times for 22 yards, and that defense will take that. Yeah, they do a good job of setting the edge there. When you run left, you've got to be aware of Trey Hendrickson. Excited tonight to watch Hendrickson not just defend the run, but especially when he and Ronnie Stanley go head-to-head. Look at this last week, four sacks. But on the year, he leads the entire NFL with 11 sacks, having a great year. He has 11 of their 17. Two in front of Dexter Lawrence with a lead in that department. Quick throw, caught, about a five-yard gain, Charlie Kohler. And we're going to keep an eye on this throughout the game. Ronnie Stanley back healthy this year, having as good of a year of a left tackle as anybody. And when you're confident in your guy there, you don't have to chip. You don't have to put a tight end over there. There he gets a little bit of help on the inside. But for the most part right now, it's early. The ball's getting out pretty quick. But it's early. But Ronnie Stanley holding his own against the number one sack man in the NFL. On a third and five. Jackson. And deep down the left side, he had two Ravens that were there, and it's broken up. D.J. Turner breaking it up. He had two Ravens in the same neighborhood. That ball floated a little bit. And keep in mind, the greatest asset that D.J. Turner has is his speed. He's a 4-2 guy, and this ball comes out a little bit late. I think Lamar floats it a little bit, working from the right over to the left. And then watch Turner catch up to that football. Really good play there on third down. I don't even know if he saw the ball, but he got in position and knocked it away. Oh, yeah, Flowers and Andrews both there. Meanwhile, for Stout, now his third punt of the night. And that one's out of bounds at about the 27-yard line. 4-0-2 to halftime, and we're back in 30 seconds. When that wild shootout that they had a month ago in Cincinnati, He was 17 14 Bengals at the half Tonight a different story thus far 7 7 4-0 to go in the first half And Burrow hands the ball off gain a one here chase Brown's been a busy man that he had 27 carries Last Sunday, so on three days rest eight tonight, and meanwhile there goes Jackson Looks fine. Yeah It could just be, what do we call it, a potty break? Yeah, you can call it that. I don't know, whatever you want to call it that. By the way, that was Kyle Hamilton again, walked up there in the box, playing that dime linebacker spot, able to penetrate, made a nice play. Second and ten. Burrow stepping up, throws on the run, and that's going to be holed in. Enough of the first half. Gasicki is right there. So Gasicki coming off his best game as the Cincinnati Bengals moves the chains. Here comes Lamar. Yeah, good to see him back. Two things. Brown shirt when they complete their elite training. Harbaugh takes pride in recognizing the player who did the dirty work to get the job done. And it's no easy feat. Guess who just earned his first in seven seasons? Lamar Jackson. First one. He was hyped to get it after beating Tampa Bay two games ago. Yeah, you would think he'd have a few by now. Meanwhile, here's the debut for little Herbert. Just came over from Chicago, and he drops the ball and recovers it himself. So that is quite a debut. That would be the definition of inauspicious. Yeah, I think that's fair to say. The fumble here, I thought he was maybe going to roll up on Alex Kappa once his ball went down on the ground. That ball's in there. Like you said it the first opportunity I mean there Kappa getting pushed back on top of him Bengals are very fortunate to get that football back He comes out immediately and Brown is back in there. Second and 11. Burrow. Look out. Escapes. Throws. And had a man chase but overthrew him there. So it'll be third down and 11. Like we talk about, this guy's athletic ability gets away from two different defenders who have hands on him. Owe, I think, had him. Right here, he's wrapped up. He looks like he's down. That's all the hard part. And then he's got a wide open Jamar Chase, but still getting pressured there at the end by our Darius Washington. Burrow now to 50%, 9 of 18. flanked by a couple of tight ends in the backfield and throws to one of them and fighting his way up to the 39-yard line is Tanner Hudson who'd lined up flanking Burrow but it's going to be fourth down. He's a yard shy, fourth and one. Yeah, they've gone for it a couple times on fourth down but in their own territory here. Pretty good effort by Hudson to give them a chance but Ravens defense does their job and the Bengals with Zach Taylor will punt here for the first time. and the rookie punter is Ryan Rico and a BYU free agent picked him up Tylan Wallace sets up at the 10-yard line for the Bengals very high kick sky-high there but up at the 16-yard line by a Wallace 7-7 with the Ravens and the ball when we come back. He's going to end up surpassing Michael Vick for most rushing yards by a quarterback. And at age 27, he's going to, what I used to call, Gretzky the record book. He's going to be so far in front of whoever comes behind him. Meanwhile, he's got a false start here on Ronnie Stanley. Offense number 79, five-yard penalty, first down. He used to say Gretzky the record book, But now Alex Ovechkin is just coming up behind him. Is he close? Close enough. Okay. Should get it. Here's the penalty on the left side. Oh, actually right there in the middle of your screen. The left tackle. That's Lamar Jackson's reaction. First and ten. Frustrated to get behind the sticks. Play fake. Flowers. Nothing. Covered very well. Cam Taylor Britt makes another good play. I was going to say, Cam Taylor-Britt, it's not just a tackle. It's getting off of the block. I mean, this is a tough ask here. You know, you're going right into the boundary, quick throw, fake the handoff, and he just gets around him using his quickness. So, you know, from time to time, this secondary, their eyes are looking into that backfield. They get out of position. But that time, 29 did exactly what he needed to do. What a play. Loss of five, second down and 20. Henry. Fights his way. Hit him about five. Stays inbounds there, but sets up a third down and long. Third and 15. Funny to hear Jordan Battle fired up there. The backup safety, 27. He, of course, went to Alabama. Derrick Henry went to Alabama. He probably waited a long time to have a chance to make that hit on the big fella. It is incredible how a five-yard penalty to start a drive can get you behind the sticks, give the defense confidence, and now here you are at third and 15 at your own 11. And then a five-yard loss and a five-yard gain, and there you are with ten minutes to go in the opening half. Spread it out. Go five wide on third. Again, what I talked about earlier, they get these opportunities. They're not settling for field goals. They think they're going to have to outscore Lamar Jackson. Well, they're not going to kick the field goal. So much for that. So much for the field goal attempt. It won't end with a field goal attempt. It'll end with a fourth and goal. Crowd rising as one. Brown and Sample, the tight end, are in the backfield. Now Brown out of the slot. Burrow chase. Burrow under pressure. In trouble. Fires. Incomplete. but the flag is from the end zone. Trying to hit Chase Brown. He was covered. Flag thrown. Burrow again. Two plays in a row. Chased out of the pocket. Yeah, I think they got defensive holding against Jamar Chase. Brandon Stevens. That's where the flag was thrown. Holding defense from the 21. He's half the distance to the goal line. Yeah, that's the guy. If they're going to pick on anybody tonight, it's 21. Chase works inside, tries to work his way back out, and you'll see him grab a hold of him as he tries to work back to the outside. And it's fourth and goal, so they get first and goal now. From the one. Looking for the end zone and finding it. Chase Brown for the touchdown. So the Bengals come in after scoring 41 against Vegas. Go down the field. Ravens won the toss and deferred. And Cincinnati says take this. 70 yards in 12 plays. Four runs. Eight passes to take the lead. And I think for people watching, remember how this game went that Al referred to earlier when they met in week five. And went into overtime. High scoring. Both quarterbacks put up big, big numbers. I think Cincinnati, again, they came in. anticipating having to score touchdowns. They catch a break on that defensive holding call on fourth down, able to punch it in and worked five minutes, over five minutes off the clock on that drive to keep Lamar Jackson on the sideline. And then McPherson for the extra point. And with 9.23 to go in the opening quarter, underway on Thursday night football in Baltimore, Bengals 7, Ravens nothing. This is a perfect night. Drive. Big crowd. And a very lively one. But they were quieted by the Bengals, at least for the moment. As the Ravens will get the ball at the 30-yard line. And that's where we'll see Lamar Jackson go to work. I mean, Joe Burrow saying he's playing his best ball for Jackson. He's already won two MVP awards. There he was last week against the Broncos. He threw as many touchdown passes as incompletions, and that rating was perfect. Four times in his career, he's had what would be a perfect quarterback rating, 158.3. Just amazing, not just last week, but the entire season. 20 touchdowns on the year, two interceptions. There was a time he was an athlete playing quarterback. He's now a quarterback who happens to be really athletic. And he's flanked by Derrick Henry. And what a signing that was. A picket to him. Jackson going deep on the first play and broken up at the 32-yard line. Trying to get it to Bateman all the way downfield. And Cam Taylor Britt breaks it up. So they go for the gold on play number one incomplete. And they move Bateman from the right to the left, just trying to create a matchup. Give a tail there to the coverage. Get Lamar Jackson to understand what he has. And he actually has Bateman behind the coverage there. Britt came over to Tiller. Britt came over a little bit late, recovered nicely, and actually got a hand on that football. Dayton will be their number two receiver. I mean, Zay Flowers, number four. There he is going to the right side. He's been fantastic. And here goes Henry. And when you think you've got him stopped, he'll pick up another couple of yards as well, taking tacklers with him. Turns a two- or three-yard gain into a six-yard gain, third down and four. Baltimore has had the Bengals number. I mean, Lamar Jackson alone, 9-1 as a starter against the Bengals. In the last three games, eight touchdowns and has not thrown an interception. See how he does here on this third down. He gets to that third and four. You're at the mercy of the play calling. It's Todd Monk in the offensive coordinator. He can run it, get him on the edge, or throw it. Henry Osa Hill is in, and Justice Hill gets taken down. That tackle right there. B.J. Hill takes care of Justice Hill. What a job, you know, VJ and the maneuvering around in the pocket. What he does a good job of is the fundamentals when he moves around. Two hands on the football in case that ball gets hit. But keeping his eyes downfield. But he is a tremendous, very underrated athlete, quarterback in this Bengals team. Brown through the middle. Runs into a bunch of purple shirts. It'll be third down and four on the game's opening drive. as the Bengals have run seven plays, three on the ground. They go fast here. They pick up the tempo. Three runs, four passes, third and four. Now Burrow will slow it down. Joe made a comment to us this week, the respect that he has for Lamar Jackson. He said the possessions will be limited. When we get our chances, we cannot settle for field goals. We've got to score touchdowns. So they race up to the line of scrimmage and take the play clock down to six seconds. in the pocket. Open, making the catch and taking it to the five-yard line is Josibas. Andre Josibas, second year out of Princeton, and sets up a first down and goal for Cincinnati. They continue to attack the interior of the linebackers. He works over the middle. Simpson goes out, and that opens up the interior there to make that great throw on third down. Really good patience there by Burrow. Let's the play develop. And I'll tell you, even without T. Higgins, they still have plenty of weapons there on the outside. Josie Vosch has caught 16 balls this year for them for touchdowns. Ninth player this drive. Burrow looks left, throws there, and making the catch at the three-yard line is Mike Gesicki. So, Gesicki in his first year with the Bengals last week, two touchdowns in the game against the Raiders. Now, as you know, what a great weapon anywhere on the field, but especially down in the low red area with that length at 6'6". He's a tough matchup, and Joe, Joe in the red area is so good. You know, they're third in the entire league in touchdown percentage down here. It's because of his decision-making and how accurate he can throw. The hard one now wants to throw the flag. You saw him talking to the official, and he wants to make sure that was a catch, so he uses the flag early on. A little bit more than five minutes into the game that the catch was good. The knee is down. Appears to have control. And then the ball comes out as Hamilton makes the tackle along the sidelines. So... All right. At worst, second and goal. Back after this. Cars is its first time out and also loses its first challenge. to me the most interesting aspect of that is the challenge I mean it's going to be second and goal regardless from the five or from the three so is it a challenge worth two yards? No you tell me I lose the timeout? Yeah second down goal Burrow to the end zone reaching up it's incomplete too high for Chase covered there by Humphrey third down and goal. Would that be a great matchup when the Ravens do play man to man Humphrey against Jamar Chase, talking to Humphrey on the field before the game, just talking about what makes Jamar Chase so good. He said he's basically a running back that's playing wide receiver, yet he can run at an elite level when it comes to routes. That time he's in a really good position in coverage. Here comes the 11th play of the opening drive. And the timeout taken here by Baltimore. They may have had an extra man on the field. Baltimore takes its second time out of the half. This will be a 30-second timeout. I mean, the timeouts in the first half aren't that big. But to me, going back to the challenge, you know, you lose a challenge, and that's a lot bigger than losing the timeout in the first half. Yeah, and I think the operation with Zach Orr, remember, he's in his first year as a defensive coordinator. It's not just calling the plays. It's also being organized, everybody getting in and out. That time, as you said, the 12th man, almost the penalty, they end up getting that timeout. You're just so conditioned that the Ravens are going to have one of the best defenses in the league. And it still works. I mean, it's still weeks and weeks ahead of them. But at this point, they just have not been that consistent team you'd expect to see. Third and goal. Chased out. Burrowing. Throwing and just has to throw it away. So that's how they got the pass rush that they very much needed. And so this drive will result in a field goal attempt after they went down the field from their own 30, 11 plays and 68 yards. Bengals thinks he's got man-to-man coverage and a chance to go over top of him. But instead, Stevens showed man ends up sinking back and fools Joe Burrow there, I think, completely. You've got to give Stevens a lot of credit for that one. So the play is under review. Question is, did he stay in bounds after the pick? well pretty interesting they're looking at it back after this we're moving on the field an incomplete pass the second foot came down out of bounds we have a second down from the previous spot so here's the situation before the left foot gets down, the right foot is out of bounds. And therefore, that's the ruling. The toe got down, but as that foot continued to slide, the outside of that toe, almost the pinky toe, hit the white before the left foot got down. So Cincinnati with the ball on the second down and five now. Burrow, pressured, picked up from behind. And Abike takes him down. Clock continues to run. They've got two timeouts. They're not worried about that. Interesting. Zach Taylor started to run to the official, and then he wanted the clock to work down. Now he calls a timeout, being respectful of Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' offense. Two hands on the ball by Burrow. Give credit to this defensive front. Again, Mataboukate, that's the guy they've been waiting to see play this year. He has been a force chasing down Joe Burrow tonight. Mataboukate. Got it, Texas A&M. Fifth year. Had a great year last year. So how about this? The fourth down on the opening drive, they get a defensive holding on fourth down. Inside the five. Gave them the chance to get their only touchdown. Now they have it overruled with the interception. So another chance to capitalize on a break. Gave credit for a sack. Two in the game, 44 seconds. Burrow fires over the middle, caught. And that's going to make it a first down and goal, Tanner Hudson. Well, that's actually Jermaine Burton who makes the catch. Burton makes the catch, his first grab of the night. There's the rookie. Matched up against Stevens. Burton, there's never a question about Jermaine Burton's ability. On the far left, press coverage, separation. That gives you an idea how much confidence that Joe Burrow has in him. That ball was out before he made this cut. And the young rookie delivers in the clutch here and almost fought his way into the end zone. So it's going to be first down and goal. Each team is out of timeouts right now. So either Baltimore gets the ball and Jackson, no timeouts to work with. Meanwhile, Cincinnati trying to take the lead before the half. And a first-handed goal with 36 seconds. Got Jamar Chase by himself on the left. Safety over top. Burrow looks that way. Flushed out. Throws. Caught. In the end zone. Touchdown. And that is Tanner Hudson. Hudson. So Hudson took that snap from center on a fourth and one and made it making his presence very much felt in this first half. What a job as you'd expect. Give the offensive line credit because Joe Burrow looked left to Jamar Chase. He ends up being doubled once again. He's got to get away from some of the trouble and then he finds Hudson who had sat down there for that touchdown. So 10 plays, 73 yards. Took him three and a half. McPherson now for the extra point. And the Bengals go up by a score of 14-7. Marcus Williams ends up doubling Jamar Chase. His body will turn. They're just kind of bracketing him. So that takes, well look at Joe's eyes. He's looking left. Now Hudson's out here. Watch how Hudson just sits in that soft spot of the zone. He's just squaring up to Burrow and just settling in. A yard or two inside that goal line makes it an easy target. Somehow the Ravens defense lost him, miscommunicated, and you don't want to do that to number nine once he gets out and breaks contain. Second career touchdown catch for Hudson who's been in the league for five seasons. He was actually on the Tampa Bay roster back in. Second and 20. Third and 15. That last one, third and 19. Just not found their river. And averaging about four and a half yards per play. Burrow. Fires. Caught. Chase. They're trying to chase him down. And they came back. Touchdown. How special is he when he gets out in the open field? 67 yards. for Jamar Chase on their first play of the second half. And now the Ravens are put in a two-touchdown hole. Watch the linebacker play, and it's been a weakness of this Baltimore defense in coverage trying to locate the crosser. Look at that space. Great job from a timing standpoint. And then this is just next level. Probably the best in the league. Almost that running back skill set to pull away from the Ravens. He did it in week five in Cincinnati. Matty does it again here on a Thursday night to put the Bengals up by a couple scores. McPherson for the extra points. That's eight receiving touchdowns for Chase. That's the most in the NFL at this point of the season. We have to wait all day for next Thursday night. It's a beauty. Look at this one. Jaden Daniels, our first look at him. What a story the Commanders have been this season. Jalen Hurts and the Eagles. That's Thursday night football from the Lake in Philadelphia next week, 8.15 Eastern Time. Kickoff. So a 14-point lead. And after hesitating, Mitchell's going to come out of the end zone and get tackled at the 28-yard line. Joe Burrow has been focused and locked in. Look at those eyes right there. What an opportunity here. Steps up again, feels it, reads the coverage, soft spot, puts it out in front of Jamar Chase. and now it again is a foot race for Chase. Remember, this defense does not have Kyle Hamilton, the leader, one of the leaders on that back end, and number one, make some pay for it, have a little bit of fun in the end zone and now on the sideline. Get some jewelry for a reasonable backstimulation thereof. From the 28-yard line, up the middle goes Derrick Henry. Keep him bottled up tonight. Picks up four yards there, so Henry's now carried seven times. 26 yards. Remember, their first matchup, they were determined to stop him and his ability to run the football. They loaded up, and, you know, he only had that 41 yards until they got into overtime. Longest run tonight, 7 yards. Nice to meet you. Hey, hey, time's my fun. Time's my fun. Yeah. Hey. Nice to meet you. again. And they stop him again. Third down. That big hit there with Logan Wilson. This defense, man, they are locked in. And the better Joe Burrow plays, the more confidence that they play on their side of the football. The rookie McKinley Jackson in there trying to hold the point. Not a lot of room in the interior. There's the big hit by 55. the leader in the middle of that defense, Logan Wilson. Third and four. Jackson, pressured. Can't be brought down from behind. Gets the pass away and it's caught. Bateman, first down. That time, he had Hendrickson almost picked up his 12th sack of the season. Yeah. Couldn't come any closer. The ball's been getting out so quickly. He hadn't had much of a chance to really get after the quarterback. But here on this third round, there's that bend. The length he extends, it just misses him. Look how close that is. Gets his right hand on the leg. But Lamar Jackson, not just the athletic ability, but the eyes to locate the receiver for that first down. Flowers. To the 50-yard line. Gain of about six, and we go to Kaylee. Guys, the news, the Ravens did not want to hear Kyle Hamilton will not return to this game. He's officially been ruled out because of that ankle injury. Only good news would be he's got three extra days to get ready for the next game. Downfield offense, number 65, five-yard penalty. He played first down. So Patrick McCary was illegally downfield, so there goes that would be game. That's an RPO, and I think the blitz right here creates a little bit of hesitation. That's a run or a pass, and that hesitation now to stand out there once again. Joe Burrow climbing the pocket. Gusecki's right over here. Watch how he feels his pressure. You better get a push from the middle, and then watch Gusecki come back to the football. Works his way back, and that's the difference between that ball getting knocked down and making that completion. How about Burrow under duress making that throw? Gain of 13 from the 40-yard line now. Brown chugs his weight for a gain of five. He's been under pressure pretty much throughout his entire career since he's been in Cincinnati. I think he's just one of these guys who's got a linebacker mentality. His father of former defensive coordinator in college football. Brothers played at linebacker at Nebraska. So here he is. It's not to the outside. It's him stepping up, maneuvering, eyes downfield, locating Lamar Chase there. Just did a nice one to Gusecki. So I think he has a feel inside that pocket as well as anybody in this league. There goes Hamilton. You saw Hamilton come up to the line. Lurking. Goes back into coverage. Second down and six. Flip it here. And a nice move there by Tanner Hudson to pick up the first down. And that takes us to the two-minute warning. That much time left in the half, 7-7 in Baltimore. Hold the ripcord, you're out. I had to. State Farm halftime still coming up. Two minutes to the half from the 49-yard line first down. Burrow fires over the middle and finds his man. He's got Jamar Chase for a gain of 14. what a job there again by Burrow getting pressure this time they do get a push up the middle and there's that connection to chemistry between Jamar Chase and his quarterback Joe Burrow able to somehow work that around Trenton Simpson but look at him take the hit as he follows through he's getting his arms getting hit but still has enough on it to get that ball there for the first down Bengals have two timeouts. Rush four. Open. 30-yard line. Brown. First down and a few more. Kyle Hamilton there. You saw Brown make a move. He went down immediately. One of the top defenders in the league, let alone on this Ravens defense. he's sitting out there in zone with Gusecki, and then the ball gets thrown. He'll start to kind of want to react to Chase Brown, and then, boy, you can see that, like maybe the right leg, the right foot. Baltimore player number 14 was injured on the play. Inside of two minutes, that requires a nice team timeout to Baltimore. Timeout for the injury. It's up, hobbles to the sideline, and here's what happened. Yeah, and it looks like he steps on Gusecki there, and then you can see the right, we talked earlier, the right foot. Got a little bit of a twist there after he stepped on him, so he goes into the 10th. And that comes with 69 seconds to halftime. You got Darius Washington coming in, in that role, so to speak. Very few guys like Hamilton. And meanwhile, Burrow to the end, almost to the end zone, but incomplete. Again, Gesicki going up in the air. Hoey put the pressure on. I think Hoey got a head start. I think that's what he did. He came in. Shot out of a cannon. And they caught him. Offside. Defense number 99. And the neutral goes with a snap. Five-yard penalty. Still first down. The right guard gives that signal that the offensive line is ready. And I think Owe jumped it, kind of anticipating that Ted Karras, the center, would snap that football right with that movement. And he just got out a little bit early. So I think Burrow felt that, even though it was in his blind side. I think he felt that he got that jump, had a free play, tried to squeeze it into Kosicki, but still gets the five-yard penalty. First and five. Burrow has the serving. to the end zone as it picked off in the end zone. It's Stevens, Brandon Stevens with the pick. Again, they go to Sikki's way, and Burrow throws only his fifth interception of the season, and the first he's not thrown in the fourth quarter. This goes to show you that even the best in the business can sometimes get fooled, stacked right here. watch the coverage and watch what happens to Joe Burrow here. You see him sinking Stevens. Right now, I think he... ...to play a division game. Ravens come in 6-3. Bengals are 4-5 and the Browns 2-7. Zach Taylor is in his sixth season as the Bengals head coach. Took him to the Super Bowl in 2021. And John Harbaugh is in his unbelievably 17th year. How fast that has gone. That's amazing. That's tremendous. Burrow and Jackson both having great seasons. And Lamar, very much probably, I would say right now, the frontrunner to win the MVP award. Certainly in the conversation, he's already won two of those. Ravens to kick off. They won the toss to third. And Joe Burrow will set up shop at the 30-yard line after the touchback. So Burrow telling us the other day, he's playing the best ball of my career is the way he put it. five to one touchdown to interception ratio 20 against four completing 70% of his passes look at him in the open tonight and you saw how upset he was last week despite the fact they put up 41 five touchdowns but he is a perfectionist started out of the gun put chase in motion to the left side they don't have T Higgins tonight he's out for at least one more game and they go right to the air, and it's a seven-yard game. Chase Brown coming off a great game last week. 157 scrimmage yards against Las Vegas. Picks up seven, it'll be second down and three. And you'll see a lot of that tonight. That's really an extension of their run game. They don't run the football a lot, but they'll get the ball to Chase Brown underneath against that zone coverage, which Baltimore's had some problems with with their linebackers this year. Remember, they're dead last in the NFL in pass defense. And they're number one against the run. Second down and three. Off play action. Burrow steps up, finds his man, goes to chase. He caught seven balls last week and has seven touchdowns this season. Most of any receiver and a first down. Joe attacking that underneath coverage these first couple plays. Joe, you mentioned it. That's a strong statement. The guy's played some pretty good football and for him to say at week 10, and it's the best that I've played in my career, I think The biggest thing he means by that, it's been the most consistent that he's been able to play this year. And I think they're really looking forward to the opportunity tonight and in the back half of this season this year. From the 43. Up the middle. Nothing happening there. And the Ravens, as we mentioned, number one against the run. Matabuke stopping Chase Brown after a one-yard pickup, second down and nine. They have such strength in the interior with Travis Jones now that he's healthy. Matabuke is quick. Roderick Washington, they just create that wall, free those linebackers up to get downhill. So you're not going to see a lot of running tonight. Zach Orr has such a talented front when it comes to defending that run. first year defensive coordinator Mike McDonald was here did such a great job, he's now the head coach from Seattle, that pass is broken up incomplete, Marlon Humphrey gets in there to bat it away, Jermaine Burton, the rookie out of Alabama, who is playing tonight even though he was inactive last week because he missed a couple of meetings yeah, he is back and with T. Higgins down, it's a huge opportunity for the rookie to get an opportunity to show what he can do. Pretty tight coverage. Great to see Marlon Humphrey, who's lined up against there. One of the best in the league now that he's healthy. Humphrey in his eighth season. He was the number one pick out of Alabama back in 2017. Third and nine. Burrow stepping up, stepping forward and throwing, and it's caught. And to the 30-yard line goes Jamar Chase. So Burrow coming forward just before he got to the line of scrimmage is able to complete that for 26 yards. This is a great example of what these two have been doing for a long time. You'll see Jamar Chase off to your right, eventually coming to the picture. That's zone. So there's the soft spot. And watch how Joe maneuvers his way around, eyes downfield, and Jamar Chase settles and works back to stay right in alignment there with a vision of his quarterback. Put a fullback in here. Give it to Brown to the outside. Breaks one tackle. Not another, though. And picks up one. Got away from David Ojabo. It'll be second down, and let's call it eight. Need a two. Yeah, I think Joe Burrow does not get the recognition of the athletic ability in 20 when they won the Super Bowl. So 14 to 7. Burrow checking out the tablet. Probably a little. Well, I don't know if he's happy tonight. Who knows? You never know, right? He's a perfectionist, you know, as we mentioned before. Talked about how Zach Taylor waited. Let that clock run a little bit. Just in case you end up putting a touchdown on the board. You don't want to give Baltimore and Lamar Jackson any time. They end up giving them 30 seconds. 30 and no timeouts. Kaylee, what you got? Well, guys, the Bengals got in the end zone there while the Ravens' jack-of-all-trades defensive back Kyle Hamilton was in the X-ray room. We saw him limping off the field, unable to put much weight on his right leg. We're told he's questionable to return. They're looking at his ankle. Yeah, huge loss if he can't come back. He does everything. He affects the entire defense because of the way they use him at linebacker, at nickel, back in the safety spot. So you're going to have to use two or three defenders to replace one guy. so they can pick up enough of a chunk here to set up Tucker they go to the outside this is a short game Andrews that takes only four seconds off the clock second and seven so Jackson Wright 8 of 11 51 yards only carried the ball one time tonight they've only run the ball 8 times 31 yards with the jogging we talked earlier about this defense and the way they play now their own offense has kept Lamar on the sideline but 51 yards passing in this first half so far to Lamar Yeah 2 time of possession Indeed keeping Jackson on the bench. Fires over the middle, and that's incomplete. And that'll make it with Akeem Davis-Gather covering on the play. Third down and seven. You know, for Cincinnati, we're talking about their defense. Lou Anarumo, especially in the Super Bowl year, very highly sought after assistant coach. A lot of people thought he'd be a head coach. I know he got some interviews. But now all of a sudden he went from one of the hot assistants to a guy under the gun because the Cincinnati defense has not played as well as people would expect. Yeah, I think you and I still realize he's one of the top assistants out there. He does a heck of a job. He's got his defense, again, dialed in tonight, but definitely not putting up the numbers they did earlier a couple years ago. Third and seven. Jackson floats one. Andrews gets out of bounds. And he got a flag down. Still outside of field goal range. And we'll see about the penalty. Prior to the pass, holding defense number 57. Jones decline. He already gained his first down. Yeah, they'll take the play, which is 14 yards. So now you got, you're at the 47. You know, for Justin Tucker, the sky's the limit. Not necessarily the way it used to be. He's kind of had some issues this year with 50-yard field goals and beyond. How much do they wish they had those two timeouts that they needed to use? Remember, they used one on a review. They ended up having 12 men on the field. And that opening drive on defense, they burned two. Right. So you've got to work the outside. You're almost compelled to. unless you want to fling a Hail Mary instead they work the middle but the tackle is made inbounds so Deontay Johnson they just picked up they're going to race the ball to the middle of the field but not enough time right there that's the end of it Mike Hilton, the nickel, makes a heck of a play there in space that was a race to see who was going to get there and he got Johnson before he could get out of bounds Zay Flowers tries to make the block heck of a job there by the veteran Hilton So it's 14-7. Bengals, we go to Kaylee. Well, Zach, your offense has controlled time of possession 2-1. What do you need to see from them in the second half? Keep possessing the ball. You know, we've got to keep it moving forward. Had a couple plays that set us back. That's where we wouldn't be able to punt, get back on track situations. I thought defense did a great job starting the game, finishing the half. We're going to call them on the punt again to start the right way in the third quarter. Well, and when you've been limiting the amount of time that the Ravens' offense can even be on the field, you have still been able to bottle up Lamar and Derrick Henry when they've had their chances. Yeah, I mean, our defense is a big part of that. You know, they've held them to a three and out. They've done a good job getting them off the field. So, probably the way they're playing, we've got to keep it up. It's going to be a long game. Exactly. Rumo, before this game started, the first half, Lamar Jackson would have 71 yards passing and Derrick Henry 22 yards on the ground. He'd say, wow, take it. Take that all day. and the Ravens have only 102 yards, period. Off the field in time, when a substitution. Too many men on the field. Defense. Five-yard penalty. What is gained is enough for a first down. He substituted, tried to get the right personnel in, and in doing that, get more defensive backs. They're trying to get Jermaine Pratt off. He hustles off. He just stepped short. Lamar said, no, no, no. We got him. Ball now at the 29-yard line on the first down. Lou Anarumo, defensive coordinator in his sixth year, in that role with the Bengals. Jackson, play fake, throws, caught, flowers, breaks the tackle, spins around. It's around Pratt, gets tackled there for a gain of 11 on the first down. Boy, you'd love to see this. High formation, old school football. You got Derrick Henry back there. Fullback, they're going to run the football right on first and ten. Look at the Bengals. They got three linebackers in this game expecting the run. Instead, this is what Todd Munkin does such a good job of, breaking that trend, go the other way, get him on the edge, and give him a chance to be able to make that throw on the run. So dangerous. Waning seconds of the quarter. In fact, the Bengals will let the clock run out. And that will take us to the end of the first quarter. With the Bengals leading the Ravens. 7-0 on Thursday night football. Tonight on prime. Really looking forward to that one. Daniels hurts. The whole thing going on. It's going to be great. Good one there. Second quarter begins. Al Michaels per Curve Street. Kaylee Hart time on a first and ten. Henry gets the toss. Henry down the sideline. and then he picks up a few before he's pushed out of bounds. The whole thing, Al, as you know, is can he get started? Can he get downhill? The Bengals did a good job until overtime in week five of bottling him up, preventing him from getting downhill. And when he does, that's where those infamous stiff arms come. That's where he runs over those safeties and defensive backs. That time they were able to get him around the corner for a positive gain of seven. Here he is again And that time the coverage is very good I mean normally he gets rolling Like I say He is like an 18-wheeler Rolling down a country two-lane road Third down is Keith Jackson I know You know what I'm talking about I get it every week It's great No, but that time is really well played By Sam Hubbard Kind of controlling the edge So they get Lamar Jackson again to third down haven't seen any of the zone read stuff they kind of sprinkle it in he didn't run the football much at all last week he was under center for the most part like he is here he only three carries Flowers in motion third and four he throws a dart that's caught by Hill and he'll take it to the five yard line sidearm sling little slip screen by the way another Another weapon. You talk about Henry and all these other weapons. And they get to third down. And here comes 43 into the game. And they can't find him. Good job. I think Hubbard felt it. But the ball got out there. Like you said, it was a sidearm. Just a quick flip. Get it to the little man, 43. He knows what to do with it after the catch. He's strong. Tough to bring down and gets the first down. First and goal. Lamar. Wide open. Nelson Aguilar, touchdown, Baltimore. I mean, Jackson starts out like he's going to run it. You've got to think about that. It's exactly what it is. There's no offense in the entire NFL that challenges you with the eyes as much as Lamar Jackson. You're worried about, and he even puts the ball, making it look and feel like he's going to run initially. That's secondary. They've got their eyes in the backfield, and they lose focus on the receiver, Aguilar, who sneaks out behind him. Justin Tucker to try to tie the game, which he does. Two minutes into the second quarter. There's the night football in Baltimore. Locked up 7-7. Touchback to the 30-yard line. It will come, and we will go to Kelly. Well, guys, after each win, the Ravens give out what John Marbaugh calls their most prestigious award. It's a brown shirt. As unassuming as it looks, its inspiration is rooted in the Navy SEALs. It's rooted in overtime. I just don't think he wanted to. It scored four straight touchdowns, and he didn't want to roll the dice. He saw that in Cincinnati week five, and he said, let's take a chance here and try to win it while we can. So Cincinnati has declared what you have to do these days. An onside kick has to go 10 yards. And their only chance right here. So there have been 27 27 onside kicks attempted of which two have been recovered by the kicking team That's how tough it is these days. Back to the two-pointer we go This is after the throw and the two-point conversion Wow! It's another one and Joe doesn't complain very often He didn't air, he just kind of grabbed his Wow! Look at that follow-through and then you throw that and then the Gasicki. Jerry, what do you see here on both these? The hit, the follow through on his face mask and then Gasicki. Yeah, it was clearly defensive holding before the pass was in flight. That should have been called and that does look like forceful contact to the head of the quarterback. That's a person that's roughing the passer and should have been called. Too many games end this way. They just do. You miss calls, the whole thing. It's so frustrating to the fans. So frustrating. Well, it's not frustrating to the Baltimore fans tonight. Yeah. Well, Mark Andrews recovers that. And in a game that came close to matching that first game this season between these two teams, the Ravens are going to do it again, sweep the season series. Both these games were classics. Both these games were everything you'd love to see in divisional matchups. Baltimore to their credit great teams find ways to win games but a lot of people are going to be talking about both of those non-calls there on the two point conversion doesn't mean that they would have ended up winning the game but they would have definitely had another opportunity every week that will take us to the finish line and take the Baltimore Ravens to a record of 7-3. Their next game at Pittsburgh against the division leaders. And the Bengals right now 4-6. And in deep trouble in terms of their playoff hopes. 35-34. Burrow tonight, four touchdown passes, 428 yards. Jackson tonight. Four touchdown passes. 290 yards. They took care of Derrick Henry tonight. They limited him to 68. But the Ravens gained 389 yards. The Bengals 4-72. So again, tons of offense. But at the end of the day, it came down to that two-point missed conversion. So four straight touchdowns. Anticipating. This defense is coming this way. Almost anticipating that they're going to go with that sweep into the boundary. Great job by the corner. Set the edge. Yeah. Had to avoid Ricard as well, the fullback. Meanwhile, the pass is caught. Wallace makes the grab. Wallace on the sideline. Wallace is going to go all the way, assuming he stayed inbounds all the way. so on a third and two Tylan Wallace for the moment with the touchdown well we just said which one of these wide receivers is going to make a play we brought up Bateman, we brought up Flowers instead it's Wallace who ends up getting away from this defense there's Britt, misses the tackle Wilson with that stiff arm. Safety. Geno Stone comes over late. What an effort by Tyler Wallace to take that all over to the end zone. Here's a great look to see if he stayed inbounds. Right here when Wilson hits him, it comes very close. Oh, look at that. The right foot. Oh, that's the one they'll look at. Every other step he took is clearly inbounds. It was that one right foot. It was close. Almost looked like the toe was in, the heel was up. Right. That's what they're looking at right now. If it stands, it's 84 yards. They green-lighted. Yep. They confirmed it. Look at this. Now, you're right. The toe down, the heel never touches. Oh, baby. Even though you look at that, you think, oh, that foot looks like it's on the white line. But with that heel up, you're good. Check it out. What a turnaround. All good. Tucker for the point after. And of all the guys, no. Justin Tucker. Wow. Go figure that baby out. 21-20 Cincinnati. 507 attempts. But that is the difference in the game right now. He kicks off. 21-20. Bengals hanging on by a thread, and they'll start this drive from the 30-yard line. Back we go. Lou Anarumo's defense has played well tonight, and I just wonder where was the defense on this play? Watch the effort here that just slows down by Logan Wilson and Geno Stone. They think the play is made. They kind of give up on it, and then they take off. And that slight hesitation is a step or two preventing them from, at the very least pushing Wallace out of bounds. So I think they thought the play was made. They stopped, and then they tried to turn up the speed, and by then it was too late. 84 yards, longest pass of Jackson's career. Burrow, deep, and that's caught, and that's chase. We go to Kaylee. Guys, we were keeping an eye on Joe Burrow after he took that shot to his left lower ribs. just as you saw him grimace when he reached for his helmet with that left arm before the previous drive. We saw something similar happen again. This time when he reached for the helmet with his left arm, as if he was reminding himself that it actually hurt and grimaced, he then had to revert to picking up the helmet with his right arm to put it on. But he did not receive any medical attention while he was on the sideline. No, and completes that one for 17 to chase. Brown. You know, it's funny. We were talking to Hamilton the other day. about a team player. I said, hey, what's the seminal play? What's the best play of your career? He said, I wasn't even in it. It was Kylan Wallace, punt return in overtime to beat the Rams here last year. I mean, who says that? Usually it's like, well, it might have been this interception, or maybe, and he said, not even in there. Beat the Rams in OT here. It is crunch time here with under 12.30 to go. Burrow now thrown for 304 yards. 25 of 40. This time, good protection for him, but good coverage by the Ravens. As Cam Grandy, rookie, makes Zach grab it. Third down and six. Keep mixing up these personnel groupings with Dan Pitcher and Zach Taylor. Mentioned earlier, a lot of those two tight ends, three tight ends, rotating in and out. Got to try to create a matchup here. You didn't think either Gasicki would get his chance, tough matchup, or Jamar Chase. Offensive line's got to give Burrow, at the very least, time to throw and time to step up the way he has most of the night. Crowd roaring, standing. Chase and Roquan Smith knocks him out of bounds. So Jamar Chase, of course, played with Burrow at LSU. Another grab here. Burrow has now thrown for 285, and that's 149 receiving yards for number one. Now watch Roquan Smith. He knows that there's a chance to cross her. He's pointing it out, pointing it out, pointing it out, but he can't stay with him. He's in no man's land. You either try to stay with Jamar Chase, and Burrow's going to take it and run, or you start to come off of him, and that's a tough ask anyway for Roquan Smith to try to stay with Chase. Is Chase trying to go for 200 yards tonight? That's 151 now in the night. Seven catches. Burrow on his way to 300 instead he gets sacked here back at the 41 yard line out of BK again well they paid him big money expecting him to do these kind of things and he's been challenged by Zach Orr to become more violent and that's exactly what he did there going up against Volson he's able to win with that violent mentality. He has looked quick and looked dominant in the interior. Matabike playing great. Yeah, that's three sacks for him tonight. And that's going to take us to the final quarter. It'll be second and 16 when play resumes after three. Cincinnati 21. Baltimore 14. Fourth quarter, Al Michaels, Burke Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung. They're in the standings. Seahedlers lead the division 6-2 So they have 9 games left And 6 of them will be against The opposition in the AFC North 21-14 It is 2nd and 16 For the Bengals From the Baltimore 40 yard line Burrow Press it again Rolls away Dumps it off Out of the pocket To the feet of Brown And that time Van Noy, leading the team in sacks with seven, put the pressure on third down. And that was a really good job downfield with coverage. Burrow got rushed, but it was because his first and second option taken away, playing a little bit more man coverage. They've been playing a lot of zone. They mixed in a little man there, and nobody got separation. Gave the defensive front time to get to him. Burrow again pressured. Fires incomplete. Intended for chase. No flag. That time you had Adarius Washington who almost got to Burrow for the shot. Fourth down. And they walked up eight. Zach Gore decides to walk eight. Look at all those purple jerseys. And you're an offensive line. You're trying to figure out where that pressure is coming from. That's a tough thing to do in front of this crowd. Gave him enough room to at least step up. Shakes that would-be sack and almost hits that to Jamar Chase. But the pressure just enough there for the Ravens. Third punt of the night for the rookie Ryan Rico. Fair catch called for. Made at the eight-yard line by Tylan Wallace. seconds into the fourth quarter. Seven-point game. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS Lamar Jackson. Look at the yards traveled. 58 yards traveled and more than that. Look how pretty that is. I mean, if he would have taken that into the end zone, that's one of the plays of the year. Four percent probability somehow of gaining the first down, and if anybody can do it, it's Lamar Jackson. What a play. tight roping the sideline on his way down there made it pay off after the turnover and now down by seven here they go start with a pass caught short game here Bateman makes the grab Jermaine Pratt in on the tackle gain of five if the Ravens are going to come back you're going to either see Bateman or Flowers somebody's going to have to make a play on the outside for this this Ravens offense. I mean, Mark Andrews is a solid player, but you need an electrifying play to help Lamar Jackson out. The Bengals, of course, are thinking, hey, let's keep everything in front. No big plays. Keep those safeties back. Henry. Boy, they did a great job on him tonight. Cam Taylor-Britt comes up there to stop him. Third and two. They slant their defensive front to the sideline. Almost a ball back to the 29. Little dump off. Andrews. Davis Gaither makes the stop. Well, the Bengals have to start thinking about taking timeouts, and they do right here. Yep. I mean, you know, in the old days, like 20 minutes ago, you'd say automatic for Justin Tucker. One of the greats of all time. I don't think anything is automatic these days with a lot of kickers, including him who missed the extra point before. Well, and I think also you've got confidence in Laura Jackson and his decision-making and playmaking ability in the players around him. I think knowing John Harbaugh, he's going to be aggressive here. They're going to try to get a touchdown and at the same time work that clock down because of Burrow and Jamar Chase. You just can't give them any time. Second and ten. Fires. Caught. Spinning around. Takes it to the eight-yard line. Bateman. That ball was halfway in the air before Bateman got to the top of his route. That's, again, that's the difference in this offense. Here's your receiver. Watch when he throws his football. Soft coverage. I'm going to stop it right as he releases the ball. And look where Bateman is. Ball's already been well out. It's halfway through, and he's just starting to turn his head. That is tough to cover when a receiver and a quarterback are throwing it in sync, and he locates it to that outside shoulder away from the corner. That's a really good throw. Yeah, Bateman, one of those unsung guys. I think it'll be as flowers as we're getting a lot of flowers. Of course, Wallace has been the guy tonight. But Bateman's made some very key catches tonight. First and goal. And for another timeout, it was taken. And Jackson will be content to take it to the five-yard line. Takes us to the two-minute warning. Bengals have one timeout left. It'll be second and goal when we come back. Two minutes left in regulation in a tie game. I wouldn't be surprised if Cincinnati lets them score here just to give Burrow time compared to letting him work the clock down. It's a thought if Baltimore wants to go in the end zone. Jackson throws, and that's incomplete. And that's a big break for the Bengals because that stops the clock. Baton was the intended receiver, so now it's third down and goal. And the Bengals hold on to that one timeout. If you think about Baltimore running the football once, running it a second time, the Bengals will be out at timeouts. You work it all the way down to about 30 to 35 seconds. Chip shot to take the lead with 30 to 35 seconds. Compared to giving Burrow a little bit of time, yeah, you've got to go score a touchdown, but at least you have some time to work. Now they don't have to worry about that after the incompletion. Not at all. Third and goal. Jackson. Running around. Little jump pass touchdown. Bateman. Rashad Bateman. And they have the lead again. That was like a jump shot. I mean, he has shown an ability tonight to work from the pocket. He's shown the ability to get outside. He's shown a lot of velocity when he's had to put something on it. and he's also shown a lot of these touch passes that he's thrown to these receivers, to Mark Andrews. That time, like I said, when you see this follow-through, it was like a Steph Curry jump shot for a touchdown. That's four touchdown passes for Jackson tonight. The Ravens have scored touchdowns on four straight drives, and Tucker's extra point is good. So it kind of works out for Cincinnati, and it doesn't work out. They gave him points, but they have at least some time to work now for Burrow and Chase. And here's his throw. Watch this little Steph Curry, little jump. And look at the follow-through. In the perfect location, your guy, Bateman, with a go-ahead touchdown. Six gashes for Bateman tonight. Four touchdown passes for Lamar. He's going for 290 now. There's Bateman working on Taylor Britt. put that foot in the ground, works the other way he's got him, look at Lamar soon as he threw it, he starts to head to the bench you know, they had 71 yards in the first half passing, 219 in 200 yards rushing again, by the way, Burrow once again gets hit as he makes that throw and the Bengals have already started the huddle which leads us to believe they've already told Cincinnati it's going to stand even though Cleet Blakeman is looking at it. Harbaugh wants to wave it off but to no avail here because we think it's going to stand. From our inside information, whatever that is. After review, the ruling on the field stands as called. So here we go. 81 seconds, one timeout. They keep moving Jamar Chase. They've been doing it all night. He's been on the left, been in the slot. Now he's down at the bottom right here. Meanwhile, Burrow has now thrown for 399 yards. Burrow fires incomplete. Gasicki is there. He's smothered by Adarius Washington. Second and ten. Again, with Kyle Hamilton down, these defensive backs have had to move around Adarius Washington, who's a corner. He's 5'8". Gasicki is 6'5", 6'6". Gets that right hand around that length of Gasicki and is able to extend it and knock the ball away. That's a heck of a play by that undersized defensive back. To the outside. Chase. Flag is thrown on the play. That's a Marlon Humphrey. Yep. Grabbed a hold of receiver. Receiver. Seabash. Of course, if it's on the defense, it's an automatic first down. and they would take the penalty got 106 now that only took a handful of seconds he get a hold of the shoulder pad or the face mask there Humphrey well there's a conference going on here with all of the officials personal foul grabbing the face mask number 44 that'll be tacked on to the back end that's 15 more yards it's interesting they missed one face mask but got the other right You're right. And it's the veteran, Humphrey, gets that right hand up. Yosuvash there just trying to get off the line of scrimmage. So the ball now at the Raven 45. 66 seconds. Deep drop. Under pressure. Throws. He's got Chase again. And Chase to the 23. Everybody's flag is thrown on this play with two flags in the offensive backfield. Burrow got destroyed after he threw this ball. On Broderick, Washington. By the way, he's been hit all night. Gets hit underneath. Gets hit over top. They follow through. Drive him into the ground. Washington does. And look where the location of that ball is. once again under duress. He gets it to his guy, half the distance to the goal line and in a blink of an eye, they're inside the red zone. They're inside a 15-yard line. 21-yard pass, 15-yard penalty. A lot going on here. If they score, do you go for two? Meanwhile, if they score now... The Ravens have plenty of time. They've got two timeouts. 59 seconds. from the 12. Burrow to the back corner of the end zone and incomplete there. Intended for Burton. Covered by Nate Wiggins. Second down. I'm just amazed how Joe Burrow sits in that pocket. He doesn't have happy feet. He gets hit almost every time he throws. every week of the season. Not tonight. Every week since year, this is year five, and the guy doesn't flinch. It's remarkable. There's piercing eyes serving that defense second and ten. Hangs in the pocket again. Fires. Caught at the five. Going two. Just a sale in the backfield. Third and six. Four-man rush. Lamar throws. Caught. First down. To the 48-yard line. Rashad Bateman has made a lot of key catches tonight. Four total. First down. Wilson's up and then drops. And once he drops, there's a void in the middle of this defense. Receiver comes from the left, just kind of sits right there. Lamar Jackson waits to the very last possible moment before he does that. He does that a lot, that kind of jump pass, where he elevates and flicks the ball to the open receiver. Baltimore probably not in a big hurry right now. Four minutes to go. Jackson to the outside. That's taken by Flowers. and Flowers is finally wrestled down at about the 35-yard line. First down. Right there, Lamar Jackson. He's looking downfield, looking downfield, looking downfield. Almost knowing he can sense that the defense had dropped. Nobody was out there. So he just waited and waited and look at his eyes. Downfield, downfield. Knowing he's going to just jump. He sees him out of his peripheral vision. He's got him. And then look at all that space after the catch. gain a 19 Henry Henry turns about a three yard can do an eight yard scamper tackled by Hill second and a deuce he worked through that arm tackle of Davis Gaither there. Guy said, when he runs the football at this stage in the game, he usually gets stronger as the game goes on. It gets tougher and tougher to tackle him. Shook off a couple would-be tacklers. Number one saying, just give us another chance. Second and two. Henry again. Just enough. That's all he needed. Take more time off the clock. Yep. Each team with its full compliments, a timeout plus the two-minute warning. First out here, under three to play. 41-38 in overtime week five. Here we are, 28-28, under three to go. Some great rivalry in the AFC North, of course, in a Pittsburgh ball. I mean, Cincinnati ball wars are almost in that atmosphere. Yep. In the old days, it was more about defense and hitting. Right. You know, just who's the more physical team? Now with the quarterback play, especially these two teams. And now with the play clock at 2. Baltimore takes its first timeout. Ravens have to take a timeout. In the importance of this game, if the Ravens win, they're three games up on these guys. Everybody's forgetting about Pittsburgh. But Pittsburgh still has to play all six division games. But the AFC North figure to be great, and they are again. Yeah, and you knew coming in, Baltimore loses the AFC championship game a year ago at home against Kansas City. And being around them this week, I think being that close and losing, especially Lamar. Lamar talking about with Kaylee before we started, he's possessed, he's focused. And I think it's because he's accomplished everything. He's won MVPs. He may win another one this year. But he hasn't been able to get that ring. And his team is driven right now to get that opportunity. Ravens next two games on the road. Pittsburgh and the Chargers Flowers makes the grab There a flag on the play Ravens backing up. Downfield, offense number 64. It's a five-yard penalty. We'll replay first down. So he takes a peek. Again, run pass option where he can hand it off to Henry. This is where he's going to get downfield, but he decides to throw it. He can hand this ball off to Henry. He sees what he wants because he had leverage. Once this defender got inside, he knew he could throw it to the outside. The problem is it took too long. It's always frustrating to a coach when you have a run pass option and you get a lineman downfield, but the right call is made. so first and 15 three touchdowns in the second half I think they made a few adjustments of the hand I think they did it's gonna be fun to see what Joe Burrow and Chase can do here you never know ain't over baby Seven-point lead. Tucker. His kick. Down to the end zone. Start at the 30. Reminder after the game, JCPenney post-game show on Prime Video. Kaylee interviewing the star of the game. Our gang is here. To recap it all. Lots of recap tonight, too. A lot. I think this comes down to when the offensive line give Joe Burrow time to throw. Joe Burrow lives with these kind of opportunities with the pressure on. No timeouts. Down seven. Chased out. Throws. Can't be one-handed by Gusecki because Owe put the pressure on. second and ten with 144. Interesting decision with Zach Orr, first time defensive coordinator, learning as he goes, doing a good job. Dane Pease, who's upstairs, came over a few weeks ago to help him out. They dial up pressure there. Instead of sitting back in a prevent defense, they dial it up. Get after Burrow. Chase to the right. Burrow. Pressures as he throws. And Chase can't make the grab that time. Matabiki is at three sacks tonight. Forced that issue. Third down. It looked like they may have gotten a hold of Joe Burrow's face mask there on the follow-through. Let's see if it did. Matabiki right there. Yeah, he got his thumb. Yeah, he actually grabbed onto it. It's a no-call, so it's third and ten. Yeah, we saw that in the Viking Ram game. Yeah, we sure did. A couple of weeks ago, no-call. Third and ten. They're going maximum protection. They've got two tight ends in that backfield. Burrow fires over the middle. Nobody home there. So fourth down. Down to one more play. Again, Zach Orr brings the pressure. Burrow had to get the ball out Discommunication You see Vach not making that move Over the middle where they've had so much success tonight Here's play of the game Last guess on fourth down. Burrow fires, and that is going to be caught at the 40-yard line. Wow. And they're going to give him the first. No, they are. They give him the first down. Whoa. Yosevash with the first down. And they stop the clock. You can't challenge anything at this point, but you can upstairs take a look at it, which they're doing. So they'll look at this upstairs. Whoa, where's the ball? Where's that ball when that knee touches? Can't be any closer than that. Terry McCauley, what are you seeing? Yeah, we're going to look for a down-the-line shot. Where is the nose of the ball when the knee touches? If it touches the 40, it's a first down. We haven't seen anything yet so far. It's clear and obvious that would reverse this. By the way, as of now, it's going to stand, guys. Yeah, it looks like he's on the line when the ball comes down. By the way, what an effort with the game on the line to come up with that catch. There's the knee down. That's the end of the play. But where's the point of the ball? If it's on the 40-yard line, it's a first down. If it's a first down, you have a 121. They still have that timeout. And the ball will be at the 40-yard line. Meanwhile, let's note as you look at Jackson, four touchdown passes tonight. Put his arm around the GM, Eric DeCosta. So right now, Lamar Jackson has thrown 24 touchdown passes and two interceptions this season. 24-2. 24-2. Oh, man. Not to mention what he does with his legs. Over five. But look at him. Shaking people. Takes it almost. Good blocks downfield. Big center. Linderbaum. Look at Hill giving you an effort. Andrews. And tight ropes to sideline. Do they give it to Henry? Indeed they do. And he backs his way in. So Henry has now scored a touchdown in every game this season. That is complimentary football by the Ravens. Down 14, second half. Marlon Humphrey, the veteran, rips the ball out from Chase Brown. Heck of a play by him. Roquan Smith, two vets, make the play. and that's all Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry needed. So they get a big break. Goes 31 yards, five plays. Tucker for the point after. And with 4-12 left in the third. Bengals 21. Ravens 14 on Thursday Night Football. Returnable. Four-yard line. Burton. To the outside he goes. Backs up and goes out of bounds at the 19-yard line. That last series, not only the turnover, and Joe Burrow, it takes a lot to get him knocked out, But this is a big hit on a blindside blitz from the corner. Marlon Humphrey. See Joe. See his facial expression. Takes a big hit. And he's back out in the field. But on his way back out. Grimacing when he reaches for that left hand to pick the helmet up. Tough dude. Yeah. Here he is. Nobody knows better than him. He ended his season here last year with a wrist injury. Play action. Hangs in the pocket. Throws. Brown makes that down. And Brown gets taken down there for a gain of six. Under four minutes to play now in the quarter. Incredible what a one play can do to a football game. Down by 14. Game. The crowd out of the game. Bagels in control with the football. Boom. Fumble. Marlon Humphrey rips it out. Roquan Smith jumps on it. Great field position. A spectacular play by Lamar Jackson. And now his place has come alive as they get within that possession. Points off turnovers. Huge. Second and three. Burrow. Stepping up. Fires on the run. Chase makes that catch. Up to the 41-yard line he goes. And for Chase tonight, six catches, 134 yards, gain of 15 here. And once again, the Ravens are going to have to start. They're not getting a push. They actually brought the linebacker Simpson. How many times tonight have we seen, how many times all year, have we seen Joe Burrow with two hands on the football climbing the pocket and like a smart quarterback, he's trying to find number one because he knows he can count on him when he gets on the move like that. Round again. Short game Second down and eight They're trying to make this comeback With their best player On the defense, Kyle Hamilton Has a boot on that right foot Their next game Is a big one, they go to Pittsburgh In ten days One of the most mild-mannered Laid-back, dominated most versatile players in the NFL that plays defense. Second and eight. Brown makes this grab. Comes over about three yard shot. Yeah, with Hamilton, we had him on the Zoom the other day. I'm thinking to myself, this guy's a Mensa candidate. Seriously. He's the real deal. Yeah, his mom really pushed academics and a big part of sports, of course were a big part of his childhood, but playing instruments, getting academics done, goes to the University of Notre Dame, has a brilliant career there, very cerebral, talented player, and what did he say, he has a 6, 7, handicap? 6? Yeah, he's kind of frustrated, he wants to get better. Name something he can't do. Third and two. Four man rush, Burrow chased out, Ferra throws. Chase is there. Yard line. Chase makes stack reps of Chase tonight. 11 catches. 266. He's got a flag down on the play. On the other side. All the way over by the Cincinnati sideline. Away from the play itself. Probably on Van Noy. 53 may have jumped. Offside. Defense number 53 lined up in the neutral zone. Coming five yards, replayed, second down. Yeah, they'll take the call because it makes it second down and five. Trying to get a jump, then he kind of gets caught. He's trying to pull himself back. So 50 seconds. Ball to seven. Burrow flushed out to Brown. And Brown is out of bounds at the five-yard line. So Chase Brown is there. It's going to be third and three. And again, the Bengals still have that one timeout. They'll hold on to that timeout. And with 42 seconds, I mean, again, Lamar Jackson and his group of receivers and the kicker that, you know, they don't need a ton of time. Right now, Joe Burrow is probably not worried about time. He's worried about trying to get the ball into the end zone. And then it's decision time, and if they do, for Zach Taylor. Chase lined up to the right side. Looks that way. Throws that way. Caught! Chase! What a nice touchdown! 38. Well, this is as good as their first meeting this year. It turned out to be. So now, now, if you're Cincinnati, you want to go for two, you want to go for one. What do you want to do here? Whoa, this is... Zach Taylor has been aggressive all night. They're going to go for it. They're going for the lead. I don't want to say the win yet. At least the Ravens are going to get the ball back, and they've got two timeouts. He's got a matchup already. You can see that he wants right there. It's Stevens against Chase. Yep, he's got him all isolated. Take it. That's what you want. Oh, that's interesting. Oh, that's interesting. Zach Taylor came all the way down and called the timeout. Yes. Now let's take a peek at this touchdown. And once again, it's a great throw and a really nice job. But you've got a rookie corner in Wiggins. And you've got a linebacker here in Simpson. And you've got two guys that take the flat. The read is you've got an underneath receiver and you've got a deep receiver. You're supposed to only be reading one defender. But there's two guys that take the underneath receiver. And he's able to go up and over both of them. And a spectacular catch there. by Jamar Chase once again. They wanted to see what the defense had. Saw it. You're right. He had the matchup he wanted. Now they come out in a completely different formation. Totally. The question now. There you go. There goes Chase. He's got it again. He's got that same matchup. Same thing. Yosef Hots to the right side. Chase to the left side. To the right side he goes. Incomplete at the goal line. Washington breaking it up. No flag. And the Ravens are going to pull off a big victory. Down by 14 at one point. Even Orr is shaking his head. Yeah, watch Kosicki, who he didn't look to, but watch how physical this route is. He's got two Ravens on him. They grab a hold of him, and he right away. That's defensive holding right there that they should have called. And here's Hudson matched up one-on-one, again, with an undersized defensive back. Ball's just too high. But I think the frustrating thing, Kosicki right away throwing his arms up in the air, asking where is the defensive holding call. I don't think, I don't think Zach Taylor wanted to give Lamar Jackson an opportunity. The Ravens 15 receptions, 312 yards and three touchdowns. He might want to look him up here on third and sixth. Empty the backfield. Goes this time again to the tight end, Tanner Hudson. Tanner Hudson. He took that snap from center, moving over. I mean, a guy, he's been around one of those journeyman guys who's having a heck of a night. Yeah, and they line him up over here with Jamar Chase, let Jamar Chase get downfield. They widen out. Look at the voids in his zone. Underneath zone coverage for the Ravens, a major problem. And Burrow just capitalizing on that space. Hudson has caught six on seven targets. And after the 27-yard line goes Chase Brown. So Brown, after that heavy workload three days ago, 27 carries, 10 tonight for 34 yards. Again, they also gave some backup help with Herbert. He was in for one play, fumbled, and that's the last time we saw him. Second and five. Brown again. Fighting his way. Ball is out. Ball is out. Ravens think they have it. They do. Knocked away by Marlon Humphrey. He created it. And then Roquan Smith, number zero, comes away with it. With Kyle Hamilton down, the leaders are Marlon Humphrey and Roquan Smith. They've got to make a play. And you can see they're ripping it out of football. Great job by a 44 Humphrey. Knew exactly what he needed to do, attack the football. And the veteran, Roquan Smith, sees it, gets on top of it. That's a free ball, anybody's ball. But it bounced right 2-0 for the Ravens. And now they give Lamar Jackson great field position. Exactly what Baltimore needed. Less than seven minutes to go in the third. So Lamar, after flexing his hand on the bench, fires. No one of the facts. And that'll be an eight-yard gain for Bateman. We go to Kaylee. Guys, it looked like the Ravens head athletic trainer was examining the back of Lamar's right throwing hand and his wrist, but the second that that trainer left his side on the bench, one of Lamar's teammates came up and gave him a heck of a handshake with the right hand, and Lamar didn't flinch. That looked like the best sign to me, that he'd shaken it off. It's a heck of a test. Not even a fist bump. Second and two. Henry. And there he goes. to the 12-yard line. His best game of the night. So the Ravens trying to capitalize on Brown's fumble. Last year, all season long, the Bengals only lost two fumbles all season. This year, six so far. Great block here by McCary. Actually frees this up. Gets him up to that second level. We've not seen him be able to get downhill, build that momentum up. That one he did. There he goes again. and a pass of white shirt is right there to greet him led by Hilton and Wilson 10 carries 40 yards for Henry tonight second and nine got to go back to the end of the 2021 season largest deficit in a home game for this team Justice Hill in the backfield send him out to the right Jackson backing up backing away under pressure and down the sideline he goes Lamar Jackson can he stay in bounds all the way he stopped inside the one name somebody else right now who can do that Nobody. Nobody. And as much as he and his offense have improved with their passing game, when a game is on the line, you better get him down. B.J. Hill, with his little stunt move, has a chance to keep contained. Once he got out, I think maybe some of the defenders thought he was out of bounds. I think that's a response to what Lamar Jackson did. I'd like to see that, but what a play. You talk about an answer? You talk about number nine responding and Jamar Chase making a huge play. 70 yards. So Chase tonight, 238 receiving yards. And Burrow's approaching 400. He's 389 at the moment. Whoa. What took you so long? Right. That took 13 seconds, of which he wasted about five before he got into the end zone. Nick Pearson to tie the game. So at 28-28, last time they met 41-38, highest scoring game of the season. and then we still have 537 left in this one. Now, let's watch Marcus Williams here. Give Bengals all the credit in the world, but he gets caught up in Kosicki, and then he just kind of gets lost. I don't know the coverage, so I don't know if he needs to be back there in center field, but obviously somebody needs to be helping 21 Stevens out. That's a mismatch one-on-one in an island. He needs somebody back there to be able to help him over top. Look at Stevens running. That's why I think they gave up on the play looking around at each other like, Where was my help? Over top. So that time, Marcus Williams, who, by the way, was benched just a couple weeks ago. He responded well last week. But a little bit of confusion, and you do not want to do that in the fourth quarter in a tight game against Joe Burrow. He will take advantage of that every single time. What a throw. And there's that chemistry again with Burrow and Jamar Chase. Well, we bring it up again. I mean, the Ravens with the dead last pass defense in the NFL. This guy, does he get enough hype for how good he is? I mean, when you talk about the elite, elite receivers. He's got, yeah, he's among them. He sure is. Well, we were talking about the Ravens and how much trouble they've had in recent seasons in the fourth quarter holding on to leads. five losses after leading in the fourth time for the second most since 2023. So, again, you're in this situation with a big comeback and then giving up on one play, what amounts to the tying touchdown, setting up for a fantastic match. We got two of the best quarterbacks in the league, two of the best, some of these skilled guys, and they're going head-to-head, tied up 28 with 5.30 to go. Jackson. Look out. Again, avoids a sack. What else is new? He throws deep. And that is picked off by Taylor Britt. Whoa. Can Taylor Britt. And, of course, the Bengals now pending another look at this. Everything, of course, turnover is a review. Does he hold on? Does he keep it? Oh, that hits the ground. Oh, hits the ground. Premature celebration by the defense. They all ran to the end zone. And he'll definitely come back. Heckman effort. Just unable to get his arms underneath the football before it hits the surface. Yep, clear. A couple great looks. And Lamar Jackson lives to tell about it. Got away with one there. Again, he could have taken off. He had positive yards if he wanted to run it. field that it could be passed to second and ten he's with five minutes and 27 seconds on the game clock second and ten at the 30 Ravens have three touchdowns on their last three drives Henry Pulled to about a four-yard gain So third and six As the clock ticks down to five minutes to go in the fourth It's a battle of wills here when he runs the football What a collision with Jermaine Pratt that time with Derrick Henry he's got a lot of shifting a lot of change in a little personnel trying to respond to what the Ravens are wide right and third and six Burrow over the middle caught Brown dives first down to the 41 yard line he goes to Brown tonight 13 carries he's now caught seven for 46 yards on top of that he does a good job here I thought he was going to force it in to Jamar Chase. Look at his eyes. He's already looking out to one. But instead, they took that away. What a good job of holding on to the football, thinking better of it, and then just checking it down. Those linebackers, when he kind of gave that pump fake, they cleared out, and it created that opening there for the check down. Extra pressure. Gets it away. Caught along the sideline. Gisicki making that grab. Picks up about seven, second and three. Washington on the tackle. Such a good job with this tonight. This package that they built with Gusecki and Jamar Chase on that same side. Especially when they get man to man. They're so consumed and worried about Chase making plays. They're off in coverage against Gusecki. So an easy throw there for Burrow. Just for positive yards on first and ten. They'll make it a five yard game. Second and five. Dumps it off. Brown again all night long to Brown on the top of it. That's their running game. That doesn't show up in the stat sheet. That's been their running game all year, and it's especially been that case tonight. Let the linebackers clear out and then check it down. You keep checking it down. You keep doing that. Those eyes start to creep up. Those backers start to creep up. And that's when Jamar Chase has continued to work behind them. So, again, talked about it earlier. Really, really good plan tonight with all that space and that underneath zone coverage. Third and two. Brown back into the backfield. Play clock under five. Going for it all to Chase. Double covered. Incomplete. Marcus Williams back there. Molett is back there as well. Fourth down and two. When you throw a ball like that, you know they're going for it on fourth down. If you're thinking about taking a shot to Jamar Chase, and I love this week what Marlon Humphreys said to the media. He said, you know, I think that Joe Burrow likes throwing the ball more to his guys than me because a lot of times I'm in coverage. He just believes in his guys and his arm to make the throw. That time he just threw it out there knowing if he missed it, he'd give it a shot here on fourth and two. Pass up would be about a 53-yard field goal attempt. fourth and two but the play clock at one get it off again going deep and that's incomplete trying to go to Burton that time and the Ravens now take over at their own 34 yard line 9-24 left in Baltimore on Thursday night Ravens defense Marlon Humphrey rips that ball out, gives Lamar Jackson great field position. The Ravens are able to capitalize on it with Derrick Henry's touchdown. And then how about Wallace? How about Wallace somehow stays in bounds? Two defenders come over a little bit late. He goes the distance. Thought they might tie it up. They missed the extra point, and they're one point away. And maybe eventually see what they can do on this drive. Maybe take the lead. So Jackson takes over. On downs. Ball at the 35-yard line. Wide open. Inside Bengal territory. They go to Wallace again. So the fourth-year guy out of Oklahoma State covered that time by Turner. That's a gain of 20. They motion out, and I think he just ends up getting lost in coverage. Once they motion him out there, they've got him outflanked. They've got one too many receivers. Hilton State up tight on the underneath route. Nobody's there to be able to take Wallace. So all of a sudden, 16's coming alive here. 84-yard gain, 20-yard gain. Fake to Henry. Fired over the middle. That's caught. That's Andrews. He gets into the action. Already in field goal range. First down. Since that turnover where Marlon Humphrey got the ball out of Chase Brown, The Ravens are playing their style of football. They're playing on their terms defensively, more aggressive, offensively, getting first down positive yards, not going backwards with a holding call or a legal procedure. They're doing the right things playing their kind of football. Henry. Gaining nine. All the momentum now with the Ravens tackled by battle. Again, erasing a 14-point deficit. And now on the cusp of retaking the lead. Many times we see this in Tennessee when Derrick Henry was in his prime. Look at the backside blocks here. The left side, Ronnie Stanley. Good job of flushing that down. You trusted Henry's got division. Nice back door cut there by Henry. Second and one. Jackson. And he picks up the first down. Little hand slap for the fan. Andrews led the way halfway through the quarter gain a five first down. We haven't seen that much tonight. It's like Todd Munkin's just holding on to that in the fourth quarter just for the right time to be able to turn him loose on that edge that time he had an escort blocker out in front of him and Mark Andrews and Todd Munkin feeling it right now his quarterback's playing well. Dumps it off. Henry. Short game. Sam Hubbard at 94. In on that tackle. Gain of three, second and seven. A couple wrinkles at this offense. Dropping both of their defensive ends. Both Hubbard and Hendrickson that time dropping out in the flat. Had eight in coverage. Only rushing three. Trying to get him to just hold on to the football. Not always pressuring and bringing blitz. This time it's Hill. Stop. 19-yard line. Hendrickson in on that tackle. Along with Mike Hilton. So a big third and nine here. Hendrickson is, man, he's talented. This guy can run for his size. Not only is a pass rusher, but you can see on that play, the speed that he has to be able to chase down the ball carrier Hill. Hendrickson starting his career in New Orleans. Eighth year in the league. Leading the league in sacks. Third and nine. Pressure. Wide open. Touchdown! Mark Andrews. Glitch and gut burn. 18 yards. Go for two. It looked like a mix-up in coverage. Logan Wilson right here has got to be able to control this crossing route. He in the corner who's working across, that was Cam Taylor-Britt. They almost ran into each other, but clearly looked confused. Nobody takes the big guy. And another perfect throw that time by Lamar Jackson. They sent the extra man. Andrews to the end zone. Jackson's now thrown for 234. Going for two to try to make it a seven-point lead. Von Bell trying to get someone's attention. Jackson. Struts in. Flings it away. Conversion good. And they've erased a 14-point deficit to lead by 7. 28-21. Harbor in Baltimore. Gray's ready to play. He's firing up the crowd there at the base. They love Ed Reed. Go back to those years. Well, it's returnable, but they're going to just down it in the end zone here. Think about Cincinnati. Go back to week five. Here's a quarterback comparison tonight. Both these guys, when they did play in week five, they put up big numbers. What a turnaround for Lamar Jackson. 20-26, three touchdowns, 2-34. Remember, Cincinnati had a lead in that game. They were up 10 in the fourth quarter. Tonight, they were up by 14 in the third quarter. What's interesting, too, is that the Ravens have coughed up so many fourth quarter leads in recent years. And tonight, turning it set on a dime. Burrow going deep, getting free. Chase, look at this. Just like that and chase is gonna get him strut to the one-yard line crowd doesn't like that
