 prep and really just becoming a pro and it's paid off for him this year. Very physical, but you can see the athletic ability and a very costly mistake that time for Joe Flacco. And the interceptions have been showing up for him these last three or four weeks. I'll tell you what, you know, we've been doing a bunch of games recently, which figured to be defensive struggles. Here we go again, 41 points in the first half. In the first half. Is that already taken care of business? Of course it has. That's us. It doesn't matter what game we do. First half. Yeah. Yeah. Bring us to town and away we go. We have a track meet. Everybody can relax at this point based on that part of it. Some can. Yeah. I hear you, man. Some maybe not. Yeah. Here's the kick into the end zone. Two seconds until the two-minute warning. well a flawless first half until that mistake by Flacco and the Browns and like I said you know the seven interceptions in just four games that's the one area that Joe would be the first one to tell you that's part of the game I mean he's he's a guy that's going to put the ball into coverage you're going to have some of those interceptions and that one was just a really good play by the edge player Jermaine Johnson. And this will take us to the two-minute warning on the four-yard pickup by Jerome Ford. This is the two-minute nine teams. He played for a hundred teams. On second down and seven, Flacco throws. That's caught Moore for the last few minutes. He has had to the 50-yard line. He goes. C.J. Mosley makes the tackle. He's now caught five on six targets for 61 yards, and he needs a little extra time. Timeout for an injured player by rule. Cleveland has charged their first timeout of the half. So Flacco now 246 yards through the air. So Moore, you know, with Cooper already down, Njoko's been fantastic in the first quarter. The other tight ends have done well, but this time his main man's become Moore now, and he goes down. We saw Mosley with another hustle play. Remember, he dislodged the football earlier, and this time we have Moore down. Injury timeout. Moore was down for about a minute and a half, went face mask first into the grass, but gets up, comes away, they'll examine him. Of course, the Browns were all there, and a lot of the Jets were kneeling as well because he was a Jet for the last couple of years, played with New York. So a lot of buddies over there, and they'll check him out in the blue 10. Here's Amari Cooper. So he's in civvies tonight. Moore is now out. Marquise Goodwin comes in as the wide out to look for, and Flacco almost gets sacked. There he goes. Throws on the run. Caught inside the 30, inside the 20. Goes Jerome Ford. Still on his feet. Ford looking for the end zone. Gets there. Joe Flacco somehow escaped. Gets rid of it, throws, and then broken tackles all over the place. 50 yards. Joe Flacco is looked at as a guy that's a big quarterback that sits in the pocket. I think what he's proving to everybody is that he is much more athletic than he gets credit for, and he really has his whole career. But these last two weeks, he's reminding everybody what he's capable of doing. Took a club to the forehead from Quinnen Williams and shook it and kept that play alive. Patterson for the extra point. Flacco will be 39 years old next month. Watch this pressure that he gets. He has 296 yards. That's the most yards in the first half of his entire career. You'll see man coverage on the back end. So to the left, you've got that running back Jerome Ford matched up, and now he's in no man's land because there's separation. Quincy Williams loses him in that man-to-man coverage, and what a job of keeping that play alive with the ability to just take this hit right there. And that's Quentin Williams. He shakes that off, and now instead of running, he keeps his eyes downfield and sees Ford is able to get away from Williams and just takes it to the end zone. Everybody remember, they had their backs turned, but what an effort by Ford still to fight to get it into the end zone. Flacco's having a time of his life. He's hanging out with the kids six weeks ago. Now he's headed to the playoffs with the Browns. Hanging out with more kids. Right. Quentin Williams is like, man. As the official comes up here, Steve Flacco. We talked about the fact that he was throwing to Steve and his brother, but he was just keeping in shape. He says the gym has become a major part of his routine, so he was in shape when the call came. Looks right, looks left, looks right again, throws caught up at the 27-yard line, goes Elijah Moore. Tackled there by Sauce Gardner, normally a guy they avoid, and a guy who has to keep his mind in the game because nobody throws his way. Yeah, that's right. And I think this is one of the great stories this year, Joe Flacco. You talk about a comeback story. He's hanging out with the kids, running his Uber, running the kids around and doing whatever you do as a dad. And then he gets the call. He said he was anxious. He's waiting with all the injuries, the quarterbacks. He thought he might get a call. And then he gets that call. And, boy, is he taking advantage of it in this offense. That passes Moore again. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, Joe and his brother Tom, who's sitting up there in the stands right in front of their dad, Steve. They were going out to this turf field a couple miles from their home in New Jersey twice a week for an hour to toss the ball around. Steve was telling us, yeah, he would run five to ten partial routes as his boys threw him the ball. He said when the ball's coming 60 yards at you with Joe Flacco's arm, yeah, it hurts. He had to start wearing gloves to catch him. His hands were getting torn up. Yeah, still third down and three now. Flacco throwing into traffic. They get a lucky break here. Moore makes the catch after Carter almost had the interception. Wow, Carter put himself in position. And Jeff Albrecht, one of the things he told us this week is we know Joe Flacco, because he's around this last year, he's going to put it in coverage. He trusts his arm, trusts his receivers. That's one that they've got to make a play on, right? I mean, that's right in the hands. He played it perfectly. Couldn't be any better position in man coverage. He's unable to finish on the play and give more credit for working back to the football to make that catch. Going to more three times in a row. Pierre Strong is the back now from the 48. Great play fake. Open. Caught to the 20-yard line goes Jordan Aikens, He's a number he thinks he wasn't tackled, so he'll go to the end zone. And the officials, though, will mark the ball at the 20-yard line. So Aikens, the number three tight end. So Njoko having a fantastic night. Now Aikens gets into the action. They're killing him with the tight ends. Yeah, you called it. What a great play fake there. And, again, we always brag about Flacco and how good he is with play action. This is in 13 personnel, meaning one running back, three tight ends. That's a run formation. Great early down play action to sneak the third tight end. Aikens out to get that defense with their eyes in the backfield expecting Ford to run the ball. Strong. Breaks a couple of tackles. You know, it's not the exact parallel, but when you think of Flacco, and let's say, you know, the dream comes true, and somehow someway they get to Las Vegas in February. Again, it's not the exact parallel, but, you know, you think back to when Carson Wentz got hurt in 17 and Nick Foles took over. And the next thing you know, of course, Foles had a postseason of all time, as Flacco did in 2012 when he was with Baltimore. But a little bit of the same. Yeah, yeah. You know, we've got a lot of work to do, but it's fun to start to dream about that and think about that. Right. We're filling time. We're going to take a second down and six. We've got a lot of time. Pass is caught, and fighting his way to the first down mark is Harrison Bryant. So the tight ends, and that's Bryant making his first catch of the night. And Jukov scored five for 132. We just saw Aikens. And they're going to mark it a little shy, third and inches. I'm just so impressed with the versatility of what this offense can do. You get Amari Cooper has the big game last week. They couldn't run the football, so what do they do with him down? They're running the football. They're getting their tight ends involved. Delajah Moore is getting more involved. So great job of adapting by Kevin Stavansky and his staff. Here's your 13th personal again. Who needs the tush-push? Flacco still has enough in those legs to do it by himself. First and goal. He's a large man at 6'6", 240 pounds. And I think the mobility is the thing that a lot of people have probably taken back on how good he's looked. You mentioned how he has a personal trainer. It's just part of his lifestyle. He's always working out. He's not a guy that has to get into shape. He just stays in shape. But still, just adjusting to new players, new teammates, new scheme, and just to be in command the way he is is impressive. Penalty to the first down. They call that one on Dalvin Tomlin. You know the big fella, Dalvin Tomlin? Of course, he went to Alabama. You know his two schools that he was down to? Alabama and Harvard. He's an intellect. He's got his master's in finance, went back to Alabama. He got his, not only his undergrad, but he got his master's as well. Really an interesting guy. And part of doing a really good job of building that defensive line back up with a lot of pickups. About five guys they picked up this year up front. Nick Saban knew how to whisper the sweet nothings. Here's another flag. And that's caught. And getting away and taking it for what would be a first down is Gibson. Who ran that kickback. But we'll get the call from Kemp. And Alex will tell us that Illegal formation Offense No receiver on the end of the line of scrimmage A five yard penalty First down It was the rookie Jason Brownlee Who moved and shifted This is an offense That cannot afford To get behind the sticks Because of that pass rush Of Smith 99 on one side And obviously Garrett on the other They're trying to tell him try to get him up on the line of scrimmage. They knew right away. Everybody knew. Now this is a snap that's going to be taken here by Wilson. And cutting through what would have been blocking is Jeremiah Owosikoromoa. Third year out of Notre Dame. So they try a little trickery here. Wilson had a blocker out in front, but to no avail. He went right around Yeboah, the tight end. Yeboah had really known more for his ability to catch the ball here. He's just trying to make a block out in space and that is a really difficult thing to do against Arusa Kuromoa with his speed. Nathaniel Hackett calling the plays. Simeon is fourth starting quarterback of the season. Fires over the middle and that's incomplete. That'll make a third down and long. You look at Simeon. He was a seventh round draft choice by Denver the year after Peyton Manning won the Super Bowl, rode off into a Rocky Mountain sunset. He was acting in the practice squad that year, has a Super Bowl ring, got into one game. But I mean, he was the guy that succeeded Peyton Manning. Good luck. Yeah, exactly. 2016 and 2017. He was actually 13 and 11 in those two years as a starter. Under the flag. Two men in the huddle. Offense. Five-yard penalty. Third down. Yep. It's been obviously that kind of year for Robert Sala in this offense with the revolving door of players with the injuries. Just hard to have that continuity, especially when the quarterbacks, different rhythm, different cadence. The operation of the whole thing after the fourth play of the season has just been a disaster after Aaron Rodgers went down. Rodgers' old mate Randall Cobb is in the game. Split him out, third down and 16. Banging the drums. Crowd already going crazy. Thrown underneath. Caught by Hall. Grease home. Nice move to the outside. Gets up to the 43-yard line before he's taken down. It'll be fourth down. Ronnie Hickman, who had the intercept in the pick six, makes the tackle. Fourth and five. So that'll take us close to the end of the first quarter. for the quarter for Njoku. Four catches for 113 for Cleveland. Meanwhile, Hall with 72 scrimmage yards in that quarter. With 20 points in the first quarter, tied for the most Browns home game since you go back 1979 against the Cowboys and 2016 against the Ravens. Thomas Morstead the punch. James Prochet Ray will let it bounce, and it's going to get to the goal line for a touchback. Everything going right for the Browns. The center is taking it to 1, to take it to the 20. It's the end of the first quarter, and it's 20-7 Browns on Thursday Night Football. ball. For 20-7, start this drive from their own 20-yard line. And with a nice lead block out in front, Ford picks up five. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS, and Joku has had a big first quarter, if you're just tuning in, so many yards. Opening drive where they scored a touchdown? I think they had an interception and they have gone three and out, three and out, and three and out. And in danger now falling even farther behind the way things are going for that Cleveland offense. Here's Morstead. Prochet sets up at his own 20-yard line. Perse waiting for it Colesford makes the fair catch at the 18 yard line with four and a half to go in the half what a story Flacco in the bracket with throwing as an open man at the 18 yard line and about a seven or eight yard pick up there by Harrison Bryant TJ Mosley makes the tackle second down and a yard just one more thought on Kevin Stefanski his ability to adjust to his quarterback. You know, you had Deshaun Watson. They were more spread out, more empty, more trying to create space, use his legs, use his arm. And then, you know, you had other quarterbacks like P.J. Walker. You had to adjust to that, D.T.R., Dorian Thompson-Robinson. And now Joe Flacco, more under center, more run the football, more play action. To the outside, Hunt. And he picks up a first down, tackled there by Mosley and Williams. So that right now puts Cleveland at 289 total yards. Yeah, and I just think when you look at NFL offensive coordinators and schemes, I think at any level, that's the mark of a great offensive mind is the ability to adjust on the fly to the personnel that you have to work with. And it could change week to week. It could change tonight. I mean, you just have to be ready to adjust to what you have to work with and put your guys in the best position to succeed. and he's done that as well as any coach, in my opinion, with all these injuries as anybody. He's right up there in the conversation for Coach of the Year, the job he's done. Meanwhile, you got a necktie tackle there, like Clinton Williams getting his arms around the ball carrier, Hunt, and a flag. First little foul, face mask, defense number 95, It's a 15-yard penalty. First up. And that is Quinton Williams. He and his bro. Playing on the defense. You're pretty clear right there. Turned his head around. Caught some 15. So that moves the ball out to midfield right at the 50-yard line. So the Jets have given up about as many yards tonight in the first half. As I mentioned before, they've given up per game this season. This is going to kill their defensive rankings. From the 50. To the outside goes Ford. We were kidding with Salah last night. We said, you know what, you're out of the playoff hunt. What are you going to do? Obviously, everybody's talking about playing for pride and their jobs next year, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I say, hey, one thing you can talk to about the team is that defense, You guys turn in a stellar performance tonight. Maybe you jump over the Browns in some of those categories. Uh-uh. Not after this. Not after Joe Flacco in this offense putting up these numbers. And I don't think anybody really expected, especially with Mari Cooper down. I think we all expected maybe, you never know in the NFL, right? You know, like you'd think the Jets would be in trouble offensively against this Browns defense. But maybe a low-scoring game. Browns offense continue to shine. Off-play action. A little flip there. And then it's picked off. That's Jermaine Johnson is going to take it all the way to the end zone. So in dire need of something great to happen, the Jets get just that. Just before the two-minute warning, as Johnson, the second-year guy out of Florida State, one of the first-round picks last year, takes it to the end zone. Watch him elevate, come down, and then get back up and knock that ball into the air. What an athletic play. By Jermaine Johnson at 6'5", 265 pounds, and then the speed to run away from Nujoku. So just when we start celebrating what the Browns are and what they're doing to this defense, Jermaine Johnson with an answer to get them really back into this game. First interception of his career, first touchdown of his career, 37-yard return, extra point. We can put the kibosh on anything, right? Start talking about something that's fixing it all hell breaks. Yeah, and, you know, these defensive linemen have been making plays all year. Jermaine Johnson, really known with his ability to set the edge. They brag about what he did after his rookie year, went to another level with his nutrition and his pick overall back in 2017. And like so many of these defensive ends that are known for their ability to rush the quarterback, I always stand what stands out to the elite ones, like Miles Garrett is what they do against the run on the early downs. You know, this is a mismatch against Becton. He's going to win this battle all night. And that time he just is able to separate, keeps his eyes in the backfield, and uses leverage and power to get off that block. Third down five now. They go empty. They go five wide. Hall's back in the game. And they're going to bring him a little bit inside and then throw it over the middle to him. Inside the ten. To the end zone he goes. Touchdown. Garrett Wilson with a nice block to lead the way. So each team down the field with alacrity. Applauded by Aaron Rodgers. 21 yards and a touchdown. Unbelievable. And another man-to-man beater. This time we saw it with the Browns when they scored, and this time we see it. Look at the offensive line. This is a tough thing to do against that group. But we talked about Brees Hall, what he can do out of the backfield. Nice, soft hands. Obviously, when he gets out in space, he just bounces off those would-be tacklers. But what an answer by Nathaniel Hackett and this Jets offense. Yeah, 53 scrimmage yards for Paul on that drive. Here's Zerline for the extra point. That's good. And so we played a little bit less than seven minutes. Got a shootout. Totally. We're in Cleveland. We'll figure the two. Sends it down through the end zone. This is what we're talking about in terms of these two teams starting quarterback. They bring Ford back into the backfield as they start this drive. Blacko rolling out, throwing on the run, and almost picked. Tony Adams was right there. Might have been out of bounds had he held on to it, tried to get it that time to Harrison Bryant, the backup tight end, second and ten. Quentin Williams, with great pressure up the middle, forces him off his spot, and that's what you've got to do, right? You cannot give up the big play against Flacco in this offense. Make him drive and be consistent. Look how powerful Quentin Williams is, able to get through Posick right there and flush him out. And Flacco's in this zone these last three weeks, and the Jets are trying to come up with a way to get him out of it. And Big 95 with a great play there to disrupt things. Second and ten. Inside handoff. Here's Ford again. Room to Rome. Gain of 17. Run down by Quincy Williams. So Ford, of course, he's in the spotlight, has been since early in the season. After that shove injury, he's already carried the 30 yards tonight on four totes. And when you get upfield like this, it really gives the Browns, that John Franklin Myers, it gives the Browns some nice blocking angles and allows them to climb up to get to C.J. Mosley. So the defensive end, you know, they're trying to get upfield, trying to think about rushing to quarterback on second and ten, and a good call there by the Browns to run it. Ford again. Nice run again. First down again. Ethan Posick, the center, leading the way. Jerome Ford. Who they want to be, because that sets up their play-action game. Pierre Strong is now the running back. Play-action. Flacco falls down. Ball is out, and he's able to recover it. But through the years, it's been one of his trademarks. He is so good, not particularly on that plane, obviously not, but so good with play action. Yeah, the mechanics that he has, you can just see he's very comfortable here. Comes through the fake clean. He just loses his footing. And there's the rookie right there who's been playing a little bit more. Will McDonald almost gets in there and has a chance to take away the football. So Browns get behind the sticks. This is where the Jets can really apply some pressure with that front. loss of 8, stricken in 18 4 man rush pass caught on the Cleveland side of the 50 and taking it right to the midfield stripe is Njoku, C.J. Mosley making the tackle so with the tight end already 3 grabs tonight 70 total receiving yards if you remember on that opening drive they got behind the sticks on that drive as well they were at a 3rd and 15 remember they hit Njoku for that big catch and the yards after the catch. And then in second 11 on that first drive, they hit Njoku as well. So he is really stepping up with Amari Cooper down. Kareem Hunt, the third down back. He flanks Flacco, stays in to block. Pass is caught. Njoku off to the races again. Inside the 30, inside the 20, out of bounds, inside the 10-yard line. David Njoku. Backfield to get Hunt. Remember, they've been running the ball well. That time, they go backwards. And the crowd loves it on fourth and four. They're going to go for it. Come out five wide here, including Hunt to the outside. Flacco throws, and that is incomplete. Intended for Tillman. D.J. Reid covering on the play. So they had a first down at the 13. They had a second and two. Come away empty, and the Jets dodged that bullet. 13-7. Got to step up. Here's the rookie, Cedric Tillman, with a chance down in the red area. He's got inside leverage. He's just got to finish that route. This is part of Joe Flacco and these receivers still growing together. Only been around for five weeks, and you can see how frustrated the veteran quarterback is, not afraid to state his case and what he wants, but a big stop by the Jets. For sure, they had a fourth and four, and they went for it. Now they start this drive. Nice run here. Powering his way for close to nine yards goes Grease Hall to set up a second down and short. Running down to about three minutes to go in the opening quarter. The Jets having the ball for the second time. Their first drive, 75 yards, six plays. Jim Schwartz, the defensive coordinator from the Browns, has brought a lot of energy to this defense. And one of the things he prides his defense on is running to the football. What they're seeing here early is the importance of the backside hustling because Brees Hall's liable to take that football anywhere with the vision and instincts that he has as a runner. Second and one, Simeon getting out of trouble and picks up the first down, gets to the 19-yard line, got away from Miles Garrett. From Miles Garrett, who's been a sackmeister throughout his career, doesn't have a sack in five weeks, and that has a lot to do with all these quarterbacks that are getting rid of the ball in 2.2 seconds. That and a tight end. Conklin tried to chip him, but he's just too quick. He goes right around him with the speed. But I'd tell you, it was impressive. It was Trevor Simeon feeling that and sensing that and realizing he had enough yards up the middle to get that first down. So he got out of farm's way. Play action. Byers picked off at the 30-yard line. Runny Hickman. All the way. Touchdown. the Ohio State rookie with the pick and the score so the Jets got away with their first turnover but not this one and it's 19-7 what a job by Ronnie Hickman that's the one spot we've talked a lot about the Browns and the injuries. But talking to Jim Schwartz this week, he said, boy, I've lost some leaders. Grant Delpit, Rodney McLeod in that back end that have really affected us. We have Juan Thornhill that's back tonight. He's missed three games himself. And Ronnie Hickman's had to emerge, and man has he. Extra point this time is good by Patterson. First pick of the rookie Hickman's NFL career. 2-0-1 to play in the first. Back at 30. Hickman, who's from Ohio State, and he's got his eyes on another Buckeye, which is Garrett Wilson. The Jets are trying to get him the football. So Hickman knows he needs to cheat that way and read the eyes of the quarterback. Ball's going to come out fast because of Garrett. So a really good job of just using his instincts in a feel. The thing that really impresses me is when that ball is intercepted, the effort to take it to the end zone. But how about the Browns defense sensing an opportunity to put that into the end zone, picking up some big blocks to lead him to that goal line. Well, here we go again from the five-yard line. This is Xavier Gibson as they change runback men. After the earlier fumble to the 39-yard line, he goes, and the Jets will take over at that spot. You always like to see how a quarterback will respond to a mistake like that, especially a guy that's still trying to show his teammates, They'd say, I can be the guy. Turns it over. Not only a turnover, but it's a pick six. But he's got some moxie and some confidence for a guy that's, you know, been through what he's been through in his career, been in a lot of different systems, played for a lot of teams, has some confidence about him, the way he carries himself. 38, and that's blown dead right from the get-go. Who's first? Each side, of course, points to the other. Ultimate arbiter here is Alex Kemp, who gathers with four other colleagues. Defense number 94. Having a Pro Bowl performance in one quarter. 43 yards. He's already gained 113 receiving yards. And that was another third down, this time third and 12. and C.J. Mosley actually turned, almost anticipating that Njoku is going to be coming to him. Watch him right here I got him And then he just loses his footing again And Najoku has that speed to just run right by him First and goal just inside the 7 line Through the middle, into the end zone. Kareem Hunt. Push-ups for the touchdown. His ninth rushing touchdown of the season. I don't know if the execution could be any better up front for this offensive line they have not been able to run the football they've heard about it from a lot of people they're down to their 4th and 5th offensive tackles but watch this block by 75 Petonio, what's he able to do on that trap? it was a quick hitter, downhill in a hurry but that block there opened that up and got Hunt downhill for that touchdown Bradley Patterson for the point after. Just signed. And that one is no good. The Hopkins hurt. He's not active tonight. Patterson comes in. It's 13-7. This is supposed to be like so many of the games we've been doing recently, low scoring. Instead, it is wild and woolly in Cleveland on this third. Down the field, Jerome Ford for a touchdown. And thought the Jets, how would they respond early in this game? Brees Hall had a great opening drive, running and receiving. and then Hunt finishes off their second drive for the Browns overcoming some third down conversions and they were able to punch it in for another touchdown. Two for two. Field a little damp so some of the guys getting their cleats changed. Meanwhile this kick is fielded at the three yard line by Israel Vanaconda. He loses it! And the Browns are there and the Browns think they have it and they do! Mike Ford Jr. Comes away with it. Ivana Konda, the rookie out of Pittsburgh. Dropped it. It looked like 48. Matthew Adams may have got his left hand on that to knock it out. In fact, he did. The ball is loose. He got all those white jerseys around it. and they're able to secure it and get the ball inside the red zone. What an effort by Adams. Loses his footing, gets back up, gets his left arm on the ball, and knocks it loose. 53 is eligible. So this drive starts at the 12. We've had three drives in the game so far, all 75 yards, all resulting in touchdowns. Now from the 12. Flacco. Play fake. fires caught at the five and then gang tackle with a flag coming in there. Cedric Tillman makes that grab. Rookie out of Tennessee. They may get the big tight end here for offensive pass interference. Harrison Bryant. They've had a couple rubs that have worked in their favor. Good routes that ended up being picks. This time they may get him and push the Browns back. There is no flag on the play. Second out. That looks good. I think this is what they were discussing anyway. 88 Harrison Bryant on the inside to our right. Just trying to run a route. Affect the coverage. And they end up picking up the flag. Not calling an illegal pick there. So a gain of eight. Kareem Hunt is now in. He already has one touchdown tonight. And on the second and two. The fake to him. Flacco looks one way. He comes back the other way out of the end zone. Intended that time for Tillman to make it third down to two with 4-0-7 to play in the opening quarter. I think the thing that has stood out to a lot of us watching these Browns team with Joe Flacco is the confidence that Kevin Stefanski has in him. You know, it doesn't matter the situation. You've got a veteran guy who's been there and done that. They call him a kind of a calming influence on the entire team. They just believe that 15 will make the plays. And so they trust him with the play calls. regardless of where they are in the field. Very much the demeanor he affected in all those successful years with Baltimore. Whoa, stuffed in the backfield that time. Kareem Hunt, Glennon Williams, number 95. Got him in his tracks, fourth down. And he's going against Batonio, who's one of the best guards, if not the top guard in the game. He's been dealing with some injuries, but that is a great battle in the middle right here. Goes back and forth, but that's the power and the quickness to be able to get off that block and get into the... First and goal. Rolling and throwing. And that pass is incomplete intended for Elijah Moore. So Flacco is now 12 out of 17. He's thrown for 300 or more yards in the last three games of the night. Well on that pace of 211. Yeah, you can just tell that he continues to settle in and get more and more comfortable. I thought last week against Houston was in his four games, the first time that it just seemed like, okay, the light has flipped. The switch is flipped for him, and he is making some plays and feeling good with the reads. It looks like Nick Harris is in that backfield again, lined up there as a fullback, offset to the left. Second and goal. On the ground, probing, nothing. Jerome Ford stopped there by Jermaine Johnson. So the Browns tonight, Kirk, they're doing this against a defense that right now would be third in the league allowing 295 yards per game. And the Browns tonight have already run up 271 yards. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. I mean, as frustrating as this year has been, obviously, for the Jets and their fans, the defense is the thing that makes you get excited about what they can become next year when Aaron Rodgers gets healthy and they build some pieces, add some pieces around him. Flacco on third and goal. Throw in court. Elijah Moore for the score. So Moore becomes the main man on the X-Jet. Catching a touchdown pass from the X-Jet. And here he is matched up one-on-one. He's got the cushion. Watch Flacco work to the left and just kind of falls off of that throw. gets it out early enough to give Moore enough room to be able to work towards that left boundary. Great job of setting up Reed, who's very twitchy, very athletic corner, but the route that time by Moore and a great throw on time by Flacco, nothing he could do could defend that. Patterson, extra point is good. So against one of the best defenses in the league and with an offense that's minus Amari Cooper, it's 27-7. We'll be right back. Cam Cameron helps us out. He worked, obviously, as an offensive coordinator when he was at Baltimore. They took him out to work with Tom House. Tom House works with thousands of quarterbacks. He said he's the most efficient with his mechanics other than Nolan Ryan. Tom House works with pitchers. He works with quarterbacks. He works with everybody. He works with Joe Flacco. He looked at Cam and he said, I don't know what to tell you. This guy is as good as I've seen. meanwhile simian gets sacked back at the 18 yard line you know who well garrett is right there so he hasn't had a sack in five games and here he comes and when you leave him one-on-one this is what's going to happen he's right in front of you watch this move to the outside little stutter step I mean, this guy is as big as you can think he is. He's 6'4", 275 pounds, and moves like he's 240 pounds. Just a mismatch. And you know how excited he is to finally get another sack. Not going to keep him down forever. Nope. Second and 17. Deflected. And fortunately, it falls incomplete. Newsom that time put the pressure on. Got a hand on it. Third and 17. And Simeon is starting to feel the pressure from this Browns team with his big lead. They're just coming after him. They know that he's in, they are in a mode to get the ball out. Watch him this time. He keeps working him out. Now he goes back inside, and that blitz right there from Newsom allows him to get his hands. Here he comes late, disguises it. You think Jim Schwartz right now is dialing a few things up, the defense coordinator for the Browns. Somebody pounding on that trash can. I think the Astros must be in town. I'm sorry. I got it. Out to the 34-yard line. Xavier Gibson takes it there short of the first down. Simeon right now is catching the snap and getting the ball out. And it's a good decision to get it to Gibson, but going to come up short. Since that's Nick Borden playing the fullback role. He's the guy, of course, who last week was going to lose his job. He's thrown back on the practice squad. He's going to activate Aaron Rodgers. It turned out to be just fine for him. Yeah, and a really good call just to get the ball out quickly. The defense does not adjust. It kind of lulled him to sleep because Bowden just hadn't been out there getting very many opportunities. That time on a third down, a critical third down, he slips out into that left flat, and the corner had slipped inside. So, nice, easy, quick throw. Roger said he wanted to make sure that Bowden was taken care of. They activated him, doesn't lose any money. Grease Hall is right there. Gain of two, it'll be second down and eight. So you've got Simeon 15 at 21, 165. The tough thing in getting the yards downfield is that Rush gets in so quickly. Puts a lot of pressure on the receivers and the tight ends to be able to win against man coverage and get downfield. So it's a lot of quick throws. through the middle nice run man I'll tell you about Brees Hall not a lot of space there but it just takes people with him you asked me in the open what do you see for the future everybody's excited and bracing for Aaron Rodgers to come back hopefully healthy but we talked about the pieces he'll have around him and I think people start to see after the ACL his rookie year what Brees Hall can become as a runner and a receiver and what Garrett Wilson and that gives him two legitimate young pieces that can really flash within this offense. Yeah, he's almost half the team total tonight. Third down and issues. Keeper. Should be enough. Simeon, unaided. First down. Helped up by Garrett. Kaylee. Well, guys, as we were talking about those pieces the Jets have in place, Reese Hall told me every week he's got confidence that he's the best player on the field, and he appreciates that Garrett Wilson has the same approach. So these guys are challenging each other at every opportunity. Like when Wilson makes a catch, Hall will be there to say, you could have made the next guy miss and scored. And when Hall has a big run, Wilson will tell him, you could have cut back and scored. Hall says they are always hyping each other off, and that's why they go so hard. Yeah, they're going to turn it around. Those two are key pieces, obviously, in a flag. Against the Jets. All start. Offense number 19. Five-year-old penalty. That's Irvin Charles, who's barely played tonight. And they'll take him out right off the bat. Again, the red orbs to give you that alert. time the AI all over that blitz the threat again it's not predicting who's going to blitz it's just saying that's the most immediate threat that the quarterback should be aware of and that time he ended up coming so a little flinch there that was just enough for us down in 15 to the outside nice move but again the field does him in Jason Brownlee Not a lot of slipping and sliding tonight, but enough rain here yesterday. Fields covered and all that, but the field a little damp. He's going up against Denzel Ward, and I was really impressed when I talked with Jim Schwartz. I don't know if I've ever heard him more excited about this defense and its potential despite all the injuries, and he said, Denzel Ward, all the years I've been a coach, as an assistant head coach or coordinator, he's the best corner that I've had, and I think that tells you kind of a big statement of his potential. Second down and 11. Simeon to the outside. Not caught there by Garrett Wilson. Had to lunge for it. Couldn't handle it. A little less than a second less than three minutes to play here in the third. At that time, they've been doing this a lot. They showed Mann pre-snap. And just trying to affect the mind there of the quarterback, Trevor Simeon. And they dropped to zone. And that time, Thornhill almost got out underneath that route. A lot of barking. A lot of noise. A lot of banging of the middle plate. Third and 11. Simeon has that. Knocked back to him by Zedarius Smith. He's had a quiet night until now. Feed me, he says. We've seen Zedarius Smith on the offense's right. We've seen Miles Garrett on the left. We've seen that match. Instead, it remains 17. One more ping. That time it's Shelby Harris. It's up being returned for a touchdown and then a blocked field goal attempt. And the ball never really seemed to get up into the air. A low kick. Looked like he hit the ground as much as the football there. He took a divot. Yeah. And meanwhile, Shelby Harris, that's the fifth block kick of his career. Maybe the easiest one ever because that was low. Barely had to get it off the ground. But five block kicks for that man. This Jets defense did not allow a 300-yard passer in the last 33 games. Pretty good odds that Joe Flacco will end that streak. He needs four yards. I think he'll get him. I think he will. I think he's got a shot here. Maybe right here. Well, not quite. Denied. David Bell makes the catch stop to the line of scrimmage. Kaylee, what you got? Guys, the Browns tell me that Elijah Moore has now been ruled out of this game with a concussion after we saw him go face mask first into the dirt in the second quarter. That means, look at this. the Browns are down their top two wide receivers in Elijah Moore and Amari Cooper a lot of productivity right there you see Amari on the sideline but again because Elijah has been diagnosed with that concussion we won't even see him back on the sideline they're out but right now you get a little toss here to the outside and only getting a yard or two is Ford and now the ball is out and they are going to say that Jordan Whitehead ripped that ball out of his hands Jordan Whitehead who started the season with three interceptions on opening day as he goes to the sideline down goes forward and the question is now was the touchdown when he had control so all doesn't have to be challenged because all of the turnovers get reviewed and they will take a peek at this and the Jets are waiting on the sideline to see what's going to happen on the field that is ruled or called as a fumble. Now this play is under further review. Close. Very close. Very close. That's why Terry McCauley makes the big bucks. He'll have to examine this one. Yeah. We haven't heard him, Terry, in a few weeks. We need to get him in the break. Tackle goes back to work and cannot break the tackle and not pick up the first time. So David Bell made the catch. Tackle made there by Tony Adams, and that creates a punting situation. Yeah, with the injury to Moore, and we talked about Cooper all night, him not playing tonight, you're going to see more of Goodwin and Bell. They're going to have to step up and make some plays. So fourth down now, Matt Hawk, who they just signed because Corey Bohorquez, he's also hurt, so the place kicker and the punter both got hurt last week. new guys for both disciplines this week and Hawks kick is out of bounds at about the 33 yard line that's where the Jets will take over down by 17, a little less than 8 to play, back in 30 17 this drive starting at the 33 yard line Simeon rolling, throwing that's caught, spinning Tackled to the 39-yard line, Xavier Gibson. You've seen these defensive alerts pop up, and for people that are not familiar with it, the red orbs that are circled, that doesn't identify somebody that's automatically going to blitz. What it does is it gives you an idea of the fan at home to see what the quarterback and the offensive line, what they think are the most immediate threats to attack the line of scrimmage and potentially blitz, whether it's against a run or the pass. Second down and four here. And that tackle is made in the backfield coming up. The stop limits. Ron Harmon owns three Super Bowl rings as a member of three championship teams with New England. Third down. He is a guy you and I had him last year when he was with the Raiders. He has bounced around. And because of the injuries that they've sustained on the back end, they picked up a veteran. and he's got plays with clean eyes, as you saw right there with that quick reaction. We're going to be hearing that all night. Yeah, there's the culprit right there. There you go. Paul DeJondon, third and six. That's caught. Can he get the first? Yes, he can. That's a nothing lead, and then all of a sudden Washington caught him and looked like Washington was going to win the game. Another terrible day for the Jets. Worth coming until Zerline came in. Save the day. Yeah, there was a headline that said, Heimlich maneuver. Oh, man. The way their season is gone, didn't you think? That would have been some choke job last week. But Zerline, who kicked the Rams into the Super Bowl with a long field goal in the NFC Championship game against New Orleans in the 18th season, tries to put this one through from 46 yards. and he does so that will have the lead I guess in a manner of speaking no math major me but I know it's 34-17 stay calm down by 17 they're going to get the blow low to start the second half Riley Patterson sends this one down to the 5-yard line. Xavier Gibson past the 20 and out of bounds at around the 29-yard line. Time now for tonight's journey being brought to you by Hyundai. Career high in the first half for Flacco, second most by any quarterback in the first half of the season. Mahomes 321 in week 7 for KC. And then you have a whole bunch of the cloudiness. And a malfunction. And you can't land at that airport tonight. That's the highest scoring first half in the last four years. Of any game. From the 29-yard line. Jets with Hall. To the 30. From the 33-yard line. It's second down and six. Nice opening. Hall again down the sideline. And he's having a nice night. So for him tonight, he's carried the ball a total of seven times for 63 yards. And he has 33 receiving yards as well. Nice job there on the right side of that offensive line winning those one-on-one matchups. And then Owusu Corolomo got to the outside. And he just opened up a nice vertical seam for Hall to get upfield again. A big game. It's averaging about nine yards a carry. Exactly. 7 for 63. Give it to him again. Cuts it back. Nice moves. Picks up about 7 yards. It looked like he'd be stuffed behind the line of scrimmage. Tackled there by D'Anthony Bell. Watch him again. We saw him do this in the first half about how the play is designed to go to the right. He senses the defense overflowing. Bang. He immediately aborts it. You saw Darius Smith right in his face. He wasn't blocked. So he's able to cut back and get away from that traffic and show you the vision and that strength. That's what they want to see from him. Take that next level of showing that power that he can run with. He gets a breather here. Hand the ball off this time to the Bonaconte. You know, a lot of people don't know that much about Bree's fall. Jets don't play that much on national television. But you think about the fact when you saw him in college. I did. He played at Iowa State with Brock Purdy. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine what those two did together in Ames, Iowa. They took a program where they were really trying to build a winner, and they were a doormat in the Big 12, and they became a champion. And it had a lot to do with the ability, what he could do, catching the ball to the backfield, running the ball, and obviously what Brock Purdy could do leading a team. Back in the game, third down in inches, and we have a timeout. Jets, their first to the half. This will be a 30-second timeout. So Aaron Rodgers, of course, is here tonight. Done for the season, obviously. Hope to maybe get back by the end of the season. Did you set the game clock at 12-24? Trust me to there, because you don't want to take a timeout in this situation when you don't have to, especially third and inches. You're down by 17 points. Yeah, down 17 every timeout. If you are able to put points up on the board here, you can get back into this game. You need those timeouts as you get into that fourth quarter. If they do cut into this lead and make this a close game, we'll remember with 12.24 to go in the third that they wasted one. third and inches breaking a tackle in the backfield there goes Hall again he got away that time from Miles Garrett Garrett coming across the line with all those moves picks up a first down on the game of 10th you imagine being Gibson and trying to make this block right here that's a Tough thing to do for a wide receiver for anybody to try to do, but it's good to be 220 pounds as a running back and be able to pull out of the grasp there of Miles Garrett, and he is just a glider, isn't he? He is a beautiful runner. Yeah, 5'9", 189. You don't want to see Garrett coming out. No. From the 31. Play action. A little dump off here. Paul. short game. We go to Kaylee. Well, it feels like this offense was listening to my halftime interview with Robert Sala, guys. The answer to every question I asked him was, we have got to play better. When I asked how his offense could find its rhythm again, or how his defense could slow down what Joe Flacco and Cleveland would do, that was his answer. We have got to play better, but this offense does look like it's making progress here. Well, that could be the theme of the season. Yeah. And tonight, It doesn't change. The ball needs to be in the hands of the difference makers, which is Brees Hall and Garrett Wilson. Second to nine. Fired over the middle, making the catch at the 10-yard line, Jason Brownlee. And he'll set up a first down and goal. Tackled there by Thornhill. Well, this is a young, undrafted free agent. It's 6'2", 198 pounds at a Southern Miss. that they have a lot of promise for what he can become. How about going up against Denzel Ward, one of the top corners in the game, and it's soft coverage, man-to-man coverage. He's able to get to the inside, and that is a perfectly thrown football on time by Trevor Simeon. Brownlee had a touchdown last week against the Commanders. First down and goal now. And stopped in his track this time. Couldn't get his footing that time this fall. Bell is there for the tackle. It'll be second down and goal. Yeah, they're rotating all four safeties with the entry still to Delphid. He's not available with that groin. So you're seeing Bell and Harmon when it's more about defending the run, and they'll rotate Thornhill and Ronnie Hickman, and when they're expecting more of the pass. Jets in the red zone. As you see, they get inside the 20. Not good. Dead last. Only get in about a third of the time. Go, go. Sillian throws incomplete. That's Gibson, the intended receiver, covered by Martin Emerson. So Hackett will send in the play against Jim Schwartz's defense on a third down and goal. And Miles Garrett again against Becton one-on-one. There's the bend we talk about when he goes to the outside. It's so tough on a big offensive lineman, let alone a guy 370 pounds, to try to get down there as he gets that low and still impacts without the sack, still affects the quarterback. Third and goal. Simeon fires and not caught at the goal line. Wilson looked like he might have a chance to pull it in. Thornhill covering on the play. Rodgers expresses his dismay. Fourth and goal. That's not a surprise that they tried to get this ball in. But you'll see Ronnie Hickman, 33, who's going to try to come over and help out. So you had outside leverage by the corner, Newsome, because he knew he had help from Hickman. That is a tight window for Trevor Simeon. It had to be a perfect throw to get that in there. So now it's fourth down and goal. looking over toward the bench. The play clock goes all the way down. The layup game, offense, five-yard penalty. That's better than taking a timeout at this point. You've already got the field goal unit in, so it's going to cost you five. It's still pretty much a chip shot field goal. Yeah, they only had ten guys out on the field. So it's like Carter Warren ended up coming out to give them 11 after the penalty. So a 31-yard attempt for Greg Zerline. His 12th season in the league. Thomas Morrsted to hold. Block. So the Jets come away with absolutely nothing. on a kick that would have made it a two-possession lead. He's on the back side right here. Again, the play action, and you're going to move him, just move that launch point just a little bit. He's a big receiver or a big quarterback, but he's got these big targets downfield. He can go up and over the linebackers. Look at that rotation. Gets a good snap on the football and just clears C.J. Mosley there over the top of that zone coverage for a nice completion. And doing it against one of the best defenses in the league. Jets leave the top in almost every category. Flacco throws. Caught. Can he get into the end zone? And it is a touchdown for Jerome Ford. Three minutes 50 seconds picked right up where they left off last week and they got 36 in Houston and it 7 to nothing and we wondered who would step up and Nojoku gets him downfield but watch this matchup right here 22 Adams trying to stay in man-to-man he runs into traffic because of that route by Nojoku man-to-man coverage down in that tight low red area opens it up nicely for Flacco to make that throw to four. It will be 7-0 with a new kicker. Rodney Patterson booting it through. The assistant Hopkins is hurt. So his first kick as a Cleveland Brown is an extra point. And just like that, trying to clinch that playoff spot. Gone after week 10, opening the door for Flacco. Patterson kicks off, and the Jets will come out to the 25-yard line. and they're going to take a look at a Browns defense that right now is first in the league in total yardage allowed. First as in best. Best in pass yardage. Twelfth in points, tenth against the rush. And especially dangerous in their eight home games here. They have been the best in the league in that category as well. Tough to move the ball on them, and this Jets offense has struggled to move the ball against most teams. Trevor Simeon, their fourth starting quarterback of the year. Canceled off for a three-yard gain. That is Brees Hall coming off of a game last week against Washington where he had both more than 90 yards rushing and receiving. If the Jets are going to hang in this game and move the ball, it's two guys who are going to have to make plays and win some one-on-one battles. As much man-to-man as we'll see tonight. 17, Garrett Wilson obviously on the outside. And as you talked about, Brees Hall, not just running the ball, but catching the ball out of the backfield. Second and eight for Simeon. Gets rid of it quickly and puts it right on the money. Garrett Wilson threw it over the top that time. Owosu Kuromoa put the pressure on. And Garrett Wilson making the catch. Defense number 95 was lined up in the neutral zone. That penalty's declined. The result of the play is a first down. That's Myles Garrett lined up in the neutral zone. Of course, the penalties declined. It's a gain at 22 yards. And there's two things here. Number one, Garrett Wilson against Emerson is a matchup the Jets want. They want to hit that when they get one-on-one without a safety over top. Wilson will win that battle more often than not. Second thing is, which is big tonight for Simeon, ball got out fast. He does not have time to hold the ball against Myles Garrett in his pass rush from the Browns. On the ground looking to get into Cleveland territory, and he does with a lot more. A good run there as Thornhill finally runs Brees Hole down after he picks up 25 yards. This is a really nice job of running. We just talked about Brees Hole and what he can do. Watch the block by Lakin Tomlinson. He works the double team, then climbs up to the linebacker. Really good job there. And with a back like Brees Hall, and I think the league is still learning about 20 and how good he can be. Garrett goes out wide, which allows him to get underneath that. He is very sudden for a big back at 220 pounds. Two carries for 27 already. A little toss back to him. Touch it back. Finds a little bit of an opening. Takes the ball down in the 20 yard line. I tell you what, Curry. You look at these two opening drives. You think, wait a minute. These are the best defenses in the league, huh? Right. Right. Right, and the fact that Simeon's able to hit a nice pass, get his confidence going a little bit against his very aggressive, athletic Browns defense, and then you get Brees Hall going back-to-back runs where you really see his patience and vision and ability to accelerate and break through those arm tackles. He gets a rest. And Bonaconda is in there as the running back. They give it to him, and he is stuffed at the line of scrimmage. It's Miles Garrett. Great career, seventh year. He was the number one in Cincinnati. Jets deferred after winning the toss. Greg Zerline, last week's hero, kicking off toward Pierre Strong. And off we go on this 44-degree night in Cleveland. And Joe Flacco sitting at home until a little over a month ago. Thought his career was probably over. Phone wasn't ringing. 3-1 in his last four games. He's won his last three. Ten touchdowns. The only Buccubo has been a lot of picks. Seven in those four games. Look about how many yards in the production he's had in his last three games on his three-game win streak. It's been incredible. So a man who was with the Jets in a backup role for three years starts off here. They run it to the right side. It's a gain of five yards for Jerome Ford, who has taken over in the absence of Chubb after week two as the number one running back. There is Amari Cooper coming off a sensational game. Set the all-time Cleveland Browns record. And that's saying something with this franchise. 265 receiving yards at Houston. Heard his heel low and is out. They go no huddle on second and five. Flacco is terrific on play action. Throws. Bullseye. 44-yard line flag comes in. That's Elijah Moore making the catch. Referee is Alex Kemp. And it's going to go against Cleveland. to the displeasure of this crowd of 68,000. Passer for offense number eight. It's a 10-yard penalty. Still second down. The reason he got such separation on D.J. Reid is at the top of his route, he extends his arms, and there's a little push at the official catches. It's a good clean route until the end right there. Just a little push to the back. He had Reid turned. And, you know, from that angle, it's really hard to see. But in fact, the hands got up, touched, made contact. That's why they made the call. Flacco knows more. More came over from the Jets as well. A little stream there, and it wasn't going anywhere anyway. Jerome Ford drops it there, so incomplete. It'll be third down and 15. What we've seen from Flacco since he's stepped in is they want to be able to run the ball, which they've not been able to really do these last three weeks. But the play-action pass game, and they've been going to Amari Cooper. A lot of those big plays last week were off that play-action look. So with Cooper down tonight, you've got to think Cedric Tillman will get more opportunities. Elijah Moore, who we already saw. Others will have to step up, obviously, with Cooper down. They go empty here. Third and 15. That's caught up at the 25. Picking up a lot more, getting the first down, taking it into Jets territory. David Njuku, the tight end. So the need is 15. He got 36. David Njoku. He's right here. And the Jets a lot of times when he's third down and long, they're going to rely on the front little twist game. But look at this. This is yards after the catch with Njoku. He's as good as there is in the NFL at this tight end position. It really seems to be playing with more and more confidence, playing with Joe Flacco and getting these opportunities in space. And you can see when he has room to run, the big fella can go. 76 catches on the year for him. That's Nick Harris as the fullback in this set. Running back is scored. Swings to the outside. Has room. Cuts it back. Picks up very close to a first down. D.J. Reid making the stop there. Boy, this crowd is... They can't wait to celebrate. No doubt about it. And I think this run game gets this crowd excited. This is an old school football town. And as much as they're enjoying watching Joe Flacco, they know if they're going to make a run, if they do get into the postseason, they need balance and they need to be able to run the ball to take some of the pressure off of Joe Flacco and not be one-dimensional. Well, you think running, you think Cleveland? What do you think about Jim Brown? That's right. To the outside again. Now trying to cut it back, but the Jets are there to smother him at the line of scrimmage. Four tackled there by Tony Adams. Second down and 11. As much as we're talking about the Browns, anybody who has watched the New York Jets, I think you especially had to learn to appreciate what the Jets have faced on this side of the ball defensively. I mean, they're as good as there is in this league, and they have been handed a pretty tough set of circumstances this year. And every week they're out here playing hard. Every week they're not pointing fingers. They're playing with a lot of pride. And every week the consistency has been remarkable. Yeah, Robert Sala already told, along with his GM, Joe Douglas, they're back next year. As Flacco rolls to his left, fires another strike. That is Njoku, setting up a first down and goal. So he's caught passes for 36 and 28 on this opening drive. To the catch again, one of the best in the entire league this year at making these plays and being able to get off a tackle. You see 166, the yards after the catch, over-expected. That's served most by a tight end in a season since going back to 2018. So I don't think he's close to being done with Amari Cooper out not playing tonight. So that 10 catches, 25 or more yards. Here's Ford. Escapes the tackle. Picks up the first down. Takes some jets with him. Gets to the 35-yard line. Got away from Solomon Thomas. You almost feel like Stump Mitchell, the running back coach, and his entire offensive staff had to really challenge this offensive line and these backs. Jerome Ford, look at this. They've had some moments when there's been some good blocks, but that was Jerome Ford making a great play, showing you some outstanding balance to be able to shake off that would-be tackler there and then get upfield for the first down. There's Stump Mitchell right there, great back in his own right. Pierre Strong is now the running back here. And that's Solomon Thomas Who was the man who missed the tackle on the last run Officials get together And the call is against Defense number 94 The 5 yard penalty That running game Making a lot of yards to the outside Of course on the inside You talk about your guard, center, guard Trio You've got Petonio and Posick and Teller, and that's about as good as it gets in the NFL. And I think with Jeff Albrecht, that's his biggest fear coming into tonight. You know, with Quentin Jefferson down, Al Woods, they lost to an Achilles week six. They just don't have depth in the interior. First and five. Flacco rolls, throws, caught, and Joku. There he goes again. He loses the ball at the 40-yard line. Scramble for it at the 40. The Jets think they have it. They do. Yeah, C.J. Mosley knocked that ball out. I think he's tired of seeing 85 run all over the field. The leader from the Jets' defense catches up to him and brings the hammer with him. Ball gets a little bit loose. Watch right there. I mean, that is C.J. Mosley just had about enough of seeing 85 out in the open field. That is a great job of running to the football and a nice job by the Jets of eventually getting on top of that. I don't know, maybe Mosley got on top of it as well. Ball bounced around. He's chasing it. He eventually got it. Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. 57 gets it. Meanwhile, that was 19 more yards before the fumble, so 132 yards for Njoku in a quarter and less than two minutes. So the Jets get a break. Can they make it pay off? Paul to the outside. Taken down after a game of a couple. Sione Taki-taki making the stop there. It'll be second and eight. When we talked to Debrek after their first drive, it was, we said in the open, for them to score. Garrett Wilson's going to have to win one-on-one, and Brees Hall's going to have to make plays, and that's what we saw in that first drive. Since then, they've kind of lost that rhythm. I wouldn't be surprised to see them try to find those one-on-one chances if they can get Wilson loose. short drop quick throw and there is wilson and the ball is coming out at the end but now they say incomplete never had it in the first place so it'll be third down and eight you got ronnie hickman in there been involved in a lot of stuff a lot of guys coming up with grass in their face mats and there's that matchup again with emerson and even though he's covered he's in pretty good position. You're talking about with Garrett Wilson. He's got great ability to elevate. Incredible body control. And it has the ball skills to be able to make that catch normally. But that time Emerson just never gave up on the football. You could see it come out. Third down at eight. To the outside goes the pass. And he cannot get away. Garrett Wilson. Necktied there by Greg Newsom. Fourth and five. I think you could make a strong argument that Greg Newsom and Denzel Ward and Martin Emerson as a trio might be the best on one team in the NFL. Newsom on the slot is really taking over. Has the length and the instincts. You know, he moved there last year permanently and this year is starting to really become one of the top slot corners, I think, in the league. Morse that's first punt was 57 yards This is a line drive kick That goes out of bounds And they will mark this I tell you what There have been some amazing stories this year Backup quarterbacks and all the rest But this could wind up topping the list So 34-14 125 five. Like we mentioned at the very onset, Flacco was saying the other day he was prepared to wrap it up. Didn't know exactly what he wanted to do, other things in life. Tending to five kids or helping. Of course, Mrs. Flacco has something to do with that as well. Yeah, and I think his big message was I wanted to get calls. I wasn't I couldn't control it. I wasn't getting calls, so I was preparing just in case. I saw a lot of injuries to the quarterback position, so I was preparing myself and finally got a call. Well, Garrett came across the line and that'll end that play. And they said his workout, from what Kevin Stotansky said, was very impressive. Defense number 95 was on the lead to the quarterback. That's a five-yard penalty, still first down. And to Kaylee. Well, guys, remember when you were in high school and people were just cool? Amari Cooper told me that's the best way to describe Joe Flacco. He said he's just a cool cat. Now, mind you, Flacco was in high school when Cooper was in kindergarten. But his seniority on this team, as you guys have talked about, is clearly valued by the younger ones. Simeon throws, caught. Were you a cool cat in high school? I was a quiet cat. You were? Yeah. Well, I was a cool cat. You were cool. I was cool. Millard Fillmore was in the White House, and I was a cool cat. What can I tell you, man? Second and four. Through the 31. Simeon throws. It's caught up at the 40-yard line. Garrett Wilson makes the catch and is ridden back there by Martin Emerson. So under a minute to go now in the half. So week 17. Trudge is on. Browns without a team in the late 90s and came back in as an expansion team. The old Browns going to Baltimore as the Ravens. From the 36-yard line, that short pass is caught here by Tyler Conklin. Brown's doing a really good job with Jim Schwartz mixing up coverage from man to zone, just trying to disrupt the timing of Trevor Simeon and these receivers. Second and four. Simeon keeps his eyes downfield, and that is Conklin making the grab at the 33-yard line, and timeout is taken by the New York Jets as Elijah Moore gets walked back into the Cleveland locker room. Timeout. Good to see him up and walking off the field. Chance to be evaluated. What a play, by the way, on that last play by Trevor Simeon. And he sensed that Miles Garrett with another inside move. And when he went to the inside, he realized, hey, I can get outside. I can run away from this pressure. And then he throws his ball and just throws it and brings his tight end back to him. Conklin was running down that left sideline, but the football brought him towards the boundary. So great job of keeping the play alive, number one, to avoid the pressure. And then the location of that football on the run. Simeon 9 of 13 110 yards 4 man rush Flag thrown And we'll get the call from Alex Kemp With 19 seconds As the hole started to slip down Beck did it be Caught for a holding is having a hard time when he's one-on-one against Myles Garrett. He leads the league in a category you don't want to lead the league in, penalties. You hear that crowd reaction? Garrett, sometimes he doesn't get the sack, but he gets the hold. It's basically like a sack. And by the way, he still got to the quarterback. Look at the bend. Look at that bend by Myles Garrett. It's 265 pounds. Tough year for Becton He's allowed 11 sacks Taking those 14 penalties That is Gibson who makes the grab here Cutting across the field Gets it inside the 30 And gets tackled inbounds And now with one timeout They have to take it Sooner than later To at least set up a field goal attempt And they take it with 3 seconds Timeout Jets Their third and final 30 seconds So that'll bring in Zerlice It was funny. It was a great headline in one of the New York papers last week. Remember, the Jets had that 20. Tip and incomplete. So we still have one more play. Alex Wright. You have to wait for great, you know, you just have to be patient, right? This crowd was totally, completely into it. Right from the good go to the line. Big fella's ready. Yep. I don't know what he's ready for, but he's ready. Final play of the game, in all likelihood. Caught. That's going to take us to triple zeros. and takes the Browns to the playoffs Chanting your name, yep. They played together, obviously, at Baltimore. He said, I can't believe you. In Cleveland, going to the playoffs. Mosley. Well, the Browns making a lifetime memory for a lot of people tonight. 95 against 77. Now it's 99 against 77. and he also is able to win, reacting quickly to the quarterback stepping up in the pocket. Two big sacks last week in Houston. So it'll be fourth down. He's telling us it is a clock problem. So, for the moment, time is standing still at Cleveland Brown Stadium. Mm-hmm. Maybe he'll keep it on this time action. Crowd doesn't like it. They want to start celebrating. Right, they're ready. Again, winning them in the playoffs. We're going the second time in 21 seasons. and this is what they're talking about. So the clock never started. Play clock, of course, starts after the play is over. Going to reset the play clock. 2.20 on the game clock. 2.20. I'd say we're in Tin Pan Alley, but nobody would know what the hell I'm talking about. Except Kelly Hayes. Fourth and ten. With Thomas Morristette, long-time New Orleans Saint kicker. It's a little backspin on it, and it's fair caught at the ten-yard line. So, Cleveland take over there. A little pushy Chevy going on with 2.07 to play. Run, that's for sure. You can see what he can do when he's got a little bit of room. It's a heck of a trap here by the left guard. Betonio is able to open that up downhill for Kareem Hunt into the end zone. Been doing a good job of giving Joe Flacco enough time as well to be able to throw the football. But, man, it all starts up front for any team. And tonight, the big boys up front for the Browns playing great. Drive starting at the 10. play action. Flacco throwing into a lot of traffic. It's incomplete. The crowd looks for a flag. There is none. Pass intended that time for Njoko, who had that gigantic first 17 or 18 minutes of the game. Pretty quiet since. Second down. And watch how tight this coverage is. This gives an example of Joe Flacco and the trust that he has in his arm. C.J. Mosley, 57 turns. He's expecting this ball to be thrown. You got Sauce Gardner out there. Two different defenders, even Quincy Williams trying to get in on the act, but he still tries to squeeze that in there. The crowd reacting to saying Sauce Gardner came in over the top there, but that is a good no call. Second and ten, Flacco throws. A little back shoulder action is incomplete here. You've got Reed covering on the play, intended for Cedric Tillman. These defensive backs for the Jets without Cooper and now Moore out there, They are really getting tight and really challenging these backup receivers, these younger receivers. How about that left hand by Reed that time at the last second getting in there to knock that ball away. Great timing and great coverage by D.J. Reed. He's down to the rookie, Cedric Tillman. Markey's Goodwin's been around. Haven't thrown to him yet. David Bell is a second-year guy. Go empty here. We've got Flacco retreating to the end zone. throwing to high flag thrown though. That pass intended for Tillman. And of course if it's against the Jets and it appears to be automatic first. Holding defense number four. That's a five yard penalty and an automatic first down for Cleveland. That's Reed so on a third and ten. The flag and the big call against New York. Actually at the top of the round he's in good position. grabs him there, grabs him there. The reaction, the retaliation from Tillman was after he was already held and the penalty had already been called. There's Quentin Williams getting in. Flacco right away saw that defensive holding call. So it was automatic first. Yeah, Reed trying to make it look like offensive interference. Meanwhile, to the 20-yard line here goes Jerome Ford for a pickup of about five. So Ford tonight, he's carried the ball 12 times for 64 yards. Those guards They get around. Again, I think if you study the NFL offensive lines that are out there, you look at Petonia and what he can do, and Posick at center, Teller at right guard. When they're healthy, they've all been banged up. But when they're healthy, that's as good of a trio as you'll find in this league. Just been trying to deal with it. They're playing with their fourth and fifth offensive tackle with the injuries that they've had to Wills and Conklin and now DeJuan Jones. Second down and five. Ford again. Dropped it. Picks it back up and gets smothered. And the crowd now wants a flag for a little extracurricular. It's Bruce Hector, number 98, who came in and stopped him. No flag. They keep going to that pole lead play with those guards. They're running it to the right and to the left. That ball was in. It just looked like Ford maybe just somehow lost his focus. That ball came out. That hit there by Johnson got the reaction. So third down and seven. Half a minute to go. In the third. Flacco. Pumping. Throwing and that's incomplete. So, what started out as an off the charts night has cooled down. But the defense has done enough good work. To hold the Jets scoreless in this quarter. Yeah, they tried to move him away from some of that pressure. They're just not getting any separation at all in the back end against the coverage of the Jets. Nowhere to go with the football. Matt Hawk into punt. Punted for the Colts last year. Xavier Gibson. Standing at his own 35-yard line. Good kick. Gibson from the 28-yard line. Finds a little bit of room. Finds a lot of room. Takes it back near midfield. Four seconds remaining in the third. To Kaylee. Guys, we're going to love this. There were big tears and even some tears. A part of the fabric of this community and have been for over half a century. Meanwhile, what will be the final play of the quarter? You've got Gibson taking it for a gain of nine. And that will take us to the fourth. 34-17 after a scoreless third. Back after the hard-tongued Reese Hall. Picking up what should be a first down. His grand finale might have been better than anything we've seen so far tonight. I don't know how old that kid was, but he crushed me. I'm telling you, what, 13? Oh, is that what it is? Okay. He's been practicing. Oh, yeah. To the Jets. Had a lot of opportunities but have not been able to cash in. Both teams scoreless in the third after a 51-point first half. That pass is caught. A little short of the first down. Garrett Wilson makes the catch. Denzel Ward with the tackle. It's our next-gen stats powered by AWS. Miles Garrett, the reason you're seeing Trevor Simian get the ball out fast is because of 95. Whether it's against a run or the pass, they're getting penetration and getting after this quarterback. To the outside, to the inside. Look at this, 1.91 seconds time to pressure as a team. That's the third fastest average as a team the entire year. That tells you about the Jets' offensive line, too. Yes, it does. Second down and one from the 34-yard line. And no play. Got a false start. False start. Offense number 77. Five-yard penalty, second out. Well, McCoy Becton, I don't know. Here's a guy, you know, they have such high hopes for him. Number one draft pick out of Louisville, fourth year. But, you know, tons of penalties, tons of sacks allowed. Yeah, and I think anybody new coming in tonight, that was the biggest question, is what's Nathaniel Hackett going to do to even the playing field with the tackles that he has, especially with Becton on that left side matched up against Myles Garrett? So second down and six. Simeon just throws that one into the ground. Too much pressure. Nobody was open. Third and six worth coming. The thing that is really I think it impressive for this Browns defense is their defensive line is so good for Jim Schwartz And he believes in turning them loose Give them freedom to be able to get creative. And I think because of that, they've been able to overcome some injuries on the back end, especially at safety. Third and six. Flacco throws. Cutting the cross. Making the grab. You called it. Njoku, but right there for the coverage was Tony Adams. I mean, he had such a great first quarter. I think he went over to the bench, and Amari Cooper said, Hey, slow down, man. I set the record for the team last week. 265. Let me have it a little bit more than a week. Yeah, and that time the Jets anticipating that potential shot that he might take that. So Adams just in really good position of man coverage to give up the reception, but make the tackle so they get the ball back. Good job with the three and out there by that Jets defense. Again, Matt Hawk. Xavier Gibson sets up at his own 20-yard line. Running the clock as far down as they can. And the left-footed kicker sends one down to Gibson who floats over. Grabs it at the 14. Yeah, good call. And he's paying us a visit in the booth here as the Jets go to work here. And that's Hall who gets stuck. behind the line of scrimmage look at that again a little for a mower right there taking them down for a loss of four they just keep coming after him keep doing a good job of creating that that pressure well he doesn't want to think about hanging this coming up you've heard it you've heard a three in the booth yeah there you go what do you thing. He's got a headset. He's got the whole thing going on here. Eating my candy corn, doing the whole thing. Dog on the loose. Second and 14 to the 24-yard line goes Reese Hall. Look, this is not Alpha. What are you seeing them? Milk phone. Yeah, milk phone. There you go. You know, I wasn't the dog guy until you showed up with this guy. I know. I know. He won you over. Totally. I smell kidnap you. Didn't give the defense a chance to match up. Re-snap the ball. So you're going to re-snap it now because they snapped it too early. Didn't give the defense a chance to get set third down and nine now. 613. Jets from their own 24-yard line. That pass is caught. Pull. and again he gets done in by the grass. So fourth down. They did a really good job, though, with those linebackers of being able to run to the football and just leverage him. Taki Taki on one side and Owusu Karamo on the other. There's really nowhere to go, even though he did lose his footing. Yeah, they kind of compelled at this point. Yeah, you got to do it. Keep him in their own territory. Still needs six. It's fourth down. We have Simeon getting away. Can he get to the marker? Very, very close. Tackle and inbounds. Fischl comes in. Looks like we're going to spot him a little bit short of what he needs. Jeremiah Olsen-Koromoa stops him. Fischl's gather at that spot up at the 33-yard line. Is it a turnover on downs, or does he get it? Oh! Oh, close. That is very close. Much closer than I thought. Yeah, you see the marker right there. It's about that knee where that knee touched where the football was. Going to put it down. Going to bring the chain gang in. And he does not get it by that much. A couple of lengths. Well, that was a heck of an effort by Simeon. The way he's been pressured, knew that he had to pull it down and just try to make something out of it. And I think that knee touching right there prevents him. If he would have laid out and just went airborne, he's able to come up with that first down. But the leg ends up dragging and prevents him from being able to extend that across that first down marker. He is short. unless the Browns take over in Jets territory, and they can start to milk the clock here as well with a two-touchdown advantage. Well, you know, with Benny coming in as the third guy in the booth, it reminds me, the first-ever Monday night football game was played in Cleveland at the old stadium between the Jets and the Browns in 1970 with a three-man booth, Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell and Don Meredith. In the year? Yeah. And we have video of everything. Keith Jackson, second down and two. I was in that era where you used to beg your parents to stay up to halftime of the Monday night football game. See the highlights with... Oh, yeah. Howard. Yeah. Well, Howard, you know, Howard, he knew... He knew enough. Yeah. That, you know, he could go all the way. It was just a way to string out that whole play, you know. Yeah. He would go, you know, for 12 seconds. He could go all the way. But that's really well done. Thank you. You know, the thing is, you didn't have any highlights back then. That was your only way of watching highlights. That's why people, you know, loved it. I'll be working the Holiday Inn Lounge tonight. You nailed it. You're exactly right, Kirk. How many years you worked with him? I did baseball in him for about eight or nine years, yeah. How was that? It was interesting. It was interesting and it was complicated. some of the greatest stories of all time came out of that second and seven this crowd right now they're ready to let it loose they got the Joe Flacco chant going come a long way from driving the kids around six weeks ago one regular season game to go in the playoffs third down Joe Flacco's night right here that first half was insanity yeah I mean ends up throwing for 296 yards everything was going it was really an extension for what he did last week against Houston just making every throw having time they're running the football here he is creating it's 6-6 2-4 he's going to run instead keeps his eyes downfield throws a touchdown pass to his running back Jerome Ford, about as good of a first half as you could hope for. They've just been holding on here in the second half offensively. It's just hard to believe to see him in that uniform. If you're an AFC North fan, you look at Joe Flacco, you think, especially as a Browns fan, all those losses that piled up when the Ravens and Joe Flacco would beat the Browns. And here he is at 38 years old in the dog pound trying to clench a chance for the Browns to get to the postseason. On top of the fact that Cleveland moved to Baltimore. Right. So there's animus toward Baltimore to begin with. Hunt. Set a fourth down. Under three to play timeout. Hey, we want to. Mark Teitelman's done a fantastic job as our producer this season. His rookie season at the helm here. Pierre Moussa, terrific job. And my thanks as always. Malibu, Kelly, Hayes, and Wimbledon, a million years. George Hill, a million and a half. Chris McNutt has been up here. Audrey makes us look great. Audrey Mansfield. Ray Stein takes care of a lot of other stuff for us. Wade Junko got a lot of good folks that we couldn't do without. Yeah, and my buddy Darren Brown has been helping me out for a long time. And new addition this year, Tony Granari, who's been amazing, helping me out on Thursdays and also on Saturday nights. And Kenley Williams, kind of my right-hand guy with me everywhere we go. So, yeah, you're right. Just a crew that you're blessed to be a part of. Great group to travel with. And our pregame folks as well. Yep. Tons of fun. Riley Patterson now. 33-yard field goal attempt. And bangs that one through. That's some noise. And neither team has been to a Super Bowl. Neither the Browns nor the Lions since the Super Bowl began back after the 66 season. The Browns will be an interesting team. Very. The defense is outstanding. They can always have that ability. If they can get healthy up front, they can run the football. Flacco can get hot with that play-action pass. Looks like potentially they could set up with the AFC South champion, who they just played Houston. Who knows who's going to end up winning the AFC South with Indy and Jacksonville and Houston all fighting it out, tied there at 8-7. But the Browns are dangerous. Like we talked last week when we were in L.A. about the Rams and the NFC. With Stafford and the way they're playing, they could be a tough out. You'll be playing your best in December. The Rams certainly are. Backhanded catch. Grabbed here. Gained about nine yards by Kenny DeBoa. His first catch of the night was target of the night. Second and short. So the Jets will wrap up their season in Foxborough against New England. Next weekend. And that's incomplete. And for the Browns, we should point out, too, minus Cooper and minus Moore tonight. Both guys hurt. But they do have the extra time ten days before the next game. Yes. Yeah, at zone coverage there by Garrett Wilson. Second and fourth, again, a six. They sent five. Pass incomplete to the 20-yard line. intended for Gibson to coverage that time by Emerson, third and four. They can't go to Wilson every time. We've seen Conklin get some opportunities, Brownlee, and now he's trying to get it to Gibson who has great quickness, tries to set him up to the outside. Ball's thrown a little bit behind, and it allows the length of Emerson at 6'2", 201 to be able to get in there and knock it out of there. Third down and four. Josh Fore Pass caught And close to a first down Goes Tyler Conklin He's right there And they're going to mark it a little bit short See you've got another fourth down coming up Taki Taki making the tackle Yeah once again you see the changeup From Jim Schwartz there With that coverage And they're going no huddle Come right to the line the sneak, and no, it doesn't look like he got it. Jordan Elliott, 96, is right there. So the Jets have had so many opportunities. And again, come up with zero. Just a microcosm of their season, really, for this offense. Plenty of opportunities. I mean, you go hurry up, you try to catch his defensive line, napping, you try to get off the ball quick, and instead look at direction, this line of scrimmage. It goes backwards. Good job of penetrating there by Jordan Elliott. Trying to catch him. Didn't want him to make any substitution. Run a sneak, no good. Blow another opportunity with 10.53 left in the... And if one picture will sum up the season, that's it. Says it all. That picture helps to sum up the Cleveland season. And that's another picture that, you know, what can I tell you? Team that's 6-9. Such high hopes on opening night. Full of crazy things. Rodgers gets hurt. They still won the game. Right. They beat Buffalo in overtime. They're looking at the play again upstairs, but we didn't see anything that would indicate he picked up the first. But what do we know? The highest scoring first half in four seasons. Right. And zero points in the second half. They might be looking at... The runner did not make the line to gain, however... Defense, 12 games. There were 12 men on the field on defense. Whoa. That's a five-yard penalty, and it's enough to give New York a first shot. Whoa. Whoa. So as they were hurrying to try to get the ball snapped, the Browns are trying to get off the field and it ends up costing them. They make a great play. It looks like Darius Smith was trying to get off the field there. It was. So they still have some life. The press is having a tough time salting this one away. It looks like an all-time route to begin with. You don't mean 17 is still at a wide margin, but... Simeon, deep drop throws, caught. Gibson, stuck before he gets back to the line of scrimmage. tackle made there by D'Anthony Bell it'll be second down and 12 Bell is really comfortable coming down near the line of scrimmage second year player out of West Florida played zone that time just kept the ball in front of him chased it down got an injured Jed who's down right now meanwhile we'll take a look at the remaining schedules now in the north so you've got Cleveland with that one game left you go to Cincinnati and you've got Baltimore with two games left with Miami and Pittsburgh both in Maryland It is remarkable to think about what we talked about earlier. This team is 10-5 on the verge of clinching, going 11-5 with everything they've dealt with. She's got Xavier Newman, right guard. and that pass is almost picked off but it's fourth down now Martin Emerson had in his hands dropped it he has four interceptions this season four and seven eighths and I think the reaction from Garrett Wilson he wants P.I. watching the inside Newsom number zero right there I'm just surprised that we didn't see a call on that play right there to give them the first down I don't know how that's not P.I. So fourth down. Jets. Thirteen and a half to go, and they'll go for it. They need six. Play clock at zero. Did they get it away? Before the ball was snapped, the lay of game. They did not. That's a five-yard penalty. So fourth down. and now you've got a fourth and 11, and so Salah's going to send in the punt team. Yep, that play didn't get in until late. I think they were trying to get the right call there on fourth down, and by the time they broke the huddle, they were down around five seconds. So Morstead's fairly busy night will continue with his fifth punt. Prochet back for the Browns. Calls for the fair catch. Makes it at the 9-yard line. 13-29 to go in the fourth. Browns trying to clinch a spot in postseason. Up by 7. He was at one of our games in wherever it was. Meanwhile, you've got this drive beginning here. Pierre Strong gets pushed back. You know, if you go talking to the players and the coaches this week, I think they care so much about him as a player and what he's meant to them. You know, this is Pierre Strong. So Strong would be like the number three back. Jerome Ford became the number one back. Kareem Hunt third down back. And touchdown maker scored his ninth of the season tonight. And this guy has seen some action of living. Yeah, and just when they look like, okay, we got the over the Chubb thing. Now we got Deshaun Watson going. When he's 5'0, when he comes back and beats Baltimore in an amazing game on the road, then he's been dealing with his shoulder. Then he's out for the year. Then you're dealing with trying to figure out, is it going to be Dorian Thompson-Robinson? Is it going to be P.J. Walker? You've got injuries on the defense. You lose both your starting tackles. And they just keep finding ways to win games. And then Flacco comes over and gives them a huge spark at 7-5. They've won three in a row, about to be four in a row. And the ball comes out, but the whistle had blown. So they're going to call him down by contact there for a game of four. It'll be second down and six. See if that ball came out before he... Yeah, ball's out. Yeah. Ball is out. Sure. And then what about the recovery here? Jets. Jets. So you got Quincy Williams with the pop to force it out. And then Jermaine Johnson, who scored a touchdown before, on the interception. And now he's certainly going to get, if that call was he was down by contact, challenge for sure, or they'll even reverse it if Kemp gets the call from upstairs. After discussion, the ring on the field is a fumble recovered by the defense. Okay, there you go. So originally they were calling it down, now it's clearly, clearly, without question, a fumble recovered by the defense. well it's a good job of getting the call right Jets get great field position it's Jets defense once again finding a way to try to help find a way to get back into a game and win a football game they already had an interception for a touchdown with Jermaine Johnson now they give Trevor Simeon in this offense the ball at the Browns 35 yard line the whistle is blown otherwise they could have had after the recovery a possible touchdown by Jermaine Johnson who took the ball into the end zone. Which would have been his second of the night. Could have, would have, should have. Instead, they have the ball at the 35-yard line first down. Simeon. That one may have been tipped, but it is complete. Shelby Harris looked like he may have got his hand up there. We already saw him block a field goal attempt. This time it looks like he got his hand up there, but still the ball had enough on it to get out to the receiver. Wilson. Harris. Hands up. Good job of sitting right there. He comes off and the Jets now go up to the line of scrimmage with a second down and 12. Take a new one into the tent. Billy Turner been around a long time with a lot of teams. is in there. Flag thrown. Stopping the play. Ball start. Offense number 66. A five-yard penalty. It's the center. That's Joe Tipman. Rookie out of Wisconsin. I really like what he's done stepping in for Connor McGovern. You know, there have been a few silver linings to some of these injuries that they've dealt with. And one of them has been Joe Tippman. Like I said, he is a rookie and has had to learn on the fly this year. That little head turn. Yeah. Calling that a lot. Yep. So second out of 17 now. Simeon throws over the middle. Can he get away? Oh, he cannot. Tackle it about the 25-yard line by Sione Takitaki. Third and 16. Imagine being a quarterback, Trevor Simeon, when the average rush is 1.91 seconds. And you've got Myles Garrett in the backfield almost every snap. and you're Nathaniel Hackett and you're trying to call the plays. That is a tough ask for any quarterback or any offensive coordinator. Now he's got to come up with something that gets not all the 15. It's four down territory, but most of it anyway. Simeon starts to take off, gets stripped from behind by Alex Wright. And that'll make it fourth down and 15. and they move Zedarius Smith inside here next to Miles Garrett so you're going to get a chance to get a one-on-one matchup with Alex Wright and this guy is coming on. He really is. You think about three outstanding pass rushers. They have that on the edge with 91 now in his second year at a UAB. Great quickness in length. His fourth sack of the season. Here's a 44-yard attempt by Zerline whose last kick was blocked after he took a divot on the kick. And this one is good. So the Jets on the 4th and 16 off for 3 to turn it into at least a 2-possession deficit. 34-20. Right after the game, it is movie night. Prime Video brings hit movies like Gran Turismo. Based on a news story, from the theaters to your home in one app with one password, Prime video. The skating going on downtown Cleveland on this Thursday night where this crowd is looking to celebrate. I mean, even if they lose the game, they still have a great chance to make the playoffs. Yeah. But they want to see it happen at home tonight in the final home game of the year. There's hardly anyone who's left this stadium. They want to be here to witness it. Only the 25-yard line. Flacco play action Flacco throws that's incomplete so Joe had 296 passing yards in the first half and 7 in the second half and on that throw right there they get aggressive they go play action which he loves he's got his rhythm and that time he just air mails Kareem Hunt went right over top of him there so you know I think with Kevin Stefanski he's looking at you know you don't want to Just run and work the clock. You're up by a couple touchdowns. Still wants to stay aggressive. Still wants to get back into that rhythm that they had going in that first half. But keep in mind, Elijah Moore goes down with that injury. Amari Cooper not out there. This offense has not been the same without Elijah Moore. Run a draw. They stuffed that one at the line of scrimmage. Hunt. Stopped there by Jermaine Johnson. So third and ten. Eight and a half to go. In the fourth. David Njoku had that big first half and haven't heard much from him lately. He's got five receptions, 128 yards. Like I said, all that coming in the first half. I wouldn't be surprised here with these younger receivers if they try to find a way to get him matched up and he can win. He's off to the right, flexed out just a bit of Joe Flacco. He had 113 receiving yards in the first quarter alone tonight. And really, for the Browns, I think part of what they do against Cincinnati is going to depend on the results of the Miami-Baltimore game. If Baltimore ends up winning that game, there's really no need to rest up against Cincinnati. It's almost like anybody that's ailing, you rest them up and get ready for that first round. Right. Third and two. False start. Offense number 77. Five-yard penalty. Third down. Of course, if you win the division, that's huge because you do get a home game. And if you don't, I mean, Cleveland right now with Baltimore likely to win the division. Yeah. You know, Cleveland would have to go on the road. But, you know, the one time that they've made the playoffs in the last two decades, they went on the road. We did that game on a Sunday night in Pittsburgh, and they had a 28-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. Yep. Pittsburgh made a game of it late, but that was during the COVID years. Then they went to Kansas City and competed. They did. They did. Following week, third down and seven. That's caught up to the 35-yard line. Conklin. It was also the night that Kevin Stefanski had COVID and had to watch the game on television from his basement in Cleveland. It's strange here when it came to things like that, right? Weird. Dropped. Two-minute warning. Right now. At one point it looks like Dak Prescott's going to be the guy. Brock Purdy's going to be the guy. Who gets hot at the end is always important. It's a big one with Baltimore, Miami, obviously. Home field advantage and so many different things. Right. There we go. Oh, let's end the night with a little bit more bang line metal. You'll love it. It's the perfect ending. Second and ten. And rolled down up at about the 43-yard line is the Bonaconda. third and two. Can you remember a ball other than the fade early to Garrett Wilson where they've been able to get the ball thrown downfield successfully? Nope. And whoever plays the Browns, that'll be the challenge with the press man with their three corners and the pass rush that they have. Because, I mean, you got under 2.5 to get the ball out, probably 2.2 with a good offensive line, and can you get separation? Can you get downfield to be able to get away from these corners as tough as they are in tight man coverage. Do we make history on Thursday nights or what? 50 or more combined points in the first half. No touchdowns in the second half. And we're down to 60 seconds. So the crowd right now, I mean, this is just like the perfect moment for them. you know you got it in hand one playoff appearance in two decades now comes a second little tip here it's the greatest feeling in the world whatever it is if your team is going to do something special and you got a minute or a couple of minutes to really let it go and there they go turf there's a guy in again I tell you I've lived in Ohio most of my life this is about as good of a fan base that I've ever encountered the loyalty and the passion of the Cleveland Browns you got an injured Browns player down they stopped it otherwise the Jets were going to be content to just let it go That's Cleveland's first charge timeout. Usually set the game clock for 12 seconds. So one more play. Trying to identify the injured Brown here. I think it's Z'Darrius Smith. Well, he got hurt last week, if it is. But he was able to come back, and it is. Yeah, but he's getting up right now. Again, he's an edge player, but they move him inside again to be able to get Alex Wright into the game, give him those three pass rushers, and he just went down. He's walking off under his own power now. Good to see he's got ten days to rest up before the next one. A little bit of a smile here, too, so you know he's going to be all right. There's Garrett, and they can exult. A little celebrating tonight, as will many folks in northeastern Ohio.
