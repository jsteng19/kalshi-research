 Rams house, but as far as the Raiders are concerned, well, this is kind of like their Airbnb. Yeah. I mean, it'll be their house, but I mean. And you live in the area. You live in the area. We talked about it on the way over here. I said, what do you think? 50-50, 60-40. What was the speculation coming into tonight? I think the Rams thought they might have to use silent count tonight as a home game. Yeah, there's Mark Davis and Ice Cube. He's been a Raiders fan forever. Oh, yeah. Well, the Raiders played here between 82 and 94. Won one Super Bowl during that span. 13 years at the Coliseum. Meanwhile, after the timeout, third down and five. Run a draw here. I mean, the Rams are equal to the task. Nothing doing. Jacobs stopped at the line of scrimmage. Bobby Wagner is there in his fourth down. And Carlson, his group, comes in for a field goal attempt. Yeah, so third down and medium. You walk both the linebackers up. You show the threat of blitz. and that's all they're doing. Even if you throw, you've got both these backers led by Bobby Wagner, eyes on the ball, they see the handoff, and of course, because everybody's walked up, those linemen are occupied, and Bobby Wagner's instincts right away takes that play out. 52-yard attempt. And Carlson, who is money, makes it. 2.22 left in the opening quarter. And Las Vegas jumps on top. 10-0. Hockey bill for about $5 billion has been open. Raiders on top. 10-0. And the kick is returnable from the 11-yard line by Brandon Powell. Nice run back here before he gets run out of bounds in front of the Raider bench. Well, well, well. Baker Mayfield. A little bit more than 48 hours ago. He's in Carolina. Gets a flight out of Charlotte. Lands here around 9 o'clock. Goes to the facility. Put him by the hotel that night. Goes to practice yesterday. And here he is. How is he calling the play when he's been here for a day and a half? And he's not just saying a couple words there. His time with Kevin Stefanski at Cleveland helps as far as rolling over to Sean McVay in this offense. So Wolford on the three and out on their first series. And Mayfield's first play as a ram will be a pass-off play action. Go figure! To the 45-yard line. He hits Van Jefferson, who we probably didn't even meet until yesterday. Yeah, he's going to go shake his hand and say, hey, I'm Baker. Corner gets downfield with the off route, and then it just creates a nice opening right in front where the corner is able to get downfield. And, boy, he throws in rhythm. You think he's been doing this since August in camp? I mean, it's taking the snap. It's the operation, the execution, the rhythm. It's fascinating. Pretty good debut, 21-yard gain off play action to Jefferson. Again, play action, rolling left, keeping his eyes downfield, directing traffic. Takes off and slides to a stop. They'll spot it at around the 39-yard line. It's, you know, in Carolina, he started a few games earlier this season, lost the job, and they told him the other day, you're going to be the number three quarterback. And you're going to be basically inactive. So he wanted to get, in effect, released, put on waivers, and the Rams were the only team that actually put a claim in for him. Second and four. Final minute of the quarter. Handed off to Akers, and he'll get stopped there for a minimal game. Sean McVay as a play caller is a guy that doesn't necessarily look down at his play sheet very often. He knows the play sheet. He's memorized it. He knows it inside and out. And it's a feel. He calls the game off of a feel. Tonight, with Baker Mayfield in the game, you've got a wristband. Sean McVay is communicating. He's making sure they're on the same page. Having to look down to say play 44. and Baker goes into the huddle and reads the play because he's only been there for a day and a half. Blanked by the just-activated Malcolm Brown. Going deep downfield, and that's incomplete. Trying to hit Atwell, who's covered well that time by Nate Hobbs. And you've got a late flag that just came in. And the Raiders are moving back. And Hobbs, who was just activated the other day, has even been hurt. get the call here from Brad Rogers in a second but the Rams are already marching to set up a third down and short third and two halfway through the quarter I had a chance to call White's last game of his career in a national championship last year and he's more than capable he just doesn't have the experience he's a very similar style of back as Josh Jacobs, he's got some shake but also has plenty of power to work through these arm tackles so third down and two that's Abdullah the third down back number 22 flanking Carr Carr in the pocket down the left sideline and a little too long again you get that one match up there with Adams going against Ramsey incomplete so the Rams able to hold and get the ball back really good job here by Jalen Ramsey who has lost a couple of those battles tonight to Adams. This time he takes away that alley to the outside, just kind of squeezes him towards the boundary, and look how tough of a throw that would be, even if you were able to get it in there for Derek Carr. So we've seen a couple go the way of Adams. This time, give Jalen Ramsey credit for a good play. The whole second punt of the night. To the 26, a flag is thrown immediately. and run back to the 34 pending the infraction. There's Josh Jacobs back already. It was a 48-yard punch, 6-yard return, and awaiting the call here from Rodgers, who tells us. Kick, holding, return team, number 31. Ten-yard penalty from the end of the kick. Rubyfield stays in the game. The ball is at the 17-yard line as they begin this drive. On the ground, Akers picking up about five, up to the 22. How about Baker up there? He's changing the call. Every run they have, they can, meaning they'll flip it. They'll go from the left to the right or right to the left, based on the alignment of the defense. Brian Allen, of course, is helping him on short notice, but a good job of recognizing what he needed to see to give them some positive yards. Again, for this offense, with this offensive line and receivers, they've got to stay on schedule against this Raiders defense. They get behind the sticks, it's over. Rolling, chased, throws, caught. Skoranek, second time he's made a catch tonight. So McVay has a lot of familiarity with Mayfield because back in 2018, they were going to the Combine. He wound up on the same flight with Mayfield, who would eventually be the number one draft choice that year. And they sat together and talked nothing but football for the three and a half hours between L.A. and Indy. Genuinely likes him. And it seems like Baker Mayfield in his career, he's become a polarizing figure from Cleveland to Carolina. I know whether you're a fan of those teams or not. People have strong feelings towards him. Sean McVay is a fan, and it goes back to that meeting, like you said, on that flight. Stepping up, going deep. There's a bumping and shoving, and a flag is thrown. Tutu Adwell was down there getting bumped by Merrig, and the flag is thrown. They're going to plead the case here that it was uncasual, but no search is the official. Number 25. I'll tell you what. that's a pretty savvy move by an inexperienced receiver in his second year I think he looked Merrick up and knew that he couldn't get to the ball and intentionally ran into him to draw that foul and right away came up knew exactly what he was doing no chance to get to the ball looks over sees a safety that doesn't see him looking at the football and runs into him and draws the flag cool move if indeed he did do that 41-yard penalty. And the ball's at the 30-yard line. Running back is the rookie, Tyron Williams. Fake toss to him. A little razzle-dazzle here. Adwell coming around the side, but only three yards or so. You know, the thing here is he just makes a great play. We're bragging on him, but here he shows his inexperience. When you come around the corner like this, off this double reverse, you've got to be a little bit more instinctive and patient as a runner. You've got a couple guys out there, and he just runs right. He doesn't give his back a chance, Kyron Williams, a chance to make a block. You almost have to set the block up and then get down the sideline for some positive yards. A third down and four. Yeah, have him stacked, so it gives him some room to make this cut. This cut, you can see the pressure there by Crosby almost affected that throw. I mean, literally, look at that. As he makes the throw on the follow, he can't even follow through because of how quickly Crosby got in there but had enough on it to be able to get the ball out there to trammel for the first. Play action. Look out. Under pressure. Down he goes to the 20-yard line. Bilal Nichols gets to him for the sack. Well, I don't know how he held on to this football because Nichols, right away, he went for the ball. He just overpowers the left guard. Skura just uses his power, pushes him straight back. Then he goes for the ball. It looked like it got away from Baker Mayfield, but fortunately for the Rams and Baker, he's able to get the ball back. Could have been a face mask on that, too. Yeah. Could have been, should have been. First sack of the game. They bring the rookie Tyron Williams into the backfield. Second and 19. Under pressure again. Mayfield is able to escape. And throws incomplete. But at least he saved what would have been about a 7 or 8 yard sack. Third down and 19. This is the fear of anybody that goes against the Raiders. You get an obvious passing situation. and Jones and Crosby have a chance to just tee off and get into the backfield. They don't chip. He doesn't have any help. Hevenstein's out there all alone. Somehow Baker Mayfield's able to get away from it, but both guys off the edge collide and get to Baker Mayfield. They can pressure without having to bring those backers because of both of the edge pressure men that they have. Third and 19. That's three receivers off to the right side. Shoots it underneath, and that's incomplete. Well, not a good start here, but a flag. This is a third down and 19. They had men eight yards downfield there. Ineligible man downfield. Offense number 79. That penalty has declined. We've got to the play. fourth down. Not a good series there for Havenstein. He's the only guy who's been in the lineup all season long for the Rams on that offensive front. And a poor series. One of the first where they just look discombobulated really from the very beginning of that drive just going backwards. Bradley Dixon, the punt. Hewlin Cole is the returner. Cole drifting. And gets hit as he makes the catch and the flag is thrown. So, that was Jacob Harris coming in there and decking him and drawing the flag. Put him in a 46-yard punt. Was he blocked into him is the question. Well, definitely was. Teamer just pushed him right in the back into him. Roderick Teamer. So you've got a huddle here. Six officials. That's a long discussion. It is. you would think somebody had a really good view of it. Let's bring our fish on. Yeah, Terry, what do you think? Well, we don't have Terry's mic on just yet. Now I'm here. There you go. It appears to me that he does push him into the receiver. Now, if his momentum's taken there already, they'll leave the flag down, but I think he actually pushes him in and prevents the defender from avoiding him. there's also a foul for defensive holding. There you go. You've got two flags. So that's the reason for the lengthy coffee break. And they're coming over to discuss this with Josh McDaniels. Mayfield looking at the tablet Who they are, and I thought they took huge strides last week In the close game and coming up a little short against Seattle Carlson kicking off You got Powell coming over to the sideline to field it at the 9-yard line Down the sideline he goes and out of bounds with the flag thrown At the 27-yard line Powell return man why not but he was a big part of the running game last week sure was been sick all week again it's a short week so it's good to see him out there being 2-2 out well really have to pick it up legal formation kicking team number 34 5 yard penalty first down LA Rams there's the The offense won. It's the first time all season they've had the same five up front. 14 different combinations. Unreal. It's just one of those years. You know, you think you've seen it all, and then you see it with Sean McVay and this offense's face. So Wolford gets the start. Fighting through a neck issue. Cam Akers is the running back. He had a couple of touchdowns last week. Good run here to get things started. Ten-yard pickup. Carroll makes the tackle. Cleveland Pearl. And a good beginning for Acres, who's had an up-and-down season. The guy who actually at one point during the middle of the year wanted to be traded. They couldn't find a trade partner. And then they talked to him, and he settled down and brought him back. Yeah, it was around week five. He was public with it. In fact, the Rams countered with, you know, we've got to move him. And basically sat him for a couple weeks. He talked it out, worked it out. Moved Darrell Henderson out, and now he's the guy. He's the guy that's got to make the plays. Spot him a half yard shy, so second down and one, and he won't get to one here to set up third down. Akers again that time. Jerry Tillery, former Charger, makes the stop, and it's third down. Tillery has been a great addition over the last few weeks, coming over after he got released by the Chargers. Look at that extension. Able to get off of that block, throw Shelton into the backfield, and come up with a loss. Been a great addition to go along with the edge of Chandler Jones and Max Crosby off those edges. Rookie Tyron Williams, fifth-round pick out of Notre Dame, is now the running back. And on the end round, nothing happening here. 2-2 Atwell on a play that worked very well last week with Atwell. Well, not this time. Max Crosby, having a Pro Bowl type of season, sniffs it out. So they come up a half yard shy on first down and then have to punt. This is called doing your homework right here. Max Crosby watched a film that we all watched and saw the jet sweep all game against Seattle and how effective it was. Right away sees Atwell on third and short. He's in charge of taking him out in case they hand the football off. So great job. Crosby, known as a pass rusher, has really, really improved against a run. In addition to sacks, that's 18 tackles for loss for him this year. Meanwhile, Dixon's punt will bound into the end zone. And so, after a very quick three and out at the 20-yard line, the rake basically coming out. Here's a guy who's been there nine years, but he's played in only one playoff game. They made the playoffs twice with him, but he was hurt the first time. And then last year, he finally got to postseason, and they were one and done. I think the important thing is what happened since then. They've won three in a row. I think it got the attention of a lot of the players, especially the younger players. Remember, you have a first-year head coach. People are trying to understand the direction of where things are going, and when your leader shows you that kind of passion, you respond to it. Off play action. Carr has time. Flag is thrown, as you see. Jacobs makes the catch and takes it for the moment up to the 25-yard line. Got Bobby Wagner there for a hold. Wagner coming off a great game against his ex-teammates. Ten years in Seattle. Had a pick and two sacks last week. Holding. Defense number 45. Five yards penalty. Automatic first down. So Seattle let Wagner go. He was surprised and disappointed. Yeah. For sure. The epitome of a pro's pro. He started four years in college at Utah State, 11 years now in the NFL, 15 straight years of starting. And as a middle linebacker for a defense, nobody sees the game better. It's a good question, and we'll let you know as soon as the game gets underway. It's a late arriving crowd. We're in Southern California, so everybody's going to be in. But it comes fashionably late. A lot of traffic outside. But the place will get filled up tonight and be very noisy as Matt Gay will kick off for the Rams. Amir Abdullah and D.J. Turner, there is Turner, are both back at the goal line. So week 14 begins in L.A. with a touchback. So Carr comes out. he's really gotten a lot more comfortable as the season has progressed especially obviously the last three weeks he's been hot there his numbers for the season pass rating a little above the league average and he starts with as he will a lot tonight with two backs in the backfield with Jacobs and they use a fullback a lot Jakob Johnson plays that role and there he is number 45 offset. And from the 25, away we go with a run through the middle, and Jacobs picks up four yards. He takes it up to the 29-yard line. Tackled there by Michael Hoyt. It'll be second down and six. I know you worked many years with Coach John Madden, and this would be a game as his former team he'd be very proud of with his 21 personnel with the two backs. It's just not a look you see as much and modern game in the NFL. And it puts a lot of pressure on the defense as it goes up against this offense because you've got to deal with Jacobs and that fullback, and, of course, you've got the threat of Adams downfield. Second down and six. Again, it's Jacobs, and this time he'll get stuck as he crosses the 30-yard line. McDaniels used the fullback along with Belichick in New England with great frequency. with Aaron Donald out you're going to have to see others step up and make plays in the interior this time Greg Gaines 91 you can see he's able to handle that instead of a double team he gets a one on one block and you know he is holding the point in the middle of that defense kind of the anchor especially as I said without Donald in there Amir Abdullah is the third down back he sends Adams the star in motion, sets up on the right side. And on third and five, going deep downfield, and the coverage is good. There's a one-handed flag comes in, and there's Adams. And all night long, it's going to be Adams and Jalen Ramsey in that one-on-one battle. And the flag is against the Rams. The result of the play is a completed defense. Pass interference, defense number five. That penalty is declined. First down. 32-yard gain. One-handed Look at the motion to create the matchup. They bring him over to set up Adams against Jalen Ramsey. No safety help behind. He's able to get a step on him. That's the way to start the game for Devontae Adams. One-on-one against Jalen Ramsey. Why not? Just one-handed catch. That's all he needed. A little space from the 38-yard line. Back to the ground they go. A little hesitation there. And about a two-yard pickup for Jacobs. Ramsey, of course, has been one of the best corners in the league for years, but this year he's been torched for seven touchdowns. In no other season did he give up more than three. Meanwhile, you've got Alex Barr as the right guard, who is the Raider who is down and needs some attention. Yeah, just an unprecedented year for Jalen with a lot of the injuries around him. Alex Barr's down. He's a free agent that came over from Chicago, played his college days at Notre Dame. John Simpson will come in and take his place. The offensive line was coming together, and now McDaniels will come out fake to Jacobs, pass to the outside and through the hands of Max Hollins. He couldn't handle that. It'll be third down and nine. Sakaar in his ninth season now. He got very emotional after that loss to Indianapolis. They were upset. He was 2-7. He let pretty much nine years of frustration come out in that press conference, But in a way, it helped to raise the spirits of the team, at least get them to really maybe concentrate more, go to work. And they picked up a couple of overtime wins and then last week beat the Chargers. Third down and nine. Quick flip to the outside. And that's going to be a first down and more for Amir Abdullah. Bobby Wagner, the longtime Seahawk, makes the tackle. First down. You see Kobe Durant right here. He recognizes it and rolls the dice a little bit, trying to beat those blocks getting to him. Gets in there, but once he's being aggressive like that, he takes himself out of position, and now you've got some room to run behind those blockers and good quick call to protect the quarterback there to get the ball out, and they get the first. Meanwhile, the new running back here is Zamir White. So we've already seen all three running backs tonight, And he goes next to nowhere, tackled at the 23, and he flagged down. Referee tonight is Brad Rogers. After further consultation. Illigiusa hands it up to the face. Defense number 93. Five-yard penalty. First down. He's Copeland. He's on the offense's left side over the left guard. You can see him get up into the face of the rookie, Parham. He's with the hands around the neck. Now they go full back again here. Johnson playing that role, leading the way to the outside. Not able to turn the corner that time. And Copeland making the tackle. So, Jacobs, you know, it's funny because he's been listed on the injury report the last couple of weeks with a calf and a quad. God forbid he should be healthy, right? What he's done over the past three weeks is tremendous. He's been able to battle through quite a bit of adversity throughout his life. And I think he really appreciates the game. And this year when they declined his fifth year of his rookie contract, there was just a new edge about him this year. So he's fighting through everything to have a monster year and to be in a good spot next year with a new contract. Leads in rushing, leads in scrimmage yards by a mile. Carr rolling, keeps his eyes downfield. He'll take it out of bounds. Leonard Floyd chased him out at that spot, making it third down and four on the game's opening drive for Las Vegas. Good job there by Carr. Plenty of athletic ability just to be able to give you some positive yards. You're going to play man coverage against him. And Raheem Morris will, of course, once they get into the red zone area, he'll get a little bit tighter with the coverage. And good recognition there by Derek Carr. I think he saw that pre-snap and knew that he could pick up some positive yards. Got Adams at the bottom against Ramsey. Yep, there they go. Little flip here. Jacobs, tons of room inside the five. And out of bounds at the two-yard line. And Durant takes him out there. And it sets up a first and goal for the Raiders. So, you know, you see the man-to-man down here. So you just run him off. And now you've got to beat the 300-pound outside linebacker, Michael Hoyt. Just a quick flip. Get to the outside. See the man-to-man coverage. There's nobody there to take care of the edge. Great call there by Josh McDaniels to get to the edge. Because of the injuries to some of these outside linebackers, they release Justin Hollins. Hoyt has moved from defensive tackle to outside linebacker. Playing well, but no chance there. Here's the 11th play of the drive. And fighting his way just shy of the goal line goes Jacobs. So it's an interesting drive in the sense 11 plays, 8 of them on the ground. Just 3 passes. And Al, excuse me, but I think part of that is Raheem Morris trying to figure out how Josh McDaniels, because he can do it both through the air with Adams or the physicality and that two-back look. I think they wanted to start by trying to stop the run, and this opening drive, Josh McDaniels, if they punch it in, has got to be really excited about. Yeah, the big play, of course, was a 32-yard pass to Adams. Meanwhile, into the end zone. For the touchdown goes Josh Jacobs. to the man who's number one in rushing, carries the ball seven times on this drive, and a little bit more than five and a half into the game, the Raiders have the lead. Yeah, they bring the rookie out of Ohio State there, Munford in as an extra tackle, kind of as a tight end roll, and they go heavy, that jumbo look, and get behind Illuminor and Munford and just wear down that Rams front on that drive. Daniel Carlson for the extra point. And it is 7-0. So that long drive, 75 yards, big play right here. What a catch. One-handed, 32 yards, setting up Jacob. 42 sacks on the year. And while all the attention goes on Stafford and Kupp, and it should, The offensive line, I think, is where Sean McVay, they've really tried to redefine. Been handed to 91. He pushes the rookie parham right back into the face of Derek Carr. He gets nothing on the ball. You can see, I thought, too, Troy Hill might make the interception, but a great effort there by Jones, losing his balance, coming down with the football. So can Mayfield do something here in limited time? The pass intended for Tyler Hickey is incomplete. Baker has three completions tonight, 21, 22, and 22 yards. I'm just impressed that he knows where to go with the ball, let alone the timing and accuracy with these receivers. Even that last ball, I mean, there's a chance to complete that. I was telling you to break. It's almost like he's making a mockery out of training camp and rhythm and timing and all the work you put in with these receivers. Who needs OTAs? He shows up and he's just spinning. Just get on a plane, fly cross country, say hello to your teammates, That how long my name is And start slinging it That incomplete here Crowd wants or at least the Rams part of the crowd wants to play Going to get it 10 for Austin Trammell It be third down and 10 Interesting strategy. You know, it's not shocking. Sean McVay is an aggressive guy. He's got confidence. And especially, he's kind of feeling his quarterback out right now. Believes that he can make plays. First couple passes, incomplete. You know, with 41 seconds here. Well, the Rams have one time out. The Raiders have none if they get the ball back. Third and ten. Through the middle. Up to the 25-yard line. That's Malcolm Brown, the once and present Ram. So it's fourth down. And knowing that the Raiders did not have a timeout, the Rams on the third and ten say, Hey, you know what? That's it. We'll just settle down. We'll take the ball to start the second half, and away we go. And now it's a game of adjustments. You know, if you're Sean McVay, now you've got a little bit of a better handle. Remember, they started the game with John Wolford. Now you've got Baker Mayfield in. You know where you're going. Start the second half with a football. See if you can get points on the board. Who would have guessed this storyline? Mayfield, three out of six, 65 yards. Keeps him in the game. It's 13-3. At the half, Mercedes-Benz. halftime show coming right up. But the Rams will get the ball here to start the second half. I remember that they had a drive right before the fumble. They were moving the ball down the field. Baker Mayfield making some good throws. Had a chance to get points. And then of course they fumbled the ball after the big play by Jones. Chandler Jones. And the big interception by the Rams to stave off would have been a larger lead. Meanwhile here's Powell going nowhere, 17-yard line. He stopped moments ago. Kaylee with Rams coach Sean McVay. Sean, how do you evaluate Baker's command of your offense after, what, 48 hours with the playbook? It's been impressive, Kaylee. I thought he did a really good job. Would have loved for us to come away with points. You know, he ends up getting us points on his first drive. We're in scoring position. We turn it over on first down. See if we can get something going at the start of the second half. A strong way to finish the first half of your defense. How do you evaluate their performance? Yeah, it was a great job by Ernest Jones. Got to be able to get off the grass, but that's a big-time deal there. Got to get some points out of this first drive here offensively. And here is that first drive. Off play action, and the pass is underthrown. Had the open man, that was Van Jefferson, who he hit the first time he threw tonight, second down and ten. And that's more of what you'd expect to see with a quarterback who's only been in town for a few days and learning a new offense. It's not just the fact that he's memorized some of these plays and he has familiarity with where to go with the ball. It's the actual rhythm and timing with the receivers that I think if you watch the first half, you have to just be impressed by just that. That was the first throw that we've seen where the depth and the throw weren't on the same page. Second and ten. Pressure. Buy in time. And out he goes and slides into the Rams. bench, along with the chain gang group. Baker's first half right here. Yeah, and I think all of us were, even Greg's talking about, boy, look at this. I mean, it's Hubs' first play. Came right in, made a great throw to Van Jefferson. Here's great separation, an unbelievable route there by Tutu Atwell. Nice positive yards. Then a third and long, sits in the pocket, makes the throw to Skoranek. So three different receivers and three really good throws. Third and four. Malcolm Brown is the back. Five-man rush, and that pass is going to the ground and caught. That time it is Austin Trammell at a Rice first-year man, and they're able to convert close to the red zone. No foul on the play is fourth round. Now what? So there's no foul there for all. I thought both teams had gone inside the 25. McVay says, what's that all about? I thought, and again, you had both the receiver and Hobbs both kind of pushing a little bit back and forth. He's in phase. Sometimes when you don't get your head turned until late, they'll call a penalty. Maybe that's what initially brought the flag, but he looked like he was in phase running with him, stride for stride. Well, he's an interesting choice right now because you're at the 37. and he go for it with the guy who just got here 20 minutes ago and said Matt Gay will come in and attempt a long field goal that was spotted at the 45. So a 55-yard attempt for Matt Gay. And Gay's kick is good. Here in Hollywood, what else is new? Mayfield comes in, leads him to at least three. Back in 30. Rams sent him the playbook, which he read on that cross-country flight. Got to know enough of it to look fine on that drive for a while. Talking to Liam Cohen, their offensive coordinator today, about this whole subject. He just said, first of all, it's unprecedented. I think Cam Newton came over, came back to Carolina, had some time to get ready to be able to plan on short notice. This is a Thursday night game. Guy flew in Tuesday night into L.A. They didn't even practice yesterday. I asked him on the field before the game. How many throws did you get? He said about 20 yesterday with these guys. Meanwhile, a very short kick. Picked up at the 16-yard line. And tackled from behind up at the 32 is Amir Abdullah. And that's the end of the first quarter with the score. The Raiders 10. And the Rams 3. back from Inglewood after these messages. All right, time. First down for the Raiders. Keep it on the ground up to the 35-yard line. Jacobs. 13 years at the Coliseum. Came down from Oakland, went back there in 95. Fifth best record in the league. You had Plunkett, you had Flores coaching, you had Bowe, you had Marcus Allen, you had Howie Long. Seven playoff appearances, won Super Bowl 18 in Tampa. And Marcus Allen, I still think about that run, One of the great runs in the history of the Super Bowl. There's a man who's got a few Super Bowl rings. 18 years in two stints with New England. Josh McDaniels in his first year as a coach here. Meanwhile, Hollins, another play for him. So he's been involved already in three plays right now. Hollins with one rush and a couple of grabs in the first down. Job again by Carr, being able to work through these progressions. His offensive line, for the most part, doing a nice job of taking care of him. Looks left. Plenty of time. Simpson, who is in for bars, holding up and just trying to find those soft spots in his own. It's very different against this Rams defense without 99 in the middle. Yeah. One thing the Rams are pretty good at, though, is stopping the run. Fourth in the league coming into the game. They run a little draw here. and this time they don't stop the run very well because after the 50-yard line goes Jacobs, but a flag at the 46. Use of hands to the face. Defense number 93. Second time. First down. Copeland twice. It's the second time that Copeland, the second-year man out of Cincinnati, gets his hands up on the left guard, Dylan Parham. You see again, just right up on the neck. It's the exact same technique that he used the first time that he got called for. And keeps it there, too. He's not changing. It's just to make sure everybody sees it. Pretty easy to call. What a balanced attack. You know, this offense, this two-back look, really, if you're going to give them numbers, they're going to run the football. Now, this is the innovation still that Josh McDaniels can do. He's not just going to sit in that 21 personnel look. Now he goes to more of what you see every week with the three receivers. Click lock at one to the outside and then cutting it back. Jacobs again. You know, you think about this, Kirk. If the Raiders win tonight, and they're favored, they'd be 6-7. Yeah. Last year, after 13 games, they were 6-7 and made the playoffs. Absolutely. And I think that even though you have a new head coach or enough players that experienced that last year, that there's some energy. There's a real belief and confidence that this team, if they can get a win tonight, look at the rest of their schedule, they're confident they can do it again. Moves Keenan Cole into the slot. Second and five. A little flip here. Here goes Hollins again with a lot of room to roam. To the 24-yard line goes Mac Hollins. And, again, I think Josh McDaniel studied all week on film and said if they're going to move 97 from D-tackle off to the edge, Hoyt, we're going to work anytime we want. Different ways we're going to make him lose that edge, make him kind of squeeze, and it's the second time we've seen Hollins be able to get outside of him. And like I said, even the guys that are out in front, they don't even have to worry about blocking Hoyt. He's taking himself out of the play. Gain of 17. 11 first downs to 1. All the numbers one-sided to this point. Carr. Rolling, throwing along the sideline and hauled in there. That is Keelan Cole, six-year man, been around for a while out of Kentucky. Wesleyan makes his first catch of the night. In defense of Raheem Morris, you know, Terrell Lewis at that position has been injured most of his career and is not available tonight. They waived Justin Hollins. It's been everything that could go wrong on the outside opposite of Leonard Floyd has. So they just kind of, just for a chance of trying to mix in another player, they moved Hoyt in there and he played well. Came out, by the way, two sacks last week. But as a 300-pound outside linebacker, DeAnd, he's not equipped to be able to take care of that edge against that speed. Around the right side, D.J. Turner sees his first action of the night. Tripped up there by Troy Hill. Gain of six, second down and four. McDaniels gives Sean McVay some of his own medicine. You know, this is a big part of what the Rams did last week. run up the middle, get those linebackers' eyes on the interior, and then use speed out on the edge with that jet sweep. Continue to work the edges, and all that's going to do is help them to get back to their bread and butter to be able to run that football between the tackles when you can attack the edges. Second and four. That man again, but this time all kinds of flags come in. We saw two of them fly in. That was Jacobs on what would have been his 14th carry of the night, pending the call here. Offense, number 76, 10-yard penalty, second down. Well, that's Simpson who took the spot of the injured Alex Bars. There was penetration by Greg Gaines, and he just ends up having to hold on to him. Gaines able to shoot right behind the center, and you see Simpson a little bit late off the snap. But here's Keir Thomas now. He's a rookie out of Florida State. 275-pounder, but not as big as Hoyt. And I'm sure the biggest message that Raheem Morris told him, take care of the edge. We cannot let them continue to get outside of us. Rams, of course, decline that penalty. Take the down here. That was a five-yard loss. So that makes it third down and nine at the 13-yard line. See how they defend Adams here. He has the one catch, the one-handed catch. She's up top, one-on-one there, again, against Jalen Ramsey. He looks the other way. Low throw, bobbled. And they're going to rule that incomplete. D.J. Turner was there. So the Rams were able to hold, and it's fourth down. And that never had the football in his hands. Like you said, they're looking at that safety. Taylor Rapp was over there helping, so they go back the other way. No laces. You see that so often when these quick throws. Again, Turner never had possession of that football. But third possession? Yeah. Third chance to get points for the Raiders. And a chip shot field goal of 31 yards for Daniel Carlson. Cole puts it down. Carlson bangs it through. and with 9.40 to go in the opening half at SoFi, it's 13. He gets the award and he wins the Super Bowl that day. It doesn't get any better than that. What a way to head off into the sunset for Big Witt. Raiders on top by 10. So just showed some impatience there as a runner. A second down and 10. four and a half to go in the third and Mayfield rolling he's got nobody open downfield and just gets forced out of bounds along the sideline making it third down and long they started this second half with field position all three drives inside their own 20 they started at the 13 they started at their own 18 and on this drive at their own 17 after that penalty So that pass interference call flips the field and at least gives the Rams hope now in positive territory. There's Matthew Stafford along the sideline. Big third and ten now from the 30-yard line. Better have a plan for Crosby on your right. That one makes the grab. That's the first down. Flag is thrown all the way to the 16-yard line. Merrick takes him down there. And could be against the Rams. And is. That's on Havenstein. You put a big man out there in space against a defensive back. And here's Hobbs coming up in support. He quickly moves. And that quick movement forces the big tackle to just kind of grab on just long enough to get the attention of the official. He was by him, by the way. That was after he'd already made the move. He was gone. And hardly a classic hold, too. So it's third and 16 instead of first down. Line of scrimmage to 36. Three-man rush. Pass is caught to the 28-yard line. Goes Bryson Hopkins, the tight end. Denzel Perryman, middle backer, makes the stop. So fourth and seven. And in comes Gay to try to make it a one-score game. And then a flag comes in at the end of the play. Yeah, they were kind of drawing back and forth. There was a swing there by Coleman Shelton. You need a field goal here to get it within a possession. This is a dead ball penalty against the Rams. Pushed him back. It's going to take him out of field goal range. Oh, man. You have a holding call out in open field, and then potentially a dead ball foul. Personal foul. Offense number 55. 16 yards penalty. 50. It would have been a 45-yard field goal attempt, and now they're out of range. Here it is again. Yeah, and you've got Harmon right there. He kind of pushes. and then now we've got a potential issue. And, you know, anytime you get your hands up into the face of another player on the other side and you move your, you know, you're kind of swinging at them, that's what catches the attention of the official. So they had a gimme field goal, and now he's going to have to try it from 61 yards. Yeah, it would have been 45 or 46. This is from the other side of the 50-yard line. 61-yard attempt from Matt Gay. No good. And the Raiders will get the ball in midfield after that. Wide left by four yards. With 2.42 remaining in the third. I think we get... Self-immolation there. Yeah, yeah. And this is what Sean McVay has been working so hard on is going through this storm. This entire year has been a storm. A lot of adversity. You're sitting there looking at a 3-9 off of a Super Bowl season, all the injuries, and then you make a mental mistake right there. And Coleman Shelton knows that he cost himself and his team three points and a chance to get it within a possession. Now look at the field position that the Raiders get off of that missed field goal. Well, Jacobs is back in the game, so the X-rays turned out to be, we assume, negative. Little toss to him. He's looking to throw it back. And it's a minimal gain here. Bobby Wagner making the tackle 45. I think it's worth mentioning that Raheem Morris in this defense, if you go back to the beginning of this game, it was a touchdown, a field goal, and a field goal, and the Raiders were off and going with one of the better offenses in the NFL. And that was 13 points early in his game. Since then, with a lot of injuries, man, they've made some adjustments. Paul is number again, number 28. No game there. So that's 18 carries in the half. I'd say, you've got to be happy with Greg Gaines. You know, fourth-year guy, Aaron Donald's out. You would think it would be a big advantage in the inside. But watch him with this little slant angle move. It goes across the center, and now he's able to shoot that gap and get the leverage off the edge of the center Andre James. So it's one way to slow down Jacobs and his physicality at low center gravity is to shoot a 300-pounder and move him from one side to the other side of the center. Raiders took the timeout here. Got 117 on the clock. Look at the infinity board. Arming the playing field. Abdullah is in the backfield on third and three. Carr. Down the sideline for Adams as he makes the grab inbounds. Where is he? They look at each other. The officials do. Caught it. Holy smokes. He's just, he's at such a different level. The route one-on-one against Jalen Ramsey. And what he's really known for is not just the release. He gets out in front. Watch the late hands. Doesn't tip his hands at all for Ramsey to be able to defend that pass. It's virtually impossible for any corner to stop Adams once he gets a step on you because the discipline to put those hands up and then the ability to bring it in and get the two feet down. He's proven that twice tonight. Look at this. Look at this. Most receivers, their hands are already up. At the very last tenth of a second, those hands go up, and Ramsey doesn't have a chance to react to try to strip him away from the football. Beautiful. That was a third and three play for 35 yards. He's caught two tonight, has Adams. One for 35 and the other for 32. And that's the difference in the last three weeks. They've been getting the ball downfield with the running game, the threat of Jacobs, and then you throw in what Adams can do downfield. Last four games in their career, no touchdowns, no picks. So Ramsey, 51 times, 12 targets, has been holding him in check, but not tonight. From the 15-yard line, Carr. And he'll be run out of bounds near the line of scrimmage. forced out that time by Greg Gaines. Good coverage by the secondary in the end zone. Second down and 10. Great pressure there without having to blitz. Leonard Floyd has really had to try to pick it up with all the injuries they have. Really to me the only real pressure that they get without blitzing is from 54. And that time he flushed Derek Carr completely on his own to get out of the pocket. moving Adams all over the place just called out Wagner's number number did Carr dancing around throws caught 10 yard line that's Adams making the catch underneath Bobby Wagner makes the tackle and we're under a minute to play now in the half it's a big series for the Rams they are remember they start the second half after deferring, they get the football. You know, they can hold the Raiders to a field goal here. Team that has lost six in a row. They're on the ropes. You know, you're down 16-3. Feels a lot better than 20-3 with a quarterback that's been in town for 48 hours. You saw a shot of the despondent Cam Akers. That was a great drive they had going, and all of a sudden, fumble. moving again Adams now back to the left of Carr Adams in the slot this time Abdullah in the backfield third and five Carr under pressure softball is picked off in the end zone Ernest Jones Threw a little lollipop that time. Under pressure. High in the air and Jones comes down with a huge pick. The Rams pulled him off. Get the ball. 49 seconds left. Your man Gaines. Yeah, Gaines has had a big night. He's just pushing the pocket here again. Without Aaron Donald, the batons play. Well, they had the busted play. Now they're set back. Back in 30 seconds. Compressing it. Either having a tough time. Remember, it's a new helmet. Hasn't worn this helmet until, what, yesterday? And, of course, the crowd now. Very vociferous. Tons of Raider fans. Lots of noise. After the timeout, third down and 13. Deep drop. Mayfield fires over the middle. and making the grab at the 24-yard line is Ben Steronic. Third and 13. Third and 13, and think about the edge pressure potentially you've got to deal with with Jones and Crosby. So you need some time. You need the chance to be able to step up. They give him just enough time, and how about the throw by Baker Mayfield? Good job by Havenstein holding Crosby out, literally. and it's a throw up in the air where Skoronic has a chance. From the 23. Loses the ball. Akers losing it. Big pile up. Raiders think they have it. Opposition always thinks they have it. Who's at the bottom of the pile? Now they're demonstrably saying they've got it. But it's up to one of the zebras to tell us. Raiders Chandler Jones was able to rip it out oh boy that's the end of that drive losing the ball most among active players the 34 for Chandler Jones who had three sacks last week after having a half a sack all season long going to the Charger game. Back to the ground they go. Some tough yardage here. Dealing a seven for Josh Jacobs. Back to the fumble. Yeah, he actually, not only is he hit, it's perfect. I mean, this is exactly the way you rep it in practice. He punches it out. But watch him. Follow him to the ball because Akers has it, it looks like, right there. But 55 at the bottom of that pile as a lot of bodies came in there. Look who came out with the football. Part man, part bloodhound. That was a battle to get to that. Yeah. Sean trying to console Lakers in a manner of speaking. This will be a first down here for Josh Jacobs. So Jacobs tonight in the first half has already carried it 16 times for 51 yards. Talking to Josh McDaniels yesterday about this offense and the balance and the big playability with Adams, who, by the way, has been quiet. I wouldn't be surprised if they try to remind the defense of that vertical thread. But the body blows of this offense. His big thing was, now that we've got five that we feel good about on the offensive line, we want to control the line of scrimmage with Josh Jacobs. And it's just wear on a defensive front over the course of the entire game. You're rewarded in the third and fourth quarter. Especially a defensive front without Aaron Donald. underneath. Caught at the 30-yard line and to the 35 goes Josh Jacobs. First catch of the night for him. Derek Carr, I think, every week seems to get more and more comfortable in McDaniel's system. I think a lot of people just see him having a great career. Think about it. In nine years, he's had six different head coaches, six different play callers. So it's taken a little bit of time for him to get the rhythm and the understanding of what they're trying to accomplish. And it just feels like these last four or five weeks, they really have found who they want to be. He should compare notes with Baker Mayfield. Swinging on the outside, having a little bit of room, putting his shit out of the two-minute warning. And that takes us to the two-minute warning. So, now a special look at Avatar, The Way of Water. Only in theater. 13-3. First and 10 from their own 43. Little flip here to Max Hollins. And Hollins with a nice block from Jacobs. Turns what might have been a one-yard gain into a little bit more. Seven and back, second and three. It's always great to see the NFL's leading rusher show his teammates that he's unselfish. We continue to see Hollins get out on the edge. And 26 leading the way. He picked up a couple blocks here. Watch him get out in front. He's got Simpson, more on there. Look at 26. Hits Bobby Wagner. Tries to get another one. Second and three. And Stafford on the bench as well. Of course, he's not playing. There are two fouls on the play. One by each team. Catch interference. Kicking team number 84. holding on the return team number 20. The Raiders have elected to re-kick the ball. It will be fourth down. All right, after all that. Meanwhile, a re-kick now from the 20-yard line. Riley Dixon has had that one blocked. And then it bounds out of bounds up around the 40-yard line in front of the Rams. Bench early in the third cap. And it's the combination of Derek Carr and Devontae Adams. A couple big plays. This is early in the game. Adams' first catch. You see our next-gen stats, the one-in-four chance of being able to come down with that catch. And this was just textbook. This is vintage. Devontae Adams, you saw the one-hander. Here, you see the late hands. Both of those plays on Jalen Ramsey in that one-on-one matchup. You know what has struck me is through the years, I mean, those catches, which used to be so unique. And when Beckham made that catch on the Sunday night game. Yeah. And now everybody's making these catches. Yeah. Yeah. And there's just something even more graceful about Adams when he does it. Just so routinely. Two-yard gain and a flag comes in from behind. Holding. Offense. Number 45. Ten-yard penalty. First down. Beckham Johnson. They're reunited. That's great. They talked about it from time to time through the years. about, eventually maybe, and it did happen. Car throws and that incomplete That was the tight end forced up Morrow who could not haul it in It be second down and 20 I thought it was cool for us to have a chance to talk on the field Both of us had a chance to talk with Devontae Adams just about that move and how much he looked forward to coming back and working with his college teammate Well, there was a big hit there. Taylor Rapp with a big hit on Cole. Cole goes out of the game. Here it is right here. Watch this big collision. bang. Incidental, really. Yep. Oh, walk it off on the sideline. Second down and 20 from the 32 yard line. Early in the third Raiders trying to make it four wins in a row and get to six and seven. Draw. Jacobs with a ton of room. Big game. Ball is out. Ball is out. He got to the 47. And at the 50-yard line, as Jacobs loses it, they're going to call him down by contact, and he is shaken up on the play. Well, he has worked so hard to get over the issue of fumbling the ball. You know, he had one last week, and he's done a great job all year. Here he's extending, elbow down. He's definitely down, and then the ball comes out. They went with a dime look with six defensive backs. It's very risky, even in second long against this running game and against 28, Josh Jacobs. He got 15. Abdullah is the back now, third down and five. They chase Carr out of the pocket. Carr looking for the sticks. Angles his way, but appears to be short. He is by about a yard. Bobby Wagner forces him out of bounds a yard shy of the first down. It's fourth down. He's spying. got pressure from Floyd there's a spy by Wagner he knows exactly where he needs to keep him and prevent him from getting to get that first down good speed in the open field which has eyes on Derek Carr again, Carr is an athlete not known necessarily to take off but once he gets flushed it's Wagner's job to clean it up and he does well the Raiders send in the punt group would they fake it on the fourth and one? they will not Cole, one of the best in the league. First punt of the night for Vegas. Fair caught at the 14-yard line by Brandon Howell. Ramps have it. Down by 10. It's so far. Dead right. And Raiders certainly, after all these years, hope they finally have done it. Yeah, it's been a long stretch. I thought it was interesting talking to Josh his time in Denver in 0-9 and 10. I think the difference he feels this time is having Dave with him to try to build this roster back up. Nice hold here and a gain of close to nine for Tyron Williams. Go back to 1998 John Carroll football. McDaniels in the class right there. 99. Hosted Ziegler on his visit. Must have been a great visit. They've been boys ever since. Spent a lot of time in New England together. Roommates in college. Pretty cool for him to have Dave Ziegler now with him. A lot of time in Foxborough to go. Second down and one. And again to the outside. And a nice game here. For Kyron Williams. Again, Al, this is what they've got to do. This is going to open up the play-action pass, and this is going to be able to get Baker Mayfield in more advantageous positions to be able to go play-action. Work the edge. Go after Chandler Jones. It's a lot different going against Crosby and Jones when you're running the football in favorable positions as opposed to being at second and 20 and third and 12 when they can come after you. They're working on Jacobs on the sideline, bringing out his pinky finger, we understand, is the issue with his right hand. Guy's carried the ball 19 times already tonight. Meanwhile, Mayfield fires, and that's incomplete, intended for Van Jefferson. You were talking about McDaniels when he was at Denver. It started out great. He was 6-0. Oh, my God. You know, it's off the Belichick tree, and here we go. And then forget about it. Flamed out, got fired before the end of the next season. And then spent the following year as the Rams offensive coordinator when they were in St. Louis under Jeff Fisher. Yep. Ends up back in New England. And, you know, I think like anybody, you go through phases in life. You grow, you develop, you mature. and it just feels like he and this franchise are in a good spot to be able to grow. Even this year, they still have unfinished business of what they think they can accomplish after a 2-7 start. I would guess he was getting word about Jacob's condition in that last conversation. Sure looked like it. Rams take a timeout. Watch his right finger against the pinky, we're told. Here it is. All his weight came right down on that right hand. Kaylee, what do you know? Yeah, so Al, when they took Jacob's glove off, they taped his right pinky finger. Then they put his glove back on and actually buddy taped his ring finger to that pinky finger on the outside of the glove. He is not shy about showing that he's in pain, but he's trying to work through it. Yeah, great close-up shot of exactly what he's going to deal with when they get the ball back. Second and ten now. Swing it to the outside and knocked away. Mad Max. Max Crosby. Why does he have two X's in his first name? M-A-X-X-B. He was 11 pounds, 9 ounces at birth. That's pretty good. And he commits himself every week, every day to the cause of getting better. His get-off. So quick. And when he can't get to you, he's going to, with his length, it's 6'5". He's able to get up and knock that ball down. Such an athlete within this defense. A real building block in only his fourth year. You say pretty good, not for Mrs. Crosby. Right. Third down and ten. Mayfield going to keep it. And gets tackled with the 30-yard line. So the secondary does its work. He's working with new guys, of course, who he barely knows. And it's fourth and ten. Like any quarterback, it's always tough to work through progressions on third down. And especially when you're a quarterback that's been learning an offense for two days. He worked left. No one's there. Comes back to his right by then. The pressure had gotten to him. So he caught the fleeting glimpse of Jacobs going back into the locker room. Dixon's third punt of the night coming. Keelan Cole sets up at the 25-yard line. It's a line drive loop to the sideline. And there's a flag down, and they ran into Dixon, and this may give the Rams a first down. What would have been a fourth and ten, this Brandon Bolden. There is no foul on the play. There is no foul now. They throw a flag. And then say no flag. So do we. A rookie out of Georgia drafted in the fourth round. His carry here is a nice one. A gain of eight yards goes White with eight minutes to play in the third. Getting again to that edge. We've seen Michael Hoyt. Now we have Keir Thomas. A good job at a first play for Samir White to come in. Lead blocker with Johnson. and they're just trying to make sure that they're able to secure the edge and get positive yards on first and ten. Second and two, telling us that Jacobs is now questionable to return. And the Rams are able to stop him. And again, a short kick, five-yard line, Brandon Powell looking for room. Nice tackle made, and the ball comes out after he was down at the 22-yard line. So what's it like to make a play call if you're a Rams quarterback? Here we go. Lens to Deuce Ray Clausy, short, Landers, Z-Strong, X-Revo, Z-Lockback, can't with two-jet, X-Monday, Astro, Reed, alert, money, Deacon, Flo, F-Panama on the Omaha. Ready, break. So that's John Wolford, and he's in his car, and he plays that back so he can learn all of the play calls. and this is, well, Mayfield doesn't have to deal with all of that, but from the 22-yard line, Baker Mayfield's second drive starts with a run here. Cam Akers, you know, you were a quarterback. By the time he got the play call out, you had a lorangenis, wouldn't you? I think for fans at home to understand, it's 36 to 48 hours he's had to try to understand and digest his playbook. He said to you and I on the field before the game, good thing I got a good memory. And Liam Cohn, his offensive coordinator, told me today that this guy's crazy. The notes that he takes, the highlighters out, it's just unprecedented. The preparation that he's put in to put himself in a position. There's the sheet right there on his wrist. I mean, it's fascinating he's out there. You need Ted Williams' eyesight to read that, a magnifying glass. Cam Akers, close to a first down. And the execution of it, Liam says, is, again, Sean, who's used to moving fast with Matthew Stafford, now he's got to look at his play sheet, and he's got to 15 seconds on the play clock to be able to communicate and tell him things, give him the call, maybe potentially give him the read, everything that he can to help him. And then Baker will just look at his wristband and read the play number that he calls. But still, to do that in two days? I've never seen anything like that. And try to get some sleep. Yeah. and fighting his way for that first down. Look at that, keeping those legs churning. It's Cam Akers. The one good thing for Mayfield, though, too, I mean, he's going to wind up taking over down the stretch here. He's Wolford with the neck injury. Stafford's probably done for the season. Perkins is the other guy. But they get 11 days off now until their next game, the Monday nighter in Green Bay. Yeah, and, of course, he's still a Matthew Stafford here. I think if nothing else, you have an opportunity. You know, if you're Baker Mayfield, to show the rest of the league and the rest of this season what you're all about. Drops, back, finds his open man, 2-2 Atwell. And into Vegas territory he goes before he's pushed out of bounds at the 42-yard line. Yeah, it's man-to-man, and this is really just about him having an opportunity. This is the look that they showed us a lot last week. is play action, plenty of time, see the separation at the top of the screen there, and that's 2-2 Atwell. With the injuries to receiver, Atwell has an ability to get separation, even against their top cover man, Nate Hobbs. Starts two for three, does Baker Mayfield, for 43 yards. That was good for a gain of 22. And maybe a busted play here, so. just goes to the ground there, and that's Max Crosby. That was one of the easier sacks that Max Crosby has had. He's got now 11.5 on the year. You know, he's probably going to turn to his left, can hand it off or fake it to the left. Instead, he's expecting acres to the right, and obviously all he can do is eat it. Let's see what the official scorer does. He can rule out a tackle for loss either way. He leads the league in what they call TFLs. No sack. It's a tackle for loss. Well, then that helps him in tackles for all. He's got 18 tackles for loss. They call that a run. This is definitely a run. Going nowhere. Bakers get stopped there. Trayvon Merrick making the tackle. Third down and long. I mean, I'm all for it. I love 2-2 out well and what he's trying to do. And here's Brandon Powell. Look at him at his size. He's trying to block or tackle Max Crosby. And Crosby still is able to hold that edge. You can see him. He's trying to get him off, and he's holding him. But the best thing he did is he forced him back to the inside, to the teeth of that defense. Atwell's 5'9", 165. It was actually Powell who's 5'8", 181. The third and 13. and timeout is taken. So you go back to that first and ten the number 45 for the Rams and it was fun to talk to him about going up against his former team last week. He had a lot of energy and a lot of production against the Seahawks. He kind of said, well maybe they thought it was too old on the other side of 30. He proved the other day he wasn't too old. He said there was some fun trash talk going back and forth and he said it just lit his fire early in the game. Hall of Fame type career for him. No question about that from the 25-yard line. Carr in the pocket under pressure and knocked away. So Ramsey tries to get it into Adams. And let's check in with Kaylee. What you got? Well, Al, earlier we saw the Raiders right guard Alex Bars get rolled up on. We're now told he's questionable to return because of a knee. We saw his right knee get taped up while he was in the medical tent on the sidelines, but he has since left the field, gone back into the locker room. There's John Simpson on the field in his place. Simpson, yeah, he hadn't played an offensive snap since week two. Simpson, a third-year guy out of Clemson. Picked him in the fourth round a couple of years back. Second down and 10 now from the 25-yard line. And on the end of the round, here comes Mack Hollins. Big gainer there, gain of 17 yards from Mack Hollins, who at the moment, with Renfro out and Wilder out at tight end, he'd be their number two receiver. Yeah, and again, these edges are a big concern. You'll see Hoyt up on the edge here. He's a 300-pound defensive tackle because of injuries, has had to move to the edge. They didn't even have to block him. Murrow goes right around him because he collapses down. A guy that's learning a new position loses the edge of the defense, In the end round, there's nobody there, so easy for first down yardage. Again, Johnson in his fullback, helping to lead the way, and Jacobs to the 45-yard line on his eighth carry of the game. Daniel Hardy making the tackle. I love that you're talking about Matt Collins because really he's been a special teams guy throughout his career and had a good career in college at North Carolina, but this is his first real opportunity coming over from Miami to get a chance to show what he can do opposite of Devontae Adams. And with the injuries to Waller and Renfro, like you said, he sure has taken advantage of it. Part of that Eagle team that won the Super Bowl over the Patriots back in Minneapolis after the 17th season. Second and seven. Carr stepping up. Throws. Again, he finds the same man. That's Max Hollins making the catch. And a first down at the L.A. 40-yard line. That is a heck of a job with this offensive line. The area that they feel that they've grown the most. Even with the injury. See that Simpson's in there. He's holding his own. And it's a great job by Derek Carr stepping up. And Mack Hollins just sits in a soft spot of the zone. There's a lot of voids behind the linebackers in front of the safeties over the last few weeks in this Rams defense. And they're able to capitalize on it here early. All Raiders to this point. This is their 17th play. The Rams have run three. Again, the workhorse for a gain of about four. Interesting thing. They didn't pick up his fifth-year option. We're talking about Jacobs. So what happens? Can you make a long-term deal with him? Do you franchise tag him? It'll be interesting. Yeah, that'll be one of the two things I envision happening. But he bets on himself, and he has a chance to really have this big year. It's great to see. What a great young man as far as his approach coming out of Alabama. Had to wait his turn there like a lot of backs do. And just plays with incredible intensity and intelligence at that position. Aaron Judge did okay for betting on himself, huh? No doubt. Second and six. Pressure. Gets it away. And the tackle is made. Out in the flat by Scott. Johnson makes the catch. Back to Kaylee. We go. Al, Josh Jacobs told me he saw other people. panicking when the Raiders didn't pick up his fifth year option. But like Kirk said, he's focusing on this opportunity in front of him. He told me it excites him at 24 years old to be able to control his own destiny. And he did not hesitate to say to me he wants to be a Raider. And he believes he's doing everything he needs to on and off the field to make that a reality, guys. And we'll see what happens. It'll be very interesting for the moment he's out here on third down with Abdullah in as the third down back. and the Raiders will take a timeout with 3.06 remaining in the opening quarter. So it's hard to tell what the crowd is right now. I think mainly Raiders a little bit, but you have a PA announcer here who incessantly screams whose house. You love it. No, I hate it. He wants to say, he wants them to say, by Baker Mayfield over the shoulder, and there's a concentration by Jefferson. I love. It's a team that's lost six in a row. They're 3-9. They've had more injuries than anybody. There he is again. We saw this in Carolina. We did that Carolina-Atlanta game. And thank goodness he didn't wind up in concussion protocol that night. I mean, think about this. Carolina says, hey, no, you're an active. You're our third quarterback. He comes in here and he does this thing. Unreal. You've done a few games in your time, honestly. I'm not trying to make this more than it is. Has the league ever seen anything like this after two days of being in a town? Not too many quarterbacks have come in on two days' notice. Not too many quarterbacks have come in on two days' notice, period. After the game, Google Pixel postgame show, exclusively on Prime Video. I'm sure Baker Mayfield will wind up on the set. than TNF nightgap, a preview of Sunday's NFL slate. And again, this guy's been made fun of. He's been ridiculed. I mean, he's a polarizing figure for so many people. And for him to just kind of keep fighting the fight. He'll be doing a commercial with SoFi as his new home. Oh, man. Too good. He's trying to get in the locked gate. The Letterman. Here's Carr. Any magic here? No. Taylor Rapp to seal it. And for the Raiders, this is going to be a devastating loss for a team that was on the cusp of at least getting back into some semblance of a playoff hunt. But instead of 6-7, they're going to find it. This is a new thing now with Mayfield. Head-butting guys with helmets. And while we're caught up in the heroics of Mayfield and the Rams, they're going to snap that six-game losing streak. This Raiders team that had won three in a row and started the year two and seven, they were thinking about possibly getting into the postseason. They controlled this game. Just a devastating loss and another close loss. seven of eight of their losses by one possession now. For the Rams, in a thoroughly forgettable season, an extremely memorable win. Fourth loss this season after leading by 13 or more. They can't close out the Rams. Baker Mayfield living a dream. And they've turned this stadium, at least for the Rams fans, into fantasy land tonight. That just doesn't happen. Ever. No. You're seeing something I don't know if anybody's ever seen. And Baker Mayfield's going to get a lot of attention. But we kept talking about Raheem Morris and his defense. And they also deserve a lot of recognition for keeping him in this football game when it looked like they didn't have much of a chance. No doubt. You saw it tonight. Here's a guy who was the number one overall pick back in 2018. You know, had his moments in Cleveland. Then he goes to, you know, Carolina. first quarterback in the era in the Super Bowl to lead a 13-point comeback in his debut with two different teams. Big slag. Yeah. Ho-hum. Yep. Ho-hum. Who's your star in the game, by the way? It's like a boxing match where they're just kind of hanging on keeping their offense and his team within striking distance. Both drives of the Raiders in this half have been three and outs. A little dump off here. Some room here. Stand in bounds long enough to set up a third. And short goes Jacobs, who skips out of bounds there. He used his right hand there to deflect the defender. And he came up kind of shaking his hand just by using that stiff arm there. This was during the last commercial, after those two three and outs. McDaniels, he wasn't joshing. Well, that's what we just talked about. Their first three series points on the board. And since then, nothing. So third down now, third and two. Johnson the fullback. Jacobs finding a crease. Moves the sticks. Takes it to the 37-yard line on carry number 21 for him. And it's incredible that he's working through this. And even coming into this game tonight, he's dealing with some nagging injuries. And now he's got that right hand that's bothering him. And he put a stiff arm on the previous play and just came up. You could tell how sensitive that hand is. And he's a tough runner that runs between the tackles. I mean, this could be a long fourth quarter for him. Final minute of the third. Carr. Pressure. Chased. Throws and throws it away. Chased that time by Copeland. And Hoyt. Second and ten with 25 seconds. This gives you an idea how much pain he's dealing with. That looks like a routine stiff arm. And then right away, look at his face. I mean, you can tell the kind of pain he's dealing with. of the grimace when he put that stiff arm out on him second down and 10 right now from the 37-yard line Jacobs to the 29 third down and a couple wrap and he'll make the tackle and That's going to take us to the fourth quarter. So that was a scoreless third period. And a ten-point game as we start the fourth quarter. Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit. Haley Hartung third down and two. For the Raiders here. And the Rams are able to get the stop. Jacobs can't go anywhere. Leonard Floyd is there, and they got fourth and short. Really good job of Floyd and also Ernest Jones getting off of the potential block by Colton Miller. Watch this off to the edge on the right. 54 is able to kind of hold his point. And the Raiders line up to go for it. Get the same group out there. And then Carr will take it himself and pick up the first down. Got up there, looked like just for a second they were trying to draw him offside. And Carr takes it himself. First down. Yeah, got right behind Andre James. And usually the modern sneak, you see running backs get in there tight behind the quarterback and help push him for the first down. But here he just kind of went to the bubble, went to the soft spot behind the center and got everything that he needed there for the first down. So the Raiders, instead of trying to get up by 16-3, They're trying to go for a potential knockout punch here. Trying to turn it into a three-score game to the 21-yard line. So, Pachinko's nothing spectacular tonight, but he's talking about the ultimate workhorse in the worksheet. 24 carries for 90 yards. The long was 15, shaking that hand again. He's showing the durability. It's the fourth straight game. Think about other offenses. The style of offenses. Four straight games with over 20 carries. And eventually he's got nine more yards to be over 100 yards for the fourth straight time. Carr. Fires over the middle. That's incomplete. Adams that time. He intended to shoot. He's had a nice night with two long grabs. Fans were yelling about it. He doesn't grab onto the face mask. His hands are there. Terry giving us the wave off. Good no call. And no gain. Second down and ten. Mayfield throwing a little bit low. The Raiders say no. And so the officials. Skoranek, the intended receiver, will be third down and ten. Yeah, it's a position that Baker in this offense has been in, unfortunately, quite a bit. Especially in the second half. the ball's either going to have to come out fast or you're going to have to move the pocket because here's Crosby and Jones are going to tee off on those offensive tackles what are you saying? whose house is it? at the moment it's the Raiders house and not even an Airbnb this time third down and ten Mayfield in the pocket to the outside Reaching up, grabbing it Inbounds 2-2 Atwell, so a huge 3rd and 10 Completion, they'll spot the ball at the 11 yard line I think that right tackle Havenstein gets away with one You knew it was coming, you better get the ball out fast Watch how he grabs onto him Around the neck Somehow Baker Mayfield still gets this ball off and Havenstein who's had a rough night in these third and long situations does not get the call and a heck of a route and combination there with Baker Mayfield and 2-2 Atwell. Caught. Atwell again. Stays on his feet. Takes the ball down inside the 8-yard line. Tackled there by Hobbs with 5.45 remaining in regulation. Giving themselves a chance here. And Atwell has become the go-to guy. Really been coming on in recent weeks. Allen Robinson, of course, Cooper Cup. Down, you've got to turn to the next wave of receivers. And it's been Atwell, who's, again, 5'6", 165 pounds out there making plays. Got a glimpse of Cooper Cup. Big-time Super Bowl for him last year. Ball handed off here to the five-yard line. Cam Akers third down, third and four Raiders making this offense have to earn it, right? Making them drive, eat the clock, not giving up the big play You're pretty much compelled, I think, on fourth down here You have to get a turn in one possession game Field goal with ten points It's only two possessions probably have two shots in it here. Third down and four. Mayfield stepping up, stepping away. Throws caught. And that's going to be Brown. Malcolm Brown is a yard short of the first down. So can the Rams basically stay alive here? It's going to be fourth and one at the two. How in the world is Baker Mayfield executing down in this red area that is so tough to do with Crosby, who's relentless chasing him down. He's hanging on to him, and he gets the ball off. Are you kidding me? Fourth and one. Clock now under four minutes. Brown in the backfield And a timeout Taken here by the Rams So they're down to their last one Well we started the night And said you know it's kind of like Mystery theater We didn think Mayfield would play This much But he has and again they got 11 days before their next game so you probably see him on Monday Night Football at Green Bay away from Monday just to put it in perspective you and I had a speaking engagement on Tuesday nights so normally I come in on Wednesdays for our games you live here in town I had to fly in of course I got here before Baker Mayfield got here and he's out there learning an offense in two days And he's dealing with Crosby, and John Wolford has sure tried to help him as much as he could these last couple days. He's kept his helmet on before Wolford started the game, played one series, and, you know, dying to get back in. Meanwhile, fourth and one. Can Mayfield keep it alive? It's caught, and forward progress will net him. It should net him the first down. Yeah, he has it. He does. He gets it inside the one-yard line. So Akers in the offensive backfield. It's going to be a hold. On Haven's side again. Offense, number 79. Penalty is declined. Fourth down. Well, you're trying to block Crosby, and here's what you have to do. Yeah, when it's third down and he knows it's a pass, he's either going to beat you or he's going to force a hold. I mean, again, I don't know if there's another defensive end playing as well as he is as far as total package. And who's, again, a guy that commits himself, you know, with food prep seven days a week, stretches every night, sleep. I mean, he is completely engaged in being a dominant player, and he wants to be the best that this league has to offer. Dixon, his three punts have averaged 52 tonight. Another flag. Return from the 23-yard line. I think the Raiders may have jumped. Rams have not caught a break tonight. Will this be their first break? Well, it was fourth down and three. There you go. Here's your evidence, Your Honor. Sean McVay's got to be thinking, come on, man. Just give it. Give us a break. Come on. You've got a second flag as well. The Raiders. The Raiders. Return team number 27. That penalty has declined. Offside. Defense. That five-yard penalty results in a first down. So a fourth and three becomes a first down. Give them some life here in a 13-point game with 10.53 left in the fourth. Pearl is the guy who jumped offside Former number one pick out of Clemson back in 2019 So can the Rams take advantage of this now As they have a first down of the 38-yard line Mayfield fires over the middle open, caught inside the 45 goes Van Jefferson and another penalty all over the joint holding number 68 10 yard penalty first down Tyenseki the 37 year old left tackle who's been everywhere man a marina league Canadian league bunch of practice squads came over from Indian October Well, we've seen Crosby create the holds. And now on the other side, Jones, who had three sacks last week, trying to get their Baker Mayfield. And then Secky now losing that outside edge. He grabs on to the jersey. Again, this offense going backwards. Kevin Carberry is the offensive line coach. Not a happy man right now. Seven penalties on the Rams tonight. They've been killers for the most part for 60 yards. so in a first and 20 set up a screen here to Williams and he gets tacked on the open field up at the 39 yard line by Denzel Perryman second and 10 now for a 10 yard gain yeah even a small thing like that from Baker Mayfield just being here in a short time a screen pass a lot of that is about selling it and the timing pretty good execution there to get some positive yards now Mayfield goes no huddle with them and that's hauled in by Skoranek over the middle. So he turned the first and 20 into a second and 10, and then another first down in Raiders territory. So he's going to go hurry up, and he's going to face a blitz. I mean, look at this. These guys are walked up, and he's in a hurry up in a new offense that he really doesn't quite know, and he throws a seed for a first down. It's almost like Baker is better off not thinking and just put the football in his hands, let him know an idea of the direction of these routes, and then just let it rip. Just make the complicated simple at a certain point. In the 48-yard line, Mayfield hit as he throws, and that's incomplete. Trying to make a circus catch with Atwell. Chandler Jones put the heat on, second down and ten. If you're a Raiders fan, you've got to love to see the way Chandler Jones is trending these last few weeks. I mentioned how I think Tillery and the inside is helping because it's creating one-on-one opportunities for him and Crosby. That's why the Tillery pickup was so big. But with the length that he has, the experience, almost reinventing himself where he had so much twitch for most of his career. Tackled there by Merrick, but has enough. Here's the line and the shot. The yellow line grabs it. Forward progress. But Philly has it. And they come to the line right now on a first and goal. And this is Akers into the end zone. Does he get in there? The Rams say yes. And the Raiders, who haven't stopped the first and goal in about 14 years seemingly, give up another one here. Wow. The fourth down call with a new quarterback. He's got to go over Chandler Jones and make that throw. Heck of an effort by Cam Akers, by the way, to secure the catch and get just enough. Yeah, the ball does get across for the first down. They go hurry up, and they get six finally on the board. Here's your TD. Just does get it to the goal line and in. That ball must have somehow gotten across. They must be taking a peek at that. They are. All scoring plays are reviewed. Stafford going over things with Mayfield. Enjoying the moment. It's crazy. It really is. Matthew's like, dude, what are you doing out there? How are you doing this? Still looking at it. It was a heck of an effort whether he gets in or not. Let's see. His body's twisting. It's all about where that ball is. You can see he gets pushed back, but it's just about whether or not it's like they cleared it. Yep, they did. They did. So now to try to make it a six-point lead, Matt Gay. So the Rams finally get into the end zone. Took them almost 57 minutes. It's 16-10 with 319 to go. Meanwhile, you got the Rams expecting an onside, or the Raiders expecting an onside kick here. Guarding against it, but Gay will send it through the end zone, and to the 25 they start this drive. Now it's time for our 4K Sky Camp, presented by Avatar The Way of Water. Fired up for that one myself. Let's look at Max Crosby. Boy, what a game he has had. What a year he has had in just a relentless approach, whether it's rushing to quarterback, being able to be instinctive and athletic with that length that he has and knocking the ball down. There's that relentless approach that he has as a pass rusher, just all in all just doing everything he can to be the cornerstone, along with Chandler Jones on the other side of this defense. Jacobs in the backfield. Next carry will be his 25th. And there it is. You bottled him up. You know, pretty all things considered, I mean, the Rams defense good against the run. They don't have Aaron Donald. He's carried 25 times, but for less than four yards of carry. So they've done a pretty good job. They've done a remarkable job. Again, think about the offense that they're going up against. I mean, these last three or four weeks, they've been putting up big numbers. They're a top ten offense in the league. Rams used that final timeout. You have the two-minute warning. And again, I'm going to give Raheem Morris and his defense a lot of credit after giving up some points early. They really buckled down, made some adjustments, and kept him in this game to give him this chance here late. Illuminor is back in the game. Last game played in the league was three nights ago, Monday Night Football, where Tom Brady was down 16-3 with about three and change to go and won the game with three seconds to go. Rams will see if they can duplicate that. First, they've got to get the ball back, though. Second down and nine. They've got everybody up at that line of scrimmage. Johnson, the fullback, helping to lead the way. And that's a big game for Jacobs, setting up a third down and one. This is that 21 personnel with Johnson, an obvious running situation. You know they're going to do it. It's old school ISO block. I mean, when was the last time you heard anybody talk about an iso block? Watch the fullback taking on that linebacker, Jones. That's an offense from the 80s. But it's a mentality, and it's an outlier, and it's tough for NFL defenses. Meanwhile, stop at the line of scrimmages. Jacobs snapped it quickly. McDaniel. That was a nine-yard sack. Pending. After the play, unsportsmanlike conduct, number 90 of the defense, knocking the ball out of the quarterback's hand. That's a 15-yard penalty and an automatic touchdown. Oh, boy, Jerry Tillery. Great job again. We've seen this matchup all night with Crosby and Havenstein. Able to point, keeps it with that length, keeps him off of him. Jones meets him, and then this is well after the play right there. Tillery knocks the ball out of the hands. Remember, they're out of timeouts. It's an obvious penalty. so up to the 28 yard line to give them more light deep down the sideline and it is caught by Skoranek Ben Skoranek with a great catch a contested catch all the way to the 40 yard line how about the throw couldn't be any better coverage and somehow he gets that into Skoranek to give him a chance, and Skoranek fights him for that football. Under a minute. 32-yard gain. Underneath. Here's Brown to the 31-yard lane. Get up, get it down, get to the line of scrimmage. Again, just learning this offense. Now he's got this two-minute. Make sure everybody's on the same page. Second and one. 35, 34, 33. Mayfield throws. That's caught. That's a first down here. Skoranek to the 22. Now Mayfield gets up there. He's got to spike it here. Get him set. Get him lined up. Don't have a false start. Don't have an illegal formation. He gets you down with 15 seconds. This is pretty amazing, I've got to tell you. Yeah, it is. It is. I mean, just to watch this execution is fascinating. This is a heck of a throw. Great coverage by Nate Hobbs. Puts the ball where Skoranek can go up. Hobbs never really sees it. And how about the job by Skoranek? Second year out of Notre Dame. Gets both hands on it and fights and pulls it away from Hobbs as they hit the ground. Mayfield's new favorite receiver. Seven receptions, 90 yards. None bigger than that one. second and ten Mayfield to the end oh to Jefferson is that possible? touchdown touchdown this is impossible they go 98 yards that's good for 23 that's there is a new leading man in Hollywood holy mackerel This is unbelievable. Sean McVay's energy says it all down there. All the pressure right now is on Matt Gay to try to, in effect, win it with nine seconds, and the Raiders call the timeout. I mean, this is silly stuff. It is. It really is. This is a really good call. You've got Atwell right here who can work to the inside. Baker is locked in right here on the safety. Watch the movement by Daron Harmon. It's a snap of the football. He works to the middle of the field, meaning, okay, I've got a shot here. It one-on-one to the left. Takes it, and again, the accuracy downfield with receivers he's never thrown with. We saw it with Skoranek, and now we see it with Van Jefferson makes the play. Gave for the lead. 17-16 Los Angeles. Some Browns fans are saying right now, come home. Come home. Come back. Yeah, man, good for Baker Mayfield, man. Wow. He's been through so much in Cleveland and in Carolina, and now here in L.A. Let's go back to Jefferson, who, again, has only played in six games. He's missed six games this year, fighting back from a knee injury. That one-on-one matchup against Sam Webb, the rookie, and he beats him. Pretty tight coverage, but a perfectly thrown ball. Now he's using more technique, hands, second and third moves, and more power. Second and ten. Pass is underthrown a little bit, but there is Skoranek. Still on his feet, fighting. Gets to the 43-yard line. Making the 42. Making the third down. Skoranek making some plays tonight. You know, we thought Atwell and Powell would be the guys with Cooper Cup down. Did he make the grab here? Yeah, does a good job. You saw McVay say, hurry it up. We don't want a challenge. and did they get the flag out and they did. So he saw the replay, did McDaniels, shoots the flag out. That's why McVay wanted him to hurry things up. And our first challenge of the night. The challenge is in the previous play of an incomplete pass. Well, I think initially he had his hands under and then as he started to fall to the ground. 8.41 remaining in the fourth. Get the call and we come back. Call is a completed pass. The whole deal is if you have control, we're talking to Terry McCullough during the break here, if you control it before it hits the ground, which he appears to do here, even though the ball hits the ground, it's a completion. So we expect that this call will stand as a completed pass. correct ament ament a Terry yep absolutely going on the field stands Las Vegas has been charged to timeout Terry and an unsuccessful challenge I think sometimes fans see the ball hit the ground and they just say okay that's an incompletion but what Al just said you had told us at the break the control is able to keep that as a reception and it's just a is it a subjective decision on control? It is. He's got to get control, a firm grasp of the ball, which he did there, and then he maintained control after he hit the ground. That's the other aspect of it. Got it. Thanks. So it holds. Third down and four now. Malcolm Brown is in the backfield. Mayfield, who's played the entire game after the first series, and the Raiders come across and they stop the play. So this will result... 98 defense. Five-yard penalty. So that's the second first down via penalty on this drive. Allen's head. Crosby is trying to get an indicator of when he just kind of guesses. Once that head goes down, you've been seeing the ball snapped most often tonight. and this time he gives him a freeze and Crosby jumps. And Havenstein says, thank God, not me. Akers back in the backfield. 8.41 left in the fourth. Akers. Nice move to the 30. He goes second down and three. Stopped there by Nate Hobbs. And you saw him can, can the call, meaning kill it and keep it on. And he saw what he needed to see to give this offensive line the blocking angles that they needed. And that's what the Rams would hope to do all night, is find angles where they can help their offensive line and run the football and mix in the play action. They do not want to be back in that pocket the way they have most of the night against Crosby and Jones. Second and a long two just inside the 30-yard line. gets it away, caught, and it's going to be a first down. Tight end, Tyler Higbee. Let's drive now. Nine plays, 51 yards, seven of those have been passes. Again, really impressive job here. You run the football. It sets up that boot action that Baker Mayfield is really comfortable in doing. He's not just a guy throwing from the pocket. He likes to get out on the edge. But how about that throw that time to Higbee? He had to work that around Chandler Jones to make that throw. Mayfield, now 12 out of 22 for 130 yards. To the left he goes. And stopped right there. And Steranek wants a face mask hold on Masterson. The official says, no, sir. They have an injury tonight to Jayon Brown. John Brown is a guy that plays the ball in coverage really well. And Masterson has had to step up. The rookie out of Wake Forest. That's what the... He's going to only shake his head, and the Rams had to have a stop. And they do. And the clock will tick all the way down out of the two-minute warning. The Rams don't have a timeout. Morris and his defense again. Like you said, it was a sugar huddle. They tried to hide Jacobs up as a fullback and just sneak it in there. but great penetration by Bobby Wagner and company to get into the backfield. So here's your two-minute warning. On the other side of the break, it'll be fourth down and one. Both these linebackers were able to shoot gaps and be able to get into the backfield. Here's Jacobs usually lined up as a tailback. Devontae Adams back there, but Wagner and his partner Ernest Jones not fooled at all. And with those offensive linemen occupied by D-Lyman, they're able to penetrate and push him back. They've been good on those third and shorts and fourth and shorts tonight. No question. Got to get the ball back. Week from tonight, up north we go. Be in Seattle. Big game in the NFC West. Meanwhile, the punting group comes on. Seattle against San Francisco next Thursday night. A.J. Cole comes in for his third punt. With Brandon Powell setting up for a return at a 17. Gets it away. Angles it to the far side. It's a nice roll for the Raiders. It skims the sideline. Look at that. and downed inside the five-yard line. It bounced around a 20 or so. It looked like it was about ready to go out, and it's a 64-yard punt putting the Rams into position. They have to go the length of the field here without a sign-up, 145. What a weapon. Like you said, Powell thinks it's going to go out of bounds. It stays in bounds and just keeps rolling. Now, who could have thought this tonight? Baker Mayfield shows up on Tuesday night to Los Angeles to learn a new offense. Gets into the game, ends up staying in the game, and now he's 98 yards with a minute 45 and no timeouts away for having a chance to win it. Hollywood, baby, send in the strip. Let's see what happens. They took another five seconds off the clock as well, that punt. To the outside. Reaching up. No, he's out of bounds. Atwell. It'll be second down and ten from the two. Got the right foot down, unable to get the left foot down. It would have just given him some positive yards and a little bit more room to work with. Keep in mind, just in town a couple days and he's trying to learn a new offense and timing and rhythm with new receivers. And now you're in a two-minute offense situation where things move really fast. Mayfield from his own end zone caught. That's going to set up a third and short Atwell. Out past the 10-yard line to the 11, stopping the clock with a minute and 37. He goes right back to it. This time he puts a little bit more on this ball. See, look at the accuracy on that throw. On third and one, look out. Mayfield hit as he throws, and that is intercepted with a flag, though. I see it. Is it Harmon who intercepts? Meanwhile, Mayfield is saying it's against the Raiders, and here comes the call from Brad Rogers. Good route by Van Jefferson. Pass interference. Defense number 21. All plays on the start of the foul. Automatic touchdown. Foul is on Amik Robertson. The route by 12. Jefferson draws this. See him in a slot, grabbing on already. Then once he makes that move to the outside, he just pulls on his arm. So a great call to gate that interception. And there's the pass rush, by the way, that he's got to continue to deal with. They blitzed Denzel Perryman, not to mention Jones and Crosby off the edge. 90 seconds. Have to go 78 yards. Mayfield look out, down he goes slam down for the sack who else? double X they both got in there Crosby got in there and Jones on a stunt flag down at the 16 third down and seven really good job by Bobby Wagner there in coverage I think he knew pre-snap that he was trying to find that glance route, trying to throw the football to his favorite target, Adams, and he just kind of gets into that throwing lane. Watch him work to his left, and it forces the quarterback car to have to come off of it. Well, there's your right tackle, Jermaine Palumino. They work on him. Step aside. Everyone loves an underdog story. You know why? Because it fills you with hope. It makes you believe. Why music begins. You've got that song in your head, don't you? I do. Meanwhile, there's a luminor. Now you've got the right guard who's been taking out Alex Bars, and we've got a backup John Simpson in for him. And now a rookie, Thayer Munford, comes in for a luminor. So you've got a couple rookies now with the left guard and the right tackle. And a big play for the Rams here. Third down and seven. That Rams defense. trying to keep it a two-possession game. Protection is good. There's a dart that's incomplete. Right there, or Abdul actually was able to hold it in. He falls it into the 18, but well short of the first down. It's going to be fourth down and three, and now Carlson will come in and try to make it a 13-point lead. Good job again by the Rams. I mean, they're giving up some plays, giving up some yards. Remember that drive started after that missed field goal. Started on their side of the 50s. Doing everything they can to try to keep this team in the game. Yeah, a 10-play drive to this point. But not that much yardage as Carlson banks that one straight down the middle. So there are the first points for either side in the second half. Bobby Wagner, the veteran in his 11th year, who's been instrumental with a lot of the injuries around him, has had a big night in keeping this Rams defense competitive. You've seen him against the run. That time, O'Lang Johnson on the block. Also in coverage, a number of times he's been able to make plays in space here knowing exactly where the first down marker is, and he keeps Derek Carr out of it. And look at him here. He's going to want airborne. This guy's going to give you every single thing that he has. And keep in mind, he's in his 11th year, 32-year-old, playing great football. Yeah, let him go, but he grew up in nearby Ontario. 13.2% defensive stop rate tonight, according to NextGenStats powered by AWS. What an impressive guy. You know, we had a chance to visit with him this week. I mean, he's got the eye of the tiger, really. Just a pro's pro in his approach and how he tries to be a leader as a first-year guy. And with the injuries around him, he's had to become even more vocal. Catches old mates next week on Thursday night. Go to Seattle against San Francisco. As this kick here will bounce through the end zone. And we go to Kaylee. The ball at Utah State. same draft that produced Russell Wilson a decade ago brought in Wagner as well we're on the ramps here with Akers as the running back Kyron Williams is the running back and the pass is caught out in the flat and about a 6 yard gain here for Tyler Higby the tight end again for people just tuning in we're watching Baker Mayfield in just a couple days of trying to consume Sean McVay's offense as much of it as he can. And he had a great start, you know, when he came in for John Wolford, hitting a lot of throws. Second half, not as good. Now he's got himself in a 13-point hole in the fourth quarter. Second and five. Over the left side. Hit hard as he crosses the line of scrimmage. now Peckto was there to take Williams down and it's third down and three now I don't know what was crazier hearing the news that Baker Mayfield was heading to the Rams are seeing I was curious is he going to wear six I didn't know what number he'd be in and here he is in 17 apparently there was the only skilled position number available there it is almost looks like a 77 and they made that overnight third and three Mayfield and that's incomplete coverage is good at well the intended receiver and a penalty in
