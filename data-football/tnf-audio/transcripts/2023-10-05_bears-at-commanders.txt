 FedEx Field, the coaches, first of all, the ways to watch. We can tell you other ways to watch. Prime Vision with Next Gen Stats. That broadcast, we're in Spanish with TNN Espanyol. Everybody's always talking about a coach on Hachigulus. Fourteen in a row. Obviously, the street is very hot, Matt. Iber Flew, second year, mark of 3-18. Trying to get into the win column tonight. His counterpart, Ron Rivera. He's coaching in his fourth season here, formerly of Carolina. And, of course, he played for the Chicago Bears and was part of the great Bears teams in the mid-'80s. Two quarterbacks, of course. You've got Justin Fields, who was a first-rounder in his third season. And this could be a season to determine very much what his future will be as he comes to midfield for the point. But Sam Howell, thirdly, fifth-round pick. Normally, a fifth-round pick is not a guy you think is going to be a franchise quarterback you can only hope. Interesting, Ron Rivera, after his only start a year ago as a rookie at last game against Dallas, came out in January and said, this is our guy. We're moving forward into next year. I think a lot of people thought they may potentially draft another quarterback. Instead, they went with Sam Howe. Now, four games in, he showed some signs of Commanders fans being very excited about his potential in this new scheme. And we'll see how he gets off tonight out to a good start. They had Carson Wentz. That didn't work out. Taylor Heineke did a decent job. He's gone. So then this season, it was a matter of whether Jacoby Brissett, who they picked up, or Howell won the job in mid-August. The job belongs to Howell. He has demonstrated a lot of poise here these last couple weeks. Buffalo got after him for nine sacks. He bounced back against Philly and showed a lot of poise and a loss, a close loss to the Eagles on the road. Nice night just outside the District of Columbia. Temperature is 70 degrees. Light breeze. Joey slide a kickoff. Bayless Jones back to receive at FedEx Field. Home of this franchise since 1997. And off we go. Week 5 is underway with a touchback. So Fields coming off his best performance of his career last week, certainly in the first half. And then the second half, a whole other story with a very costly fumble, an interception, but overall there were the numbers. Four TDs, the pick, only 25 rushing yards for a guy who's been in triple figures on occasion. Yeah, last year over 1,000 yards rushing, and you know what we saw last week is he made quick decisions. They got him out on the edge, they threatened with his legs, and he was able to complete his first 16 passes. They got him in rhythm early. Likes to line up, as is the case here in the pistol. The fake to Herbert. Retreats as time goes deep. And off the hands of Darnell Mooney, who'd beaten this man. So Mooney got out in front, just couldn't handle it. And it'll be second down and ten. This offensive line, obviously, like most, performed better when they have a chance to be first and ten play action. You see you get one-on-one opportunity. A clean pocket takes a shot and just can't quite hit his number one target a year ago, Darnell Mooney. but this is what they're looking for. Luke Getsky loved the call here, taking that shot. He had him one-on-one and he got behind coverage. Be Kendall Fuller keeping on the ground. Herbert goes nowhere. Montez Sweat making the tackle there. It'll be third down and nine so another guy under the gun has been Luke Getsky, the Bears offensive coordinator. He again trying to in a way It will revamp what Fields does and what the offense does. Yeah, just trying to find that rhythm. Keep it in mind, they've got a rookie right tackle and their two starters on the left side over these last couple weeks, left guard and left tackle not playing. So it's made it tougher to get Fields into that rhythm. They go three by one here. Rooney in motion. That's a great front four for Washington, but the line does it. Jarvin opened and making the catch. Inside the 30-yard line, D.J. Moore. So they miss fire on the first one, but hit the second one. Lined at its job. Fields stayed in the pocket, 57 yards over Benjamin St. Juiced. The pocket. When the pocket is clean, like any quarterback, Justin Fields especially, he's growing as a pocket quarterback. You see how clean the pocket is there. What he does is he does a good job of reading. Here we go. Pressure. And that's Tawson. Moore gets back into the action after that super first half. D.J. Moore had eight catches last week tonight after a quick five. His first one since early in the second, six targets, six catches. The adjustments Jack Del Rio has made is more movement with that front. They weren't able to win in the first half. He's adding linebackers now and blitzing that time with Jamin Davis. 3rd and 5 Fields under pressure Escapes again Throws a little bit low And it's Herbert there Does not make the grab Incomplete Got rid of it Threw it too low Fourth down And Herbert is down He bent backwards The pressure is by Chase Young out here. Fields does a good job of stepping up away from the pressure. And then he's a threat to run. And it puts Davis in a tough spot. He takes Fields. And that's where you worry about Herbert there. You have to bend backwards to try to make that catch. And still work on Fields as we take a break. Trenton Gill sending it skyward. 11-yard line. Jamison Crowder trying to go around the left side, able to turn the corner and turn it into a decent runback. Nine and a half left in the third. And Washington with a quick drive, three minutes to score and get the two-point diversion. At it again. Whatever the commanders, the players said to each other, obviously Ron Rivera's got to be excited with the idea and the concept and the energy that they have come out here with. Offense goes right down the field. Five plays and a touchdown. Defense gets the Bears offense off the field. And just like that, they got the football back. Nine and a half minutes here to go in the third quarter. Got the ball out underneath. Screen game. Last drive. Four-man rush. Gets it away. pick up six or seven on that first down play. They go to Logan Thomas one more time. He's been the main man. Seven targets, seven catches for 56. Eric Bien-Ami loves what he's seeing. His quarterback is following the orders of, hey, they're going to take away everything downfield. Let's send those receivers downfield. Let's open things up for our tight ends and our backs out of the backfield. empty here go five wide second and three how fires that's caught it's going to be a first down here catches made thomas the ball comes out chicago thinks they have it and they do carol smith comes away with it that's the ruling on the Field, obviously, gets checked out. So Thomas struggling, straining for the extra yardage, winds up costing him. Yeah, and Greg Stroman's trying to get at the ball, but I think it was the rookie Smith, as you said, not just coming up with it. Stroman's in there knocking it away, but I think it's 32 with his right hand right there, pulls away to get that ball dislodged, and then right there, presence of mind to jump on it. How about the rookie out of Minnesota, four-year starter in college, presence of mind to be aware that we got a shot to get this football out and they do. Forrest Wumble, Wumble recovery. They've checked it out. It's kosher and they have it at the 46 yard line. 22. Way to go. Got up with a tight formation here. Field survey. He's going to go in his own territory. That time Jonathan Allen got there to get the sack. Jonathan Allen lined up on the left side of this offensive line. And really good work here of being able to not give up on the play. He's handled there initially, but that swim move gets him through. And then he just picks up Justin Fields, who's 230 pounds, picks him up and pile drives him into the ground. You know, there's so much sensing the safety coming down. Once he saw the safety come down, realized he had a one-on-one opportunity. St. Jude gets it lost in coverage, and he makes them pay. 58 yards officially. Longest completion of the season. Moore came over in the trade. Meanwhile, a timeout is taken here just a minute and a half into the game. So he'll go to the bench, discuss it with Getzy. But you've got to, you know, hey, what do you have to lose? You're 0-4, you start with a bomb. You misfire, you come back with another bomb, and you hit it. It shows the confidence that they have hit him. This looks like a safety that's going to drop, right? With the snap of the ball, he comes down. Justin Fields recognizes that. Once he starts to sink, now he knows. He recognizes that. Now he knows he's got exactly what he wants. As I said, St. Jude's 25 just kind of gets lost there in coverage. You don't know if that's a bust or what, but obviously he should not be running three like that on third down. It's a one-two punch. That's right. Fields to Moore. Herbert to back. Fields under center. Herbert. Nothing. Again, you're going up against that front four of Washington. You've got Allen. You've got Payne. You've got Sweat. You've got Young. All of them number one draft choices. Yeah, even John Ridgway, who's out there pushing people around 91, I mean, they can consume offensive linemen. Allows their linebackers to get downhill. It really frees up the back end when you have a dominant front like that for Jack Del Rio, the defensive coordinator. second and ten from the 16-yard line fields look out under pressure Danny goes 21-yard line Montez Sweat coming in that's his fourth sack of the season setting up third and long this is their fear you know you think you're gonna have to chip tonight against these ends right is is a it's just a rookie he's trying to hold on for dear life against a very underrated defensive end people talk a lot about Chase Young Duron Payne, Jonathan Allen. Sometimes you overlook the game-changing ability of Montez Sweat against the run and here getting that great pass rush off the edge. 18 sacks, second most in the league, third and 14. Four-man rush again. Fields to the end zone. Moore! Touchdown! so fields are at the big first half last week 20 yards here down the field they go more catches two passes six plays 75 yards in a little less than three minutes and chicago draws first blood well watch percy butler this safety when you have a vertical receiver against two safeties that are high the linebackers got to be able to get vertical Watch the safety be influenced here, and that creates the opening to the outside. Again, give Justin Fields a lot of credit. That throw should not be there if the safety's doing his job. And again, he makes some pay on the back end. Extra point by Cairo Santos. He's good. And just like that on Thursday night, Chicago 7, Washington nothing. The ability is just trying to get him to fit into this scheme and the scheme to fit into his skill set. That's why you get excited about the potential of what he can do. All right. Our first look right now is Sam Howell. Played his college ball at North Carolina. Picked in the fifth round. They liked him as a sophomore. I mean, Ron Rivera telling us about, you know, how good he looked. goes out after his junior year you know mentioned not often do you find a franchise quarterback in the fifth sometimes you do find them in the sixth round out of Michigan though start from the 25 out of the gun on the ground following ahead nice run there Brian Robinson they're leading ground being They're picking up six. It'll be second down and four. How is an interesting story. You know, those first two years at North Carolina in that system, he flourished and took off. He had a lot of talent around him, a lot of NFL talent around him. They all left after his second year. So his third year, he was breaking in a lot of new people around him. And his production dipped down, and that's why I think he slid down. But this guy has a ton of ability and plays with tremendous poise. 92 TDs in three years. This is the Tar Heels, and that should be a first down on a pass here to the tight end. Logan Thomas, see where they spot it. Going to spot it just a little bit short of the 35. That's a heck of a catch on a third down to get that first first down. You know Sanborn's going to blow you up. That ball was going down. The spiral was going down, and it's 6-6. Logan Thomas has to get down there like he's fielding a ground ball to make that catch. Heck of an effort. With a split finger. Gibson. The back, the pass caught. We've got something going here. And maybe a little short of the first down. Dotson made the grab at the end of regulation. That's with Smith again in on the tackle. Nice game there. Going to spot the ball a little shorter. First down, second and one. And again, here they are with quicker decisions. And he's an athletic guy. They like to get him on the edge, too. I thought Dotson, good job of staying in bounds. came so close there to stepping out of bounds, but nice, quick, easy read. Ball is out. Get the ball to these receivers against these young corners. Powell for his first four. Second and one. And they pick up another first down on a two-yard game here by Robinson. They're working for every yard in the trenches. just like you said it goes to show you just never know from one week to the next this Bears defensive front for the most part has gotten pushed around in the interior with Justin Jones and Andrew Billings this year but not the story tonight this is a motivated defense that is flying around the defense that's allowed 29 points per game over the last two years worse than the league. To the outside again, they go. Short game here, Terry McLaurin gets into the action, making his first grab of the night. And what the Bears are doing with those young corners, they're playing a lot of softer coverage, so you're going to have to take those easy throws. You're going to have to rely on receivers making plays after the catch. So you'll take four yards, you'll take six yards. Eventually, you either set up double moves, or you set up an opportunity where you're going to have to go downfield and win one-on-one. That's Lucas Patrick, the center. So he's going to go for some attention. They may move Cody Whitehair, who's played a lot of center in his career, to that spot. Play action here. Howl fires caught. Another first down. And a nice run there by Thomas. Picking up about three or four more yards after contact. Stroman making the tackle. First down. This is what Matt Eberfluss is known for, this Tampa 2 look, meaning two high safeties, the backer's going to get deep. And when you get deep, you're taking away those shots downfield. And one thing you heard this week from Sam Howell on our call, hey, what's the key to going up against this style of defense? Well, they're going to play soft. We know that. I just got to take what they give me. I got to be patient. Take those underneath throws. And Eberfluss calling the defensive signals. first down at the 39 yard line now good protection he's going to go to the end zone incomplete Deami Brown was there as former North Carolina mate a little too tall a little too far second down now this is what they're waiting for safety here safety down opens up the middle finally a chance to be able to take a Shot downfield, and they've got it. And when you have it, you've got to connect. Ball is thrown well enough for De'Ami Brown, who's a college teammate of Sam Howell. They've got great chemistry. He puts it right in that scene, just unable to bring it down. Howell's first in completion. Robinson started one way, goes the other, and that doesn't fool Andrew Billings having a nice night. Third and nine. Brown has the speed to be able to hit those seams, but just over the fingertips there. He's thinking, man, we had it. Got to hit it. Third and nine. Let's come in pressure how back pedals how going deep into traffic and it's incomplete Dasha almost was able to make the grab we got a flag down though There's a flag on the far side of the field at the 36-yard line which is three yards beyond scrimmage So that's dominique robinson a little bit of a killer there in the sense That was a third and nine. It's going to make a third down in full from the 17. Herbert again behind Blassingame. To the outside he goes. Every run's a tough run for him. A little Herbert. Third year out of Virginia Tech. A sixth round pick in 21. You know, he's averaging almost nine yards a carry tonight. And if the Bears get this going with the way they like their structure, their offense with fields as a threat of play action and him being able to run on the outside, it's a game changer. I mean, it's what Luke Getze. I mean, anybody wants to run game, right? But especially this system and their quarterback. Well, they let David Montgomery out the door. He's not in Detroit. Saw him last week. And Herbert's now the man. Go five wide here. Fields hanging in, rolling away. Fields looking for the first step, gets it, and slides to a stop inside the five. The official for the moment looked like he was going to reach for the flag, but did not. That's Derek Forrest right there. Out two no-nos. Lose the edge, man-to-man coverage on the back end against an athletic quarterback. If you lose the edge with Chase Young, there's no one left there to account for the most dangerous weapon the Bears have, and that's Justin Fields. I think the officials of Forrest is trying to get out of the way, if nothing else, first down and goal. Ready to go. Fields again, over the middle, caught, commit, touchdown. Cole commit. Third in two weeks, and the Commander's fans are going, what is going on? I think they were, they are frustrated. And I think the Bears came into this game pretty confident that they could attack the backers in coverage. And here's the big tight end right here going up against the middle linebacker, Cody Barton. It's a mismatch. I mean, he gets separation. Even if he doesn't get separation, it's an advantage at 6'6". But he shows you, he can, he flex him out. He is a threat out there on the perimeter. Santos, extra point. And if you're just tuning in, that is not a typo. 27-3, Bears. Obviously, anti-social media as well, as usual. And there's even some stories out today about will he get fired after the game with, you know, 10 days from the next game. Well, there's a lot of release of emotion right now. Yeah, I mean, it's almost been a year since they won a football game. They're up 27-3. Of course, they had a big lead at half. That'll be his, I'm sure, his speech at halftime. They were up big on Denver and ended up losing. But it just looks like a team that's kind of ticked off and tired of it. You know what I mean? And they're playing with a lot of emotion tonight. I'll tell you, the seat doesn't get any hotter than what he and Justin Fields are dealing with in Chicago, having lost 14 straight. And they're trying to put in, you know, staying positive, and they're trying to get through the storm, saying the right thing. but you know it's eating them up and this first half has been great for them no doubt the numbers are astonishing 307 yards for Chicago 49 for Washington that is a 6 to 1 ratio and he has to throw that away and that bare defense which has obviously had a meltdown in the second half and this is a team that gives up as I mentioned 29 points per game worse than the league over the last two years allowing 49 yards on 18 plays. It's unbelievable. The biggest Bears fan couldn't have expected this. I mean, this defense has not been able to win the line of scrimmage all year. They've not been able to apply pressure. You just saw Javon Depster come in, 99, as a rookie. He gets pressure. Stroman had that interception. He started his career here. And that pass is caught, but nothing really happening after that. Even that time, rushing forward to Marcus Walker. He gets home. And affects the quarterback. It's almost like they're putting it all into this first half. Shows you the potential of what this defense can do, despite being down. Eddie Jackson, Jalen Johnson, Kyler Gordon. You're missing three guys in the back end, but they have shown up with something to prove tonight. We caught here Antonio Gibson gets the first down Meanwhile They're going to take a timeout Even the crowd doesn't like the timeout They're going, really? Going to go 64 yards here in three seconds? Who knows? Maybe he got a pass interference penalty. Sitting up deep. Who knows? Ron Rivera hasn't had 200 games like this in his career. This is a skunking to this point. 14th first downs to four. Eva Flew says get all the way back. Yeah, all the way back. All the way. 40, 50 yards back. Get back over there in Bethesda. Final play of the half barring a defensive foul. Well. That'll pick up some meaningless yardage. And the crowd says it all. 27-3. Down to you, Kaylee. 8-7 on Denver. Ended up losing the game. Right. 31-28. All right, we start with a touchback here. Washington at the 25-yard line, but first to Kaylee. Coach, how do you contain the Bears offense? Well, we've got 30 minutes. We're going to find out. We've got to find out on the field. It's got to be the guys that go out and step up and play some football. What did you say to try to rally your guys during the half? I let them talk to each other. Okay? Well, guys that got to do it, the guys that go out on the field. So they talked about it. And what did they say? They talked about doing it for each other, more so than anything else. Thank you, Coach. Direct. Yeah, for sure. I'll let them do the talking. For the 25. Pass. Robinson makes the grab. Robinson is able to slide away. From contact and it's a good beginning for Washington to start the third quarter as he takes it to midfield Gained a 24 yards screens have hurt this defense all year long and the timing of this is pretty good by Sam how He looks left kind of look shows. He's gonna go to the man in motion Then comes back gets rid of it just in time and picks up some good blocks downfield I'm surprised they're not going a little faster with a little bit of tempo just because Sam Howell looked so good last week against Philly late in that game in that two-minute drill and he's playing with a little bit more urgency. Play action. Good protection. That's caught. Game of about six. Brian Robinson making the grab again. called a seven-yard pickup, second down and three for the Commanders. Now you go back to the beginning of this game, the plan that Ron Rivera and his staff came up with, with Eric Biennium, was being patient, knowing that the Bears were going to sit back without those three defensive backs or starters in the game. They thought they'd get a lot of zone. Just taking their time and being patient, much tougher to do, down 24 in the second half. That pass is caught for a first down and then shoved that a bounce. That's Logan Thomas. Shoved that by Stevenson to another first down for Washington. Right away, Eric Biennium attacking the softer coverage. You know, if you're going to get easy throws to pick up first downs, you take it. You know, this second half could come down to their ability to execute in the red zone. You're going to move the ball between the 20s. What are you going to do when you get down in the red zone and those windows get tighter? They got great length at linebacker with Tremaine Edmonds and DJ Edwards. The red zone's been far in territory for these guys to this point. From the 39 on first down. Getting out here to Gibson. And they picked up three first downs on the first four plays of the third quarter. Remember we talked about what Chicago's doing. They don't want to give up that easy score. They don't want to give up anything downfield. So they're just sinking in coverage. And Hal knows that. And Eric Binnemi talked to him about that at halftime. You get the ball out to an athlete like Gibson, who's a former receiver in college and has done it up at this level. Pick up, again, positive yards. I'm telling you, it's going to come down to that red zone. You're going to move the ball. Pick the 48 yards on the first four plays on this drive. From the 27 now. Blitz coming from the outside. Picked it up initially. Has time throws. Contact flag. Pass incomplete, but you have Stephenson covering McLaurin, who's been silent tonight. McLaurin, only one target. Oh, look out! Sacked. Big play. Stroman, who had the interception that led to a touchdown at the end of the first half and started his career with Washington. Huge sack. And now again, we just talked about how they're disguising, trying to fool him. Look at his safety right now. He doesn't look like he's going to cheat down and help out. See how they're hiding that blitz, and eventually late, this blitz comes right there. Safety comes over to take that zone area and completely, you know, see his head. He doesn't even look. They disguised it so well, he didn't even look to think that that was a threat to his left, to the blind side. Nine-yard sack, second and 19. Powell throws caught inside the 30 that into the 22 third and long Gain seven will be third and 12. Four and a half to go in the third. Matt Eberflus, who has taken over, not just obviously his head coaching duty, he's taken over as a defensive coordinator these last few weeks. He said he's able to manage throughout the week and still obviously deal with his day-to-day job as a head coach. But he's in there getting his defense prepared, going back to his roots. Rush four. Howell steps up. Runs into traffic. Gets away. And stays inbounds. And comes close to a first out. What a move. Avoiding tackles. Almost stepped out of bounds. and is going to set up a fourth down and two. But the athletic ability here. We've talked all night about Justin Fields being a threat and what he can do as a runner and a scrambler and the ability to create their booing because the field goal unit's coming out. But, I mean, this looks like he's done, right? He's sacked. A stunt. Offensive line doesn't pick it up. I almost think he was ready to give up on it, but he just keeps kind of fighting a pump fake right there. So a 32-yard attempt. Washington trying to make it a 13-point deficit. Slice kick is good. Brown wanted to go for it on the fourth. It would have been fourth and three. And with 317 to go in the third. 27-14. Athlete in Dick Butkus. It's really the measure of linebackers from the time he played in college and, of course, the brilliant career in Chicago. Everybody compared everybody to Dick Butchess. But a man with a great sense of humor. Turned into a pretty good news. He is a really thin running back right now. Take it to him. Fields. A three and a half. Kendall Fuller making the tackle with three minutes to go in the third. Zone read there. Again, just trying to get him on the edge. I think the challenge for Luke Getze is to continue to be aggressive. I mean, you and I at the breaks, we were marveling. After every possession the Bears had at the beginning of this game, it's like, wow, these guys came out swinging with the play calling and taking shots downfield. And, you know, with this 13-point lead, it's a long way to go. You don't want to be too predictable and conservative as a play caller. Now you've got D.J. Moore in the backfield when they send him in motion. Look out again. But there is Fields with that great athleticism, reaching up, one-handing it, the former baseball player, and turning what would have been a mini disaster into a first down. Yeah, again, that baseball background coming in. And remember, the starting center, Pat Lucas-Patrick, is out. Whitehair, who has played center a lot back in. You wonder how much he's been able to practice to snap. but a tremendous play there. That ball is close to going over his head, and if he's able to recover it, it's probably a loss of 15 or 20 yards. Instead, first down, Bears. Look at the passing yards in the half. None for Chicago. 126 for the Commanders. Here we go. Here we go. Herbert takes the toss. Nope. Nothing doing in the way he's shaking his head. Yeah, he's going to go to the bench. You could tell. Yeah, you really respect him to try to tough it out, as Kaylee mentioned, with some of the other injuries to Homer and Johnson, using Blassingame now possibly to come back out. You know, that play from Justin Fields, it's one of those plays you don't want to forget about. You know, that ball is easily snapped over his head. Number one, he saves it, and then to get positive yards and get a first down. That's what he brings to the position. Something not to overlook and forget. Second and ten, so you've got yard line. So third down and short now. Stevenson covering on the play. With Ron Rivera, you know, he wanted to find a quarterback that could just be a distributor, a guy that processes quickly and can get the ball out to the wealth of talent that they have on the perimeter in the backfield, and they feel that Powell can be that guy. Good receivers. Harry McLaurin's terrific. John Dotson, Curtis Samuel, Thomas can catch as he did on the last play. And he's stuffed in the backfield. So on third and short, Andrew Billings, number 97, envelops Robinson. And it's fourth down. Nick Gates, the center, just gets dominated here by Billings and his quickness. Watch here. He works to the left and just loses his balance. and I tell you what, Billings does flash on film. He's an undersized guy, 311 pounds, so he's got a great lower body strength to be able to show what kind of quickness he has, but he shot that gap there. That was a heck of a play. Fourth and two. Trestway comes in. Trent Taylor standing back in the zone 20 for Chicago. Taylor backs up Fields at the 15 Runs it back about 11 yards It paid off Come up for the second drive here From the 26 yard line Fields is going to keep it Has blocking as well And takes it about 7 yards That's what they want to do Is get him on the edge This first drive Just tuning in Al mentioned it An aggressive mindset Number one, they take the ball after winning the toss. Number two, they put the ball in the hands of Justin Fields. Good protection, most importantly. Gave him room to work. And Justin Fields, the quarterback, like most of them out there, when they feel comfortable with what's in front of them, able to focus downfield and make great throws like that. It could not have been a better way to start this game than what they did, that opening drive for Justin and the Bears. After a seven-yard gain, second down and three. fired, caught, first down making the grab at the 40 yard line Robert Tunyon, long time Green Bay Packer, came over as a free agent in the offseason The other thing you see, and I think it's a carryover from last week, you've got to give Luke Getze a lot of credit, the ball's getting out fast, much faster than it was earlier in this year, and it just tells you that they're building this scheme around Justin Fields where he's comfortable when a quarterback's comfortable and he has answers You can see it in the way his eyes are working and how quickly the ball gets out. And that's kind of that mode he's playing in right now. Play action. Lions does his job again. A catch, though, is not made by Darnell Mooney. Out of his range, second down and ten. We go to Kaylee. Al, nobody on this Bears team is hiding from this losing streak. Justin Fields understands the reality of it all. Darnell Mooney told me, with each loss, it seems like Fields gets even more locked in and intense, determined to turn this around. He said you can see it on the quarterback's face and how he communicates. And Mooney said no matter whether you have a good or a bad day of practice, Fields is also the guy always cheering the guys on. Yeah, kept a positive attitude. Much easier said than done. Ain't easy. Pass to the outside. Nice move to the inside. And then D.J. Moore, a little short of the first down. He came over. Remember, Chicago was the number one pick in the draft. Traded it to Carolina. They wanted to get Bryce Young, and they did. And this guy also went in as part of the trade. And Carolina didn't want to, you know, get rid of him, obviously. But to make the deal, they had to get him. Yeah, and now he's so versatile. Meanwhile, third and one, and they're going to try to run the tush-push here. As they got to the line in a hurry. and where are they going to mark this thing? First down. Yeah, he kept driving his legs, but the great thing about D.J. Moore it gives him a legit number one receiver. That's why they went out and got him, and this is Justin Fields using his power. People forget he's 6'3", about 230 pounds, so he is a powerful quarterback, and keep an eye on him. He's still in the middle of this. Watch him. He doesn't go down. Watch him continue. He keeps moving, guys. He's not done. See him there at the top. Continue the leg drive. It's like a Jalen Hurts style. of quarterback sneak there. As we mentioned, I'm sure the competition committee and the meetings next year are going to look at that play. I mean, it's the ugliest play in football. Yeah, it is. It's effective. It's effective, but to finish on Moore he can catch those quick throws yards after the catch, but they're going to want to take shots downfield. One catch coming in three yards, going to call it against Chicago. Well, it's a great matchup. The reason McLaren's had a quiet night is, again, going back to the plan. You've got a rookie corner. He's not crazy. You're going up. It's a really talented receiver. You're giving him space. That out and up doesn't fool him. He's going to give up anything except something downfield, but he ends up getting caught with hands. Number 78 of the offense is reporting his own. Put the ball down inside his two-yard line. 25-yard penalty. on a pass that might not have been factual to begin with doing that far out of bounds Logan Thomas lined up in the backfield now he goes out on the wing to the right Robinson is the back take to him how on the run how close to the end zone it's caught Thomas touchdown Washington and they must have had a pretty good talking to each other in that locker room. That's the way you want to start the second half. Actually, Elijah Hicks plays this pretty well off the ball. They're going to go for two. 27-9 for what it's worth. It would make it a two possession lead if they get it to make it 27-11. They're going for the deuce here. See, Hicks initially had him covered off the line. He was almost expecting that play action pass, but then just got his eyes on a quarterback and lost a big tight end there in coverage. And that secondary minus Eddie Jackson, who would be their top guy, going for a pair here. All again rolling, looking, going to keep it himself and get in there. Two-point conversion is good. So the crowd comes to life. The commanders come to life. That took three minutes to go 75 yards, five plays to make it 27 to 11. Let's play for each other. Perfect. One more touchback. What a first down for Justin Fields and the ability to get the ball out of his hands quicker than we've seen this year. 3.2 is a little bit long, but he had time to make the read because of the offensive line here. Much quicker with the pressure on his face. Able to make another great throw downfield. Here even faster, 2.1 for the touchdown to the big tight end, Komet. So he has been in that zone. He's felt good. Every single possession points up on the board for the Bears. Near perfect first half offensively and defensively as well. There you go. Second half. Fields. Coming back the other way. And turns it into about a three-yard game. A lot of excitement there. And, again, we thought we'd see more of this. Him trying to get to the edge. They didn't really hide this at all. He just got a lead blocker with Herbert. But good job by the corner and the safety beating him to the spot. Instead of him just giving up on the play because of his athletic ability, He tries to keep that play alive, but that's the way you want to start if you're the commander's defense containing fields and keeping him short of picking up some big yards. Once he went down, it was spotted after only a one-yard pickup. Second and nine. With a fake toss, keeps it himself. There he goes for a first down. Shoved out of bounds at the 40-yard line behind it. Darnell right block, the right tackle. him. Rookie out of Tennessee was their first round pick. It's a really good follow up there by Luke Getze, right? The defense is worried about the perimeter. They're worried about everything going outside because it's success in the first half. Instead, he fakes it and encounters back the other way. He got some great blocks by that offensive line. You're right. Darnell Wright, the rookie right tackle, and Cole Komet led the way that time for the first down. What a threat as a runner, Justin Fields. Nine carries It's the 942 yards. Tipped and incomplete. Montez Sweat got a hand on it. Derron Payne forced that issue on the rush, second and ten. What a matchup here against Nate Davis. This is a tough matchup to the inside. Sweat's going to end up getting his hand on the football, but the reason he's able to make that play is what you see right there. is the big fella, Deron Payne. Look at him shed Davis and then pick up momentum. Feels very fortunate to even get that ball out. The quarterback and how he gets touched and here he's a ball carrier, but man, that was a just a pile drive into the ground. And normally you've got to finesse him down. Second and 15. Here they come again. Off his back foot field throws incomplete. Pressure on that time. Blasting game was the guy in the neighborhood. Cody Barton that time was the first guy in. Third and 15 and you've got a flag down. Scott Novak sidling over to his contemporaries. There is no foul for an illegal shift. Please set the play clock for 40 seconds. 40 on the play clock. Okay. They may not talk to the players, but they talk to each other about adjustments as a defense. and because that front four wasn't winning, they have dialed up. You see the backers right there. It's Barton who gets in there. They actually brought both the backers on that play. It's a third down and 15. There is a quintessential false start. Larry Borum, you saw Chase Young coming across the line. White hair moved to center. Carter now is in at left guard. They've had a few different combinations they've been working with. And this is the first time the crowd has been a factor to affect their communication up front. That was actually to Tyree. Carter moving over along that line where they keep shuffling and juggling with all of the injuries. He was called third down and 20. Fields. Throwing. Throws that one away. Again, the pressure that time took care of it. And they force a quick punt. Yeah, Whitehair moves to center. Carter is now at guard. And you still have a backup left tackle on Larry Borum, who's in no man's land against Chase Young. We mentioned Chase Young looks healthier and looks back to his true form. outside move then gets underneath with that length and speed and that really blew the play up. So again, these commanders playing the way we expected them to play all game long but it took them a half to get warmed up and to bring that pressure. So they survive the turnover and the punt here trying to get his team to not just, hey we're playing great for a half, we want to play 60 minutes want to learn how to win football games. He knows all too well. Now a throws. That's caught. Slipping a tackle. Turning it into about a six-yard pickup. Brian Robinson. Kaylee, what do you know? Guys, we don't have official word yet on Bears running back Khalil Herbert, but he has been running up and down the sidelines behind the Bears bench, testing the range of motion of that right ankle that you saw bend back so uncomfortably. But that running back group tonight, guys, they have had a tough go. Travis Homer, he is now questionable with a hamstring. Roshon Johnson, that rookie is out because of the concussion. And Deontay Foreman, he's inactive. So they've had to turn to that fullback. Kari Blackingame to get somebody on the field in their place. But Khalil Orbert looks like he's doing everything to go again. We'll see what happens when they're on offense. Meanwhile, that pass is held in by Gibson. Stays inbounds, takes it to the 35-yard line. Down the sideline goes Gibson over Prisker. That's a gain of 41. and now that's the beauty of his versatility he's a running back really flash receiver and he's matched up one-on-one against Brisker who's a safety so this is a favorable matchup it's not just a running back Gibson knows how to run routes he knows how to track the football and a good job here by Sam Howe locating that matchup no safety support gets the ball out at 2.7 seconds yeah Gibson was the number one running back for two years now he finds himself as a backup, but at Memphis he did everything. From the 40-35 yard line, that pass is caught. They're taking it to the 20. Dotson. John Dotson. Number one pick out of Penn State last season. Now you'll love this. Eyes just on Brisker. Comes down, quickly knows he's got that glance route, and he makes the decision off of Brisker coming down. He would have worked to the outside if he stayed back. Instead, he saw him slide down after the snap. They're trying to fool him, being as young as he is, but he recognized it quickly and got the ball out in a hurry. At the 21. Chance here with this offense, and he's very optimistic about what they can do this year. We hear from Scott Novak, our referee, for the first time tonight. All-start offense number three. That's a five-yard penalty. Second out. Byron Pringle batting himself on the helmet. And if you look around the quarterback position, we talked earlier about McLaurin and Curtis Samuel and Dotson, who they picked up, the Ami Brown, the backfield, Brian Robinson, Antonio Gibson. There's a lot of skill to work with. The big thing is can Sam Howell deliver and be able to be the guy? Robinson. The defense does its job again. Stopped. Short game right there. Yonkin Goughley, Demarcus Walker are both there. It'll be third and 11. This is a defense that has struggled. You know, this is a group that has not done a great job of getting off the field. They're dead last in third down defense. not done a good job of pressuring opposing quarterbacks. Dead last in the NFL, only two sacks. So right now, I don't know if they're feeling it because of the way their own offense is playing, but they're aggressive themselves. Well, Alan Williams was the defensive coordinator. He had to resign. So Iberfush is now calling the defense. Third down and 11. Deep drop. Howell's going to take off and not go very far. Demarcus Walker is there again. so the Washington commanders three and out on their first two drives still do not have a first out of an out game 145 yards to 12 bring a blitz here and the safety instead of dropping he ends up coming down so they're trying to confuse this young quarterback which he thought they would do it's a smart thing to do pre-snap to post-snap giving him different looks especially on third down Dress way his second punt Trent Taylor Waiting for it Drifting Makes the grab, avoids the first man And then takes it back out to the 31-yard line 152 remaining in the opening quarter 10-0 Chicago A couple of changes Offensively, you've got Tevin Jenkins comes in. He's been hurt, and he's going to take over that left guard for Cody White here. Talking about Chase Claypool in our introduction tonight. Not here, of course, for the second straight game. And told to basically stay home. LaShawn Johnson is now in the backfield. Play action. Pass caught. Moore. Great spin move to the inside. Off he goes again. What a first half for him. and finally after he breaks the tackle of the rookie Forbes, another long gainer. And another first and ten pass, play action pass for the Bears and Luke Getze. And it's a great job. You've got to beat the rookie one-on-one. One of the top receivers, nice little push off, gets away with it. Yards after the catch has got to be something the Bears can do tonight. And there's a great example of that by number two. On the ground. And you've got D.J. Moore on your fantasy league. He's already gone for 126 yards. Go to the caviar jar. That's not a bad start. He had a great game last week, too, when they went against Denver, where he ended up having over 100 yards receiving. So he's clearly their guy. I'll tell you, Luke Getze's got to feel really good about this plan right now, mixing up formations, personnel groupings, pre-snap movement, and has a quarterback to tend his own. Second and five. Another big hole. Another big game. It's Roshon Johnson, a rookie, picked in the fourth round out of Texas. How about that offensive line? You mentioned Jenkins coming in. He gets going here early, getting involved. He'll get up here. You'll see the left tackle able to climb up. Larry Borum opens up that hole, and I love Johnson. Just a downhill runner. puts his foot in the ground and builds up that momentum. And what a collision with Derek Forrest there. At Bears offensive line, missing two starters at the outset. Rookie right tackle dominating the line of scrimmage. Waning seconds of the quarter. Fields, look out. Gets it away, just flings it and flings it out of bounds. So Chase Young almost got him. Couldn't. And that's the way the first quarter ends. It's full. There is no foul. Second down. Of the first quarter where the commanders wanted. Intentionally grounding didn't get it. Meanwhile, second down and 10. Now a little flip here to Johnson to the 10. Terry, what did you see on that last play? Well, Al, he never got outside the pocket. So he's got to get the ball in the vicinity of a receiver. He's contacted before he starts his throwing motion, so it's all on him. He clearly throws it away from any receiver, well out of bounds. This should have been a foul for intentional grounding. Chase Young looking at his former teammate like, what the heck, man? What's going on here? Ron Rivera was heated while we were at break about it as well. Saved a few yards. Third down and six. Fields to the end zone. Reaching up. Does he make the catch again? D.J. Moore. Touchdown. He is having a career in one night. Beats Kendall Fuller again. That's 11 yards for the touchdown. He's already caught five for 137 and two scores. How about the throw by Justin Fields? A little slant and go. Perfect placement. Fuller never locates the football. and Moore so comfortable being able to get his feet down. Watch this route. Watch Fuller bite on it man-to-man. Ooh, little inside move, and the throw could not have been any better by Justin Fields. What were you saying about fantasy for D.J. Moore? Wow. What a night in the first 16 minutes of the game. 17 zip, and we will be back, we promise, in 30 seconds. We'll be right back. You know, if you're a Bears fan, if you're a half full guy, you go, wow. Right. Look at this. If you're a half empty guy, you go, we saw this last week. Right. Exactly. How about the start of this game with what the Bears have done offensively and what we've not seen at all from the commanders? You compare this total plays. Look at the yards, the first downs. Two, three and outs for the commanders. And that one-two punch fields to Moore. Washington still nary a first down. Begins this drive with a 25. It just feels like a game on a short week where one team so far has showed up with a chip on their shoulder, and they want to win a football game. And the commanders, they're a bit lethargic, off to a slow start. They've got to find a way to regroup here and fight back to get back into this game. Some people think, you know, 0-4, 14 straight losses. It's a mess through a dead dog coming to town. It's 17 to nothing. Hey, alert, alert, alert, alert. Alert, alert. Stay single. About 80, set. Toss here to the outside. Again, that defense does a great job. Robinson tackled that time by Terrell Smith, a rookie out of Minnesota. They picked him in the fifth round. Yeah, just to remind people that aren't familiar with it, The Bears are down three of their five defensive backs. You know, you include the nickelback, Kyle Gordon. Both are corners. You're cornering the safety, Eddie Jackson, the leader. So you've got Terrell Smith, who just made a great play, Tyreek Stephenson. You've got two rookies holding up a corner, not just in coverage, but also in run support right there. Russell Wilson able to shred them last week in the second half. Second down and eight. To the outside. caught and making the tackle. Two yards shy. Curtis Samuel making the grab there. He got Stallman and Edmonds in on the tackle. They're going to spot the ball at the 33-yard line. Third and two. That time Sam Howell doing a better job making up his mind and getting the ball out. That's what Eric Bien-Ami really wants to see from him as he's working again. Just his sixth career start. Young guy, but just wants to see him be decisive. work through his progressions. That time, ball out quickly to Samuel. Antonio Gibson is in the backfield. Flair him out. Howell throwing. Catches. Made. Reaching down is Logan Thomas. Makes the grab. Barely stays in bounds. And is able to pick up their initial first out of the game. Remember in the open, you said, how do they win? We talked about they've got to quit self-destructing. It's not just penalties. It's the time of these penalties. They're off the field here. Now it's fourth and ten and fourth and nine. Now it's third and four, and you give Howe another chance. They're off the field and maybe not even in field goal range. We're not for the penalty. Third down and four. The all-out blitz going in the last one. What do they do here? Coming again. A flag is thrown. and for the moment drop almost picked off but it's dropped tipped by Edmonds you saw the flag come in at the snap legal shift on the offense two players were moving at the same time so that makes it fourth and four and slide is going to come in for a long field goal attempt killing slide 50 you're out of Virginia Tech 51 yard attempt No wind to speak of, Tresway to put it down. And Sly's kick is perfect. Eight and a half to go in. To a great start reading recognizing opportunities seeing safeties out of position which we seen a lot of here in this first half You can see his eyes just locked in on his reads and of course he has the arm strength to make those throws So this first half could not have started any better. Of course, last week, saw much of the same in the Denver game. And they are focused on playing for 60 minutes. Here's the start last week. Yeah, last week he completed his first 16-17. I think it was a long Hail Mary at the end of the half that felt incomplete. Tonight, 9 of 13, 156, and of course his main man has been Moore, who has caught a total of five passes on five targets for 137. Joey Sly after including that 51-yard field goal with a touchback here. And we go to Kaylee. Al, the Bears center, Lucas Patrick. He has left the field to be evaluated for a concussion. So now, Cody White here is going to slide over to center. He started every game this year at left guard, but he does have 60 career starts at center. I saw him taking a couple of practice snaps with Justin Fields. He added tape to all five fingers on his right hand, and now he'll get a chance to fly over and see how the slow line can make it work with Alpatrick. Yeah, he's back once he began his career. Got a Kansas State as a second-round pick. Fields lining up in the gun here. He'll keep it. It's a block there from Blassingame. Run out by Curl after a gain of six. That's the beautiful thing when this offense is going the way it is with a lot of first and ten passing. You've seen the run game tonight with Herbert. They get back to their bread and butter, which is getting Justin Fields out on the edge. I mean, look at the yardage you pick up on first and ten. It's almost like Washington gets lulled to sleep, worried about other aspects of the offense, and it frees him up to pick up some positive yards there. Second and three. Fakes to give. Fires over the middle, making the grab there, and getting into Washington territory is Cole Komet. The 6'6", 260-pounder. Two TDs last week. Big gain here, 24 yards. Good job at D.J. Moore kind of clearing things out, and here's the big man right here. just kind of sits in the open space. Linebackers have to respect the play action. They sink in. Fields gets pressured late, but what a target. What a luxury to throw to commit. It's 6-6 in the middle of that defense. He is a big-time target. Now, Justin Fields, like his security blanket. From the 45. Herbert behind blocking. It's about three. Payne making the stop down to seven minutes to go in the half. 14-point Chicago lead. Al, you'll love this. Even when it's not working, it works somewhat. It's been that kind of night. Watch the left guard Jenkins pull around. I mean, they've been opening up holes here. But watch him. He still stumbles out of the gate. They still get today to him as well. Fields. Get him out of the pocket. Throws. grabbed by Tunyon. Out of bounds right there in the effort. About a two-yard game. That time, Chase Young chasing Fields. This is a game within the game of the ends. Chase Young on one side, Montez Sweat on the other. They're going to line up wide, and their whole goal is we've got to keep Justin Fields in the pocket. Nobody knows that better than Chase Young, who was a teammate with Justin Fields in 2019 at Ohio State, and good friend. And so he, of course, is going to try to do the best he can to harass his good friend. Yeah, Young trying to stay healthy has been a problem the last couple of years. Meanwhile, big hole, exploited on the right side. Herbert inside the 15-yard line. Cody Barton saved a touchdown. Wright and Davis, the right guard and a right tackle, providing a huge hole. The motion really affects this defense, and they bust the gap control. Good job by this offensive line, not just in protection, but a good job of climbing up to that second level, and they're protecting the edges because of the threat to the quarterback, and it opens up the middle. Gain of 34. Fields just fires that one away. Being chased there, second down and 10. Took under six minutes to go in the opening first quarter, which has been all Chicago. It's a short week every week on Thursday night, but in this short week, Ron Rivera knows his defense with Jack Del Rio. They've got to stop the threat of fields running. Anybody who defends Chicago, the first thing they talk about is, we've got to take care of the edges. We can't let him run the football. Let's make Herbert, let's make the backs have to run, and Chicago knows that. They put together a nice plan there to try to take advantage of those edges being protected. Play action. caught Cole Komet loses the ball the man has scored two touchdowns last week hit by Deron Payne and a scramble to find out who's at the bottom of that pile Deron Deron Payne retracing and he brought that right club to try to get that football away from the big tight end Komet is 6-6-2-60 look at this club Bang! Knocks that ball loose. It's on the ground. And Komet, very fortunate, it just ends up right underneath him, and he's able to secure it. How about that retrace by the big fella? Knocks that ball loose. Right under the right hamstring. Collects it. Keeps possession. Third and nine. They go five wide here. Cash is caught and trying to get that first down backing toward the line to game, but a little short is Cole. Come at once again. So fourth down and one. The commanders do a good job of anticipating that route, keep the big tight end short of the first down. But if you're a Bears fan, first possession, you go down, put a touchdown on the board, and now you've got a shot at a field goal to go up 10-0. It's a team that was up big last week and couldn't hold on against Denver, and they're getting points here early, playing aggressively. Again, not that aggressively, otherwise you'd be going for it right here. 22-yard field goal attempt is good. So they gain 100. Boy, it is. It's been a lot of different quarterback chances and opportunities. Santos will send that one through the end zone. and down 10 to nothing Washington will start from the 25 yard line look at those names Mark Griffin of course had a good run Kirk Cousins was here and got things going but see after 57 games he's now in Minnesota well over a decade ago there's Robert Griffin at the bottom at one point man he looked like he was the guy that was the answer and he got hurt and Mike Shanahan was here and here's Eric the enemy a great story in and of himself comes over here as the offensive coordinator from the 25 yard line Howell serving, looking decides to take off You know with Biennemi, I mean obviously he's been interviewed for head coaching jobs all over the place, I don't know how many times now, but he was always under the shadow of Andy Reid and the knock was, wait a second Andy is the offense, Andy calls the plays so Eric decides, hey man, I gotta get out of that shadow and Ron Rivera hires him. Yeah, I think any time you want to have an opportunity to become a head coach and you're an offensive-minded guy and you're working for an offensive head coach, you do have to go out and do your own thing. This is a huge three minutes to go to the half. And this will be upcoming on this drive. The 12th play. Bears are on 33 plays and commanders are 16. Third and four. Five out of seven on third down. Fields. To the end zone. Action is there. It is Darnell Mooney. This contact made. It'll be fourth down. and no longer you've got St. Juice covering on the play. Well, Mooney tries to use the big tight end, Komet, to his outside, uses him as a screen, just tries to run behind him to affect the coverage, and it does. It does his job, but the ball's thrown a little bit late, and it allows St. Juice to be able to catch up to him and affect that throw. Terry's shaking his head. Terry, what are you shaking your head for? It sure looked like it was early contact not playing the ball to me. Sure did. 36-yard attempt here by Cairo Santos is good. I've been coming here for 38 years doing the NFL. And over the last 24, especially over the last 15, this was not a happy fan base. But they are thrilled. Dan Snyder was here for 24 years. That's an early success. but not much over the course of a quarter century. And, boy, they were just looking for anybody to come in. All that cost them was six billion clams. Exactly. But, you know, what was cool was just to hear from the players, too, and the coaches. There's a real appreciation for the energy that he's brought in. And they said anything that they – he's like, well, how can I help? What do you need? Ron Rivera's communicated with him pretty openly. So, you're right. Right. Different energy. Howell throws is going to be picked off. Greg Stroman intercepting it on the pass right over the middle. And the defense goes down to celebrate. As Howell throws the pick here. And Chicago's back in business again. Here's the matchup right here. But what I want you to watch is Howell works from his left back to his right. And by then he's late. This is, again, the area that he's trying to work and understand is the timing of his progressions. And as a young guy, it just takes time. It's examples like this of learning through this. Heck of a play, by the way, by the backup nickel. Greg Stroman, who's been out most of his career with a lot of injuries. I think he had like 73 snaps in the last four years until the injury this year to Kyle Gordon has given him a chance to step up. So he's been injured. He's been on practice squads, Washington, Buffalo, the Rams, Chicago now, and takes advantage of his opportunity with Gordon down. Makes a heck of a play. From the 36-yard line. Has that knocked down. That time is good. Chase Young knocking it down with 2.15. Second down and 10. Bears have two timeouts if they need them, plus a two-minute warning. I had a chance to see Chase on the field before the game, just asking him how he's feeling. You know, the last few weeks, it looks like he's gradually getting back to 100% coming off the ACL from a couple years ago. And he said, watch tonight. He's like, this is the first time I really feel good. And if you've watched him, I know it's not a great night so far for the commanders, but 99 is moving around the way you expect him to. 55, 54. Ready, go. Herbert. Takes a bunch to bring him down. Third down, seven. As we approach the two-minute warning. Two timeouts remaining. It'll be third down and seven for Chicago. We come back 20-3 Bears. Farm half-time show coming up in a couple of minutes plus. From the 33-yard line on third down and seven. Herbert fights his way inside the 25. Look at this. Cody Whitehair leading the way. So Moore's having a fabulous night. Meanwhile, here's Herbert. Eight carries, 72 yards. That's nine yards a carry. Watch Whitehair and also the right guard, Nate Davis. Both of them able to climb up to that second level. No interior defensive lineman made it very easy for that interior to be able to get up and impact again those linebackers. There's just no one there. Positive yards. When the guard doesn't even pull around to pick up the linebacker. 72 rushing yards 10 carries at 7 yards per 2 second and 7 big toss fields buys time feels throwing that one incomplete yet Mooney and commit both in the neighborhood pain that's unconverged with Allen 37 much better job not just by the front but on the back end for this Ron Rivera Jack Del Rio defense They not falling for the misdirection. Justin Fields always a threat. A little fake there to Leo Herbert on the pitch. And then came back the other way with the discipline and sound. This is sound defense there by Washington. Herbert. Enough for the first down as they give it to him inside. Draw. Nate Davis helping to lead the way. First down. And going no huddle here. Fourth and inches is what they're going to call it now. And again, does he make it? They say nothing yet. First down now. Man, look at the first down on the third down. They run up to the line of scrimmage, spotted it a little short. Again, everybody's going to this, especially when you have a quarterback like Justin Fields with the size that he has. How about that run to play before that third down with Hurt. Offensive line. Almost again, doesn't matter. There's been some guys rotating in. They're playing with some backups. Boy, they are climbing up to that second level to get into the face of those linebackers. Fields to the outside. Nothing happening there. St. Brent Aquinemius. St. Brown, first target of the night, second down, and 10. Getze is doing, again, a very good job of mixing up the looks and creating some frustration for Washington's defense, keeping the tight ends from time to time in to help out. That time they did keep an extra tight end with Mercedes Lewis off to the right there to affect the pass rush with Montez Sweat. So anything they can do to just try to make it look different. Keep the same play calls, but the presentation very different in this first half. High snap. Collection. Again, Herbert. Tough running. Close to a first. Khalil Herbert. Six carries, 53 yards for him. And you touched on it. Watch the right hand of field. Just a heck of an athletic play. Again, he's a baseball player going back to his high school days. Comes in handy there. You see, Herbert had to hesitate. A lot of times that disrupts the timing, and the play gets blown up. What a play by Fields. Good job by Herbert waiting. And then there's that offensive line again, controlling things against one of the top fronts in the league. That's right here again. Meanwhile, here we go again on a third and one with the push. Yep, one more time. Rugby. It's like rugby Australian rules football. I don't know what it is. It's a mess. Oh, man, yeah. Comet and Herbert behind him. Herbert's 5'9", 2'12", but 6'6", 260. The quarterback's 230. Look at the black jersey just flying in there. There's nothing you can do. Nothing. Except change the rule next year. Right. Well, the way they've been going here, wouldn't be surprised. It looks like, see if Herbert motions back into the backfield. Right now, an empty look. but fields under pressure and nothing just has to keep it and eat it tackle the line of scrimmage by Sweat and Young this is what they like to do because of his run game but watch out to Chase Young the numbers are where they want it everybody's outside but look at Chase Young known as a pass rusher But a good job of anticipating when the defensive front sees empty they they're alerted Alert to Justin Fields is a threat to run It's up to them with the numbers cleared out of there against empty. They've got to make plays like that Go for wide here Fired caught 19 yard line commit will take it inside Third down A little over thought tonight has resulted in a touchback. See a night like this with Fields, and you see the potential of what he can be. That's why the Bears, I think, are excited about Luke Getze, this offense, having a night like this to show what I think they're capable of doing with DJ Moore coming over. Unbelievable night for Moore. Think about his time in Carolina. He had a whole bunch of different quarterbacks. When guys coming in and out, he had Baker Mayfield at one point who, you know, came and went. You know, the quarterbacks, they would have to have tags and said, Hi, my name is whatever. And DJ's on the other end of it. Revolving door. Yeah, right. Meanwhile, don't look how the Baker's found a home in Tampa Bay. Sure has. How about that? Three on one. We're going to get them at Buffalo in about four weeks or so. Well, he is playing with that blue-collar approach that he's played with when he's played well, especially going back to his college days at Oklahoma. Kind of play with a chip on his shoulder. That's what he looks like he's playing so far these first four weeks. Who can forget that Thursday night game last year? Oh, yeah. Signs with the Rams on a Tuesday, and Thursday night leads them down the field with a win over the Raiders. on the flight learning the playbook crazy Sean McVay schooling him quickly Lauren makes this catch So we get down to the final minute of the game and a happy ride home for Chicago You're gonna like this as a semi Bobby's you got ten days before you play another game And that's Caught by Crowder. Meanwhile, Chicago. They'll take on Minnesota next. Then the Raiders. Then at the Chargers. That's their next three. One at a time, right? That's what they said, right? One day at a time. That should take us to the final whistle. A little pushy shoving. That's going to do it. John Bates makes the catch. What a night for Fields. What a night for Moore. What a night for Matt Eberflus. There he is. Getting this team ready. Great job. Coming off the disaster last Sunday. Short week on the road. and man alive. First win in almost a year. All right. 40-20 our final. Hang up. Hang around now. Don't hang up. Hang around with the CC many football team show after these messages. Last in game is the running back. A fullback really by trade. That pass is caught. Moore is able to go down the sideline and turn it into a long game. They're going to rule him out. He goes toward the end zone, but he's going to be stopped. just outside the 30-yard line. We've stepped out. So they go to him. He makes a great move on the defender right there. That's Forbes, the rookie. Again, we saw that earlier. They wanted that matchup, that one-on-one matchup with D.J. Moore against the rookie. He had a tough outing last week against the Eagles. Pretty tight coverage, but the location of the football away from the defender, and now he rolls the dice, took a big gamble going for that football, and then Moore's down that right sideline. 32-yard game there, 174 receiving yards. Here goes Blassengame, who spent some time in Tennessee, blocking for Derrick Henry. He had no touches this season coming into this game. Start with a second down and seven for Chicago from the 32. And the handoff here goes to Blassengame. Third and five. I apologize. Something to watch here. Emmanuel Forbes, the rookie who continues to get matched up with D.J. Moore, had a rough game last week against Philly, and now has been benched. They've moved St. Juice to that spot. They're just trying to find the right matchups. Last week he gave up nine receptions, 197 yards, the combination of A.J. Brown and Devontae Smith, and a rough night tonight. So he's now on the sideline. St. Juicely, that big play at the end of last year's game, which cemented the win. This field throws a little too far for Moore. D.J. could not get there. Danny Johnson back there covering on the plays. Fourth down. They had moved St. Juicely to corner. Then they go to the nickel package. They moved St. Juicely to the nickel. Back to nickel. And instead of putting Forbes in, they got Danny Johnson. He's been on the bench most of the game. How about that introduction? Come on in. A little double move against one of the top receivers, one of the biggest nights a receiver could have. Come handle that double move. Cairo Santos now. This will be a 43-yard attempt. Trenton Gill to put it down. Through the uprights it goes. 30-14, and back we come in a half minute. Lunch? Yes, please. That'll be $23. Your ad says it's free.

Guaranteed. Get iPhone 15 Pro on us. We're back. We were talking about the new owner of the Commanders, Josh Harris, by on the team after Dan Snyder held him for almost a quarter of a century. So think about this. Josh Harris spent $6.1 billion for this franchise. There he is. when the Chicago Bears were formed, George Halas, the entry fee for the National Football League was $100. Of course you told him that. I had to tell him that, of course. Hey, brother, can you spare a dime? $100 to get into the league a century ago. He said when he sent that money, he said he had to take a deep breath. Oh, yeah. You're wiring six million. Oh, yeah. There's so much excitement for the future with him at the helm as a leader. Magic Johnson, a part of that leadership team. Magic got his hand in so many things these days. The Dodgers and, of course, the Lakers and theaters and a bunch of stuff. Good man. Real good man. from the 25-yard line. How can he get out of the backfield? Yes, he can. And turns what would have been about an 8-yard loss into a 5-yard gain. Instead of studying the Bears' defense this week, he must have been studying Justin Fields. I mean, he is showing you that he's got the ability, more physicality than anything, and balance. He knows exactly where he needs to go. Oh, that ball almost came out. Edmonds looks like he almost got his hand on it. But what a tremendous individual effort by Logan Thomas. And, again, just the awareness of knowing exactly where that marker was. So Smith has had a big night defensively. And they'll play on a short week next week at Arrowhead against them. All right, so here we go with a first and ten. after Smith comes off the field under his own power. Jalen Jones comes in on that spot. Howard, deep drop, long throw, deep downfield, and it's incomplete. The crowd wants a flag, and they get one. That's McLaurin. On a pass, a little underthrown, and Stevenson looks back and goes, Well, that's a rookie corner against a vet on an underthrown ball where he did not locate the football. any time you're out there on an island and you can't find the football and they're going to discuss this and make sure it's catchable. But McLaurin, the veteran, intentionally uses the body of Stevenson to try to work back. Terry, what are you seeing here? You know, they're running in phase, and the receiver is trying to make a play back for the ball. They're discussing whether that contact significantly hinders the receiver for coming back. No foul. So it looked like the official closest to it, interference. They discuss it. Pick it up. It's interesting, that aspect of working back to the football, because I don't see that. I mean, I think Stevenson looks lost and doesn't locate the football. So we can agree to disagree. I think that should be an interference call. Well, it's second down and 10 as it comes back. It would have been a huge pass, a huge play, and Rivera's still arguing his case to no avail. Second down and 10. And that was the break they needed, meaning the commanders. That's exactly what they were looking for. Howell hangs in. Throws on the run. Catch is made. Inside the 25 goes Terry McLaurin. Right on the money to McLaurin that time. Great ball. And he actually used. He's kind of stacked right here. He gets behind the big tight end, Thomas. And is able to work around and instantly gain that separation. off the line of scrimmage against that rookie corner. How about the location of this ball? The touch on that ball over Edmonds, perfectly into the arms there of McLaurin. And over Stephenson, gain a 32. Clock down to six minutes. Now dancing, throwing, but out of bounds. The dots in the intended receiver, who scored at the interregulation, descended to overtime on Sunday in Philadelphia. He is second down and 10. What did Stevenson get away with one there? Just not getting his hands on the receiver there at all. Nothing to reroute him or slow him down on his route. 29 seconds on the play clock. Stroman will come off. But the Bears catch a break. There's Smith, the rookie corner, who's now out. And, by the way, Jalen Jones, 31, is in. Stroman the nickel is now out yes so the depth already being tested with Jalen Johnson a starter and Eddie Jackson out and Kyle Gordon out this this Bears team on both sides of the ball just holding dear life with the injuries and Williams comes in number 30 they going deep into the bench to get somebody back there Pressure comes and it a one grab. Somehow, someway, Howell gets rid of it. But then a pass to the white church takes care of Robinson. That was Jalen Jones that time. He got free. He came in and forced the issue. How about despite all these subs coming in, Matt Eberflue's saying, we're not going to slow down. Now Edmonds is down. They're still dialing up this pressure. Let's see off to the right, the quarterback. There's the pressure right there. Mentioned Jalen Jones usually in there to cover. This time he's turned loose. They had to move him to nickel with Stroman out. Keep some of these plays alive, so instead of a loss, he gets the positive yards of five. Second and five. Extra pressure. Fires to the outside. Hold in. Flag down. McLaurin came back to make the grab. Get the call from Novak. While the quarterback was in the pocket, illegal contact on the defense number 49. That's going to lead to crime. First down. Take the 10-yard game. First and 10 at the 40. Edmonds, a big offseason move for the Bears to try to solidify the middle along with T.J. Edwards. Boy, does he bring great length. Known for his ability to cover at 6'5", 240. That time manned up there with Logan Thomas in the middle. They didn't decline it, but just getting a little bit too handsy there in coverage. Edmonds coming over from the Buffalo Bills. Four-man rush. Howell buys time. Throws into traffic. caught and picking up the first down Byron Pringle former Chief making his first catch it's a great job by Pringle working back to find that opening realizes his quarterback's in trouble he gets to the top of this route looks back and then works back to the inside just settles right there in the hole between those linebackers Edwards and Edmonds from the 50 late pressure comes His pass is incomplete. Crowd yearns for a flag. Gets none. Stevenson covering on the play. Intended for Pringle again. Time he got the ball out quickly. Just Pringle that time lost his footing at the top of the route. See the difference first half to second half. A lot of that has to do with the approach by the commanders. Getting the ball out a lot faster underneath. Better protection. Powell had completed 16 in a row. Until that incomplete pass. Again, straight drop back. Fires and traffic with the catch made flag thrown. This time it's Jamison Crowder. And you saw the flag come in. there is no foul for illegal contact on the play the result of the play is the first down now watch Sam Howe's eyes you can see the way he looks right and then comes back to his left watch him work through the progressions right then come back to the left usually laid over the middle isn't good but they continue to attack the linebackers in coverage there's his eyes good job of not giving up on it an area that he's really working on is working quicker through those progressions and being more decisive. Oh, no! Harry! Harry! He takes the screen and gets it away. That time it was Gervin Dexter, rookie out of Florida. Number 8's in the area. No offense in the ground. He just tells us that number 8 was in the area. That means that Brian Robinson was the intended receiver. You check it out. Dexter with good pressure, but what's great is right there, the experience of T.J. Edwards. He's known for his ability, his instincts against the run, but this time he feels this, sees it, anticipates it, and disrupts the timing with Howell trying to run that screen. Second and ten. going deep and reaching out. Can't make the catch. Diving for it, Logan Thomas. Stevenson and Brist are both back there on the play. Third down. The big tight end against the rookie corner gets his left arm to try to keep Thomas' left arm away from trying to secure the ball out and up. He bites on it. Just doesn't have the speed to pull the lay, but still has a chance laying out. Clean play by the defender. Ball's put exactly where it had to be. Just a tough catch for Thomas to come down. Third and ten. Caught. Can he get the first? Yes, he can. Needed ten. Brown picks up twelve. Well, if you're going to go underneath, you need receivers to make plays after the catch. That's what Brown does here. He's known with his vertical ability, ability to stretch a defense. Here's showing some toughness to pick up those yards for the first down. Get out to him, saying, come on, keep eating, keep doing your thing. You're talking about a guy, as you said, three lifetime carries. Yep. Thrown into this room. First time out. Injury update. Herbert, questionable ankle, homer. The other running back, questionable hamstring. Johnson concussion out. Foreman inactive. Right, Foreman's inactive. It's a blasting game in his three lifetime carries. Not only knowing the plays, but securing the football. Right. Because the commanders, they are swinging away, trying to knock that ball out. Yeah, Red Grange not active tonight. Neither is Nagurski. The passing of Buck is thinking about the great Bears of all time. Man, they've had a few. Third and two. Maybe one of the greatest, if not the greatest of all time. Here we go. Pass is called in by Moore. Gets free. Washington gambles and lose the gamble that time. 56 yards, touchdown. And Fuller trying to jump it. Moore able to make the catch. And then three to the end zone. And a 230-yard, three-touchdown night for number two. How about the play call? The aggressive approach by the Bears. A team that has lost 14 straight, third and short. shotgun instead of just taking it the easy way, running the quarterback or running glassing game. Soft coverage. You go to your man and he makes them pay for it. You just love to see if you're a Bears fan. Luke Getze and the Bears being aggressive in that situation. See the soft coverage off to the left. I think the commanders were probably expecting run and instead they get aggressive playing to win. Get the ball out to DJ Moore, what a risk by Fuller there trying to go for the football. Yep. That's hit or miss. There's that cushion. And Moore yards after the catch. Took a gambling and rolled a seven. Not on the come out roll either. Touchdown. Look how close that is. Wow. That's the night of nights for the former Panther. That's why they brought him over. But if they bring him over, they get all those draft picks. This may turn out to be one hell of a trade for the Bears. Man. And for Fields tonight, 282 yards, four touchdowns, no picks, no fumbles. You know, it's been the bugaboo with him. and a 17-point Chicago lead. Well, so 158-3 is the max. That's this season, not only tonight. That's this season. That's a pretty good rating. Rating, I mean, people go, what is that? But that's the highest you can get. Let's put it that way. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Just keep looking, number two. Keeps you wondering. If you're Justin Fields. Here, let's go Bears fan here. Yeah. And a sack. That's Walker. So the Bears, two sacks in four games. And tonight, four. And Walker is a guy that gives you versatility because he can play outside or he can play in here. And what a nice job there. Just sudden off the line of scrimmage and finishing. That's what they've been talking. They've been getting pressure, but finishing to get that sack. Second and 21. 23-yard line, Curtis Samuel makes that grab. He just cannot say enough about not just the fact that they're going to win this football game, but when you go back and look at the players that had to rotate into this game and the injuries that they've been dealing with. It's incredible. It's unbelievable. Another sack. This time it's Rasheem Green. Meanwhile, with five sacks tonight, Howell's now been sacked 29 times this season, most in the league. So it's fourth down, fourth and 19. under three to play. I mean, really kind of, you know, an astonishing night in many ways. You know, Chicago in the crosshairs. That's caught, but well short of the first down. Turned it over on downs. You know, when the press and everybody else starts calling you things like a dumpster fire, that's not good. Right. But you know what I really admire? The fact that they've stood right in the middle of that and taken it head on. All these injuries, no one's making excuses. All these things that have happened, they just say, hey, we're close. In fact, that's what he said he told his team. They lose that game. They're up 28-7. They lose to Denver. And he looked them in the eye after the game in the locker room. He said, guys, we're close. That was much better. You'd think he wouldn't say that, right, after a 21-point loss. But he's found a way to keep this team engaged. And despite all the losses and all the injuries, they're rewarded with a big win here on the road on a Thursday night. Pretty much running out the clock if they want. For the moment, Washington will take a timeout. I mean, you think about the Bears. They lose the game last week. You know, that's a gut-wrencher. You got a short week. Not only a short week, you got to travel. You know, you get two days at home. Get on the plane. Spend the night at the hotel. You know, on the road. Everybody's saying you stink. well that's why they play the game yeah see Chase Young and Justin Fields talking to each other out there, former teammates and I think you also learn as a team what you're capable of doing through that adversity You know, now you can look at each other and say, guys, we know what we can do. You know, we know. This is a team. You're talking about Washington stepped in the middle of the ring against Philly last week and gave them all they could handle. So this is a big game for the Bears to try to turn things around. And you're going to see more and more number two for the Bears. Obviously a big move by the Bears picking him up. They wanted him to become wide receiver one, and that's what he has become. One of the top receivers in this league. And doing it different ways. He's a threat downfield vertically. If you leave it one-on-one. He's a big-time threat, as we saw, underneath if you play him soft. Yards after the catch because of how strong he is. There he is. One, two, three. Special night for D.J. Moore. Patrick, second most yards. Receiving in the history of this storage franchise. Alshon Jeffrey at .249 a few years back. Ready, go, go. A little high snap, no problem. It's going to take us to the two-minute warning. D.J. Moore. D.J. Moore won a trip to the Pro Bowl in one night. Done. Yep, done. After the game, it's a J.C. Penney. Well, yeah, I think I'd give San Fran a slight edge. But again, nobody knows anything, you know, right? Of course not. Everybody knows. Nothing nobody knows. Establish. Great. Here's Cairo Santos. A 37-yard field goal attempt. And on a couple more. 40-20. The man. We talked about the Bears. There's Ryan Poles. That's to feel a lot better. You know, you look at the commanders tonight, they're thinking, and again, you're always saying, well, you don't want to look ahead, but tell me. Maybe they're thinking we've got Chicago here, we've got Atlanta next week, we've got the Giants. Some people are thinking 5-2. Yeah. Yeah, and I think maybe the commanders were thinking that. You know, I think they came into this game very confident that they'd be able to win, and then you start to look down the line a little bit at some of these games they have coming up, Atlanta, New York, and Philly back home. There's a lot to like about what they've shown at times. Yep. Right? Just being consistent. But tonight, not anything that they expected. Every kick. 30 Williams goes into the corner spot. And, again, the plan doesn't get more conservative with these subs. Iberflues of anything. Just sticking to the plan. He is coaching to win the game. he's not coaching not to lose. And again, we mentioned before, not only the head coach responsibilities, but calling the defensive plays in the absence of Alan Williams, who resigned after a couple of weeks this season. So he takes over the play. Meanwhile, he'd have been better, Sir Robinson, by dropping it because it's a loss of five. It's third and 15, and Edmonds comes off under his own power. Not to mention the clock. You know, if that's an incompletion, you know, it's a totally different set of circumstances. But of course you're just trying to make a play if you're Brian Robinson So Edmonds goes to the sideline and he'll be third down in 15 And they wind the clock Pressure again. Incomplete. Dimson started on the look up field again. That time they sent Jalen Jones in. So it's fourth down and a sly will come in. They're trying to make it a seven point game. Again, they're bringing that pressure. They have such a distance to make there on that third down. Even if he catches this ball and Gibson's frustrated, he's going to be tackled. They're still going to have to kick a field goal, even though you're thinking four down territory there. It's a 46-yard attempt here. Slides made them from 51 and 32. Two for two. And this one is no good. Wide to the right. Huge. Stays a two-possession lead. 30-20. After losing 14 straight, the Bears are thinking, come on, man, let us catch a break. Come on. One time, let us catch a break. Sam Howell who's worked hard to get this offense back in his game. One side the frustration, the other side the elation. He's teaching more than holy. How bad do these guys want to win and need to win? The emotions going back and forth in the second half. Here we go. Blasting game. Not bad for a guy with three lifetime carries coming into the game in his fifth year. And, again, Tennessee did a lot of blocking for Derrick Henry. He's bounced around. Drafted free agent with Minnesota. He mentioned it's Tennessee. Blocking for the king, Derrick Henry. And now really here just to block for the Bears. But with four running backs injured, he's showing some versatility. We've got another commander down, looks like John Ridgway. Yep. So that for the moment will stop the clock. But once they take care of this, the clock gets wound again, and Fields can start taking a lot of time or some time off the clock at this point. let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS big emphasis on getting the ball out faster for Justin Fields look at the numbers under four seconds 226 yards to three touchdowns I think that's as much about him having time to operate and again Luke Getze and he just continuing to go down this path of finding the right scheme and the best way to attack defenses and just the consistency. That's what they're searching for, I feel, with Justin Fields. Second and four. Line the clock. Under four and a half to go. Mooney goes in motion. Snap it at three. And trudging up the middle. Blasting game again. Third and short. How about that shot of Herbert? Caught inside the five. Curtis Samuel. Sets up a first down and goal. Just working the seams. All three on the trips, if you include the tight end on that left side. They're just trying to find that open man picking on the safety. Make him make a choice, inside or outside. He hesitated to the inside, and it opened up for Curtis Sammler to the outside. There's a little late getting an 11th man on the field. So Billings coming in. Too late. First and goal. Howell throws, and 10-difford Thomas and broken up. Second and goal, Elijah hits covering. good tight coverage here by Hicks who again is in for Eddie Jackson initially there's pretty good job here by Logan Thomas getting separation there's the blitz it gets picked up balls late and because it's a little late it allows the much quicker safety to catch up to the bigger tight end and knock that away play number 11 on this drive one run nine throws Howell throwing Knocked away That time intended for his old College mate Brown Smith breaking it up Third and goal Like this motion By Eric Biennemi Make the Bears have to communicate Those young corners here Smith See the blitz You see the communication Just a slight hesitation And because of that He had inside move there Ball's a little bit behind, but got to be able to make that catch for that touchdown. Third and goal. He got two plays to try to get it in. I'm thinking three here. Third and goal. Wide open. Touchdown, Curtis Samuel. And going for two to try to make it a one-possession game. Curtis Samuel got free. Glitz here puts the safety in a really tough spot. Hicks has been playing well, but seeing him hesitate on that outside receiver coming in, there's just no chance. It's one thing to stay up with Logan Thomas to tie it in. It's a whole other thing to try to stay up with Curtis Samuel. Yep, two kicks to the inside, got free on the outside. Can they make it a one-possession game with the two-point try? Oh. Can he run it in? He cannot. Gets rid of it at the last second. And hauled in there by Stevenson. But in the NFL. Came over in that deal with Carolina. So Chicago, I mean, if the season had ended today, and a lot of Bears fans before the game, they thought that was a pretty good thing to have happen. Yeah. Not right now, but Chicago would have the first two picks in the draft, Bears and Carolinas. Not that they're looking for that right now. They'd like to win a few games. every possession matters in a game like this and every play matters in a game watch gibson sneak out of the backfield again it's easy to look at this replay but this is the one that sam howe will look at and say he's even looking at him he makes that throw and i think that was his read he's looking at dj edwards dj edwards is out of position had gibson locked up man to man he gets that ball out. It's a one possession game and it's a different completely different approach for the Bears and Luke Getze and how they call this series right here for the Bears offense. And Chicago trying to get something going. Again, Blashing game, the running back. You got Herbert on the bench. They give it to Blashing game. Really more of a fullback, obviously than a running back. Picks up five here, second down. Again, the snap. Just keep an eye on that. Think about this. During these 14 games that the Bears have lost during this losing streak. Fields has had nine fourth-quarter turnovers. Nine in the fourth quarter. We saw one last week against Denver. So still a long way to go, and part of his growth, part of his development is finding ways to secure a win. Up 10 with 10 minutes to go. Last week, a very costly interception, a very costly fumble. There he goes. Front down to 10 minutes. Fields keeps it himself. Takes a shot as he picks up about three. Cam Curl and Danny Johnson are both there. It's 32. Good tackle here by Danny Johnson. I'm telling you, Fields is a low to bring down. Good job of getting low, keeping him short by the first down. But Johnson continues to be in this game for Emmanuel Forbes. Bears need a drive to take some time off the clock. Third and two. Snap a little low. Field throws. And it's incomplete. Intended for Moore. Broken up there by St. Juice. So at a time in the game when you're actually trying to get some first downs, take some time off the clock, they have the ball for 90 seconds. Yeah, and a heck of a play here by St. Juice. Look at the length that he has. Got him there a little bit early with the left arm. Always hesitate when Terry shakes his head like that. Yeah, we've got a monitor. We can see Terry. He's behind my cup of junior minutes. We can see him. Here's the kick by Gill. They're caught at the 20-yard line by Crouch. He's had more time to throw. He's been able to be more decisive with his decision-making, and he's putting the ball in some tight windows because he is getting the ball out much faster, and his receivers are making some big-time plays here for him downfield to give this offense and this team a chance to fight back Getting to this game. Down by 10. For a game that was 27-3 at the half, it's turned into a game. Bears fans have just been holding on for dear life. They were starting to see ghosts there for a while. Yeah. From the 20-yard line. This drive begins. Howl in the pocket. Howl in the outside. That's incomplete. Wasn't going anywhere anyway. 10 for Gibson, second out of 10. It's worth mentioning that this Bears front has not been able to generate much pressure as far as finishing and coming up with sacks. Just two sacks all year coming in. But somebody forgot to tell them that tonight. They've done a pretty admirable job of affecting Sam Howe using twists and bringing backers and just being more aggressive than they've been in recent weeks. See that mug look right now walking up to backers. Extra man, pressure coming. Pass up to the 35-yard line, a Curtis Samuel. He scored the last touchdown. Pulls that baby in for 15. It was mug backers. One of them ends up coming, Edmonds. Edwards ends up dropping, so there's a nice hole behind the linebackers. See, Samuel wants the ball right away. He's a yards after the catch guy himself, but there was a nice throwing lane with the backers up tight. Curtis with four catches. Howell dancing around. Howell starts to take off. Doesn't go very far. Dix stops him. Gain of one, second and nine.

Terrell Smith. How about this effort?
