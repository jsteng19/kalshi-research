 So on this drive, which began back at their own 23, five plays, all runs. This offense is without Mark Andrews and now without Rashad Bateman, who's in the locker room. So you're at three points. You've not been able to close the deal in the red zone. Twice inside the red zone, a field goal. Went for it on fourth down on the other chance that they had and missed it. And now you've got your top two targets on the outside that are not in the lineup. Second and nine. Flip it out here. Caught by Duvernay. And the speedy one down the sideline. He goes inside the 20-yard line and a first down. So he's got a counter play going to his right. But if he sees the look that he wants to his left with a couple tight ends out in front of Duvernay, he's going to take it. Gets off of that handoff. flips it outside, and now you've got Duvernay and a couple great blocks by Likely, and of course, Ricard, who's just going to lead you. He gets out in front, you've got the blocks, and I'd always get behind 42 if I had the football in my hands. Crowe Bowler, over 300 pounds. Sometimes he plays on the defensive line or has anyway in the past. Back to the ground. Chugging through the middle this time is Kenyon Drake. So the Ravens this season, Kirk, they win, lose, win, lose every week. And there goes Barrett back to the locker room. That is a big blow. Check on what that is. Sure is. You're right. Ankle. It has been back and forth, back and forth, odd week, even week. Right. They've been, I think you would describe it as consistently inconsistent. Very true. And what's crazy is with the big leads in the fourth quarter. Right. Turned the ball over and self-destructed. Seven turnovers alone in the fourth quarter. Tonight they're playing from behind. Anthony Nelson comes in for Barrett. Play fake. Pass caught. First down. Duvernay makes the grab. And from the five-yard line, it's a first and goal. What a design here by Greg Roman. Ricard goes in motion. You're going to see the RPO. You're going to read 45 right there. He clears out. Once he clears out, you've got the underneath throw. If he would have stayed wide, you hand it off. He goes with Ricard, takes himself out, and now you've got a great passing lane and an easy throw. Ninth play of the drive. Ricard again moving. Caught. Touchdown. Kenyon Drake into the end zone. So they go marching down the field. Six runs, three passes, takes five minutes, and can time the game with the extra point. Now that's Ravens football right there. And a great job of coming off of this fake and getting it out of his hands quickly over O'Connor. O'Connor's got some good length. Realized that he's going to be right in his face, and so he comes around prepared to make that throw and instantly gets it out there where Drake can catch it and get to the corner. O'Connor has such good length. He was the man who blocked the field goal at the end of the first half. Kicked by Tucker is good. And so, with 9.05 remaining in the third, we are locked up. 10-10. Back out, likely at the 25-yard line, because Tucker normally boots it through the end zone. And as predicted. All right, so we looked at those numbers. I don't want to understate it. Right. Why is the scoring so far down this year? I think when the scoring is up, you talk about offense. You don't talk about the offensive line play. It's the quarterbacks and receivers. I think the high-profile quarterbacks, in many cases, are in new situations with offensive linemen and skilled people that they're trying to adjust to. Preseason, you don't see a lot of guys play. So I think September football is becoming preseason football. And I think it'll get better as the season goes on when these teams have a chance to get more accustomed to playing with some of these new players. Brady to his rookie, Rashad White. And he's able to get 20 on the pass and the yards after the pass. First down. He's got game-breaking speed. Not just a runner, but as you see, he can do it as a receiver. They're incredibly elusive with quicks. And all you've got to do is check it down and get him the ball in space, and he can make people miss. Through the middle. Here goes White again. So a 20-yard reception, an 8-yard... Quick. Pass. 8-yard gain. Scotty Miller makes his first grab of the night on his first target. Interesting adjustment over the last few series, which has helped Mike McDonald's defense putting Marlon Humphrey on the slot. Godwin, which has been hurting them earlier in the game. Minute and a half, and that's batted and incomplete. Setting up what will be a third down and two for the Bucs. Each team with all three timeouts. Good push that time by Broderick Washington. Can't get to Brady, but he gets that right hand up to knock it down. Went straight in the air. And now a timeout is taken here. Taken by the Ravens. So, we can tell you, coming up on the Mercedes bench. Boy, the Ravens get off the field here. After that opening drive, touchdown, they have really settled in. Made some good adjustments. Brady. Deep. Into coverage, and it's caught. Mike Evans. Into the Bucs bench he goes. So Tom goes long on a third and two, and they're out near midfield. He gets pressure, too. Literally, as he throws his ball, he's getting pressure. That's incredible coverage by the rookie Williams, but a better throw. There's the pressure right there. Ooh. Yeah, close. Very close. Low roll hit. Yep. 28-yard game. Brady throws. Fournette up to the 50-yard line. He goes second down. I thought Matabike would have gotten a personal foul, add 15 yards onto that. Yep. Only time Brady ever got seriously hurt was on a play like that, too, back in 2008. And this time Tom gets sacked. And by the way, that is sort of a historic sack here. It's just the first time he goes down. Tonight he is now. And we'll tell you, stick around. We're back in 30 seconds, and I'll reveal it for you. Third down in 14. Blitz coming. Picked up nicely. Brady, though, can't find anybody open. And down he goes again. So Justin Houston, been in the league 12 years. Long time with KC. And Tom Brady now owns the record by himself. So Ben has to put him over. It is over. Houston comes from here and gets home. But it's the coverage downfield. See Evans working on the right against Peters. He's taken away. The crosser's taken away. Nobody to check it down to. and a big fella out of Georgia in his 12th year back-to-back sacks. This time he credits the coverage downfield. And as I said, give Mike McDonald and this Ravens defense a lot of credit for the way they've settled into this game after that opening drive. And Justin Houston has six sacks in five games this season. Camarda into punt. 56 seconds. and the Ravens if you're taking a timeout will have one when they get the ball. Duvernay backing up. Fields at the 6. Gets tripped up at the 13. Way back. From the 13 yard line. Jackson flips it out here. Getting out of bounds. Stop on the clock. This can be great. Short gain there. 41 seconds left. Second down. Interesting decision here. Backed up. Haven't had great field position. They still want to go after this secondary with a lot of new faces. Thought they might just work the clock and get out of here and make their adjustments to get ready for the second half. But they're still believing Lamar. And remember, they've got the best kicker that maybe has ever played the game. But missing their tight end right now. Andrews. Jackson, as he does so often, is able to escape and picks up a first down up to the 29-yard line. That's Isaiah Likley. He's had a nice half. Sure has. Three catches, 33 yards. Timeout taken. And again, he has some really good instincts as a receiver. Very active in his college career. Whether it's zone or man, he seems to just have a knack for getting open. This time it was more of a zone. He knows that his quarterback is scrambling, so he just starts to kind of feel the coverage and just kind of work around, get around Devin White, try to get his hands up, let him know, hey, I'm here, I'm here. He was able to pick up that first down. With Lamar back there, you're always potentially in play. The play just seems like it's never over. Half a minute. No timeouts for the Ravens. the Ravens started out that way to say hey you know what we're going to throw it more than run it yeah you got some young people back there I don't think Greg Roman he's going to obviously mix in the run but he wants to test his secondary pick up the pace here go no huddle pass to the outside Robinson is able to stay in bounds and take the ball all the way down to the 17 breaking away from Zion McCollum first down with three minutes to go to the half much like Brady it's quick throws from Lamar Jackson. Greg Roman, you know, you see two or three series, you start to see, okay, Todd Bowles is going to dial it up, just like the scouting report says. And my answer to that is get my guy out, the ball out of his hands quickly and just try to hit, find the matchup to our advantage. And right now that's against a rookie, McCollum. Five plays on this drive, all passes. deep drop serving fires way out of the end zone it'll be second down with 225 left see that time they don't bring the pressure but they spy him with Devin White just in case he takes off and wants to use his feet keep in mind now you don't have your top target Mark Andrews you see You see White right here. They're not bringing the pressure. Just trying to keep him in the pocket. Eyes on him just in case he takes off. And there's Devin White waiting on him. So he just has to throw it away. But again, your top target, Mark Andrews, not here right now. He's in the locker room. How do they execute? Who can step up down here? Low that time. He's trying to go to Robinson's way once again. He's already caught five tonight. makes it third down and ten for the Ravens. Lamar, as soon as he threw it, he knew. He'd been bent over in frustration. In trying to hurry, he short arms to throw and ends up well short of his intended receiver, Robinson. Let's see, he says, that one's on me. likely he's going to have to step up now for Mark Andrews. Fired over the middle and caught at the 10-yard line. And that time it is likely they go to it again. But he's about three yards shy of the first down. So it's going to be fourth and three. And they can take this down to the two-minute warning, which they will do. Two minutes. In L.A., a handoff to Cowboys running back Tony Pollard turned into a big play. With blocks from teammates Tyler Bionish and Simi Feoko, he ran through the Rams' defense for a 57-yard touchdown. Get the toppings you crave fast when you order online for carryout. Skip the line and go directly to Pizza Portal Pickup at Little Caesars, the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. Pizza, pizza. So what are the Ravens going to do right now? It is fourth down and two. Ball is at the nine-yard line. Jackson went over to talk to Harbaugh, Similar to what happened last year in the Kansas City Sunday night game. He's telling Justin Tucker, no, no, no. Get off the field. We're going for this. Yep. I remember your game last year. Remember Coach Harbaugh? He looks over. What do you want to do? What do you want to do? Yeah. Next-gen stats powered by AWS. Chance of converting. Slightly more running it. What quarterback ever said send the field goal to him? Ever. Ever. They bring Drake back into the backfield. Could be just trying to draw him offside. The play clock is down to five. Nope. They're going for it. Pump fake throws. And incomplete. Broken up by Jamel Dean. Intended there for Demarcus Robinson. So they pass up the three. Trying to get the seven. And still trailed by seven. He wanted to get the ball to Pro Shea right here. The underneath, that's his initial read. Watch him look right here. He wants to make this throw. See his arm cocked, but Neal takes it away. And then he has to kind of create after that. Puts the ball, kind of floats it in the air, which allows Dean to be able to break on the football. And the Buccaneers say thank you very much. They'll take over, and they will get the second half kickoff as well. Brady back to work from the 10. They're going to say it's a shoulder. He's been bothered by a knee. Knight started out so promisingly with two catches on the first two plays. Fought three overall, but back to the locker room he goes. Stout now with his fourth punt of the night. any Faircats fall for and made with some acrobatics by Jalen Darden inside the fifth. You never count him out despite the intensity and everything that's going on on and off the field. He's always come up with an answer. You know, he's always been able to put the pieces back together. I think he likes the challenge of it. I think he has the team this year that can still have a very, very successful year. Well, everybody wants to play armchair psychiatrist, right? him. He misses 11 days in training camp. He goes to Robert Kraft's wedding and misses a walkthrough and goes to Pittsburgh and they lose the game. Everybody's saying he's distracted. Might be, but I'll tell you what. The competitive juices in him flow like almost nobody I've ever seen. Second down and eight. Brady going deep downfield to Evans and he can't hold on. Incomplete. Got Humphrey back there covering on the plate. It'll be third and eight. And I think all of us who have followed him all these years and been around him, that's the thing you appreciate and respect the most. Is it 45 or 25? How competitive he is every single day, not just on game day. Evans put that left hand up because he gets separation there from Humphrey, but give credit to Humphrey for catching up. I think Evans wanted the ball earlier to have a chance to run away from Humphrey, but he's able to get his hands on that ball. Third and eighth. five minutes to halftime stepping up in the pocket fires low a one hopper he's incomplete so it's fourth and eighth and Tom right now is seven of 13 for 102 yards pretty tight coverage that time Mike McDonald is playing more zone this year than we've seen from the Ravens defense in the past and that time he had two defenders Humphrey and Queen able to squeeze Godwin on that play. This is Camarda's second punt. Duvernay. Dancing. Can't get away. Tackle back to his own 38 with 4. 48. Remaining in the first half. Tampa Bay by seven. He's on the field with both those guys when they were visiting. We were talking about their days at Iowa. And estimate they could wrestle in college if they didn't play football. And they both said they probably could. This drive begins with a quick flip to the near side here. And a very short gain for Kenyon Drake. Gain of a couple. Here's a look at what they've gone up against tonight. Especially for the rookie, Linderbaum, who's gone up against some big men. And Vitavia, who's able to push through and come up with a sack, works on the other side as experienced. Boy, he is technically about as sound of an offensive lineman as you'll find in the NFL now in his third year. Ricard stays in the block, gives Jackson time to find the open man, and he does. And forward progress will net a first down there for Isaiah. Yeah, likely the rookie out of Coastal Carolina fourth-round pick. So Todd Bowles continues to bring the pressure, and the only thing is Levante David just a little bit late, and then you get separation. Mentioned likely, even though he's listed as a tight end, has great wide receiver skills. Rookie Coastal Carolina, where he caught the ball 59 times, almost 1,000 yards receiving. So very accustomed to running routes and getting open. Andrew's still in the locker room that pass is too high intended for Bateman first time they have looked his way tonight the number one pick out of Minnesota last year, second and ten this secondary has four contributors out, including a couple corners that would be playing, Carlton Davis the starter, Murphy Bunning so they're going after the fourth corner, the rookie Zylan McCollum, who we've seen tonight been pretty good, he's known for his speed. He's one of these guys that goes to the combine from a smaller school and shows out and really got that opportunity running a 4-3 at that combine. Pass caught and that will move to 6. Demarcus Robinson having a nice first half here. You know, I'm wondering, you just mentioned with the injuries to that secondary, maybe that's why as he takes it out to the 39-yard line for a Tampa Bay first down. They're moving people around right now up front. Shaq Mason that time with a great kickout block. It opened it up. Watch the right guard here. 69 comes down. Feels clean. The linebacker pushes him out. And Leonard Fournette's able to get underneath it. The reason that's important if you're a Tampa Bay fan, as we all know, when Brady starts to get that running game going, the play action follows. And they've not been able to do that the last few weeks. in the pocket, gets it away quickly. And that's another nine-yard gain, this time, to one of the tight ends, Cole Kieffitt, to make it second down and one. They're missing, of course, their top tight end, Cameron Brait. And you've got Otten, a rookie. You've got Rudolph, another guy who could play. And Kieffitt, who's a rookie as well out of Minnesota. Yeah, and he's really known as a blocker. That time just slipped right over the middle of that defense. He blitzed the middle linebacker, opening it up. Of course, Brady sees it quickly, and the ball is out. 3-18. Six of lights. We got a piece of seats. 3-18. On second and one, throws caught. That's Godwin. And Godwin will take it deep into Ravens territory. Geno Stone finally forcing him out of bounds. So it was second and one. Brady throws it over the middle for 44. This is an example, when they run the football, what happens to these linebackers. See him hesitate. Now he gets his head on a swivel, and it's too late. That's where Brady finds the rhythm. Everybody's wondering, what's wrong with Brady? What's wrong with his offense? Let his offensive line open up some holes and run the football, and then you can get that ball out quickly off play action right behind where those linebackers would be. Very quickly, which he's been doing all season long. Otten in motion. Fournette can go nowhere, taken down back of the line of scrimmage. Devon Kennard making the stop right there. It'll be second down and goal from the 10. This Baltimore defense with a new defensive coordinator, Mike McDonald, who was, of course, at Baltimore from 14 to 20, went to Michigan. Last year, John Harbaugh's brother, Jim, called the defense. Tonight, he wants to see Kennard and others step up. Al, you mentioned Calais Campbell being out. That is a huge changeup to this game. and an advantage for Tampa in the trenches, an area that they've struggled. Godwin moving, sets up on the wing. Play action. Brady surveying. Lofts one to the back of the end zone. Are his speed in is the question? No. Mike Evans, and there's a flag, our first of the game. So Brady lofting one through a change up to the back of the end zone, but Evans could not stay in. We'll get the call from Carl Shepard. On the Marcus Peters. First and goal. He was tied up there with Mike Evans, who's working across. And after he got locked up with him, just right here, watch, he's trying to get to our left. Working across, get that first step initially at the line of scrimmage. And all you can do there if you're Peters is hold on for dear life. From the five, Fournette. Leonard Fournette gets it to the one-yard line. Great-looking drive here. Four runs, three passes, started at their own 25-second goal. How good is that to see, to run the football like that? So the last 25 drives for the Bucs, they've entered the end zone once. Second and goal. Cornette, he takes it in for the touchdown. Left behind the veteran left tackle, Donovan Smith. And he goes 75 yards and looks sharp doing it. And Josh Wells comes in to play tight end on the left side. You see him right here. These two just opened things up on that left side. This offensive line, the much maligned offensive line, they've had a lot of injuries. It's the opening drive. That is a heck of a job against this Ravens defense of opening things up and protecting Brady. Looked like a different team from the team we watched last week on their opening drive. That's Tampa Bay's third rushing touchdown of the season. Ryan Suckup converts. and almost seven minutes to go in the opening quarter. Bucks go down the field and take the lead. This has been a trouble area, scoring touchdowns and when we talked with Lamar, he emphasized tonight against Brady, they've got to get touchdowns down here. Ravens 15th takeaway, that is Tops in the lead and Jackson gets swallowed up after the fake to Drake. Shaq Barrett is right there to stuff him in the backfield. That's a misread there by Lamar Jackson. That's the man he's reading, and Barrett gives him a tough read because he actually goes out like he's going to take the back, and then he settles and comes underneath. He gave that kind of false feel to Lamar that he might be taking that receiver in motion there, the back, Kenyon Drake, and then collapsed underneath. Good job of fooling him. First 12 drives this season. Ten touchdowns the last 12. Only four. Can they catch him here? Second and goal. To the five. That's caught there. That's James Crochet. Making only his second catch of the season. Third and goal for the Ravens. Todd Bowles with a wrinkle there down in a tight area. Just rushing three. Eight guys in coverage. Everybody's eyes trying to take away those tight zones there. All eyes on Lamar. Only thing you can do is get rid of it quickly to Prochet. Incidentally, a receiver that they want to get more and more involved this third year out of SMU. So they pushed Delaney back in. You saw that from the sideline. He's praying he can make a play to stop him here. After he ran into the punt returner, it's third down and goal from the four-yard line. Jackson fires broken up broken up there by Zion McCollum who's a rookie at a Sam Houston State so once again the Ravens having trouble in recent games in the red zone and that's the case again here look at the defensive backs communicating see that switch release Neal and the rookie McCollum had to communicate because of what happens initially at the line of scrimmage receiver and the tight end switching, and a great job in the back end of that secondary one. There's some inexperience of making that a Justin by the rookie McCollum. Don't have to tell you, if you follow the game, Justin Tucker may be the best of all time at field goals and extra points. And right down Broadway, or right down Dale Mabry anyway, since we're in Tampa, to put him on the board. Four minutes into the game. The messed up putt, but it only cost him three, three-nothing. And after the turnover, the takeaway by the Ravens. Yeah. They'll kick off again here with Tucker sending it down toward Jalen Darden. Great opportunity there for Baltimore, but a big stop by Tampa. Stop with a great hang time on that punt. And they get the turnover, but only three points. Now they put Rashad Whitey, rookie from Arizona State, back at the goal line. And White will let it bound through the end zone. And that means our first look at the GOAT comes at the 25-yard line. So what numbers do we want to show you with Tom tonight? 37 passes per touchdown would be the lowest of his career. This team is averaging 17.7 points per game. Career low in the first seven games of any season for Tom. Last year they were second in the league in scoring. Now they're 25th. And Julio Jones, who's active tonight and has missed the last three games, right into the action. Brady, looking in that direction but incomplete. Contended there for Cade Otten, rookie tight end out of Washington. What a play by Humphrey coming off of his man downfield. Almost puts himself in position for that interception. He throws that ball out in front of Otten. And this is only the first play. But this is an example of what we've been seeing in recent weeks. Just out of sync. Just a little bit here or there. And that time with Humphrey coming off of his guy, his instincts almost led him to an interception. Cornette is the running back. Leonard's first carry of the night is a good one. Still fighting his way for a nine-yard game. Geno Stone makes the tackle. It will be third down and one. You hear the crowd reacting because this offense has not been able to run the football. and it's good to see number seven getting downhill and running north and south where he is so dangerous. And we're going to keep an eye on the left guard, Nick Lebert. He had a great block there, but there you see it. 64 yards a game and three yards a carry both last in this league. He had one big game that was opening night in Dallas into triple figures, but since then averaging about 40 yards per game. The running game has been basically nonexistent. Third and one high snap, and he gets it to Fournette. And a good start for number seven. Motion, try to affect the eyes of these linebackers. Good job by Edwards. Going to the right, able to cut back, just following the instincts, running the grass. Mix in a little bit of tempo, change the tempo, falls out of the hands when they are throwing quickly, and then mix in some of that read game where you can give it or keep it yourself. Sir Andrews with that knee. Can't get back in yet. Drake. Picks up a couple. Delaney and a flag is thrown. Only the second one of the first half. Carl Sheffers warming up his larynx. Yeah. Pass interference. Number three. Offense. Ten-yard penalty. Replay first down. That's on a proche. I think Prochet thought the ball might be out a little bit quicker. He starts to block downfield against Dee Delaney. There he is right there. Actually, it looks like he's on Dean. Now it is Dee Delaney. And then he just, ball got out a little bit later than he anticipated. He downfield about 10 yards blocking So that was a first down play which takes him back to make it first down and 20 from their 44 line And all kinds of action up front Golston was the man who came across for Tampa Bay. Was he induced? Fairly lengthy discussion here. Possibly re-spotting the ball. This game has been so beautifully and quickly paced. It really has. Now they're saying they had it right. There is the Sean Jackson, who right now is not active, but they picked him up. Set the game clock to 720. 7-2-0, please. For the moment, he's on the practice squad. There was some possibility earlier in the week that maybe he'd be ready tonight. They've got a week and a half off, so maybe when they come back, he will be. Talked to some of the coaches on the field prior to the game. George Gossie, I said, you know, is he still having it? He raised his eyebrows and said, it's incredible. So look forward to seeing him eventually being active. Pass to the outside is caught at the 48-yard line by Demarcus Robinson. Kaylee, what you got? Al, we saw Jackson working up a sweat pregame. He told me he never stopped working out in the offseason, but he said that's not the same as being a part of OTAs and training camp with a team. He said for the last two weeks he's been doing extra conditioning. He assured me his wind is good. He also noted that this is a first for him, playing with a run-first team. He said, me being a big play threat, I'm interested to see our team as a player. He'll be 36 in December. Meanwhile, Jackson, like in a video game, all the way back inside his 30 and just dumps it into the first row of the stands. They're definitely going to get grounding here and the flag comes out. Henson will grounding. Number eight. Offense. Followed and replaced at the spot of the foul. Loss of down. Third down. Putting in our grounding box graphic here. You can see in the pocket. I mean, he just starts to run for his life. I mean, it's amazing. Again, it's Lamar Jackson. He keeps the play alive. Now he's going to go to our left, and then he just throws it. And then he threw it about, I don't know, 10 or 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Only the third intentional grounding call against him in his career. You saw something that happens very infrequently there, but it's now third and 36. and Justice Hill picks up a few sitting up fourth and a mile well they've either had bad field position or they've hurt themselves with penalties but they've been facing a lot of third down and longs and I thought at the very least there's a look at their best receiver Mark Andrews the big tight end four man rush Jackson hit as he throws flag down An incomplete cliche. Surrounded by a triumvirate. Looks like Zeitler got his hands up into the face. Personal foul. Face mask. Number nine. Defense. 15-yard penalty. Automatic. First down. Joe Tryon. So Inka. And that's going to move him ever closer to, you know, I mean, you've got Justin Tucker. 65 is in play. Yeah. Yeah, even 70. You know, we saw him in pregame. it's a good call here three fingers into the face mask but an incompletion and it's a 15 yard gain and now you try to get quick, you get 25 seconds get a completion spot to fire the ball and maybe get a shot here Tucker the man who picked a 66 yarder at Detroit last year, pressure coming Jackson throws, leaping catch made, 43 yard line That's Prochet. Jackson coming up to spike it if he can. But now you're looking at the 61-yard attempt, and Jackson wasn't sure what to do at that point. And then he comes up and he looked at the bench and said he's going to spike it. And this is exactly what they wanted to do. This is pregame, and that's from 70. I mean, it's good from 71. Look at this. His own 40. Well, not too many kickers go to the Hall of Fame. But he will. Going out on a limb. I think you're good there. He's coming out again. Second and ten. And that's the only way they can stop the clock with four seconds. We have Morton Anderson. He's in the Hall of Fame. Jan Stenerud. I was just about to... Is it two? It's two. Benetari, I think Adam is going to be ready to have a chance. That'd be your third, I would think. This guy's got a long way to go in his career. So a 61-yard attempt. Jordan Stout to hold it for years. It's been Sam Cook, but he's retired. So now you've got the rookie holding it. He's 2 for 6 and 60-plus in his career. Now 2 for 7 because it's blocked. And that will take us to the break. Red zone and only come away with three points. Tucker, per usual, hoots it through the end zone. Kaylee, moments ago with John Harbaugh. Well, Coach, last we heard you had key players on both sides of the ball, questionable to return. Do you have an update on the status of Mark Andrews or Marlon Humphrey? We're not making any updates. We're just focusing on coming out and moving the ball, trying to put some good drives together, finishing the red zone. It's a one-score game. We're excited to see if we can go win it. What needs to happen to put those drives together? We've got to execute and make some plays. Thanks. That is the one-size-fits-all answer, right? We've got to execute and make some plays. Here's Fournette up to the 29-yard line. Humphrey is out there. Marlon Humphrey in the lineup right now to start the second half. Dean to four. It'll be second down and six. You got a feeling that Byron Leftwich, as a play caller, is going to go back to that opening drive where they just had everything going. They were running the football. Offensive line was getting a push, setting up Brady in that play-action game. But they were running downhill. Brady 10 of 17 for 142. And on second down and six, swings it to the outside and incomplete. It wouldn't have gone anywhere anyway. Evans dropping it right there. Brady. Yeah, Brady has been known coming into tonight, he gets the ball out at 2.25 or faster. Fastest in the entire league. Fastest in his career. You can see for the most part, that's held up again true tonight. Especially early in this game when he's had some success. Quick throws where they've had a cushion. Just kind of aborts the play. gets the ball out on the edge. Here this time, those throws now are being taken away. Got tighter coverage. You can see the frustration there between Brady and not being able to connect there with Mike Evans. Third down and six on the opening drive of the second half. Swing into the outside. Look out. He's already been sacked twice and dumps that one off. So Brady sacked twice near the end of the first half. Adophe Owe put the heat on that time, and it's a quick three and out. Yeah, that's what the Ravens have wanted to see from Owe, is being able to utilize his athletic ability his second year out of Penn State. They get the ball right away back to Lamar Jackson, the quick three and out of this Buccaneers offense. and that streak and that trend continues for the Ravens' defense, playing much better. Jake Kamarda, a rookie out of Georgia's, punted three times tonight, averaging 51 yards per boot. Five-yard penalty, fourth down. And to back him up five. Duvernay backing up still backing up at the 11 and the only man with a run back for a touchdown this season in the entire league will not get another here 65 yard 11 yard return Baltimore there it is right there incredibly unusual And again, it goes back to maybe, you know, Roman thinking about all the issues in that secondary. And we'll see what he does now in the second half. Yeah, I mean, and a big part of it, I think, is just trying to get this defense spread out with some new faces, trying to get them to make plays in the pass game. And, you know, Mark Andrews is his favorite target. We've seen him go out of this game. We've seen the rookie likely have to step up. You've got a feeling they're going to get back to their bread and butter and running the football. With Lamar Jackson only has a couple carries on the night. Running back is Edwards. Lamar will keep it himself. Exploits that home. Keeps his balance. And gets that at midfield. Great run by Lamar Jackson for the first down. What's incredible is this is his own read, and he actually misreads it. This is how good this guy is. This is a give. and he's still able to get underneath it. I mean, this is why we all marvel at what Lamar Jackson can do. He's a cheat code to a video game. He's just, he's not fair. He misreads it, and yet the guy that he's misread, he makes miss. Picks up a first down in big yards. 25 yards. Keep it on the ground. Take the ball into Tampa territory. Goes Gus Edwards for a short game. They're going to test these linebackers in this defensive line. and get back to Ravens football with the tight ends. Ricard, who is a fullback, he's going to take you usually to the football, but get physical, not abandon, obviously, the run game, but try to establish the line of scrimmage, and then get some one-on-one shots downfield to Bateman or Duvernay, or Prochet, who has stepped up. Robinson's their leading receiver tonight. He's caught five. Give it to Edwards. Nice run. Setting up a third down and one. We go back to Kaylee. Al, the Ravens offense is going to have to figure out how to fight back in this one score game without Mark Andrews. We have just been told he has ruled out for the rest of the game with a shoulder injury. Yeah, he started out so brilliantly tonight. Two catches, first two plays, and then the shoulder here. On that play. Third and one. Edwards. Gets it. And a lot more. To the 31 goes Gus. First down. Test these safeties and these linebackers. Their willingness to get physical. That's the kind of game you want to play if you're Baltimore. Outside zone play. Much of good double team. Missed tackle right there by Neal. Devin White overruns the play. Good vision, by the way, by Gus Edwards getting back underneath that defense. It's running fast to make a play. Getting to the outside, he cuts underneath him. Meanwhile, that defense now has Shaq Barrett, who is down on the grass to get some attention. Had a real good first half. This on this secondary from the Buccaneers. Remember, four contributors out. Been relying on some younger players. McCollum, the rookie. Dean, who, of course, is a veteran, has been around. But they have held up for the most part. They were challenging. Surprised all of us. The Ravens and Greg Roman coming out, really airing it out and challenging some of those new faces. But now it looks like they're going back to start this second half to the bread and butter run in the football. Barrett was assisted to the bench. Edward. JPP moving on. They opted not to sign him. They just thought Tryon Shoyanka has so much upside. They're just waiting for him to emerge and become that guy in his second year out of Washington. He's big at 6'5", 260, and really explosive. Second and 11. Running back is Justice Hill. He takes it. Take hold. Justice Hill for a first down. He did 11, got 13. Nassib makes the stop there with 3.5 to go in the quarter. I keep waiting for Devin White to be Devin White and just fill these holes and get active and get aggressive and get downhill. But a good job by the right side of this offensive line. Devin White's respecting the threat of Lamar Jackson. By the time he figures out where the play is, he's got a tackle on Morgan Moses right in his face, driving him off the line of scrimmage and opening up a huge hole for Justice Hill. Edwards back in the backfield. Gets it again. Short game. Second and long. A little thing like that orbit motion. You know, you're constantly, I think Greg Roman as a play caller, is challenging the communication and the eye discipline of the linebackers and the safeties. And as they get tired, and I see some hands on the hips, As they get tired, you don't just get physically tired, you get mentally exhausted on these longer drives. And that's when they really, you know, pre-snap movement, check the discipline of this defense. Eighth play of the drive. Five runs, two passes. The sixth run here goes nowhere. They stuff him when they really needed to. Nunez, Roches, making the tackle. Their big third down upcoming. Third down and nine. Pat O'Connor on the left side here. He goes all the way around. Levante David forces Lamar Jackson out. But that was a heck of an effort there by Big 79. play clock at three, fakes the give, throws to the outside and picking up the first down, and a lot more, Demarcus Robinson, the one-time Kansas City Chief in his seventh season at the University of Florida, a game there of 15. Again, he has the two tight ends out in front of a skill player. He's going to give him a chance, see what Demarcus Robinson can do, make these guys tackle you. What a move inside, back, outside to allow the block to be set up by Josh Oliver, 84. Doesn't get a push in the back. That cut to the outside allows him to pick up that safety Mike Edwards. A heck of an effort there by Robinson. The depleted Tampa Bay defense will now face their 58th play. The Ravens on pace to run about 80. Carry here by Justice Hill in the final minute of the third. good point about the injuries and some of the new faces and then you add in Greg Roman's plan, make them run and chase the pass game in the first half and then try to lean on them in the second half, it's a plan that's really working out with a lot of new faces, like I said, look at the hands on the hips, that's a tired defense right now This drive's six and a half minutes old Hill is still in there Second and seven. Jackson surveys. Under pressure. Throws. And it's in the back of the end zone. Hold in there by Likely. Touchdown. Boy, that rookie is having some night. He sure is. This is Lamar Jackson, really, in a nutshell. When you watch what his body language says and where he wants to go with his football. He wants to make the throw to this receiver working right here, Prochet. Watch his eyes and watch him want to throw it right there, but he keeps the play alive. I thought he might go here, but instead he goes to the back edge and finds the rookie for the touchdown. That's a lot in about three or four seconds. Man, oh man. Yep. Clearly in. Clearly have the lead. he's now caught five has been targeted six times first career touchdown for him Mark Jackson in action you got Jake Camarda who's going to kick off Devin Duvernay who has the only run back of either a kickoff or a punt this season in the entire league for a touchdown just one in seven weeks he's back to receive so the Bucks may be three and four but in the NFC South, they are tied for first place, and Duvernay will have a chance to run it back from the goal line. And one of the most dangerous return men in the league is able to get around the corner and take it out to about the 22-yard line. So versus the other conference, the NFC for Lamar Jackson in his career, 12-1, an almost 5-1 ratio TDs to interceptions. He faced Tom Brady when Brady was in his conference back in 2019. Baltimore against New England and beat him. Kenyon Drake starts at running back. We'll see him. We'll see Gus Edwards. We'll see Justin Hill tonight. And the Ravens begin with a pass. Fired over the middle and caught. And that's Mark Andrews, the great tight end, who ironically did not catch a single pass last week in his 73rd career game. That's a game of 23. Jamal Dean almost gets in the way of his plant corner here. He sinks in coverage. And I don't think Lamar really sensed or felt him. Look how close that is right there. But a good job getting it right away to his main target, Mark Andrews. As you said, Al, did not have a catch last week. great great job first play of the game saying we're getting 89 involved tonight he is their leading receiver from the 43 yard line the fake to drake the pass to the outside so you don't throw to him at all last week or doesn't catch one anyway he had two targets and they start the game with the first two plays going right to number 89 well they know this defense of course all eyes are on number eight so greg Roman is coming up with a plan right now. Put the ball in the hands of Lamar Jackson. This defense is revved up after the way they played last week. They're back home, kind of in a must-win mindset, flying around with eyes on Lamar. What better way to attack than get the ball out of his hands and throw the football, kind of break some of the trends. Second and five. They won't go to Andrews this time as he just went to the sideline. sets it up for Kenyon Drake, and he's forced out of the 45-yard line. Dee Delaney came in on the blitz from the secondary to make a third down and eight after a loss of three. Like what Todd Bowles told us this week, he calls the defense as a head coach, and he said, you know, we don't want to just have that mush pass rush against Lamar Jackson. We need to be aggressive. We need to attack, and we can attack and still play zone and have eyes on him with the threat and the potential of when he takes off and he's so dangerous. So Todd Bowles, he has never in his career faced Jackson. He was with the Jets before Jackson got into the league and didn't face him. Even though they may have crossed paths one time during that schedule, during that season, and it's fired over the middle into a lot of traffic and busted up. So they try to go to Andrews again, who made two grabs on this, and you've got a double team there, Keanu Neal and Levante David break it up. Fourth and nine. Watch Levante, David. You get blitz here. Watch how he turns his body. He knows that Andrews is to his left or right. Right away gets his body turned, anticipating that on third down, Lamar's going to dial him up. One of the best cover linebackers in the league and makes the play there on third down. Jordan Stout, a rookie from Penn State. For so many years, of course, it was Sam Cook who did the punting. Jalen Darden back to receive. Close four. The fair catch. His own man runs into him, and the ball is loose at the six-yard line. So Darden is back there. D Delaney, the safety who blitzed when Baltimore had the ball, runs into his own man on what would have been a fair catch, and that sets Baltimore up first and goal. And that's just communication. You know, you've got to be able to communicate. Darden, of course, is locked in on the ball. Delaney just loses where he is. absolutely no reference at all of where the football is and give Justice Hill to Gunner a lot of credit for working downfield like that and putting Delaney right into the position where that ball hits him. Gavon Seymour recovers it and it's a first and goal. Remember the last three games for the Raven. And they give it to Edwards and he can barely get out of the grasp of number 94 right there, Carl Nassib, and then does and turns what would have been a two-yard loss into a gain of 11. And Nassib and also Neal gets in there. Neal comes here, Nassib off the edge. Both of them have a chance to bring him down. And this is what I think, J.K. Dobbins out with the knee. Edwards comes back from the ACL a year ago, and what you get is physicality at 238 pounds. and they finally get a decent run that's good for 12 Jackson sliding away but not far enough and that is Shaquille Barrett having a big first half this is one way to make it easy on one of the better pass rushers in the league left tackle Stanley watch he pulls away from Barrett just a miscommunication he pulls away Barrett just gets immediately into the backfield even Gus Edwards didn't expect him to get in that quickly so a miscue up front between the play call with Lamar Jackson and the left tackle, Ronnie Stanley, who's a bright, one of the more experienced linemen you'll see. Couple of sacks for the Bucs. That's the third of the year for Barrett. Kenyon Drake is in the backfield here. Send him out outside and then caught up at the 21-yard line. So they go to Andrews, who caught passes on their first two offensive plays. and with a bonking knee, he came off after those first two catches and he has to come off here again, third down. Keep an eye on that. But Todd Bowles is, without a doubt, coming after Lamar Jackson. That's the plan. And they are known for their blitzing. They blitz as much as about anybody in this league. But another third down and long for Jackson in the Ravens offense. here they come to the outside and that's going to be hold in inbounds there by demarcus robinson the former kansas city chief and they pick up the first on a nine-yard gain he shows press on the far right now he looks like he's going to play man and they're going to press him and then he does press bail he just gets out gives him a soft cushion Great job of recognizing that on third down. Lamar Jackson says, thank you, we'll take it. Picking up the pace here. Again to the outside. And again, it is Robinson back-to-back. Catches for DeMarcus. And a pickup of six. Greg Roman sticking to his guns. You know, everybody flipped this game on tonight. Thought Lamar Jackson and Gus Edwards, the zone read, the power read, and the quarterback counter would be on display. And there we go, 18 plays, 15 passes. so far. Don't worry. The run is coming. It's eventually coming. As we mentioned, they run 49% of the time. Jackson will keep it himself. And pick up the first down before he's taken down there. White and Dean are there. First down. That's the bread and butter. They average 8 yards on these zone read. Any type of read play with Lamar Jackson has the ability to give or to keep it himself. Barrett came down. That was his read. And once he came down, pretty easy for Lamar to get outside of that. Send five again. Short flip caught there by Gene Prochet, who came into the game having caught one pass all season long, and now he has two grabs tonight. and Chava recognized, indeed Delaney, sneaking up there across from Crochet and blitzing. It's just kind of a hot, just get the ball out of your hands quickly by Lamar Jackson with that blitz across from his receiver. Just replaces it with a nice, easy throw against soft coverage behind that blitz. Andrews still on the sideline. Second and four. Edwards. Played for the first time since 2020 last week. Looked good. Gained 66 yards in their victory over Cleveland. It'll be third down and two. Nunez-Roches, a great play there. Head up on the nose again against the rookie center Linderbaum and gets off of his block using those hands and be able to make this play right in the middle. Linderbaum has his hands full tonight. Gets off of that, right there, makes the play. rookie center first round pick out of Iowa Edwards and he'll move the sticks taking the ball into Buccaneer territory with under 8 to play in the first half now this is starting to feel like Ravens football some quick game carry Harrison makes the tackle second and a deuce it's the first time we can talk about the offensive line execution up front since maybe the first drive Shaq Mason really good job Tristan Wirfs doing a good job Just watch this, as you like to say, Al, the execution. It's just everybody being able to pick up a man, and then you've got to back with good vision who's explosive. That's what they looked like in that first drive, and like we say, when you start to see that, Brady becomes so dangerous with the play action. Here's Julio Jones, who plays tonight for the first time in three weeks. So Julio Jones, of course, you know about his great career. He's going to come off slowly now. Missed the last three games with a knee injury. It doesn't look very good right here. But he's active tonight. Third and two, and back to the bench he goes. Well, you really can't test an injury like that. You can do a lot of things with you working out, but until you put those shoulder pads and that helmet on and you go live, that's the only time you're really going to find out how that thing feels. You see him back to the sideline. They need two. And that's underthrown. Evans was there. But behind him and low. That's fourth down. Mentioning some of the quarterbacks that are trying to work with some new skill. I think Brady's a great example of that. Everybody's pointing the finger at Tom Brady. But he's had a revolving door up front, especially at left guard. Then he started to look at the games missed with his skill players. go all the way down the list. Look at every receiver he would throw to has missed some games. And I think as good as he is, it's still a game of rhythm and repetition. And they're going to get there. And I know it's frustrating to have those growing pains, but that affects the continuity when you don't have them out there. Very. Putt. Bounds into the end zone off the foot. Apparently up front. Brady started out. Great drive. Opening drive. But since then, they've taken care of him. Have the Ravens. This is Duvernay. And he gets pushed out of bounds by Levante David after he picks up 17. This is more of what you expected to see tonight from Greg Roman and Lamar Jackson and how they're trying to attack now by running the football. Lamar Jackson likes to work the edges. Loves to run that threat of the read there If the end goes wide he hold on to it That time he collapsed so he just gives it to him and he got space around the corner Edwards is the back. Up to the 40-yard line, he goes. Second and eight. this is where this part of their offense I think is as challenging as anything for a defensive coordinator because you have to deal with the zone read game and it affects the eyes there's Mark Andrews who's now in street clothes and done for the night as Kaylee had mentioned but you get that zone read game going boy it's assignment football old school high school college football what you're defending it's very different from everything they see every week as a defense five and a half left in the third Drake you know one thing about the Ravens if they come out of here with a win tonight they'd go to five and three this team will play one game over the next 23 days you're talking about getting everybody healthy they go to New Orleans a week from Sunday and then they have their bye and then they meet Carolina don't you just you just kind of fall back on John Harbaugh and the Ravens and their DNA that if they stay healthy, they're going to be a factor. You know, had so many injuries last year. This is a team, like you said, if they get a win tonight, you better look out for Baltimore getting hot. Yeah, they lost just about every running back at one point last season. That is caught. And into Bucs territory. And shedding tacklers, pushing them away is Isaiah Likely. having a heck of a game. The rookie with a 17-yard gain, fourth-round pick, Coastal Carolina. Here he is right here again, has wide receiver skills, works across. He's got tight coverage with Jamal Dean. Watch this throw. I mean, we brag on Lamar Jackson as a runner, but the guy can sit in the pocket and throw with the best of him. Play action. Keeps it. Tackled from behind. knocking him down there is Tryon as he stuffs him just about at the line of scrimmage second down. Tryon the guy that they're hoping would really come on. For the first time this season back to back wins. 27 to 22 is our final with the post game show with Carissa, Tony, Fitz, Sherman, Witt wrapping things up after these messages. Second down. Even when I talked with Greg Roman this week, and I was talking about his receivers, and we start to get to the tight ends, talking about some of the personnel, and he goes, well, I'd really look at Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely, the rookie. Those are receivers. That's how he looks when he has these formations. Looks at Oliver and Boyle and Ricard as his true blocking tight ends and fullbacks. Jackson under pressure. Look out. And he will get swallowed up at the 10. Dieter Bayek with the celebration as he busts through the middle. A guy who always gets double-teamed is able to get through. 350 pounds of veteran, and this is good to see. Boy, he is athletic with those hands and getting away from the rookie, Linderbaum, who's got a bright future but is just overpowered. We've got to make sure we try to rally everybody to the ball. Thank you, Kelly. They've done a good job on him so far. This is DuVernay, and it'll be fourth and a mile. Delaney makes the tack. You know what's interesting, Kirk, is that we talked about the variances and how much they run and how often they line up with two running backs. So this is a team that runs 49% of the time. They passed it 11 times and run it twice. I kind of sense that they might try to break some of their tendencies and throw, but they're going to have to get their zone read game going. Jordan Stout fielded it to 31. Darden gets around the corner. Nice run back there after the 46-yard line. 56-yard boot, and we're back in a half minute. Let's hide in the attic. No, in the basement. Why can't we just get in the running car? Are you crazy? Let's hide behind the chainsaws. Smart. Are you okay? If you're in a horror movie, you make poor decisions. That's what you do. I'm being quiet. Breathing on me. If you want to save even more, you bundle your home and car insurance with GEICO. It's what you do. Back to the cemetery! Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung, and there is Tom Brady Sr. Who's in the San Francisco Bay Area. That's where Tom grew up. Watching his boy in action tonight. Running back is Rashad White, the rookie from Arizona State. Drafted in the third round. Take a look at him for a three-yard pickup out to the 48-yard line. Tom Brady and the Bucs offense giving the Ravens some of their own medicine. You know, we've seen Josh Wells, the backup tackle who's coming off the field now, lined up there as a tight end. We saw it in the red zone. Now here it's essentially going with their own 13 personnel, one back and three tight ends, trying to get a little push, trying to help this running game that has been spot on, especially in comparison to where it's been in recent weeks. White again. And he gets the ball just across the 50-yard line. Broderick Washington makes the tackle there. So it'll be third down and four for the Bucs. Can't emphasize it enough with Calais Campbell out with an illness. The onus falls on the guys like Broderick Washington, Travis Jones, Brent Urban. I'm out of BK. This defensive line, still a lot of talent. But they're going to have to start to get through some of these gaps and start to try to disrupt the timing of this running game. Passes not caught by Godwin, who had reached the line to gain and broken up by Geno Stone, fourth down. Geno Stone has had to step in with Marcus Williams out, but this guy's a playmaker. Look how he sells the cushion. Hey, Tom, you got it. You want the first down, you got it. and then immediately takes it away. I mean, that is a great play of baiting. Hey, Godwin, he's been hurting us with these quick throws. Give it to him on third down, and he eliminates it with that hit right when he had to, and the ball gets into the hands of Godwin. Camarna now to punt. Duvernay drifts over to the sideline and lets it bounce, hoping it would go into the end zone but it doesn't. It backs up and that was around him. Gus Edwards is the running back here. Smashing the tablet. He's going over what's working. I'm sure everyone's excited to see that. Gus Edwards is now the running back here over the middle. Caught at the 29 yard line. Josh Oliver making the grab there. The tight end second down. Really love this offense that Greg Roman has built around Lamar Jackson's skill set. Kind of an outlier in this league. You know, this world has spread and getting out in space. Greg Roman's a throwback. You know, he's going to be in a lot of two and three tight end looks and running the football and running zone read and power read and taking advantage of Lamar Jackson's skill set and his ability to throw off of that. A lot of play action looks. Puts a lot on a defense to get ready for, especially in a short week. The card is in motion Hand the ball off there But the defense right there to stop Gus Edwards ran into a wall Shaq Barrett amongst them It'll be third down and six It is nice to see Shaq Barrett Who's known mainly as a pass rusher Get involved This team overall, watch him work inside And watch him use his hands to get off the block To Boyle, who's a very talented and physical blocker He just got off of that quickness and burst Now this Tampa Bay team is tired of hearing about the noise and the critics. You just kind of feel it's an us against the world mentality inside this locker room coming into this game after the last couple weeks. Third and seven now. Justice Hill comes into the game as the third down back. Flare him out. Jackson under pressure. Looking. Scrambling. Throwing. Can't hit his man. Kept it alive a long time, trying to hit crochet, but couldn't fourth down. Chased by Barrett, who's been all over the place in the first quarter. Of course, on third down, you've got to do a good job on the edges of keeping him in that pocket. Now look in the back, look at all the defense, the linebackers and safeties. They know at any moment he could break out. And there's Levante David helping out with still coverage downfield. So great scheme there on third down by Todd Bowles. Stout the rookie. sends it down to Darden this time he catches it unimpeded and Darden gets tackled from behind up at the 37 yard line Leonard Fournette instead of dancing around trying to find holes getting a push up front running the ball and of course with 12 now you set up the play action and the quick decisions and quick throws to a guy like Godwin who can make plays after the catch they get it inside the 5 and instead of struggling in the red zone the way they have been they punch it in and get a touchdown mentioned at the top the word they use, execution and it was a very well executed first drive that looks good Peterson Humphrey back there in the secondary Brady will take the snap from the 37 to start this drive and he gives it to Fournette and this time the Ravens are right there so Wink Martindale after a decade on this staff as the defensive coordinator went to the Giants where he's doing a great job And Mike McDaniel is the new defensive coordinator. He had been on the staff. Then he went last year to Michigan with John's brother Jim and was the defensive coordinator for one year there. Yeah, he has paid his dues. He came up in his system, left to go work at Michigan, and now is ready to be the guy here. Brady throws open, making the grab. Evans gets tackled at the 40-yard line by Chuck Clark. the eyes of these underneath coverage playing some zone he's on the inside just kind of works his way across and all you're asking Brady is just trying to get him behind those linebackers find that soft spot in the zone in front of the safeties behind the backers and there's the accuracy there's the rhythm there's the continuity in this Bucs offense Tom three for his first four for 76 Quickly to Godwin. Nice little move there to net him nine yards. Godwin takes it to the 31-yard line. Second and one. Second time they're trying to get the ball to the slot. It's a strength of theirs with Godwin. By the way, how impressive is he with coming back from the ACL ten months, and he's out of that surgery and able to play and be dangerous. But he's a threat after the catch in the slot, and that's been a trouble spot for this Ravens defense, trying to find the right guy to play that position. Second and one. Toss it to Fournette. Tries to cut it back inside and should have. The forward progress the first down. Three minutes to go in the quarter. Well, there's the familiar man, man, but in a very unfamiliar number, number four, Jason Pierre Paul, who has been around now for 13 seasons, and he was here over the last couple, and he was very excited talking to him the other day about coming back and saying, you let me go? Am I right? Yeah. I got something for you. Yeah. That's what he was implying. Again. Quickly. Godwin. Same play. Gain of eight. takes it to the 22. And that time Brady obviously just has the freedom. He even got a hand signal to Godwin after he went in motion. And look, once he sees that he's got this kind of cushion, just fire it out there. Bort the play and get the ball out there to Godwin, who is, again, very dangerous. By the way, when you look at their run stats, this is basically a run play in Tampa Bay's offense. So the numbers up front when it comes to running the ball, a little distorted when it comes to how Tampa attacks on that edge on the perimeter quickly like that. Second and two. To the outside. That's caught there. Perryman. The one-time Raven takes it to the 10. I'll tell you something. You know, Brady's 45 years old. In a couple of games this year, he's looked like he's 55. Now he looks like he's 25. Found the youth, man. How about the quick twitch here and how quickly he gets the ball out looking like a shortstop in his old days. I guess he was a catcher in baseball in his old days, but still he gets the ball out quickly. And, again, they're attacking that slot area of this Ravens defense. And it's not so much just the completion. It's what the receivers that time, Perriman, are doing after the catch. Make them tackle. Put the ball at the 10. First and goal. A little behind the receiver, and he pays the price that time. Rashad White, the rookie out of Arizona State, tackle there by A.J. Klein. So Brady threw it behind him, and he pays the price. Ravens said enough. Enough of these quick throws. We've got to make some tackles. By the way, that's been an area too many missed tackles. They're fourth in the NFL, and it's kind of been a trouble spot for them. See, now that they're down in the red area, let's see what Julio Jones, maybe. Mike Evans and Godwin get so much attention. Julio Jones, who's not been in the lineup, is back. He's off to the right in motion here for Brady. Two-thirds of the time. Ravens have a good one with a TD. Inside the 20, Brady to the end zone, and Evans can't get there. In the corner, incomplete, making it third down and 12 with a half minute to go in the opening quarter. Trips there to the field and just picking on the rookie, Damarian Williams, just trying to find that soft spot right behind that coverage that was a little bit tight on Julio, gave him the window, not able to connect there in the corner. Bruce Arians have been here. Lefwich was going to plays. Foles keeps Lefwich. Sends the calls in. It's third down and 12 now. Brady dances, throws. Too high and incomplete. The coverage is good. Contended for Cade Otten. The tight end on his fourth down. They'll settle for three. It's good tight coverage through the middle of that defense, which has been a problem for the Ravens earlier. But here's Julio Jones against Marcus Peters, a matchup that we want to see. See, he has some help there with Chuck Clark coming over. But Brady all along trying to get the ball to the rookie, Kate Otten, who's taken away. But another rookie, Kyle Hamilton, out of Notre Dame. Suckup is in his 14th season. 31-yard attempt. Kamarda to hold it. And that kick is good. From Houston. Camarda to kick off. And it bounds through the end zone. So the Ravens, when you have Lamar Jackson, you can do a lot of different things. So the offensive personnel groupings, two running backs, two or more, 64% of the time. The NFL average is 13%. Three wides and one tight, 9%. The rest of the league, 62%. So you talk about preparing when you're the defense for a different style. Yeah. That's the situation here. Yeah, we were talking earlier about how most defenses now, they prepare for spread attacks, a 4-2-5, a 3-3-5, I'm just getting more defensive backs on the field. That is not the defensive playbook when you get ready for the Ravens and these tight ends, and you throw in Ricard. He's another tight end, even though he's considered a fullback. When you talk about Jackson, you're talking about a running back as well as a quarterback. Fired, and that's incomplete. Over the middle, intended there for Isaiah Lightley. He knows what to do with the football, doesn't he? Moving around, finding a speed. When Lamar goes to scramble, he has a way of working to get open. And he caught a lot of balls at Coastal Carolina in their offense. Take a long look at it. Clearly. Pretty clear about us. Yeah. But what do we know? Tucker now for the point after. and for the first time since early in the game it's 17 to 10 Baltimore on top with five seconds to play in the third let's take another look at the at the rookie working to get open and how Lamar Jackson challenges a defense, even if you take away his primary, O'Shea right there. So instead he keeps the play alive. And likely, unlikely hero tonight steps up again to make a play with Mark Andrews, their go-to tight end down, showing what he can do. I like your word play. That's good. I've been hanging out with you for a while. Look at this. I'll teach you some words. I know you will. Man, 80 is fun to watch. Mark Andrews is the first one to tell him. That's it, man. That's it. Now, of course, the big question is the Ravens have had a lead in the fourth quarter every game. They just couldn't close the door on three of them. I'm sure that's been the focus and the talk, and will be at the end of this third quarter. And some big-time meltdowns, especially against Miami. That was crazy. And they almost melted down against Cleveland last week, too. Brady has not gone two games without a TD pass since 2006. Blanked in Carolina. And not a tonight. And on the cusp of a potential three-game losing streak. It's all kinds of crazy stuff for him tonight. In addition to setting the all-time record for most career sacks. From the 25. Godwin. Breaks a tackle. Picks a four. It'll be second and six. On second and six. Caught. And that will net a first down here for Godwin. out of the 36-yard line. That's where Brady had some success, was throwing the ball underneath. Patrick Queen, the last play in the third quarter, coming in to make a play and starts to lower his head there. right Jake line and Malik Harrison also minus Josh Bynes in addition to Queen at least for the moment Brady has that knockdown knockdown at the line of scrimmage Roderick Washington that's it second down and ten it's the second time we've seen him be able to climb the ladder and get involved in batting a ball down. This defensive line, I'll tell you, without Calais Campbell, I really wonder, I think you and I both wondered how would they hold up without their leader up front, but they have come together as a group, played very good football. Campbell known for swatting him down, so of course it's JPP through his career and a Washington getting into the mix. Second and ten. Brady going deep and caught by Evans. Contested catch. Beautiful grab. 12-yard line over Marlon Humphrey. Exactly what the Bucs needed right now. 51 yards. Good against good. Mike Evans, who's known for his ability to go downfield. Brady just to be safe. Uses his eyes to move that safety. Now he's got one-on-one. Gets the ball thrown to the inside. Away from the defender, Marlon Humphrey, who's as fast as any corner you're going to go up against. And that's what the fans wanted to see. This matchup, 13 against 44. Pretty good coverage with the placement of the ball and good job by Evans of securing that ball downfield. He, of course, had the drop last week. Longest play of the season for Brady. Play action. Has time. Throws. And incomplete. Looked like, for the moment, Kyle Rudolph in a tight end. The longtime Viking. Most recently with the Giants. Looked like he had a chance to get it. And he does his best impersonation of Lamar. And his receiver, Julio Jones, is trying to adjust with him. The problem is Chuck Clark adjusted better. Steps right in front. Again, should have had that interception. And that's Kyle Hamilton who goes down. There's Hamilton 14. Friendly fire. His foot maybe got caught underneath of Clark as he was starting to roll to the ground. Brady wanted a defensive hold. Rookie out of Notre Dame, Kyle Hamilton. He was their top draft choice back in May. Good to see him up. I think what Brady was referencing is at the top of the route when Julio Jones was trying to change direction. Clark, as a veteran, see, there's, contact, and then right there grabs onto that jersey. And that's what I think Brady was fired up about. They've got so many big name guys on defense. Clark is a guy who gets a little bit overlooked. He's a great player. Green Dot guy, the leader. Everyone thought with Kyle Hamilton coming in and Marcus Williams coming in that maybe he would be the odd man out, but no, he's become the alpha and the leader in the back end. Third down and goal. Brady. On the run. Caught! Touchdown! Flag is thrown, though. Otten, the tight end for the moment, is in there. But it's against Tampa Bay. That is on Donovan Smith for holding. Yeah, he's one-on-one with Justin Houston and is in pretty good position. It's just near the end of the block. He locks up, holds onto those shoulder pads right in front of the referee. He had great position. No need for that. Brady, in fact, had already stepped up and away from the pressure. But when you grab onto those shoulder pads in front of the official, you're going to get nailed. It's the third and goal now. Back they come to the 16-yard line. Brady dancing shoulder shake throws and that's going to be caught by Jones and that's going to make it fourth down and goal at the three what a job here by Brady I thought he was just going to throw this ball away so fourth and goal I mean it could go for three make it a one possession game but I don't think that's going to happen right here he's about to throw this away Houston almost gets to him, and then he last second locates Jones, and nobody picked up. Going for an old Fournette is back in the game. Godwin is in motion. And Brady, and what do we have here? We have a flag. Fournette left early. He did. This red zone is kind of the Tampa Bay Bucs in a nutshell these last few weeks. offense five yard penalty just self-destructing penalties want to know what affects rhythm it's things like this, it's fourth down and goal from the two and a half yard, three yard line and a false start what does that mean now? it means that instead of going for seven and then you know go for eight and three now you've got to go for three and eight field goal attempt here by Ryan Suckup because of the penalty 26 yard attempt Jake Camarda to hold and you got a whistle right after the play so Duvernay drifts over Now past the 20 And the best run back guy in the league Gives him good field position Out near the 40 yard line Schedule is upcoming So we talked about the Ravens One game in the next 23 days At New Orleans week 9 by Carolina at home Meanwhile Tampa Bay plays the Rams here next week and then versus Seattle, yeah, but not in Tampa. That's in Munich. And then a bye. And then at Cleveland. Tough. Just dealing with the logistics of that, not to mention who they're going up against. Sure. And again, timing and rhythm. Rudolph hasn't played a lot this year. I know he's wanted to be out there, but Brady just puts the ball out just in front a little bit too much. Has Brady He'd forgotten how to throw the ball. Of course not. But he's just trying to figure out the timing with all these new players that are around him. You can see how frustrated he is about it. Rudolph in his 12th year may have lost a step or two. Second and 10. Tom Penanza knocked away at the goal line. Peters, who has the most interceptions of any active player at 32, back to the way to be third and ten. They got away with one here. Peters are going to test Humphrey on one side. Now you go to Marcus Peters. Gets his head turned. And I don't think Mike Evans was expecting the ball at all. You can see, again, not on the same page. Brady throws it one way. Mike Evans runs a different route. Peters almost comes up with a pick. So third and ten. Early fourth. Julio Jones is back in there on the left side Brady under pressure gets away and slides to a stop and gets hit as well at the end of the play and Tom wants to know if that was a personal foul but there's no flag and picking the grass out of his sock fourth down, fourth and nine he slid but the defenders went over top of him especially Geno Stone, the free safety you know this is the last resort when you're 45 years old. You don't want to have to resort to this, but everybody is covered. See 26 coming in. He goes right over top of him. Not six, but 26 right there. Avoids the contact. It's like throwing an egg at the Mona Lisa if you jump on him. You don't want to do that. This is Ryan's suck-up for a 30-yard field goal attempt. They're trying to shave it to four, which he does. with 12.5 to go in regulation as the cannons go off and the Bucs throw it within Duvernay from the goal line special teams have done a nice job the Bucs have tonight wrapping him up 17 yard line this Buccaneers defense led by Devin White They need to play better against this running game from the Ravens. Just surprised to see 45 just turning plays down, getting pushed well off the line of scrimmage. Look at this. I mean, that's Devin White. He's one of the top linebackers in the NFL and is just not having a great night. Todd Bowles letting him know about it. We'll see if they make the right adjustments to try to slow down what we've seen from Jackson and Greg Roman in the running game here. White was the NFC defensive player of the month for September. Start from the 17. Edwards. Edwards to the 40. Guy who missed all of last season. Didn't play until last week at 66 yards in that game and a 64 tonight. Great block by Ricard on the edge right. here, but watch the rookie center against Devin White, who we just talked about. He's got to make a play. He got to get downhill That center says you not getting anywhere near our running back Again blocked 15 yards downfield That the good news Here the bad news right now That Edwards So they work on Gus as we step away Hard to tell which leg the doctors and trainers came out right away. Good to see, as you mentioned, Al, him up and walking off the field. So you're looking at Marlon Humphrey and John Harbaugh talking, but you're going to see more of Kenyon Drake and Justice Hill will take over for now anyway for Edwards and both had played and played pretty well of course you have your best running back and quarterback on top of that no question so so from the 39 now with 1140 left in the fourth Lamar throws on the run hits his man into Bucs territory and that's Isaiah likely having the game of his young life. Of course, he's a rookie, but tonight, gain of 16, and he's now caught six passes for 77 and a touchdown. So, Lamar Jackson, defense, what are you thinking about? You're thinking about we've got to stop him from being able to run the football. The tight end sneaks right behind those linebackers, and that's Lamar Jackson's wheelhouse. You get him out on the edge where he can throw the football on the run, put it out in front. And Fournette is tackled inbounds. We could not get out, and that will take us to the two-minute warning. They have a first down at their own 39-yard line, and they have two time outs. This is his first reception of the game tonight, Fournette. Stay tuned after the game exclusively on Prime Video. Turns 83 today. Oh, beautiful. Yeah. We'll get that out there. She watches everything. Big fan of yours. Light up a cigar after the game for him. There you go. From the 39-yard line. Brady, very deep drop and a long throw downfield and has a man who's open, and that is Jones. And Julio Jones is able to call it in. Meanwhile, personal foul on top of it. Yeah, Tom Brady got hit hard. Defense, 15 yards will be added to the end of the play. automatic first down. Matt Abike got in there instead of letting up. Keep in mind now, he's 45 years old and he gets driven into the ground. I don't know about you. Great catch here by Julio. It was close to... They might take a peek at that. That ball may have hit the ground. I don't know about you, but at 45 to get driven into the ground by a 300-pounder? No thank you. How about at 19? Right. Right. Boy, that ball looked like it may have hit the ground. So the penalty, though, would stand in this particular case. Well, maybe not so. Terry, let's bring you in. Terry McCauley, you've been hanging out for 58 minutes. What are you seeing? I have, Al. He seems to get brief control, but then when the ball hits the ground, he loses control. This is an incomplete pass, which should be reversed. And the penalty for? It will be enforced. It will be enforced. No matter what. Absolutely, from the previous spot. Right, same thing as an incomplete pass. The previous spot was, it was the 39-yard line. So that will bring them into Ravens' territory. They're showing it up on the big screen. Tom Brady's looking up there thinking, come on. Just let me catch one break. Let me catch one break standing out there with Byron Leftwich. Mm-hmm. This is one of those you would think would not take this length of time. Well, the only reason you might think it takes time is if they're going to wave it off and then go back and try to figure out where the initial line of scrimmage was and where the 15 yards needs to be added on after the personal foul. But that's where I think New York can help you out too. Yeah. You would think. It's on Brady tonight. Those two sacks came back to back. Completely controlled the ball prior to it hitting the ground. It is an incomplete pass. The rough in the passer will be in fourth for an automatic first down. Please set the game clock to 155. 155, please. All right, so the original line of scrimmage was the 39. Attack on 15. Moves the ball to the 46. Well, they're walking all the way back. But now they have to walk it up another 15 yards here. And we wouldn't lie to you. You know, John Harbaugh, as I mentioned, turned 60 last month. Third in tenure with the same team. Of course, Bill Belichick on top. And only Mike Tomlin's been with his team longer than John. 60 playing 40, though. Don't you think? I mean, look at him. Yep, yep. He looks like a million bucks out there. Doing a great job. He'll feel a lot better if they hold on to this lead tonight. Brady now on first down. Wide open. This is Miller, and he's trying to get out of bounds, and he does to stop the clock with 149. Second and four. Through their first eight games since Brady's been here, in 20 they won the Super Bowl, 247. Last year, 260. Now, 149. Again, 25th in the league in scoring. Last year, they were second, and Brady goes down again. rushing yardage you can see the difference the change in the scheme in the second half and they're going to add a lot more to that right here inside the 30 yard line drake finally tackled by edwards so the much-traveled kenyan drake with another big run you're going to yards you're going to pull around your left tackle stanley and your rookie center lender bomb to get out in front great blocks by the two big fellas. And then look because of the formation to your left. There's nobody left. Middle linebacker Devin White doesn't get there. He gets picked up and kind of caught up in the wash. And this is a fatigued defense. I want to continue to say that. This scheme that they're defending is wearing them down in this second half. This is Baltimore's 70th play. Under four to go and Jackson Well, balance. They have rushed tonight for 228 yards and thrown for 222, which adds up to 450. That last play, he's trying to do what he's done a lot tonight, just flip it out to the guy that goes in motion, Prochet. And it's covered. McCollum takes it away. So what does he do? Does he throw it away? No. He just is the best athlete on the field. He just lowers his shoulder and wiggles and picks up some positive yards, four yards instead of a throwaway. Good start for Tampa tonight on their first drive, but pretty much all Baltimore since. Second and six to the outside. Keeping his feet, breaking tackles Justice Hill and stays inbounds to boot with the clock. Keep running under three minutes. Yeah, love to see him stay inbounds. Gus Edwards has had a big night. he went out, so Drake and Hill you have fresh legs, you have a tired defense and Justice Hill runs hard, man remember he had the fumble last week that gave the Browns life, he is holding on to that football, and as Al said, he gets down inbound, just short of that first down marker, but those were some live legs for late in the game third and one, pretty much compelling the Bucs to take a time out of it, Ravens pick up the first here they have all of their timeouts, in fact They were able to stuff him. So it's going to be fourth down and one, and they'll take it, or will they? William Golston showing some heart right there, as tired as he is. They do take the timeout, yeah. William Golston, 10 years. Yeah. Been a buck all of those years. Drafted back in 13. Fourth down. So in all likelihood, in this situation, I mean, you've got Tucker coming. It makes it a two-possession game. Mr. Reliable? You think? I'm knocking on wood for the Ravens fans. They're still nervous. Remember, he had one at the end of the half, but he kind of tried to drive it low for that distance, and it got blocked by Patrick O'Connor. I'm the guy that can give a guy a kibosh, trust me. Are you? You've been at it a few years. Collinsworth and I have done that many, many times. Even Madden and I were able to do that. This guy is un-kiboshable, I think. 30-yard attempt. No problem. So the Bucs are going to have two timeouts and the two-minute warning, but they're down by 11. All right, what's coming up the rest of? Which is a big loss for Joe Burrow in that Bengals offense. You look at that AFC North, you look around at Pittsburgh and Cleveland and Cincinnati and Baltimore, I mean, you would think if Ravens stay healthy, they're going to be the frontrunner to win that division. And we talked about their upcoming schedule. They play only one team the rest of the season that right now has a winning record. And that's the Bengals. And that's the last game of the year. Until then, uh-uh. So what can the Bucs do here? We've seen Brady for two decades. Work late game magic. Swings it at the four net And four net Get lit up And takes the hit And fights to get to that goal line and scores Going for two White in the backfield with him Brady Surveying On the move And drop it A flag is down in the end zone. That's odd, and you've got a hold coming up here. And against the Ravens would put the ball at the one-yard line. Patrick Queen. He was trying to stay with the rookie Rashad White out of the backfield. They got Here they have Clark if they wanted to call that hole. They had two different guys they could have called it on, but they got on Queen. Take your pick. Two points. Are you running here? Get the rookie White in the backfield from the one. Godwin moving. Give it to White. No, no, no. He can't. Chuck Clark. Talking about him before he makes the stops. And now you need an onside kick and a touchdown. Chuck Clark makes the tackle. But Justin Houston, inside of him, eats up all of the blocks. And there's no one left there. So definitely give an assist to the 12th year vet. Just to his right. Watch what Houston does. Takes all the tight end and everybody else. And there's Clark saying, thank you very much. Geno Stone gets in there. And like you said, now, instead of an onside and a field goal, Brady's going to have to get the ball back and put it in the end zone if they do. So not very often these days does a team recover an anticipated onside kick. Harbaugh is saying, you've got to send me home with a win. Come on, guys. We've been through this nonsense enough. I mean, last week was they were holding on. At the end of that game with Cleveland, and it took a false start and then a blocked field goal attempt to preserve that win. Now they've got to recover this onside kick. It happens once every 20, as you can see. 5% of the time. So the punter, Camarda, will send it down there. But in the meantime, a timeout is taken by the Ravens. Okay. Chris Wharton is the special teams coach. Making sure his guys are lined up properly. Trying to figure out what they can anticipate. And can the Bucs... infuse some drama bouncing ball taking no problem and that's likely what a game for this guy he's going to hold it like a baby that is great that is so good oh yeah right and just the beginning of what's to come you got to believe in Baltimore instead of letting it take that next tricky hop he just backhands it Brings it in says nighty-night. Yeah, he's had one of those nights man. He'll never forget this one. Yeah He says lullaby and good night to the Bucks You know so we did the preamble to the game With the lead up to the game and you know the Radio guys are talking about it's time to panic. By the way, how do you panic? How does one panic during the season? What do you do? Yeah, call those shows and yell at everybody. I guess you do. Right? Well, Tom Brady, three-game losing streak, first in two decades. Sets the all-time sack record tonight. These guys go to three and five. Everybody in the division is under 500. It might be one of those divisions you might be under 500 and you could win it. It could be. And Washington did that in 2000. Yeah. and almost beat Tampa Bay in the wild card game before the Bucs went on to win the Super Bowl. Anyway, that's why we don't want you to touch that time. Ever. That's right. 27-22. It started out very nicely for the Buccaneers, but did not end that way. And the Rape running it in. And they go 83-9 plays and take a two-possession lead. 15 yards on the touchdown on the third and one. He gets full speed, but watch the block on the inside. Watch Likely come from our left. He has a guy on in the man coverage, so he gets a two for one. Dean follows him. He gets white, and then that creates the running lane after the block by Justice Hill. Again, great, great execution in this second half by this Baltimore Ravens offense. It is fun to watch. Tucker. point number 24 little under 7 to go in regulation in Tampa on this Thursday night Ravens up by 11 defense couldn't do anything and I think all of us are just so used to Brady finding a way out of it that we just assumed whether it's this week or the week after but there's bigger issues in Tom Brady it's what's around Tom Brady as they have these growing pains and they're trying to work out of it together. And the big issue, too, is a work-life balance for him at this point. So, from the 25-yard line, he's used to comebacks. We know that. Does he have one in store tonight? White is the running back. Brady caught by Evans. Steps out of bounds gain of six yards Evans tonight Four catches for 109 Brady obviously has to go fast here Under seven minutes Down a couple possessions Second and three Outside again Caught by White The rookie Picks up the first down Six and a half left in the fourth. Brady 16-29 now. 238 yards. And that's incomplete. That's Julio Jones. Only played in two games this year. The longtime Falcon picked up before the season. Second and ten. Tell JPP got a hand on that ball or not. Or it's just a Yeah, it looks like he did. He just barely got maybe a hand on that to knock that away from Julio. To the outside again. Evans will come up a little bit short of the first down. So now you're third and two right here. You're almost in a four down situation. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. and they don't have to worry about a fourth down here because White's going to pick up the first and take it into Ravens territory there's Goodhart running again by the rookie Godwin had a great start to this game in the slot and what the Ravens have done is get the rookie Williams out and bring the veteran Marlon Humphrey now in there over the slot Humphrey going deep and it's Miller there and his contact and two flags thrown on the play. So Scottie Miller was there, passed a little underthrown, and Brandon Stevens covering on the play, and that'll take the ball all the way down deep into Ravens territory to the consternation of Harbaugh. Ball is underthrown, and it forces the receiver to come back, and Stevens just never locates the football. See, it's so often. Grabs the face mask there. But defensive backs on these underthrown balls, they just lose sight of it. And once you lose sight of an underthrown ball, that receiver works back. It's an easy interference call. 40-yard penalty. First and goal. Pressure coming. Godwin tackled by Peters. Second and goal. We all know that Brady is so familiar with these situations. knows how to deal, knows how to keep his composure and work with incredible urgency. It's just more about the pieces around him. Can he get in sync? More veteran receivers on the left in this formation and the newer, younger receivers to his right, Otten and, of course, Julio Jones, who's a new guy this year. Flushed out. Brady has it batted and incomplete. There was Jones, but there were four white and purple uniforms there. Chuck Clark batted it away, and a Raven is down here. It'll be third down and goal. Chuck Clark should have intercepted this. Brady, again, he's not known for scramble mode, but perfect throw to, again, likely who has stepped up tonight. Really emerged in this past game with Mark Andrews down. That's the definition of a convoy on that play. Everybody going in the same direction. 23 first downs for this team. and staying on his feet picking up about 7 goes Kenyon Drake by the way, Ronnie Stanley haven't talked about him tonight but it's great to see him back absolutely, he had to fight through that ankle surgery from last year had to battle some injuries and really I think just starting to get himself back into shape but again, I can't say it enough about the job Greg Roman does with this offense and how they utilize different formations and use these tight ends stresses this defense. Second and three. Fighting his leg goes Drake for a first down. Delaney makes the tackle with ten minutes to go in the fourth. And just to remind people, this Ravens team that's had the lead in the fourth quarter hasn't really shown their ability to sustain those leads. They've lost three games with a ten-pointer or bigger lead. John Harbaugh, when he met with us this week, echoed how they've been trying to get this team to understand. Listen, we're talented enough to win a lot of games this year, but guys, we have to play 60 minutes, and we have to start owning the fourth quarter. Here they are again with this lead, now under 10 minutes to go and driving. Harbaugh turned 60 last month. I told him, don't fret, it's the new 59 and 7 eighths. The pass is pulled in by Duvernay, and that's a first down. So another good-looking drive by these guys who run 64 plays to Tampa Bay's 43. So, again, watch the linebackers clear out of here because they have to respect the threat of either the quarterback run or the running back. So they clear out, and look at the holes. I mean, they're one step ahead of the defense and how the defense reacts. Great job, again, putting Lamar Jackson in a favorable position to execute there in the play-action game. Keeps it. Jackson. And he'll move to six on that, but a flag is thrown. Very few flags tonight. But this one, with Carl Sheffers to tell us what's cooking. Holding number 42. Offense. 10-yard penalty. And that's Ricard, the fullback, coming in there to hold. And Lamar was already 10, 12 yards downfield. So, Ricardo's 300 pounds, by the way, as a fullback. Gets his right arm locked up around the neck of McCollum. And watch how far Lamar is downfield. There's 42. I mean, he's 5, 10 yards downfield. He's going to step out of bounds. Unnecessary. And you can see his frustration. Yeah, I think he saw. He saw it right away. On his way. It would have been a first down. That was a huge play. They still get the first down, but it could have been bigger. From the 24, Drake. To the 21-yard line, he goes. Started this drive on their own 17-8 plays. I keep referencing this defense. Getting very tired. It's another potential red zone. It's a high red zone right now. Well, time of possession, 33 and a half minutes for the Ravens and 18 minutes for Tampa Bay. Coming up on halfway through the quarter. Second and seven. Jackson buying time. He'll keep it and comes close to picking him a first down before he is pushed out of bounds. by Devin White. Third and one. Linebackers, we've talked about Devin White. Instead of the play-action game, this is just dropping back, trying to read the quarterback's eyes. I thought he might pull the trigger on the left to Josh Oliver. He had him open, but there's the threat. When he doesn't make the throw, you better get there. And that time, just enough by Devin White to push him out of bounds. Six carries, 41 yards, so he's averaging seven yards per carry, which is about his average. Ninth play of the drive coming. First, third down play. DuVernay takes it. Into the end zone he goes. Devin DuVernay. That'll be gay. That's a good coverage downfield. That's what led to the sack. Brady had nowhere to go, including his check down. I mean, this is a well-schooled defense by Mike McDonald in this two-minute situation. This is the coverage, and this is what Brady saw with Godwin on the slot. Good tight coverage there by Peters, taking away the crosser by Mike Evans. Even his check down for net out of the backfield was taken away. So, eventually you can see the double team out of BK works through it, and there's Brady to bring down. And the Bucks have to take another time out here Stopping the clock 1.41, third down and eight Brady fires, caught And that'll be a first down A race up to the line Cade Otten, the rookie, tied in A first down at the 34. Brady already has in play called. Everybody's lined up, ready to go. Underneath, Fournette. Fournette's going to stay in bounds. Keeps the clock rolling. 19-yard line. And now, Tampa Bay elects to use their final timeout. Good job of leveraging the football there by that Ravens defense. Even the rookie, Pepe Williams, forced that back inside. You give up a few more yards, but with that lead, it's all about the clock and making them use that last time out. You know, Mike McDonald, who is here as an assistant coach from 14 to 20, there's that state of the outside, force him back in, and they have Queen and the rest of that defense able to bring him down. But like I said, he was here as an assistant, went to Michigan last year. I think a lot of people thought with Wink Markindale out, heading off to the New York Giants, How would this young former assistant do coming back running this defense? And you've got to say, based on what we've seen so far this year, tonight against Brady, they're in really good shape with him at the helm. Brady to the outside. They still have time. I mean, you could kick the field goal here, but they still have time to try to get it to the end zone and then the onside kick and try to get a field goal. Now that they're out of timeouts, it's either out of bounds or shots into the end zone, so the clock stops or you score. 72 seconds. Second and five. In the pocket. Caught, but Evans is inbounds. That will be a first and goal. Get it up to the line quickly. You can hear him. 7-5, fire, kill that clock. And they do. The 60 ticks. So Byron Lefwich Hold over from the Arians staff Bowles got the job Didn't change the offensive coordinator Meanwhile Lamar Jackson Tonight with 238 Passing yards 45 more on the ground And it's knocked away At the goal line By Hamilton Kyle Hamilton knocking it away. One rookie taking care of the other. So it's third down and goal. How about the length by Hamilton at 6'4"? You said it. Rookie against rookie. Two very talented players. But it's that left arm without getting the right hand in to interfere with the receiver. That is a tremendous length. Brady has that batted at the line of scrimmage. That is Washington again. And it's three knocked down by Washington. So it's fourth and goal. And now, you know, you would think you're going to go for the field goal and then the touchdown on the onside kick. And they need an onside kicker somewhere, but they're leaving the offense out there. Washington 6-2. It's not like he's out there like Calais Campbell, right? He's not a huge guy. Hangs out with Jason Pierre-Paul. Shows him how to do it. So fourth and goal. And Brady trying to keep the game going. and a flag is down for the moment. You have Jones going into the end zone. Julio Jones, but penalties have just killed him down here. The defense lined up offside. They did. Speaking of JPP, that's him. So that's going to make it. 27-22. Got to go for two. And then, of course, the onside kick. Julio works from the far right underneath. And then what you love to see, this guy's been battling through injuries. He lowers that shoulder, knows he's about to get hit.
