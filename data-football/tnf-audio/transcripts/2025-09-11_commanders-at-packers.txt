 A little bit of confusion in the back end of this defense. You've got the safety back there who gets occupied, and that opens up a great seam right there for the quarterback, Jordan Love, to make a great throw. Good job here recognizing that, almost baiting that safety, and then putting the ball right into the seam, vertical seam. And there's Tucker Craft again, his second reception on his drive. Very underrated and talented tight end for this Packers offense. Scored on the first drive against Detroit last week. You know, it's funny. LeFleur keeps getting asked, you know, who's your number one receiver? He says, I could vomit. I've got a whole bunch of guys. And that's not even talking about Kraft, the tight end. Oh, no, not at all. And, you know, you get Jacobs, get Chris Brooks involved. Of course, Christian Watson is down. He's physically unable to perform for a few weeks. So ACL late last year. Hopefully he'll be able to come back. In the meantime, I keep thinking, I told you in a meeting this morning, that Matthew Golden, the rookie out of Texas, eventually could become that kind of guy. He's a difference maker, and see if they get him isolated tonight. He's got great speed. You saw him a lot in college. You were ready to put him in the Hall of Fame at the meeting this morning. Second to nine. Rolling, under pressure, little floating pass intended in a matter of speaking for Kraft. It'll be third down and nine. They went out. Al, you mentioned it earlier. They went out, even though they got to the NFC Championship game, and defensively just retooled the defensive front. Brought in five new defensive linemen. And, you know, there's an off-defense that ranked 30th in the entire NFL in defending the run. So not only are they better and more physical against the run, as you saw there, they're better at getting after the quarterback now because they stay fresh with a deeper front. Adam Peters, GM, put a major premium on the defensive side of the ball. Third down and nine now. First drive bogged down. On fourth down here, it's third and nine. Chased out. Some room to room. Going to get the first down. Yes! Bangs into the defender and picks up an extra five. And the crowd loves it. First and goal. Well, we came into this game thinking that it'd be Jaden Daniels you've got to look out for on these kind of situations. But Jordan Love showing you that he's got the ability, too, to make a defense pay if they play man coverage and they forget to account for him. He gets outside. What I love is the end of this. Instead of getting down, he lowers the shoulder and goes right over Quan Martin to safety. What toughness. And that's a great way to get your offensive lineman and the rest of the offense to respond. Now, a lot of people say get down, but protect yourself. But there he really sent a message to the defense by showing that toughness. Meanwhile, of all things, now you've got the tight end Kraft who's down and needs attention. Let's see what happened to him. Kraft involved in that collision but he's fine. He walks to the sideline has the helmet on. Has to remain out at least for one play Jacobs is the running back on a first and goal from the five yard line Off the fake Pass court. Touchdown Green Bay Romeo Dobs So a drive that Started at their own four-yard line. Goes 96 yards in seven plays. Now look at this formation to the left. And with a back, they're just assuming it's a run. Watch the linebacker come up. And because of that, now you've got a one-on-one matchup. Great release at the line of scrimmage there by Dobbs. But give Matt LaFleur a lot of credit with that formation. That's a run look for this defense, especially down close in the low red zone area. And a good call there early to hit that quick slam for the touchdown. Brandon McManus makes his 89th consecutive extra point. Four and a half to go in the opening quarter. Packed on top seven. Nothing. We're back in 30 seconds. Not even 11 minutes into the game, Green Bay has gained 145 yards and Washington six yards. Yeah, and four of their 16 plays have gone for 10 yards or more. They're having nine yards of play. So they're known for their big playability. And like I said, Jordan Love in his third year as a starter, the pieces around him, they've banked so many reps together. You can see the continuity and the confidence that they play with. And it's been on display here in this first quarter. Yeah, LeFleur is seventh year, as I said before, and he's been the play caller all seven years. As good a feel as anybody in the league at attacking defenses, and he's got the combination of being able to get physical and run downhill. and then, of course, set that play-action game up. The receivers are off to a great start this game. McManus to kick off. And this one will be fielded in the end zone. That's a touchback, which is a good one. He feels comfortable in this setting. By the way, this is like a village. What a great community. If you're a football fan and you've never been here, you need to visit. It's as good of a place for football as there is. But I think, you think about Dallas on the other end of this, you know, trying to lose the city and their fans, what they're dealing with, losing those superstars. Giving the Dallas well-and-druck with Anthony Davis, and they've got Cooper Flagg from the 27-yard line. Daniels hit as he throws. Gain of about eight here. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, Mike has told us he hasn't talked to Luka since before the trade, but he wants to reach out to him, too. He sees the same parallels that we do in their experiences, and he put it quite frankly, saying there's nothing more motivating than when you find out that people you love don't truly believe in you, and they thought less of you. He said there's nothing more motivating. Well, he looked pretty motivated last week. Motivated tonight. Approaching the prime of his career. It was only his fifth season. That's true. Knocking on it. Knocking on the door. Yep. Second down and three after the seven-yard gain. nothing out of the backfield here Eckler tackled by Edgerton Cooper third down with all the talk about Carson some of the things that get lost about this defense are the other pieces and what I think I've seen the growth of is Quay Walker and Edgerton Cooper playing together these two linebackers are no longer hesitating they are getting downhill because there's a better fundamental understanding of this scheme and they play with great length and great communication in the interior of this defense third down and three extra pressure look out passes incomplete that time it was Cooper who came in just talked about him he makes his presence felt again whether it's against the run or his ability to rush the quarterback and again it's not always Micah Parsons here it's just a matter of how do you impact Daniels who's a threat to run the football and can do so many good things you get in there and get into his face. What we talk about throughout the entire first half, especially in a third down situation, the ball has got to come out fast, makes it tough on the quarterback with those corners just sitting on those short routes. Meanwhile, the Packers now in six and a half quarters have allowed only one touchdown, and that was a garbage time touchdown to the Lions on Sunday. Weighs fourth punt of the night. Fielded at the 29-yard line and smothered right away is Deshaun Nixon and a flag. So says Brad Rogers. During the kick, holding. Return team number 36. Half the distance to the goal from the end of the kick. First down. Time out. But having a great night, doing a good job for a guy that's 260 pounds after the reception. 108 receiving yards for him. Pack starts this drive from their own nine-yard line. Jacobs. Heavy workload for him tonight. That's his 16th carry for 61 yards. He's averaging close to four yards per tote. Remember, the two times they have started a drive inside their own 10-yard line, the results, both of them, have been touchdowns. Only two touchdowns of the night. Well, it's not a full moon, but I believe it's, Keith Jackson would call that a possum hunting moon. You hunt possum down there in Nashville, don't you? An old one of our favorite guys of all time, K.J. Jake just picks up a yard. I saw the moon a couple nights ago, and I thought about this game, and I thought, my man's going to pull out. Well, that was three nights ago. Joe Buck wasn't sure it was a full moon. It was close enough. That's, you know, what can I tell you? I look at that thing, and I said, people landed on that thing? The alarm is strong. Oh, my God. What a night and day that was, huh? 1969. I'll look into it. How about that? Great shot. Fabulous shot. Lambeau Field. Third down and eight. Love in the end zone. Just gets it away. And that's on most. Bobby Wagner at 35. Still doing the job. And they dialed it up. They brought a lot. They had a lot of bodies up close to the line of scrimmage. Had seven. Ended up commanders to have to come up being patient. From the 40. Packers already with three first downs on this drive. And you've got to whistle before the snap. Our Chief Justice tonight is Brad Rogers. False start. Offense. Number eight. Five-yard penalty. First down. Pulling on Jacobs. Last week, they really emphasized new season week one against the divisional rival Detroit Lions. They wanted to start fast, and they faced some challenges. I think they ended up converting three third downs on opening drive. But once again tonight, short week, really want to try to be, that's the kind of team they want to be. Attacking, aggressive, they want to get behind the sticks. Let's see what they can do to make up after that false card. Yeah, took the Lions out of the game early, and they never got into it. Love under pressure, going deep into traffic, and incomplete. a little bit out of the reach of Notavian Wicks as he goes for the goal that's second down and 15. We just talked about how they kind of bait you, and then eventually they're going to get the ball downfield, and he is able to get behind the safety. Mikey Sanistro right there. Actually, that's 20, Kwon Martin. He got behind him. His eyes were in the backfield. Middle of the field open. See, Sanistro is back there. Really doesn't find the football until the ball hits the ground, but Love just not able to connect there on that deep shot. So Wicks has been targeted on all three of the passes, second and 15. Hangs in the pocket to the outside. He goes, and that's Romeo Dobbs making the catch there. Same with the tackle, making it third and long, third down and nine. These are these third downs. This will be a big part of the game tonight. You can see Matt LaFleur is fired up down there talking to the officials. Jacobs comes off the field here. Chris Brooks comes in as the third down back. Opening drive of the game for the Packers. Deep, deep drop. Under pressure. Steps up. Leg is thrown. Going deep. And into the corner of the end zone for the touchdown, at least for the moment. That's Reed. And he's hurt. Beats Martin on the play, but the penalty is going to bring it back. Yeah, the rookie right tackle who we talked about. Third down. That's the big question on third down with the movement. Very, very tough with the communication. Well, there's Reed. So you've got a penalty. A touchdown is negated. And the guy, Jaden Reed, has had a left foot fracture playing through it. Yeah, this is what the commanders want to do, is just force him to have to communicate with the right guard there, Sean Ryan. A little bit of a stunt, and it's slow to be picked up there. And by the time he did, you can see the right arm getting around the headgear of Armstrong. So an easy call for the officials, and it gates the touchdown. Had a heck of a catch. Came down. All his weight came down on that shoulder. When Reed gets up, that's the reason for the cheer here, and is able to jog off the field. but favoring that right arm right shoulder so he goes to the bench and it's third down and 19 yeah he really didn't have a chance to protect himself before all his momentum went to the ground with 20 Quan Martin on top of him already dealing with that foot injury that he's playing through at the 55 catches last year, and that's a low number for a team leader. But they spread it around last year, as they have started to do at the outset of this season as well. Third and 19. Four-man rush. Swings it to the outside. Chris Brooks, some room, and Brooks will spin his way to the 32-yard line. So they turned a third and 19 into a fourth and two. And now what? Do you bring in the field goal unit? They're going to go up to the line of scrimmage quickly. Line up to go for it. Make it fourth down and three. Love tells the umpire, get out of the way here. I've got to get the snap. Now he backs up. He looks over toward the bench. And do they go for it on fourth down and three? They will. deep drop again to the outside and that is busted up at the end by the rookie Trey Amos second round pick out of Mississippi Matthew Golden the rookie was the intended receiver so the job the drive to more reservations for flights to San Francisco in February I think Micah Parsons creates a lot of buzz and a lot of attention over the last two weeks but But what he did is he joined a franchise that was heading, obviously, in a great direction with Jordan Love in his third year. This team's really grown up. After the Aaron Rodgers era, they've had to go through some growing pains. This is a year they really feel they can put it all together. You add Parsons into that, and this is a special recipe of who they can be this year. Extra point by McManus is good. That's 90 in a row. Here's the big play on the drive. win the challenge, lead 14-0. Bowl game, and again, the cart comes out to the field. It's Dietrich Wise. Eight years in New England, comes over to Washington. Gets hit from behind on the extra point. And his ninth year in the league, one of the big pre-Asian pickups has a Super Bowl ring, and here's what took place. Yeah, he's able to jump and get penetration, but the right side of that offensive line, it's their protection team. They just fall back with the push and right there. See all the weight came down on him. And, of course, the commanders knew right away. Everybody was taking a knee. There's the entire team right there. Bobby Wagner, the heart and soul of that defense. 35 years old. He's seen it all. We'll be back. Wise is in his first year with this team, but almost everybody on the team came up to hug him, pat him on the helmet, pat him on the shoulders. He gets carted off. He's already made his mark with this team, and then a salute to the fans and back to his team as well. Only wish him the best at this point. Every single teammate touched him, gave him their best wishes. every coach, everybody. And the look of a man right there who knows what's ahead. So McManus to kick off. Seven and a half to play in the first half. 14 to nothing. Green Bay in a game that has been totally dominated. If you're just tuning in, the Packers have 243 total yards. And the command is of 23. McManus sends this one down Returnable from the 5 yard line Luke McCaffrey Christian's younger brother Takes it to the 30 yard line Will the terminal list return That's what you got to do up here Hey but Micah Parsons been in most of the night on 3rd down And here he is coming in on 1st and 10 Coming from the right side of the defense Ball handed off And the 7th round pick Out of 3 schools Jacory Kroski Merrick picks up about 5 Well he came on in training camp And the fact he was so good I think it helped facilitate Brian Robinson's trade to San Francisco Yeah no doubt about it You can see their first 3 possessions Daniels rolling Throwing Juggled and finally caught by McLaurin Boy that was dangerous Looked like maybe an interception coming. Nixon hit him. First down. Good job there. Daniels keeping his eyes downfield. And Commanders fans have been waiting to see how long will it take for Daniels and McLaurin who had the hold in. They lost their timing. And, of course, last week we didn't see much. That time, great effort by 17 to bring that one in. Now you've got Brandon Coleman, the left guard, who got shaken up. Well, I don't know what we expected coming into the game, but certainly out of Washington's offense, we expected a hell of a lot more, didn't we? Yeah, I mean, obviously we thought we would see two offenses against two great defenses, see a close game. Now, the one thing about Jaden Daniels and the style of offense of Cliff Kingsbury, if they can put a drive together and get back into it, they're one of those offenses that can ignite at any moment, kind of like turn that switch, But right now, it's just nothing they've been able to do. And it's because they're losing that battle at the line of scrimmage. Going to halftime, down 14-7. After the way this feels? That's a victory. Yeah, no doubt. Right. So, timeout taken here as they still work on Brandon Coleman. Meanwhile, Love, so far, 11 out of 15. He's already thrown for 199 yards as Coleman goes to the sideline. Chris Paul. Nope, not out of the NBA. The other Chris Paul takes her spot. Speaking of the NBA, we'll have the NBA on Prime Video next month. In the pass rush against Parsons, that's five yards going the wrong way. Five-yard penalty, second down. Tunsil is no stranger to that call. League high 12 full starts last season. At the clock, the 59 seconds, it'll start on my ready. that's a grizzled veteran and still he's got to worry about getting that head start to get into pass throw most veterans are grizzled aren't they second and ten from the 46 underneath some blocking there and it's Nebo Samuel who thought would play a bigger part in the game and maybe in the second half but for Samuel he gets into the action here third and four 40 seconds all three timeouts yeah they're going to milk it until they have to take a timeout they're not leaving Green Bay anytime if possible Devo Samuel can make a play here try to get open find some space out of the slot Daniels looks the other way now he comes back to the right now he's going to go deep down field and it's batted down along the sideline there Ecklund was the intended receiver and Xavier McKinney had a great year last year after coming over from the Giants. Backs the way fourth down. The get-off, I think, is one of the things. There's many things and many attributes that Parsons has, but look at that get-off. That's why guys like Tunsil want to get that head start to try to get back before he's able to go by him. The time they move the pocket to try to give him some time, and there he's again smiling over Parsons like, I'm getting close, I'm getting close. Well, here's Gay, who's going to try a 58-yard field goal. Last one was good from 51, and Gay's kick this time is no good. So it leaves 14 seconds on the clock, and gives Green Bay a chance from midfield to try to get into field goal range, or better. Now the operation there looked pretty good. Good snap, good hold. Just pulled it a bit there, had the distance. So there's the Packer bench going no good. We got, well, you got all three timeouts. You're going to get to use all three with 14 seconds. But you're in midfield, and you're not that far away. You know, these days, especially with McManus, who's been terrific from field goal range. There's definitely an opportunity here, especially with the way that Love and his receivers have been playing. They've got a ton of yards after the catch. In fact, 119 yards already after the catch. See what they can do here. Deep drop. Throw on the sideline. That's going to be holed in. And out of bounds goes on Tavian Wicks. Who doesn't have to really run to the huddle because his clock stopped with him going OB. Eight seconds now in a 14-yard gain. Just really good, comfortable rhythm there by Jordan Love, who got pressured and just kind of felt it, no problem. Moved a bit to his right in the pocket, got his feet under him, and threw an absolute dime right where it needed to be to be able to get out of bounds. If they don't gain a yard here, you're looking at about a 55-yard field goal attempt. And Jacobs will try to move him closer, and he does, and he'll take the timeout here. So Josh Jacobs taking it down to the 31-yard line. Timeout taken. McManus has had a really good career, 12th year in the league, most of the time, of course, with Denver. You'll love this. This gives you an idea about Josh Jacobs. Just the awareness, right? Talk about his leadership, accountability. In case the coaches aren't on top of it, there he is down, making sure the timeout is made. So Matt Worsuch will snap it. Daniel Whelan will hold it. McManus and Worsuch, I think, are the only guys on this roster over 30. 48-yard attempt is off the upright. No good. Oh, to John Madden. Doink. That is the sound it makes. Commanders to get the ball. McManus sends it down to the 7. This is Debo Samuel. Samuel breaks loose. Not past the 40. Into Greenberry territory. and that's exactly what Washington was looking for to start the second half. Meanwhile, Kaylee with LaFleur. As Washington won the toss, they have deferred. Matt Gay descended skyward. And off we go from Lambeau Field with a run back. So the new rules on the kickoff have created a lot more run backs, a lot more excitement. And to the 29-yard line goes Savion Williams, the rookie out of TCU. So up front as Jordan Love takes over, a record of 9-6 last year, 25 TD passes, and those 11 interceptions, almost all of them came earlier in the year. Missed two games with a knee injury. Malik Willis came in and won them both. We'll talk about that offensive line in a second, which has been restructured because of injuries coming into the game tonight. Start from the 28-yard line. And begin with a run over the right side. Josh Jacobs picks up about four. Kirk, here is the restructured offensive line. Yeah, you see that this is a big concern with the injuries. Anthony Belton, rookie, making obviously his first career start. Rookie out of North Carolina State. Big, good size, but he's going up against a defensive front. They had a great game last week against the New York Giants, So communication will be key on that right side, especially with the movement that Dan Quinn and this defense likes to use with a lot of twists and a lot of stunts up front. Second and six. Aaron Banks and Zach Cobb would normally be the starters. Contact made at the line of scrimmage, and then Jacobs is able to pick up a couple. Two carries for him on the first two plays. It'll be third down and four on the opening drive. Yeah, Jordan Love in his third year taking over, he shared with us this week about how much he appreciated an opportunity to sit his first three years behind the Hall of Famer, eventual Hall of Famer, Aaron Rodgers, and he learned so much. And, you know, even last week, you could just see a guy that's in command, the players around him, many of them have grown up with him over these last three years. So when they get into these third downs, there's a real extension from Matt LaFleur out to Jordan Love. Third down, long three. Wicks in motion. First pass to the outside, and that's caught by Wicks. so the man in motion holds it in tackled by Lattimore first down you'll see a lot of pre-snap movement Matt LaFleur's offense good job here of moving you see 13 on the left he's going to move Wicks over man to man but look at the depth that he's able to get because of the soft coverage because of the movement pre-snap Lattimore had to move had to stay with Wicks gave him about a 7 or 8 yard cushion an easy pitch and catch there for Love on the first down He spreads it around, does love. Last week, 10 different receivers in the win over Detroit. Play action. Open. Wicks again. Back to back. Another first down. Tackled again by Lattimore. Again, you see a movement here. They're going to try to test the communication. This time, the commanders don't run with the motion. They're waiting to just kind of sit back. They've been a little bit soft here in their coverage early. early and again it's very easy to be able to hit these these throws they're trying to force the commanders here early he's in rhythm nice easy throw first down force these commanders defensive backfield to have to come up and they can go by him motion again this time through the middle Josh Jacobs Jacobs since 2019 came up with the Raiders but he is second in almost every important rushing category eclipsed only by Derrick Henry. He is a perfect fit in my mind for this offense with Matt LaFleur. What they like to do is downhill running, be physical, and then set up play action and take shots downfield. You think about the weather and as the weather changes, he is a perfect fit. We saw that last year and that will continue this year for this offense. He'll have a big year. Brooks and Jacob is both in the back. You saw 300 carries last year, but play fake and then the pass is incomplete over the middle. Try to get it in to Dobbs, and a flag is thrown. Dobbs won one of those ten receivers last week. The only guy who caught as many as three. Lattimore, I think, is the guy who's going to get flagged here. Yeah, right at the top of the route. Good move to the inside by Dobbs. Little handsy here. Early then watch right there. Grabs a hold of the jersey, gets the hip. No question. That's a good call by the officials. So Latterwar tonight has given up two completions and been flagged for interference. That's right. He's had better starts. He's had better starts. Yeah, you almost feel like this is an offense that wants to get the ball downfield, but the commanders are sitting back a little bit here on this opening drive. Eventually, they're going to get the ball downfield. They're just kind of baiting the offense. Number 85, five-yard penalty. First down. He really meant life-changing. Here was the greeting between the two of them before the game. That tells you everything. Yeah, no doubt. Dan Quinn, of course, he coached the Legion of Boom with Richard Sherman and company in Seattle. Won one Super Bowl, lost the other, and then for him, the 28-3 loss to New England when they were up 23 in the Super Bowl. First and 25. Love fires open inside the 20. We go to the tight end. Kraft. So it was first and 25. They're still shy here. 19-yard game makes it second down and six. And there's again Kraft. This is like a form of a Tampa 2 where you get two safeties dropped. You get a linebacker drops through the middle. And now you open up a crease right there because the middle linebacker had to follow that vertical threat. and a good job of being patient there by Jordan Love. They've been able to attack these vertical seams with a tight end, making this defense pay for it. Good. We're 19. I can't get it. I can't get it. I can't get it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. In a tight formation on second and six Give it to the big man Jacobs And that going to be the first down After that holding call, they had a first and 25 that they were able to overcome now and get that first down. Really trying to wear down this commander's defense. It's already trailing 14-3. Now really trying to lean on them with not just the ability to throw the football, but also running the ball with Jacobs. They're averaging 8.5 yards per play. This is play number 41. Pressured. Looking downfield. Throwing and throws it away to make a second down and goal. so Jordan Love you know it's interesting because you see somebody like McCarthy the other night or Daniels last year starting right away as they start their careers he of course like Aaron Rodgers behind Brett Favre had to wait those three years and he said it was a great experience to play three years behind Aaron Rodgers I think each quarterback every story is different but I love the fact that he turned that into a positive and said man what an opportunity to learn from one of the best to ever do it. And, you know, by the time I was ready in my fourth year, it was my turn and I was ready to go. Second and goal. Here goes Jacobs to the outside, trying to bust a tackle, but they stop him at third and goal. Quan Martin is there for the hit. He said he learned little things like the preparation and the intensity of film study and just really grew. And by the time he got the keys, he was really in a great spot. Other guys, you know, like Jaden Daniels, He walks in as a rookie and gets to the NFC Championship. So each set of circumstances can be different, but it's definitely paying off for him now in his third year as a starter. A lot of guys wouldn't handle it that way as a first-round draft choice. But Rodgers had to go through that too. Huge third down here for both teams. Third and goal at the four. Strips to the left. Looks that way. Has to escape. And this one he throws away. So they needed to hold him to a field goal, and that's what they've done. Right before the ball was snapped, Matt LaFleur, he must have seen something he didn't like. He was trying to get the officials' attention. He got up, trying to get a timeout, trying to get anybody's attention to no avail. Ball was snapped right after that. Pretty good vertical jump. Not bad at all. No. Not Olympic quality, what can I tell you? 22-yard field goal attempt for McManus. Well, then puts it down, and that kick is good by not much. But that makes it Green Bay 7-2. Two superstars like that in their prime. Can't pick a one from the goal line. Devo Samuel will run it out. 27-yard line. We were talking to Parsons the other day. You know, it's one thing to get acclimated to the play on the field. We said, what about off the field? He said, well, they gave me a big truck. I got an Airbnb, and I'm eating at Texas Roadhouse. He told us he weighs 248, wants to get to 240. I said, he ain't going to get into Texas Roadhouse. Better find a vegan place. He said, you know, growing up in Harrisburg, boy, they're going to challenge this. They should. Yeah, crowd sees it. LaFleur sees it. LaFleur will throw the challenge flag. Proud loves it. What an effort by Heath. Tremendous. Kind of a special teams guy with tremendous speed. But that time, the awareness on that left sideline to come down with it. Green Bay to challenge him in the field with an empathy path. Find that if this is expedited or not. So that would be good for an excess of probably 40 yards on the pass. How good a look is this? After review, the woman on the field, it's a completed catch. Yeah. First down. So instead of second and 10, that is good for 37 yards. Nice expedited review there by the crew. You can see it pretty quickly just on that first look. But how about Heath? If you get Jaden Reed goes down, so you're wondering, where's the depth here? Who's going to step up? Is it going to be Sabian Williams? Is it going to be Malik Heath? Boy, Heath taking advantage of an opportunity. That's how you get more reps and more chances. Great play. Remember, their only touchdown drive was a 96-yard drive and points of looking to go over 90 again here. 10.45 to halftime. with Wicks in motion inside handoff Jacobs for a yard or two still fighting his way it'll be second down this is a veteran team they picked up some new pieces but this is where you'd like to see this game is so lopsided even though it's only 7-0 it feels a lot worse and it's where Bobby Wagner and some of the leaders of this team really got to start to to rally the troops and get them to, whether it's a turnover or a stop, somebody's got to make a play here to change the complexion of this football game. It feels like the 24-0 at this point. He threw in the three yards to 23. Open, over the middle, first down and a lot more to the 25-yard line goes Romeo Dobbs. He wants to hear it, and he does. Marshawn Lattimore, now you brought him up earlier in the opening drive. And here, you know, you've got a crossing route. He's got to be able to work through traffic. He gets depth. He drops instead of going with Dobbs. And so Dobbs has a head start on that low crosser. And you see not only does he get a slow start, but then he's got to work through traffic to get over there. So good job with the eyes and recognizing that once again by Jordan Love. Lattimore, two penalties last week. Picked him up last year, midseason from New Orleans. Handoff here. Nothing doing. Over the left side. Josh Jacobs out there by Javon Kinlaw. Another one of the guys picked up in the offseason. Boy, if he's healthy, he's terrific. Yeah, he was dominant last week, really. The entire front was dominant last week against the Giants. And it made us start to talk this week about, boy, that's the Kinlaw that we've all expected to see, if he could just stay healthy in his sixth year out of South Carolina with the Jets a year ago. At that time, he was able to shed that block and get into the backfield. Great play. Before that, with the 49ers, second down on 11. From the Washington 24. Off the fake. Pass to the outside. Busting a tackle. Kraft. Does it again. What a night he's had. Got away from Will Harris. Gain a 17 first and goal. Got man-to-man coverage. and when you're able to shake a tackle against a safety, you've got a lot of room. And again, Kraft is in line. They can flex him out. He blocks. That time he gets off a three, and because of the man-to-man coverage, he has a lot of room to be able to pick up more yards after this reception. Great job again by the big fella, 85. 6'5", 259, third year out of South Dakota State. Eight minutes left in the hand. Give it to Jacobs Takes it to the one Josh Jacobs Full workload tonight Has already now carried the ball Nine, make it ten times for 32 yards This is such a A balanced offense Give it to him again And into the end zone he goes Touchdown Packers So they've had a 96-yard drive and a 92-yard drive to go up by two scores. I think some more Packer fans are level to make a promo in here. They appreciate that. They certainly do. So first down now, only the second commander's first out of the game. To the outside he goes and diving unable to come up with it. Tended for McLaurin is Carrington Valentine. Second of 10. What a bat on that left side of the offense with Tunsell who came over this year from Houston. The better left tackles. Looked a little bit inside, which you'd never want to do, against Micah Parsons. As Parsons affecting, making, just his presence makes Daniels aware of him, forces the ball out early. And, you know, the Packers know it's hard to get the ball downfield. They jump those underneath routes expecting the ball to come out quick. Second and ten in the pocket. That's caught. And can he get the first down a little shy? Noah Brown. Of course, Brown will go into Commander's lore as the guy who holds in that insane pass to beat Chicago at the end of the game last year. And that really ignited their season. It was the end of the Bears. It really got the commanders going. Here's this tempo again. Go no huddle. Third down and one. Can they pick up the first? Yes, they can. The seventh round rookie. Jacory Krosti Merritt, who we'll call Bill from now on, or JCM. Again, what do the Packers want to do? They want to play a lot of zone coverage. They want to put a shell on the defense. They want to force the commanders to have to run the football or throw the football underneath and get yards after the catch. So far, unable to do that. Third and eight. Looking towards Samuel. Doesn't go there. He's going to take off, and the man will let this team in rushing. Last year takes it to the 33. Edren Cooper makes the stop. There's Jeff Halfley, the defensive coordinator, who is doing a great job in his second year. You can see the players are much more comfortable in understanding the scheme. He understands the players. He has an ability to be very creative, disguise coverages. Of course, it helps having one come over from Dallas, but already a defense that has a lot of pieces to be able to put together one of the top defenses in this league. Second and five. Play clock at two. pressure passes incomplete to the outside intended for Brown Nixon makes the stop you tell me that anybody in America was happier than Jeff Halfley when that trade was made no no he was ecstatic and this again Nixon sitting on the short routes they know the ball is very tough to get look at him he's not losing any ground and it allows him to come up and knock the ball away again one of the beauties of having this kind of pass rush not just Parsons but the whole group is it's very hard on a quarterback to sit back there comfortably and wait for the deeper route. So, again, allows that secondary to just sit and jump on those underneath routes. And Daniels is 8 out of 12 for only 43 yards. About 3 1⁄2 yards per pass. Hangs in the pocket. Deep downfield and incomplete. Intended for Terry McLaurin. Covered there by Nate Hobbs, who's been injured. And he was a question mark coming into the game. but there he is, free agent from the Raiders. Fourth down. So they rush four. They spy this time with Quay Walker, and then they play man-to-man. And it's great to see Nate Hobbs back in the lineup. You know, he's been dealing with some injuries in camp, had a knee injury, but to see him back in that nickel spot allows him to be able to play man-to-man on third-down situations. 51-yard attempt for Matt Gay to try to put him on the board. and a 51-yard kick in the NFL these days is almost a chip shot. Of course it's good. They get three. Green Bay 14, Washington 3. Four and a half to go. Hockey season's on the horizon. Gay to kick off right now. 4.27 to go. Matt Gay, who just kicked a 51-yarder. Savion Williams and Emmanuel Wilson are back to receive. It'll be run back here by Emmanuel Wilson from the one-yard line. And he gets popped up at the 20. Of course, the stadium named after Curly Lambeau, but he spent two years coaching Washington. Savion Williams to the outside. And Emmanuel scores six rushing touchdowns. Big-oh, six receiving touchdowns at TCU with a nice game here off a Kraft block. And there's that spin series, a little bit of confusion, misdirection. You don't know who has the football. Watch the quarterbacks. Parsons in this environment, they're going to have to chip to help him out. We've seen on third down, Parsons line up in the inside. That time at last third down, he was on the outside and went right by Connerly. Connerly, rookie, 29th overall pick first round out of Oregon. Play action. Has time, and then the pass is errant and incomplete. threw it behind. Jacory Crosby-Merrick, seventh round draft choice, has a crazy college career at Alabama State, New Mexico, and Arizona. We can get into that later. He goes by the name of Bill, and we can also call him JCM. It's just Bill. Yeah. Just straight up Bill. That time, by the way, Colby Wooden, who had a great game last week, 96. He came off the field here. He knocked that ball down. What a great game he had last week. But here we go with Micah Parsons. third down and nine this time coverage is good and the pass is also good but dropped along the sidelines Noah Brown had it couldn't hold on Nixon covering on the play it's fourth down I think the Packers may have gotten away with a hold there to top the route by Nixon Noah Brown I think was able to beat him. He's got a nice job of working him. Watch he works a little bit outside. Stems it. Contact there. I think the Packers caught a break. That was a lot of contact there when he tried to come out of that stem. There's Parson. Pretty good job that time of holding up. Tressway already his third punt of the night. And it will be down to about the 8-yard line. Butler wanted a flag. Doesn't get it. 12-24 remaining in the half. And Love and company ready to start this drive from deep in their own territory. Back after this. This game was not just Jordan Love, but the receivers that have really grown up around him over these last three years. And we've seen different opportunities, movement. Wicks has had a great start to this game. See the time that he has to be able to throw the football. Job here with the 12 personnel, two tight ends. Safety fit the underneath. It opened up a nice vertical seam. There's the touchdown pass, the only touchdown of the night to Dobbs. Meanwhile, Love going deep downfield and a little too deep. and that's Matthew Golden, who is, he has Olympic sprinter speed, but couldn't catch up to that one. Boy, does he ever. He's a 4'2", 9 guy, so he can go by about anybody, and the safety was hanging. Green Bay has not taken a shot like this all game. 20 that time, Martin didn't really anticipate that Golden might go by him, and he did just that. So the corner thought he might have some help at center field. He did not because of the speed of Golden. and a little bit more air, and that's a 96-yard touchdown. Not the last time in his career that Golden will get behind the defense, take the top off. Meanwhile, a nine-yard gain here for Jacobs, third and one. Talked about those receivers. You can see Jordan Love when he has had time tonight, seven to seven. I mean, any quarterback's good when he has time, but that's impressive compared to the pressure, one of four with the one sack and only six yards. and commanders knew they had to disrupt the timing between Love and these receivers. That's a good look at next-gen stats powered by AWS. Third and one now from the 17. Jacobs gets the first tackle there by Will Harris. So at this point in the game, the Green Bay Packers have a total of eight first downs, and the commanders have one. It's been a pretty dominating performance here in this first half And a lot of it's been at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball That time on third and short Good job of picking up the slant there by Dan Quinn's defense Especially the tight end Tucker Craft Who had the key block to open that up for that first down Boy, Craft's a good looking tight end I'll say Great year last year Going deep again down the sideline. And the catch is not made inbounds. Even though Malik Heath was there. Hold it in, but on the chalk. It was Sehner still that time. Came in, put the pressure on from the secondary. Can he stay in? Interesting. Boy, that left foot, that might be a catch. The right foot's down. Look at the left foot. It's got possession. Got two backup offensive linemen in. And another hot start for this offense. what's been the key to their execution? Well, everybody's doing their job. And so, you know, unfortunately, we should have more points than we do right now. We've had a couple critical errors. We've had too many penalties, and we can't do that to ourselves. Your defense is heading back on the field. What do you need to do to continue to limit one of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the league? Yeah, we've got to take it one play at a time like they've been doing. I think our guys have been locked in. They're flying to the football, and it's going to take that relentless energy and effort in the second half. Thanks, man. Well, Washington starts with a 50-yard run back from Samuel, and then the first play is a 5-yard gain for Jokori Kroski Merritt. The rookie, second down and five. That's what the commanders needed, a big return here. They start in plus territory. It's been a tough first half. We just talked about the job that this Green Bay defense has done against DQ's offense. They've only played man coverage twice, just playing a ton of zone and winning up front at the line of scrimmage. Second and six. Throws it at the feet of the rookie that time. Incomplete. Lucas Van Ness forced that issue. Third and six. It's been interesting to see Micah Parsons really embrace Lucas Van Ness, who he ended up taking his job. And maybe 90's hanging out with one here. Look at this kid off here by 90. I mean, that's a running start. And they really feel that now that he, you know, coming out of Iowa, his third year as a first-rounder, starting to kind of turn it loose. Power at great length. Now the good thing about with Parsons here, they can move 90 inside as well to get them both on the field together in passing situations like this right here. Played about half the snaps last week. Probably in that area tonight. Third down and six now from the 40-yard line. And two for seven in that first half on third down. Again, a lot of zone and a lot of just trusting their front four to be able to get the pressure. And Corral, Daniels not let him get out and escape to scramble for the first down. Ben McLaurin and Samuel stacked on the left side. Packers showed blitz for a second. Back off. Will they come again? Send the extra man. Jaden Daniels under pressure at the 31-yard line. Over the middle. Completes the pass to Zach Ertz, the longtime tight end, 13 years in the National Football League. Had the big touchdown in Philadelphia's Super Bowl win back in 17. You saw Lagarty look back and say, we got pressure here, we got pressure. Good job. The delayed blitz there ends up not really impacting Jaden Daniels. Good job of waiting, waiting, eyes, and then he's able to work through his progressions with enough time there on third down. To get that first. Keep his penetration for Washington tonight. To the 31 of the Packers. Inside handoff here. And we call him Bill Krosky-Merry. That's his nickname. He loves it. That's what the guys call him. Clay Walker makes the stop. They'd love to see him get going. Without Brian Robinson, Eckler is really more of a third down back at this stage of his career in his ninth year. So the rookie out of Arizona really has got to become a guy that can take some of the pressure off this passing game and off at Jaden Daniels. He only played one game in Arizona. Started in Alabama State. Went to New Mexico. Crazy eligibility issue. Pass to the outside. He's caught. He's trying to fight his way for a little extra yards. Look at all the white shirts there. Yeah, they are. Yeah, Debo Samuel. They're wearing their white winter warning jerseys tonight, which is so funny. I mean, I've done a lot of night games in this stadium. It's the first time I actually see perfect football weather. First time? Well, because this is ideal. Usually you're here and it's 30 degrees. Yeah, December is January. It's 64 degrees. Perfect. Absolutely. Now the third down here for Daniels, third and three. the rookie with Parsons now on the right side of the offense play clock at one just get it off step it up like chrome normally in the area of holding and the Parsons gets in there just circled the matchup knowing that thought they may try to help him but they left him on an island against Micah Parsons tough on anybody but especially a rookie can left tackle in college gets way too far to the outside because of the respect he had for his speed it's almost like Micah Parsons expected that he thought he might be jumping so he worked back to the inside and all the rookie could do is grab onto him for the hold still didn't really matter. So the penalty is declined to make it fourth down. Pushed it back ten more yards, but they've chosen this option, which gives Washington the chance to kick a 52-yard field goal. So Matt Gay, who's already banged in one from 51, and this one... Another doink. No good. D-O-I-N-K. There it is in week two. But we're there for the following week. Miami at Buffalo on Thursday night football. Parsons congratulating the boys up front. As Love goes back to pass and throws deep over the middle. And it's caught at the 35-yard line. Sends that pass into Luke Musgrave. The backup tight end gets saluted with a chant of Luke for 23 yards. He gets an opportunity here. Watch him work on this route. He'll work to the middle. Really impact the safety before he works back to the outside. A little move, a little hesitation move. Able to get great separation. In fact, turn the safety completely around. It seems like every time the commanders sit back with one high safety look, Love has time to throw. He's now 10 of 12, over 200 yards passing against that look. Six different receivers that Love has hit tonight. He gets hit as he throws and throws it out of bounds. That time Quan Martin came in from the secondary to force it, second and ten. You really feel that Joe Witt is going to have to continue to mix it up. Usually, based on what they did last week, they're confident enough that they think they can get home with just being able to rely on their front. But that's not been the case tonight with the wise injury. I think you'll see Joe Wake continue to try to look for ways to try to disrupt his timing. Because when Love's sitting back there against zone with his feet under him, he's able to put the ball right where he wants to. It's funny, we see so many quarterbacks talking about throwing off-platform. Love focuses trying to throw on-platform. Inside Gibb, big hole, exploited by Jacobs. Should be a first down. See where they spot it. Jean-Baptiste making the tackle. official comes in looks at the down judge put it on the line first down and that is a ball that was intended to bounce as an outside zone but he has such good vision and feel for that he's so patient the runner was short of the line of the game ah there you go so originally it's called the first down they called that from upstairs and say he's short which means instead of a first and 10 Third. Yeah, he's going to make it third, I think third and one. Yeah, a little inside of about a yard. But, yeah, great vision as always from Jacobson. He's able to get north and south so tough with his leverage. It's down low. Off the fake, wide open to the outside. And once again he goes to Luke Musgrave. But a chanting loop. St. Roussel makes the tackle. First out of the 17-yard line. Yeah, short week. You just wonder, this defense is tired, fatigued. Right now, just the middle fatigue. There's just a late reaction there from Sanisville with a tight end that ends up going over in motion. Made it very easy. Third and very, very short. Maybe expecting a run, but getting over it. Second or third time, we've seen the secondary react pretty slowly to emotion. On the ground again. Jacobs burrows his way. With a flag down. 14-yard line. Brad Rogers signals it's against Green Bay, so that'll push him back. Holding. Offense. Number 75. 10-yard penalty. First down. You know, you see Matt LaFleur. LaFleur actually coached under Dan Quinn for two years as we look at the play again with Ryan. At Atlanta. Right. And interesting what he said about. Fabulous. He said it was life-changing to see a different style and environment. Couldn't have spoken more highly about Dan Quinn, as a lot of people do. He talked about having fun, but at the same time being focused and just being able to find that right balance. It can be tricky to do. And for him to say life-changing as a coach, I think it says it all. Yeah. First and 20 and another flag here. A rare thing these days. Luke McCaffrey there as we take a look now at Daniels. Again, Heisman Trophy winner. LSU two years ago. Offensive Rookie of the Year last year. Got him into the playoffs. And rookie quarterback record for rushing. He leads in rushing last year. He's off to a great start this year. He's already on a pace for like 1,000 yards rushing. Only because of the one game last week he had 60-some yards. You know, to think that he led him in rushing, and there's a good look at Micah Parsons. So probably about 30 to 40 snaps tonight. We'll see how the game goes. But they don't even really try to emphasize him every week in running. They try to take care of him. A lot of it can be him just creating and making plays. The new kickoff rule brings the ball out to the 35 after the touchback. Come up in the pistol this time. And the ball handed off, and the tackle's made right away. Lucas Van Ness, two yards back of the line of scrimmage, second down. It's talked about how they like to run him from time to time. This is old school college football zone read. He collapses down and takes the back. Quarterback's got to pull that and get around the corner. That time it's a missed read there by Jaden Daniels on that zone read. Second and 11. again Eckler bangs his way former Charger 9th year in the league out of Western State in Colorado 3rd and 7 I know it's only a week and a quarter but with Micah Parsons coming into Lambeau how much fun is it to watch this defense with Jeff Halfley the scheme that they have and you add him into it this is as much energy on a defense that we've seen in the NFL in that first week. Last week, and it's continuing tonight. You wear number one, you're easy to spot, too. It's better than you know, 53, 58, or whatever. You know where he is. So does Daniels. Third and seven. Deep drop. Throws underneath. Caught. Can he get the first down? No, a yard shy. They go to Eckler again. And the flag is down. That time it was Parsons rushing. Now, this is either going to be a holding call or roughing. It's either holding on the right guard who's trying to keep Parsons out. Yeah, it is. They got him. They twisted him. Pull that on Allegretti. They walk up everybody, but they'll stunt him and work him around. Allegretti's on the right side. And, you know, the quickness, the speed, the power, he gets leverage on him. And now there the hold right there So he impacts the game It not just the sacks It making this offensive line communicate twist and movement power and speed And he gets a holding call to push him back even further on third down. Third and 17. From the 28 to the outside, nothing happening there either. Jalen Lane makes the grab. Bullard takes him down. fourth down. The beauty of this defense is they love to play shell defense, meaning there's a lot of zone. They want to keep the ball in front of you, and when you have the front that they have and how quickly they collapse on the quarterback, it's very easy to be able to keep the secondary and the linebackers' eyes on the quarterback and play zone and let that defensive front work. Dressway in for his second punt. Keyshawn Nixon back to receive. last punt was a beauty he pinned Green Bay at the 4 but they went all the way down the field another good kick Nixon Fields brings it back out to the 25 yard line with 2 minutes oh I was not doing this not chasing a Super Bowl I was working with Lee Corser the great Lee who just retired what were you doing at 27? were you doing the Reds? I was doing the Cincinnati Reds we won the pennant If you were the team announcing you got through the World Series on NBC with Kirk Gowdy and Tony Gubick. Remember that. All downhill from there, baby. Thank you, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan. What year was that? 1972. Lost the World Series in seventh to Oakland. Yeah. We covered the earth here on Thursday night. Yeah. Well, that led them to 75-76. You missed out on that. I was gone. Marty Brenneman took over. I went to the Giants for the money. What else is new? Oh, man. Meanwhile, second down and four here at the 30-yard line. Love backs up. Under pressure. Down he goes at the 19-yard line. Pressure is on. Dancing away that time is Jacob Martin. Picked him up from Chicago. One of those free agents that Washington worked through the offseason to pick up and supplement that defensive front. And look how we all got in from the blind side. And it is Von Miller keeping up with where he's been. You know, he was a Buffalo course last year and 36 years old, 15th year. Good to see him out there and involved. Still has that bend. Still one of the great pass rushers the NFL has ever had. Third and 14. Love to the outside. Some room here, but not enough to pick up the first down for Chris Brooks. Third-year guy out of Miami. Saner still makes the tackle. Fourth down. So the combination of Jacob Martin, Von Miller coming up with that big sack on second down. Getting them behind the sticks here. So defense does their job. Got to get this offense going for the commanders. Tough defense they're facing tonight. Well, fourth and four. But right now what they're doing is just waiting for the clock to run out. Then the quarter trying to get them to jump, but they won't. And they'll take us to triple zeros. And the end of quarter number one in Green Bay, Wisconsin. on this Thursday night with the Green Bay Packers leading Washington 7-0. Back after these messages. Dominated all of the football talk for about a good month anyway. Would he sign? Would he not sign? Would he trade him? And of course, he winds up getting traded as Wayland starts the fourth, the second quarter with a putt. The flag is down. Fielded at the 16-yard line. Nice run back to the 30 by Jalen Lane, the rookie out of Virginia Tech. I think they may get a face mask here on the Packers. Definitely against the Packers there backing up. Brad Rogers has had a fairly busy first 15 minutes plus. Personal foul, face mask, even though his mic is dead. Personal foul, face mask, kicking team. Number 59, 15-yard penalty added on to the end of the run. It's first down, Washington. Hopper right there with the right hand, right in front of the punter there. Just got his hand up into the face mask, pulled him down. See if Jayden Daniels can take advantage of starting this drive close to midfield. It's been a slow start for the commanders. They're looking for some continuity. To say the least, they've run six plays for 11 yards. Fewest since week 17 in the first quarter for this squad. Wouldn't be surprised to see it try to get some tempo going, try to get this aggressive defense on its heels. Chikori Krosky-Merritt is in the game. We'll talk about him in a second here. The pass is caught. Debo Samuel, they picked up from San Francisco. Tackled there by Bullard. It'll be second down and ten. Bullard does a great job of getting off the blocks, but what stood out last week in the Lions game is what you're seeing tonight. 20, watch him work, does a good job of getting off the blocks, but look at all of the white jerseys. These guys fly to the football. Great deal of energy, show up with bad intentions. Daniels is 4 of 4 but for 9 yards swings it out here Debo and he's out of bounds and you know for the offensive coordinator Cliff Kingsbury this is like a shiny new toy if Debo can go back to what he was like 2 or 3 years ago in San Francisco he looked great last week did a good job moving him around had that big touchdown run on the jet sweep and he is another piece of what he does is Terry McLaurin needs some help. And I think as Jaden Daniels and McLaurin continue to work out their timing, it's nice to have Debo Samuel in there. Third down and three. Eckler back into the backfield here. Four-man rush. Pass is fired and is caught above the grass, and it is by McLaurin, Terry McLaurin. How would you like to be a rookie right tackle who played left tackle your entire college career at Oregon. And now you're matched up on the right side as a right tackle. And, boy, he got lucky. Got the ball out quickly before Micah Parsons got in there. There's the tempo. Quick snap here. Daniels is going to take off. Go next to nowhere. Again, Parsons is in on that place. Great circle route that time. Second and nine. Connerly on that right side was a big thing we wanted to keep an eye on, just being a rookie in any game, let alone going up against Micah Park. Action here. He hands it to 83 on his right, then fakes to 8 up through the middle, enough to hold the defense. Good blocks on the outside. Saw 18 Malik Heath, who had a great catch earlier, and, of course, Tucker Kraft getting around 85 with a nice block as well. It's a big series for the commander's defense. Defer, get the ball to start the second half, and right now to sit here at 14-3, the way this game has gone, they're pretty fortunate. Absolutely. Second down and 2. To the outside, Jacobs. Nice little move there. Flag is thrown. Holding. Offense, number 86. Three-yard penalty. John Fitzpatrick. Number two or three, tight end. So that moves the ball back. The Curly Lambeau thing was so interesting. How many people knew that? Josh Harris came by. I talked to him before the game. the owner of the Washington Commanders, he didn't know it. Everybody knows Lombardi coached both teams. The only reason I know it, I took a walk last night, and I stopped by the statues, and I saw both those statues, and I read up on them. He was born in 1898, coached in the 20s and 30s and 40s, and then, again, like you said, went over to the Commanders. By the way, how about the job Josh Harris and Adam Peters have done? Oh, yeah. Third year, he's on the team. NFC Championship. Came off the Snyder regime, so they loved him right off the bat. Second down and 12. A little floater there, and it's caught. And taken down to the 25-yard line is Chris Brooks. Bobby Wagner making the stop there. Bobby Wagner, of course, he played in Seattle. Dan Quinn was his defensive coordinator in the two Super Bowls that Seattle played back-to-back. 13 and 14. Here's a man who played almost every snap last season, every snap last week, and every snap so far tonight. It's incredible to think. We asked him about his workout regimen. He just talked about basically everything. I mean, you name it, he is doing it to try to keep his body right. Very intentional about keeping healthy and being able to play at the level that he plays at in his 14th year at 35 years of age. Huge third down. Third and 11. Love. Under pressure. Gets out. Signals downfield. Going for it all. And incomplete. A little jostling going on downfield. Pass a little underthrown. Dobbs and Lattimore, fourth and 11. I'll tell you, you go back to that holding by John Fitzpatrick. If he doesn't have that holding call, that is a first down with a ball at about the 40-yard line and plenty of time to be able to get points on the board. So the commanders catch a break with that hold. They push them back, and now they get off the field. So instead of potentially 17-3, who knows, 21-3, not only do they get the stop, now they get the ball back, still 2.14 to go, and still a chance to put points on the board themselves. Daniel Whalen second punt of the night first went for 54 yards backing up feeling it at the 19 yard line Lane feeling Lane to the 44 yard line only had two attempts over 10 yards through the air final play before the two minute warning first down from the 43 yard line rush 4 Daniels keeping it get out of bounds a little shy of the first down and second and 2 takes us to the 2 minute warning with 1.55 to go in the half and the Packers up by 11 at Lambeau it's second down and 2 for the commanders from the 49 yard line and pulling ahead as enough of the first down here is Austin Eckler so they have all three timeouts I mean if they go in 14-6 or 14-10 yeah what an opportunity here and really just a great example of just kind of weathering a storm about as everything that could have gone wrong has but here they are 14-3 with the ball across midfield inside handoff here about five yards for Eckler here second down keep that clock running still with a backup guard Chris Paul on the on the left side Sam Cosby by the way not starting he's he's on pop as well so he playing with two backup guards second and five stoppage here I mean the perfect scenario for these guys would be to score and leave Green Bay with no time on the clock. He's got to get the ball to start the second half. That's right. And again, not to just continue to beat this to death, but it's the little things that can impact the game. Tunsell's a vet. He's got the crowd noise, and look who's across from him. He wants to get that early start. Boggs down. Ten and a half to go in the opening quarter. And Washington to get the ball. Terrell Davis comes to mind. Sharp would be another guy. Commanders have the ball. after the failed fourth down attack. Micah Parsons in the game to start it out. Played 29 snaps on Sunday. Pass goes to the outside. That's taken in by Austin Eckler. There was a little bit of confusion there. When Green Bay went fast, you could see the official stand over the ball. And the reason is Inar Barty thought that there was a field goal attempt. So a miscommunication. He ran out onto the field thinking it was a field goal. And then they pulled him back off. and that's what caused the official to stand over the ball, and they couldn't go as fast as they wanted. Matt is pretty good at chewing people out, isn't he? Oh, yeah. Second down and seven. Daniels loves to go to his right from takeoff, which he tries to do here, but can't. Gets stripped up near the line of scrimmage by Devontae Wyatt. Well, like most quarterbacks, you see Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen, of course, Jaden Daniels. A lot of guys like to step up and then go to their right, the right-handed quarterback. Well, Green Bay obviously knows that. They are determined to try to make him work fit to his left, away from that right side, and then be able to rally to the football. So that is kind of a cat-and-mouse game tonight between the Green Bay defense, Jeff Halfley, the coordinator, against this Washington offense, and the quarterback. Third down and eight. Daniels in traffic. Eckler makes the catch. Stopped a little short of the first down, so it's a very rapid three and out for Washington. Evan Williams in on the stop. And Micah Parsons. Remember, last week they weren't even sure he would play. Maybe he played a little bit. He played half the snaps. Yeah, and he'll move all over the place. Here he is lined up there on the defense, his right side, trying to get him matched up there in the inside against a guard. Pretty good job of holding him out. The best thing there, you'll see a quick smile. You'll see that a lot from Jayden Daniels. Good job of confusing Daniels there, making him hold the ball by moving the coverage from pre-snap to post-snap. Got confused there on that third down. Dressway in his 12th year. Took a shot last week, but he is okay. Matthew Goldman, the number one draft choice, the speedy rookie, He backs up, calls it in at the 5 and gets taken down. Great tackle and great coverage and then a little bit extra at the end. Percy Butler with great coverage. And a flag thrown. Brad Rogers will sort this one out. That was a 55-yard punt. And Golden lost another 2 on the return. And check out the extracurricular stuff. Because that's what they're talking about. There's no foul on the play. Yeah, they got tangled up. Called incidental. 8-0-8 to go in the quarter. Still no score at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. On this Thursday night. Fine. Their second position. Darion Kennard now comes into play right tackle in place of Anthony Belkin, the rookie to take him out after one series. Off the fake. Open. Making the catch along the sideline. Getting the first down to go to the tight end. Coming off a great season. Tough man to wrestle down. Tucker Craft picks up the first. Kaylee, what you got? Guys, earlier we saw Packers receiver Jaden Greed come down hard on his right shoulder. He immediately grabbed that collarbone area afterward. On top of it, that fractured foot as well. See the minus number 11, likely for the rest of the game, is Josh Jacobs. Picks up five up to the 24-yard line. Yeah, you'll see Savion Williams, the rookie out of TCU, probably get some more opportunities. You saw him on special teams earlier. Remember that right side was Zach Tom down. We saw Anthony Belton, the rookie, 71. Now you've got Kennard. He picked him up in a trade from Philadelphia. He had one career start last year, Week 18 in Philly, so he's now on that right side as well. And I'm missing Zach Tom, who's started every game over the last two years since they picked him up. On second and six, good protection. Pass wide open, making the catch, and getting into Washington territory. Tucker Kraft pulls his way down to the 20-yard line. So Kramp gets a first down and then gets a huge play here for 57 yards to the Washington 20. Watch the linebackers react to Josh Jacobs. You have two tight ends here. Four and two touchdowns when he had no pressure. Guy has four incompletions all season when teams don't affect him and they allow him to sit back there with his base. You better affect number 10 or they're going to put up a lot of points on you. No question. Packers go to 2-0. Commanders go to one and one. Each team with that mini bye right now. Love and Kinlaw right there. The two QBs right there. And both teams in action in ten days. 27-18. Fireworks going off at Lambeau Field. on this Thursday night. Talk to you next week from the Hall of Fame. Now has his name up on the facade here. There it was. Played from 1988 to 1994. We were talking before, Matt LaFleur congratulating him. You don't see that many guys after seven years. I mean, you have to have a terrific seven-year span as, let's say, Terrell Davis to get into the Hall of Fame. Made the most of those years. What a great player. Yep. From Brother Shannon. Yep. Commander Starr from the 35-yard line. Up to the 40. Trying to back his way for a first down here is Ertz. A little bit short. Second and long. Second and short, actually. Second and two. So for the Commanders, it was anything but a commanding win last week, but they beat the Giants. Fairly handling. We'll have to clean up it tonight. Not so good to the 45-yard line this time. It's Terry McLaurin. We'll have to clean up a few things before their next game. Yeah, no doubt about it. Terry McLaurin is, you know, he and Jaden Daniels, Jaden telling us, with not a whole lot of time to get some work in, they've had to work a lot after practice to try to sharpen up their timing. That's fired, and that's broken up as well. And once again, Keishon Nixon, seventh-year man in South Carolina, breaks it up. And I think ideally, as this defense grows, with Nate Hobbs coming back, Valentine on one side, Nixon on the other, Hobbs can play to the inside. Throwing Evan Williams at safety, Xavier McKinney, Javon Bullard, they have six guys that they really feel good about. And it's great to see Nate Hobbs back to help this defense. Second and ten. Pressure again. All night long in his face. That time it's Wyatt. He's had a nice night as well. Devontae Wyatt, third down and ten. The Commanders next week, which is a week from Sunday, so get a mini-bye. They meet Vegas. The Raiders go to Washington. And then they go to Atlanta. That's the next two games. Third and ten. Over the middle. Samuel and Debo is able to get a first down to the 32-yard line. They used him there on Micah Parsons at the line of scrimmage, just able to chip. Well, it looks like Eckler is down. He's away from the ball. Yeah, so Eckler, and a ding coming into the season, that'll enable... I was going to say, with Eckler, there just wasn't any contact. You know, he's trying to cut, and when he makes a cut, he just starts to... something... And he knew it. You know, when any... yeah. Oh, baby. Oh, yeah. It's almost worse than a contact injury in some cases, too, you know? Yep. Give it away. Several really good years with the Chargers. Good guy came out of Western State in Colorado, small school. His mother put him on bucking Broncos as a kid. That's why he has such fantastic balance. And it'll assist him off. Tough one here. Kroski Merritt has kind of ascended into the top spot. Anyway, Jeremy McNichols would be the next guy up in the backfield. You already saw, obviously, Dietrich Blythe went down with a tough injury for this commander's team. And now Eckler goes down. You see by his facial expressions, he's super concerned with what that might be. First down now. Daniels flushed out again. Open inside the 20-yard line is Luke McCaffrey. He'll run the ball back to the middle. Time is of the essence here for this team, down by three possessions. First down at the 14. Yeah, good job there by McCaffrey. He recognized his quarterback scrambling towards him, went to the space downfield and able to recognize it and make the throw. And McCaffrey has pretty good bloodlines. Christian is his brother, his father, Ed. Very good player with Denver and a coach. And a mom. Oh, yeah. Probably the best athlete in the family. Right. Just bringing five. Von Miller ended up coming off the edge late. But like you said, Bobby Wagner able to come free. They loaded up the left side of that offensive line, freeing up Wagner to be able to flush Jordan Love out. And the defense does their job. Three and out. Get off the field. That's exactly what Dan Quinn told Kaylee walking off at halftime. We've got to do a better job on third down. That time they did. They're just kind of like a boxer. They're just kind of hanging in there. They've got to get this offense going. They can get within a possession. Get off the ropes. Whalen's punt. Fielded. 39-yard line. Jalen Lane gets popped at the 50-yard line. Hangs onto it. Lane, a rookie out of Virginia Tech. Three and a half remaining in the third at Lambeau Field in the third tonight. 17-3 Green Bay. The bend has a lot to do with how they're able to get around that corner. Yeah, that's a great demo. How tough it is to block a guy at that angle. As Washington takes over the 50-yard line, good protection for Daniels down the sideline and incomplete. Coverage good. Brown, the intended receiver, covered there by Nixon, second and 10. They went empty here, just trying to spread this defense out. Somebody's got to be able to make a play. A little stuttering go this time from Noah Brown. It's been tough to get the ball downfield. We haven't seen very many shots here. In phase, pretty good coverage. The only thing, Nixon has a hard time locating the ball. That's why Brown actually had a chance there by jumping, maybe affected his eyes there to make that catch. Second and ten. Fired over the middle. That's complete. Trying to back his way into a first down is Ertz. Tackled there by Cooper, two yards shy, third and a deuce. Yeah, another veteran. We keep talking about the comparisons from the youngest team to the oldest team. Zach Ertz still getting it done, 34 years old, 13th year, out of Stanford, sets up a third and one. third about a yard and a half and trying to burrow his way for that first down is Eckler tackled by Evan Williams the officials come in they spot it initially a little bit short there it is a little short of the first down boy what a job of getting penetration everybody wondered in that trade with Kenny Clark moving. What would this defense, or look at this defense, what they're going to be able to do. That time, Carl Brooks able to penetrate and affected that play. Fourth and inches. Can the commanders convert? Boy, I'm telling you, it wasn't easy. But Austin Eckler is able to pick up those inches and a few more. I mean, that took a second, third, and fourth effort from Eckler because of the push that Green Bay got. Look at that job of getting back, pushing the center back into the backfield. But Eckler, who's met in the backfield, continued to do that leg drive for the first. Daniels wrapped up, going down. Rashawn Gary. and a guy who should really have a big-time season, especially with Parsons now on that defensive front. Yeah, he's going to get so many more opportunities and one-on-one chances in pass pro, and this is, again, against this poor rookie who's just being educated tonight in the NFL. Again, give him some, cut him a little slack, a guy that played left tackle in college and tonight on the road against this defense, going against Gary and Parsons, been tough for him. Gary had one and a half last week, two and a half now on the season. Passes over the middle. At the 38-yard line, the ball walker was saying it came out. That's Ertz. The receiver. It's a nice weapon to be able to have. At least give you a chance after that sack to be able to get some positive yards and a chance here now. Remember, this is probably in an area now you're down 14, getting near the end of the third quarter. They've got to be thinking about a couple of plays here to get this first down. A little more than a half a minute to go in the third. Third down, seven. Spread it out. Pressure. Extra man coming. Pass down the sideline. He's short and incomplete. McLaurin is there. He's double covered on the play. Cooper that time again, forcing it. Coming up the middle, fourth down. Jeff Halfley is doing such a good job of mixing up these looks. At times it's just rushing four. Other times are you bringing... Grandfather is Dave Sima, who is a great Olympic spreader. Those are the bloodlines. You got it. You can see Jaden wave him off. He goes down. Kind of lands awkwardly. And did not want to come out of this game. Second and nine. It's caught inside the ten by Terry McLaurin. Third down. That's all they would need. Well, that's everybody's fear. Anytime a quarterback takes off to scramble, it's that being dropped, kind of brought down from behind with the weight of that defender potentially coming down on top of that lower part of his leg. But he got up. Nice throw in the next play. He's rushed seven times, but for only 17 yards. To the end zone, too high. No good. Fourth down. Flag is thrown, however. There it is on the four-yard line. You can tell by Matt's expressions. Defense, number 29. Half the distance to the goal. Automatic. First down. That's on McKinney. well that's who Ertz was working on and McKinney tries to he's given up some size but he's got tremendous athletic ability he's just trying to hold on there you can see you know Ertz is able to is a big guy he's able to use his head there to try to use his head as something almost like an anchor to get separation and retaliating McKinney just kind of held on to his shoulder pads and gets called for it it. Green Bay making some substitutions. That's why play is held up as the play clock goes down to five. Still holding it up. First and goal. The play clock expires. And Washington forced to use a timeout. Let's bring Terry McCauley in. We'll have a three-way on camera here. So, Terry, how long can the umpire stay there and hold the playoff in that situation? Well, once the offense declares its package, the defense has a reasonable amount of time to match up. You know, if there's multiple people coming in and out, they get a fair amount of time. That did seem a little excessive that time. It does. But, you know, they do get to match up. Terry, what is reasonable? You know It's really a feel thing And we see him a lot He's got to get in there And they've got to get in and out But again going all the way down the goal line And coming back is going to take some time First and goal that sad side Of Eckler being carted back To the locker room First and goal McNichols is now the back Terry we just wanted to get you in To make sure you got paid down Thanks very much. My pleasure. Send the check. That's Nick Allegretti. We seen a lot of these offensive linemen not just the crowd but again you got to give the Packers defensive front a lot of the credit for how twitchy they are You know Wyatt wouldn play most of the snaps in the interior But the guy you got to keep an eye on when it comes to pass rush and twitch and just speed is 94 Brooks He caused that penalty. Daniels. Surrounded. Carl Brooks. First time he mentioned his name tonight. Got in there. It'll be second down to gold. Once again, the combination of coverage and zone coverage with seven defenders in that tight space down inside a 10-yard line and then rushing four. You take away the receivers, and eventually the pass rush is able to get to and squeeze Jaden Daniels there. There's just no one to throw the football to against that coverage. Three minutes left. second goal here they come pass is caught samuel dives into the end zone so devo is in there to make it a two possession game 27 16 at the moment good job of getting devo samuel the football and and jayden daniels if it's a guy that has tremendous toughness Remember, he got landed on. We thought he might come out. He fights through it to finish his pressure, using a twist up front that time to affect the communication. Made Jane Daniels just have to get rid of the ball, even though there's good coverage downfield. Going for it, down by 14. 22 ticks remaining in the third. Fourth and seven. crowd in full throat Daniels straight drop Daniels throws catch is made flag is thrown Zach Ertz they're going to mark him short right at the top of that route is where the flag came in Nate Hobbs covering on the play and you can tell by LaFleur's reaction with the penalties against defense number 21 Five-yard penalty from the previous five. Automatic. First down. That's Hobbs, who had his knee scoped in August. Was on the injury list, but came back. Starting tonight. Yeah, there's the hold right there. Actually, a couple times there, before he got to the stem to be able to come out of the break, it was contact. Good call by the officials. So they'll pick up the first down there on fourth down to keep this drive alive. And they run the clock. That's eight penalties on Green Bay tonight. Can they get a playoff? They do before the end of the quarter. Daniels, will they keep it? He's trying to, but no room is there. And that will take us to the end of the third, fourth quarter. It is second and ten for Washington. From the Green Bay, 32. Look out, here comes Parsons. still because Parsons got it from behind and then Bullard got it from the front. Once again, Micah Parsons against the rookie. This time they actually try to chip with a back to try to help him out. You see 26 right there. McNichols try to come down but look at him get out. Bang! I mean he's just shot out of a gun. So fast and powerful. The right tackle has no chance. The chip has no chance and a heads up play that time by Daniels that sends it and get out of there as quickly as he can to try to get a few yards. So third down and nine. And now you've got timeout. Granders take a timeout. Their first. This Packers defense, they're able to stay healthy this year. You look across the entire NFL. And I know Micah Parsons is going to get a lot of the attention, and he should. I mean, he's a difference maker and a game wrecker. But when you look at all the pieces they have, and Jeff Halfley in his second year running in this defense, there's a lot to love about what they're doing. The scheme, the way they're able to pressure the quarterback, the way they're able to play zone and keep eyes on the quarterback. They mix in some things to create some confusion up front, confuse the quarterback. Daniels tonight, four scrambles. This guy's elite at scrambling. Four scrambles and 15 yards and no first downs. And we're just starting the fourth quarter. it's because they don't have to play a ton of man. They're able to keep their eyes on him and rally to the football. Third and nine. Parsons trying to break Keely. Almost triple. Kingdom passes caught by McLaurin. A big first down here. Found a soft spot. I'm sorry, Al. They found a soft spot in the zone. He was able to get the ball out again with third down. and Parsons on his right. He knows the ball has got to get out in a hurry. Debo Samuel widens the corner, gives him a nice soft spot there between the corner and the linebacker, and he got it out in a hurry. Nice yards after the catch for the first. Spins away. Protected well. Caught. First down and Moore trying to get to the end zone. Yes, he does. Zach Ertz touchdown. So the commanders with a couple of big conversions, one on fourth, one on third on this drive, 11 plays, 50 yards to make it a one-possession game. What a play design here by Cliff Kingsbury. They use Eckler on a wheel route to take the defender with him. Now watch where Ertz comes after you'll see him wait, wait, patiently wait. Eckler goes down that left sideline, takes the defender, and there he just kind of slips out, makes the guy miss, and then he shows he's still got the wheels to get to the corner for the touchdown. What a play. Yeah, ran right by Quay Walker. Now the extra point to make it 17-10. Matt Gay bangs it through. And so the Commanders somehow... Back goes down, ball's in the air, then it comes back to the football and makes a reception. Jacobs into traffic Jacobs is now carried the ball 19 times 68 yards so it'll be second down and eight Kraft tonight most receiving yards by a Packers tight end in 10 years go back to Richard Rodgers 146 that was the game in which Richard Rodgers caught a 61 yard Hail Mary as time expired from Aaron you called that one? I believe it or not I didn't but I called it the double Hail Mary game in the playoffs against Arizona to the left side. Taking it around, Savion Williams. We talked earlier about the fact that Texas Tech, as a wide receiver, he had six receiving touchdowns. He had six rushing touchdowns, and he threw a pass for a touchdown. Well, with that background, he's here as a Wildcat quarterback, and a nice little changeup here. They put Jordan Love all the way out to the outside and end up using Savion Williams. You see a motion. He's out to the left. Williams comes there behind center. And everyone's thinking, oh, they're probably just going to flip it to him. Instead, he just follows the tackle around that edge and is able to find some space to work. Sorry, Horned Frogs. They called the wrong school for him. He went to TCU. There you go. Taking it now is Matthew Golden. The wide out, the number one pick. He goes to the 10-yard line. Take it down there. Second and short. The floor just kind of holding on to a few things here at the right time. Just in case this game got interesting, which it has at a one-possession game, seen a few wrinkles here that have given him some positive yards and now close to the 10-yard line. Under 10 to play. Under 10. Under 10. Under 10. I can't get it. I can't get it. Keep up. That's my one. Go, go, go. 3-19. That's it. Got it. Jacobs. First and goal. Upcoming. 20th carry of the night. 71 yards. Talk about trying to find ways to finish games, whether you're a defense or an offense. Commanders get within a possession. What's your answer? What kind of drive are you going to be able to put together? And right now, the Packers are really showing what they're all about here. See if they can finish this drive off. From the 8. To the outside. Wide open touchdown. Tucker Graham. Lambeau lead. And it's a two possession game again. He's had a big night tonight. We talked about him all evening. Matt LaFleur with just a really, really good drive as a play caller here. Great execution by Love and company. We just talked about great teams, championship teams answer when you get challenged and come right back with his touchdown. Brandon McManus for the extra point. Third of the night for him, 91 straight. 8.57 to go in the fourth. 24-10. Home team. Touchback 35-yard line. Well, the Green Bay defense has been, we've been talking all night about how they've been able to play zone and get enough of a pass rush, but allow them to keep their eyes on the athletic quarterback and prevent him from creating and making plays. When you play man-to-man coverage, your backs turn to the quarterback. When you play zone, you've got eyes on the quarterback. So they've been able to get pressure with four for the most part tonight in this game and keep that second and third level of the defense with their eyes focused on Jaden Daniels and not let him get out and do much of anything with his legs. The Packers only have to rush for a lookout, huh? If you're on the other side. Oh, yeah. And I feel like you're going to be doing that to a lot of teams this year. Right. From the 35-yard line. Decent pressure, but decent coverage, too. And Jaden takes off for a... ...at the film. He's also going to see a quarterback who he looks to as a leader, kind of the alpha of the team. Goes down at 27-10 with a potential injury. Stays on the field. Keeps finishing the drive. So there's some stuff that he's going to be happy with you can still build on early in the year. Jacobs. Well Mark Teitelman our producer says Let's go down memory lane So let's do that Yeah he painted it It was beautiful Perfect September 11th This is the 24th Commemoration of A terrible day Fourth out Packers to set it skyward and into the end zone. So, right after the game, it will be the Jason Owen beating two quality opponents. I mean, Detroit last year, the number one seed in the NFC. Washington gets to the NFC Championship game. And they go on the road for four in the next five. Daniels sends it out here to Samuel. Nice move from the inside. He's a motivated player. A lot of people thought maybe his career was starting to slow down at San Francisco. and like Micah Parsons is eager to show people that, hey, I still got plenty left. And showing that here in this second half. Second and four. That catch is made there by Ernst, who's had himself a very nice night. Cooper makes the tackle here. That's six catches for Zach. I really thought, you know, they're playing with such urgency right now for obvious reasons. I really thought we might see a little bit more of this kind of, almost what I would call NASCAR tempo to try to slow down this aggressive defense. You know, they didn't really go to this until it got to be a point where the game was out of reach. And they played a lot of that last year, a lot. Yeah, yeah. And it's something that Cliff Kingsbury is very comfortable with in his background, and obviously Jaden Daniels as well, coming out of college at LSU when he won the Heisman. 68 seconds left. batted incomplete Wyatt's doing everything he can to come up with an interception the last play when they fired it into the ground he was trying to get underneath that to come up with an interception that time almost playing like a linebacker he's not really pass rushing he shows rush then he starts to drop showing his athletic ability came close there with that big right paw knocking that one down very underrated interior player for this Packer defense 95. And a real nice night. Third down and 10. Daniel's dancing. That pass is low. That pass is incomplete. You know, everybody's talking about Parsons, of course, who should make Gary even more effective. But a lot of the guys up front, you don't hear about it. Like Colby Wooden, he said, hey, I'm motivated. Everybody said, you know, Clark's gone, so hey, wait a second. We can't stop the run. Yes, we can. That's right. You know, you lose Kenny Clark, a nine-year player for you, and really the face of that defense, a veteran leadership and opens up opportunities with him being in Dallas now. And you're right, Wooden, Wyatt, Brooks, all taking advantage of it. Fourth down, last gasp here. Pass is incomplete. Nothing happened in the field. Again, who put the pressure on? Numero uno. Well, you might as well have one more look at number one. And I think the thing to remember tonight is it's not just the sacks, it's how he impacts the game. And what a great move. Again, last week he goes against Sewell. Tonight he goes against Tunsell. I don't know if he's going to play against better tackles throughout the whole year and still makes his present felt where Dandles has got to get rid of the football or he's going to get sacked by number one. Unbelievable. No training camp. Had a back issue. Funny scene before he and Daniels chatting with each other, both smiling, probably talking about their bank balances. Well, Mike is saying you're still on the rookie contract. Yours is coming. Yeah, he'll be here soon. The postgame show. Maybe Fitzy and the boys can break this down. Jordan Love tonight. 15-17 for 225. Some way within seven points. Like a boxer just hanging around. Right. Right. Look at a win a split decision. Kick. Backing up into the end zone and kneeling down there. So tonight's the white uniforms. Yeah, the white uniforms. You've got a whiteout. I mean, you can count on this crowd at Lamba. They're all going to follow their instructions. Everybody shows up and they're white. They're all dedicated. They know what this is about. Impressive. Look at this. Everybody's in line. Whoa. You know, it's one thing to come in here and it's four degrees. It's 64 degrees. I'm not that impressed right now. That's right. But he's having a little fun. Yeah, I think he is. Yeah, he's having a lot of fun. He's a big fella there. He certainly is. Not the folks having it crowded next to him. What are you doing there? No way. Oh, boy, he's after. He didn't have to. All right, the Packers start this drive from the 35-yard line. Wicks in motion. Off play action. Pass to the outside for Wicks. Reaching out. Bringing it in. Beats Lattimore again as he's done a couple of times tonight. First down. And once again, you go back to really the first play of the game. It was motion from the left to the right. Opportunity to be able to make Lattimore have to move. Gives him a cushion. Able to work with that cushion. Good way to start to drive. A little out cut. First down. In rhythm again. On platform. Feet underneath him. stable base for love six years in the league but only third as a starter first and ten look out dumps it off before it gets hit and it's dropped that time it was Dorrance Armstrong flag is thrown it's going to be defensive holding first down created here because of the hold That was Lattimore. Holding. Defense. Number two. Five-yard penalty. Automatic first down. That is Washington's first penalty of the half. They had to clean it up last week, I think, where they had 12 penalties against the Giants. This is against a rookie. A few times he's been out of phase and have to try to use his veteran awareness to try to create a little cheat code to try to help him out, but he's been caught. Eight times as he joined the team in midseason last year. Dancing. Moves to his left. Incomplete. Coverage was sticky. Romeo Dobbs, the intended receiver. It'll be second down and ten. That time we've seen Lattimore have to work across in motion. This time, watch the communication between Lattimore as he works across. He kind of passes it off, makes sure that they're on the same page with that switch release and forces Jordan Love to have to go from his left back to the middle of the field. So good job of an adjustment there by Joe Witt in this defense. Second down and 10. He's coming. Take it, take it. Yes. Jacobs to the outside. Five-yard run. You know what's interesting to me, Kurt, is that when Lattimore was in New Orleans a couple of years ago, he was almost a shut-down corner. You go from a shut-down corner to a guy you're picking on all night. Yeah, and I think the one thing about him is he's had an ankle, he's had an abdomen, he's had a hammy. You know, you wonder how close is he to being really the guy that he was when you talk about him being one of the elite corners, playing for the Saints year in and year out. His last three years have taken a toll. He's only played 25 games in the last three years combined. Good point, wear and tear. Picks are down here, right? Absolutely, third and six. Extra pressure. Love escapes for the moment. And it's caught along the sideline. And he goes to Kraft, but a flag is thrown on that one as well. I think it's going to be another defensive hold here. So that was a third and six, which is going to wind up as a first and ten after the call. Defense number three. That penalty has declined. The result of the play is a first down. Will Harris. What a job by, once again, Kraft. Keep in mind this guy is 6'5", 260 pounds, and is pretty light on his feet. Recognizes his quarterback, needs some help, comes back. Pickup of about three. Gary put the heat on that time. Second down. Right on cue, right off of that package we just showed you. You just saw it again. Rushing four. Defense able to take away all his options downfield, but playing zone. No shots downfield with a big throw to McLaurin. Just nothing there. And then eventually that front four is able to get to him. Second down and nine. Hand off. Tough three yards. Austin Eckler. Every third down now a big one with a little over eight to play. It'll be third down and four. As you look big picture, not just tonight but the rest of the season, you start to look at the weapons that Jaden Daniels has to throw to. McLaurin, Debo Samuel, Noah Brown, Zach Ertz. Who really can strike fear in a defense? McLaurin, you know, can be that guy. Can Debo Samuel still be that guy tonight? They've just not been able to get anybody to find much of the separation. Yeah, Daniels is throwing for only 119, and that's batted. That's Devontae Wyatt to make it fourth down and four. Clay Walker pressured that time, fourth and four. And there, you know, you get so used to just seeing the four. That time they're able to slip a linebacker with Walker, and nobody picks him up. So, again, affecting the timing and rhythm of Jay Daniels. And here's the play of the game. Washington pushing all of its chips in right now on fourth and four at the 41-yard line. Trying to keep the drive alive. Samuel in motion. Again, pressure. Incomplete. Batted down. They went for the rookie lane, Keyshawn Nixon, having a nice night. Batting it away. Turn it over. That time they brought the blitz. Fourth and short, you know that they're going to be going to that something quick. They go to the quick slant. Good job by Keyshawn Nixon. Gets around the receiver, gets that left hand, Al, that you mentioned, and knocked that ball away. Packers defense does their job. What a salmon fish. You're not. This is low back to pass. Going deep for the kill shot. And it's complete. Intended for which? Second down and ten. Well, this is a team and a franchise that feels that they can do some special things this year. Well, Ed Policy, his dad Harmon was a great executive at San Francisco. Brian Gutekunst, who's done a terrific job here in Green Bay. And they've got something special going on right now. They really do. You've got a head coach that can dial up plays with the best of them. You've got a quarterback now with three years of experience. You've got a lot of players around him that have grown. You've got a defense that could be one of the best in the NFL, if not the best. Well, right now with Jacobs staring there, they're on the cusp of going to 2-0. However, four of their next five games are on the road. At Cleveland, at Dallas, they get a bye. Cincinnati comes here. Then at Arizona, at Pittsburgh. So four or five away from Lambeau. Yeah, I mean, it's obvious it's early. But just if you look at this team and you look at the swagger and the confidence that they're playing with, there's the schedule you just mentioned. How great will that be week four when this team goes down to Dallas? But there's just a lot to like. It just feels like this is a team that has the pieces in the right places. And now you add Micah Parsons to that. They're going to be a tough team to deal with in their division. and throughout the entire NFC. What a great division. It's always fun in the NFC North. But you look now at what J.J. McCarthy is doing with Minnesota after that opening week. Of course, Detroit, even though they beat them week one, they're not going anywhere. Caleb Williams and the Bears and the Pack and what they have, it's going to be a heck of a race. Three playoff teams out of the division last year. Here it's fourth down now. and they are going at least line up to attempt a 56-yard field goal. McManus, meanwhile the clock is running all the way down, so they're in no hurry to get this baby away. Let's take a little bit of time. Timeout. Green Bay. Their first. The 30-second timeout. Also Mike Shanahan of course was very instrumental. Dan Quinn. 56 yard attempt for McManus to make it 17 points. And he does indeed. Bang it through. 640. Instant classic. Touch back here. So at halftime, they honored Sterling Sharp. There he was. Goes into the pro football. Drive off, even though they're down by 17. He still wants to be out there and gets trilled when he threw this football. We'll show you in a second. And then good job of getting to Debo Samuel. Of course, we know what he can do after the catch. Nice job of getting that touchdown. Still fighting by this commander's team. A two-point try here to make it a nine-point game. Of course, you're already thinking ahead to an onside kick, which, as you know, these days has to be declared. Black throne. Pass is fired into the end zone. That's McCaffrey who makes the grab there. The penalty is going to be against the Packers. So that will count. Offside. Defense number 90. That penalty would be enforced on the kickoff. The result of the play is a successful try. Well, we've talked so much about the zone coverage of the Packers. There's man-to-man. Debo Samuel against Evan Williams with a cushion. And, again, they're rushing six. You only have five to protect. That ball's got to get out in a hurry. Just gives Debo Samuel a chance to make a catch against man, and you know what he can do. But look at this. Van Ness, as soon as he throws that football, levels Jaden Daniels. When you're rushing six and you only have five to protect, you know you're going to get hit. And then there's a two-point conversion rolling to his left. Vision backside and eventually finds McCaffrey for that two-point conversion. So Daniels is hoping they can recover an onside kick here, which has to be, as I said before, declared. So 5.4% last year. 3 out of 50. And the new rules, of course, make it so hard. To recover an onside kick with having to declare it before it happens. But, strange things have happened, my friend. It's a weird night. You know, get the possum on the moon. Who knows? Who knows? What was the river? The fox. The fox river. Oh, baby. We cover the earth like Sherwin-Williams. So it has to go 10 yards unless it's touched by the receiving team. Matt Gay comes forward. The bouncing ball is handled at the 48-yard line. And that will come close to writing a finish. So this is Dontavian Wicks who put all the good hands people up there, and that situation secures it. Well, there's a lot of storylines to this one. By the way, this is exactly what you want. I mean, it takes that kind of that roll, and then the big jump. The ball goes up into the air. It gives you at least your cover team a chance to come up with it. But Wicks timed that up perfectly, got down in a hurry. To secure that ball. So 2.52. Washington has one timeout plus the free one at the two-minute warning. Through the middle. To the 50-yard line on Jacob's 22nd carry of the night. Let's go to Kaylee. And guys, as you would expect, after seeing commanders running back Austin Eckler carted off the field after that non-contact injury. The commanders say he is ruled out for this game with an Achilles injury. Yeah, we hope it's just for this game, too. It did not look good. Yeah, any time you see a player go down where there isn't any contact and he makes a cut like that to change direction and reaches down, I think all of us kind of hold our breath, hoping it's not the Achilles. Certainly not a tear. Yeah, hope for the best there. What a night for this defense. Jayden Daniels led all NFL quarterbacks last year with 33 first downs on scrambles. Tonight, seven scrambles, 17 yards. That's it. Did their job in containing him. Second down and eight. Love's going to go down. Well, that at least will keep the clock running. Kind of get a playoff before that two-minute warning Well, you know, it's week two you're gonna lose this football game more than likely if you're the commanders But the greatest thing that you're gonna love to see Dan Quinn's team And I think he said to this on our call about September football. I want to see guys compete I want to see him play hard. I want to see him tackle. I want to see him run to the football I think he's gonna see some things that are disappointing when he looks
