 First nine. Pass number ten. Going deep. Coverage is great. And incomplete. Batted away. Malik Hooker got over there. He had that great battle going on. And there they are. Yakking with each other. Neighbors and Diggs. And he had help over the top from Hooker to bat it away. And we know Neighbors is very, very capable of making huge plays. but this is just a play that's designed. You're going to throw this. When you roll out like this, throw all the way back. But I'll tell you what happened. It's not just digs. It's really good range by Hooker there playing center field and showing how far. He went 20 or 30 yards to be able to get over there, almost came up with a pick. Yeah, he had Alabama covering LSU on that one. Third down at eight. Jones slides left. Fires caught 40-yard line. holding there by neighbors. That's what Booth was covering. What a job here is selling this route downfield, and he gets the young and inexperienced corner to turn, even though it's third down and long. Watch the corner. Because he sells it, he's going to go by him. Once he turns his shoulders, it's over. That's the respect that he has for that speed, the potential to get by him, even though it's third down and long. Surprised he turned to get out, knowing good chance he's going to work back, Try to get to that first down marker. Ladies, wait a minute. With the fullback in there. Look out. Spun down. Flip down. Mozzie Smith takes care of Tyrone Tracy for no gain. Second and ten. Halfway through the second quarter. Dallas on top 14-6. There's a big emphasis from Mike Zimmer this week after the game against Baltimore about doing a better job of getting off blocks and tackling. You know, they came in tonight allowing 5.4 yards of carry. That's dead last in the NFL tonight. Just over two yards of carry. And I think the two things you're seeing, they are getting off blocks. And those linebackers are flying around making a lot of plays. This was a defense that was fifth best in the league last year. Second and ten. Catch is made up at the 42-yard line. Neighbors making the grab right there. Third and long. We go to Kaylee. Well, Micah Parsons was evaluated for a neck injury in the medical tent. The concern, I'm told, was a stinger, which is an irritation of a nerve as it exits the neck. So that helps explain why they needed so many medical professionals in that tent with him to give him this go-ahead to get back on the field. All right. Thank you, Dr. Hartung. Another third down here for the Giants. They're 4-6. You know, considering this pass rush, pretty good start for Daniel Jones in this offense. Singletary back in. Third and eight. Sliding left again. And he caught up at the 50-yard line. Robinson making the catch there. And they're going to mark it a little bit shy of the 50-yard line, about a half yard shy of a first down. Of course, the crowd wants them to go for it. Looks like they will. That time we finally saw Micah Parsons get in. But Daniel Jones is able to avoid him. Made a nice throw. And now here they've got a great shot at picking up this first down in midfield. Heavy on the right. Singletary in the backfield. In trouble. But gets himself out of trouble. And picks up the first down. Got away from Donovan Wilson. Who had him in the backfield. Couldn't secure the tackle. First down New York. They went with three tight ends. Look at this on this side. Three tight ends here. Here's Wilson on the short edge of the left side of the offense right there. We just talked about how they're tackling better. That was a great opportunity to get off of the field. Wilson makes this play right here. But there's what Singletary can bring. 5-7, 2-0-3. Really good contact balance. Spins out of that and picks up that first down. What a sequence there of plays for the Giants, picking up big yards on third down and then picking it up on fourth down and short. Meanwhile, you've got Overshone is over there, and he is slow in getting up. Second-year backer out of Texas, third-round pick in last year's draft, and he'll come out at least for one play. 13 has been all over the field. What an effort there. Maybe some of that out of frustration because he knows that his guy, Wilson, had him in the backfield just trying to strip at that football. That's the thing. Once you have a reputation of being a fumbler, that defense, they are doing anything they can to knock that ball out of there away from Singletary. Isn't that the truth? Remember, years ago, of course, Tiki Barber had that. They said, oh, Daniel Jones was out for the last half of the season trying to get it turned around this year. Meanwhile, the Giants won the toss. They'll defer. So the Cowboys to receive. Greg Joseph to kick off. Graham Gonneau, of course, was hurt a couple of weeks ago. He's still out. Cavante Turpin, number nine, is a top-notch received man, but won't have an opportunity here as it bounds through the end zone. And thus, the Dallas Cowboys. Dak Prescott, now the highest-paid player in the league at $60 million per. He has won his last 12 starts against the Giants. They've killed him. 26 TDs, 6 picks. What the Cowboys have to do this week, or hope to do anyway, is get off to a faster start. They've been down 14-3 early in their last two games and could not recover. Rico Dowdle starts as the running back. We'll see him and Zeke Elliott tonight. And they give it to Dowdle, who cuts it back, and turns it into a 7-yard game to get things underway. Bobby O'Karake making the stop for the Giants. Dak in his ninth year controlling this offense and had a career year last year throwing for over 4,500 yards. He'd be the first one to tell you. In fact, he talked about it after last week's game against Baltimore, how they're anxious to get back on the field. This short week maybe came at the right time. Second and fourth. Keep it on the ground again, but going nowhere. Smothered. Nick McLeod comes up from the secondary to take down Dattle. So it'll be third down and five after a loss of one. Shane Bowen, the new defensive coordinator here for the Giants, really surprised a lot of people last week against Cleveland, dialing up more pressure. And here early back home in a short week, getting his defense right away dialed in against his running game. Put Hunter Lipke in the backfield, flanking Dak. Fake it to him. Prescott on the move. Throws incomplete. And the crowd already roaring. Isaiah Simmons put the pressure on him, so it's a very fast, in a minute and seven seconds, three and out. Third and short, Deontay Banks, who are probably going to be traveling with Lamb a lot tonight, gets physical, understands the down and distance. And not only do you have Banks there, but you could also see O'Kara K. working his way out to the flat to try to help in case it was an inside route from CeeDee Lamb. So they're on third down trying to eliminate him being a factor, and they get off the field. Brian Anger comes in to punt. Amir Smith-Marset back to receive for the Giants. Calls four and makes the fair catch at the 15-yard line. Big Blue starts from there. Here comes Daniel Jones in his sixth year. Number six overall pick in the draft in 19. Last two games, very good. Four TDs, no picks. He's had no success, though. against the Cowboys in his career. See if he can turn it around tonight. Yeah, and remember, he's got athletic ability and ability to run. And one of the things last week the film would show, obviously Lamar Jackson's one of one, but it was just a zone read principles. Wouldn't be surprised with that athletic ability to mix that in early in the game, get his feet on, you know, settled into the game and get his confidence going. Neighbors, top of the screen. Start with a fullback in the lineup here. and a five-yard gain up to the 20-yard line for Devin Singletary. Four years in Buffalo, last year in Houston, and now he's the guy with Saquon Barkley now in Philadelphia. How about that? Brian Dable comes out, as you said, old-school I formation with Johnson, who's a fullback lined up there in front of Singletary. They're going to try to test that doubtless defensive front. It's had a hard time defending the run, dead last after three weeks in the NFL. against the run. Running back is now Tyrone Tracy on the second down and five. Extra protection in the backfield. And here's Tracy going nowhere. Bunched up at the line of scrimmage. So the Cowboys went three and out and the Giants are now faced with a third down on their first possession, third down and five. Yeah, I think the greatest thing there you could see is Overshone, who's in there right now, linebacker, just getting downhill. You know, if you're wondering with Mike Zimmer, mentioned earlier at first year he's here as a defensive coordinator. The big thing he would talk to you about is the interior. Getting off of blocks is important. They've got to do that better. And the linebackers got to be able to get downhill to be able to help out with that offensive line coming off those D-liners. Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Ready! Jones. Back coach of the year. Two years ago. But as the graphics at 7-12 since, second down and 14. Al Michaels for Curb Street. Kaylee Hartung as we start the second quarter. Daniel Jones is 4 for his first 4 for 57 yards. Robinson has caught 3, and Neighbors had that 39-yarder on the first drive. Go empty here. Neighbors in the slot to the left. Jones looks that way fires that way up to the 35 neighbors makes the grab and taken down there by Overshown but he dropped it he dropped it so he remains third down in 14 notice Mike Simmers doing a really good job of rotating here early in this game you see different defensive linemen running on and off the field I think a big issue is the lack of depth they lost so many familiar faces from last year one guy they know they can count on is 11 especially on these third down situations third down and 14 jumping across got a free play coming here the flag down free play down the field and it's picked off but you know what's going to happen that sticks for the moment and comes away with it but the Cowboys know all too well what the story is going to be. That's Carl Lawson who came across the line early. Offside. Defense, number 55. Five-yard penalty. Three-play third down. Good hard count that ends up pulling Lawson over. And like you said, as soon as he saw him right in front of his face, he knew that he had that free play. But, man, he had him. He was behind Diggs. Diggs plays it well like a receiver going back to his early days at Alabama. But if he puts that out in front downfield, that would have potentially been a huge play to Slayton. And of all things, Lawson was activated just today. Still third and ten. Right. Made his presence felt. Third down and nine. Neighbors and Diggs matched up. Top of the screen. Jones looks the other way. Jones comes the other way. That's caught by Robinson. Great move. Needed nine, got 11. Broke away from Eric Kendricks. And for Robinson, already four targets and four catches. I tell you, this kid has got a real chance to complement what neighbors can do. He's had some injuries. He finally had a healthy offseason. And against Kendricks, he can make him miss. But it's the suddenness after making him miss. He still has got another seven yards to go to be able to pick up that first down. We're waiting like that. Play action. Hangs in the pocket. Fires. Caught. Spinning. Slayton. Juggles. Out of bounds at the 25-yard line. This is a great job of picking this blitz up in the backfield right here by Singletary. He's going to come over and pick up this nickel blitz by Lewis. and allows Daniel Jones to be able to get his feet set, step into that throw right over the linebacker, Kendricks, and in rhythm. And again, you love to see another Giants receiver make it a play after the catch. Doing everything they can to keep 11 out of that backfield every single time they throw. 28-yard gain. Go five wide here. Rush four. Jones! And Steve pulled in at the two-yard line. We've got another flag, though. I don't think the Giants were set. They had movement there by the tight end. The rookie, Theo Johnson, was looking out to the outside, not getting his feet set. So Tracy made the grab, but the teams are walking it back up the field. Illegal shift. Offense. There were two players moving at the same time. And number 29 did not reset prior to the snap. Five-yard penalty. Replay first draft. That was Tracy. Yeah, you had the rookie Tracy and the rookie Theo Johnson, a couple rookies looking at each other, making sure that they understood that they were on the right page, looking over at coverage. Once he comes out, it's a running back who played, by the way, receiver in the early part of his college in Iowa. But look at them communicating, looking over here at coverage. And by the time they figured out what was going on, the ball is snapped. They're not set. Out of bounds. As it turned out. So first and 15. On the ground. Time to call that. You boot and you get it out there. And Dallas' eyes are in the backfield. They get it out there and he's got room to run. The problem is he just didn't secure the football and wanted to take off and go. Because he had a lot of room to go around that corner. But he just didn't secure it. and the man downfield right here, 72. I mean, he's way downfield before that ball is out. Did not take that third step, as the saying goes. So put the time back on the clock. So the two-minute warning has not occurred. We got another flag. It's like June 14th here. Otherwise known as flag day, as you know. Clay Martin looks like a referee at a central casting. Looks like a young Terry McCauley out there. Terry was always tight in the unit, I thought, back in his day there. All right. After all that, play clock gets reset at 25. Giants have controlled the quarter, but still trail by eight. So first and 15 now. Singletary. It'll be second and 13, and that will take us officially to a two-minute warning at the Meadowlands with the Dallas Cowboys leading the name for the State Forum halftime show. Fits right there, talking about C.D. Lamb, I'm sure, at some point. The gang again working on about four hours sleep, composite lead. Second and 14 Short pass Tackle made immediately As Zonovan Wilson takes down Neighbors So this drive has consumed half the quarter Coming up will be the 14th play And they've only gone 51 yards in 13 plays to this point Again 5 of 8 Doing a pretty good job here Protecting Daniel Jones 5 of 8 on 3rd down to what Brian Dable comes up with. You would think trying to move neighbors around, trying to get him a matchup that's favorable. He's going to start off on the right. Starts in basically on a wing. That's Robinson in the backfield. There's your defensive alert. And two more flags. He did three hard counts there to try to pull them off. I think the third one was the charm. neutral zone infraction defense number 11 5 yard penalty third down Aaron Rodgers is watching this and appreciating this effort here on this third down from Daniel Jones And you know what? You have just enough hand movement, too, on top of it. Yep. And I think that motion also maybe caught their eyes a little bit. Now what? The Giants have elected to run the clock. To avoid that, the Cowboys will tell the timeout. Timeout on the field. Okay. Let's take a peek while we have this timeout at Daniel Jones and the efficiency he's played with tonight. Doing some really nice things. He's finding the open receiver, obviously, here. An easy one with neighbors. but that's a great throw over the top of Kendrick's. He's moved. He's had to use his athletic ability. I think he's moving the ball around. You know, it's not just neighbors. Robinson has had some opportunities. He's involved in the run game. I think the biggest thing is he's doing a really good job of being in command of what Brian Dable's trying to do and how they're trying to execute. Well, you know, you get picked in the first round, you're number six. You've got a franchise quarterback who retires in Eli Manning. You've got the history of the great quarterbacks here in New York. So, you know, it's kind of like the saga continues. Is he our guy? Is he not our guy? Yeah, he couldn't have loved watching hard knocks, I'll tell you what, this summer. Talking about the same thing, talking about trading up. Third down and four after that timeout taken by the Cowboys to avoid the runoff. They want to get the ball back. Jones under pressure. Avoids the sack for the moment, but gets sacked and a flag is thrown. being in the yard Eric Gray so we go with three backs who can carry the ball Singletary, Gray, Tracy and then of course you've got Neighbors so four guys have already carried the ball tonight great job there by Dallas a huge story has been what's going on with the interior of the Cowboys defense that time that's their job eat up those linemen and keep Kendricks free He's able to get downhill and make a nice play there close to the line of scrimmage. Second and 14. Jones flushed. Jones fires on the run. 26-yard line. That's his man tonight. Wendell Robinson making another catch to set up a third down and nine. So Jones has completed seven passes tonight in eight attempts and five of those passes to Robinson. and now they're going to walk Parsons off to the sidelines, so the officials see that he took a blow, and they walk, that's normally noted from upstairs, and they say get him off the field, and that's exactly what they did. He stayed down after the collision. It was near the end of this play. It might have been friendly fire from one of his own players. Players, he's going to hustle, try to get over to the play. And as he comes over here at the end, you'll see a Cowboys player come down right on top of him. He stayed down for a moment. That's why the official took him off. Looks like it was Marcus kneeling. So third down and nine. Jones fires a little behind neighbors who reaches back and makes the catch. But it sets up a fourth down and in comes the field goal group. How about that play in space by the linebacker, Overshawn? And you know they're going to try to get it to Neighbors on third down. They don't care if he's covered or not. They want to get him that football. Remember, Overshawn played some safety in college at Texas. Going back to those days there, being able to make that play, that's a tough tackle to make against Neighbors. He's physical. He's quick. He usually can get around that. Greg Joseph now trying to make it 7-6. 41-yard attempt. Made a 52-yarder early. early. Snap a little high, but Dillon gets it down. Joseph bangs it through. And with 11-11, Mazi Smith trying to come in to finish it off. Little collision there at the end. You can see his lower half maybe hit the head of Parsons, and right away the referee saw it, and Parsons didn't agree with it. He took him off the field. So he's in the blue tent. Get a report as soon as we can. So Joseph to kick off Cowboys on top 7-6 Each team coming in 1-2 Week 4 commences here tonight Starting with the Elliott is now in the backfield First time for Zeke Came up as a rookie Led the league in rushing Number 4 overall pick And Elliott picks up about 8 here We go to Kaylee Guys, Micah Parson was just handed his helmet back He's sitting on the bench but we don't have confirmation on his status moving forward. After he was taken off the field and right into the blue tent, they brought everyone in there that they could fit, including the unaffated neurotrauma consultant, the head athletic trainer, the team internist, and the head orthopedic surgeon. And yet he is out of that tent and back on the sidelines. And with his helmet. So good news for the Cowboys. Second down and five. And taken down in the backfield is Prescott after the fake handoff. Aziz Ojolari making the stop there. So Dallas face now with a third down and five. You know, I wonder if this is a read. And if it is a read, he makes the wrong read. You like to hand this ball off reading 51. If he stays wide, you've got to hand that football to Zeke Elliott, who is untouched into the teeth of that defense. He pulls it, and Ojolari is right there to make that play. Pressure. Caught. Can he get the first down? Loses the ball as he goes out of bounds. And the officials come over and appear to be ready to spot it a little bit short. Ferguson making the grab. Tackle is made there by Nubin. And they're going to mark it just shy of the 40. And the Cowboys will come up without a huddle. Under center. If they do, you'd expect him to sneak it. instead starts that hard cap will they really go they will to the fullback here goes Lipke again started to lose his balance but kept it two games what changed I know we're just focused on the next the next game so our guys say we knew this would be a division game great environment so we got to keep playing thank you all right so Mike McCarthy he wild they recovered the Giants their own fumble after that kickoff and started on the ground and that defense which has allowed less than two yards per carry does it again here mozzie smith takes care of singletary for a loss of three second and 13 yeah let's go back and look at that kickoff return because it happened pretty quickly on the right there i'll tell you the guy overshone has been everywhere on this football field not only playing great defense that time just throwing his body in there to be able to get that ball out, and the Giants very, very fortunate that Manhurts is able to recover that. Chris Manhurts saving the day. Second down at 13 now. Singletary in motion to the outside. Jones looked that way, then looks the other way, and that pass up at the 34-yard line to Darius Slayton. He holds that baby in for a first down. Really good patience by Daniel Jones. This offensive line is doing a nice job at taking care of him again. Watch him feel this, work to his left. I thought he might go here, but instead he waits for the crosser, and he ends up going downfield a little further to be able to pick up that first down. Each quarterback is now 14 of 16. Jones steps up in the pocket. To the outside he goes, and that will be Darius Slayton right there. picking up the first again, and the Giants on the move. Yeah, don't underestimate Brian Dable, the head coach, taking over those play-calling duties this year. You know, they haven't been as aggressive as I think he'd like to be. I think a lot of it's predicated upon how the flow of the game is going, how your own defense is playing. But here, making some adjustments, and they have come out giving the ball to Daniel Jones and letting him find some matchups. Neighbors is the man in motion. Here's the pass caught by Robinson. Big first half. Starts with an eight-yard pick up here. Gets the ball into Dallas territory for a second down and two. And I think one of the adjustments he made, you know, coming into tonight, all week we talked to him, he said, man, we've been watching Dallas. Everybody's talking about it. Worst in the NFL after three weeks of defending the run. We've got to win the line of scrimmage. We've got a line that we like. We've got to run the football with Singletary. Well, they haven't been able to run the football. So now he's saying, hey, let's just get the ball out quick. Let's try to protect the quarterback. And let's take advantage of these weapons we have on the outside. And second and two. Threading his way. Should have the first down. Goes Devin Singletary. On that right side, we keep talking about the line. The right side, both from the Raiders. Greg Van Roten came over. and Illuminor also came over from the Raiders. Ironically, you also have the Raiders' offensive line coach came over. So there's some continuity on the right side and really on the entire offensive line. You would think when you have three new pieces early in the year in September, you're going to have to work and find that rhythm. But with the line coach coming over from Las Vegas and the right side, both from Vegas, I think there's some built-in continuity there. Yeah, that was a major priority of the offseason, that offensive line of mess last year. Double fake. Tracy takes the pass. And Tracy picks up the first down. Stays in bounds. Breaking tackles. To the 25-yard line he goes. It's already four first downs for the Giants on this drive. Again, good flow, good rhythm, great execution. and we've seen Singletary, Tracy, again, that former wide receiver in college, came out of Purdue. He was at Iowa early in his career as a receiver. He's very comfortable with the ball in his hands getting out in the perimeter. And how about those linemen we just talked about coming over from Las Vegas, getting out in front and opening that thing up? Good protection. Good pass to the 10 neighbors. Nevers makes the grab. Malik Nevers pulls one in again. Six catches tonight on eight targets for 74 yards. Isn't it amazing what Daniel Jones can do when he's got a little bit of time to throw the football and he's got some weapons to be able to throw the ball to. Nevers sneaks out of that backfield, slips through that B gap. And I'll tell you, what a job of being patient, waiting for the linebacker 50. You can see him there coming down on Manhurts. It opened up just enough room for him to squeeze that in off of it and settles into that soft spot. I thought he might keep going. He recognized McFadden's getting out of the way, so he just kind of settled in. Him and Dak on the same page. And now they've got a shot here on third down and short. Four rush Dak escapes fires into traffic and that is caught by Hunter Lipte Number 40 fullback tight end H whatever you want to call him But a guy who's going to play, I think, a bigger role in a cowboy offense than anybody thought at the beginning of the year. Yeah, he caught a corner route last week on a nice scramble where Dak made a great throw. Here's another scramble. He's starting to look for 40 now when he gets into trouble. This guy's known really as more of a pounder, but has the athletic ability in college at North Dakota State. Running back, fullback, tied in, and showing what he can do these last couple weeks with his hands. The new Moose Johnston from the 41-yard line. Trying to cut it back is Rico Dowdle. Ging in a one. Rakeem Nunez-Roches, who needed some assistance coming off the field a few plays ago, back in there, makes a stop. They've got some size in the middle. Of course, Dexter Lawrence is a big issue and concern. There's a great look at Zeke Elliott, who's back in Dallas. We're in 15, his number in college. But, yeah, it's a handful in the middle. Dexter Lawrence, 97. They've got some size and some quickness on this defensive front. Short shot, quick throw, caught C.D. Lamb. Nothing to complain about tonight. To the 30-yard line, he goes. And a first down tackle by Deontay Banks. Jalari does a nice job of getting into the face of Dak Prescott. But this is the Dak Prescott at 2023. The accuracy, pretty tight coverage, not much separation, maybe even interference with that right hand. But look where he puts this football, right in front of CeeDee Lamb where he can make that play. Eighth play of the drive. Fired, caught, Lamb to the 30s. So C.D., who has made a four-catch game his hallmark for plus his career, already tonight has pulled in four and run for ten yards. Is it any surprise after the week last week, the emotions, the frustration, he and Dak on the sideline that we already showed and talked about, that they go tonight getting the football into his hands early and often? Second and six. Again, a short drop. Quick throw. And tackled is Tolbert. Inside the 30-yard line, Cordell Flott is there to make the stop. I think a lot of us are anxious to see, outside of C.D. Lamb, we know about Jake Ferguson, the potential of Brandon Cooks. Who are the other weapons in this offense that can emerge? People hoping that Jalen Tolbert, Jalen Brooks can be those guys, along with Dowdle in the backfield. Even Kevante Turpin, the special team case, could see more action as a receiver. Prescott fires. Caught. Cooks. Speaking of Cooks. First and goal. Tyler Newman, the rookie out of Minnesota, saving a touchdown there. First and goal as the clock ticks down to three minutes left in the quarter. Watch how he uses Jake Ferguson as his shield. He's manned up on the right there with Isaiah Simmons. He just gets behind him. Makes it very tough for Flott to be able to come off of that. Almost a screen set by the big tight end. And once again, look at Dak Prescott just feeling it tonight in his first quarter. He's 8 for 8 on this drive. Give it to Dowdle. He gets it to the 5. Dexter Lawrence, big number 97. Right in the middle of the stop and second down and goal from the Giants. five-yard line. Cooper Beebe is a rookie who played guard in college. A great player. He's moved to center. First time he's played center in his entire life. Watch matched up because the best nose guard in the NFL. Look at him use his power. Extend with his arms. Get off that block and make that play. Dak comes up in the pistol. On a second and goal. Surveys. Fires. Tip incomplete. In the traffic, Bobby Okereke breaking it up at the goal line. Flag. We've got a hold by the rookie left tackle. You have two rookies up there. This is going to be on Tyler Guyton, at least from what I saw, the left tackle. Offense number 60. Ten-yard penalty. Replace second down. Thibodeau on the other side of Brian Burns, the big acquisition that they brought in. And he comes around with some speed. Remember, if you're going to double and be concerned with Lawrence in the inside, you're going to lose. Tom Coughlin got him. to hold the ball high and tight. That's right. And the fumbles went away. Old school. Very. From the 48-yard line. You lady! Watch out! Play action. Clips it to single. Terry has some room to roam. And picks up 14 on a first down. Odigy Zulim making the tackle there with five minutes to play in the first half. We haven't talked about it since the Open, but the offensive line from the Giants, there's so much talk about the skill with Neighbors and Robinson, what's Daniel Jones doing. But if I'm a Giants fan, I really like the three new pieces that they brought in. There's John Runyon getting downfield, John Michael Schmitz, the second-year center. You know, they have a new right side of this offensive line. Daniel Jones is able to work in rhythm. They're able to run the football because of what they have now up front. So much better than where they were a year ago. ladies watch that through the middle stopped there for a gain of two Tracy the rookie from Purdue picked him up in the fifth round second down and eight good job of changing up a lot of these looks by Brian Dable who again calling the plays different formations different ways of attacking Dallas giving them a lot of looks trying to slow them down with pre-snap movement moving neighbors around. He's been in the slot. He's been outside. Now again on the slot here on the left. Second and nine. And a whistle. Clay Martin. 12 men in formation on the defense with the snap imminent. The five yard penalty. Second down. they've been rotating a lot of players there's 11 and there's there's number 12 right there so i just talked about how the giants are moving a lot of players on and off the field and obviously mike zimmers with a new scheme trying to communicate and trying to adjust back and forth and that time just one guy not able to get off the field just really no awareness to get off the field there with 12. Six penalties, 50 yards against Dallas for this point. Three and a half to the half second down and three. To the right side and into traffic goes Singletary. So third and short. I think this defense has heard enough about how they're the weakness of this football team, at least tonight. Boy, they've really shown up up front doing a much better job in the interior. And the biggest thing you could say is they're keeping these linebackers free, especially 50. Eric Kendricks, the veteran, only 1.8 yards of rush tonight for the Giants. Overshone is back in. Third down and three. Jones is going to keep. Jones is going to get the first down. Daniel Jones takes it to the 21-yard line. Stop by Booth. First down for the Giants on this drive, which has consumed six and a half minutes. And the next play will be the 12th of the drive. His eyes right there on 11. Good job of reading that. Then he picks up the block from the rookie, Theo Johnson. Daniel Jones, they just want him to be efficient, play smart. Anything you can do to slow down Parsons tonight. That zone read look makes him hesitant. and it allows the blocking angle there for Theo Johnson to help out. Lady! Like that! Off the fake again to the outside. Free, but dropping it. Flag is thrown. You got Robinson who dropped it for the moment. Taking it all the way down the field goes Malik Booker. Got the flag back at the 18-yard line, and everybody's going to come back in that direction. And that will also take us to the two-minute warning. Afraid to get the call. So we've got a man downfield for the Giants. That's what the flag's going to be. The question, of course, is it going to be incomplete? After replay assistance, the pass was incomplete. However, we have an eligible player downfield. Offense number 72, five-yard penalty. Replay the down. Jermaine Illuminor was just going to really brag on what it's to throw. Wide open, his neighbors. Wide open by 10 yards. I mean, the guy starts his career that way, and you let him run free down the left sideline. Now keep in mind, Carson the rookie is out, so Booth, 25, is in for him. He gives him a little double move. Talked about Dable being aggressive. That's third down. He goes right after the inexperienced corner. Andrew Booth tested him with your best weapon neighbors, and they win that matchup on third down. As you say, Carson out, so Booth faked out totally. 39-yard game. Giants to the 40 of Dallas. To the left side, on the ground, going next to nowhere and swung down is Singletary. Booth making the tackle there. Singletary with Dable, and Dable was the offensive coordinator in Buffalo. And as I say, last year in Houston, and I brought in this year, and he's the man. Yeah, and I think they like the rookie Tyrone Tracy as well, who will use them both. Singletary I think fits in perfectly especially if they want to run the football low center gravity can get behind that new offensive line and really give you some big tough yards especially in those short yardage situations Parsons on the sideline on this play second and seven Jones is going to keep it Jones a good runner Jones about two yards shy of the first down tackled there by Donovan Wilson and we have a flag our first of the game Referee is Clay Martin One official indicating a face mask Sometimes it can be overruled by somebody else We'll see During the run, personal foul, face mask Number 82 offense 15-yard penalty. Replay, second down. That's the Giants tight end. That's Daniel Bellinger. So it would have been a third down and two. Now comes back 15. Bellinger on Overshown. Talked about the zone read, getting him out on the edge. You see the face mask. At least we saw one on Overshown there. But maybe on the other side, you would have seen Bellinger. But that drive was going well, especially after they hit neighbors. They get across midfield, and things going well, controlling the line of scrimmage. Now they get behind the sticks. Third and two become second and 18. They go five wide here. Quickly, left side. Wondell Robinson makes the catch at the 41-yard line. Andrew Booth making the tackle for a short game. It will be third and 11 for the Giants. Interesting to see how Mike Zimmer adjusts. I mean, it's pretty obvious you have Trayvon Diggs on one side back from the ACL a year ago, and he's one of the top corners in the league. And then you've got not Carson, the rookie, but instead Booth, who hasn't played a ton of football, who's now in there and already Dable going after him. So what are they going to do with safety support over top? Because they're going to clearly try to challenge number 25 in white tonight. Coming up with three receivers to the right side. Indicating the guys who could blitz and they come and Jones is forced to throw quickly. And the catch is made, but short of the first down, that's Robinson. So back-to-back plays to him. Ball now at the 33-yard line. That's going to set up a fourth and let's make it four. Fourth and four. Jones did a pretty good job there just to keep that play alive, that pressure. They brought Wilson, the safety, up the middle. He got through clean, but able to recognize that and get the ball out. Give him a shot here anyway on his field goal. Greg Joseph has been around. So with Ganoe Hurt, they brought him in last week. He made all three extra points, but missed his only field goal attempt. This from 52 yards off the foot of Greg Joseph, and it is good. So the Giants get on the board first six minutes into the game. 3-0 New York. to Manhattan across the Hudson River the Meadowlands for the Giants on top and another kickoff into the end zone and the flag is down speaking of flags we're going to show you something in a second about that last call on the face mask meanwhile Clay Martin will determine what's happening here. Somebody moved at the 30-yard line. He tackled Thibodeau that time. There are fouls by both teams on the play. I'll bet. Outside, defense number five. Holding. Offense number 60. Those penalties offset. Previous spot. We'll replay the down. That takes away a shot at a field goal here. This hold because it was a free play. Here he is jumping off sides. Guyton is a rookie. He's going to be fine down the road. But once Thibodeau ends up jumping off sides, he keeps hustling to make a play. And Guyton obviously has to end up trying to keep him away from the quarterback. So Thibodeau comes off the field for the moment for what it's worth. In the last two minutes, Guy comes off. That costs you a timeout. The Giants have two, but probably moved at this point. Two officials still talking. Just kind of a microcosm of the first half. A flag is still on the ground here at the 35-yard line. It's a lot to clean up. Just a lot of flags. The player that was fouled by the offensive hold, there is no timeout. All right. Charge for the Giants. Now they changed that. Keep this in mind, 20 seconds. If they get tackled, obviously, inbounds, they're going to have to sprint out to have a chance at a field goal on this third down unless they're able to pick up the first down and spot the ball. Exactly. So there's Aubrey, who's living in another world right now. Almost never misses. 65-yarder last week. Will he have a shot at a long one next? Third and 12. Four-man rush. to the outside low. Incomplete. Brandon Cooks, the intended receiver. So with 14 seconds now. Fourth down. And in comes Brian Anger to punt. That was a big stop for this Giants defense. And again, I think they caught a break there with a holding call because Dallas would have had a shot at a field goal. But remember, with the Giants deferring in the first half, they get the field goal, they get the stop, down five, and they get the ball to start the second half. So Jones was 13 of 15 in the half. Prescott 14 of 16 for 164. You're kidding. False start. Offense number 30. Five-yard penalty. Fourth down. It's the eighth penalty now, right? No, it's the 147th. What was that shot of you and Frank Gifford, 1986? Yeah. You called a bunch of Monday night football games. Right. Thursday night and Sunday night. I don't know. Is this a world record for you in first half laundry? Absolutely. I think it's got to be up there. Without question. You're going to need some new flags to throw in the second half. These ones are filthy. Angers kick. We'll bounce inside the five. Yeah, there's another flag. In fact, there are two. We wouldn't lie to you. Oh, yeah. We're kind of feeling the same way right now. It has nothing to do with the score. Dallas number 89. The Giants will enforce it at the succeeding spot. It's first down. It's a quick halftime. Well, Jerry Jones and Stephen Jones. Well, the team at least is in the game as they haven't been the last two halftimes. And that takes us to the break. That is the end of the first half. Dallas 14 and the New York Giants 9. To a pair of Dak Prescott touchdown passes. Hello, everyone. I'm Carissa Thompson alongside. Each guy is going to be able to continue to play that way. And someone eventually, one of these defenses, is going to create that turnover that may end up winning the football game. Drop. Picked up. This is Tracy. And he gets smacked. Comes out. and that's the way the third quarter starts to Kaylee. Coach, Dak and your offense look sharp, but with those nine accepted penalties, how do you fix that? Yeah, definitely not too many penalties. We've had 11 calls, so we've got to definitely clean that up, but we had some big play opportunities slip through our fingers too, so we need to jump on these guys in the second half. Your run defense improved from the past? Let's see what they might want to continue to do. Boy, it was a great opening drive to start this second half. If you look at Dowdle, you know, we were talking now in our meeting this morning, and you're used to it. Some high-profile, huge name of the Dallas Cowboys starting running back. Here's Dowdle, you know, a guy that's a journeyman, fifth year, been a backup, kind of had to wait his turn. Nice run here. Yeah, I mean, you think of the Cowboys in the history, of course. I mean, Tony Dorsett, Herschel Walker, guy by the name of Emmitt Smith. Zeke, of course, came in, won the rushing title as a rookie, and now you know who. Yeah, and Dowell, he was a backup to Zeke in Zeke's prime and a backup to Pollard, Tony Pollard. He was third guy, and a lot of times just on special teams, and just by sticking around and improving and getting better, one thing for sure, he runs hard, runs with kind of a chip on his shoulder when he gets his hands on the ball. Quickly to the outside, and Elliott makes the catch. Elliott with New England last year. Actually, I think he led the Patriots in receiving yards. Yeah. You know, going all the way back to his days at Ohio State, you know, he's always known for his ability to run downhill and break tackles and have speed in the second and third level, but does have very natural soft hands as a receiver. Here he is again motioning out. Second and five. Lamb comes out of the backfield. He makes the catch. He spins. He can't get the first down. How about that as a changeup for Mike McCarthy? You motion out Zeke, and you keep 88 in the backfield. CeeDee Lamb, just to give the Giants defense just a different look, affect the communication, make them try to keep guessing where CeeDee Lamb might be. Now he's on the slot off to the left. Third and one. That's Lipke, the fullback in the backfield. Flare him out. And pass out of his reach. Flag is down. Amazingly, the first of the quarter. They may get that left tackle, the rookie again. Holding. Offense number 60. Ten-yard penalty. Replay third down. Guyton again. When you double inside, this is what happens. Guyton has tremendous length at 6'7", but as a young guy going up against Thibodeau, it's an inside move that got him again. He keeps kind of working the leverage to the outside, and I think you've got to give KT some credit for working outside and then using that power move to go back inside to beat him, and it's another time he got a holding call using that move. 42-yard line, third down and 11. And yes, they are in Aubrey's range. It will be 61 yards from here. Dak fires, and that's incomplete. Trying to hit Brandon Cooks, covered there by Cordell Flott. and in comes which unit right now? They're going to opt for Brandon Aubrey, who's become a tremendous weapon. No doubt about it. Exciting when you see a field goal kicker come out. Pretty good coverage here. I'll tell you, Flott, with all these injuries, has had to step up. They've had Duke Shelley out there off the practice squad, holding up pretty well on the back end. 60-yarder. Aubrey's kick. Yep. And back we come. Post Malone wearing his cowboy gear. Good buddy of Aubrey. On the field before the game. Signing tons of autographs. Crowd just looked at him on the big board. I think they also saw the Yankees defeating the Orioles. Right. And clinching. Yep. Thanks to division title. As Gray runs it back. Gray passed the 30. Gray out to the 32-yard line. Penalty is down. And we will go to Kaley in just a second. In a long time since we've heard from Clay Martin. So it's about time. Meanwhile, Lawrence is back out and getting taped. so we hope he can get back into the game. There's no foul to play for a block in the back. First down. All right, there you go. Pick it up. Kaylee. Guys, you saw Brandon Aubrey nail that 60-yard field goal, but he doesn't spend time practicing kicks farther than that. He feels the change is needed to get extra power. The rookie on the outside. It's a second down. Goal from the 15-yard line. Thibodeau on one side. Brian Burns. They got from Carolina. Number zero on the other side. Second down. And goal. Looks one way to the other. Sets up a little bit of a screen here. Donald takes off. Scores. But another flag is down. flag down at the 10-yard line. I think they've got another hold that will bring this one back. It's a good tough running, by the way, after the catch by Dowdle, running through the arm tackle McFadden into the end zone, but I think it's going to come back. Cowboys already back and rehuddling at the 25. The result of the play is a touchdown. Wow! Picked up the flag. No foul on the play. And just like that, the Cowboys were ready to huddle back at the 25-yard line, figuring it was on them. Brian Daymo saying, what the hell is going on here? And it's a touchdown for Dallas. Center 56 gets out there. 87, Ferguson. Looks like he may be on the outside there. Maybe gets a hold of the jersey right there with the right hand. But that's maybe what they saw. Either that or Beebe. But they pick it up after talking it over. And Dallas gets that touchdown. Heck of a run there after the catch, like I said. Replay assist helping to make the call. Brandon Aubrey for the extra point, which is automatic off his foot. And with 2.06 to go in the quarter, Dave O'Furious, the Cowboys, as they pick up the flag, have the lead 7-3. I welcomed everybody to the 1976 season. I said to Frank, it's already been a long year. One whale of a game. Meanwhile, we're going to get a run back here from inside the five-yard line by Tyrone Tracy. It swung down in the 22-yard line. When we showed that this morning, I thought 86 Giants. That was in their heyday, right? Dallas with Danny White and Herschel Walker. That was a fun one for you. It was. And then Phil Simms. You had Bill Parcells on one side. You had Tom Landry on the other side. The Giants, of course, would go on to win the Super Bowl. Phil Simms had a phenomenal day in Pasadena. Going 22 out of 25. Yep. That was the beginning. Long time ago. September 8th, 86. And Oprah Winfrey made her syndicated debut the same day. There you go. We're connected. First and 10 here at the 23-yard line. Singletary is the running back. Come up in the I formation, and Singletary will take the ball out to the 27-yard line. Dealing four, second down to six. You know, last series, remember they had that tough penalty that went against them, but you saw Daniel Jones in command on that first drive. He was 3-3, 53 yards. You know, you look at this Cowboys defense, remember again, if you're not familiar with it, they've got it. Their big emphasis on this short week of stopping the run, being more physical, especially in the interior. Brian Dable is going to keep challenging that. Singletary again. Stuffed at the 30-yard line. Eric Kendricks, several years in Minnesota. Last year with the Chargers. Picked him up in his 10th season in the league, third and three. And his familiarity with this game, he's almost like a coach with Mike Zimmer coming over. He spent so much time with him in Minnesota. and it's really, I think, helping the rest of this defense to listen to 50. He's out there. He sees it. He understands it. He makes adjustments on the fly. Very important piece to this defense this year. Jones to the outside. Caught. And a great little step there by Robinson to pick up the first down. Had him initially. Jordan Lewis was there. Took care of that with a little hop, skip, and a jump and a first down. Remember, with some of the injuries they have as well, Look at the motion. You see Flott running with him. Now Flott starts to communicate. See the adjustment by Dallas defense? They weren't able to react quickly enough, and there's the yards after the catch with Wondell Robinson. That's what he brings to the table. Ladies, watch out. 20 seconds to the end of the quarter. Neighbors. Looked like he was ready to throw, packs it in, and they chase him out of bounds. Parsons takes him to the boundary for a loss of three. It'll be second down and 13. Clock will roll, and that will take us to the end of the first quarter. After one at the Meadowlands. It gets to the 45-yard line. Broke away from a would-be tackle by Thibodeau, which would have created a turnover on downs instead first down Dallas. When Cooks goes inside, the corner follows him, and that opens up the edge. Lipke's showing over these last couple weeks. Again, you're just not used to seeing a lot of fullbacks be able to show what they can do with the ball in their hands, but he certainly has that ability, not just out there being physical in the run game. Second year out of North Dakota State to the sideline. Here goes Lamb. He gets spring on the inside. C.D. Lamb. Touchdown. And for a change, no flag. Got away from Banks Now they say there is a flag at the end Where is it Looks down at the goal line Never want to jump the gun with this crew. You're right. So they huddle. Is it after he's scored? Result of the play is a touchdown. Okay. After the play, unfortunately, like conduct. Fawning, number 88 of Dallas. This is his first towards disqualification. The 15-yard penalty will be enforced on the try. Al, look at the safeties right here pre-snap. As the ball is snapped, safety blitz here. Nice job picking it up. Middle field safety, one-on-one. Really well done by Dak Prescott. To see the pre-snap, safety comes down. Blitz, one-on-one. You've got to go to C.D. Lamb. take it every time against Deontay Banks and he wins it. And then taunting. I guess. This makes it a 48-yard extra point. And for Aubrey, that's not even a remote issue. So the Cowboys get the TD. 9-16 to go in the first half. And lead 14-6 on Thursday Night Football. Picked a 65-yard field goal last Sunday. It's this line drive to the five. Eric Gray, who fumbled the opening kickoff last week at Cleveland, in a disastrous start with the Giants, as Cleveland then scored on the next play with the Giants won the game. Kirk. Let's take a peek at Parson so far in his start. The Giants are obviously very well aware of him. They ID him. Zone read, instead of blocking him, we saw Baltimore do that quite a bit last week. Another one where you're just kind of keeping him untouched, making him make a decision. He's got two tackles on the night. Zero pressures, by the way. He's only been double teamed once. Here he stays home well, chases neighbors out of the sideline there. So he's off still holding his helmet, hoping he'll be able to come back tonight at some point. Singletary. Slips to the outside. Ball is out, but they're going to say he was down by contact. You've got Kendricks right there. Down by contact. Gain a two. Second of the eight. The runner was down by contact. It's been an issue for Singletary, who's fumbled in each of his last two games and is 16 in his career. Yeah, and, you know, he's talked about it this week, saying how he's not going to... That ball's wondering if that's starting to come out there. Well, you hear what the crowd is thinking. Yeah. Got the knee down. Dallas is going to challenge this. All right, you see what we see. I can't wait to see what Terry says because it looks like it started to move, but it wasn't clearly. Obviously, it wasn't out until he hits the surface. Meanwhile, Singletary being worked on. Dallas is challenging the ruling on the field that the runner was down by contact. Timeout. So that would have been a two-yard gain to the 30. They'll check it out, and we'll check out briefly. And it's called. The runner's left knee was down by contact. This is an unsuccessful challenge for Dallas. They will be charged their first timeout. So the call stands. It'll be second down and eight. Meanwhile, Singletary went over to the sideline to get checked out. On the other side, you got Micah Parsons, who was out and is now back in. Heard him say the knee down. I think a lot of people focusing on the elbow, but that knee was clearly down. Running back is Tyrone Tracy. Second in the knee. Jones is eight for it. Illegal formation, number one of the receiving team. The Giants have elected to enforce the five-yard penalty from the touchback spot to the 25-yard line. First down. Kirk, go back to that penalty on the face mask. Let's go back. We were trying to find the penalty and whether or not Bellinger actually got into the face mask of the linebacker over show. Remember, this is a 15-yard penalty. Face mask on 82 blue. He never touches his face mask. Instead, 13, White does grab the face mask. The Giants lose 15 yards. That's a 30-yard total. That would have been first and 10 at the 17-yard line with that penalty. They didn't put up much of a stink. Yeah. Pass over the middle is fought for a four-yard gain here. C.D. Lamb, who was not very happy last week and expressed himself as a Giant is down on his knee. That's Rakeem Unez Roches. But Lamb unhappy with his lack of production. He was very demonstrative on the bench. And then basically said during the week, my fault. I should be better. I've got to control my emotions better. And we'll see what happens tonight. Yeah, I think anybody who's followed his career, both at Oklahoma and Dallas, kind of surprised to see him lose it like that and the emotions. But I'm with you. I thought it was really stand up, great to see him come out middle of the week and kind of own it. Still working on the injured giant. Back after the shin on both sides of the ball. He said, I know that's not the player I am. I know not the teammate I am. Bad game on my end. Take full accountability. Better in the future. Going to be fine. And as you say, you didn't see that in college. And you rarely saw it since he's been in the pros, too. And to be honest, I think he's still as good as he is. I think he and Dak are still. Well, Dak even mentioned to us on our Zoom this week, he's still kind of finding that rhythm. They're just off a beat. And you know how it is. At any moment, they could get on the same page and everything could be fine. And they put up those big numbers. Second and five. Dattle stays in the block. And that's caught at the 40-yard line by C.D. Lamb. And we go to Kaylee. Yeah, guys, C.D. told me that he was being selfish on Sunday in the way that he let his second quarter fumble erupt his emotions on the sideline. He said it ticked him off watching that game back, but it taught him what not to do. He told me he took a hard look in the mirror and saw a man who's already developed a new character in how to approach a heated situation. He said, I was a part of the problem, now I will be a part of the solution. Gets a breather here. You've got Deuce Vaughn in the game as the running back. And he'll make the catch out in the flat and to the 45-yard line. And a flag is down. Clay Martin off to a busy start tonight. That would have been a four-yard gain. The pass was a forward pass. Pass interference. Offense number one. Ten-yard penalty. Three-play first down. So that's already two penalties on Tolbert. He had one on the kickoff, lining up illegally. And now here. Yeah, here he is with McLeod again. Remember, this giant secondary is under man tonight with Drew Phillips and Adoree Jackson out. It's a big question how they'll match up. But you're right. This time, the right call there on Tolbert on the pass interference downfield. So his first down and 20 Got Lamb lining up In the backfield Tight formation Toss to him There's a little bit of a convoy Threads his way through Nice game Gets out to the 41 yard line Tackled there by Jason Pinnock Second and 10 That's a good way to get him to football Whatever it takes Slot, put him outside Pitch it Little pin and pull Get him out of the edge You got a fullback The right tackle out in front and to him just being a natural ball carrier. I mean, you know what he can do after the catch. And here it gives you a great idea. I bet you back in fifth or sixth grade, he made a lot of those. So the Cowboys have run six plays and half of them to land. Two catches, one run. Dabble back in. Take it to him. And back dancing throws, caught, falling down, and stopped at the 48-yard line is the tight end Jake Ferguson to make it third down and three. Well, he did a really nice job here of settling on his route. It looked like he might continue thinking it was man-to-man. Instead, he settles. Got a hold against the Giants. Offense number 72. Penalty is declined. It's fourth down. It's Illuminor. Yeah, Al, watch. We keep waiting for Parsons on these third downs. Illuminor ends up holding him because he just went right through him. I mean, look at this. power. It gets down. Look at that push. The bend. The athletic ability. The power. Parsons came up right away looking at the official like, man, help me out here. That was impressive there. Mara family has owned this team for decades. John Mara at the head of the group right now. Greg Joseph. A 38-yard field goal attempt, and that is good. And a flag is down. I should make that a recording. A flag is down. It could be offsides on Dallas. Well, it was. Fourth and eight. Offside. Dallas number 30. Penalty is declined. Result of the play is a successful field goal. Cowboys are going to get the ball. And they will have two timeouts. Make it one timeout. one time out at their disposal. And then they've got Brandon Aubrey as their field goal kicker. So. Get it to your own 45. You've got a shot. His range is like Paramus or Shekaukas. And through the end zone. So we've talked a lot about Micah Parsons on the Dallas side. Let's talk about Big Dex, Dexter Lawrence. He's been double teamed seven of nine of his pass rush attempts. You get four hands on it. I mean, that's what you have to do against the best nose guard in the NFL. And when you haven't seen him double teamed, he makes plays like this against the run. Boom, comes down and makes that play. And then if he's not been double teamed, the ball's getting out in a hurry. There is screen where they just kind of baited him towards Dak Prescott. Already has three sacks this season. Pass caught over the middle, looking for the sideline. Can he get out of bounds? Yes, he can. The C.D. Lamb picked up nine. So Prescott is now 12 of 13, and Lamb has caught six on six targets. Yeah, and Dak Prescott obviously thinking at the very least, field goal range. They have the one timeout. Giants trying to keep everything in front of them. They have the two safeties back, obviously focused on trying to keep number 88 away from making a big play. Dax only missed was his first pass, and he's completed 12 in a row. And make that a lucky 13th as Jake Ferguson makes the catch before a very short game. O'Karake makes the stop. Prescott brings him up to the line quickly. Block ticking down. 40 seconds to halftime. All kidding aside, they're about five yards away from having a shot within his range. And now they're a lot farther. That's Thibodeau breaking in and taking him down. And a timeout will be taken here. Some flowing kisses. It'll be second down and 18. Timeout taken, and we're back in 30 seconds. Thursday. Time to shine. Flawless. Oh. Random wind look flawless. My new chair looked gorgeous Whole gang lit like torches Oh my goodness You're on the five. You got a little... And I come through real saucy Just got paid on flossing I'm a boss and I hang around bosses We always thought Sherm was a Beluga caviar guy. Oh, yeah. He'll run the gamut. Second and 18. Prescott to the outside They have to use the sideline here Tolbert makes the catch Because they are out of timeouts Now let's go back to the previous play Thibodeau against the rookie Guyton He's lined up to the outside You're expecting him maybe to go outside I think the tackle was But instead the power rush to the inside Fools Guyton and gets home Third and 12 Thibodeau came across the line You got a free play You got another flag You have two more flags in the backfield No more laundry left Colbert made the catch 29-yard line And any number of calls coming your way You got offsides You have free play And then you have a hold by the left tackle The rookie Guyton In there before Neighbors gets hit Great play Yeah, speaking of man hurts Oh, this drive to him as Jones avoids the sack throws incomplete, out of bounds. Pressure put on by Kendrick. Don't forget, Manhurts recovered that fumble on what could have been a disastrous beginning to the second half. That's right. This Dallas defense being tested. Demarcus Lawrence, 90, trying to get pressure. Just misses. I tell you, again, Daniel Jones is a big guy who's got athletic ability, 6'5", 230. pulling away from Lawrence there. But Brian Dable clearly opening things up here to start this second half. That's six throws and only two runs on these eight plays. Lawrence off to the sideline. Over the left side, picking up three. Singletary. Make it third down goal. We know who's been his target. Neighbors last week had a couple big plays against the Browns down in this area. and we've got a man down, looks like Leofal from the Cowboys. It is. And you saw Lawrence already on the sideline. Just to remind fans where Neighbors is and the big scores that he had last week. Off to the left. They bracket him, pass is caught, and taken down at the four-yard line is Robinson by Overshown. So it makes it fourth down and goal. So they use Neighbors as a decoy. Brian Dable trying to be ahead of it here. Here's Neighbors. He's going to occupy a couple defenders. Diggs, seven, also 13. Try to create some space to see if Robinson can make somebody miss. But once again, 13 all over this field makes a good play getting him out of bounds before the end zone. It's a ball at the three. Crowd, of course, doesn't like the field goal unit coming in. But as a famous coach said a long time ago, you start listening to the crowd, pretty soon you're sitting with them. Field goal is good from 22. So four field goals off the foot of Joseph. And early in the third, it's 14-12. Well, Mike McCarthy's been around a long time. A lot of success in Green Bay. Won a Super Bowl back in 2010. He and Aaron Rodgers together. A man who started his career as a toll booth operator on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Has had a lot of success as a coach the last three years. Mike has gone 12-5, but the bugaboo for the Cowboys is January. All about the postseason. Last year they were a team that became kind of the trendy pick, not just the way Dak Prescott was playing, but they were winning games and pulling away from people. Like you said, you get into the postseason, it doesn't happen. How quickly people forget about that regular season. So Joseph, who's done the job tonight, 4-4-4. Touchback also in that category. Two guys with good careers, but not a lot of success in postseason. To the outside goes the first pass here. A little jump move. They're going to whistle it down out of bounds after Ferguson was able to get by the first guy, but stepped on the chalk. Second down. Dak Prescott, if you're just tuning in, has had a great night throwing the football. He's 15-17 on the night. Some of these have been quick passes, and when it's not been, he's been very patient. Here he gets a nice block, picking up that blitz. Works from the right, comes back to the left to C.D. Lamb. Again, feeling it, looking for his guy. Instead, it's taken away. Able to eventually just check that down to the screen and make a big play there. So, done a lot of different things and big results. Little shovel. Ferguson takes this one, and he'll pick up the first down. That time you had Burns coming in from one side and Thibodeau from the other. Who do you think is the Cowboys' leading rusher tonight? Don't look. Oh, maybe CeeDee Lamb on that run that he had. Yeah, 10 yards. Dattle, four carries for eight. Lipke, one for six. Elliott, one for five. You see Dak after that throw gets hit, kind of flexing his hand after that hit by Big Dex. halfway mark of the quarter Dowdle and a decent run here as he takes it up to the 50 yard line Jones making adjustments here there he is double receiver Mike Zimmer can breathe an official sigh of relief Even with five seconds left, they've cemented the win. Think about that. 29 years of coaching in the NFL. Mike McCarthy brings him in this year to take over this defense. Had a great year last year with Dan Quinn. And they answered the call tonight, not only against the run, but through the injuries in a short week. Played with some newfound confidence that I'm sure they'll use as a springboard into their coming weeks that they have with the Steelers, the Lions, and the 49ers. Oruwarie, 50-year guy out of Penn State, bounced around, picked up as a free agent. One kneel down will take us to the finish line. Here we go. And there we go. Here we go, and there we go. And the Dallas Cowboys get to 2-2. The Giants drop to 1-3. Dak Prescott picks up a victory here. He has just killed the Giants. Last 13 in a row against the Giants. So the Cowboys remain the Giants' kryptonite. Winning by a score of 20-15 at the Meadowlands. 13 straight wins against the Giants Ford Dak on second and 20 trying to pick up a few there goes Zeke barrels his way out past the 15 tackled by Micah McFadden third down and a dozen Jake Ferguson checking back into the game here on his third down. A lot of times on third down for Dak Prescott, if he can't find CeeDee Lamb, Ferguson is kind of his security blanket. They've got him lined up both on this right side. Lamb started in the slot, and then he told Colbert to get inside. So Lamb is now outside, matched up with Banks. Dak goes the other way. Lipke makes the grab. but way, way short of the first down. And so the Cowboys forced the punt from deep in their own territory. Shane Bowen got a lot of recognition last week against Deshaun Watson for being a little bit out of character, dialing up a lot of blitzes. And on that third down, he walked some people up. I think Dak thought they were bringing the house there on third down, and it's a snap of the ball. They drop out of it, sit back in zone, the ball comes out quick, and they're able to rally to the football pretty easily. Brian Anger has hit two punts tonight. One for 60 and one for 50. To the 26-yard line. Smith-Marset has some room. Skips through the Cowboys and finally is getting taken down just shy of midfield. Good run back. And very meaningful games. And tonight for an early season game, very meaningful because the Cowboys have been reeling, the last two games. And this is the first of four of the next five games are on the road by a weak throw name. And, of course, the Giants just trying to get back to 500 and got it turned around last week and trying to keep their foot on the gas pedal. Yeah, and it needs two markets. You go to one and three, even though it's early in the year, that's a cynical bunch. You think? Yeah. From the 48-yard line, this is neighbors who's going to break a tackle and then got taken down after a gain of six. We go quickly to Kaylee. Guys, DeMarcus Lawrence, after a quick trip to the X-ray room, came back to the sideline training table to get the arch of his right foot taped to support it. He's got his helmet in his hands, but he is not back out on the field yet. Yeah, we see him right there. Huge part, obviously, of that Dallas D, and that takes us to the fourth quarter. After three at the Meadowlands. We're back in. I said we were in the Big Apple before. You get it. We're in East Rutherford. But this is like a second cousin to the Big Apple. Just across the Hudson. Beautiful. Back-to-back weeks. You go right. Second down and two. Singletary to the outside. Gets around the corner. Picks up the first down. And a flag is down. Another hold. 85. There you go. Man hurts. All right, holding. Offense number 85. Ten-yard penalty. We play second down. Amazingly enough, only the fourth accepted penalty against the Giants. Seems like about 40. And 11 accepted penalties against the Cowboys tonight. Yeah, any time you get to the corner like that with a back, you always wonder on the edge who made the block. It's Parsons. Man Hurts obviously locks him up. Easy call for the official. And a bad timing for the Giants. They're in plus territory. They got a little momentum, about to pick up a first down. Nice move there by Singletary. Made that second guy miss, and now they get behind the sticks. Second and 12. Back on their half of the field. Nabors swings over. East to the left, digs on him. In plan press. Jones goes the other way. Jones going deep. Does he make the grab? He does not. Darius Slayton had to slow down a little bit and could not haul it in. Ball is underthrown. And this is a bit of a storyline here in the second half with 27 who's on the practice squad. Oru Warier from Penn State is up. He's in right now for Andrew Booth. He gets beat off the line. The ball is underthrown, which ends up bringing Slayton back. But I'm not shocked at all with that press coverage. Why not go after the guy who was down on the practice squad and challenge him? Think about it. Carson, the rookie, opposite of Diggs, is not playing tonight. He's down. Booth came in for him early. Didn't work out. Now Oruwarie is in, 27. So that 11 sign. Something in his eyes. Martin, I mean, what an amazing career this guy's had. 11 years. Picked him out of Notre Dame first round. Number one pick back in 14. team. More Pro Bowls, more all-pro selections than Holden's or false starts. And think about this point again. You lose Diggs, now Martin's out. Prescott throws. Contested and incomplete. Flott is there. Taking care of Brandon Cooks. Good to see Martin back out in the field. I don't know if his right eye has much vision, but he's back out there. I'll tell you, Flott, who's been forced into play because of Drew Phillips being down tonight and Adoree Jackson, he's been holding up out there pretty good. Has great length at 6'2 to be able to get around Cooks there and make that play. Yeah, Cooks been targeted four times, caught only one, though, for 16 yards early in the game. On second and 10, Prescott fires to the sideline. That's holding, and that's the Cowboy answer to the Giants' number one, Jalen Tolbert making the catch. Big play there, 15 yards, and a first down to the 25-yard line. Really an all-around great athlete. Came out of South Alabama, 6'1", 195 pounds. Actually, baseball, basketball, football. Harry does a great job of putting that ball out early so he can work back to that, away from Flott. Back-to-back times, they run that same route. A different receiver this time. Tolbert comes down with it. Dowdle bouncing his way to the 21-yard line. Eight minutes to go in regulation. This is a huge drive for both these teams. They can sense that under eight minutes to go. Two-point game. We've got an injured player. This time it's the Giants. You've got D.J. Davidson. and it'll make the short trek over to the giant sideline if you're Dallas you hold them to a field goal or if you're New York you hold them to a field goal you feel pretty good you're still within a possession you give up a touchdown here and an extra point goes to a two possession game you're getting down to that seven minute mark and here comes digs back I'm not sure I feel that good the way that giant offense is going tonight, you know? Yeah. You don't want to get down by more than a field goal. No, you don't. Second down and six. And they give it this time to Lamb, but that's read perfectly by that giant D. So halfway through the quarter now, third down and seven for the Cowboys. So you give up some yards. It's expected against a Dak Prescott offense. Good to see Diggs back. And you get him to third down. This is where you rely on Thibodeau. This is where you rely on Brian Burns. Remember the left tackle? We just showed you some highlights tonight. It's been tough for Tyler Guyton as a rookie. He's got Burns lined up across from him to the outside. Strips to the right. Prescott, look out. Hit as he throws. And incomplete. And that's on the head. Thibodeau coming around the corner. to bust it up fourth down. Here comes Aubrey. You know, I don't know if he actually physically got to Dak Prescott, but you'll see Dak feel the pressure from Thibodeau off to his right, and I think it affects his accuracy. He senses it, and he just kind of falls off the throw to his left, and I think that's what brought the ball down. So Thibodeau having an impact tonight. I think Giants fans have been waiting for him to be that guy, and tonight he has been. Aubrey now. 40 yards. which he makes in his sleep. That's an extra point. Easy. East Rutherford, New Jersey. Temperature right now. Room temperature, 72 degrees. Great to see Diggs back from the IV that Kaylee had talked about, from the cramping. Parsons has been in and out since he got his attention. And Aubrey will put the Giants at the 30 Here our next stats powered by AWS Parsons against Andrew Thomas one of the best left tackles in the game Look at these numbers. 14 times they've gone up against each other in pass pro. Look what the big fellas done there. Just one pressure coming off that left side, the blind side of Daniel Jones. So really good job, even when he's been isolated, of being able to hold on there against that pass rush from Parsons. That's why I think Parsons has moved around, gotten the inside on some third downs, moved to the other side. He's back in the lineup, by the way. If you're a Dallas Cowboys fan, to sit there staring at potentially going on the road and potentially dropping a 1-3 to be able to get out of here with a win, chance to get healthy and get ready sitting there at .500 after four weeks is okay. Especially with an upcoming schedule. Elliott gets taken down in the backfield. That will take us to the two-minute warning as McFadden makes the tackle. So for Daniel Jones tonight, numbers were good, 29 out of 37 for 281. But they can't finish the drives. Five field goals. That won't do it. No, no. And, boy, Jones played well. I mean, he played well, played efficient, gave him a chance. But tough to do when you're not punching it into the end. If they hold on here, go to 2-0 away and 0-2 in the friendly confines of AT&T. Here we go. Dowdle. That guy's got to be really happy tonight. There he is. Yeah. Mike Zimmer. You know, he comes in. He takes over for Dan Quinn, who gets the head job in Washington. number five defense last year. And tonight, take a look at that. Giving up 464 in two games coming in. The Giants tonight are averaging 1.1 yard per rush. They did a better job at a defensive line getting off blocks, and they kept their linebackers clean. Kendricks you know about, but tonight, overshone number 13. I think they found their linebacker next to him right now. He played really well. He was all over the field. Through the 33 goes Dowell. So, they will take it all the way down here. Aubrey starts out onto the field. So, as it looks right now, I think a lot of people are very happy that there will be a field goal attempt right here. And others not so happy. And you do know what I mean. So this will be a 51-yard attempt. Oh, of all things, no good. It's his first ever miss from 50-plus. So the patient is breathing just barely, though. And not just a miss, but look where the field position is. I mean, it is the risk that you take when you have confidence in a kicker that can make these long kicks. The ball now will be at the 41-yard line for Daniel Jones, who is out of timeouts, is in deep enough in the Dallas territory to give themselves a shot. And don't forget, Neighbors is out. So crazier things have happened. no timeouts Jones looking for a chunk down the sideline and broken up intended for Robinson Malik Hooker goes for the interception and the ball goes over his head and Robinson gets behind him and I think he lost the football but what a risk that Hooker takes here trying to locate the ball go up and it goes right over top of him. Wow. No doubt. Robinson 5'8". Almost a MetLife miracle there. Neighbors has been diagnosed with a concussion. We're down to 22 seconds. Jones, pressure down the sideline. That's thrown out of bounds. So it's third down and ten. Yeah, you know, you had so much confidence right in Aubrey to kick one. But then again, considering that circumstance, and for the Giants to go, if you pooch punt it, you put them maybe at the ten-yard line, and now you tell them 90 yards instead of 59. Hail Mary, and who knows what happens. Yeah, and here you have 15 seconds left. You've got to come up with a way to be able to get the ball, Obviously, not just the first down, but you've got to get the ball to the sideline. Without neighbors, Hyatt now comes into the game. He's off to the right. Jones launching it deep downfield, and it's taken away. Or would just create bad habits, and he doesn't want to disrupt his normal kicking form. He told me pregame, he usually caps warm-up kicks at 58 yards, and by seeing where the ball hits the net, and he knows how much more distance it has. And in these conditions, he told me, he's good for a 68-yarder. Oh, I don't doubt that. From the 32-yard line, you wonder how far he can kick one. Jones to the outside. Neighbors makes the catch. Short game. Second down for Malik Neighbors now. Seven catches for 79. And continue here. This is second drive here to start this second half. And Brian Dable and his offensive staff, the adjustments are early and often. Throwing this football and trusting Daniel Jones to make good decisions. 20 of 23 tonight. 222 yards. Trey is the back on second and five. Jones keeps. Jones is going to get wrapped up. And Jones is going to get taken down to the 30-yard line by Marshawn Nealon. so they sack him. It'll be third down. This is a zone read that he misreads. This is one of the few mistakes that he's made. He's reading this guy right here, Neyland, and if he collapses on the back, he pulls. He gives him that look, and then comes out at the quarterback. So he needed to stay on that ride a little bit longer to really get a good indicator. That time Neyland, the rookie, got the best of him there. What you got? Right, right. Neighbors shifting over to the right side. Diggs staying with him. Press coverage. Jones the other way. But the tackle is made there by Jordan Lewis on Robinson, so it's fourth down. You know, I'll tell you what, that Cowboy defense doing a really good job on Neighbors. Aside from that one pass when they lost him to 39 yards, The other six catches are good for only 40 yards. Yeah, and they're mixing up coverage. They're rolling to him. That time they just left Diggs out on an island because they trust him. And how about the play on the inside there by one of their great leaders, Jordan Lewis? Nowhere to go with the yards after the catch. Giants' first punt. The Scottish-born Jamie Gillen. Left-footed kicker with a backspin. Fair catch is called for. made at the 18-yard line by Kevante Turpin. Under three to play in the touchdown passes. Good night for Jones as well. Only three misfires and 228 yards total. Meanwhile, neighbors had that 139-yard catch. He scored seven overall, but that Dallas defense doing a good job on him tonight. Meanwhile, Lamb, seven for 98 and a touchdown. Five-point game, 257 left in the third. Cowboys begin to strike from their own 18-yard line. Start with a run. And a hold. And that's Zeke Elliott. With a flag, in fact, a pair. In the offensive backfield. See, I think we've had a lot of, not just one flag, but a lot of pairs. Yes, we have, yeah. A lot of agreement out there tonight. Kind of short of. Maybe not up here. Right. There are two fouls on the play. Holding. Offense number 73. Penalties decline. Holding. Number 56. Ten-yard penalty. Replay first down. Take your pick. That's not good when you have the center and the left guard. No. On a hold. And then you signify one guy and the other guy. And now it's going to be on his rap sheet. And the other guy gets away with it. Right. So now first and 20. God's getting impatient. And I don't blame him. Took a lot of reset it. Back to the nine. Land takes the give, and he is taken down by Brian Burns, who's had a pretty quiet night. But Burns, good beginning to his career in Carolina, came over in a deal. The Giants needed a good edge rusher, and they went after Burns and got him. Yeah, how about the left tackle, Guyton getting Thibodeau and now getting Burns. Love, I kept his outside arm and shoulder free. Able to be able to keep contained there. In case C.D. Lamb, who's been in the backfield now three times, might bounce that. He's right in perfect position. Tough thing to do against the speed of this defense. Now with Diggs out, they're going to look for who's coming in to replace him. There, in fact, is his son. Has to come out for at least one play. And it's going to be third. Now they're going to take him all the way back into the locker room, in fact. So it's going to be a lot more than one play. Not even the blue tent. So now the pressure. Mukwamu, the backup nickel, 24 comes into the game. 6-4, by the way. Very, very different style. He's going to be out on the edge on the outside. So who does Jones want to pick on here? neighbors to the outside third down 14 on the right side and incomplete little under thrown at the 10 yard line Darius Slayton is there another under thrown ball to number 86 and it's fourth and 14 in comes Joseph Parsons almost got in there Carl Lawson that pocket closes down in a hurry He's really tough to just follow through on that throw. Got enough on it to give Slate a chance. Look at how they move Parsons off the edge into the inside against the left guard, John Runyon. Joseph trying to go 5 for 5. This one from 42. And it's good. It's replacing Graham Gonneau. He's done the job tonight. He's accounted for all of New York's scoring, 17-15. The NFL and the American Cancer Society created Crucial Catch because early cancer detection can save lives. Don't wait. Visit NFL.com slash Crucial Catch to find your local cancer screening resources and learn how to reduce your cancer risk. So 17-15, the Cowboys on top. 11-11 to play. In the fourth. Joseph sends it into the end zone. Down there. Starting at 30. Kirk. Big story tonight has been, Dallas has a couple rookies. Cooper, Beebe at center, who's been getting help. So Tyler Guyton has been on an island quite a bit, and it's been tough. Some holding calls, been going up against Burns and Thibodeau, who's had his way working outside, back to the inside. Been very, very challenging for this young man who, again, has a very bright future, played a lot of right tackle in college in Oklahoma, and in the NFL, Dallas, four weeks into his career, has been asked to step up on the left side. One tough night's work. Pass is caught here, taking it close to a first down. is the tight end Ferguson. He signals first down. The officials say not quite. Of course, Lee Corsa would say not so fast. How about 11 minutes to go here? We got a two-point game. We talked about the dominance of Dallas in this series. Both these teams need a win. Somebody's going to be 2-2. Somebody's going to be 1-3. Second and inches. Here we go. This is Dak and pick up the first down here as Dabble takes it up to the 45. To Kaylee. Guys, Trayvon Diggs is back in the Cowboys locker room getting an IV to treat him for dehydration. So that confirms the cramp that you suspected, Kirk. We're told he's questionable to come back. Okay, so we saw him go to the locker room, not even to the lieutenant. Yeah. That's why, meanwhile, you got Zach Martin just came out. The all-pro right guard, T.J. Bass, is in there on the right side. That's another young guy. Play fake. Throws. And that's Ferguson again making the grab here. Nice catch. And we've kind of seen this reoccurring tonight with Dak Prescott on early downs. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. Look at that first and second down. Is that pretty good? 15 of 15. 154 yards and a couple touchdowns It's over 23% Overexpected So doing a really good job with that play calling And finding some of those matchups That are helping him Make some good reads and getting the ball out in a hurry Meanwhile you saw them working on Martin on the sideline And they'll pick up a first down Here on a second and short As Dabble takes the ball To the 40 yard line 11 personnel One back, one tight end, and Daniel Jones will take a timeout here for a third down and a dozen. Prescott trying to stay loose. Giants right now have over an 11-minute advantage in time of possession, doing a pretty good job of keeping him and C.D. Lamb and company on the sideline. Third down, you know, if you're dable and you look into that secondary and you see Diggs on one side and you've got a young guy that doesn't have a ton of experience and 27 on the other. You're just trying to find a way to create a matchup with your best guy against him. Diggs doing a pretty good job of moving around. Now they get the matchup up top. There it is. Neighbors against him. 27. There it is. Three by one. Three receivers to the right on third and 11. Jones looking straight down the middle. Coming this way. Eyes downfield, throws, caught, breaking a tackle, but still shy of the first down is Robinson. Robinson now has caught 10 passes for 69 yards. Dable's been conservative tonight on these decisions. These either-or, the analytics say to go for it. He has been conservative. Here we are in the fourth quarter, bringing in Theo Johnson, and he senses this is the time he's got to pull the trigger and get aggressive. Fourth down and three. Huge call here. They give it away here. The Cowboys would need one first down and Aubrey would be in range. Diggs this time follows Neighbors. Bring pressure. Jones throws and it's caught. Cutting inside was Neighbors. Slow in getting up. Help to his feet. And a first down. What a job of getting this ball out in a hurry. Look at that inside leverage from Diggs. He still is able to give him a little jab step and work to the inside. Timing once again perfect here. Parsons was closing in on Daniel Jones. He does a good job of getting that ball out. He's now 24-28 tonight. See, there's Parsons close. But, again, the efficiency of Jones tonight has just been superb. Very big first down, two minutes into the fourth. Parsons still on the sideline Play fake Over the middle Neighbors again Flag is thrown though 21 yard line The flag is down at the 25 yard line I think that's going to be on Dallas Defense number 27 I just talked about him They end up moving Neighbors over there trying to make this young corner have to adjust. He gets physical with him, and not that it matters because they'll take the catch, but a good job moving him away from seven. Get him over here. There's 27. Gives him a little chuck there. That's where the flag came in, but still able to get the ball to Neighbors, who's starting to come alive a little bit more here in this second half. Neighbors and Robinson each with 10 catches. Then play action. And this time it is neighbors, but he will go nowhere. Tackle there. Yard behind the line of scrimmage. Second down and 11. That looked nasty. I'm just glad to see that he got up from that hit as he submarined him, went low. See neighbors, that's on the season. Second most through four games in NFL history with the receptions. Closing in on 400 yards. And Dable here in this second half of the game on the line is dialing him up. as much as he can. Yeah, Puka and the Rams at 39 last season. Beginning of his career. A little toss back here to Singletary. He's going to cut it back. Jones comes in to look for a block. Puts a guy down, but not enough to spring him. Leofield comes in to make the tackle, and that sets up a third down and 14. Looks like Diggs is down. so they work on their number one defensive back. Here's what happened. That ball came all the way back to the left. Diggs just trying to get involved there to clean it up. It was a really good play by Malik Hooker as he was pursuing and running the football. Leofow involved, obviously. Not sure about the decision by Singletary there on second down and long. I understand trying to keep a play alive. Looks like he may have a cramp there on that right leg. Trying to keep the play alive, but to bounce it all the way back. Sean Neyland is in. Sean C. Goldston is in, replacing them. And the Giants right now have a fourth and six at the 45. The Giants tonight are three for three on fourth down. Have to get to the Cowboy 49-yard line or turn it over. Jones surveys chased away chased from behind downfield he throws does the catch count it does not David does not meanwhile the officials now conferring with each other and all three are saying no He never had possession of the football. That was going to take over first and ten. That's a good job of the officials coming together. The official behind neighbors thought he may have been able to hold on to the ball from this perspective. But you can clearly see that the ball does come out. The crowd, of course, doesn't like the call. But clearly it is incomplete. So they turn the ball over. And now they're forced in a position to have to use their timeouts, and they only have two because they had to spend one in the third quarter when Jones had to take a timeout. How about the effort there by neighbors just to toe tap to try to, if he holds on to that ball, his feet are down. Well, coming into the game, just, and we highlighted it at the very top, A spectacular debut. I mean, kind of shades of when OBJ broke in a number of years ago and made great catch after great catch. So he's able to get up. Meanwhile, Parsons comes out of the tent but onto the cart. The Cowboys at least have the mini bye week and won't have to play another game for 10 days. They'll take neighbors to the blue tent as well. So the Cowboys don't have to play another game until they go to Pittsburgh in 10 days. As Parsons goes back to the locker room, there is Diggs. The Giants, meanwhile, their next game is in 10 days at Seattle. No bargain. So now the Cowboys can play a little clock ball here. Two timeouts for the Giants plus the two-minute warning. Start on the ground. Zeke. Little shades of the old Zeke. Not quite the complete old Zeke, but, you know, 82.3%. It helps when you have an offensive line that's opening up a hole and letting him get downhill and run into that second level of that defense. Just wonder for the Giants down five here. You know, obviously Dallas is going to work clock. You got the two-minute warning. One more timeout. Dable hoping to be able to hold them to a field goal attempt. To be able to be down still within a possession. The field goal would make it an eight point game. So right now it's going to be second down and three. They've got one timeout. Two minute warning. Took their second right there. Diggs recovering on the sideline. Let's keep going back and forth. Hand the ball off here. Elliott puts his shoulder down, comes up a little bit short, and the Giants have to take their final timeout. The Giants call their third and final timeout of the half. 30 seconds. Well, this game has not been, you know, a barn burner or a work of work, but the Cowboys have to be so much better. I mean, just getting shredded the last two weeks by New Orleans and Baltimore at home. The defense has come together tonight and under adverse circumstances as well. Missing Lawrence a lot. Parsons has been in the end of the game. Have to be proud of what they've done tonight. A lot of injuries, but they've done a heck of a job just with the mentality of the defense. There's neighbors out of the tent. The mentality, just the way they've been playing. It's been, if I'm a Cowboys fan, I'm very excited to see this effort, especially in a short week with those injuries. Third and one. They give it to the fullback, and he gets a yard and a half, and that is enough. Lipke. Picks up the first down. So the only time the clock will stop now is at the two-minute warning as they take neighbors back into the locker room. Again, the Giants have that many by week two, so ten days until they go to Seattle for their next one. Physical game tonight, sloppy game, you know, with all the penalties. But I don't care. So they've got the full complement in right now. Diggs is top of the screen. Neighbors came to the bottom. Jones rolling and looking and throwing and out of bounds. Incomplete. Threw it away. Second down and ten. The defense from the Giants did their job. Under seven minutes to go here. You're within five. Daniel Jones gets a ton of criticism in this town. He's dealt with the hard knock stuff. Kind of a prove-it type of year for Daniel Jones. Now he's got a chance to potentially lead this offense down to a game. go-ahead score, maybe a game-winning score against their big rival here in primetime. Dallas has won 13 of the last 14 meetings between these teams, including six in a row as Jones throws. That's caught up in the 35-yard line. Theo Johnson, you're right on me. Nobody's been in the crosshairs more than Jones. You're the number one pick. It's his sixth year. I mean, it's quite the saga. We talked to him the other day, and I said, you know, maybe you'll be here for 10 more years. What are you going to say, what would you like to say to the next Giants quarterback? He said, make it all about football. Forget about everything else. Here's Joe Shane, the general manager. Think only about football, which is hard to do in this town. In any town, actually. He tries his best, doesn't he? Yep. Third down and four. Pressure coming. Pass is caught. And does he pick up the first? No. because Wondell Robinson is tackled there by Rure. And that makes it fourth down. So Dable looks at the sheet. Fourth down. About a half a yard to go. That's one, as a quarterback, you'd love to see Robinson run that route another yard or two further. So when you get hit, you're beyond the sticks. Two-eighties. Hands it off. Singletary puts his head down with the naked eye, looks to have it. And will. Just enough of a push here. Let's take a great overhead view of this. Some penetration there initially. Dallas had with some big bodies in there, but he's able to bounce that away from that penetration. See Wilson trying to get in there, overshone, but a good surge there gets the first. Inside five minutes. Jones under pressure to the outside. Neighbors, forward progress, a stop there by Jordan Lewis, second down. That's 12 catches now for Neighbors, and you've got to think with what he's done here early in his career, This is go time for him. We've seen him get more opportunities in his second half. Dable was trying to figure out where can I get him matched up. Zimmer's thinking we've got to stop one, make him go to somebody else. Second and six. In the backfield, that's Parsons. Takes Tracy down as he takes the handoff. and we just talked about that matchup with he and Andrew Thomas. Thomas done a good job in pass pro. Look at this move outside and then back inside. Set him up and then get inside of him. I mean, that is against a really good left tackle. Superior play right there by Micah Parsons at crunch time. Outside move, inside. There's that lateral quickness that makes him so elite. Every third down in crunch. Time is vital right now. Here's another one. Clock ticking to 340. Third and six. Bigs following one everywhere up top now. Jones over the middle. And that's incomplete. You had Robinson looking for a flag. Covered there by Jordan Lewis. Fourth down. And you got an injured Cowboy back at the 35-yard line. And that's going to be Parsons who's down. And ball got in there. Robinson, anytime you get both hands on the football, chance to be able to catch that for a first down. Parsons, remember we talked about him moving from the outside, this time right over top of the center. Get hung up with Greg Van Roten. And he's down again. So they work on Parsons. Lawrence there. He is. He's out. They're two key guys.
