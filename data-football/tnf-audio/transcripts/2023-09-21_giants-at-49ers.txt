 Mike Whitley as the head coach of the 49ers. Graham Ganota kickoff for the Giants. Ray-Ray McLeod is back for San Francisco. 49ers home opener before a full house of close to 70,000. And off we go from Santa Clara with a touchback. So the 49ers start from the 25-yard line. One of the great stories, of course, in the league last year. Brock Purdy, out of nowhere, the last guy picked in the draft, known as Mr. Irrelevant. Spent four years playing in college, so he was, he had plenty of experience, even though he had no professional experience, and had a marvelous season. And he starts here, comes off elbow surgery, sustained that injury in the game against Philadelphia in the divisional playoff. starts out of the pistol here. Juszczyk goes in motion, as he often does. And give it to McCaffrey, who's off to a big start this season, gains about four. Xavier McKinney makes the tackle there. Yeah, Brock Purdy, just a perfect fit into this game with Kyle Shanahan, the complexity and what they do with this offense. You know, in this era of spread and up-tempo, this is kind of a throwback offense that Kyle Shanahan has. Of course, his dad had such a big influence on him. You'll see a lot of two backs. You'll see a lot of motion, a lot of pre-snap movement. And, of course, Brock Purdy, great command of it all. Put Hughes check in the backfield. They do that a lot. The two guys go to the right, and the pass comes to the left. And it's incomplete. Intended for Debo Samuel. It'll be third down and five. I'll tell you, a good story to follow. And now you see Deontay Banks. You know, this is a complex defense in their own right. Wink Martindale had such a great reputation in this league. Spent 10 years at Baltimore. Won a Super Bowl. And one of the more aggressive defensive coordinators. He's got two rookie corners in Banks on one side, who you just saw in coverage. And then Trey Hawkins is on the other side. One of the big surprises of camp and ends up starting for the Giants. Banks was a first-round pick. Hawkins was a sixth-round pick. Third and five. Giants come. Pass is caught. First down. Out to the 43-yard line. Giants putting pressure that time on Purdy. Gets it away quickly. McKinney makes the tackle. First down, San Francisco. Right on cue. They bring that pressure, and he anticipates that and realizes he's got to get the ball out in a hurry. They brought one more than they could handle, but in the quick game with that quick slant, of course, to Debo Samuel up against the rookie, Banks. He's able to, that time, hit him in stride and pick up this first down. 49ers have won their last 12 regular season games. Ten last year, first two this year. And two in postseason before they lost to Philly. A little spinorama here. Purdy throws down the sideline, and it's Kittle who can't make the catch. Coming over to covering on the play was Adoree Jackson, helping to break it up until he's second down and ten. I think Brock here still just kind of feeling his way, trying to get a good feel for the coverage and what they might be in. If you look back at the Giants, they're sitting back in zone, and he just doesn't see that corner sitting there. Very fortunate that Kittle's able to get that left hand up and knock that away. That is a potential interception there by Adoree Jackson. Second down and 10. 49ers love to use motion. Nice hold here. Exploited by McCaffrey. Stays on his feet. A lot of yards after contact. Enough so that he picks up the first down in Giants territory. Nunez Rochas makes the stop. You see the guard Burford and also, of course, the pullback use check leading the way. And the patience, I think, is the thing that really is unique about McCaffrey. And then he's not just fast. I mean, he lowers his shoulder, runs through those arm tackles, and picks up those last few yards for the first down. So sudden when he gets into contact. Highest paid running back in the league. At a time when running backs are not happy with what they're getting paid, here's McCaffrey. So far, he's earned every buck. Takes it to the 40-yard line. Not only, of course, a great runner, but they use it out of the backfield a ton. Great receiver as well. So many different things within this offense. And as you said, Kyle Shanahan is smart in the way he utilizes him. His skill set, just a perfect fit within this offense when they picked him up last year. They're going to take him out right now because he played the entire game last year. And they didn't even activate Elijah Mitchell. But Mitchell is in tonight. And again, they're playing on four days rest. Second down and four. So Mitchell played in the opener, but not last week. Off the play action here. Purdy looking for something and finds nothing. And gets taken down there by Thibodeau. A little action going on after the play. But no flag. Back in 30 seconds. Hard punt. no return and the 49ers will take over the 28 yard line 35 of his first 11 for 68 yards McCaffrey is carried four times for 21 play action knocked down at the line of scrimmage Giants getting their hands up and Purdy still trying to find the mark tonight again really good push this time right here by Davidson just working to the interior of this offensive line can't get there but does get his hand up to bat that ball away the one area that's a real strength to the Giants. They've got to be able to win is the interior of this line of scrimmage. Lawrence, Williams, A'shaun Robinson, you see D.J. Davidson. Reset the play clock to 10 seconds. Going to respot the ball at the 28-yard line. Second down and 10. taking McCaffrey passed over the middle is caught by Devo Samuel up at the 35 yard line, whacked there by McKinney right there as the ball got there third and three he times himself, that's an RPO see the right hand trying to knock that ball away, gives you an idea how physical Samuel is McKinney came in there with a lot of force but somehow Samuel with the strength there, is able to hold on to that football. Almost came out, but he held on. Ineligible receiver downfield. Offense number 71. This is a five-yard penalty. We'll replay second down. First flag. Trent Williams, still regarded by a lot of folks, is the best left tackle in the game, certainly in the conversation. It is 14 season, 35 years old. Al, that's the danger of these RPOs. You know, quarterback's reading that linebacker, and here's his read right here. If he goes with the run, he's going to pull it out. So pull, and you throw. The problem is those offensive linemen are thinking they're blocking like a run. He gets downfield. Second and 15. Fired, and that's incomplete. Right there was Kittle, but good play by McKinney again. Getting right there. Bang, bang. Third and 15. He followed him out in motion, playing man-to-man. Giants love to play man with Martindale's scheme. It's a tough ask out of any safety. McKinney is a guy that had that injured left hand, has come back this year, gets his eyes up. Again, nice job just being right there. Ball that Kittle probably would normally catch, but again, tight coverage. Nowhere to go after that catch, even if he's able to come down with it. Kittle a little shaken up on the play, but there he is on the right side of the line. goes out into the pattern. That is caught by Samuel and off he goes. He of course is a master at yards after the catch. Proves it right there. So on a third down and 15 he picks up the first down. We're used to seeing Trent Williams get out in front but he gets tied up so you see 65 Aaron Banks leading the way. That was the puck. Nothing like getting behind an offensive guard that's 325 pounds for Debo Samuel. Just gets right behind the big fella right there. Takes two Giants out and gets first down yardage. Gain a 30 on the play. At the Giants 47 yard line. To the ground. To McCaffrey. Close to a first down. His fifth carry of the night. Gave 30 yards. He's going to spot it a tad shy. Great job with a vision here by McCaffrey. This play starts to his right. You're going to get blocking all the way on the left side. Look at this push. Puts able to kind of just anticipate that backside cut. Feels it. Here's that vision and patience. And then, of course, he accelerates. Came over as a free agent from the Colts. Picks a four to be second down and six. It's a run pass option. He could have either handed that ball off to Breida or gotten it out quickly to Campbell. He opted to pull it out. And again, plenty of time there. Not feeling hurried at all, which is a great sign for the Giants so far. Now Gary Brightwell comes in. Breida out. Third-year man out of Arizona. Sixth-round pick back in 2021. As Jones retreats, steps up. He's going to, I thought, keep it. But no, he throws, finds the open man, and it's a first down of the 23-yard line as Brightwell comes out of the backfield to make the grab. And there you go. Great job here is sneaking out, and this is the athletic ability we talk about with Daniel Jones. Just enough to be able to get away from some of this pressure. And look at the feel. Just kind of flips behind the linebackers, and the threat right there of Jones taking off brought both the linebackers, Burks and Warner, toward him, and it opened up for Brightwell to get right behind the coverage. Ninth play of the drive from the 30. Jones to the outside drop. Right there, Brightwell dropped it. You know, it's important, I think, for the Giants on this drive. Remember, the defense was out for almost seven minutes. I think a three and out would have been not disastrous, but no good. Yeah, and I think when I thought about them potentially putting points on the board, I thought, boy, it's going to be tough to move the ball against Steve Wilkes and this defense where you go 10 plays or 12 plays. You thought they'd need explosives, but here they are in their opening drive really executing incredibly well. Wilkes did a great job after Matt Rule got fired last year in Carolina, gained a two here for Brightwell. Wilkes was a big pickup. I thought he did a fantastic job in Carolina. him. He interviewed for the head coaching job, but it went to Frank Reich. He did coach one year as the head coach of Arizona. This guy is a heck of a coach. And you and I had them late in the year and thought that, boy, he is really starting to get this team to believe. Last year meeting Carolina and one of the more respected defensive minds in the league. Third down and eight. Jones is four out of six to 37 seven yards on this drive. Hangs in there. Throws its paw, but well short of the first down. Paris Campbell hanging on. Oliver makes the tackle, and the Giants will try to knot it with a field goal. As you said earlier, Al, a heck of a job of just putting this drive together, moving it down into San Francisco territory, and then giving Gano a shot here to tie this game up. Graham Gonneau picked the game winner last week in Arizona at the gun to win it by three. This one 44 yards away, and Gonneau bangs it through. So the Niners score on their first drive, and the Giants... You and I talked about it, that World Series that you called that year. The earthquake, 1989. Don't need a reprise. No, we don't. So 3-3. And Ganota kickoff. Beautiful night. The temperature is 67 degrees. Clear skies. Nice little breeze. D'Abel's got to be excited. The fact that, remember, the Dallas game, they're on 26-0 halftime. Last week, Cardinals down 20-0 halftime. So here they are, early. Much better position than they've been these first two games. First time they've scored in the first half in the three games. Start from the 25-yard line. So you think about the 49ers. This is a franchise that has won four Super Bowls. Bill Walsh won two. George Sheavert won two. But none since 1994. And the Giants also. Four Super Bowls. Two under Bill Parcells. Two with Tom Coughlin. It's incredible. You've got to go all the way back to 94 in a game that you called against the Chargers. that year where Steve Young was able to get it done because they just feel like they've been so close, which they have, and they're just not quite able to get over the hump. And I think they feel they can this year with Brock Purdy at quarterback. From the 25-yard line, gain of a couple right here, Elijah Mitchell picking up two, and they get second down at eight. Just feels like you're going to start to see Debo Samuel get some big opportunities. Do not be surprised if you start to see Ronnie McCaffrey can't get away to the nine-yard line. Bobby Ocarike making the tackle. It will be third down and five. It's two middle linebackers being asked to make plays. That defensive line, a lot of times they're just eating those offensive linemen, trying to free up that second level to be able to get downhill and make plays. O'Karake, that time fighting through traffic. Both those guys playing with an aggressive mindset tonight there in the middle. Niners already had seven third downs and converted five of them. This is the eighth. Third and five. Game tied almost halfway through the second quarter Birdie throwing It's caught Touchdown And a flag is down on the far side of the 11 yard line So for the moment, Ronnie Bell gets into the end zone And the 49 is indicating the call is going to be against the Giants It's a Ronnie Bell rookie 7th round pick At his first NFL reception tonight Here's Hocky Lee Offside Defense number 53 Is lined up in the neutral zone The wing on the field is a touchdown That has been confirmed He's lined up all sides here but he's got this option, or he's got McCaffrey coming underneath. That's what we talked about with Iyuk out. You still have a great receiver in the rookie, Ronnie Bell. Played really four years at Michigan. Has a lot of experience, a lot of confidence. A good job adjusting as a rookie. Knew to get both those feet down as quickly as he could. Rookie on rookie with Banks covering on the play. Extra point by Jake Booty is good. And with 7.49 to go in the opening half, 10-3, 49ers. I mean, you have a couple series where you're feeling good and you're doing about all you can, right? But they just have so many answers to whatever you're trying to take away. They figured out, and they end up going a different direction. Yardage better than a 3-to-1 ratio, 166 for the Niners, 51 for the Giants. So we're talking about Lynch and Shanahan. They come in in 2017. So they had a lot of success with Jim Harbaugh. Kind of a messy ending for Jim here. Got him through a Super Bowl loss to his brother. And then, you know, you had Jim Tom Sula came in, and Shev Kelly was here for a year, and they really couldn't get it together. but then they brought in Lynch and Shanahan together. So far, so very good. And as you know, you know most of these owners, we travel around. The owners to the general manager to the head coach. We just saw it in Philadelphia. We've seen it this week with San Francisco. It's not by accident these teams win and have the best culture, some of the best cultures in the league. Jones. And he gets taken. Well, he gets rid of the ball. And let's see what they're going to call that because Drake Greenlaw was there. Officials discussing whether his forward progress has stopped or he just flung it away and it's incomplete. So a little discussion going on right now. And nice job of taking things away downfield. Really had nowhere to go. There's the athletic ability to keep the play alive. You see, as you said, our last second just threw it. There's no foul for intentional grounding. It's an incomplete pass and second down. That's a good heads-up play just before he steps out of bounds to throw that ball out of his hands. So second down and 10. 7.41 and 25 on the play clock. 7.41. Now they have to add six seconds to the clock. Thank you. There you go. and the play clock starts at 25. Breida in the backfield. Bellinger is the fullback. Jones slides left, fires, and it's caught. That pass to 30-yard line is taken in there by Breida. Setting up a third down and three for the Giants. He found his fourth option, the check down. Watch the coverage in the back by the San Francisco defense. Take everything away. See that orbit motion taken away, downfield taken away, and his eyes went one, two, three, came all the way. This drive, and I'll tell you, he put this ball up in the air because he trusts Samuel, and it's the second time on this drive he almost throws a pick at time the rookie. The rookie, Banks, taking care of a 28-yard attempt with the third-round draft pick, Jake Moody puts it through. So they have the ball for the first 6-16 of the opening quarter. run 15 plays, but the Giants hold him to three, Jose. Levi Stadium hosted the Super Bowl following the 2015 season. Peyton Manning's last game, Denver beat Carolina. Jake Moody, who kicked the field goal to kick it off. Eric Gray, the rookie from Oklahoma, their fifth-round draft choice back to receive it. Gray drifting over, and it bounds through. So Daniel Jones, very rough start along with all of the Giants for the first 90 minutes, but terrific in the second half last week. Those numbers, great, and of course all of those numbers are good ones coming in the second half. Nine rushes. Also, as you mentioned, Kirk, he can beat you with his legs. Yeah, I think very underrated athlete. He's going to have to do it tonight. Not only design, but also improvise and keep some plays alive. without Saquon in that backfield tonight. It really falls on his shoulders. So the running back is Matt Breida, who came up with the 49ers a few years ago. 49ers show blitz. Here they come. Jones hangs in there, and the pass is incomplete. It'll be second down and 10 for Darius Slayton, covered by D'Amador Lenore, second and 10. Brian Dable felt that not just last week's second half, the momentum that they picked up, and the urgency that their offense played with when they dug themselves such a hole. I think they're also referring back to the Dallas game and how quickly that game got out of hand. And playing another team that has a great defense, I think there's an awareness of how fast they can get after Daniel Jones and how they've got to get the ball out quickly. So great, they rarely blitz. Brita, probing, nice game, picks up about seven, setting up a third down and short. He was with Buffalo for a while with Brian Dable and then Dable brought him to New York. Between Brian Dable and Mike Kafka, think about what this offense is trying to put together. Not only are we talking a lot about Saquon Barkley being out, but this is a makeshift offensive line. Going against arguably the top defensive line in the NFL. And Dable and Kafka have to come up with a plan to try to help Daniel Jones out with that line. Two backups at left guard and left tackle. Four-man rush. Pass is thrown over the middle. And going down is Wondale Robinson to make the grab. Robinson, second-year man out of Kentucky. You saw him a lot in college. Absolutely. The respect that they have for Waller, who's lined up here. Watch the eyes and the change right there. Right away, he looks up. The linebacker, Fred Warner, looks him up. And that frees up a nice opening there on the left side to Robinson, who went down last year in November with an ACL. It's great to see him back so quickly. and he gives him a different gear at that slot spot with his physicality and quickness. First catch for him this year. He had 23 receptions last season. Play action. Protected well, but the secondary doesn't show, so he has to send it to the outside. Caught there by the backup tight end, Daniel Bellinger, for a gain of eight. Offensive line holding up so far. Ball's getting out a little bit quicker, of course, this week because of the respect for the 49er pass rush. That time helping on Bosa there with Isaiah Hodgins, wide receiver. It's going to be a lot of chipping on the edges against Bosa and Drake Jackson. Breida fights his way close to a first down. Appears to come up a little bit short, so it's going to be third down in inches. Bosa is there to make the stop. this offensive line, Andrew Thomas, who's got a chance to be a really good player, a young player at left tackle out. So Joshua Zudu goes from guard. He's a guard. He's playing left tackle. You've got Shane Lemieux playing left guard. Jones is going to keep it himself. Where does the ball wind up in that pile? But as the line judge head linesman come in, down judge spotting it. Across the line to gain. First down. Look at this. It's like a diamond formation. Two tight ends there trying to push. Breida is in there trying to help Bellinger and Waller out. Still not much of a budge. Just enough. Barely. Back-to-back first downs. Jones throws to the outside. That's caught short game. Parris. Playback to the check down. And instead of being third and ten, now you've got a shot. It opens up the playbook here for Brian Dable. Third down about two and a half. It's Darren Waller going into the slot. He hasn't got to pass tonight and won't hear either. The sack. Devon Hargrave, who they picked up in free agency, had a great year last year with the Philadelphia Eagles. another guy they've added to that fabulous front four and this this is the beauty of being in third down and rushing four you don't have to blitz keep talking about the offensive line lemieux is a guy who played some football back in 2020 during the covid year but hasn't played much since and our grave just goes over it Gillen to punt. His last boot was 60 yards. Again, a mile-high kick. McLeod calls for and makes the fair catch back at the 26-yard line. With 6'13", remaining it for a 49-yard boot. 10-3, 49ers. Got to the corner of my eye. You said that this morning. Yeah. You're like, okay. All right, I guess we'll use that. Well done. If you're in med school. From the 27-yard line, they begin this drive. Purdy. And that's incomplete. So Purdy, of course, was the last guy picked in the draft. So he's on a very relatively cheap time. He is by far the lowest paid starting quarterback in the league. He's making a little less than $900,000 this year. We asked him yesterday, I said, are you living in an Airbnb here? He's got a roommate. One of the offensive linemen. And by the way, you're making $900,000. You're not setting up a GoFundMe page for you. Right, right. But I thought it was great to hear him say it's almost like being at Ames back in college. You know, the lifestyle that he has. Living with an offensive lineman, Sharon Rint. 127. Gets off the spot. Caught. And banged forward that time is Elijah Mitchell. He was going to be stopped a little short of the first down. They got hit from behind, but they're going to spot forward progress. Just a little short of it. Yeah, Isaiah Simmons to your right, 19, just hustling to make a play, but he pushed him almost across that first down line. So it's another third down for these guys. Their money on third down tonight, six out of eight, and some of them have been real long. This time third in inches, and McCaffrey has no problem picking it up. And then a stiff arm gains him another five or six yards. Wow. We saw what he did last week to the Rams with that big run that he had. And at the end, that big stiff arm that kind of upset the defensive back. He's doing like a Derrick Henry impersonation here these last couple weeks. That's the rookie, Banks, just throwing him around and picking up more yards. Gain of 12. 49ers have 187 yards and the Giants 51. Mitchell a running back. Mitchell. In the Giants territory. Another big gainer. To the 33 yard line. He goes. Tackled there by Xavier McKinney. First down. Nice job by McKibbitts here. The right tackle. Watch him get around and make a nice block. Also some good blocks downfield. That's one thing about these receivers. They love to make catches. Also hustle downfield, and they turn these good runs into great runs because of what they're able to do against that secondary. They force the corners to make tackles, and they get on the safeties. 18 yards there. Niners have rushed for 79 in the first half. Once again, Elijah Mitchell, third-year man at Louisiana. What's ahead for these guys? Arizona comes here next week, and then Dallas comes to town in Week 5. Giants, meanwhile, they're off for 11 days, and their next game is the Monday night at the Meadowlands against Seattle. And as we mentioned before, Barkley saying that it's a high ankle sprain. Initially, he was listed as just a regular ankle sprain. The high is normally more insidious. We don't know. But he thinks he has a chance to play a week from Monday. Second and nine. Batted in the air. Guard line on first down halfway through the third quarter. Purdy's been on fire on third down. Seven and nine, 112 yards and a touchdown. Kittle to the slot on the right side. Jennings in motion. Look back to the 20-yard line. Of course, they use so much, McCaffrey takes it there. So much motion You know it funny because when Mike Shanahan was coaching the Broncos at one point led him to back Super Bowls the Sports Illustrated called him the Mastermind So this is like Mastermind Junior right Imagine what it was like for him growing up with his dad. There's Mike. Great to see him. Mike and Peggy Shanahan. How proud must he be watching his son? Terrific. With this team and this offense. He put Kyle on his staff. He put Sean McVay on his staff. How'd that work out? Second and six. Eye for talent. Swing it out to McCaffrey. Nice grab. Stiff arms, and that should net the first down. Takes a shot. Out of bounds there. Thibodeau put the pressure on, but it was gotten away. First down. And Martindale doing a good job of mixing up man and zone. There's Thibodeau coming close, but everything's taken away downfield, So he quickly, as Thibodeau is closing in on him, just finds that check down to McCaffrey. First down yardage. It's not a bad check down. Get it to 23. McCaffrey. Go to Kaylee quickly. Kaylee. Guys, this giant secondary is without rookie corner Deontay Banks. He left the field before the half. If we haven't seen him since, we're told he's questionable to return with a right arm injury. So Adoree Jackson moves over to that spot. Darnay Holmes. Now on the sideline. Yeah, when they're in nickel, Darnay Holmes now will work that nickel, and they'll move Adoree Jackson to the outside, where he's more familiar throughout his career with being outside. But it does flip Trey Hawkins now from the left over to the right. McCaffrey. Great tackle. Boy, there is that Micah McFadden. Played his college ball at Indiana. Fifth round pick last year. Having a night. Usually you would see this double team work up to the backers right here. One of them wants to be able to come up and be able to take away McFadden. But because he is downhill so quickly, they're unable to climb. You work at a double team. Climb to the second level. 68 would love to be able to make that block. But, man, McFadden is seeing it tonight. Great play. Third and eight. Five minutes left in the third. Fired over the middle into traffic and incomplete. A flag comes in again. Contact there. Kittle was the intended receiver. They will go, are you kidding? I'm going to have to agree with him here. There was initial contact by Thibodeau, but if they're going to call this on Xavier McKinney, I just don't see the contact. He didn't see the football, but I don't think he hits it. I don't think he touches it. There's a little push there. Now watch McKinney, 29 react. Before the pass was thrown, illegal contact. Defense number five. I'm going to call it on that initial push. And an automatic first down. Terry McCauley agrees with that call. He does not. The prime table does not. That's a gigantic play. Terry, you want to hop on here? Yeah, he clearly pushes him beyond five yards. That's the only good contact. He's got to let him go. He can touch and feel as he goes by, but he can't push or jam as he goes by it more than five yards. It's illegal contact. That was about seven or eight. Yeah, and that was a third and eight play. Now it's first and goal. Toss it back to McCaffrey. Threads his way to the three-yard line. It'll be second down and goal. Pinnock making the tackle. It's not like this offense needs help, right? A couple third-down penalties now to keep this drive alive down in the red zone. A four-yard game. Thibodeau known as a pass rusher, but in this offense, he does drop, even on third down occasionally, just to try to keep the defense guessing. New York is charged at timeout because they had an injury on the play inside two minutes. It does not matter that there was a penalty on the play. Charged timeout, New York, their second. From Ryan Dable and Wink Martindale, they played pretty well, All things considered against this offense, but not able to cash in on those third downs. Regardless, it's the Giants' best first half in the three. Yeah, no doubt about that. But that's worth. First and goal. McCaffrey into the end zone. Touchdown 49ers. McCaffrey now has scored a touchdown in 12 consecutive games including the playoffs and that's on 11 plays, 6 runs, 5 passes and they go all the way in for 73 yards Little double team on the right side Burford 74, McKibbitt goes up to that linebacker right there and that hole opens up so quickly and the way McCaffrey gets downhill, he just does not hesitate. Puts a lot of stress on that defense and he gets it into the end zone. The rookie, Jake Moody, who did not miss a single extra point in college nor in the pros at this point. Bangs it through to make it 17-3. San Francisco. First half. Here he comes. And a fair catch is called for. That's a new rule here as Eric Gray brings him in at the goal line. Number 20 gave a fair catch and caught the ball. The ball was placed at the 25-yard line. I mentioned the minute 40, the one timeout. You and I talked in there just before we came back. They did defer when they won the toss. They will start the second half with the ball. Saquon Barkley, if you're just joining us, not playing tonight. Offensive line, some injuries. This offense has really been challenged to go up against one of the top defenses in the league, especially on a short week. See if they can put something together here. That one timeout. Pass is going out here by Parrish Campbell. Clock continues to run. Gain of a couple. Second down. So much focus on Daniel Jones, but these receivers got to win and get some separation. Over the middle, that's caught for the Louis Shia, the first half. They finally called Darren Waller's number. Fred Warner is there to make the stop. Coming up to the line. He's serving the last time out, third and one. That is no man's land with Fred Warner in coverage. That's caught. Ended up for the first down. They're picking it up in little bites here. Clock down under 50 seconds. Down the sideline. And that's Darius Slayton. He pulls it in and makes the catch and gets out of bounds at the 45-yard line. Lenore covering on the play. So 32 seconds. Dean of 17. Giants trying to get into field goal range for Ganeau. Great job by Breida. The backup running back in for Barclays. Off to the left of the quarterback. Blitz came from the right. He worked all the way back to pick up Greenlaw there on that blitz. Pressure. Caught. And then falling down. And because of that, the clock continues to run. And stoke. From the 38-yard line. Jones. Trying to get him close enough. And it's dropped over the middle that time. Darren Walter. You know, Kirk, it's really simple. The offense hasn't been able to do anything, basically, since that first drive. And they can't get off the field on third down the defense. Killer. Yeah, I mean, those two things have hurt the rhythm and the flow of this game for the Giants. And just a little thing, that previous pass, not that last one, the one before where they completed it to Paris Campbell with that one timeout. Ball's thrown right on the money, and he just loses his footing and unable to get out of bounds. So they have to burn that timeout. It puts a lot of pressure now on Jones to get not just first down yardage, but kill the clock. Third and three. Pressure. Pass too high. Intended there for Isaiah Hodgins. Had a big second half last week. Menorpe covering on the play. For the Giants right now, the line of scrimmage is the 38-yard line. So you'd be looking at about a 56-yard field goal. both those defensive and they're actually Armstead how about that move by Bosa going around Azudu he's got right around him and Jones if he could have held onto the ball just a fraction longer that's probably a completion 57 yards for Graham Gonneau to try to get them within 11 and Gonneau's kick is right down the middle so the Giants with a couple of field goals tonight to make it now 17-6 and as you say, Kirk will get the ball to start the second half it wasn't the prettiest drive but they were able to get at least in field goal range to give Cano a chance and that strong leg and the accuracy right through he's fired up, he's got the two kicks and the Giants as far as what they did last week and the way they fought back I'm sure Brian D'Abel is going to be talking about that. And I know it's a different animal to get on the 49ers, but it's just a belief after you're able to do that. And that's something they've got to talk about, trying to get back into this game. And that field goal helps get the ball to start the second half. Numbers tell the story. 49ers have outgained them 244-88. They've had the ball for 19 minutes and 47 seconds, a 2-to-1 ratio time of possession. Talked about the third down conversions, of course. Jones 12 out of 17, only 91 yards. So a total of only 88 yards on 24 plays for the Giants. About three and a half per play. And the Niners will have it at the 25. Coming up on the State Farm Halftime Show. Carissa with her trained animals. And the boys talking about Nick Bosa. They'll talk about taking away Darren Waller. Tony would know all about that. 30's first half improvements coming up at the half. There they are. The Gang of Five. That's a fun pre-game. I've got to tell you. Pre-half-time, post-game. They've got it all. Dinners, you name it. Well, you got a little action going on here at the end of the half. Trent Williams being walked away. It looked like Trent Williams and A'shaun Robinson got tied up there. Your team stay on the field. He gave him a little... Yep. Stay on the field, please. The half is not over. Watch this little push. 71. Boop. A'shawn came right at him and stops right before. Steps right into him. I think Brian Dable reacting to that left hook by Trent Williams. So the Niners are all ready to go to the locker room. Giants come out of the field. They're still still looking for their sidelines. Six seconds, and Sean Hockley, whose dad was a well-respected Sean doesn't quite have Ed's biceps, but he's, you know. He's working on it. He's working on it. Tough task. There were fouls by both teams on the play. Personal foul, unnecessary roughness, offense number 71. Personal foul, unnecessary roughness, defense number 91. These penalties offset its second down. That's three fouls on Trent Williams tonight. That's kind of a stop the presses thing. And that last one, just unnecessary. You know, half's almost over. Go home. Loses his cool there a little bit. They're going to get A'shaun Robinson off the field for the Giants. Second and 11 at the 24-yard line. so it gives the concessionaires a little extra time to sell their wares their foodstuffs as we get to so if you thought the Giants were going to go belly up tonight you're wrong 17 to 12 may keep the offense back out on the field. Breed looking over to the sideline to try to make it a three-point game. Watch the rookie center, John Michael Schmitz Jr. Good job of affecting Greenlaw, but that's just hard running. I mean, he did not hesitate. Matt Breed had known for his downhill running style and his speed. The former 49er punches it in for that touchdown. Five minutes into the second half. conversion cuts it to a field goal no chance mother stays at five points Eric Armstead and Boceau right there ten minutes remaining in the third at a ballgame 17 to 12 49ers Cano sending it down to Ray Ray McLeod. Start the drive from the 25-yard line. Hurdy tonight, 14 of 24, 157. And the touchdown pass. So Martindale pulling the defensive signals. The 49ers don't have a designated offensive coordinator. Of course, Kyle Coles all the plays. one of the best, if not the best, in the entire National Football League. We were talking about his offense yesterday. We all kind of marvoid how he puts these plays together, pre-snap movement with the motions, the runs, the play action, the way they look so similar. He said, you know, nine years before this, seven here, 16 years, been calling this offense. From the 25-yard line. Start with Purdy. Going deep over the middle, wide open, making the grab. And still on his feet and picking up a lot of extra yardage, Debo Samuel. He finally wrestled him to the ground with the 34-yard line. What a run. Nice job of finding that hole right behind the linebackers on a crosshair by Samuel. So dangerous when you get worried about the run game. They can sneak either Kittle or Samuel behind that offensive line in that run game. Again, the eye candy before the snap. Moving a tight end from the left to your right. Fake to McCaffrey. See the backer who's just trying to get back in position. Goes right over top of McFadden. Four catches, 83 yards. Kirby, this time he's going to get swallowed up and taken down for the sack. Leonard Williams is there. You know, that catch reminded me of Mark Bavaro for the Giants. At Candlestick Park in a game in 1986. Were you calling that game? I called that game. I was going to say. I did. That's why it reminded you. Gary Myers, who's covered the league for a long time, wrote a book called Once a Giant about that 1986 season with Parcells leading him. Bill Belichick was the defensive coordinator. Bavaro played on the team. Phil Simms had a Super Bowl for the ages, and they won the Lombardi. Yeah, that 86 team, they finally had their breakthrough moment with Parcells, and they had to beat the Niners in order to get there. Second down. Long, caught, big tight end, Kittle, takes it for about 13. Again, very similar, the backers out of position. Just the respect you have to have for that run game. Watch the backers react off the play fake. Got the motion, the fake, the backers are up, and there it is again. What's great is how quickly Brock Purdy makes that decision. This is a quarterback-friendly offense when you know where to go with the ball and you have answers. Quick little fake. Backers up. Ball goes right over top of them again for big yards. Third and four. Sliding left. Throwing deep into traffic. No good. Samuel Flegg is down at the 19-yard line. So is there a hold at that spot? He got a hold of the jersey. Darnay Holmes holding on to Debo Samuel on the route. Not at the end of the route, but as he gets to the stem right about there. You'll see the jersey right there. You got the shirt. That was third down and four. Yeah. They were already in field goal range. Now, of course, looking for more from the 24-year-old. End of the kit. First down. Timeout. In their home opener. Trying to go to 3-0 on the season. Drive begins from the 4. Two-yard run here by Christian McCaffrey. Now let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS. And it is Christian McCaffrey. a game that you would expect to see from him running the ball, catching the ball. You see 48 yards of his 61 yards after contact. I'll tell you, I don't know if people really respect how physical of a runner he is involved in the passing game. You see that sniff arm there to finish that one off and has a touchdown. Plus 29 on his scrimmage yards, overexpected. So another great first half. That's messed up right from the start here. I don't know if he ever got the ball. Fortunate to get back on top of that. That's the one way the Giants can get back in this game is a missed you close to your own goal line for Kyle Shanahan in this offense. Of course, third down has been Shanahan's best friend. The ball hits there. I don't think he was just expecting the ball. I mean, it was a good snap. Retained possession. Third down and eight. Pass to the outside. Hold in, but a little bit short. Jennings is there. Tackle made by Darnay Holmes for the moment. Saving the first down. So it's going to be fourth and one. A break of pressure right here. Okara K's walked up, actually, just to the right of that. Sorry. Incomplete. They call it incompletely. Go ahead. Yeah, O'Karake is able to get that pressure. Actually, a pretty good ball. I mean, he's short, even if he were able to hold on to it. See, the ball kind of brings him back short of the first down marker, and that ball ended up coming out. Tight coverage there by Darnay Holmes. See the ball clearly out. So Wisnowski to punt. And the ball is loose. Flag is thrown. Eric Gray was back there 49ers think they have recovered it but we'll see what the flag is about I think he was hit as he was trying to get ready to return the punt looked like it he called for the fair catch as well there's contact right there And Shemar John Charles is the guilty party on this one. So fair catch call for. Contact was made. Fair catch interference. Kicking team number 38. This is a 15-yard penalty from the spot of the foul. First down New York. It's going to be their best field position of the night. Yeah, give them a much shorter field here with 10.46 to go. In the third. sets the bar. Absolutely. Sabrina back in to start this drive from the 37-yard line. Jones fires as an open man. Hits Campbell, gain of seven. Nick Bosa's done a good job of trying to disrupt this offense in a variety of ways. If you could tell, third game back, he's working himself back into football shape. Working through double teams when they chip him. Involved in the run game, keeping him short here of the first down. Here the sack, almost a safety. And I think in this second half, as the Giants become even more and more predictable with the pass, they're going to have to use more than one to try to keep him off of Daniel Jones. Second and three. He has time. Throws down the sideline. Flag thrown. Pass was incomplete. Lenore covering Darren Waller. How about putting Waller a tight end? Not just flexed out, but lined up all the way out as a wide receiver. It gets matched up against a nickel. Lenore also is a corner, and that's just a size advantage where Jones wants to try to put the ball either behind him to make him work back and affect the defender where he has to work through that defender to get the interference or put it up high where the big 6-5 tight end can make a play, but they get the call. 22-yard penalty, first down and goal now from the 8-yard line. And a big hole, and pulling his way is Matt Breida for a touchdown. Bell with Brandon Iyuk out. Ronnie Bell from time to time will be checking in, and he's got a rookie out of Michigan who's got some really great potential, I think, in this system. Samuel lines up outside. All kinds of motion. Kittle comes to the wing on the left. Low snap. No problem for Purdy. Throws. And the catch is made by George Kittle. Kittle obviously for years one of the premier tight ends in the league. He'll haul it in along the boundary. How about Juszczyk right next to him? So as a defense, you're trying to figure out what kind of personnel are they in. And then you have the ability of the fullback to line up as a tight end. Takes that flat away. Nice throw over top of the corner. Going quickly here. Gain of a couple. Mitchell setting up a second down and eight. You know, Juszczyk becomes a defensive coordinator's worst nightmare because of his versatility. Is he a fullback? Is he a tight end? Might they flex him out as a slot receiver? He does so many things within this structure. Right now he's a wingback. They go no huddle. Purdy getting chased. And Purdy flips that one out of bounds. To make it third down and eight. And Brock has started the game four out of ten for 61 yards. Most impressive thing we're seeing here early from this Giants defense is the coverage. You know, you don't see open receivers. Even when he's making throws, he's having to earn it. I mean, the coverage has been tight. They're not busting at all, which you worry about in the short week against Kyle Shanahan's system. because they like to confuse you with all the movement. But, man, Wink Martindale right now has these guys dialed in on the back end. Those two rookie corners doing yeoman work so far. Third down and eight. Pressure. He hangs in there. The pass is plucked. To the 50-yard line goes Jawan Jennings. So they're right on the 50. And it's fourth down. And, of course, the crowd always wants. The home team to go for it. Heck of a job again. Giants getting off the field. Defense that time showed pressure. Walked up. Mug linebacker look where it looks like they're going to bring it. And then pulled back out and played zone. Forced the ball to be thrown underneath. And rallied to the football short of that first down. Minute left in the quarter. Wisnowski to send it down toward the rookie Eric Gray. Gray drifting over. Gray on a hop. Great coverage tackled at the 10-yard line by Ronnie Bell. We were talking about Bell, what he can do offensively, and there he is on special teams with 44 ticks left in the first quarter. Giants 3, 49ers 3. From the 10-yard line, look out! And that's Nick Bosa. And they're going to spot it just outside the goal line at the 1. That's where forward progress was for him before he got smothered. And that's Bosa's first sack of the season, and his first sack going back to last year in postseason in six games. Bellinger's got to get down and anticipate that right there. I mean, the one thing, Bosa doesn't even think and respect the fake at all because he's locked in on setting that edge and getting after the quarterback because we just talked about his athletic ability and how he can get outside. He took it away. Second and 18. Trying to get some space here. Two-yard gain for Breida. And it will be third and long when we come back. It's the end of the first quarter. There you go. Beat Cincinnati twice. Beat Miami and Marino's only Super Bowl appearance. And then Seifert won two. Anyway, just to clean that up. And meanwhile, the Giants are able to provide some space for their punter now on the pass here to Wandale Robinson. It's the third and long. And they'll kick it away. Go back to that punt by Jamie Gillen. And the great coverage by Ronnie Bell. Put them deep in their own territory. The sack by Bosa. Boy, the field has flipped completely here. Jamie Gillen to send it down toward Ray Ray McLeod. Gillen, the Stutzman who played at Arkansas Pine Bluff. Mile high. And perfect. Angled it. Nowhere for McLeod to go. out of bounds at the 28 yards. Through the hole as well as any back in the NFL. Second and one. McCaffrey easily picks up the first down. Still on his feet. Gets inside the 30. Tackled into the 28-yard line by Jason Pinnock. Great effort. One thing about these receivers is they block as well as anybody. You can see the tight ends and receivers helping him out. I feel like the rhythm of this offense tonight is going to start with their running game. Again, a lot of it is depending upon how defenses are defending them. The Giants so far doing a good job on the back end in coverage. But it feels like these running lanes are starting to open up for McCaffrey. McCaffrey out for the moment. Mitchell is in. Heard he goes back into the gun. Play clock is down to three. the fake to the outside goes the pass that's caught there but no room at all good coverage there on Samuel by Micah McFadden Samuel cut back inside to try to get behind some of those linemen that were working to get out there heck of a job of McFadden and the Giants defense just running to the football Wink Martindale wanted to see his defense attack tonight, and I think you're seeing that so far in this game. Second down and 11. Cloud in motion. Swings it to the outside. Coverage is there, and once again, McFadden makes back-to-back nice plays. Caught there by Mitchell. It'll be third down and long. What he does, first of all, good job of being able to avoid Xavier McKinney, who was running that time with Ray Ray McCloud, so he put himself in great position, forces Mitchell back inside, but instead of needing the rest of that defense to get to the football, he's actually able to bring him down. A couple nice plays here by Micah McFadden. Third down, 13. Birdie shoots it out here to McCaffrey. How do you stop him? Takes it inside the 15-yard line on a third and 13. So they've converted two third and longs on this drop first down. And they knew to run this screen back into the boundary where Thibodeau is. They know that pressure is going to be coming. He's coming in fast, so just dump it quick. A little slip screen. And now you get McCaffrey out in space with blockers. Big Cat ran him down from behind. Game within the game between those two minds. You shake in motion. Toss you to McCaffrey. Works his way to the 10-yard line. What a trade that was. Right in the middle of the season, it really helped start things for the 49ers on the right track. Because last year they started 3-4, then they ran the table. John Lynch made that deal with Carolina. Of course, you know, they give up draft picks. They really messed up the Trey Lance thing, so they don't have a lot of top picks. But the Rams proved you can win a Super Bowl without any picks, basically. Right. And, you know, you look at what he brings to this offense. It's the versatility, but it's that home run threat. I mean, every time he touches the ball, you hold your breath. Second and six. McCaffrey. Ooh, and he got slung down a flag because it might be around the neck here. Jihad Ward and the way that McCaffrey went down. Man, he's got to shake his head a little bit here. Ward was fighting off of a double team, just trying to set the edge of that defense. and the ball cuts back. He just throws his right hand up and obviously grabs a hold of that face mask. There were fouls by both teams on the play. Holden, offense number 68. Personal foul, face mask, defense number 55. These penalties offset. Replay, second down. And that's on the 49ers on Colton McKivitts. The right tackle. And they off-step. Brings the ball back to the 10-yard line. And we'll do second and six all over again. Just trying to get up to the second level. And McFadden is working his tail off tonight. Trying to get in position to make a play. And you can see McKivitts got him around the neck himself. And McFadden with a big half. Second and six. Kayvon Thibodeau who's sort of been in a little bit of the crosshairs, didn't make a tackle last week, number one pick last year out of Oregon is there for not only a tackle but the sack. Yeah, and I think Pinnock the safety, Jason Pinnock does a nice job of taking away this throw down field. He wants to get the ball thrown right here to Ronnie Bell and he sinks in coverage and by the time he starts to come off of that, then you see the pressure being pushed up there by DJ Davidson, and then finally Thibodeau cleans it up for that sack. That's the Giants' first sack of the season. They had no sacks, no takeaways coming in. Pass is caught on the fly here by Jawan Jennings, who takes it to the 20-yard line. In a 24 on a third down and 8. 49ers on the move. They love the seams. Third down. He does a good job working into the middle. You can see that seam opens up nicely. just the safety in the middle of the field. He's able to work off that man coverage, get some separation. Ball behind him a little bit. You know, Jennings really known for his physicality as a blocker, but there shows you what he can do with his hands on that nice catch. He becomes the second receiver tonight because IU is inactive. Quickly to the right side. Caught. Gain of eight. McCaffrey. Every time this 49ers offense, every week they get ready to play. Kyle Shanahan, like a lot of people with their script, a lot of formations, a lot of personnel groupings, a lot of different looks because he wants to see how you're going to respond, which will allow him to really start to get into a flow with that next series. He's finding it early here in this game. Tenth play of the opening drive. McCaffrey, and this time he gets tripped up behind the line of scrimmage, setting up another third down play. Leonard, big cat Williams in on the tackle. There's the defensive coordinator, longtime Ravens defensive coordinator in his second year, working under Dayball. I thought he and Brian Dayball brought up a good point, how tough it is to prepare on a short week for this offense. They got the tablet out. They're showing the scout team just how to do this, the pre-snap movement, the motions, all the different things that they bring. And they said, that's the toughest thing, just trying to get ready. Keeps it. Needs a yard. 49ers signal they have it. And so does Sean Hockley, tonight's referee, first down San Francisco. So they've had the ball for the entire quarter to this point, five and a half minutes in. They've run 11 plays for 65 yards. And now it comes down to execution down in the low red zone area. See if the Giants are thinking, listen, the reality is this is one of the better offenses. You're going to give up some plays, give up some yards. Their whole goal tonight in competing and staying in this game is squeezing down in this red zone and forcing field goals. Well, just outside the 10, so they can get a first down without the touchdown. Out of the pistol this time. Purdy. Bies time. Pass is real good intended for Debo Samuel. The one thing, and even Purdy admitted it last week, he was off the mark a lot in the game against the Rams. Yeah, and I think part of that is just, you know, I thought it was fascinating to talk to him yesterday about the procedure that he went through with the elbow and how he, you know, he came out, he started his throw, and he really put it, he wasn't able to throw for a number of months. And then he just kind of gained his confidence back in his arms. I look at Micah McFadden there trying to get himself back onto the field. Second down and ten. Here's the linebacker comes up. The pass is thrown inside the five-yard line and broken up. Debo Samuel with three white shirts around him, including Adoree Jackson. So again, it's third down, and they've converted on third down. Now three out of three. Debo Samuel's a tough guy, but not just on the outside by Adoree Jackson, but O'Karake, the middle linebacker. Good push there by Big Dexter Lawrence. Nice job of getting that. That's what making Purdy want to get that ball off in a hurry. Things can happen a lot faster down here for Brock Purdy in this offense. Now the third down. Bunch to the left. 14th play of the drive. Pressure. Purdy hit as he throws. Broken up in the end zone. So the Giants able to hold. Bobby O'Karake, one of their big pickups during the offseason, played at Stanford, was a teammate of McCaffrey, helping to break it up, and in comes the field goal group. There's Isaiah Simmons right there who picks up the block. It frees up Okereke. And I'll tell you what, for a defense, it's been ridiculed by some of their own fans about where's the pressure. And they dial it up here, not just on this play, but they've been getting some pressure on him. The half. The score, San Francisco 17, and the New York Giants 6. After the break, State Farm Halftime Show coming your way. First drive of the second half and get right back in the game. Yeah, like last week against the Cardinals, they hit Hyatt for that big play to start the second half. It really opened up, seems like, the entire offense and the way they played. Bear catch by Greg. Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit. And let's go down to Kaley Harton. Hey, guys, after dominating the time of possession 2-1 in that first half, Kyle Shanahan told me he's feeling really good about his team, and he feels like they could be going on a roll here. He said we just can't hurt ourselves. 74 is eligible. 74. He said they have got to keep moving the chains just like they did in the first half where a third down was key as we saw. And Brian Dable pointed out that third down was big on both sides. He wants his team to take care of the ball. I asked if he could find a spark like he did on Sunday getting the ball back here. He looked at me, smiled, and said, we'll see. Well, we'll see. We'll start with the running back carrying for a gain of a yard, maybe two. That's Gary Brightwell. You saw Rita starting the game. Brightwell picks up a couple seconds down at eight. And, of course, with Saquon Barkley, you know the run game is going to be impacted. But that first half, and I know they didn't have the ball a lot, but the backs collectively only four carries and 12 yards. So I'm sure Dable looking at that and saying, listen, we don't need to hang our hat on this run game, but we've got to at least show it. Can't become that one-dimensional. second down and eight swing it out room to Rome Brightwell in motion took the swing pass picks up the first down on the game to 13 yeah and giving Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers some of their own medicine here getting him in motion the Niners do not respond nobody runs with him he's able to outflank this defense and he hits him in stride and kind of an extension really of the run game just get it out in the flat and give your back, Brightwell, some space to run. To 40. Brightwell again. Can he turn the corner? No, he cannot. Oren Burks, number 48. Takes him down just about at the line of scrimmage. He's got some range. He's so used to seeing Warner and Greenlaw in there working together. That time, Burks, 6'3", 233 pounds. Showing some good range and speed. That's the tough thing on the Giants. It's one thing to try to put a 10 or 12 play drive together. If they're going to hang in this game, they're going to have to hit some explosives downfield, which is you talk about maybe a Hyatt or a Slayton downfield. Right, as they did last week, the pass to Hyatt was gigantic. Keeps it himself, Jones. But he's dragged down to the 44-yard line. No room to roam there. Dre Greenlaw makes the tackle. Giants third down and seven. Brian Dable talking to me the other day, second year. The Dables have six children. But he's one behind the other New York coach. That's crazy, right? Right? Yeah. The Jets were seven. Third and seven. Jones racing away with good speed. Throws incomplete. Coverage was good. Pressure was put on. Intended for Darius Slayton. So it's fourth down. Nobody able to get off. This is press coverage. Press man. You'll see this off to the right. These receivers. Look at the defensive backs. Just challenging them. Trying to affect the timing. They know how quickly that rush can get in there. They really work together. When they press like that, They're hoping to just make that quarterback hold the ball and allow Armstead and Hargrave and Bosa and Jackson be able to get in there, and that's exactly how it played out. Gillen's punt. Flag thrown. McLeod from the nine. Tackled at the 14-yard line. Cam Brown makes the stop. Get the call from Sean Hockley in a minute. So the Giants start with one first down and that's it. On that drive. During the kick, holding by the receiving team number 35. Half the distance to the goal from... Pulled in by Bell. So the Wisconsin Devo Samuel was hit as he tried to make the catch, and the 49ers get a lucky break. And Dory Jackson makes a great play on the football. We've been seeing this a lot tonight from this giant secondary. Good job. We've seen one of the inside technique there. Samuel coming again on one of these crossers and slants. He gets a hand on the ball, but what a heads-up play by Ronnie Bell. Good job of not quitting on it. Heads up looking for the football and comes down with a nice game. From the 18-yard line. Mitchell again. Boy, I said that Ronnie Bell with Mitchell picking up about 4 or 5. You know, he's getting the opportunity tonight to play more than he would normally because of Brandon Ayuk being inactive. You guys asked me, just because I covered all these college guys about him, and I said, man, they couldn't have handpicked a better fit in the seventh round than they found with Ronnie Bell as far as fitting into the culture. They're pretty good in the seventh round, by the way. They're pretty good. They're pretty good. Second and five. 41 is McFadden. He's at a big half. I think he'll let the clock run down in the two-minute warning. A brace of minutes left in the first half. San Francisco 10 and the New York Giants 3 on Thursday Night Football. Yep. Seventh year out of Iowa. Picked in the fifth round. Second down and five. To the outside, Samuel. Turning the corner, coming up a little bit short of the first down. And you get a flag down. I just love to see McCaffrey anytime you're a high profile back in the NFL you get a lot of carries but this is why his teammates love him look at 23 on the left double teams with Kittle he's got to come back all these guys do this Samuel does it McCaffrey does it just an unselfish bunch and they get a rare hold and a mistake there by the best left tackle in the game he's been flagged twice tonight I think he's trying to say, wait a second, he got me. He just pulls McFadden towards him. McFadden's in almost every play tonight. He's affected. Thank you. Yeah, Trent arguing his case. It's a veteran move. He tried to pull that off, pulling the defender towards him. Falling on his back. At the 21-yard line. Ball back at the 21. Second down and 13. Now you have Samuel in the backfield. Lines up there with frequency. To the outside, McCaffrey. Tackled at the 20-yard line. And again, the Niners with a third down. A big part of what this offense does is they create space in their play-action pass game for yards after the catch. They're the best in the league and have been for a number of years. Think about who you have. Guys like Devo Samuel and Ayuk, who's not playing tonight. McCaffrey, of course. So far, over 100 yards already in this first half with 145 yards they threw through the air. It's a combination of the scheme, the space that he creates in their play-action pass game, and then the talent of the players that they have to work with. Giants took the time out here. The problem with the Giants tonight, they can't get off the field on third down. 49ers are 7 for 9 on third. And again, a couple of them in third and long, as is the case here, third and 12. Four-man rush. Passed court. And Kittle with another flag down. For the moment, it looks like Kittle is just a little bit short of it. But Leonard Williams came in and really laid one on Brock Purdy. And that's going to be the call. Meanwhile, you've got Adoree Jackson in pain. Ruffing the back of it. Defense number 99. The penalty is half the distance to the goal. And an automatic first down. Leonard Williams is one-on-one with Aaron Banks and actually does a really nice job using his hands. I think it's the way he landed on Purdy draws the foul. It was late. It was all his weight coming down on top of Purdy. Mayfield said that's the most fun he's ever had playing football. Most fun we had last year. 46-yard line. is Jordan Mason. It is amazing that you can get a quarterback to play well. How it just creates so much belief. It affects not just the offense, but the defense and the overall vibe of the team. I think Purdy provided that for this 49ers team a year ago. What did Ryan Fitzpatrick say to us today? That Purdy's the third highest paid quarterback in the quarterback room here. Right. What is he? I think 78th highest paid quarterback in the league. Whatever it is. That won't last long. No. First down here for Mason. That's good. First down. 13 straight regular season wins with no more than one turnover. That's crazy. Tonight, no turnovers. Only one turnover in the game. The Giants with the pick. So the victory formation. and that will take us to triple zeros on the clock. So the 49ers go on the road around Pittsburgh. Beat the Rams. Long trip for the Giants. Go to Arizona. At least they pulled out a miracle win to go to one and one. Now they're one and two and get to fly home and Abel gets to walk into his house at 6.30 in the morning with the six kids. Welcome home, Pops. 30-12 is the final score. So hang around for the postgame show. Coming right up to JCPenney postgame show after these messages. When he may be coming, when he may be dropping That would be a complete outside edge player Play action, under pressure, has to throw it away That time coming in was Pinnock It's third down and goal Again, especially the closer you get to the red zone Martindale loves to bring pressure This is where the pressure comes from They're manned up bringing one extra. Good job of anticipating the possibility of him coming and rolling out. All he could do there off that boot was just get the ball out of his hands, throw it away. Another third down here, Al. Well, yeah, that's been the problem tonight. 7 of 11 are the 49ers. The last one, they got the first down on the penalty. Third down and goal. Low snap, no problem. Purdy throws. That's a problem. Incomplete. Pressure that time. Pinnock again. So they send him twice. Puts the heat on and it's fourth down to goal. They walked everybody up and just played zero. Just said, okay, we're going to bring one extra. Eventually the pressure gets here. But look all the way across the board. They're going to bring one more. Purdy knows it's coming. It's just a matter of trying to get a receiver to break free. Kittle, who is trying to get the ball to, just loses his footing. So straight zero. Bring one more than they can handle. and because he lost his footing there, just nowhere to throw the football. Jake Moody, for years Robbie Gole was here, but they picked Moody in the third round out of Michigan where he was phenomenal. And he bangs this one through. Third down goals. That defense was able to stiffen the hole into a field goal. I was going to say, he's working the officials, and he should here, but he's got to be proud of that defense, overcoming the two penalties, to hold by Holmes against Debo Samuel. Kayvon Thibodeau had that illegal contact, and seven plays inside of 20, only gave up three. Gray feels it to four, and it's taken down shy of the 20. We go to Kaylee. Al, Daniel Jones epitomizes what you want to be as a Giant. That's how Leonard Williams described his quarterback to me. When Jones led that 21-point comeback on Sunday, Williams told me those qualities were on display. Jones' grit, his resilience, his determination, and his demeanor. And Darren Waller said, as football gives you the opportunity to ride the roller coaster, Jones doesn't get on the ride. He just keeps plugging at the process. Yeah, you know, you get to know him, and that's exactly what he is. Steady. Not a lot of flash and dash. Pass here, caught by Wondell Robinson for a short game. Feels like a big drive here, not just because, you know, we're under four minutes to go into third, But just as this game, the ebb and flow, the momentum changes that go back and forth. The fact that this defense from New York is able to come up with a stop. Keep it a one possession game. Crowd starting to come alive a little bit. They need to respond here. Three and a half left in the third. known dead full strike tied in off to the left Bellinger for your crowd start to become a bit of a factor maybe the first time all night and 82 right in the middle see that slight clinch one thing Brian table telling us no matter what happens, we cannot get behind the sticks. We've got to stay on schedule with this offensive line that we have against this defense led by Bosa and company. Again, back up left tackle, back up left guard against that ferocious 49er front. And catches made. The 20-yard line Robinson is there. They're taking that right away by Gibson, 3rd and 9. Al, we were looking at film. I thought the thing that we saw last week from the Niners against Stafford and the Rams in the second half, they did this. They brought more pressure. They tightened up the coverage. They took away some of those easier throws. Starting to feel a little bit like last week where so many throws underneath from Daniel Jones. Steve Wolfe's adjustment against Dable is to try to tighten that up and either take the throw away or be right there for no yards after the catch. Third and nine. Jones under pressure. Throws. No good. And flags go down. There's one back at the 13. And there's one up at the 23. Did not turn out. 36-yard field goal. They're trying to put him up by 11. Wisnowski to hold it. High snap, but he gets it down. Pick is good. 12.47 decades. Yes, sir. I know you love these next-gen stats, so I thought we'd give you a look. Powered by AWS. Look at this. Daniel Jones, 2 of 6. Only 7 yards when he's been pressured. Remember, he's an athletic guy. He can get away from it. But when he's been not pressured, you see 14 of 17 good numbers, but only 111 yards, which means fall is out fast. A lot of dinking and dunking. A lot of underneath throws. If they're going to get back into this game, keep saying they're going to have to hit some shots downfield. Just been surprised. We've not seen much of Jalen Hyatt at all. Only nine snaps tonight on the game. Zero targets. 25-yard line. Rush four. Look out. Jones steps away. Flag thrown. And Jones for the moment goes up to the 33-yard line. Both the defensive ends getting in there. Hitting each other. They got in there so quickly. Zudu, the left tackle, looks like he may have grabbed on and possibly held Cleland Furl, who's in the game. Personal foul. Face mask. Offense number 75. The penalty is half the distance to the goal. Replay. First down. Yeah. Joshua. Zudu. Think about this. He's a guard in college. Because Andrew Thomas is out, let's see him grab a hold of the face mask right there. but because Thomas is out instead of putting Pear the backup left tackle Zudu's had to try to get out on the edge these last couple weeks and play that left tackle spot with Thomas down Michigan's second game in a row hamstring first and 22 it's caught up at the 22 yard line by Darren Waller came over from the Raiders second and 13 Hargrave got in there in a hurry. You want to know why he's 14-17 when he's not pressured? Because he's getting the ball out of his hands quickly because a guy that's like Hargrave, watch how quickly he's able to get in. This is like one Mississippi, two Mississippi. Ball better be out. Second and 13. Finds the open man. Very short game here, though. Paris Campbell. Paris Campbell tonight has been his top target. He's caught six, but for 24 yards. That's four yards a catch. Steve Wilks has got to be really proud of this effort and how this is one of the better tackling teams in the NFL. There's just not been much at all after the catch. This defense really playing great out in space. Tie it in the game now at the bottom. Yep. Huge play last week. To get the Giants rolling. Jones fires too high and incomplete. Again, he tries to go Waller's way. Couldn't hold on fourth and 11. They brought pressure. They manned up. And he gets separation. He's able to pull away from Oliver. I mean, you really got to make this play. You got to try to help your quarterback out there. I don't know if he just didn't see the ball till late. He's a big target at 6'5". He'd love to see him to be able to climb and make that play. Frustrating for Daniel Jones. Fifth punt for Gillen tonight. He's averaged 51 per boot. Another good one here from the 19. McLeod runs it back out to again this drive. Look at this again 20 yards. Hebo Samuel. Breaking tackles yards after contact And he pays a little bit of a price here Timeout for injury He is just so tough after the catch So, a little bit of a nervous moment on that sideline. Al Pena walked up, and so even though there's a run play here, watch how he gets off of it quickly. Just gets the ball out to Debo. Debo Samuel makes these guys have to work to bring him down. Kerake, I think, finally cleaned that up. Danting Debo, Debo, injury timeout. Catch. He's fine now for at least one play. 49ers first down at the 49 yard line Kittle he fights his way for three extra yards Pinnock making the tackle he saw the check there he saw he had his big tight end isolated one on one against his safety in Pinnock we saw it against Xavier McKinney earlier they're bringing pressure, gets the ball out in a hurry. All you've got to do is get it out there to these guys and give them a chance to be one-on-one and let them try to fight through those arm tackles. Man, he is a handful to bring down. Mismatch against the safeties. Not easy to bring him down, Samuel down, McCaffrey down, you name it. Sooner or later, you check, you knew, would get into the mix. He does everything. You've got to let him get his hands on the ball once in a while, right? Gave him a little candy right there. A little candy. You feel that coming. Yeah. And the crowd's elusive with a huge chant. He is a dying breed to see a fullback in an offense anymore. And 44 is a throwback. Fun to watch him. So many different alignments. So much is asked of him. Not just to be physical, but he lines up in various positions. Now he's lined up off to the left, almost like an H-back or a tight end. That was his first carry this year. McCaffrey to the 36-yard line. Kaylee, what you got? Yeah, guys, Kyle Juszczyk is kind of like a Mr. Fix-It for this 49ers offense. And now that he's in his seventh season with Shanahan, Juszczyk told me if anything goes wrong on a play, if anyone misses an assignment, he said, I can make it right because I see it all unfold in front of me. Christian McCaffrey told me Juszczyk has the intelligence and the athleticism to play any position on the field. And he's one of the most impressive guys he's ever played with. Went to Harvard. Not that it makes you automatically brilliant, but just throwing it as a point of information. Just saying. Second and six. McCaffrey. A two-yard shot of the first. Third down. To have McCaffrey and Juszczyk back there to play off of Caley's point, just in case there's a late movement by a linebacker or a safety, you don't quite have time to make the check, whether it's the line or the quarterback. Those guys clean that up. So it's the intelligence to go along with all the pre-snap movement and the things that they do that really stress out a defensive coordinator and most notably the linebackers in the safeties of these defenses. Samuel is back in the backfield. 32. Pass reaching for it and it's pulled in by McCaffrey and they'll spot it right on the yellow line. It'll show us what normally means a first down, obviously. As you know, we've told you for 38 years, it's unofficial. How about Samuel and McCaffrey? Sometimes I wonder if Kyle just does this just for fun. You know, they just switch roles. Samuel, as you said, Al is in the backfield as a running back. And McCaffrey runs routes like a receiver, so he didn't even motion out there. They just lined him up out there. They just switched spots. You know the cliche, so many weapons. He's got them, and he uses all of them in different ways. McCaffrey. Two or three yards next to Lawrence. making the tackle there. So the Niners tonight have had the ball for over 36 minutes. The Giants 17, so that's better than a 2-1. 3.95 to 1. 83 in yardage, it's close to 3-1. Time of possession, we told you, 36 to 17. Everywhere you look, 8 of 14 on third down. numbers like that you would think it would be more than an 11 point game. Right. Second and eight. Pressure. He caught. Samuel. Touchdown. They blitz and get burned. 27 yards. Hockley just sorted out. There were fouls by both teams on the play. Holding offense number 60. Before the pass was thrown, holding defense number 26. These penalties offset. It's third down. And there's McKeithen and Isaiah Oliver. And back we go to third down and nine. He played tight man to press man. You get it again. Waller down at the bottom. Jones. Deep. Turning around and incomplete. threw it to the outside of Waller could not hold in his fourth down and they motioned him to get him stacked to give him a free release off the ball you kind of felt they might go to him Oliver's at nickelback undersized he's got a little bit of space now you just want the ball up in the air where Waller can try to adjust back to the ball they got an interference on that call earlier this time no go Jamie Gillen he'll punt Ray Ray McLeod back to accept it McLeod Colstorpe makes the fair catch thing about Brock is everything off the football field but this is impressive his folks are here as well tonight 31 yard line they begin this drive after they take a time out before the first play of the drive pass is caught Kittle had to reach down for it picks up about eight his parents of course last year when he started to become the guy for this offense of course his dad his mom right there they were seen quite often as Brock was making big plays for this offense and became one of the big stories in the NFL it's an unbelievable story I mean you get picked dead last something like Tom Brady at least went in the sixth round right second and two. Good run here. You know, it's interesting. He's the last pick in the draft and his backup was the number three pick in the draft. That's what I was going to say. I think there's more to it, not just where he was picked, but what he came into. You know, with Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance, who at that time looked as the future. And he comes in and now he's the guy. Well, I'm talking about Sam Darnold, who's the backup. backing up Purdy right now. So Darnold, again, with the Jets. John Lynch is there, of course. It's funny, if you are at the end of the draft, are you sitting there hoping you'll get drafted last, or do you want to be a free agent and look around and maybe get three or four or five offers? Yeah, and he said, you know, who knows where he ultimately would have gone if he were a free agent, but he said he just wanted, he looked at it, it's hard to imagine this now that he's a starter, but he looked at it like numbers. Okay, somebody has a one and a two. I want to go in, maybe make the practice squad, maybe be that third guy. That was his goal when he was coming out, and then he ends up getting drafted by the 49ers, and then he just decided to come in and battle. Yeah, he said they were in the mix in terms of free agency had he not been selected. But it was funny because, you know, look, they mortgaged a lot to get Trey Lance, did not work out. He got traded this year to Dallas. Garoppolo was here. So, you know, it was enough just to make the squad. Well, it's been a fun story. I think he fits into what Kyle Shanahan does. You know, you could put him in some other offenses. I don't know if it would work. He's not the tallest guy. He doesn't have the strongest arm. But with this system, the structure of it, What they ask of him to do pre-snap. Super intelligent guy that knows where to go with the football. And just an extension of Kyle Shanahan and what he likes to do. Rakeem Nunez-Roches needed assistance to get to the sideline here. Play resumes on the first and ten. That's it. Up to the 48 in the waning moments of the third quarter. another Giants player down and that's DJ Davidson so back to back plays Nunez Rochas and Davidson he's in agony right now I just happened to watch Brock Purdy because he was going to get pressured as he releases this ball he just kind of turns away because of that pressure. Thibodeau off to the right. Pocket collapses. He just kind of turns away. Probably thought he had maybe a chance at it, but put it where Samuel could beat Jackson for the football because he got it out early. A little stutter and go. Ball to the outside, and Jackson never locates it. Extra point is good. A little less than six to play in the fourth. Another big night for the 49ers, 30-12. In September, we'll be there. We were there last year when it was. Yes, we were. We were talking about Mark Bavaro before of the Giants back in 1986 on Monday Night Foox. is incomplete. So we bring that up because we saw Debo Samuel do that same sort of thing. Kittle does that same sort of thing yards after the catch. The only difference is he's carrying Ronnie Lott. Right, exactly. What year was that for you on Monday Night Football in 86? First rookie year. Oh, he sounded great. With Frank Gifford. Sounded like a kid. Second to ten. Short game. Ooh, and pays the price. Still flag chums in. Slayton made the catch of Arius Ward and Greenlaw both there. Cut it on Greenlaw. Play is over. He's already wrapped up, and Greenlaw gets a cheap shot in on him. Here it is again. Here's Greenlaw coming in. You've got Ward wrapping him up. Yeah, whistles blown. Yeah. Comes in and it's an unnecessary play. Personal foul. Unnecessary roughness. Defense number 57. This is a 15-yard penalty added to the end of the play. It's first down. We haven't called Greenlaw's name much tonight. He is an outstanding linebacker, but he's probably tired of not being able to hit anybody. So he said, I've got to get in on something. But it makes a mental error. Traverius Ward went down after the contact. He's going to stay on the field, but you wonder if he took maybe a little bit of that hit himself. Yeah, a little bit of friendly fire for the former Kansas City Chief. Up to the 43. Hyatt promotion came to the slot Jones throws and that should be enough for a first down that's Slayton that time with Ward covering on the play That's a really good Greenlaw looks like he's going to be able to get up Again Daniel Jones working with a rookie center backups on the left side of this offensive line and he's been getting pressured all night. Here he is sitting in the pocket under that blitz, just kind of steps up, feels his way, and able to keep his eyes downfield, eventually find a receiver working back to the football in Darius Slayton. And no Saquon Barkley tonight. So we mentioned early on, Saquon saying that he has a high ankle sprain. Normally when you hear high ankle sprain, it means several weeks, But he says, hey, it's not that serious. You and I saw him last night when we left dinner. I mean, he made it almost sound like, man, I was close to trying to go possibly this week. And we said, well, you've got the extended time now. So hopefully his next game, maybe he'll be ready to go. Yeah, Brian Davo, we were talking on Tuesday. So what do you do without Barkley? He goes, hey, wait, don't rule him out yet. Different, obviously, completely different offense without 26 back there. Jones, Creston Low throw, caught Nice catch, but not a lot of room here From that breeder Nick Bosa that's on Got into the offensive backfield They haven't been able to run the football At all Tonight, and I think they knew coming in It would be tough, only 25 yards And once they got behind Put even more On Daniel Jones in the pass game The problem is they can't get the ball downfield. Brian Dable last year, of course, took over. Came from Buffalo along with the general manager, Joe Shane. Not much was expected of the Giants last year, but they made the playoffs. hopes for a little higher this year. You can see some of the tempers down there still with A'shaun Robinson and Trent Williams. Remember, near the end of the first half, that battle seems to be going on. So still working on him as you look at Joe Shane. So they came from Buffalo. Dable had been interviewed by a few teams in the past, spent as Davidson holds his shoulder. He was on Bill Belichick's staff. He had two different stints in New England. He was there at the right time. Five Super Bowl rings. Missed one, though. And you know. Of the six. He won a national championship at Alabama. He did. John Marichorce has been the longtime president and CEO of the New York Giants. He's got all those kids. He needs rings for everybody. Everybody gets a ring. You're talking about six kids. Robert Sala, the Jets coach. Seven kids. Second to nine. Passed off by Kittle. Stiff arm stays inbounds. Turns into a big, big game. Stiff arm McKinney right out of the play. It's so physical after the catch. We keep talking about what they do as a team. with Debo Samuel and George Kittle, 6'4", 250. Well-thrown ball. Look how he's holding the football there. As long as he's got that stiff arm, who cares how he holds the ball? He protects it there right before he gets hit. Came off. Nunez Roaches came off. They will lift Niners down. Begin with a first down here. Nice move by Purdy to avoid. A sack incomplete. Trying to thread it in that time to McCaffrey. There was McFadden again. in on the coverage, and he got another flag down at the... Before the pass was thrown, holding defense number 37. A five-yard penalty and an automatic first down. Around the 20-yard line, so the 18th, Trey Hawkins. Yeah, Hawkins teamed up there with Ray-Ray McLeod, and this loss where he was, McCaffrey doing so many things for this offense, just kind of a rail route matched up against McFadden thought he might finish that play for the touchdown McFadden once he gets a step on you you don't have much of a chance there but just unable to hold on but they do get the defensive holding penalty there on Hawkins 49ers living inside the 20 tonight it's their fifth trip to the red zone two touchdowns two field goals and then they lose two here Mitchell stop by there he is McFadden and all over the place, especially against the run. 49ers offense, so tough to defend. Movement, all the different ways they attack you, how balanced they can be. They're solid up front. They have so much skill. If you don't get confused with the pre-snap movement, you actually happen to be in position. Imagine trying to cover and then tackle guys like Kittle and Debo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey. Second and 12. Good tackle there. Mitchell making the grab, but Darnay Holmes did not let go of him, so it's third down. It's a great look at it. Instead of playing man down here, which they typically do this time, they do not react to the motion at all. Watch the coverage just kind of sit back, trying to keep everything in front of them. You can see a quick reaction off to the left there by Darnay Holmes. So with Banks out, Hawkins moving over. Dory Jackson moves to the other side from nickel out the corner. And Darnay Holmes has stepped up. Playing well since he's been inserted. Daybo loved it. Third and 17. Pass is caught. Kittle gets back to about what was the original line of strivage at the beginning of this sequence. So it's back to the 18-yard line. It's fourth down. And in comes Jake Moody, who is the highest-drafted kicker in years. Last time a kicker was drafted that high, Roberto Aguayo went to Tampa Bay and lasted about 20 minutes. Didn't turn out very great. College kicker at Florida State. No chunk plays. Look out. Owen Burks is right there to stop that play in its tracks. And for Giants fans who might be upset with Brian Dable or Daniel Jones, the reality is you've got an offensive line that can't hold up. The ball's got to get out quickly. And so in the style of defense that the 49ers are playing, they're smart. I mean, they do their homework. They understand that the defensive line's going to win. They're sitting back trying to keep everything in front and make the Giants have to drive the field. Third and 17. batted up volleyball picked off at the 40 to midfield I'm telling you I think that ball got in there to Waller and it would have been there was a lot of traffic it would have taken a heck of a focus but you'd expect to see Waller fight for this football we saw a ball earlier where he is unable to get up to make the play. But this slant to the Jones' right, it gets in there. I think it just goes off of his hands. And then Fred Warner hits the ball. It goes straight up. Then Hufanga, who is known for his physicality. Look at this ball. I mean, that gets in there. You've got to fight for that. In hockey, two guys would get assists. Talanoa Hufunga with the interception from the 48-yard line. Take some time off the clock now to the 50-yard line they go. Elijah Mitchell takes it for a game at two. So the Giants go home. Fly home. Get in in the wee hours. Back to Jersey. Giants will take a time out here. Niners stay home, meet Arizona here a week from Sunday. Brock Purdy is still working his way back from the injury last year in the NFC Championship game. And just feel like he's getting more and more in sync with this offense and what he's going to be asked to do this year. He's gotten some pressure. You've got to give the Giants some credit for what they've done and the way they've mixed things up with Wink Martindale. but here in the second half they've kind of settled in and it's been a combination of some passing, some throwing and a lot of yards after the catch Mitchell on a second and eight to the 46 yard line he goes and we third down talk about the 49ers playing the Cardinals think about their next three Cardinals, Cowboys, Browns Cardinals without Kyler Murray the Cowboys now with Diggs and then the Browns with Nick Chubb So yeah, they will step on digs. They did the Cowboys torn ACL hmm Huge loss up at the top there Just turned his ankle right there See what you saw Evan Neal there he is this is just with the Giants need the left side is banged up Now you got the right tackle Doesn't look serious though at least First will they get Thomas back? He's got 11 days for him to get back I would argue that as much as we keep talking about Saquon Barkley, and he's obviously one of the premier backs that the league has, but Andrew Thomas, that left tackle spot, that hamstring, if you can get him back, I mean, it could just settle things up front. Right now they're doing the best they can to hold on. It's a patchwork deal. working on everybody on the sideline third and five Mitchell and why not McCaffrey doesn't like to come out of the game ever but you know in a situation like this You don't need him in this situation. So Mitchell gets plenty of work. Frustration building on the part of, well, the Giants in particular, but the Niners are doing their best efforts to keep it going. You know, the game, I think, all of us as NFL fans have circle. Week 13, rematch of the NFC Championship. This 49ers team in Philly against the Eagles. And with the injury today to Diggs in Dallas, it's still early. It's only third week. But, man, we saw Philadelphia a week ago. We've seen the Niners this week. Two of the best in the entire league go head-to-head week 13. Well, the Niners will, in all likelihood, win their 15th of their last 16 home games. It's funny. This place opened in 2014, so it's year 10. they didn't have a lot of success here for like the first seven or eight years but recently they've been almost unbeatable at home Wisnowski Bounce out of bounds at the five yard thing you know thinking about our old buddy John Madden let's go back in time a little bit okay now we're going to see right here this is Ernest Gray here And we're going to start. He's going to come down. He'll get behind. He'll get a bump here. He'll get behind. Just work into this area here against the zone defense. Get between it. Catch the ball here. Break. And get all the way in for a touchdown. Very well done. We think that's the first time the telestrator was used by the great John. Yeah, I mean, I love that telestrator, but here's our telestrator now. I mean, that's pretty amazing to think that John Madden got that started, and now here we are with analysts today using Intellistrator very similar to this. Every one of them. Tyrod Taylor is now in at quarterback. So Jones is done for the night for the eight-yard line. Yeah, but you've got to throw in the booms and all the sound effects. Spent seven great years with John. Oh, my, that was a treat. I think he changed the game completely. No question. Created a new template for how you do the game. Second and eight. Taylor. Now to the ten. Third down. Furrow. Making the stop. Lions at Packers next week. Each comes into the games on Sunday. One and one. Ted Ernie's 13th year in the league. Avoids the sack, which a lot of people wanted to see him take. Or at least a girl on one side of, you know what I'm talking about. Four, four, four. We do know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Boy, it's Hargrave, incredible addition to this defensive front. Bosa gets so much attention. Drake Jackson on the other side really coming on in his second year. John Lynch continuing to invest in that defensive line, and it's paying off. You'll win his sixth punt of the night. McLeod. Wiggles his way out to the 50-yard line. With one second to the two-minute warning. Okay, so checking out the near Jets. He was going to be the future. Did not turn out to be the case. Was with Carolina. Signs here as the backup. He could have made a lot of money going elsewhere. But I think it's important with Purdy. 49ers, quarterbacks, and the history of getting hurt. It's great to have him. All right, the watch list. Patriots, Jets is the big early game on CBS. Bears in Kansas City on Fox in the late window. The Sunday night game on NBC is Pittsburgh at Vegas. Sealed is coming off that wind the other night. Vegas trying to get healthy again. Philadelphia and Tampa Bay, one of the two Monday night games. Bengals Rams the other. And there you have it coming up the watch list for this weekend. We can also tell you, stay tuned after the game for the JCPenney post-game show exclusively on Prime Video with Carissa and the gang. Kaylee interviewing the player of the game, Debo's big night. And Purdy tonight, 25-37 for 3-10 and two touchdowns. How about Baker Mayfield? Right. How about bringing some energy and getting Tampa Bay to believe? Well, we saw him last year. That was our most exciting Thursday night game when the Rams came from behind. Mayfield showed up 48 hours before the game. Sean McVay, you know, gave him a cram course, and he led that late drive at the end of the game to win it.
