 And this time, the Jets are starting to move back. Got two flags, in fact. You have three flags. First of all, unnecessary roughness defense, number 44. That 15-yard penalty will be enforced from the previous spot. Automatic, first down. That's Jamie and Sherwood who's playing tonight a lot because C.J. Mosley is out. He's right here. He lowers that head and makes contact there. The officials, two different officials came in. Man, that's a hard call. You know, it is. That is a bang-bang play. And as a defender, you're sitting there saying, what am I supposed to do? Yeah. I mean, he lowered his shoulder. He led with his shoulder. but it's the first down halfway through the quarter little flip here to Demario Douglas breaks a tackle takes it to the midfield stripe and close to a first down little misdirection they used Gibson there to fake almost a, looked like they were going to run that to the right, got Caden Wallace the left tackle out in front and a rare opportunity to be able to get a running back with some speed out into the open space. Be able to try to make some people miss. Second and inches. And you saw the alert. And the alert gets to him. That time it was Chuck Clark. The run on the field is the forward progress to stop. Third down. Well, we circled him. You saw it. It was Clark, and indeed he comes in. He's almost untouched, and the forward progress was stopped, and thus the play was whistled down. Third and eight. You know, with Jordan Whitehead to Tampa, Chuck Clark, who was out last year with an ACL, just kind of working his way to feel more and more comfortable. I thought he did a heck of a job of sitting way back and disguising when that pressure was coming. With the motion that time from Hunter Henry coming from the right to the left, it would have been great with the alert from the offense to be able to see that, to be able to pick that up, either the back or the tight end. Henry's got to pick that up. Clark's first sack in three seasons. Third and nine. Going deep and incomplete. And contact is there. Three more flags come in, as if he couldn't tell. Tyquan Thornton, the intended receiver. D.J. Reid, who missed last week's game, was inactive for the game in Tennessee with a knee injury, and this is going to benefit the Patriots. Very physical. He grabs onto the hand. The flag didn't come out there. He grabbed onto that arm, and sometimes you can get away with that, but then he gets physical towards the end there with the body, and I think once Thornton went down, that's when the flag came in. The officials have eyes everywhere. That's the second penalty in a row with three flags came in. For emphasis, 34-yard penalty. Patriots in dire need of a break and got one there. Six minutes to the half. Again, the alert. He comes in, but he comes in from the other side as well. and nothing but green shirts are there. And Will McDonald. Will McDonald, last year, the number one draft choice, picked 15th overall out of Iowa State, comes off a hat trick last week and one and a half tonight now. We know his potential. He used to just be a speed, outside edge guy as a rookie, and I think he's really developed like most guys do in their second year. And with Jermaine Johnson down, he's got to become a complete football player. He is stepping up here tonight, making some big plays. Little flip here. No room to roam. Gibson is tackled. Sherwood makes the stop. It'll be third down and 18 for New England. We talked how this is a defense that usually doesn't blitz. They rely on the front. But boy, they have come out tonight against this inexperienced offensive line and decided to crank up the pressure, get after them, set the tone, and it's really worked out. Jeff Ulbrich, the defensive coordinator. Of course, Salas Pedigree is defense. He was the D.C. at San Francisco before getting the job here. Third and 18. Quick throw to the outside. And spinning his way to the 24-yard. idea. Not necessarily we're predicting who's going to blitz. It's really more what the quarterback has to be aware of. The alert of the pressure of where it might come from. And you could see that time the alerts were dead on with that pressure from the Jets. Jets now have Braylon Allen in the backfield. The 20-year-old rookie, so the oldest player in the league. Rodgers is under center, and the youngest player in the league is right behind him. Youth must be served. I'll say. Gain of 10. And Trav loves it. He was great last week. Two touchdowns. Broke away from McMillan that time. First down. Out of the first series, we saw a lot of empty. We saw a lot of three receiver looks. They come out here this first snap with the big back. But along with that, they go with 13 personnel with the one back and three tight ends in front of him. So they go from spread to try to challenge you with Aaron Rodgers to coming back and playing power football with the big back Braylon Allen with those three big tight ends. Three years at Wisconsin for Allen. Fourth round draft choice. Again. Takes it to the 45th. It's a pretty good combo platter they are going if Allen can do what we think he can do and re-saw back there. Yeah, I saw Braylon Allen a lot at Wisconsin. And like you said, he is a big back and I think still learning about his size at 235 and learning to be a physical downhill pounder. It would be a great complement to what Brees Hall can do. I saw what Brees Hall can do last week against the Titans spreading out wide and catching a football very elusive. Can be powerful in his own right. But, yeah, I'm with you. Both of those two together, healthy could be dangerous. Sets up deep in the backfield on second down and five. Rodgers rolling and looking and throwing and completing in a first down and fighting for some extra yardage Jeremy Ruppert the number two tight end first down New York that's the beauty of running the football you can affect the eyes even of a disciplined defense like this defense right here he goes in motion and comes back and then he'll work out into the flat you run the ball a couple times You start to get into that big, powerful look for that defense, assuming that it's going to be a run. And Nathaniel Hackett one step ahead, going the other way with that play-action pass. Rucker was targeted three times at Tennessee last Sunday, but did not have a catch. That's his first of the season here. Paul is back in the backfield. He flares out. He makes the catch. But right there to throw him to the ground and draw that flag is Jelani Tavai. So Tavai was right there, read it beautifully, made a nice play, and then too much. I tell you, if I'm a Jets fan... After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, defense, number 48. That 15-yard penalty will be in close to the end of the run. Automatic first down. Remember, Jawan Bentley is the leader of this defense, and he's out with the torn pec for the year, so they turn into Devy to kind of become that leader, and he body slams Hall. The thing that I like if I'm a Jets fan is here's a new guy in the team, John Simpson, comes right over to defend his guy. We never saw that from the Jets' offensive line last year, and I love to see offensive linemen coming in to take care of their skilled players. That's nice by the big man. Simpson, fifth year, another guy who came over from Baltimore, as did Moses, the right tackle. Hall stays in the backfield So he cans it New England adjust their coverage And the changeup leads to a run through the middle And a nice little hole And close to a first down goes Brees Hall You're going to love this Little combination block with the right guard Barrett Tucker comes down, helps, and then climbs up to the second level. This is what you love to see with a new offensive line, still getting familiar with one another, being able to communicate, a lot of different looks from New England, come down a little chip to help kind of solidify that front line and then work up to the second level to Raekwon McMillan. Berset on the sidelines. Rodgers leading this drive with play action, has time throws along the sideline no, out of bounds Garrett Wilson on the chalk covered by Christian Gonzalez it'll be second down and ten but this is the matchup we all flag is down for the moment on the extra point which was good and it's against the Patriots so you could go for two but I think they'll settle for it the way it looks right now settle for the one with eight and a half to go here's Hussey Unsportsmanlike conduct, leverage, receiving team number 23. The New York Jets have elected to put that 15-yard penalty on the kickoff. Okay. All right, unsportsmanlike conduct. Here it is again. It's Duggar. Elevates. That's the call. We're talking a lot about the Jets here. How about New England? This game could not have gone this way. They've been controlling kind of the tempo of games these first couple weeks, and they beat Cincinnati, battled last week, and now tonight game's gotten away from them. They've just not built offensively to get into these kind of games. You know, we talk about Rodgers and the fact he loves the process. He loves to build the foundation. He says, I love Monday through Saturday, this week Monday through Wednesday. It's such in contrast that Brett Favre covered a ton of his games, and Brett toward the end of his career said, I can play the 60 if I only played the games. I don't want to practice. I don't enjoy it. It's the reverse. Yeah, Brett wanted to, you know, practice as quickly as he could and then go out and play nine holes. Yeah, exactly. Well, here with Aaron Rodgers, you can just see him. Here they are 14. He goes right over, and he's starting to look to see, you know, adjustments that they might need to make. They got 193 yards of offense, almost 17 minutes time of possession. Patriots have 12 yards of offense here in this first half. So that's just caught inbounds. Hasty brings it up to the 24. They figured with the 15 yards, they'd have to take a chance on covering the kick, and it almost bounded out. We have seen Nathaniel Hackett mixing up the formations, personnel groupings. Of course, Aaron Rodgers has been on fire tonight, 12 of 14. Really good job showing the athletic ability and the fact that the Achilles has recovered. Jets fans are excited to be able to see him back there. It's just a little bit of everything. The yards after the catch have been impressive. 113 yards after the catch of 135 yards. A lot of that's his accuracy. And a lot of that is these guys breaking tackles from would-be tacklers. First out here. And a run to the outside. Stevenson tackled there by D.J. Reid. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, you saw the Patriots safety, Jabril Peppers, limp off the field earlier. He was in the blue medical tent for eight and a half minutes, and now we're told he's questionable to return to the game because of an ankle injury. But by all my observations, he's right in the middle of the secondary as they game plan for their next turn on the field. Yeah, they sure don't need that because they're minus Bentley already. And, of course, Judon got traded to Atlanta. We've got Stevenson now breaking a tackle. There he goes toward midfield and dragged down at the 47-yard line. And the flag is down. And the Patriots are starting to. Well, they're hanging around for the moment, hoping it's on the defense. However, here it is again. Well, there's the flag. Personal foul, face mask, offense number 38. That 15-0 penalty will be enforced from the spot of the foul, second down. That's a pinky around the mask. Just when it looks like you finally, finally get an opportunity to take a step forward. They went into that jumbo look with Zach Thomas, that extra offensive lineman. and they went heavy to the right, and they double teamed, and he found it. He was patient. He found a hole. Not only does he get a face mask, but now he's on the sideline with the trainers checking him out. Raining and pouring right now on the Patriots. Offense, defense. They bring in Antonio Gibson. Had a big game Sunday at Tennessee. Comes in here after the face mask on a second down and nine. and Berset will fire and that will be not caught and another flag comes in after the incomplete the crowd wanted a late hit there on Mike Williams you see 15.5 average per catch so he's the home run hitter To the outside, an incomplete. So the secondary does its job deep. Has to settle for a hole. Duggar covers on the play. Second and ten. I think the big thing that DeMarcus Covington, the defensive coordinator, his first year as a coordinator with Gerard Mayo, he said, you know, you're going up against Aaron Rodgers. The big thing that we have to be able to do is post-snap movement. If he knows what you're in, you're dead. And it's been very, very tough tonight because you've seen Rodgers in this groove and feeling good, seeing the field very well, but that was one of the few times tonight where they were able to do some movement late, and I think it impacted the rhythm and the flow that time of Rodgers and the receivers. Four-man rush. Rodgers surveys. Rodgers going for it all and throws that one out of the back of the end zone. So again, that secondary minus Peppers at the moment doing its job. And Aaron pleading his case with Hussey. One and a penalty won't get one. Third and ten. I think he saw some contact downfield. I think that's what he was frustrated about. Still talking to the officials. There is no intentional ground. He's number 18. The ball went over his head. down. Got that one timeout with 14 seconds left. But if you keep it in the field of play, you can't spike it. Because it would be fourth down if you don't get at least 10. And nobody knows that better than Aaron what he has to do. End zone or sideline. Everything else, dangerous. He's been here before He knows Third and ten And now you've got timeout By the Patriots First charge timeout New England This will be a 30 second timeout The Jets offense And called the T.O. Deeper insights with Prime Visions A.I. Running around with all the rats that Mayor Adams is trying to get rid of. Third down and ten. Rogers to the outside, and that's incomplete. So it's fourth down, and that's going to bring in Zerline to try to make it a two-touchdown advantage. So the pass were able to stiffen that time. and Greg Zerline 13 years in the league he kicked one of the most clutch field goals you think about Vinatieri and the 44 yarder in the snow with the Rams in overtime like a 60 or 61 yarder to give them the road to the Super Bowl otherwise New Orleans that day probably had a first down or two where they go to the Super Bowl Zerline And this time he misses. So Greg Zerline at the end of that drive can't tack on three, and the Jets settle for an 11-point margin. It's like the snap to hold pretty good. He just misses this. He's hooking that to the left so the Patriots catch a break here. We're thinking about trying to stop Rodgers from putting six on the board, Then they settle for three, and they end up getting out of here down 14-3 compared to how this first half felt. Getting the ball to start the second half, that's probably a win for New England. Yeah, they get the ball to start the second half. And with seven ticks left. Percet's going to throw and they're going to try to call a timeout here and do something I don't know what Demario Douglas made the catch second charge timeout New England with the inexperienced offensive line from New England starting a rookie making his first start at left tackle you got a rookie at right guard the Jets usually rely on their front four to get the pressure but you can see here's Chuck Clark coming I mean, they brought in a number of different blitzes. Even the blitz here from the left frees up, gets an opportunity for McDonald to get in there free because of the coming off of Achilles right here in this stadium a year ago. He's bouncing around looking pretty good here on this opening drive. Absolutely. It was a pretty fast rehab that he had. In fact, he even thought about, had they been in playoff contention, him coming back before the end of last season. Rodgers under pressure. Down he goes. He is sacked at the 41-yard line. Dietrich Wise has been around for the last eight years. Fourth-round pick back in 17. Takes him down for a sack. So with a penalty and a sack, it's now going to be second and 26. You'll see this a lot tonight. Some games, what they like to do is stunt, move around from inside to outside. That time Uche moved from the outside in and affected the offensive line. Remember, you have three new pieces up front. Two on the left side in Simpson and Smith, still feeling each other out and trying to communicate and understand that. At times, Patriots, hey, better get in there and get that pressure. Second and 26, tries to pick up a few on the ground with a run to the 49-yard line. Goes Brees Hall. They set up third down in long eight. They brought in two veteran tackles. You have Smith, who came up with the Cowboys 14 years ago, as a guy who was going to be great and has been, And Morgan Moses, his 11th year, got him from Baltimore. Yeah, and you throw in Simpson at left guard, and really Elijah Vera Tucker, the right guard, who was a former first-rounder, he went out with an Achilles himself week five. So really, four guys that didn't play a lot together last year trying to all come together around Tittman. He's in his second year at center out of Wisconsin. Empty again, five wide, third and 19. Four-man rush to the outside. Cutting back in to the 43-yard line goes Brees home. Peppers making the tackle there. So fourth and long, and they'll send in, in all likelihood, the punt group. So these days, who knows? You know. Analytic. Yeah, right. Never know. The 58-yard field goal is like a chip shot these days. That's true. It's crazy. But they're going to punt here. Thomas Morstead's been around 16 years, most of those in New Orleans. Marcus Jones sets up inside his 10. Put some back spin on it, and it bounces into the end zone. So Jacoby Brissett will take the reins when the Patriots take over from the 20-20 yard line. so with a play fake and look out he gets hit as he throws does Percet no gain that time pass caught there Quincy Williams made the tackle on Hunter Henry who caught 8 of the 17 completions last week in the game against Seattle Jacoby Percet is a great story through the years persevering he's been in some strange and odd places a look at his career numbers he was actually drafted by the Patriots at a North Carolina State in the third round back in 2016 behind Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo. To the right side, and only a yard gain there by Ramondre Stevenson, who's developing into one of the best running backs in the league. Yeah, a great back, and this is an offense that wants to be smart. Right now, with where they are with Brissette, and especially what's going on with the offensive line, they've got to try to stay ahead of the chains. They cannot afford to be third and nine tonight against this Jets defense in the way they can press you. They're starting a left tackle. They have two rookies starting tonight. Layden Robinson at right guard. Caden Wallace, who is a right tackle in college, making his first career start at left tackle, number 70. So Alex Van Pelt comes over from Cleveland to run the offense. Little O'Brien ran it last year. Look out. Pressure is put on, and he has to fling it away. That time it was Quincy Williams coming in. The quarterback was out of the pocket. No intentional grounding. It's funny because Mayo told us in our meeting, he said the key is going to be to take care of their front, but so far that Jets front bursting through. Yeah, no doubt about it, and they're not having a pity party for this inexperienced offensive line. Jeff Albrecht bringing everybody there on that third down. That's what I said. This offense has to be in those third and two, third and three, third and manageable, third and nine will not work tonight at all for this offense. Bryce Barringer becoming one of the best punters in the league. Third and gross average coming into the game. Gibson is back. And he makes the catch along the sideline. Picks up about three more yards, and Rodgers will take over at that spot. Just underway. 8.34 to go in the first at the middle lane. To get in the field goal range, they're probably thinking about trying to get another touchdown on the board the way they've been playing and executing. So second down and two, Rodgers. Terrific half, 13-15, 157. A lot of yards after the catch. And what's he got in mind here on the second and a deuce? 319! That hard count. 42-yard line goes three-stall, so he gets the first down. I don't know if people can tell this at home, But the ball is coming out of Aaron Rodgers' hands differently tonight than I think we've all seen in a long time. It's almost like he's a great player. We know all that. But I'm talking about the velocity, the spin. I mean, he is in a zone right now, and the ball has been right on the money every single time showing the athletic ability. Looks like the old Aaron Rodgers tonight. For sure. Under a minute. To the ground again. Good move by Hall. Takes it to the 35. So the Jets with their timeouts, they can use them when they want. They can run the clock all the way down. They can score at the end. And we'll be back in 30 seconds with the Jets on top by 11. Rough half for the Pats offense. Great half for the Jets offense. 46 seconds. It's second down and two at the 35-yard line. Kind of impatient, running the football, hitting some underneath. You just have a feeling at some point he's going to take a shot. Why not on second and short try to make that play downfield? Meanwhile, Peppers went back to the locker room. So the secondary depleted. And Rodgers taking the shot here. Too far. Garrett Wilson, another flag, is down this time at the line of scrimmage. Wilson freed down the sideline. Here's Hussey as you look at Peppers. Legal motion. Offense number five. Five-yard penalty. Second down. That's Wilson. He got a little lazy here. These are the things when we were talking with Aaron Rodgers. He said, this guy can be as good as he wants. But just a little thing like this, you do the little things right, it can really take you to another level. Here he just goes in motion, and he starts to go forward before the ball is snapped. So if he ends up hitting this for a touchdown, the play comes back. And Aaron is really challenging Garrett Wilson to learn to really take that next step as a third-year player. Yeah, he's ridiculous talent and skill set. But he's really challenged him just to do the mental aspect of the game. And I think Aaron's really going to impact his career long term. Got everybody up tight there. Backers up. Alan Flares makes the catch and right there. Good tackling. Josh Boucher making the stop there. Clock ticking down to a half a minute. It's third down, third and five. Second timeout. We'll take a timeout. This will be a 30-second timeout. So Robert Kraft is in his 30th year. He bought this team back in 1994. There he is with his son, Jonathan Kraft. Has watched his team go to ten Super Bowls and win six of them. Nine Super Bowls and six wins under Belichick. Bought the team for less than $200 million back in 1994. You know what's interesting? People forget. You know who tried to buy the team? Jeff Lurie. And Jeff Lurie couldn't buy the team. Kraft won the bid or whatever you want to call it at that particular point. And so Lurie winds up with the Philadelphia Eagles. Both struck gold. Yeah, both worked out pretty well. I was down there on the field. He comes over and starts talking. He says, can I go back upstairs with you and say hello to my guy, Al? I was like, yeah, if you want to just come up, we'll head up together. He makes the rounds. Third down and five. Pressure. Caught over the middle. Mike Williams to the 20-yard line. So on a third down and five, New York now takes a timeout. Their final. Very risky to bring this pressure here because of the opening right here, and that's exactly where Aaron Rodgers wants to go. Brees Hall does a nice job of stepping up there, and there again is Mike Williams. It's not just Garrett Wilson and Lazard. It so good to see Mike Williams back from the ACL week three last year for the 23 season Coming back they worked him back early against San Fran with the nine snaps last week A lot more with 35 And if he keeps coming along, I think that's the third option, along with the two backs in the backfield, that could make this offense dangerous to stop. One to see is Garrett Wilson against Gonzalez. He's pretty close to being in phase, but boy, Aaron Rodgers brings him back on that back shoulder. doesn't quite get that second foot down, but I love the fact that when he threw that football, he was right with him. But the ball and the location of the football brought Wilson back to give him a chance there, and it shows you the confidence that Rodgers has in the receiver, Garrett Wilson. Rodgers was 6-for-6. That's his first incompletion. Empties it again here. Hangs in the pocket. Fires caught. That's another first down. Xavier Gibson making the catch there second year man out of Stephen F. Austin and that's going to make it first down goal for the Jets it's amazing how Nathaniel Hackett all of a sudden looks like he knows how to call plays when he has number 8 back there they're just going to clear this with Conklin and then come underneath kind of that matchup zone playing a little bit of man because of that that route that the Jets ran but great separation there by Gibson quick slot receiver Ball right on the 10 for a first and goal. Short shot. Quick throw. Good move. And despite hanging on to the shirt into the end zone, goes Alan Lazard. Great move on Alex Austin that time. And the Jets fans. Something to go wild about after last season. Great looking drive. On that drive, eight plays, 73 yards, three rushes, five passes. And Lazard's experience, understanding that there's any chance at any moment, Rodgers will board a run play. That's an outside zone to the right. He comes out of it. Quick release, as always, from Aaron Rodgers. And he gives number 10 a chance after the catch to get to that corner for the touchdown. Greg Zerline for the extra point. And the New York Jets with 4.21 to go in the opening quarter. Aaron Rodgers leading a beautiful drive. Lead the Patriots 7-0. In zone, he sprinted over to his man Aaron Rodgers to get him that football. 67% of the kickoffs this far this season have gone like that for touchbacks. so now the Patriots who have run a total of three plays and the Jets have run 15 and here comes Brissette starting to talk about his journey drafted by the Patriots he was going to be the practice squad quarterback but that was the year in 2016 Brady got suspended for four games Garoppolo got hurt in the second game Brissette took over for two games then of course Tom came back before the year was done they win the Super Bowl. Unbelievable incredible experiences that he's had. That one, going to Indy and being around Andrew Luck and Phillip Rivers. A lot of people have been able to impact him. Such a cerebral quarterback, and I think it's why he continues to get these opportunities. Kind of guy you definitely root for. Pass is caught. Trying to come back to this side is Douglas, to Mario Douglas, who was frustrated this week talking about not getting targeted last week. It's targeted here, but no room to roam second and long. He brings great quickness, and obviously they need to get him to football. Just to recap, you're starting two rookies up front. It's a game where you need to be able to possess the football and keep it away from Aaron Rodgers. That's not going well, and you need to stay ahead of the chains. Second and nine. Hangs in the pocket. Caught, but only a very short game here. Jalen Pope, touchdown last week against Seattle. rookie out of Washington picked him in the second round. Good looking rookie. Really is. Strong hands. Was a leader on that Washington team last year. They ended up getting all the way to the national championship. And they played Michigan. Everybody talks about Roma Dunze, but Jalen Polk had a great year himself. And this is where they want to be. This will give them a chance with this offensive line on the road to try to be able to handle this crowd and see what gives them some options with Brissette or with the big back Stevenson. Third down and three. trips to the left side Stevenson was the man in motion Persever will fire over the middle and into traffic and it's taken in there by Hunter Henry as we said last week he caught 8 passes last week they completed a total of 17 yes and he's got 5 receivers out Henry's right here he's just going to work into the middle of this defense remember CJ Mosley is not in the middle of that defense providing that leadership and somehow their top target in these first couple weeks gets lost. Give a lot of credit to the offensive line, right? Against that Jets pass rush. Good job holding up on third down. First down here, Stevie Jets game. Prime and Ed has been here for years. Took a brief respite a few years ago after the bubble game when he said, I'm not coming back. But he did. And there he is again, leading J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets. So the Patriots won the toss They will defer The Jets to receive We're going to see Rodgers right off the bat The dynamic kickoff Resulting in still A few more touchbacks Than I think most people expected Beautiful look down at MetLife Stadium adorned in green will be here next week on Thursday night when it will be blue as the Giants take on the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night football. Joey Sly will kick off Xavier Gibson who ran a punt back against Buffalo on opening night last year to win the game. Back to Racine and Rodgers and company will take over at the 30-yard line. Had a great conversation. We did our meeting with Rodgers the other day. He is pumped up. He is ready to go. He's excited as he's ever been. And he's really, he's just savoring the moment. At 40 years old, he'll be 41 in December. But he is totally immersed in the Jets and their fortunes this year. It was interesting. We had a chance to talk to him. And it seems like we talked to him for about an hour, and he just talked about the process. It's not just a game. It's the easy part to get excited about. He loves the, in this case, Monday through Wednesday, getting ready for a game tonight. Running back is Brees Hall. The fake to him. Play action. Throws. Caught. Catch. Five-yard gain. Garrett Wilson stopped there by Christian Gonzalez. They made a big point this week about the importance of getting him involved. In fact, that's one of the things that Aaron Rodgers talked about was we got to get him the ball early. Get him on the first snap. Get him the football in his hands. And they go no huddle. Quick in the pace. Right off the bat. Aaron surveying on a second down and four. Here comes the blitz. It's picked up. Plus Aaron out of the pocket. Fakes the toss. Slides to a stop. First down. Savai coming in. But he was picked up. On the block in the backfield. Gave Rodgers room. First down. You can just feel the whole stadium on one hand excited. On the other hand, get down. Get down. Take care of yourself after what happened a year ago. From the 41-yard line. Green 19! He brought that green 19 from Green Bay with him. And that pass is on the outside. And hold in Mike Williams. The longtime charger and the off-injured Mike Williams. They're going to spot him. They spotted him last week and probably again tonight. Yeah, nine snaps in the opener against Sam Fran, all the way up to 35 last week. Look at that effort, the length that he has at 6'4". And this guy could be a secret weapon on the opposite side of Garrett Wilson. You know about Al Lazard. They'd really like to see Mike Williams coming off that ACL get healthy and be that third option for Aaron Rodgers. Good group of receivers, second down and five. Quick throw outside across the 50. Stiff arm, first down at the 43-yard line. Alan Lazard is a former Packer teammate. Marcus Jones got stiff arm, first down New York. And this is the challenge against Aaron Rodgers. It's just a pre-snap recognition. You're going to sit back and be soft and give him that quick throw. He's going to take it. Offensive line's running a play. He sees he's got Lazard with a soft corner. makes that quick throw out there. I don't know if there's another quarterback, obviously, in the league that sees coverage and has a feel pre-snap better than Aaron Rodgers. Go empty. First down. Rodgers looking left, now right. Flushed out. Downfield, going for it all in the end zone and broken up in the end zone. Jonathan Jones breaking it up. That was Mike Williams there. Could not haul it in. Second down as he goes to the bomb. Yeah, Morgan Moses, the right tackle, is going to be called for a holding call here. Offense number 78. Ten-yard penalty. First down. And when Rodgers got out of the pocket, you know, Moses starts to panic a bit and starts to lock up with the defender. You know, that was Jennings. Once he tried to get outside. Well, I'll tell you what. For a guy pressure that came in from the inside. So really good job of creating some confusion by Jeff Ulbrich, who's the defensive coordinator, and changing up some looks here. And they're going to have to make some adjustments if you're in New England here at halftime, trying to get ready for more pressure. If they launch a Hail Mary, the Jets have three defenders at the goal line. So Brissett tries to find time, launches it into the end zone, and a lot of action back there and knocked away. This is the end. Tony Adams of the second quarter. Batting it down. So the Jets 252 yards in the first half and the Patriots were held to 40. And down we go to Kaylee. Well, Robert, that last drive might not have ended the way you wanted it to, but we've seen Aaron Rodgers effective in and out of the pocket. You had eight different receivers. What's impressed you most about your offense? You know, the tempo of our offense has been really good. We've been getting in and out of the huddle. We're running the ball really well. We're converting third downs. Three out of four drives ended up in scoring opportunities at least, but we just got to keep that going. You told us you expected guys to step up, even with those key defensive injuries you were dealing with. How have they been able to keep bringing that pressure up front? Relentless. You know, our D-line is deep. We take a lot of pride. We set the standard on the defensive line, and we just got to keep going. All right, thank you. All right, thank you, Kaylee. Coming up right after the break here, it's the State Farm Halftime Show with Carissa and the game. Weeks game got away from the way Aaron Rodgers has been playing. So what you got to do is you got to get back to, like you said, you look at those numbers, you're thinking they're down by three possessions. If you can put a drive together here, put points on the board, you're right there. So it's a matter of adjusting to the pressure that the Jets have dialed up in getting that offensive line to get comfortable here in this second half. Can they? Start from the 30. Moments ago, Kaylee down on the field with Mayo. Gerard, the Jets defense has brought pressure against your makeshift O-line. What do they need to do to handle that better? It's all about fundamentals. It's all about seeing the pitcher through the same set of goggles. Those guys got to play better. That was my message just as a team. It goes back to fundamentals. It goes back to fundamentals. We've got to keep the quarterback clean and also run the ball. That was my next question. How do you get Aaron Rodgers out of his rhythm? Our defense has been out there for a long time. He's pinpoint right now. We've got to continue to spin the dial and get pressure on him. All right, so we start from the 30-yard line now. Stevenson is the back. Carried four times, 19 yards, and not a good beginning for these guys. McDonald is right there breaking through. The problem you have is when you don't have a threat downfield in this offense. The linebackers don't respect anything, so they're flying downhill. There's no fear at all right now. It's something that New England's going to eventually have to grow into. McDonald did a nice job of collapsing down from the right. Watch these linebackers. Do you think they're waiting around for the double team to climb up? No way. Quincy Williams flying downhill to get into that backfield. there's the defensive alert in the pocket he stands and the ball is caught up in the 36 yard line by Jalen Polk the rookie tackled by Sauce Gardner making third down and five gotta be really proud if you again Brissette standing behind two rookies on that offensive line a guy at left guard Michael Jordan who was on the practice squad two weeks ago, and they opened the season against Cincinnati. Caden Wallace played right tackle his entire career at Penn State, and he's starting tonight in his first career start at left tackle. And Brissette standing in there being a man, knowing there's pressure. Third down and four. Here comes the blitz. Pass is incomplete. Too much pressure. And down he goes. So you got Brissette going down. The backup would be Drake May, and that's a whole other story. He will be, in all likelihood, the quarterback of the future. Here comes the pressure. Usually he's just C4, but against this offensive line, they're dialing up because they know they can affect the timing and the rhythm of Brissette, and no separation, no timing for the receivers to get any separation on that third down play. So a real fast three and out. Barringer's punt. Fielded. Gibson. 20, 30, and stopped at the 33-yard line and slung down at that point. Crowd looking for a flag, but it will be 41 in December. Can he lead the Jets to the promised land, or at least to the wild card round? Checking out everything. second and 12 up to the 13 yard line goes Grease Hall and that's going to take us to the end of the quarter and the 1-7 to nothing the New York Jets leading the Patriots back from the Meadowlands after this Giants Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit Kaylee Hartung third down and six for New York as we start the second quarter Jets on top 7-0 9-48. 9-48. Look at the 8. Look at the 8. Rodgers. Pressured. Gets away. Throws. Caught. Another first down. Breaking away is Lazard. Destroyed the touchdown. Still going. Out to the 41-yard line. Shades of the old days with the Packers. Broke away from Jonathan Jones. But down on the ground right now for the Patriots. After a 20-yard gain is Jabril Peppers. The former New York Giants wearing that Guardian helmet and limps off. They get pressure off from the right. Watch the block by Tyron Smith. He pins that defensive end and allows Rodgers again, who's showing that athletic ability, 40 years old, moving around very well, feels the pressure, gets turned, eyes downfield, makes a great throw on that third down play, and a good job again by that offensive line taking care of him. Peppers will go into the blue tent. and the Jets have a first down to the 40-yard line. Rodgers 9 of 10 for 90 yards. Play action. Goes underneath. Ball. To the 45 on New England. Another big game here. Jones makes the stop. Picks up 14. I think anybody watching this is excited to see number 8 do his thing, but I think if you're being honest, it's not just him. and his wisdom and his experience. It's his accuracy. And then the yards after the catch. Lazard on the touchdown and some other catches that he's had. Now it's Brees Hall. So his teammates really helping him out here after the catch, making some big plays. Nothing like Yak. Yards after the catch for a quarterback. And a big hole here. And another first down as Allen picks up 12. three plays, three big gains they're already down to the Patriot 35 yard line right guard, watch the right guard here Vera Tucker, nice kick out block the center and the left guard they kind of work that double team on the back side opens it up very very nicely and when you get Braylon Allen running downhill following Jeremy Ruckert he is a handful to bring down for those safeties Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar. Let's go. P-19. Another big hole. Another eight-yard gain. And that time they brought Bates. You saw him move into the backfield. Said him providing the leverage. Called a gain of seven. Second and three. I mean, I'm so fascinated with the improvement of this offensive line. You and I had them twice last year, and they were trying to get 13 different offensive line combinations, most of anybody in the NFL. They were doing anything they could to put five guys out there healthy. They made that a priority in the offseason. They brought in three new faces. They're starting to really come together, and they're getting a hat on a hat tonight and opening up some great running lanes. We had them twice. They were a reasonable facsimile of what they could have been. And bursting through, they needed a play like that did the Patriots after this drive. That's Tavai making the play for a loss of a couple, setting up a third down and five, three minutes into the second quarter. Daniel Hackett is fired up to be able to work with his group, criticized two years ago as the head coach in Denver, comes over to New York, things don't go very well last year, the whole Aaron Rodgers injury, Zach Wilson, the injuries up front, he, of course, is a scapegoat, and now I think showing what he can do with Aaron Rodgers and a full compliment around him. Two and a half years in Green Bay. Rodgers fires, and that's caught. Garrett Wilson makes the catch at the 20-yard line. Yeah, Rodgers loves hacking. He told us the other day, if we execute, he's a great coach. If we don't, he takes a lot of crap, and that's too bad. I love his schemes, his philosophy. I want to play really well so he gets the credit he deserves. I thought that was very telling, and I think it's true for any, by the way, any offensive coordinator out there, when you execute, the plays look great. And I think one of the things Aaron Rodgers loves is taking a play sheet and bringing it alive the day of the game. And a lot of times... Reese Hall is the back from the 34-yard line. 319! Give it to him. You know, down on the field before the game, Kirk, I'm watching, you know, from behind Aaron, it's just so easy. I mean, it's like he just flicks the wrist. Yeah. And he throws in the hip and trendy vernacular of the day, dimes, right? Yeah, he does. And I was able to actually talk to him a little bit about his technique, and I said it's so strange. You know, your lead foot, the heel of your foot, never touches the ground. And he talked about how he really naturally kind of has this ability to brace himself because his whole goal is to keep his body weight back. So he says he does that. It's almost like a kickstart where he puts that left foot down, but the heel doesn't. And then it's like a pop, and it creates that hip drive, and that's the velocity on the football. Allen and Hall were both in the backfield. Look out from behind. Avoids the sack. Going to take off. Going to seek the sideline and find it. And gets tackled as he crosses the boundary by Keon White. He's fine. He shakes his head. He says, okay, man. Well, whatever. Yeah, he's done. It's football, right? I mean, I loved what he said about, you know, being 40 and getting hit like this. I mean, there's some of us, we play in the backyard with our kids at 40, and you go down like this, and your lower back hurts. He said, you know, I mean, he said Tom used to talk about this, and it's not a late hit. He said, you know, I'm 40 years old, but I got a chef, and I take care of myself year-round. And he said, I feel better at 40 than maybe I did at 25 when I didn't take care of myself. Yeah, much like Brady. maybe drinks an AR8 to the TB 12 through the middle to the 50 yard line goes Brees Hall he is he has looked great tonight just you'd expect him to be in command he's completing passes he's looking off defenders has had help the receivers are running good routes the guys are making plays after the catch but this is just him using his eyes That's what you've seen him do throughout his career. Good to see the tight end Conklin getting involved. Here's a great job. He knows he's coming back to the right the whole time, but moves the safeties right where he wants to create that space on that seam route to give Conklin a chance to go up and catch the ball and get down to protect himself. Go ahead. No, no, 48. 48, 48. Loop 58. Loop 58. Second down. Hand off. Braylon Allen. comes up a little bit shy of the first by inches. Third down coming up. He was excited to be back home to be able to use that hard count. You know, a lot of times he uses it on third down. He's been on the road at San Francisco last week down in Nashville. Gets the Titans. Two physical fronts, by the way, and now back home. He tried it a couple times earlier on that hard count, and Morgan Moses jumped to see if he tries it here on third and one. That's three tight ends in the game right now. Allen's the running back. 319! Off the play fake on third and short to the outside. And that's going to be hauled in. Inbounds by Rucker. Got the first down. I mean, I just love the ball. I think we just, I don't even want to talk. I just want to just watch this. This is why the Jets fans were devastated when he went down in the fourth play last year. It's one thing to make plays in the pocket, but when he starts making them off-platform like this and throws an absolute rope on the outside shoulder to Rucker, and he's creating like that and feeling good, it's just beautiful. Going out again, both in the backfield. and the play is blown dead. Prior to the delay game, first charge timeout, New York Jets. This will be a 30-second timeout. So for the Jets, look, their fans know the history. You don't have to repeat it. It's like hitting them over the head with a sledgehammer. No playoffs, 13 years. Denver will be next in eight years, eight straight losing seasons. The number one game in the history of the Jets after the 1968 season, Super Bowl III, one of the seminal games in the history of the National Football League, a long time ago. Yeah, and it's week three. We're not going to get crazy here, but you watch a lot of football. It's a year where offenses are struggling. We're not seeing the numbers that we normally see. improvising and making adjustments at the line of scrimmage and on the sideline like he did last week in Tennessee. Toss. Look out. And again, bursting through this time is Anthony Jennings. Unimpeded into that backfield. Loss of seven on the plate, second and 17. Mike Williams tries to make this block, but he cannot handle the size and quickness of Jennings, who gets inside of both he and Ruckert and gets into that backfield. You know, Jennings was just a guy who was waiting for an opportunity last year. Judon went down with that injury. Matthew Judon goes down. He kind of goes from being a role player to an opportunity, takes advantage of it, and now is a guy they're really counting on on this defense. Second and 17. Fired, caught on the move. And it's a first and goal. Tyler Conklin to the five-yard line. And Rodgers with that flick of the wrist makes it look so simple. He's in total control. Watch his head look to the right to try to move this linebacker, Raekwon McMillan, initially. Move him. Knows exactly where he wants to go, but he needs that middle to open up. So he moves Raekwon McMillan, comes back to Conklin. Jets fans have been asking, where is the tight end? We're hoping to get the tight end more and more involved. That quick release, perfect accuracy, and more yards after the catch. 12-13, 135 for Rodgers. First down, goal. On the ground. To the outside, then back through the middle. Got to about the one. Brees home is stopped there. Second down and goal. Take a Braylon Allen. Braylon Allen is at physical back at 235. Again, we talked about Brees Hall, a little jump cut, patience, lower the shoulder, runs right through the safety there, Kyle Duggar. Good job there. Actually, it's 21 Hawkins who's in there. Solomon Thomas now comes in, the lineman to line up in the backfield. There he is as the fullback in front of the hole. Put the big X-49ers in there, have a little bit of motion here. Fake it to him. And then it's into the end zone and incomplete. Tried a little play action. Pass a little low. Conklin covered on the play. Sets up third down and goal. Actually really good discipline from Kyle Duggar to be in position, not be fooled. They just ran the football downhill. Almost got it in with Brees Hall. Go to that jumbo formation with three tight ends. You're thinking run again, but it's a play action. He's got time. But it's just great coverage by Duggar. third down and goal record is the fullback on the ground can he get in he rolls and they're going to say he's short they're ready to turn the lights off and on Jennings is there line just comes right in take another peek here Jennings makes a heck of an effort That knee is up. I think that's a touchdown. I think he broke the plane. I think that's six. Crowd, of course, is seeing what you are seeing right now. Terry McCauley, what do you see? Just exactly the way you see it. He's up. That knee is not down when the ball breaks the plane. This is a review of a play, obviously. Coach's challenge. We'll see if they replay assistant. Sometimes the replay assistant sees it, and he'll say, hey, listen, here's the call before we even look at it. Fourth down and goal. Salah with a wry sort of smile indicating he's in. They're challenging the ruling on the field that the runner was short of the goal line. Timeout. So they will take a look at video and back after this. Challenge upheld Another great drive The Jets have scored on back drives 13 plays 91 yards all of last season Twice they scored on back drives touchdowns This year they've already done it twice. They did it in Tennessee, and now tonight. This first half is exactly what this Jets team wanted to see. The eight first downs in the first quarter alone. That's the most they've had since going back to 2021. Aaron Rodgers in complete command. You're just going to knock on wood and hope that Aaron Rodgers is able to stay healthy. You start to see the pieces around him. You see this offensive line. It's only going to get better with three new pieces. Wilson on the outside. Lazard. Mike Williams getting healthy. Brees Hall. Braylon Allen. Conklin making plays. It's a lot to this offense. And here is the rookie, Allen, to the 38-yard line. The last time the Jets got into the playoffs, they actually got to the AFC Championship game two years in a row with Mark Sanchez quarterbacking and Buddy Ryan as the Rex Ryan. Yeah. Buddy's pop. Yeah. And that's the last time they got to the playoffs. It's been a minute. Look, by the way, we're seeing a lot of Braylon Allen. We saw him last week with some plays and a couple touchdowns. Seeing him more and more tonight. Loved what Aaron Rodgers said about him. We'll talk about that after this play. Second and seven. Good fake. Pressure's on. Throws underneath. Checks it down to Allen for a short game. The third down and three. You know, you've got the oldest player in the league and the youngest player in the league. And he just, when we were talking to him yesterday, he just started the day before, he just kind of went on and on and on about brilliant. And he said, you know, I knew about him when he was a freshman at University of Wisconsin. I was a big fan watching him. And now we end up drafting him. And he said, what I really love about him is he sits right in front of me in the meetings. He's got his pen out. He's taking notes. He's very, very mature for a guy as young as he is at 20 years old. He's just been blown away by the want inside of him. and he's not surprised he's playing well. Allen grew up watching him. Rodgers flushed out, keeps his eyes downfield, fires, finds the man. This time it's the tight end, Conklin. Extends the play on the move, throwing on the money. How many plays has he made tonight on the run? Watch the right tackle help him here, Morgan Moses. He actually does a nice job. Aaron Rodgers steps up, and then Moses pins that pressure, And now he's got outside, breaks outside contained. And the ability to kind of wait and find that open receiver. And he is as dangerous as anybody out there because of how quick that ball gets out and how accurate he throws on the run. And he looks good tonight. As good as ever. Remember, his last year in Green Bay wasn't that good. Been gone all of last year except for four plays. And tonight, back to the future. Second charge timeout New York Jets Again, New York had to take a timeout Their second of the half Play of game Could be significant down the stretch If this game gets close Or closer 16-yard line, first down Halfway through the third quarter Rogers to the outside Caught, home And Brees Hall gets tackled at the 10-yard line Last week they go to that same formation that empty set, put Brees Hall out there. Linebacker walked out on him. He went down the field, made a play, this time with soft coverage from another linebacker. Raekwon McMillan walks out there, knows it's man coverage, just says, hey, instead of running the football to get six, let's just throw it out there quickly to Brees Hall and get some positive yards. That package will be something teams are going to have to defend every single week with Rodgers' ability to find a matchup. Second and four to the outside. Good move. Tackled with the two. Garrett Wilson taken down there by Jones to save the touchdown. First and goal. You know, you think about him with his body control downfield making plays. But with the soft coverage like that, get it to him in a hurry. He's just as dangerous after the catch. We've seen that theme kind of repeating itself tonight. These New York Jets receivers making plays with accurate throws from Aaron Rodgers. Boy, he's got live legs. Five almost takes that to the corner for a touchdown. Broke away from Christian Gonzalez. First and goal. Rodgers defeat. The throw. Caught. Staying inbounds. Yes. Touchdown. Garrett Wilson. There's Garrett Wilson's first touchdown from Aaron Rodgers. We're going to be seeing a lot of that. Eight to five. How about this throw? Gonzalez rolls the dice. He's thinking about trying to get his team back in his game. Jumps it. And if he does get there, he maybe has a chance. But that ball is, again, not to be a broken record, perfectly thrown to the outside, away from the defender. And there's that body control. Looking for room a little bit. Not much. taken down just shy of midfield by Quincy Williams with two and a half to go in the quarter. He has been a workhorse in these first couple weeks. Stevenson, he carried it 23 times on an average. You go back to the Cincinnati game, he had a lot to do with him closing out that win on the road. 25 carries on the game, 21 again last week against Seattle. Physical back, but really elusive. As good as there is at making defenders miss in the NFL. Early in the game, they bring in a sixth lineman, Zach Thomas. Getting a little beef up front here. Maybe help out the other guys. Second down and seven. Off the play fake. Protection is good, and the pass is no good. That's how I'm intended for Austin Hooper, the number two tight end, to make a third down and seven. They continue to try to mix in that jumbo look with the six offensive linemen, trying to give that indicator to the Jets that they're going to run the football, but they try to break a trend there with Alex Van Pelt. The only negative side when you take that shot is now you got third down. Now the last time we were in third down, they were able to protect and give him enough time. Remember, the Jets don't blitz a lot. They rely on their front four to be able to get home and play a lot of zone. Let's see if they dial it up here a little bit more. They're showing it. Will they come? Went to stunt up front and get to him. Sacked back at the 40-yard line. Protection breaks down. You got McDonald was there. Kinlaw as well. McDonald had three sacks last week. Flag is thrown on the play. Offense number 70. That penalty is declined. Fourth down. So that's a penalty on illegal formation on Wallace, the rookie left tackle. Yeah, remember the big emphasis this year with the league, with those left tackles getting into the backfield, and you can see he gets pressure from the left, but the entire pocket against that inexperienced offensive line, just on that third down, just collapses on Brissette. Never had a shot. So Barringer with his second punt. Xavier Gibson sets up at his own 10-yard line almost blocked fair catch called for and made at the 10-yard line 1-19 to play in the quarter Rodgers and company back with a 7-0 lead back that last sack for the Jets a half a sack each for McDonald giving him three and a half now between last Sunday and tonight, and Michael Clemens. All right, Rodgers, after that great drive, only one incomplete pass thus far. He's already at six different receivers less than 14 minutes into the game. Start on the ground. About four for Brees Hall, second down. I think early in the year, a lot of Jets fans were concerned about, besides Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall, who are going to be the other options. Lazard we know about, Gibson maybe. And tonight we've seen, again, Mike Williams getting involved. He's spreading around. You've got Braylon Allen as a potential target. But I think there's a lot of excitement. You can feel it in the stadium tonight. Think about this offense over the last five years. Go back to 2019, 31st, 32nd, 29th, 29th, 29th. And with number eight back there, there's hope that this offense can be productive and give them a chance to be a very competitive team. To the outside, dangerous throw, and Holden one-handed by Hull. To make it third down, and with a half a minute to go on a flag down. John Hussey to make the call. Holding. Offense number 83. Half the distance to the goal. Second down. That's Tyler Conklin. Tight end. And that's going to make it second down and 12 half the distance back to the seven yard line. And ball gets thrown right there in front of him. And I think that left hand on the shoulder pad could be the only thing that you see. Rodgers, he always looks omniscient back there. Those eyes. Talked about with Garrett Wilson. Zerline, the point after is good. So after the Pats go 3-and-a-half, the Jets go down the field. 11 plays, 66 yards, and lead by 18. Passing TDs, run for 16 yards. Garrett Wilson just made that tucks down grab. 25 yards on four catches and nothing doing for that catch offense. Three points, 46 total yards. So the Jets have gained 318 yards to 46 for New England. 21-3 is the score. And Zerline to kick off. So for the Patriots, they're down in the end zone here. Of course, you know, they needed to get a quarterback of the future out of college. But you've seen him a lot. Your take on May. Oh, he's outstanding. I mean, he's got a bright future. And I really love the fact that so far he's having a chance to sit and learn. First getting thrown into the fire. We've seen a lot of young quarterbacks last couple years, including this year. Brissette meanwhile throws and getting open that time is Douglas Demario Douglas pressure put on by Jalen Holmes who took Brissette down at the end of the play hung in there and a good job here again by the rookie left tackle he holds on just long enough Brissette just gets that ball off and there's the separation because they're able to give him enough time and it's good to see Pop Douglas get a chance to get his hands on the football one of the more electrifying threats that they have out on the perimeter. Play action again. Pressure again. Sets up the screen. Caught. Hooper. The tight end rumbles all the way inside the 30 to the 29 yard line. It's good to see the nice screen there. It's a great answer to pressure. One last thing on Drake May. I mean, I think anybody who watched him play, He kind of has that it factor. Athletic family. Dad played football in college. Brother won a national championship at North Carolina. Just a great teammate and a guy that I think is eager to learn and understands his role right now. And I think you look at some of the quarterbacks that had to sit back and wait. Aaron Rodgers, Jordan Love, there's been a lot of them. And Rodgers knows that all to well three years with Favre there. Meanwhile, that ball is caught at the 25. Douglas tackled at the 23. Candie, what you got? Well, guys, whether Drake May is taking a snap with the first team in practice, running the scout team, or studying in the meeting room, David Andrews told me that he's seen the rookie embracing his role and asking all the right questions. Andrews, with his 10 years of experience, appreciates the effort May has put in with him, specifically wanting to learn how the center communicates on the field. All right, here's Brissette back to pass, and that is incomplete. A couple of coverage right there, intended that time for Thornton. So the interesting thing is in most quarterbacks, the number one guy will get 90%, 95% of the snaps. The other guy, 5% to 10%. But they go 70%, 30%. Brissett's been getting 70%. But Macy and a lot of first-team snaps, 30%. And that's their way that they feel that they're going to allow him to develop. And also, he's getting those live reps against the first-team defense, you know, on the show team. So that also helps him. It's a big third down here for this offensive line in Brissett against his pressure. and a good start to the drive. Can they keep it rolling? It's a high snap. He pulls it down, dancing, firing, and that's incomplete. And he had a flag down here as Demario Douglas was the intended receiver. There's also a flag in the offensive backfield. So you have one in the secondary and one in the offensive backfield. There are two fouls on the play, one by each team. Holding, offense number 60. Pass interference, defense number 30. Those fouls will offset. Replay, third down. Andrews on one side, Carter on the other. Back once we started. Third down. Yeah, Quentin Williams comes right over the middle of this offense. It's a good matchup. It's a tough ask for Andrews. He's a great player, been around a long time. But that time, a holding call is he just gives in to the power. And then, wow, that was, I didn't see any. Card line is Gibson to set up what will be about a 43-yard field goal attempt. And there is the injured C.J. Mosley. The good news is he was thought to be maybe even a game-time decision tonight. They're going to rest him 10 days before the next game. Yeah, just the leader of the alpha of this defense. That's why you're seeing Sherwood 44 out there playing a lot more and playing pretty well. Joey Sly, 44-yard attempt. Joe Cardona, the longtime snapper. And the operation is very clean. And they get through. Next Thursday night, we're right back here at the Meadowlands. It's the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants. The Cowboys 1-1. With Baltimore in a big one. Giants start 0-2. They're in Cleveland. Kickoff 8-15 at Eastern. We might as well just pitch a tent in the parking lot. You going to pull a hardball and just stay here? Or are you going to go all the way back the other direction? To be determined. But it's already been determined. Anyway, big night for the Jets fans here. See about the Giants next week. with 3.56 to go in the first half. And they're going to run this baby back. This is Isaiah Davis coming back to the 25-yard line. Have a peek at this. Look at this thing, Kirk. Pretty amazing. Look what they've done tonight. Compare that to last year. six first downs on each of the last two drives. You go back to last year, six plus first downs on two of 208 drives. Amazing. What a difference a good Achilles operation by Dr. Neal Elitrosh can make, right? No doubt. Wow. And the speed bridge. I mentioned before he had a chance, chance, to come back at the end of last season, but they were at a playoff contention to shut him down. Peppers is back in the game. That's good news for the Patriots from the 24-yard line. Look out, but breaking the tackle is Allen. So he turns a loss into no gain, and Shea had him, couldn't secure him. That's about the third time we've seen it. The offensive line's done a great job. Here he gets underneath Jeremy Rucker. The offensive line's done a very nice job, but here he's just able to use his quickness, get inside of him. Looks like he's about to make a tackle, but there is the physicality of Braylon Allen using those strong legs So instead of a minus three, it puts him at second nine. Powerful. And now you've got Hall and Allen both in the backfield. Flanking number eight. Hall goes in motion. Allen takes the handoff on the inside. Brings it out to the 30-yard line, third down and four. This is a big three minutes left in this first half. Remember, New England deferred, and they get the ball to start the second half. Aaron Rodgers is thinking about points right now and DeMarcus Covington the defense coordinator and drop may were thinking Hey guys, we get a chance to get a stop here get the ball back Maybe get points and then get the ball to start the second half. So this is big sequence here coming up the old two for one big third down here This is where he's so dangerous looking for that matchup Usually he gets those free plays. This time the right tackle. Moses jumps. Offense number 78. Five-yard penalty. Third down. So the Jets have gained 199 yards. Patriots 88 at this point. And the Jets are about ready to run their 31st play of the half. Seems like penalty is the only thing slowing the Jets down. Right. correction 28 yards for the Patriots you got two guys who look like they may come on the alerts neither comes this time and Rogers goes deep and finds the open man of the 47 yard line Tyler Conklin needed nine got 22 how about the eyes knows exactly again that he wants to Come back to the middle. He looks to the left to move to safety after the snap. Look left. Look left. Come back to the right. Open up the middle. Throw. Okay, after the review, it requires a 10-second runoff. Unless the team wants to call a timeout. New England says we'll take the 10 seconds off the clock. So the clock is now at 144. Yeah, and remember, you see the Jets and Aaron Rodgers, who've been in command here in this first half. Still the three timeouts. there at the 45-yard line. Obviously a shot. Rolling against the grain. He's going to run. He's going to get the first down with 53 seconds remaining in regulation. So the Jets with a mini-bye. That's the one good thing about the guys playing on Thursday night is they get the three extra days off. Rogers can look ahead to game number four. You're right. How good does he have to feel tonight? Coming home. Home game after last year. Coming back after that game at Tennessee last week where he led that drive at the end. Turned out to be the game-winning drive. Opening night, lose in San Francisco. But all of a sudden, they've got things rolling right now, at least against the Patriots tonight. You're in that rehab center, right? You know, you probably saw him working and grinding. J.K. Dobbins and others. By the way, he's doing really well with the Chargers. Extremely. Yeah, so talk to me a little bit about what you saw when you would see him, you know, in the midst of trying to train to get his body back. Well, Elite Ortho in Los Angeles is half of the NFL injured reserve list is in there at any given point. So the guys got to know each other. Rodgers and Dobbins and Tim Patrick was in there for a long time. And Tredavious White, just about everybody. He's back there. I think that's cool, though, that they have each other to lean on. Those are some dark days. No question. Baseball players as well. Neil Eletros sends all of his people there. And, of course, the camaraderie that exists, and, you know, they can talk to each other. Dobbins, in particular, after a couple of years, right, of injuries, finds a home with the Chargers, off to a tremendous start. But he was working like crazy in there when he was in there. I'm sure. I mean, he was pressuring people to say, can I come back? I can come back before the year is done. And he might have, as I said, if they had been in playoff contention, which they weren't at the end. Well, the end result, now that we moved into 24th season, just to see him moving around. You know, the first few weeks we saw it a little bit. But, boy, tonight it's just been a completely different feed. You know, you're on the road at Tennessee. You're on the road at San Fran. Those were tough games. But back home, in control of this game from where it go. and just doing really every aspect of what you'd hope to see from him playing that quarterback position. And that's caught at the 10-yard line. And setting up a first and goal will be Demario Douglas with a half minute to go. It gives you a little bit of a feel. Drake May was actually looking off to his left when that ball was snapped. The athletic ability to just bring that snap in and then get his vision downfield. He had to step up away from pressure and then threw a dime. May under pressure and gets sacked at the 12-yard line. Who's in there at the end? Tack McKinley. Second and goal clock ticking all the way down. So the Jets, who have melted under the lights, coming in, they've lost 13 or 14 primetime games. 2-15 in the last 17 games at home in primetime. ready for prime time tonight. Different animal with number eight under center. Major. Jets 2-1. Patriots now 1-2. Jets dominate. Win it by a score of 24-3. off to week four for these guys. Robert Sala. Loving just about every bit of this. Defense great. Eight was great. Effort there to try to keep him short of the first down marker. Two and a half left in the third. Jets trying to go to two and one. Pats came in after an upset win at Cincinnati. And an overtime loss at home to Seattle. Rodgers on third and two. Looking downfield. Byers caught. Open 41-yard line. Tackled there. Tyler Conklin. I think they're going to get a roughing call after the play. Yeah, you've got two flags. One right at the line of scrimmage. The other all the way back. The flag is down to the nine-yard line. Something in the backfield. So you might have two separate calls here. Well, there's your, ooh, your roughing. That's O'Shea. And then a penalty at the line of scrimmage. Simpson maybe downfield, the left guard. There is no foul for a member of the offense downfield illegally. There is a foul, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, defense. That 50-yard penalty will be added to the end of the run. Automatic first down. You know who's really putting together a night is Conklin. Yeah. When he scrambles, there's the big hit. That's an obvious call. Fishel right there makes the call. But what makes it tough when he gets out is he throws lasers. He doesn't ease the ball in. He makes up his mind, and you just don't have a chance to react as a defense when he gets outside of the pocket. And once he makes up his mind to find that open receiver, these guys are doing a good job of adjusting to him scrambling. That time Conklin again does a good job. That's his fourth reception, 84 yards on the night. as the New York crowds are prone to do in every sport. Chanting his name, Aaron Rodgers. A couple of pretty good Aarons playing right now in New York. That's caught. And you've got a talking catch again. He's been their leading receiver tonight. Targeted six times, caught five for 94 yards. That time the defense just sank back in coverage, trying to take away the shots downfield. Aaron was looking downfield to the potential of getting it to Mike Williams or the crosser to Garrett Wilson. Everything's taken away, so he just routinely checks it down, makes a good decision. Conklin caught six passes all of last season. To the 30-yard line. I'm sorry. He caught 61. He did not score a touchdown. Only short shrifted him by 55. It felt like that just because that's the one position that I think people are excited to see the potential of the growth with Aaron Rodgers back there. I mean, again, you know about some of the other weapons. But, boy, if you can get Conklin going and Jeremy Rucker. And the two backs. The two backs. You've got Mike Williams and Lazard and Garrett Wilson. Those two backs are in there right now. Hall and Allen. Fires behind the intended target. Garrett Wilson. And one more piece of laundry. They get a shot there by Simpson. Trying to be aggressive. may have got him with maybe an illegal hit. After the play was over, unnecessary roughness. Offense, number 76. That 15-yard penalty will be enforced in the previous spot. First down. He caught it. Yeah, the ball is away. The pressure up to the top on Tyron Smith. He's doing his job working there. Right after the play, you see Simpson. Then he goes on top of him. And once he jumped on top of him is where the penalty came in. I'll tell you, he's aggressive. I mean, that's not great that he's doing this. But I don't mind the energy overall from the offensive line tonight. The whole offensive line doing the job. Of course, their number one chore. Protect number eight at all costs. Second and 25. Look out. They didn't protect him that time. down he goes at the 45 yards. And a good play earlier tonight on a sack and now heads up play here. Still playing aggressive, typical Jets defense football here late. They've been around for eight years. Picked him up from Baltimore Through the middle on first down goes Isaiah Davis So he their number three back He is a rookie picked in the fifth round out of South Dakota State One of the few guys in college football I don't think you covered last year, right? No, college game day went there one year. The Jackrabbits, if I'm not mistaken. How about that? Unbelievable. You are Johnny Cash, man. You've been everywhere. They love football up there. Second and six. Tripped up. Davis again. That time Jennings makes the tackle. Hopefully he's going to be okay. He put that right arm there to bring the ball carrier down. And then right away you could see that he was kind of feeling that. He's going to come off the field here. He has, again, been a great story. Early in his career, just trying to find his way. And last year taking advantage of that opportunity. Maybe it was when he came down on that shoulder. But he's checked out. Play for Nick Chauvin. Chastelusa. Fifth year in the league. 37. Rodgers flicks it Adjusting, making the grab Mike Williams Turned around, got position, hauls it in Beat Jonathan Jones On the play first down First off, Aaron Rodgers brings Brees Hall up To help with protection And this is why they brought Mike Williams over to New York For these opportunities Again, coming off that ACL Wondered how much he'd be able to help Back shoulder fade But really, there's Brees Hall in the protection Mike Williams makes that play. He's got to come back to the football over the defender with those long arms and make that catch. 18-yard gain. Rodgers is now thrown for 273. Moving. Looking. Running. Slides to a stop at the 11-yard line. I think I've gotten over every time he runs, I hold my breath. You know, he's a fan of the game and a fan of his. And he's done it so much tonight that you're starting to get comfortable seeing him roll and make plays. He's 5 of 5 tonight on the move. Nathaniel Hackett and Aaron Rodgers so familiar with each other. But, man, he gets out there and he's not just – I think he looks better this year than he did his last year in Green Bay as far as movement and making plays. Yeah, you may be getting comfortable, but I don't think all of the 75,000 are. Second down at eight. Allen. Backs his way to the nine-yard line. Third and short, Kaylee. Guys, the Jets' right tackle, Morgan Moses, has now been confirmed to be a left knee injury. They have taken him into the X room. But think about how you saw him walk off on his own power from the field. He went into the blue medical tent for a few minutes and then walked off this field with athletic trainers at either side until he got into the tunnel. Then he was taken by a golf cart. There is White. And he is down. No, that's great. And also they've got the extra few days now because you play Thursday night. So you've got the extra three days. So Moses will have ten days to get ready for San Francisco, which is their next stop. Yeah, I can't help but think tonight. I know you and I talked about this this week. Nathaniel Hackett under fire here in New York. It's part of the gig. You know when things aren't great, somebody's got to be the fall guy. Last year he was that guy. But I'd really like to watch three weeks in, especially tonight, starting to see this plan and the versatility of how they're attacking. I hope fans understand. Aaron Rodgers had a special night. This is not just Aaron Rodgers. This is an offensive line that I think is really showing something. receivers besides Garrett Wilson the tight end, two backs it's been a great group effort including Nathaniel Hackett putting that plan together. They have Denver next meanwhile the Patriots have to go to San Francisco. Rodgers to the end zone adjusting. No can't hold it in. Mike Williams has made so many of those catches in his career with the Chargers. Not this time though. Fourth and three. Just not quite he may mistime that one You know, he's so good at going up into the air and high-pointing the ball in these contested catches. He was actually starting to come down in a heck of an effort, by the way, with Jonathan Jones not giving up on it, getting his hands in there and ripping it away from Mike Williams on that fade. Yeah, Jones giving away six inches. 6'4", to 5'10". Fourth down. Zerline, chip shot here. 28-yard field goal attempt to try to make it 24-3, which he does with ease. He was an assistant in New England. That's when Bob Kraft got to know him under Parcells. Came with Parcells here to New York and then, of course, got the job in New England. Mayo at 38 in his first year. And how about, you know, Belichick. If you look at Bill Belichick now, of all things, TV. He's everywhere. He has rested the throne of king of all media from Howard Stern. And he's killing it. You can't miss it. He is. He's doing a great job. He and Nick Saban both doing a great job going into that world. We wouldn't expect either one of them to do that. Both seem to be enjoying it. And Mayo, he was designated early on by Bob Kraft. as the likely successor. And it goes all the way back to like 2015 or 16 when Mayo was part of a trip to Israel. His craft likes to take a lot of his current players, former players, to Israel as the catch is made here in a nine-yard game for Douglas. And he watched him in the lounge one time. He had a delayed flight at Ben Gurion Airport. And he watched the way Mayo was responding to the older guys and how he, just his presence and manner. And Kraft thought, hey, when time comes, he's going to be the guy. And he was. There's a great message there. You think Drod Mayo had any idea that Robert Kraft was sitting there watching him and making a decision that would years later impact his life? Think about that. You just never know, right? Doing the right thing and showing what you're about. Exactly. Meanwhile, swinging to the outside and taking down there is Gibson. Quincy Williams making the tackle second down. And the reason Gerard Mayo in these first couple games has been able to be competitive. I went to the game in Cincinnati. It was a game that they controlled. Did a good job of winning the time of possession. They were in the game. They had the lead. They were able to work the clock. Got out of there with a win. Last week, same thing against Seattle. Same kind of game for them. Where they were able to control things. They didn't win it, but, you know, they battled. And tonight, right away, the game gets away from Aaron Rodgers having a night. And anybody that knew anything about this matchup knew that Gerard Mayo's team needed to be able to squeeze the clock, keep Aaron Rodgers on the sideline. And once that didn't happen with this offensive line and with where they are at this stage of the game offensively, it's very, very challenging for them to get into predictable play calling. Just not their game. And it'll be that way this year. And that's why they're going to have to continue to try to grow on that side of the football. Yeah, I think they're going to have to find a top guy as a wide receiver. Meanwhile, that line breaking down again. And here come the gangrene guys. Javon Kinlaw came over from San Francisco. Gets the sack. Quincy Wilson, Quincy Williams rather, bringing pressure. And even though he doesn't get there, he occupies the back, frees up others to be able to get there. Again, we're not used to seeing Jeff Albrecht dial it up, but he's very, very wise in changing things up against this inexperienced offensive line, and it's been effective. Fifth putt for Barringer. Fielded at the 10, taken down right away is Gibson. How good is he? Yeah, he did. Beringer gets the game ball from New England. He does. Meanwhile, the tackle is made there by Schooler, who they think will take the place eventually of what Matthew Slater did in New England for all those years. Coats from around the league. You know, when it comes to field goals, it's crazy. 35 of 39 from 50-plus. In 18. And Rodgers is going to throw to the outside. Caught here. And getting spun down is Garrett Wilson. I have an idea, though. I mean, it's crazy now because it's like too much. 35 and 39 and 50 plus. You know what I want to do? What do you want to do? I want to deflate the cable. Oh, I heard you say that earlier today. What about narrowing the uprights? Could do that. It's never at all. Back to a third and four. Pissette rolling. Five's time. Here goes another flag. You know what that normally means? As the catch is made and inside the five, that's Hooper. You see that kind of a flag? And so it's always offensive holding. Yeah, left tackle here. Holding. Offense number 70. Then there a penalty. Third down. Baptism by fire for this guy tonight. Yeah, again, for people just tuning in, he's making his first career start against this defense. And been doing okay that time on a big third down. He ends up getting beat to the inside. Felt him losing that leverage and used the right hand to throw the defender down. Again, just to remind people, this guy had 40 career starts in college at Penn State. Big time program, great player. Never played left tackle. And here he is making his start tonight in the NFL. first career start on the left side. Exclusively the right side in State College. Four-man rush here. He's hit flush out again. Down he goes. Got Rinder at the end. Flag goes down. Quinton Williams got to him. He said Sloane needs some assistance in getting up. And a penalty to Booth. Holding. Offense number 70. That penalty is declined. Result of a play. Fourth down. The daily double. Well, they don't necessarily have to bring the blitz, but they do a nice stunt here with a big man bringing him around. Trying to confuse that offensive line. Nobody picks him up. Wallace is locked up. The quarterback is down by contact. He will put the ball down at the front line. So Williams will get a sack. They're going to call Jacoby Brissett down. Down by contact, which makes it fourth down in a million. And instead of getting into potential field goal range, nothing doing on that count right now. Barringer has to come back in. Barringer with his fourth punt of the night. on fourth and 26. They got three plus sacks now in each of their first three games. That's the first time since 1985, the New York sack exchange era. Gaston and company. Fair catch, not called for, taken at the nine by Gibson. back to the 12 he comes with 343 to go it's getting stats powered by aws with aaron rogers we've talked about him sitting in the pocket manipulating coverage with his eyes but how about on the move i mean it has been so great to see him back on this field tonight moving around throwing off schedule finding these receivers five of five just on fire and feeling good in this offense that Nathaniel Hackett has put together. And I think we've started to see more weapons start to come up tonight in what this offense is capable of doing. Aaron Rodgers, four times the most valuable player, most recently in 2021. Starting from the 12-yard line. Allen bunched up at the line of scrimmage. How great is that? Here we are in the third quarter, his first home game back. They're up 21-3 in the Aaron Rodgers chance began here at MetLife. Pretty cool. After how hard he worked to get back and put himself in a position to come back and play for the Jets this year at 40 years old. They've done a lot of games with the Jets here, and that was the loudest crowd I've ever heard at the beginning of the game tonight. They were amped up as they were last year on opening night, and that lasted about four minutes. second and nine flicks it, caught Allen breaks a tackle and the rookie takes it out to the 20 yard line setting up a third down and two you better come in and get low when you come up in support with Braylon Allen again 235 pounds saw him do this a lot in college this time it lowers that shoulder pretty good at that interception so Brissette done for the night under a lot of pressure 12 of 18 for 98 yards now on the ground it's Antonio Gibson as the clock ticks down to about 4 minutes to play in the 4th Third and three. Pressure. He's going to take off and knock Goldberry for him. And he's tackled there by Sherwood at the 50-yard line. May is an athletic guy that can get away from pressure, but Sherwood here, who's a former safety in college, has really emerged in these last four years as a linebacker with Mosley down is kind of controlling the middle, welcomes him to the NFL. Yeah, that hit. That's the welcome. I'm thinking the same thing. Meanwhile, breaking tackles and able to pick up the first down is Gibson. Jets may be rotating some bodies in in the back end, but they're not changing their philosophy. They're going to be aggressive to that final whistle. It's just the DNA of this defense. Little screen here, but no blocking out in front of Gibson. Short game. Williams makes the tackle quenching. Makes you wonder about Hassan Reddick. Yes. At what point are both sides able to work this thing out? And can you imagine adding Reddick to this defense with Jermaine Johnson down? Mostly eventually comes back. Man, you'd like to see that worked out. Yad Reddick from Philadelphia, but holding out, wanting to trade, and the Jets say, no, we're not getting rid of him. We're not letting him go. Because now that Chuck Clark is coming along, you have D.J. Reid, Tony Adams, Chuck Clark. I mentioned Sauce Gardner, Michael Carter. That's a heck of a back end. Great linebackers with Williams and Sherwood and Mosley, and then that front's as good as you'll find. You had Redick in there, and that's terrifying. Third and two catches made. With Carl Johnson, the line judge comes right in there and see where they spot it. This is. In the meantime, that is the two-minute warning. Two minutes until the Jets are officially two and one. Great night for Aaron Rodgers. just in really command of this offense as you'd expect him to be. But that's the thing tonight. I mean, he got outside of that pocket, was 5 of 5 on the run. What a laser right there to Garrett Wilson for a touchdown. This offense will just continue to grow around him. Nathaniel Hackett, I think, putting the plan together, often criticized the offensive coordinator. And I thought Aaron told us this week, hey, he's a great coordinator when we go out and execute. And he's like, nothing makes me happier than to try to go out there and show people what kind of coach he can be. And it's a big night for him as well. He really wants to play well, Aaron said, to take some of the heat away from Hackett. Meanwhile, heat on May right there, and he gets sacked back at the 44-yard line. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS to the Patriots. 14 missed tackles. It's 100 yards that they lost tonight. That is, you could either look at it one way, the Patriots obviously got to do a better job of running the football and tackling. You could also look at it, the Jets did a heck of a job with yards after the catch, especially early in this game. With accurate passes, gives you those opportunities, but they did a heck of a job helping Aaron Rodgers out. Meanwhile, McDonald, number 99, who had three shots at Tennessee, has two and a half tonight. He has five and a half in two games. and with that injury to Jermaine Johnson, how great is that, and with Redick still sitting out. Third and 13, and working his way is Douglas, so they've been getting him into the game to some measure tonight. He's caught six, but just for 54 yards. Jeff Ulbrich told us this week that the two guys that he really thinks embody what this defense is about is Jamie and Sherwood, 44, who gives him now depth. He said he's so smart from now in his fourth year coming in as a safety and helping out. We've seen that tonight in for Mosley. And then it's Will McDonald in his second year getting bigger and becoming more of a complete defensive end. Me? You're big on that. You want to get that. Deflate it. And I want to get the touchback out to the 35-yard line. Those are your two things. There you have it. If I were commissioner for a day. Thank God I'm not Second and two 319 Rodgers takes the play clock all the way down And Hall sets up a third down And one You'll love this one Jets three offensive touchdowns In each of the first three games this year Last time they did that 1989 So So I don't want to jinx the Jets because I know it's been a tough run. But I think anybody's watching this game. We saw Buffalo last week against Miami, and I think we left that night in Miami thinking Buffalo's got a chance. They can stay healthy even without Diggs. The way they're playing together as a team, they could be dangerous. If the Jets stay healthy up front on that offensive line and Aaron Rodgers, it's going to be a fun year. It's going to be all about the health. Very interesting. and probing his way, getting the first down is Bree Saul, taking more time off the clock. In other news in sports, how about Shohei Otani tonight? Dodgers in Miami, 6-for-6, 3 homers, 10 runs batted in, 2 steals. He now has 51 homers and 51 steals. First player in Major League, is that right? First player in Major League Baseball history? The 50-50 club? That 50-50 club. I can't wait next year he's going to pitch on top of all of this. I don't think he gets the love that he deserves. It's better than when he was with the Angels. It's still not what he deserves. I live out west. He's getting a lot of love. West of the Mississippi. West of the Colorado, anyway. From the 20-yard line. Three-yard gain here. Chewing up the rest of the clock. Brees Hall, gain of three. The reason I think tonight's a big night, we're only at week three. It's such a long way to go. It's more than Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers has looked great. We've talked a lot about him. The movement, the command of the offense, the checks at the line of scrimmage, all that he normally does. I think it's the movement out of the pocket, but it's what's around him. Drake May looks like he may potentially come in. The line, the backs, the receivers, Mike Williams looking better and better. The tight ends, Conklin. Up the middle. Allen. By the way, early season trends. Took a look. The field goal was made. About 73 in one week. Yeah, crazy. 16 games. A lot of people talked about, and we talked about it last week, defenses, new trend right now is playing coverage. We talked to Aaron Rodgers about that. It's not just cover two, even though people have talked about that. It's just more of just putting a top on a defense, regardless of what the coverage is. But offenses are taking longer and longer to build the chemistry and the timing and the rhythm. And I've heard a lot of people talk, a lot of coaches talking about they don't practice in the offseason as much as they used to. So it takes longer to build that timing. Once again, took the play clock all the way down, tried to hit Wilson. That would have put him over 300 yards, but no. and it does indeed look like May is going to make his NFL debut. The only ball that Aaron Rodgers would probably love to have back. You know, that one he had an opening there in the seam and just didn't quite get it to Garrett Wilson and that's why he's, that one pass he's frustrated with himself. Hope that doesn't ruin his night. He's had a pretty good night. I doubt it. Morstead. His third punt of the night. Shorty fielded at the 35 and tackled at the 42-yard line. His mark is shown. So Drake May coming in to make his NFL debut. The rookie out of North Carolina with 420. So Drake May, the number three overall pick in the draft. Of course, Caleb Williams went number one to the Chicago Bears. There are his numbers. In Chapel Hill, he comes. This is not quite throwing him to the wolves here. I mean, the game is out of hand. But it figures to be fairly conservative, you would think. But let's see. Now they're going to start him with a pass on his first play. And nearly a pick. That would have been something. Michael Carter. Michael Carter from Duke, by the way. How much would he have loved that? There you go. To have a potential to intercept that. His first rep is an NFL player and telegraphs it a bit. and you could see the veteran Carter just kind of bait him and then step in front of it, almost comes up with it. And O'Shea coming in for the sack. And that will probably take us, and should, with an injured jet right now. Stopping the clock with five seconds. So you've got Morgan Moses, the right tackle, came over in a trade with the Ravens. Veteran in his 11th season, and right now in agony. It's every offensive lineman's worst fear. You get pushed into that backfield and you get rolled up on. It'll come from behind him as he's just trying to do everything that he can. His reaction tells us more than anything. There's that. Yeah. Get caught and there's nowhere to go. Not the end of the quarter, just an injury. We were in agony when we left it, but he hobbles off. He's been a real Iron Man throughout his career. He's only missed three games in 11 seasons. And Olufashnu, 2023 at Penn State, consensus All-American. He'll come in when we start the fourth quarter, but you say he should be winding the clock here in a second to take away the waning seconds of the third quarter. How about Vashenu comes in to play right tackle, and in college he played left tackle, and we saw Caden Wallace, who was a right tackle pinstead, play left tackle. All over the place, these guys. Into three. 21-3. New York. Three. From their own 46-yard line. And Roger Sills for a little swing pass. And again, just across the 50, Xavier Gibson making the catch there. So for Aaron tonight, 25 of 31, 257 yards, run for 16 yards, looks great out of the pocket, looks like he did five years ago. He looks so, and it's one thing to wonder how he's going to perform with his mind. We all know that, right? But I think the thing that's been great is we've seen that ball come out of his hand the way it used to. The velocity and the spin has been amazing in the accuracy. Fielded at the 12-yard line here. And running into a gang of green, Marcus Jones. Flag on this play. Back up at the 45-yard line. after the play was over personal foul unnecessary roughness kicking team number 19 that 15 yard penalty will be enforced from the end of the kick first down that's Irvin Charles who's been a special teams maven for these guys meanwhile Moses at least able to walk under his own power back to the locker room I mean right in front of the lead ref Right. It's like the guy in the white hat, you don't want to mess around. He's right there controlling the game. Totally. Got to be surreptitious. I mean, look at penalties now. The Jets. Up to eight now, I think. Yeah, over 100 yards. That's the only thing you could say that hasn't been cleaned for him tonight. So from the 31-yard line Pass offense 28 rushing yards 8-53 passing yards Tough night for Brissette Meanwhile, Stevenson, who's been great Has only carried the ball five times Now make it six for 19 yards Before that game And more action here now again Now you got a little It looks like the ball came out Maybe, yep Covered by the defense First down Covered by the defense So Chuck Clark Who had a big sack before Chuck Clark not only recovers it He rips the ball out Before the back is down I mean they might take a peek at this but Stevenson trying to hold on to the football, but it looked like as he was going down, Chuck Clark rips that football out of his hands. Yeah, that ball's out before he touched. What a play. That's confirmed. Chuck Clark, it's not about growing up, it's just about him stepping up with Whitehead, moving on to Tampa, getting more and more reps with his secondary. We saw a blitz.
