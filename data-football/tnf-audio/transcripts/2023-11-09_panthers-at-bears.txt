 And Gill down the sidelines, slurring the sidelines and takes it all the way into the flag down. And of course the Bears on the sideline, you can see the frustration here, the crowd now sensing what's going to happen. 79 yards. Heck of a job of hitting this and set up perfectly. Boy, special teams for Frank Reich here early in this game with the down punt inside the one and a huge return here. Perfect blocks to open it up. Watch this cut. He makes the initial move here. Now left and then up the middle. Perfectly designed. See the blocks there. They form that tunnel up to the middle. and got him to the outside, and the punter has no chance. You saw the flag come up the side, but there was no flag on the field. As it turns out, the kick is good. Play Eddie Pinheiro, and so on the fifth punt return of the season for a touchdown in the National Football League, the Panthers draw first blood, 7-0. Never occurred as it turned out, so there was a momentary waiting to make sure it was official, and it was, and the touchback will take the ball out to the 25-yard line. Bajit's still trying to settle into this game. Hasn't had great field position, but you and I, I think a lot of people that have watched him these last three weeks, kind of marveling at how poised he has played, but on a few of these third-down throws, his footwork hasn't been the best, hasn't looked settled, compared to the way he's looked again the last couple weeks. So he starts two for five, the 22 yards five years at Shepherd University in West Virginia born and raised in West Virginia play action here nice move and a 10-yard pickup by DJ Moore who looked Looks like he might be stopped there for a game of about two. So the former Panther picks up 13 in the first. And they use him in motion. He comes in, and then he works his way back out to the flat. And this is what Carolina knew all along. They know better than anybody. They've got to be able to tackle D.J. Moore. The Bears are not doing a great job with their vertical shots and the way Carolina plays defense. They're probably not going to have a lot of opportunities. It's going to come down to yards after the catch. and DJ Moore obviously can provide that. Back to the ground. Nice cutback move. And up to the 43-yard line goes Deontay Foreman. Second down and five. Five minutes to go in the quarter. You said five years. I think a lot of people get confused by that. He played. He didn't redshirt. He played five years because of that COVID year. And he started, if you go back to high school, he started three years in high school, five years in college, threw for over 17,000 yards. That's a ton of reps for a guy coming in. Very fortunate just to make an NFL roster. 319. 29. Play action. Ton of time. Flips it out here. Caught. First down. And into Carolina territory goes Foreman. Deontay Foreman led Carolina in rushing yards last year with 914. So he has bounced around Texans, Panthers, and now finding a home with Chicago. Just like Fitzy, he's bounced around. He's trying to hit every team in the league. Yeah, but he's effective. He's a power back. Dispatch with Beloved everywhere. Once again, great cutback move. And a 12-yard pickup and a crowd getting into it. Deontay Foreman already carried the ball six times tonight. The 32 yards looks over the bench and says, I need a breather. This offensive line is starting to mature and grow. I think Braxton Jones coming back at left tackles. Look at the center here. Lucas Patrick, 62. Really good block that time on Tuttle. Opened up that backside cut. And I tell you, Foreman known as a power back, but shows you he's got great vision and has some tricks to be able to make that cut back. Gets his shoe retied. Evans now comes in for a short gain Darrington Evans stopped there for a gain of a couple 320 and counting down in the first quarter in Chicago 7-0 Carolina on a punt return This is how the Bears want to do what we said earlier the reason these runs are important is get back to those first and ten play action passes it's what we saw from Fields when they played at Washington a few weeks ago to help them Absolutely breaking tackles here and picking up the first down Shuba Hubbard to the 15-yard line. Well, Frank, he got the job. David Tepper's on the team for five years has had five coaches. Last year, of course, Matt Rule started was in his third year. Steve Wilts took over. A lot of the players wanted Wilts to be retained, but he wasn't. That last game with two pick-sixers, how did you see him respond on this short week? Yeah, I mean, the guy is flawless. I mean, he's got ice running through his veins. There's no sweat. He's got a lot of resolve. He's ready to go. Having a good game so far. All right, Kaylee with Frank Wright. Meanwhile, that was Tommy Trumble, the tight end. Gordon makes the stop as we start the second quarter. Al Michaels, we prefer to see Kaylee Hartung in Chicago. 7-3 Panthers on top. Thanks to a punt return by Smith-Marset. Second down and 10 now from the 14-yard line. Young, 5 out of 8 for 53. On the ground again. Good tackle and losing his helmet. Hanging right in there. Jaquan Brisker knocking down Hubbard at the line of scrimmage. Third and long. You know, having Eddie Jackson and Brisker back is so big. You throw in Kyler Gordon. This secondary has been depleted. But this is what they can bring is the ability to be physical communication and getting downhill. I mean, you know this team wants to run the football. And you know Hubbard, especially between the tackles, wants to get going downhill even on second long. But, boy, they have missed 9 and 4 and 6 playing together back there. Third down 11. Incomplete. Pressure put on that time. Trying to get into the rookie, Jonathan Mingo, fourth down. Gawkway ends up getting home eventually with a twist move from the outside back to the inside. And keep bringing up. Montez Sweat gets a lot of attention. A lot of times they'll chip, they'll double team. It's going to create one-on-one opportunities elsewhere. And other guys got to step up. And Gawkway that time is able to affect that accuracy of that throw. Eddie Pinheiro this time. started his career with Chicago back in 19. Now tries to give Carolina a seven-point lead. 33-yard attempt. Hecker puts it down. Pinheiro bangs it through. And take off here. Chicago will take the ball at the 25-yard line. What about the Eagles right now? I mean, you guys are rolling, even though people say you haven't played your best game yet. What do you think? I think that's true. I don't think that we've really put together a full game, in all facets. And, I mean, that makes it even more remarkable 8-1. So I think if we can clean up things, we've kind of improved, right? We've struggled in the red zone early on. Then we struggle with turnovers and we've gotten better in each of those categories and that's what you want to see. I think this is the mark of the season and just improving as we go. Yeah, and a great matchup a week from Monday night is the Bears who are down 10-3, take the ball from the 25-yard line. Toss here goes to Foreman. So many things to talk to you about. The tush push, of course, everybody talking about it. Yeah. It's been used in the past from time to time. And you guys have now made it an art for them. Yeah. Just about the involvement of that with your team. Yeah, I mean, you know, there was a rule change that allowed a pusher from behind on quarterback sneaks. And we started doing this a year ago. And, you know, we've been very successful at quarterback sneaks since Nick Sirianna, even before Nick Sirianna with Jeff Stoutland. and it's something that's such a high percentage play for us. When you run it right and you do everything right and you hit the leverage, it's really, really hard to defend. Second down and seven here. Yeah, you're speaking for everybody around the league. It's very hard to defend the way you guys do it. Meanwhile, rolling and then throwing on the run, and the catch is made. It'll be about four yards shy of the first down. That's Cole Komet, and Komet turning it from four yards into a first down him closer to one yard. Two things on that push-to-short. Number one, you're at the bottom of that thing. What is that? Everyone always asks, what's your view? What's that like for you to submarine down and then you've got all that weight on top of you? What's your view of that? Yeah, you know, it's a grueling play. It really is. It's not a high-impact play, but it's a play that, you know, you have to get low on, but you can't get so low that your feet are going to stall out. We've got a quick snap on that one. Okay. Good. Instinct. No problem here. A little toss here. You got it, right? You're going to be in the booth next year if you want to be in the area. They got it. First down. So, yeah, I mean, you want to get low, but you want to be able to maintain traction with the ground and keep your feet moving. Because if your feet die out, you're not going to generate any push. Yeah. So, you know. First down here. Two to 25 goes Deontay Foreman. This defense and the defensive coordinator, Egero Eberow, is doing a very good job considering they've had, this is the time of the year where everybody's got injuries. I don't know if anybody's been hit as hard as this Carolina defense and the amount of stars that they have not playing and guys that would really contribute and be difference makers. Most notably tonight, Brian Burns not playing. So just trying to make do, and they're playing, holding their own tonight. Burns probably their best defender. They're also minus C.J. Henderson. Meanwhile, Bayesian looking for room and steps out of bounds. Second time in a row these first and ten play action calls, boots, get him outside. He's an athletic guy. He's comfortable throwing on the run. By the way, really good mechanics with his play fake. Sells it, looks at it, and then he's got room to get around the corner there and breaks contain, and now he's got that option to throw it or to take off and run and get a few yards. And there is Brian Burns talking about him. A lot of trade rumors surrounding him, but winds up staying in Charlotte at the end of the day. Second and nine. Through the middle. Big hole. Breaking tackles. Deontay Foreman. First down inside the 15. Boodle making the tackle. Really good block by Darnell Wright. The rookie right tackle out of Tennessee. 58. Watch him secure his block and be able to really lock in and get a good push. See Vaughn Bell coming down there. Actually, Tyler Scott picks him up. Very good execution on that right side. Right there, number one pick out of Tennessee. 23rd overall pick. Meanwhile, to the outside, Komet. And Komet takes the ball inside the 10-yard line where Deion Jones makes the tackle. And Komet has been, to me, the security blanket of Bay Jets these last couple weeks. He's targeted him 18 times. He has 16 receptions. Coming into tonight, had a couple scores last week, especially down here. What a target at 6-6 in the red zone. Go without a huddle, second and four. Getting close to a first down. Deontay Foreman. Every time I see Komet, you know, KME, I keep thinking, on Wheel of Fortune, Pat, can I buy a vowel? Just a beautiful Notre Dame tied in, though. Isn't it? That is it. It's the way the good ones look. 6-6, 260. Third down and one. Halfway through the third quarter. Here we are, lining up with the Tush Push. In honor of Kelsey. And for the moment, there's Komet on top of him. Kyle Komet is right there. And that's a first and goal. Yeah, he can handle that. Right, no problem. Komet takes the snap. Takes it. Good push by Foreman. By Foreman, right. And somewhere right now, Jason Kelsey is sitting here smiling. What's interesting, you would think Komet would be the guy pushing. Right. Not being pushed. Right. First and goal. Pass. Broken up. Pendant from Mooney. Dante Jackson for the moment saves the touchdown. A little second down and goal. Ball's thrown a little bit behind, but a good play and a reaction here by Dante Jackson. He's off to the left. You won't be able to see him until late right there. See that ball behind him? The right arm of Jackson's able to come through and bat that football away from Mooney. Great play. Give it to Foreman. And he's in. Deontay Foreman takes it in for the touchdown. Well, they were set up nicely after the punt. They go 38 yards. It's a four-yard touchdown. Nine plays, and Chicago takes the lead. Now, this is what he's known for, getting those tough yards, and he has to earn these yards, even though it's short yardage. Some good blocking, he gets hit there, he turns, and then Von Bell hits him before he gets to the goal line. And his momentum, and just his want, breaks the play and he gets that touchdown. Extra point by Santos is through. And with six and a half to play in the third quarter at Soldier Field, the Chicago Bears lead the Carolina Panthers. I think Bajan throws the ball like most quarterbacks in rhythm on those first and ten play action pass looks. Rolling right. A ton of time. Going deep. Incomplete. D.J. Moore trying to one-hand it in the end zone and could not. It'll be third down and seven. Beautifully named DiCaprio. Yeah. And he recognized the matchup against an inexperienced corner in Boodle. He's got D.J. Moore, his favorite target. Even though he is blanketed there, pretty good coverage by 32. He knows to try to give his guy a chance because he has that kind of confidence in him despite being covered in phase there by the young corner. Panthers minus C.J. Henderson starting corner tonight. Boodle will see more playing time. Third down and seven. Flushed out. Fires and the pass is incomplete. Trying to throw it on the run. So promising starts at the drive. That box down. Fourth down. In comes the hunting unit again. Or the field goal unit. Take your pick right here. And it will be a field goal from 49 yards. This time it will be from 49 yards out. Tyros Santos He'll put it down Santos' kick Good So two and a half And this time there is a flag It was fourth down and seven False start. Offense number 65. Five yard penalty. In play fourth down. Cody White here. You know, you're seeing more and more. You're seeing offside. You're seeing false starts on field goals every week. It's on the right side here. Our near side to us. Just a little flinch there on the end. And I tell you, that kick didn't make it by a lot. So you push him back five yards now to 54 yards. Let's see if he can have the leg to make this one. 154 and that one is inside the left up right and good the five didn't cost him Chicago gets its three two and a half and now it's looked like 90,000 yeah You were there last week. Yeah, I was. First down here for Carolina up to the 30-yard line, Raheem Blackshear. What's your memory from that game? Jaguar John Arnett. Nobody remembers. Out of USC, played for the Rams, 41-35. You had George Halas on one side. You had Sid Gilman on the other side. A few Hall of Famers played in that one. Impressive. Yep. Yeah, when we brought that up, you said, I was actually there at that game. We were like, wow, we've got to pull that video. And the Coliseum Hot Dogs were great. The Dodgers were better than that year, too. Are they still good? No. Well, they were better then. What can I tell you? Everything was better then. Second and six from the 29-yard line. Good play action. Throw. Caught down the sideline at the 25-yard line. Hold in by Mike Strawn. He was just activated. Third year out of Charleston. He's been around. He's on the practice squad. And that one is good for 44 yards down the sideline. How about that? Welcome aboard. Strong matched up against Brisker and just beats it. Gets outside leverage and runs away from him. And Frank Reich warned us about him on our call. He said he had him in Indy as a practice squad guy. Has a lot of upside and ability. It gives him that chance to get Chunk's plays downfield. 6'5", 225. I suppose his name is Mike Strahan, but it's pronounced Strawn. To the outside. That's caught. Thielen tries to escape. Does for a couple of extra yards. Kyler Gordon makes the tackle there. I know you've been around Frank Reich a long time, and I've watched him from afar and really appreciated him. I can go back and remember when he played for the Bills and made a big comeback win against the Houston Oilers. He was a great player, backing up Jim Kelly in those years. Watched him as an assistant coach. He gets an opportunity to become a head coach at Indy, and now here he is in Carolina. I found that call with him very refreshing and candid and honest. I thought he was very, and he told us about things that he feels and where they need to go, and he brought up Strawn and how he could. Rolling away, throwing, and that's incomplete. Pressure put on Montez Sweat, who just came over in the deal with Washington. They traded Sweat here and playing in his second game, and they need some help along that defensive front. They just have been putting no pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Yeah, that's what they're hoping to get with Sweat and how he could impact the entire defensive front for a defensive-minded head coach. But we'll talk a lot about Bryce Young and how a lot of this has fallen on his shoulders. We talked about it in the open, and I've got some thoughts about where he is and where he's headed down the road. Third down and seven. Four-man rush. hangs in the pocket. He can run and he shows you that right here as he picks up a first down. Getting out to the 31 yard line. Edwards and Sanborn in on the stop. We have our first penalty of the game and you'll hear from Cleet Blakeman for the first time in a moment. Defensive holding there that they'll probably decline with that scramble. Illegal contact. Defense number 33. Five yard penalty in the run. First down Carolina. Add that to the end of the play. But, you know, when he scrambles, more often than not, he scrambles to throw. In most of his career at Alabama, you would see him make this move, but he does such a good job of keeping his eyes open. Now, the one thing Carolina wants to avoid are these third and obvious passing situations. They want to help their offensive line, not just their quarterback, by trying to stay on schedule. Now, Miles Sanders is the running back, the ex-Eagle. Adam Thielen by far their leading receiver. Came over, of course, after nine seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. Kyler Gordon stops him there for no gain or a loss of one. Second down 11. They got him there showing a pre-snap. Looked like Kyle Gordon was going to bring the blitz. And that's why you wonder why he flipped that ball out quickly. He saw blitz. And then they ended up dropping. And then you had two defenders that were able to leverage the football out there in the flat. now in the backfield Raheem Vlaxseer their number three running back behind Hubbard and Sanders they flare him out pass to the left side is caught looking for extra room there getting it up to the 41 yard line Thielen again, Thielen not only is he a leading receiver he's leading by like a mile he has 40 more catches than the next that's where I was going to go next with Bryce Young I said in the open a quarterback's a reflection what he has to work with around him in his scheme You know, this is not a team that's figured out where they want to be. They were a pound-the-rock offense a year ago, and now you have an offense that's relying on a veteran, a 33-year-old, as their top receiver. So they've got a long way to go to, I think, improve around this quarterback position until you can really do a fair evaluation on Bryce Young. Third down and five. Again, getting a scramble and a run for a first down. So on both third downs, the coverage was good. He takes off, and he takes the ball to midfield in the first down here. Well, sometimes you stunt and move to try to affect the communication of this offensive line, and it can be effective, especially on third down against a Carolina team that has struggled. And other times, like Sweat here, you know he's the guy, but they move him to twist to the inside, and what that does, it opens up a nice vacancy there for Bryce Young to step up, and I'll tell you, he shows some toughness there, pulling away from Brisker off that arm tackle and knows exactly where he needs to go for the first down. Running back is Hubbard out of the pistol. Shoot a hover. And he takes it into Chicago territory at the 48-yard line where Zach Pickens makes the tackle. Carolina coming in with one win in eight games. Chicago has won two, including a victory. We saw them on a Thursday night as you look at Bajan on the sideline. And the best game of the season was 40-20 in Washington on a Thursday night. Yeah, we happen to do that to people, right? Bring out the best in those Chicago Bears. They look great that night. You and I were like, what's going on? Exactly. They got it figured out. Yeah, they looked like they were dead in the water. And all of a sudden, they went 40-20. Second down, seven. Rolling left. Throwing. And open, but too high. Incomplete. Had a man wide open. That's Terrace Marshall, Jr. He's been around. Third year out of LSU. Can't complete it. They're on another third down coming up. This is who I think they want to become. More of a play-action team. Look at all the orange jerseys up near the line of scrimmage. This helps the offensive line. It helps Bryce Young. I know he got pressure there late by Sweat. But throw on downs when they're not expecting it to give him a better chance. And I think Sweat just getting into his face with that length made that ball sail over top. Doing really well. 7-2. And, man, Joe Burrow, now that his calf is healthy, that offense looks like you'd expect it to look. Yep, started out slowly this year. Now they're rolling. Carolina from the 27th. And up here, gain of four. Hubbard, second down and six, under three to play. So Carolina 0-4 when scoring first this season. Chicago, 14 losses in a row, allowing the first score since last season. Of course, you know, these two teams, as we said at the outset, the expectations were not tremendous, but certainly disappointing to this point in the season. Trying to answer some questions as we head down the stretch of the year. Second and six, they swing it out here. And still, there's Mingo, third down. But my biggest concern with Bryce Young is who does he have to throw the football to? We know about Adam Thielen. But you tell me as you're watching, who scares you on the perimeter in this pass game right now? The rookie Mingo you just saw, he's more physical. Just acknowledging the crowd. He's played in every ballpark in America. State Farm Halftime Show coming up. Meanwhile, third down and three. and he was scrambling getting away from Ndakwe flag comes down Tyler Gordon tackled Jonathan Mingo here illegal contact defense number four five yard penalty automatic first down that was a third down and three they said four but Yeah, you'll see six, Kyler Gordon. He's actually against Strom, but he brings him down. You can see the speed. Again, Frank Reich told us what he could think. I think he probably felt indensible contact there, but I think he had his hands on him and helped bring him down. So Carolina catches a break because they were going to have to punt here and give Chicago some time to work to try to get more points on the board. Minute 54 First half from the 39 yard line On the ground Into the yard to show Shuba Hubbard You know the only score we have tonight A touchdown was that punt return This Bears defense You can say whatever you want about Bryce Young at Carolina Now that Matt Iberflues has a healthy secondary to go along with this run defense this is a pretty tenacious defense that he has when they're healthy. Second and eight, reaching up, making the grab. That time is Mingo, holding it in there, third down, third and one now. They only allow coming into tonight 3.3 yards a carry, which is the best in the NFL. Against the run. You now have Gordon back. Jalen Johnson's a great cover corner, 33. Brister and Jackson back at safety. So they become a different unit. And you bring in Montez Sweat as well. It's a complete defense. Yeah, their fourth in rushing defense. 28th in pass defense. Sanders is the back. He goes in motion to the outside. That pass is almost picked off. out in front of Mingo. That time it's Tyreek Stevenson, who can't believe he didn't come down with it. It's fourth down. The rookie almost comes up with a big play. He's the one guy I didn't bring up, and he's the most targeted corner in the National Football League, and he looks up late. That ball's out in front of the rookie Mingo, and boy, he came close to taking this one back if he ends up coming down with that football. He had blockers in front of him. And there's an example of the communication and that accuracy being off with Young and Mingo. Johnny Hecker, third punt of the night. Juggled, fair caught, and then action after the catch. That was interesting because Deshaun Jamison was there. The crowd wants a flag, but there is numbers. He was juggling it after calling for the fair catch. Here it is. that they make all over the world. Just very, very appreciative of those, obviously. It's great to celebrate them. Start this drive with a little over a minute. Roshon Johnson, now you've got a flag at the 23-yard line. Cleet Blakeman, his group not throwing a flag on that fair catch before there was a flop involved. obviously he's going to play the smart game here and try to pin Chicago back with the punters we knew coming in the punters would play a big part and turnover margin would play a big part sure enough that's definitely playing out here 10th punt of the game it's the 6th coming up off the foot of Hecker Taylor back for Chicago Calls for the fair catch And makes it as Jets Dolphins On prime Bears from the 11 Up by 6 Start this drive Little toss play here Nice night for Foreman And that continues with an 8 yard Scamper out to the 19 yard line So Deontay tonight 16 carries 69 yards And a touchdown You know, we talk about field position and complementary football. How about Carolina right now? They get a pretty good punt. You put Chicago back deep in their own territory. You've had seven drives tonight. One field goal and six punts. Frank Reich needs a short field for his own offense. Puts a lot of pressure on his defense to get Bajan and the Bears off the field and give them a short field. Second and two. picks up another first down here three yard run talking about Bajan all night long and there's his father who is a multiple arm wrestling champion, yeah that's what he did he's arm wrestled for decades running an arm wrestling league right now and when we talked to Tyson, I said, what did your father do beside arm wrestling? Nothing, this is what he did, he made all of his money He brought up three kids in arm wrestling competitions. What? In the 23-yard line. I think that's the thing you've been blown away by all week. You didn't know about that, man. Well, I mean. It's like bass fishing or something. Right. Hey, you can make money in anything. Make a lot of money. You kidding me? This guy. Look at this. Look at this guy. This is fine. He goes right-handed. He's excited. He's going to go back to the left now. He'll take any hand. It doesn't matter. Well, for years on Wide World of Sports, the world, they called it wrist wrestling championships, was a prime staple. There's Dad right there. Still looks like he could beat everybody else in the house, doesn't he? Oh, my God, Dad. Absolutely. Second and eight. Him and Witter going at it after the game. Meanwhile, Foreman starts to slip and then gets buried there by Derek Brown. Haven't called his name very much tonight. He's a real good defensive lineman who played in the 4-3 last year. And then Everett comes over. Rivera comes over and turns it into a 3-4. Well, he's known for his hands, obviously quickness and power. But he has such powerful hands. He just throws Jenkins. 320 pounds. And we just had to get at Smirk. He loved that. They move him around. He's been playing the shade in the past. Now he plays more head up. Third and nine. Pass caught. First down and a lot more to the 40-yard line. Goes Trent Taylor, but there's a flag down at the 34-yard line. That may have gotten D.J. Moore here with a pick. Discussion going on right now. He and Troy Hill hit each other. See what the officials... He said number two, which was the offensive player, and he pointed to the defense. There we go. It was a pick. DJ Moore is going to state his case, but it's a really good job of selling it. He's trying to get into Troy Hill's way, which he does. It opens it up to be able to make that throw to Taylor. But that's what the officials saw right there. That sums it up. One of the things that Bajit's doing a good job for for Iberflus right now, he's not making the critical error. And with the way his defense is playing, just manage this game and avoid that disastrous play. Third and 19. Draw here. Nothing. Crowd doesn't like the call, but on third and 19, what are you going to do? Roshon Johnson. The crowd still doesn't like the offensive pass interference. Goal fourth down. Well, once they got that far behind the sticks, you know, you're looking at a screen. And D.J. Moore now, I'm more than willing to cut this guy some slack. He's playing against a defense. He's making his fourth start. This guy was the fourth quarterback in camp. Undrafted, just trying to figure things out. And now here he is in for Justin Fields making his fourth start. beat Las Vegas, had a good first three quarters last week before the wheels came up. Deontay Foreman, we talked about the fact, and a very interesting guy, born and raised in West Virginia. There it is, his last hit opponents. Take a look at that, including Slippery Rock, Colorado School of Mines, and then he goes to the Vikings, the Raiders, the Chargers, the Saints, and the Panthers. The Colorado School of Mines, and then his first look is the Minnesota Vikings. Sure. That's a heck of a jump. That may be a new world record, that jump. Normal transition. Second down at eight. Blitz coming. Has to get it away, and he does. Fingertip grab there, but short gain. Foreman there. Deion Jones with the heat on. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Tyson Bajan has an unbelievable competitive spirit, according to his college football coach, to the point that during one training camp, Bajan challenged one of the team's athletic trainers, who was a gymnast, to see who could walk farther on their hands. At the end of every practice that summer, it was a contest. 50-75, up to 100 yards. His college coach, Ernie McCook, said it was the only losing record Bayesian's ever known to have until now. What was he training for? Cirque du Soleil? Passed down the sideline, is thrown out of bounds. Contented there for D.J. Moore. And very quickly, it is fourth down. I'm trying to figure out. She told me that story. I'm thinking, you're talking about 50 yards? 50 yards? I couldn't go five feet. I mean, that's not just something you pick up. I don't know if he was a gymnast as a youngster. That's impressive. I think it just tells you about his competitive spirit, right? Well, it's trying to figure anything. The craziness exists in the family, too. His father is an arm-wrestling champ. Good punt here, backing up to the 11-yard line. And this time they take care of Smith-Marset right away. The 9-yard line as the Panthers begin this drive out of the pistol formation. To the outside goes Sanders, and he gets taken down in the backfield. Kyler Gordon, one number six, takes down the other for a loss that time of six. Continue to watch these safeties. Now this is your slot corner, but Brisker, Eddie Jackson, and Kyler Gordon all making plays in space. Again, these guys have been injured the majority of the season, have all three now back on the field playing together. It gives this defense a very, very different look, much quicker in the way they react, better communication. Second and 16, they go five wide from the three. Rush four, pass to the outside into traffic, and completes at the nine-yard line. Dangerous throw. Blackshear makes the catch there. and that'll make it third down, third and ten. Obviously, with Bryce Young, you don't want to force anything down here. It's been a rough couple weeks for him. He hears the noise. He's trying to show a lot of maturity in dealing with it. There's a tendency to want to make a play down here. He threw that football. They're expecting those quick throws. Gordon came very close to jumping that and walking to the end zone. And Bryce, of course, threw those two pick sixes last week. third and ten under pressure he's going to go down back at the four yard line so the Bears last in the league in sacks and they're going to get one here as Yannick Ngakwe the well traveled end number 91 takes him down there fourth and 15 again it's great to see what Montez can do and you got a couple rookies in there right now with Dexter having a chance Jervon Dexter getting a push in the interior, which is so important. And Ngakwe gets a stop. Taylor is back to receive this kick. Short kick. Fielded at the 45-yard line. Can't take it down to the 36. So Chicago good field position here. 10-29 to play in the third quarter. And the Panthers on top by one. In the ballpark tonight. Meanwhile, this drive starts in Carolina territory with a pass that's complete. And looking to pick up that first down to coming very close is D.J. Moore. There is Mike Singletary. And every time I look at him, I think of the great shots of him when he was playing middle linebacker and those big eyes. That's what I think of, those eyes. And calling out to play. He's seeing something, and he's already calling it and about to make a big tackle. Second and one. One year at a time or one game at a time? Both. It's too hard to plan that far ahead. We'll see where we're at at the end of the season. But I know this. I'm having a lot of fun. The league has changed a lot. The way they prepare and everything that allows older guys to flourish and be ready on game day. We're sure having fun right now. Second down and 10. and that pass is incomplete for a stuttering start on this drive 10 and 4 Thielen you know what he's done Kirk he's made center a glamorous position no doubt about that I was reading something in one of the Philadelphia publications you were the most popular athlete in Philadelphia and Bryce Harper was second and you were way ahead of James Harden and Ben Simmons you ran those guys out of town I was shocked to see that. Yeah, I'm very fortunate to be in a city that loves the big uggies up front, no doubt about it. The big uggies. Oh, to Keith Jackson. Four sections men alive, I think. Third down and ten. Swallowed up at the two-yard line. Justin Jones comes in there. So the Bears have had a ton of trouble getting any sacks this season. pick up on your fourth down at 17. They don't double team, but they do chip right here to try to keep Montez Sweat out. But it creates some one-on-one opportunities. And Glockway actually forces him to step up. But once he does that, Justin Jones, the one returner in this entire front seven, he's able to be kind of the beneficiary, able to get off that block by the center Bozeman, and he gets the sack. Johnny Hecker, those 10 years with the Rams, ended with a Super Bowl win against Cincinnati a couple of years back. Backing up 42-yard line. Trent Taylor, nowhere to roam to the 46-yard line. And of course, Jason Kelsey is with us because the Eagles have a bye. Kansas City has a bye. And those two teams will meet on Monday Night Football. Being a one out to the 50-yard line. One of the things I want to ask you about is the culture. We always hear that word culture, but when we travel around, we get a chance to go into the facilities and meet with you guys as players. I remember leaving Philly this year and talking to Al and Tegan, man, there's just something different there, like the ownership to the GM, to the head coach, all the way to the training table. Everything is just run in a first-class manner. You talk about that and you being in the middle of all that culture? Yeah, I mean, listen, we inherited a good culture. We had many teams before we were there, and the Eagles more than other teams. We've had down years, but they do a great job of keeping key components there, whether it be coaches, whether it be front office people, whether it be players. So there's never a wholesale rebuild. There's always some semblance of age and wisdom, as well as bringing in youth and enthusiasm and talent. Great man. I think it really helps, you know, maintain that culture throughout these changes. And, you know, that's kind of the natural progression throughout the league. So, you know, it's a kudos to the front office and the Eagles organization for doing it that way. It's impressive. Yeah, it's nice to have an owner for a quarter of a century because Jeff Lurie took over back in the mid-90s. Third down and five, so a lot of stability. and then picking up the first down Roshan Johnson and Howie Roseman there's always been a good feeling around that Philadelphia the facility, just everything about it and it's a tough time of course to play in they want you desperately to win it's a tough time to play in but it's a time that will reward you like no other I mean they're going to be rough on you when it's down but I don't know that there's anybody that's going to love you more when you're doing it right and representing it the way they are going to hold you to represent it. And, yeah, when it's working, there's no place better. No doubt about it. Rolling out. Throwing back the other way. That's incomplete. I have a question for you in terms of, you know, obviously what you did in the Super Bowl parade and the way you got up there. Have you picked out your outfit if you guys win the Lombardi this year? Oh, man. I don't usually pick my outfits out until really the day before. So this is a good effort. Yeah, this one was pretty good. Did you come up with this on your own? So I this so mummers parade is a huge thing in Philadelphia on New Year's Day. And I'll never forget the first time I ever saw it. Like, what the heck is this? And, you know, my hair stylist, my barber, Libby, her husband is a mummer. Sixteen. Ten. On time. Chicago kicks off and Young and company will start from the 25 yard line meanwhile a lot to talk about in terms of the trade Ryan Poles with Chicago they have a treasure trove look at this I mean not since I think Willie Sutton was robbing banks did you see something like that the Panthers picking up the number one pick they got Young giving up Moore the number nine overall pick the 10 second round pick 24th first round pick fourth round I mean On and on we go. And there are pieces on this defense already that you like about where they are and where they're heading. And then you add on what they're going to be able to do in the next year's draft, not just in the first round, but really the first four or five rounds. They've got a lot of fits. From the 25-yard line. Young. Under pressure. Overthrows. Feeling the intended receiver second down. The fact they get that Carolina first pick, how big is this to not just beat them tonight, but give them another loss and try to secure yourself. You can already see if the season ends today. Look, they're getting second to the third pick. Who knows where this thing ends up by the time the season's over. And for the moment, the Cardinals would get that first pick. There's, of course, Justin Fields. Question here in Chicago is, is he the guy down the line? Already third year, missing his fourth game tonight. and figures to play when they resume action away from Sunday. Second down and 10. Fired over the middle court, and that's going to be enough for a first down. Terrace Marshall. Yes, that's how he pronounces his first name, Terrace. No end in that first down here. How a rare opportunity where there's not a push in the face of Bryce Young. Actually had a chance to look and evaluate, to be able to navigate the interior of that defense and make a good throw. Fired, caught, after the 50-yard line. Thielen, well, you've been watching him since college. I mean, boy, he gets rid of the ball a little flick. Yeah, he does, and he also worked a lot of tempo and a lot of no huddle when he was in Alabama with Bill O'Brien, who's now the offensive coordinator for the Patriots, and this is where he's most comfortable. This is where I think Carolina's going with the future of their offense with Bryce Young. In the pocket, under pressure, buying time, and it just fires into the Chicago bench, second down. The problem you have is, we talked earlier in the first half, who are the receivers? You can really say this is going to be a receiver that Bryce Young can work with for a number of years. Adam Thielen right now is 33. He's having a great year. He catches a lot of possession routes, short routes. Nobody else really, unless Mingo can come on as a rookie. There's nobody there, even a tight end. They've got to be able to grow around him. They've got to give him a chance the way Jacksonville's done with Trevor Lawrence, with the pieces they brought in around him. And they've got to get better up front. You want to play better at quarterback, you've got to have better pieces to work with. Apart from that, they have nothing to do. Second down and ten, you've got to play here. They could use D.J. Moore. A full start. A player like that. Number 79. 5-0-10, ladies. Still second down. 1-0-D. That flag there. Notable overall number one fix. You know, you go through Stafford, Goff, Burrow, Lawrence, and Young. Take a look. All of those guys started out 1-6, 0-7, 1-5-1. So it's like, you know, again, as I said at the beginning, in today's world, it's a rush to judgment. Second and 15. That's not held that time by Thielen, the almost always sure-handed one, third and 15. And your point is well taken as far as how quick he makes decisions. That's why I think everybody looked at him as the top of the rookie quarterbacks in the draft. He has great vision, great field vision, makes quick decisions, and he's accurate. I know he's slight, he's 5'10", and he's about 185 pounds, but you make quick decisions, and you're accurate. That's why that's a hot commodity. Third and 15, two deep safeties. That's on pass score by Mingo. And they know who was their number two draft choice last year. They didn't have one. Eddie Jackson makes the tackle. It's fourth down, fourth and three. Even in plus territory in a field position game and a one possession game, Frank Reich on. Doesn't give up. Hits the ball right there. And somehow Bajan's able to hold him off right there with one hand. The ball actually left his hands. He's able to secure it. But I'll tell you what's impressive. They started that drive in their own nine-yard line. And instead of shutting it down and just saying, let's go in at 10 to 6, they decide to get aggressive, and they put themselves in obviously great position to get three points. Tade plays on the drive. Only took a minute and nine. 39-yard attempt now. And that kick is good. So three field goals for him. That's the end of the first half. The score is 10-9. I think that's been something that's going to really behoove him, Tony, as time goes on. So here you go. In a game, get into the fourth quarter. In fact, Frank Reich said just be special for two or three plays late to Bryce Young. Keep it close. Be special a couple times late, and let's win it. Panthers get the ball from the 25. Here's Kaylee. Well, Coach, your defense is only allowed three points. Why have they been so successful? Yeah, they're just playing together. You know, it's continuity. They're playing together, and they're really executing well today, doing a good job on third down. Tyson Bajan looked his best on that last drive of the half, but what does he need to do to get in the end zone? Yeah, he really did a nice job on that last drive, as you said, and we're excited about this second half. We've got some things up our sleeves, so, all right? Oh, a little tease. A little tease. So don't touch that dial. Here's some stuff up their sleeves. Chuba Hubbard is the running back here. Young rolling, firing, and that pass is incomplete. And right now, Young has started this game 7 out of 15 for 63 yards. So where Carolina is with Thomas Brown, and Colin plays now for the third game and a new head coach, they are still in transition mode from who they were as an identity last year where they're running downhill, being physical, to now having a first pick overall with a quarterback that's more familiar and comfortable with a spread, shotgun, pistol, a play-in-space, up-tempo kind of game. And it's like they had one foot in and one foot out on where they were and where they're trying to go. Sanders went to the Pro Bowl as he filled off the Eagle last year. They found him expendable. Signs here as a free agent, third down and nine. Yeah, he's had some injuries to work through here after that big year last year. A groin, a pack, a shoulder. but last week he got back on track made some plays in the pass game ran the football with a little bit more juice and he and Hubbard are supposed to give them a really good 1-2 combination in that backfield 3rd and 9 opening drive of the second half Soldier Field in Chicago in the pocket and throws, and that's batted away. It's incomplete. You got Stevenson there. Kirk mentioned before, he is the most picked-upon corner in the league. They try to go after him. You'll see Eddie Jackson just kind of trying to play games with the quarterback, just kind of sitting there as a robber in case he's going to throw it over the middle. He elects to go to that one-on-one matchup. He thinks he's got a chance here. but Marshall is known again a little stutter and go to go down field but tight coverage that time by Stevenson didn't allow him to get down field and he got his eyes turned and found that football. Johnny Hecker's fourth punt of the night forthcoming and meanwhile you have a flag here as the play clock was at double zeros. Offense. My job, Kelly, go for it down Hmm Some stuff just needs to be said we go you take a delay a game on a pond on the three Huh, that's what we go. That's where we are. Yeah, we are folks. You know what we're talking about And that one is almost blocked Gets it away and skids out of bounds at around the 28-yard line. Well, you look at this first half for Tyson Bajent. Just trying to feel his way here in his fourth start. A lot of times he had time. Here he doesn't find his intended target. An open man downfield has to check it down. At times he just looked like he's been a little bit out of sync with his footwork. Hasn't been as comfortable as we've seen in recent weeks. Another man underneath. You see the frustration there. from the toss. They have deferred. Tyler Scott back to receive. Eddie Pinheiro puts the ball in the air in week 10. He underway Scott from the two And back out to the 25 line And so our first look tonight at the quarterback who was number four in training camp Tyson Bajit played a shepherd, as Kirk mentioned, at the top. Three touchdowns, six interceptions. The numbers aren't good, obviously, when you look at that. But he has really shown some flashes of brilliance. Yeah, for a young guy that came in, as you said, number four, lucky to make the team and ends up all the way up to the backup to Fields and ends up getting some starts, he's looked like a guy that understands the scheme and is in command of what they're doing. Fake to Foreman, pass is caught. D.J. Moore, who played with Carolina last year, was part of that big trade, picks up 16. So Carolina did not want to get rid of D.J. Moore, but had to to make that trade so that Carolina could wind up with that number one pick and picks up 16 right off the bat. Talking all week what he would be like, how excited he is to go up against his former teammates and how often they're going to get him the football and first play out. Bajan says, let's go to two and let him do his thing. He's so dangerous after the catch. From the 41-yard line. with a little bit of motion. Good protection. Fired incomplete in and out of the hands of Darrington Evans to make a second down and 10. So there is Justin Fields. They had hoped he'd be ready, and he was listed as possible to play tonight, but they took him down yesterday for good. They do have that week and a half now with this mini bye, so they'll have 10 days to heal up completely. Yeah, I think that'll be big. They were very close, but, you know, really the last couple weeks he's been close. But having a Thursday night game in a short week gives him that extra rest for that next game next week. Through the middle. Foreman, who played with Carolina. He picks up just a couple, so it'll be third down. Third down and eight. The thing I found interesting talking with Tyson Bajant this week when we had our chance to visit with him was just how he prepared in the shadows when he wasn't even thought to be a guy. Working after practice, he told us one time he was behind the first team offense with his helmet on, getting the calls and going through the motions as if he was the starter, not knowing he would eventually become that guy. So he did all the little things right to prepare himself. Third down and eighth, protected well, throws, knocked away at the last moment. intended for Cole commit and broken up in the secondary. So they pick up a first down on the first play of the game, and now it's fourth and eight, and then comes the punting group. Yeah, on one hand, you like to see him get the ball out in a hurry. On the other hand, he's got to be careful with Dante Jackson, the corner. Sitting back, he shows man coverage and then comes off of it. Does a good job with his eyes anticipating this throw, and you see both Panthers there, but I think Jackson, if that ball's not tipped, has a chance to intercept it. Trenton Gill, 45.5-yard average to punt, backing up Amir Smith-Marset. He lets it bounce, and it skids through the end zone. So now here is your top draft pick. In the 2023 draft, Roger Goodell was there saying the Carolina Panthers have chosen Bryce Young, won the Heisman in his next-to-last season at Alabama, Born in Philadelphia, grew up in Southern California, wanted to go at one point to UCLA. Then he committed to USC and winds up going to Alabama, wanted to go away to school and grew up, as he said. And indeed he did under Nick Saban down in Tuscaloosa. I had a chance to call a lot of his Alabama games. The thing I would call him is a flatliner. The only time I've ever seen him show emotion is the other day on the Zoom telling you he's excited you're about to call his game. Like his grandfather. Two-yard gain here for Chuba Hubbard on the first play from the scrimmage. It'll be second down. And the one good thing, though, they've only won one game. But they did beat Houston in that game. So, of course, he's now being matched up with what C.J. Stroud is doing. And he's killing it in Houston. But he did beat Stroud in that head-to-head matchup. Yeah, and I think that's really got a lot of attention about what's happening with him. It's not just what Stroud's done. You could even say what Will Levis did last week in Pittsburgh in our game. and even Anthony Richardson, the way he started with Indianapolis. So I think everybody's looking and waiting, and that's why it's intensified. Play action. And the Avalon String Band shout-out, guys. And, yeah, we reached out and said, you know, do you have a suit that might fit? Because if we're going to do a parade, we've got to do a Philadelphia style. And little did I know I'd be wearing something to make, you know, RuPaul proud. You know, it was really nice. You'd have been the toast of the Mardi Gras as well. That's right. There you go. Lee Corso was here today. That's a beauty. Cole Komet made that last catch. It's third down and four. There are the numbers on. Baygent, eight out of 15 for 69. Taking away the throws downfield. He's done a nice job of showing patience and just checking it down. Let the back do the work if it's taken away. Going deep down field. Contested pass, contested catch, and incomplete intended for Mooney. Dante Jackson covering on the play. Fourth and fourth. What did you guys learn about yourself last week? That game got a little bit closer there at the end than probably you thought it might be. But rivalry game, Dallas always talked about. You played in that game so many times. For sure. And, you know, a lot of our games have been close. It starts with the opening game of the season for us with the Patriots. And, you know, Nick's whole mantra the whole week, you had Bobby Knight in that quote of, you know, victory favors the team that makes the fewest mistakes. And don't get me wrong, we had a share of mistakes, but we had few enough that we were able to pull out the game. Bears going for it on fourth down and four, trying to keep the drive alive. And they do to the 22-yard line. The pass is caught there by Tyler Scott. Well, the guy that he typically looks for in these situations the last couple weeks is the tight end. The tight end that stays in and eventually clears. When he clears, you see the linebacker go with him. Once that linebacker went with him, it opened up a nice throwing lane. And the last guy anybody thought was probably going to get the ball in a fourth down play is Tyler Scott, who's really known more as a speed guy, a vertical threat. That time showed some great toughness taking that hit after the catch. Evans the running back instead on an end around this time D.J. Moore nothing happening there to the 20 yard line 4.5 to go in the half second down finding a way to keep this drive alive those rocket screens on first and 10 some play action just enough again to try to offset things and break some trends that they've had these last few weeks so the other thing he's doing is when he has time he's patient he checks it down but often on these play-action looks as a young quarterback, simple reads just get the ball out of his hand quick Betsy sending in the play second and nine Evans stays in as the running back down to Evans he gets to the 18-yard line stop there by Dante Jackson third down well man, we're going to leave you after we go to the commercial You have been here long enough to now be fully vested in the after-pension plan. It's good to know. Hey, man. I'm going to take all that I can get. Terrific. Hey, you were great. No, this is a blast. It's so fun to see all this stuff and an honor to be with both of you and watch your work, man. Good luck, rest of the way. Enjoy your off week. Thank you. Can't wait for that Monday night game. It's going to be fantastic. Third down and seven. Able to handle the errant snap, and then the pass is incomplete. And it will be fourth down that time. Von Bell came blitzing from the secondary, so it's fourth down, and in comes the field goal group. Really good simulated pressure there. They show one look and go to another, and the veteran Von Bell, he and Xavier Woods have been out. You put those two together, you bring the communication to the back end, and allows you to dial up some exotics, especially on third down. They called that at the right time there. Carlos Santos, 36-yard attempt to try to make it a four-point game. And he does. What do you think the real weight is? I mean, all the years that I watched him in Alabama, I always thought he was in that 185, 190 maybe, tops kind of range. He's very slender. You know, his bone structure. Those other guys are much more stout. They're not tall, but they're stout. Blacksher takes it to the 27. So next week, we've got a beauty for you. Going to Baltimore. So Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. Red hot. Joe Burrow and the Bengals. Red hot. Cincinnati and Baltimore on Thursday night football. Next week. And Mark Jackson settling in with a new offensive coordinator. In order to get low, keep your feet moving, that takes a lot of energy. And then you just end up at the bottom of a pile of large, large human beings. I mean, I got Landon Dickerson, who's north of 350. Jordan Mlado is north of 370. And those guys end up on top of me a little bit too often. Oh, that's beautiful. Effective, though, right? Yeah. Take one for the team. That's right. First out for Chicago here from the 37-yard line. and the inside end around to Tyler Scott. Beautifully designed play, and Scott rambles into Carolina territory for a first down. Tunyon leads his way around. He's known as the guy that can make great catches. Watch 18 from the left lead his way around. Good first and 10 play call. You expect the Bears to be more conservative. This kind of fits into that play action on first and 10. Just a wrinkle or two to slow this defense down and make them have to appreciate other aspects of how they can attack. So for the 47-yard line, patient 5 of 10 for 53. The ground again this time. The defense is right there. Sometimes I feel like I've got to be Billy Bush on Access Hollywood. Where's your brother? Yeah, you and me both. It's something new every week. Yeah, I'm sure he'll pop up somewhere this bye week. But, yeah, he's purposely leaving me out of what's happening. He knows my mouth is a little bit too big these days. Getting a little bit too much media coverage. He's not in Argentina, is he? I don't know. I'd say nothing. It's kind of like, where's Carmen Sandiego? He'll pop up somewhere. Yeah, I'm sure he will. Great answer. I love that. And Mama Kelsey's enjoying her little short turn here, is she not? Yeah, oh, she's doing fantastic. I mean, that's been one of the most enjoyable things. flag comes in you saw that tackled at the 40 yard line this time is that going to be a sink Brown Tevin Jenkins a very highly regarded right guard he's got his hands full tonight against Derrick Brown in that pass set you know better than anybody against Derrick Brown what he can do he's actually moved from a 4-3 to a 3-4 from being a nose guard to now being out more as a defensive end in that 4-I where he can really be effective. He said he's still kind of transitioning, dealing with that two-gap defense as opposed to a one-gap where he can get in and get penetration into the backfield. I think he's probably being a little humble. We played him two years ago, and he figured that out. I thought he had to figure it out back then. Second on 20, Roshon Johnson is the back. Play action. Deep flat. Plenty of time. Pass incomplete. The 48-yard line of Roshon Johnson, third and 20. And you heard the crowd react to Tyler Scott working down the middle of the field. He just gets free right down the middle. Watch here. Safety busting coverage. And right there, Baygent really not recognizing him. It's one thing to sit here and watch it up here for the fans to see it. But if he's not in your progression, you're not going to see it. Now, if you're a veteran quarterback, maybe a guy like Jalen Hurts, maybe you see that, you work through it and recognize it quickly. But Baygent making his fourth career start as a rookie, he's just trying to make the right read and get the ball out. Third and 20. Catch made here by Roshon Johnson. and we've got another flag down another hold here against the Chicago according to what every Carolina defender thinks Cleet Blakeman passing appearance offense number two that penalty's decline he's up for it down DJ Moore when you have a rookie quarterback like Bajan, the guy wasn't drafted that he came into camp, fourth guy. If you're a lineman, a veteran like you, what do you do to try to help him? Can you do that? Oh, for sure. In the center, you're in charge of the communication set and a lot of the blocking assignments. Anything you can do to take a little bit off of his plate, let him focus on the things that really are going to allow him to succeed and flourish. And, you know, whenever you have a young guy back there, those are the things you're focused on. Gild to punt Smith Marceau ran one back all the way for a touchdown close to the fair catch, juggles it and then recovers at his own 10 yard line, that's where Miles Sanders former Philadelphia Eagle is the running back, Jason Kelsey is in the booth with us on his bye week and that pass is thrown away so have you decided you're playing next year or not? I'm one at a time Yeah, up for the target. Young has run for first downs on the prior two third down plays. This time he fires it out of bounds. Coverage was good. That time Montez sweat again. They got him to put some pressure on from the defensive front. He's done exactly that fourth down. Yeah, offensive line doing a pretty good job on these third downs. whether they were protecting or at least giving them a chance to be able to step up. Again, this has been a problem for them. They have 29 sacks on the year, and a lot of that has been in straight drop back. But here early against this defensive front, holding up pretty good to at least give them a chance to try to execute there. Johnny Hecker is the punter. Of course, he's a veteran of 10 years with the Rams, now in his second year here. Trent Taylor back to receive. he sets up at the 15th close with a fair catch and it's down at the 1 yard line so a perfect kick Sam Franklin downing it at the 1 pinning Chicago deep in the first quarter looking for some space here and Bajan able to provide it with about a 3 yard carry out to the 4 yard line this is going to be one of those games where the turnover margin special teams field position will go a long way in deciding who wins it. How Baygent handles this. Doesn't have a ton of experience. They need to get a first down here. Give their punter potentially some room here. Chance to flip the field back. But Carolina downing them inside the one. Excited to see how Baygent handles this. Foreman is the running back. Deontay Foreman. Looking good over the past couple of weeks. He'll take that ball out to the 10-yard line. He's in his fifth year. Plays are being called by Luke Getze. There he is, the Bears' offensive coordinator. Came in last year. Came in with Iberflus, whose pedigree is defense. And in the absence of Allen Williams, who left a couple of weeks into the season because of a workplace issue, Iberflus now calling the defensive signals. Third down and two. To the outside. That's caught. Can he get the first down? Yes, he can. Darnell Mooney. So the escape had the ball at the one-yard line. Get a first down here and plenty of breathing space now out to the 15. They brought Troy Hill from the field. Good job at recognizing getting that ball out quickly and being able to see. You see 13 there on the right there. He blitzes. Now you get the ball out to a quick receiver. Mooney, good block there and a good effort being a good teammate there by D.J. Moore, helping him get to the edge and get that first down. Inside handoff. Four-yard gain here for Foreman. Make it second down and six. Khalil Herbert started the year as their number one back. He got hurt. They thought he might be able to play tonight, but still he is out. And for that mini-bye, of course, for 10 days to get everybody healthy, he'll be one of them. Yeah, fortunate to have Foreman. He fits in well with what they want to do, that downhill running style. Second and six. Again. Another four-yard pickup. Third down. Yeah, Luke Getze, who you just talked about, this is what they want. This is who they are for right now. You know, you've got a young quarterback. Even when Fields is in there, an offense is trying to find weapons to be able to stretch the field with bringing in a guy like D.J. Moore. But for right now, they want to live in that second and sixth and third and two. Manageable down and distance for Baygent to be able to really be under control and making good decisions. Third down and three from the 23-yard line. Mooney in motion. Baygent throws, and that is incomplete. So they're stymied here after one first down. Then they'll kick it away on fourth down. You know, you're right. You're talking about they want to run the ball, set up those, you know, short yardage situations on third down if they can, which they did there, and then they throw the ball. But that's been the Chicago Bears for a century. Run the ball, stop the run. Yeah, and Matt Eberflus brings that. In fact, when we talked to Frank Wright, that's the first thing he said. We talked to him about keys. He said, well, first of all, they're going to try to stop the run. They're one of the best in the league, and they want to establish the run on their side. We've got to match that physicality. Trenton Gill. Fields at the 24, escapes. Nice run back. Only one man to beat. Puts to a foul. That's a very roughness. Defense, number 40. The team runs that way. First down. That's Deion Jones. Johnson going down. Jones going down with him. Oh, man. The anniversary of here Signed as a free agent 65 seconds now from the 30 yard line first down Deep drop Pass Underneath the 35 DJ Moore Second down and a Timeout taken here Open that door I was like This is our spot It had a little buzz A lot of buzz I'm not dancing alone. What are you talking about? Second and four. From the 36. Takes the throw. Runs for a first down up to the 44-yard line. Goes Beijing. And timeout taken here again. Haynes making the tackle. So they're down to one timeout. Trying to at least set up for a field goal at the end of the half. Put that ball away. He does a good job of seeing man under coverage, so he's got an opening. But when he's taken off running initially, that ball is away from his body, and then they hit him hard. Fortunate he's able to hold on to that football. I love that Matt Eberflew is showing confidence in this young quarterback. Even though it hasn't been a great first half with only the two field goals, they know this is going to be more than likely a one-possession game late. By the way, he's 1-9 in one-score games as a head coach. He's trying to get three more points here on the board. He's got one more timeout to work with in 50 seconds. Big time of possession advantage. 37 plays to 24. And that pass is caught along the sideline. And a first down here for D.J. Moore. Stopping the clock with 46 seconds. He sees soft coverage, and he's got a matchup that he's got to take advantage of. He went to it earlier in this game. It was a go-ball downfield. This time with the soft coverage with Boodle. Hadn't played a lot of football. That's pitch and catch to D.J. Moore. Got the ball out right on time, even before he turned. Be able to get his two feet down. Positive yards and get out of bounds. To the outside. Short game here. A tackled inbounds clock keeps running. Equinomia St. Brown racing up to the line of scrimmage. going to hold that last time out. Trying to anyway. Clock rolling down to 30. And inside a half minute now. Paging in the pressure. Throws to the sideline. That's incomplete. Then a stop to clock with only 20 seconds now. Still preserve that one time out, but that took a lot of time. Yeah, not only that, his instincts took over. He ends up rolling right, and he had four receivers left. The only receiver he had to the right was DJ Moore. He tried to go downfield and then work his way back. Good tight coverage and a good job overall by that Carolina defense. Third and six. Again, very deep drop Pass underneath to the 30-yard line And inside goes Komet and stops the clock by going out of bounds With 12 seconds Cole Komet who caught two touchdown passes last week They lose him because they blitz right here with Troy Hill Watch Komet actually helps initially. Just a little chip and then a release. Bajin at the last moment is able to recognize him. And this is what you like to see from the big man. 6'6", 260. Being able to make some positive yards after the catch. And again, getting out of bounds. 12 seconds. Bajin. Look out from behind. avoids the sack, holds on to the ball, slides to a stop at the 19. Three seconds, and they can't take the timeout here. So they save the timeout, and that saves them the opportunity to come in and try to make it a one-point game. When Leota came so close to knocking this football loose, gets around Braxton Jones with a good initial burst off the line. In their last game, turned it over five times, didn't allow a sack tonight. Didn't allow an offensive touchdown. The only TD they gave up was the punt return. But the two quarterbacks didn't embrace there. The great thing that Baygent did is he managed the game. He didn't throw for a ton of yards, managed the game, didn't turn it over, and that's why they had a shot. The NFL at defending the run, so it's not just about that pass rush. Second game in this uniform. Meanwhile, this drive starts with nothing. Hufford taken down there by Kyler Gordon, who's been in on a lot of tackles tonight, second and ten. I think that not only Gordon being healthy and Briscoe being healthy, but they're both in their second year to go along with a veteran, Eddie Jackson, back there. So second year in the system allows you to play faster, better understanding. You throw in the health, the continuity. It's a beautiful secondary now, and they're all healthy and playing the way they are. Oh, in the middle. That's caught. And then thrusting forward is Adam Thielen trying to pick up the first down close. Linebackers separated. And the great thing that Bryce Young does here, gets the ball out of his hands. And that's what Thielen is so good at, just finding that soft spot in the zone to settle in there. Bryce Young, that's his target. That's his guy. Gets north and south. Comes very close to picking up that first down. Spotted a yard shy, third and one. Six minutes left in the four. Can he get the first down? Close. But Chicago says no, that's Hubbard. Official comes in. Yellow line is right there. You know it's unofficial. You've heard it 10,000 times. Just no push at all. Andrew Billings, the apex of that defense, holding his own, did not budge at all. In Carolina, they're gonna have to go for this Bears allowing the fewest yards per carry in the league 3.3 So they're gonna line up at least to go for here fourth and inches Indeed they do young on a roll young is gonna run for the first half and get it So they keep it That could have, in effect, not ended the game, but it would have made it very difficult for Carolina to come from behind. Remember, this isn't Jalen Hurts trying to run the tush push there. You got a small quarterback that not going to be able to get those yards so you roll him away from that interior and all those big bodies and give him a chance where he has the option to find somebody in the flat or use his speed to get to the corner There's not that much push to push. That's right. From the 20. Fires over the middle. Six yard gain. Hayden Hurst. the tight end. He's been quiet tonight up until now. Second down and close four. Watch him move T.J. Edwards here. Here's your quarterback. He's going to move this linebacker right where he wants him to go. Just a little thing here. Give him a little shake and he opens it up. Make a quick throw. Good job. Love that shake. Just enough. That's dropped. Would have been a first by 20. And he goes back to Hurst, who had just made that last dash. He's shaken up on the play. Needs some help from Corbett to get up. And it's going to be third down and three. Brister again making that big hit. Ball a little bit behind him. But at this point in the game, you've got to be locked in. He took that route and kept continuing through the middle. And I think Bryce Young was expecting him to just turn and settle. And that reaction on Young said it all. Third and three. Thielen had been lined up in the backfield. Then they throw it to him. As he circles out of the backfield and picks up the first down. So the leading receiver comes through in the clutch right here. Edwards makes the tackle. Here's the blitz right here. Watch. Thielen's lined up in the backfield. Good job there of getting separation from Jalen Johnson. Jalen Johnson thought he was going out to the flat, but an angle route brought him back underneath. Six catches with Thielen tonight. Young. That shoulder shake. This time nothing happening. Sack at the 34-yard line. Rasheem Green with the sack. So they came in with ten sacks in the entire season and have three tonight. Yeah, and I think a lot of it has to do with you can't give Montez Sweat the credit here. That's good hands that time by Green and his eyes in the backfield. So when Young starts to escape, he collapses back down and comes up with that sack. Checking down 14. Three minutes. Everything to be checked down underneath, not just on third down. That's why they cannot get the ball downfield. There's just no open receivers to take those shots. At that point in the game, you're almost, I don't want to say compelled, but it's fourth and six. They've been punting all night in situations similar. Trying to create a field goal, but this time they have to go for it. At least line up for it, and they are going to go for it on fourth down. Young escapes. Young throws. Young with a flag thrown. That is caught that time by Tommy Trimble. It was a fourth and six, and we'll see about the flag. Big conference here. Crowd waiting with bated breath. There are two fouls against the defense on the play. Holding number 29. Holding number 33. Both those punings are declined. The yardage game is enough for a first down. Either corner, take your pick, Johnson and Stevenson. So what was a first and 30 now is a first down, and the drive continues. Watch Tremble work outside, give himself some room to work back to the inside. But look, this is what Bryce Young can do. On the move, fourth down, doesn't hurry, doesn't panic, is able to look and navigate that defense and finds in the backside an open tight end. It's known for more of his physicality and blocking, but makes a great catch. Give it to Blackshear. picks up three and Dockway with the tackle. Second down and seven for Carolina. Overcame those penalties. They were at first and ten at the plus 40. They went all the way back to their own 40 facing first and 30. And they're able to come up with a first down. And the way this offense has looked tonight, I'll go back to what Frank Reich told us. Keep it close to the fourth quarter. Don't feel like you've got to score 50 like you did at Alabama. make two or three special plays in the fourth quarter to win the game. So six of the last seven drives with punch. Ending with punch. The other one with a field goal. Second down and seven. Pressure from the outside from behind. Gets it away. Caught as a 23-yard line or 21-yard line by Miles Sanders. So T.J. Edwards makes the stop there. Only a short game. third down and six. Eberflus' defense done a great job on third downs. Carolina's had ten. They've converted just two of them. See how the offensive line holds up and if the Bears bring any pressure this time. Spotted with a 20. It'll be third down and five. Seventh play of the drive. Young in the pocket under pressure throws incomplete coverage is right there continue for Paris Marshall Tyler Gordon makes the stop fourth down in comes the field goal group you gotta make this catch Bryce Young he's getting pushed from the middle he's able to get that ball around the pressure that is a great throw it would have been short but they would have had a chance there at fourth and one if he holds on to that football instead of 39-yard field goal attempt for Eddie Pinheiro. Made one tonight from 33. This one is right down the middle, and it's a three-point game with 11.06 to play in the fourth. Chicago, 16. The U.S. and Deontay Foreman has been running the football all year when he's had his chances and really has taken over for Herbert. It's about physicality. 73 tonight, 55 yards after contact. And look at this, 266 after contact. Since week six, he is second in the entire league. And he got that big touchdown for the Bears by showing what he can do after contact as well. 73 yards for him. That's why he's averaging four yards per carry. Chicago is going to get the ball there. Up by three. 11.06 left in the fourth. start from the 25. A little Thursday night football talk. Ravens four straight wins. They might make it five this weekend, and we have them next week. It's Cincinnati at Baltimore on Thursday night. Best point difference in the league. Eagles, of course, first team to start 8-1 or better in consecutive seasons since the 0-5-0-6 Colts. G.J. Stroud, who really lit it up or lighted it up last week. Five touchdowns. Take your pick in terms of reverberating one of you. 30 out of 42. 470. A draw. So Carolina's defense, with the help of that call, they get off the field. And now they are going to give their own offense a pretty good field position here. Trenton Gill. His punt is a high punt. Might have been tipped. They're going to let it bounce. Takes a sideways bounce. And that's going to set Carolina up in pretty good shape as the crowd continues its frustration about the offensive pass. They're going to have to be a 26-yard punt back in 30 seconds. See how the ball turned on him? It did. As he was just about to hit it, And that's what I think created that shank. But Carolina at the plus 40, see if they can do anything with it. Yeah, Chicago had that short field and made it pay off with the touchdown drive. See what the Panthers can do here. Young, flushed out again. Flag is thrown behind him. Taking down at the line of scrimmage. And the penalties against Carolina. Holding offense. Number 76. 10-yard penalty. We play first down. Calvin Throckmorton. They get first and 20. One-on-one matchup there, and he just gets overpowered. We've been seeing that a lot tonight. That's a rookie pickings out of South Carolina just pushes him. Throckmorton right into the backfield, and if it's not a holding call, you're dealing with the quarterback having to deal with a big lineman, his own lineman in his face. On first and 20. A toss here to Hubbard. He got another flag coming in here. Was a six-yard gain. Pass interference. Offense number 11. And that's on Smith. Maricetta ran the punt back with a touchdown. in the game now as a receiver. So it's going to be first down and 30. This defense is holding steady. They did this last week, and there's an obvious pass interference there on Carolina. Look how far back we are now in first two plays. You're looking at first and 30. So much for great field position and a short field at the plus 40. Now they're at their own 40. Final seconds of the quarter. Last play of the quarter here. Hubbard gets a couple. Fourth quarter will start with a second down and 27. End of three. Any one in that quadrant. Second and 27. And we start the fourth. Young checks it down to the outside. and working his way into Chicago territory goes Shuba Hubbard. But it was first and 30, so right now it's third down and 17. Here's our next-gen stats powered by AWS. You can see, like any quarterback, no pressure. He's going to do a lot better. He hasn't had a big night throwing the football. But under pressure, you see it's been tough. Sacked a few times. He's been able to avoid some sacks, but just completing 33% and only 13 yards. Feels like he's been under pressure a lot more than just being three of nine. Coming across the line, they're going to shut this play down because Walker got too much of a head start. So chipping away now, it's going to be third down and 12, assuming it's an offside, which it is. defense in the 95 five-yard penalty remain clear down Chicago 18 first pass Carolina only eight young 12 or 24 for 114 and 45 of those yards came on that one pass to Strong. Third and 12. Young hanging in. Look out. Gets hit at the end. Finally checks it off to Hubbard. Back to the 36. He goes. So it's fourth down and six. He got popped that time by Justin Jones. Iber Flues is as a head coach and he calls the defense. He continues to sit back in zone, whether it's two high or covered three, just sitting back, forcing every... Field goal attempt for Eddie Pinheiro. Pinheiro's kick is no good. Started out with a draw, looked like it'd make it through. No. Well, all right, let's look at this. You saw the probability was like 1-5. I know it's 4th and 10. What do you do there? What would you have done? Well, I think I'd go back to that third down play because even if you don't get the first down, you'd love to get five yards, right? You'd love to get six yards, and you come up short, you got at least a better chance at the field goal. It was a good call. Bryce Young just, and he saw a point to himself. I misread that. That's me. That's on me. He'll take it. But, yeah, you take a shot there, and, you know, I just, I don't know that he's got the distance to be able to make that kick from 59. And he did not. So from the 49 out, you know, they used that timeout, which obviously is him growing. He has to go through this. It's not easy. But until Carolina is able to get better pieces around him at receiver and offensive lineman, you're swimming upstream. That's just the reality of where they are. If people want to blame Bryce Young, you're the first pick overall in the draft. He's going to have to take it. But it's not real to me. What's real is they've got to get better. And, you know, I think they recognize that. Nobody knows it better than Frank Wright. Well, they're a little hamstrung now. David Tepper is the owner of the team. And, of course, he's as frustrated as anybody under the circumstances. But he's on the team for five years. and he's a guy who, you know, he's at all causes trying to win. Yeah, yeah, he is. You go to the other side of this with the Bears, and it came so close to winning last week despite being minus five and a turnover margin against the Saints. This is a better team than their record. There are pieces on this team that you can see now that they're healthy. I'm excited to watch where they go in this second half. We'll see if Justin Fields is able to get his thumb healthy and bring him back. But they've got enough pieces on defense to be a threat in a lot of the games they play. Third and seven, and that's going to cement it. He is Mooney, makes the catch, picks up the first down. Carolina out of timeouts. And there is Daddy Bajent. We talked about the arm wrestling king, his baby boy. he's going to pull off a win here. And Iberflues goes to 2-9 now in those one-score games. So good for the Bears getting this win. They needed it. Bears next three all against the NFC North. At the Lions, at the Vikings, and then the Lions again after a bye. We got a flag here. So, Justin Fields, in all likelihood, will be ready to go in 10 days at Detroit. The second year, Dan Campbell, when it started to turn in Detroit, I think he was like 1-19-1. People were saying the same things, but they had some pieces that they felt good that they could build around. And obviously, they got it going in a much different direction, where now you see who they are. But you've got to start somewhere. You know, it's a process to learn how to win games like this. It doesn't just happen overnight. And it's not fun to go through, but the teams that figure it out eventually can become a winner. False start on the offensive of 21. It's a five-yard penalty. We play first down. In this situation, the defense declines the 10-second runoff. That's Foreman. But the only thing he's done wrong tonight, 21 carries 80 yards. Caught two more for 12. Had 83 yards last week in New Orleans. And this will take us, well, a couple of seconds from the end of the game. I don't think they're going to even make him snap it. And they won't. And you got the Bears who figured to win the game by about three, and that's exactly what they did. If you know what I'm doing. I know you know what I'm doing. I sure do. And I always marvel at it. And we get outside after the game. I'm like, how does that happen? It just fluctuates a little bit. So I say about three. Yeah. Depending on who you talk to. Look at the Chicago lessons left. Over the middle. Caught. Near the 40-yard line, Tommy Tremble. Tight end. Picks up about five. Third and nine. With Carolina behind the sticks, you see Iberflue's continuing to sit back that time with two high safeties, willing to give away those underneath throws. And then just, again, you've got to get to the football and you've got to bring down that intended target. Somebody from Carolina, if they're going to come back and have a chance to tie this or take the lead, somebody's got to make a play, more than likely off of a scramble, by being able to get separation. We have two downs here, you would think, in this situation, no matter what happens. Third down and nine. Clock ticking down to 215. Young throws, caught. It's going to be fourth down, fourth, and about a yard, a yard and a half. Hayden Hurst is there. That should take us to the two-minute warning. Obviously, they'll go for it. Sanborn makes the tackle. and we have reached the two-minute break. Two minutes to go. In a three-point game, can they keep the drive alive? They go five wide on a fourth and two. Rush four. Caught. Keep the drive alive. Another fourth down conversion. This time it is Miles Sanders and Carolina tonight. Three for three on fourth down. Now, you're going to love this route right here. Look, he's off the line of scrimmage, in and back out, and he's up against T.J. Edwards in man-to-man coverage. Great recognition by Bryce Young to find that matchup and to go to his running back who's lined up, Miles Sanders, who's got wide receiver skills to be able to make that play out in space. Panthers, all three timeouts available. him. Under pressure. Throw is low. Had to get rid of it in a hurry. Under pressure. That's on Hayden Hurst, the intended receiver. Tyler Gordon did the blitzing. Second down and ten. They brought pressure off to his right. He had a wide open Hayden Hurst and just couldn't quite get enough on that football to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. Got hit right as he threw the ball by Justin Jones. Can the Bears finish? Matt Eberflus one and nine in these one score games. Thirteenth play of this drive. Which has consumed almost five and a half minutes. Blitzing again from the outside. Pass is incomplete. Intended that time for Mingo. Covered by Connor Gordon just all over the place. Blitzes on the last play. Covering deep on this play. Third and ten. I'm not saying that Bryce Young is going to come through, but I will tell you in calling a bunch of his games on big stages and national championships and those kind of games, his greatest strength is the bigger the stage and the bigger the moment, the calmer he would be. So I can't tell you how many times I would see him in these kind of moments late in a game, keep his poise and make good decisions and find the open receiver and make an accurate throw. Carolina's going to take a timeout just to get resettled here. They're clearly in a situation third down, but they have two plays to pick up the first down. Drive starting way back at their own nine-yard line. Instead of running up the middle there, they pulled him out to the outside. Third down now, they're able to convert there. Worth and two right here. Keeps it going. So in a situation again, obviously you've got two plays here to pick up that first down. On this drive, 48 of the 50 yards passing. Will we have a tie game? Do you have a possible field goal attempt coming up? We'll find out. 16-13, 144 to go. Third and ten. Pressure again And almost intercepted And juggled and incomplete Sanborn was there Had an opportunity Ball was deflected Hanging in the air for another Instant or so It'll be fourth down, fourth and ten He's in for Edmonds They've been mugging him and dropping him the entire game Here he shows blitz And then drops completely fools Bryce Young, who thought he was blitzing. Great call by Eberflus. Great execution by Sanborn. It just misses him. Meanwhile, instead of going for it on fourth down and long, it's going to be a 59-yard rookie record. This is a five-yard game. Of course, when it comes to talking about C.J. Stroud, you know what we're talking about. Obviously, Carolina could have picked him, but it's early. And I think that's why things have gotten as loud as they have gotten for Bryce Young. He throws a couple pick sixes last week and a loss against Indy. And what is, look what C.J. Stroud's doing. He's having a huge year and threw him 470 yards. Of course, he did beat him when they met head-to-head. But it's easy to look at it through a vacuum lens. There's a throw in. Open. There's Komet. And the big man takes it all the way out to the 43-yard line first down. Again, this is where he is most comfortable, where they're able to run the ball with Foreman and then have this not just play action. Again, I love how he sells it. Then he's able to work around. And at that point, he's already able to. D.J. Johnson has no chance to stay with Komet. Komet is so good at selling it himself on the edge and then out into the flat. Timing is perfect and a great complement to this running game. Targeted six times tonight. Caught five. Beijing now 18 of 30 for 156. And taking it to the 49-yard line goes Roshon Johnson, the rookie out of Texas, picked in the fourth round. There's different ways to be effective as an offense. Everybody, I think, gets enamored with what Miami does, and they should, and what Philly does, and what any of these teams, Kansas City does. But this is a team right now in the Bears that has to win, playing complementary football, defense and special teams, and a quarterback taking care of the ball. That's been a disaster for the Bears this year. And on the ground this time, it's Johnson again. Forward progress should net him the first. Going to spot it at the 45-yard line. Checking the sticks. Getzy calling in the play. He first down. They give it to him. I guess he has to be extremely appreciative of what he's saying tonight. And when they've lost six games, they're minus 14 in a turnover margin. When they've won, had two wins, they've been plus five. They're dead last in the entire league in turnover margin. And tonight, doing a much better job with Bajan. If he's doing anything great, it's taking care of the ball. Deep drop from the pocket. That was tipped and seemed complete. He got it away, second down to 10. Last week they were minus five. Five turnovers to none for New Orleans. Amazingly the only loss by seven. Every week it seems like we're talking about special interior defensive linemen. Derek Brown is obviously a big part of that. He's usually a nose, and now he's that 4-I, that defensive end in this 3-4. Just overpowers Jenkins again. And 76 is a powerful man, better in the run than he is in pass pro. And every time he drops back in pass pro, 95 is throwing him. This time moving the pile. Foreman turns a no gain or a one-yard gain into a four-yard gain. You know, in that first and ten, we've been seeing so much play action. This time they went straight drop back, and I just held my breath after I just said, Bajan has to turn the ball over. He's playing smart. I'm thinking, oh, no. He's going to throw a pick, and he almost did. Justin Fields is thinking what you were thinking. Saw him on the sideline. Third down and six. Pressure. Has to get it away. Caught. but stopped in his tracks. Deion Jones makes the tackle on Johnson. So now you're at the 45-yard line. He got a fourth down and nine. Now watch this read by Deion Jones. Sees the lineman go out and then beats him out to the point to be able to make that play. Just really good instincts and feel there on that third down call, knowing they weren't going to put Bajit in a position to turn it over. easy throw and it did not fool Deion Jones at all. Yeah Jones been around six years in Atlanta last year in Cleveland. First year in Carolina. Yeah Montez Sweat who came over just a few weeks ago is really acclimating himself well to Matt Uberflues' system. Such a force not only against the pass he does a good job against the run and I think he opens up other opportunities for these other defensive linemen. He's one of the best edge players top.
