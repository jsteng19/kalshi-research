 Pressure is coming and I can see his eyes kind of start to look up. Affected him getting able to secure the football, so just had to eat it. Great call, exactly. Here's Bailey's kick. It's a good one. Pulled into the 23-yard line, Codrington. And he'll bring that back to the 37-yard line with .224. After a 56-yard original franchise back in 1960, played at old Royal Memorial Stadium. Start this drive. Hand off here. Another big hole and another nice run for James Cook. Fourth year out of Georgia. Picks up a total here of nine yards, second and one. That's old school football. Getting a hat on a hat on a counter play. Good job with Gilliam. The fullback that gets overlooked because we talk so much about the three tight ends. But when you have these many pieces at your disposal as an offensive coordinator, You've got a quarterback that can handle it, whether you go heavy or you spread them out, you do anything in between. Puts so much on a defense to deal with, especially when you've got a short week to try to prep. Ty Johnson in and running back. And this time, on an end around, Elijah Moore picks up the first down and a few more as he gets taken down at the bench. That's a gain there of 11 yards with a minute and a half to go in the quarter. Jet sweep here to get him out on the edge from left to right. Watch the two tight ends on our right. Watch how quickly they're able to get outside, outflank this defense. And, again, you look at the totality of this offense and how they attack. It's stretching you outside with plays like this. It's the interior run with James Cook. And then it's the play-action pass game. And all the different looks with emotions and the different personnel groupings. Cook back in. Take the hand. Fired over the middle into a lot of traffic. but he guns it in there perfectly to Kincaid for a first down. And now that's what we're saying. You just dealt with a jet sweep. You're a linebacker. Your eyes are in this backfield, and you're worried about, are they running the football with James Cook? If they are, I've got to get downhill and make a play. Nope, they're not. Great. Now it's play action. They're going to go behind me. So right now the Bills just one step ahead of this Miami Dolphins defense. Final minute of the quarter. First down from the 31-yard line. Palmer moving. A little toss back here to Ty Johnson. And the X-Jet and Lion. Picks up about four. Second down and six. Tackle there by Ashton Davis. Could be the final play of the quarter. I think the tough thing for Miami is Anthony Weaver just wants to see this defense play as 11. You know, if you look at the tape these first two weeks, They look like a team that has not played inspired football. Tonight, that's what they're trying to do. Play with some effort. Play together. Can they get off a play in the waning seconds? No, they cannot. That's the end of the quarter. Played 15 minutes at high mark. 7-7 on Thursday night. We come back. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hart time. 7-7, second down and six for Buffalo starting the second quarter. And this time, Cook keeps those legs driving. He turns a one-yard gain into about a three-yard gain. Yeah, he is a tough runner. We've talked a lot about over the years, Josh Allen, how he's changed his throwing mechanics from his rookie year. You can see the shoulder where he's really more all-armed to now working with Chris Hess, and he's an expert in biomechanics, and now it's more about creating force and power from the ground up, sequencing with the hips, and really the hand and the arm is just kind of a GPS. That's why his consistency with his accuracy is so much better over these last three or four years. It changed for him in 2020. That was the game changer, and he points to Chris Hess for helping him do that. Third and two. Here's Cook. Picks up the first. It's almost similar to a golf swing in so many ways. And Allen has taken up golf and loves it, and he's pretty good. Yeah, I know he is. In fact, when we talked with him this week, we were talking to him a lot about his mechanics, and he is addicted to it. And he is, as you mentioned, a big golfer. I know you and him are often trying to play together in the summer, and he talked about, you know, it's exactly anything that's rotational, whether you're swinging a bat, a pitcher, a quarterback, a golfer, everybody is now, that's the trend over these last four or five years. He's looking for a much better game than I did, trust me. Yeah, you bring the fun to the party. That's about all. From the 18-yard line. Allen to the end zone and drop. And that time it's Kincaid who couldn't hold on. Covered by Ashton Davis. Almost had his fullback. Play clock at two. Johnson. He gets to the 20. So not only do they have the three tight ends, they have a fullback on top of it. Well, Joe Brady, the offensive coordinator, he mixes up a lot of looks. You know, I really feel that he has a chance. You know how Ben Johnson became that offensive coordinator in the NFL. I think if the Bills stay healthy and Josh Allen has another MVP type of season, a lot of people are going to start to look at Joe Brady. Some guys have that look and feel and sound of a head coach. Joe Brady is that kind of guy. So he's going to do everything he can tonight to mix up the looks. Yeah. An empty look. Yeah. They went from tight to five receivers in this pattern. Allen throws to the sideline. Open. Reaching for it. Making the grab. And into the end zone. Dalton Kincaid for the touchdown. Well, that didn't take long. 85 yards, seven plays. And now watch how he brings Kincaid back. Kincaid route, he thinks he's got to keep going upfield. Instead, the ball brings him back. Actually, right there, he just well out in front of him to be able to make the catch, sure-handed. They missed him last year with that knee injury. Looks like he's back feeling much, much better to go along with Knox and Halls with those three tight ends. Matt Prater picked the game-winning field goal against Florida. Opening night picked him up. At 41 years old, he boots it through for the extra point, and we are tied. 7-7. Have a cameo, or even more, in that one. So each team scoring on its first drive. Malik Washington passed the 30 stopped at the 33 what an amazing job here in the opening drive by the Miami Dolphins they came out and really leaned on that offensive line which we had some questions about but it was a good mix some quick throws and able to run the football 30 to return illegal block in the back number 3 of the receiving team 10 yards only if he's fouled a foul. First down Miami. This is what we were talking about. You know, we came in. It's a short week. How's Tua going to handle this? And more importantly, how's the offensive line? Look at the amount of time that he has there. We're able to check that down to HN, and he's able to have an escort out in front. Good job up front. Look at them sustaining blocks. We've not seen this in these first two weeks. In fact, they've had slow starts against the Colts and the Patriots. 15 yards against the Colts, 18 against the Patriots. In the first drive, they had 52 yards and a touchdown. So let's see if they can follow that great drive up here. Backed up, obviously, after that penalty. Tua in the pistol. Quick throw. Incomplete goes to Washington's leg again. Using him quite a lot at the outset tonight. Last week as well, second-year guy out of Virginia. Expect the Bills to kind of mix some things up. They were unable to pressure and affect Tua and get him off of his rhythm. He had plenty of time back there. Their hope tonight was to be able to play coverage and make Tua hold the ball and allow their edge pressure of Russo and Bosa to be able to get home when he drops back to throw. And clog up the middle, make him throw to the outside. Running into traffic, moving ahead for five is Achan. in his third year at a Texas A&M. Third down and five now for the Dolphins. Taman's going to come down to the protection for Tua. Are the Bills going to bring pressure? Are they going to rely on their edge to get there? See how the Dolphins on this big third down here, they can give Tua enough time because I think they have confidence that their receivers can win. he looks across that line he sees joey boson is off to a great start this year now the bills pack the line third and five but rush four two has trouble holding on to it and can only pick up a couple cam lewis stops in there and it's fourth down they walked everybody up we talked about it they're gonna blitz they're gonna sit back they showed it, and I think it may have affected two in his eyes. He's starting to peek and maybe starting to look at Bernard. Are they going to come? Are they dropping? Remember, that's a shotgun snap. He's looking at the ball, also trying to get a feel of whether or not they're going to be the TD of the night. That's the matchups. We keep talking about these tight ends. They want to get the tight ends matched up against a safety where he's got a big advantage with the size. Kincane really has wide receiver skills. Pretty good job at Davis here. Not giving up on the play. Look at the accuracy. But Davis got that left hand in there at the end to be able to knock that football away. Really good effort there by the safety. Save the score. Second down and 10 now. That's Allen's first in completion. He's 4 out of 5 for 46 yards. Gets it away quickly. Caught. Fighting to the 10. Looking for the first down. Comes up a little short. Khalil Shakir. Top receiver last year. And sets up a third down and 2. They say everybody eats. That's been the motto of this offense since Steph Diggs moved on. They really don't have that superstar at receiver. They work as a group. They're not working to get one guy the ball. They let the offense and the defense dictate who's going to be open, and they find the open man, and that's who he's going to throw the ball to. Similar to what we saw with the Packers last week. Who's number one? Who knows? That eight or nine guys are going to catch it. Quick pass here. Caught. That's a first down. That's Keon Coleman who may wind up as, you know, in effect the number one before the season is done. This is what they want to see from him. We saw this in the fourth quarter against Baltimore. Look at the strength there. That's what you want to see. I mean, he's a big body at 6'4", 215 pounds, a quick throw just to get it out there with soft corner coverage and a great job of being able to use the hands and the strength to be able to secure that football to give him this first and goal. Go, go, go, go, go. 10th play of the stride. First and goal. And Allen doesn't like what he sees on the other side, at least for the moment, and will take a tie-out. You know, some teams are good, and they're not particularly interesting. The Buffalo Pills have really become a great team to watch. They are. I mean, I think you bring up Green Bay. It does kind of remind you as far as the way they use different pieces. You don't have that one guy. You kind of spread it out. Boy, what a challenge to get ready for this offense and all the different ways that they can attack you, all the different looks that they give you. And you've got a Miami defense that had a short week. They've struggled in their first two games, and now they've got to go against Josh Allen, where if they get a stop tonight against this offense, it's a good job. Just trying to get a stop to slow down this offense. Absolutely. Totally. I mean, Alan, you know, that's entertainment. You watch the Buffalo Bills. Yeah. They're a draw. And, of course, everybody here, they're just thinking about one thing. Can we get to February? First and goal. It's Alex Anderson. When they go that jumbo left, they're going heavy to the left here. Off the fake. Rolling. He can run if he has to. and said he flips it for the touchdown. He hits Jackson Hawes. Their number three tight end. Rolling against the grain. Could he run? Saw that it was better off to try to flip it, which he does for the touchdown. He gets outside there, and you know what this guy can do with his feet and take it off and run. There's Hawes, by the way, in motion. He'll go back and work his way back the other way. 17 gets out there on the edge. You better look out. You better get ready. And then he just does Brett Favre. A little flick there and a nice little touchdown pass there. The awareness and the understanding of coverage. He baited that defense to be able to get that flick there for the touchdown. Who is Jackson Hawes with pro football focus? Run by my good buddy, Mr. Collinsworth. Has him ranked as the number one tight end through two weeks. Checking Allstate first was really smart. Not checking the Jumbotron. Not smart. completely Miami to receive right now Matt Prater Tyler Bass got hurt Pick up to be run back from the five-yard line by ostrich Well after that to Kaylee report in the booth right now Ohio State Ding Dong School Arizona State and beyond We were talking to McDaniel the other day Who's kind of quirky and idiosyncratic And we know that So he was talking about, or I asked him about his Playing career at Yale What was the highlight? He said on the sideline Interrupting That was his highlight Perfect Could not have scripted They're already moving back After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary roughness, number 85. Wow. Watch this. Tell me will be forced half the distance to the goal. First down, Buffalo. Yeah, Jackson Hawes. Yeah, Hawes. He could have gone 85 and then 57 there at the end as well. But that's, you know, unlike what Miami did with the big return, Josh Allen will start at his own 15-yard line. to Sean McDermott his pedigree is defense offensive coordinator is Joe Brady he calls the plays here we go with the Bills first play from scrimmage, a little pump fake and then a pass down the sideline incomplete, almost one handed by Coleman but there's a flag on this play, Jack Jones with the coverage and the Bills are moving up ahead Well, this is a big part of tonight's game, the cornerback position of the Dolphins. Number 23, the defense. The ball will be placed. Final foul. Automatic first foul. You've got four corners out tonight for Miami. So Jack Jones, who signed with the Dolphins in late July, is starting on one side. and Rasul Douglas, the former Bill, just signed a few weeks ago, late August, on the other side at corner. 20-yard penalty, first down at the 35-yard line. Allen hangs in. Pass is caught up at the 38 and tackled at the 40-yard line. That time is James Cook coming out of the backfield. Already established as one of the best running backs in the NFL. Had a great Sunday down at MetLife against the Jets. Yeah, 21 for 132 yards and a couple scores. I really think he's one of the most overshadowed superstars in the NFL, and I think it's because of Josh Allen. You know, he does such a good job in so many different areas for this offense. Second and five. They go with three tight ends. It's a formation they've been using very often of late. Here's Cook. Breaks it into Dauphin territory. finally taken down at the 44-yard line. Gets through the line of scrimmage. He's off to the races again. Gain a 16. Now, you just talked about the three tight ends. Here's two of them on the left. What I love about this Bills offense is the backside. They finish blocks because they know the vision and the patience of James Cook. The ball is liable to bounce anywhere. He bounces it off and presses and then bounces to the backside, makes one guy miss, and with his speed, you better hold on to your hat because he can take it all the way. come up with three tight again seven minutes to go in the quarter Cook again Cook he can exploit the smallest of holes and takes that one to the 33-yard line so back-to-back good runs for him that one for 11 they get into that 13 personnel it's pretty obvious this year 12 or 13 snaps they run the football they let you know we're going to run the ball and can you stand up to them And this is what we saw last week in their game where they just decided to get physical and run the football against the Jets. Josh Allen didn't have to do much. They got into that 13 personnel and just beat them up up front. They ran for 224 yards last Sunday. Callers number again. This time to the 30-yard line. Short game. We go to Kaylee. You'll see Josh Allen wearing a visor on his helmet tonight. It's for protection after he got popped in the face on Sunday. His nose was bleeding profusely even though he only missed two plays. He practiced with it all this week, and he told us he wore a visor through college, then admitted he just did it for swag back then. And when he got to the league, he said he didn't want to be the rookie trying to look cool. But tonight he needs it. Ward and Laramie at the University of Wyoming. First round pick back in 18. Now Ray Davis is in the backfield spelling Cook. Second down and seven. Palmer comes in motion. To a wing. And the pass is caught. And that's a first down as it's taken down by Golden Kincaid. So they've got those three tight ends. Kincaid, Knox, and Hawes is playing very well this year. Tough. Great job of just showing patience here. They're mixing up their personnel groupings with different looks with the tight ends. Also, you're seeing Josh Allen not trying to force the ball downfield. They've been able to run the ball. Miami's sitting back in coverage and able to check it. Just take what the defense has given him. Throwing that ball underneath for first downs. Now Ty Johnson comes in at running back. And Reggie Gilliam comes in. He worked the right arm around him and knocked that ball away by the veteran White. Second and ten. To him. Trying to get it downfield. Nobody home. Throws it away. Third and ten with one 48 left. They rush four that time, sit back in zone, all the eyes of that back seven on Tua. So the pressure there, able to affect Tua, made him very, very uncomfortable. You could see him, he didn't know if he turned left or turned right, eventually just get rid of the ball. Got to be careful here with 148. Josh Allen, as good as any quarterback in the NFL in two-minute offense. Crowd pumped up for this third down. Tango by Loha over the middle, it's caught Hill spins around, looks for the first down gets it so on a third and ten, Tyreek Hill comes to the rescue two plays on this drive where Tyreek Hill just does things you just don't see very many players be able to make the third down conversion where he helps out finds a soft spot in the zone when his quarterback's running for his life And then here, the yards after the catch, where they had him completely, they had leverage on him. The outside on both sides, and he's able to still stop and go and outrun that defense to get those first down yards. Spinarama, moving the sticks. Ticking down to a minute. Work that clock if you're to it. Gordon in the backfield. They give it to him. Gordon. Picks up about five. Lock still running. Miami has all of its timeouts, as does Buffalo. And the Bills, I think, have decided to use one here. And Buffalo's thinking about trying to get the ball back to Josh Allen. Exactly. Back in 30 seconds. Last two drives, two quick three and outs. This drive, 10 plays, 48 yards, and has consumed over five minutes. And ideally, if you're Miami, you're thinking about points. Make the Bills burn all their timeouts. You want to try to get points with under 20 seconds to go. So Josh Allen doesn't have any time. Buffalo has one timeout remaining. Tua to the outside. A-Chan, nothing happening there. He wants to stay in bounds, and he does, to make the Bills use that last timeout. Third down. there may be some people watching this thinking why is it miami trying to get out of bounds why is it miami the one using their timeouts because they're smart they know who they're going up against tonight in josh allen right and that's why sean mcdermott is thinking hey we want to try to give our guy time and if we can get him off the field here make him kick a field goal we're going to be able to give him maybe 35 40 seconds to work with bills get the ball again to start this second half they deferred exactly you don't want to give me two for one so 47 seconds a running play would they don't get a first down would take him down to the nub take the time out at least get the field let's see what they got in store here Tua stepping up, avoids the sack. He's going to run. He's going to get the first down and slides to a stop at the 18-yard line. Now you've got a first down. Now you want to take your own time out here. But they're letting the clock run. Now they get it. And Al, how about Tua there? Again, not the most comfortable when it comes to getting out of pressure and creating, but he's out here competing. And he realizes when this thing opens up, and he's got everybody covered downfield, they're playing zone, they got eyes on him, he still was able to find enough room there and shows he's got enough speed to be able to get the first down. Good feel, didn't force it, didn't try to force it into one of his receivers like he's done a couple times, especially in Indy week one. And then he slides to avoid that big collision, and they get the timeout after the first down. Great job there. Yeah, big play on several levels. If he gets sacked, I mean, they're still in field goal range, but a lot longer field goal. Now it's a different story. Half a minute. They have two timeouts at the 17. They chain the running back. To a hit from Braze, the opener against the Baltimore Ravens. So Buffalo will kick off They won the toss They have deferred Matt Prater to kick off Malik Washington Had a 74 yard punt return Touchdown against New England Four days ago Ready to receive on a perfect night Temperature In the upper 60s A light breeze And off we go from the goal line Dee Estridge will run it back To the outside But he goes with some room. And the Dolphins get just what they need to start things. A run back all the way to the 50-yard line. Dorian Strong runs him out. So Tonga Bailoa, in his sixth season in the league, takes over after that 54-yard run back. Against the Bills, 1-8. 9 TDs, 10 picks. They have had his number. Now the challenge tonight. He's got four new offensive linemen. The center really the only experienced man up front on the road. They've got to communicate and play together. Of course, his blind side, since he's a lefty, is the right side. They start with play action. Throws that's caught. Reaching up for it, making the grab that time is Washington. Taron Johnson runs him out of bounds. It'll be second down and five after a gain of five. Miami is obviously built with speed. Buffalo wants to do everything in their power as a defensive unit to keep this speed in front of them, not give these fleet-footed receivers and backs a lot of space. They've got to leverage the football and rally. Two years ago when they led the league in offense, they were a track meet, second and five. A run on the inside. Stuffed. H-hand. Stopped at the line of scrimmage and it'll be third down. So the Bills have their own problems in terms of defensive injuries. Ed Oliver and Matt Milano are both out tonight. Two key starters. Yeah, two starters out. Walker, who just made a heck of a play. The rookie out of Kentucky in the middle there. T.J. Sanders, Daquan Jones, and Dorian Williams in for Matt Milano. He led the Bills defense last year in tackles with Milano out, so has a lot of experience. Having a gun on a third down and four. To the outside, and is the catch made? It is right at the marker. Tyreek Hill holds it in, covered by Benford, and that's the first down. What a battle into the boundary here. Benford is a physical corner, wants to get his hands on the receiver. He's going up against the quickest receiver in the NFL. What a pressed look there. Tyree kill with a little slippery move to the inside, works to the outside. And then the fingertip catch and two feet down for the first down. Great look at it right there. Oh, so they get the long run back, pick up a first down on their first possession. A-chan in the backfield. Two of takes. then he goes A-chan and he goes down the sideline for a first down. Julian Hill tight end makes the block there. They kind of flash a screen to the right watch Tua action watch the defense react to it moving Engold a little fake now you get the defense to move to hesitate and that all you want to do Get them to hesitate just a bit and you got the escort screen on the other side there with a tight end Julian Hill out in front From the 21, Ali Gordon now in the backfield with Tua Give it to him over the left side So the Dolphins have been playing from behind Got killed in the opener against Indianapolis We're never in the game And last week had a fight from behind They were down 12-0 early against New England Yeah, now that's such a great point Because they haven't really been able to run the football I mean, this is a team that really prides itself on Running that outside zone Running the football To set up the rhythmic play-action In-breaking play-action pass game And just haven't been able to do that tonight off to a great start here on this opening drive. Gordon, a rookie out of Oklahoma State, stays in and running back. Second and seven. Play fake. Pass is caught. Looking for some room. Washington gets inside the 10. And another first down, but a flag is down. First of the game, Allen Eck is the referee tonight. And Miami coming back. Ineligible player downfield. Number 71 offense. Five-yard penalty. Replay. Second down. We're talking about the right side of the line. That's Keyon Smith. That's part of this offensive line up to this point. They've been having pretty good symmetry playing together. It's been a great plan of Mike McDaniel and his staff's put together. Get a look at him right here. He just gets downfield. Yeah, he's about four or five yards downfield. So it's the first setback here on this opening drive. Would have been a first and goal. Instead, it's a second and 12. To the outside, A-Chan with some room. And he's close to a first down. It's a second and 12. They're going to spot it about a yard shy, third and one upcoming. Obviously, this Miami offense, it's not just Tyree Kill and Jalen Waddell. A-Chan, as he shows you right there, is 5'9", about 191 pounds. But he brings speed and also just a great instinctive back. That time there was penetration. He was able to feel it and then bounce to the outside and able to accelerate upfield. Give him a shot here on third and short. Gordon is the running back. Seventh play of the opening drive. The rookie takes it. And Gordon to the four-yard line. First down and goal for Miami. Tell you what, we came into this game wondering how this offensive line on a short week in a hostile environment with really four new starters up front would respond. Look at the movement on third and short. Just pushing people around and with not having Ed Oliver in the interior, they're able to control the line of scrimmage and get the big fella of the football there. Got some positive yards. Gordon staying in on a first and goal. Takes it again but slips before he gets to the line of scrimmage. Second down and goal, five minutes into the game. Dolphins are looking like a team that's sick about reading how bad they are. That's what we said in the open. You know, forget about the X's and O's. Just show up with a chip on your shoulder and come out swinging. See where things stand at the end of 60 minutes. Mike McDaniel has his team with the right mindset. He did tell us two things. We've got to win the turnover margin, and when we get in the red area, we cannot kick field goals. We've got to get touchdowns. if we want to beat Josh Allen and the Bills here. Come up in a tight formation. To it, backing, throwing to the outside, trying to fight his way to the goal line is Malik Washington. He's popped that time by Terrell Bernard to save a touchdown at the one-yard line, maybe just short of the one, maybe one-and-a-half third down and goal. He's looking at Tyreek Hill here on the outside, trying to work into the middle, take him away, so he just checks it down. And again, there's some space there. Came pretty close. Good job of filling up there by Taylor Rapp, the safety. Keep him out of the end zone. Third and goal. This is the tenth play of Miami's opening drive. And Ollie Gordon, the rookie, the big back, 225 behind the quarterback. Ball spotted right at the two. Again, Gordon plunging forward. He's in. So the Miami Dolphins, not given very much of a chance in this game, say, hold on, every, for just a second anyway. No doubt about it. Six and a half into the game. You know, I think you and I are thinking and seeing the same thing. This is a team that kind of showed up in a bad mood, and this is what they really haven't had, is a power back. This rookie, Ollie Gordon, they challenged him to lose some weight, get motivated, be a guy that can be their short yardage, and red zone back, and he definitely showed up tonight. A couple times he got his hands on the football. So, Tua does a great job there leading this team. The big kickoff return to kind of set the tone. And they take advantage of it. Put seven points up on the board. A 54-yard run back. Rowdy Patterson boots it through. Gordon in his third game has his first career touchdown. And the Dolphins. State-of-the-art. Fantastic. I can't wait to see what that will be next year. Home of the Bills next year. Meanwhile, running it back. The goal line is Codrington. Brandon Codrington stopped at about the 31-yard line. And here comes Allen for the first time tonight. Great night on opening night. Won his last 11 home starts. 67 touchdown runs. Second most all-time to Cam Newton. And, of course, won the MVP last year. While you were looking at Josh Allen coming back, there was a penalty after the whistle. I think it's going to be on the Bills. Retaliating. And the reason I bring up under center is I think that's another piece to what he likes to do. Because you get James Cook back there basically dotting an eye, running downhill. And then they work so well, play action, kind of marrying that look with play action with Josh Allen. We're good, we're good, we're good. I need you. All right, Danny, what's up? Off the fake. Pass is caught on the outside. That's a first down and a lot more. Tyrell Shavers makes his first catch of the night. Brady's got to have so much fun with all these toys to work with, the tight ends and three running backs. Of course, Josh Allen. Yeah, and he sees it before it happens. They use motion as an indicator. So they already know. He already knows that Shavers is going to be freed out out in the flat. So that's why he doesn't even finish his drop. He's already trying to get the ball out there to be able to get the ball to Shavers because he knows he's going to outflank this defense. They motioned. They saw the response and how the defense with the rookie Marshall goes with him. And it's like a little bit of a screamer, a little bit of a pick to be able to get him out in space out there to the flat. But, again, just the awareness, the vision, the eight years of experience. He knew before he got the ball in his hands from the snap where he was going to go and did it quickly. And they're working on Jason Marshall, so we've got a timeout here. He's out Trying to find anybody to play corner right now This is a new secondary If you go back to where they were a year ago Even if they had Everybody in the lineup They'd still be breaking in a new group Allen to the outside Cook makes that catch Taken down there by Ashton Davis after a short game Gain at 2, second and 8 and we get another Dolphin player down. Believe it or not, it's another corner. Jack Jones. So Jones, who they picked up from Vegas after last season, here's what happened. Hmm. Unfriendly fire. Yeah, Kincaid there on a crosser, like a mesh route. Left shoulder got him right in the chest. That means Ethan Bonner is going to come into the game. Second-year guy, free agent out of Stanford. And he's been dealing with a hammy himself. Yeah, first time he's been active this season tonight in game three. and you're going against Josh Allen with all these weapons with these corners Cook, well breaks that first tackle got away from Jalen Phillips and as he crossed the line we're halfway through the quarter it's going to be third down and eight as Marshall goes back to the locker room the strength of this defense is the edge of Phillips. It's great to see him back and healthy after what he dealt with in 23 with the Achilles and 24 last year with the knee. And on the other side, Bradley Chubb, who's dealt with some injuries. When they're healthy, they've got a win on the outside for this defense, especially right here. A little decent news is Jack Jones was out for only one play. Allen in the pocket. Allen under pressure. Allen's going to go down to the 25-yard line. Bradley Chubb is there. On cue, we just talked about if they're going to be able to slow down Josh Allen, you've got to be able to win here and here. And the fact that they're getting healthier, these guys as a tandem when they rush them both, it's one thing you slide one way. Here you've got Dawkins on an island and Brown on the other side, two very talented tackles, but Chubb able to get home. Yeah, Chubb now has a sack in every game. That's three for the season. Prater now, a 39-yard field goal attempt. And that kick is no good. So the big hero on opening night misses this one. Miami holds. 14-7 is the score. We're back in 30 seconds. How about Taylor Rooks and Richard Sherman? and look like pros, don't they? Yeah. Meanwhile, Prado was anything but a pro on this one. Misses like 10 miles. And the hold, and you know, you and I have never golfed together. I told you I'm terrible. I'd make you feel good about your games. You need to play with me to make you get your confidence up. But that was just a miss. I mean, the operation was perfect. Snap, hold, he had the big kick against Baltimore. Great career. But he gives the Dolphins life here. Yeah. Exactly what Miami needed. as Tua goes back and nothing happened in downfield. She has to swing it to the outside. Nate Chan will get wrestled down, or stopped anyway, after a gain of about three. And you're just tuning in. The Dolphins took the ball in their opening drive, and, boy, they were in sync. They had a little bit of everything going. They gave Tua some time. They were able to control the line of scrimmage with his offensive line despite the injuries and the inexperience up front. and they just moved the ball after a big kickoff return right down the field and jumped out to a 7-0 lead. And since then, the Bills have adjusted and brought more pressure and the Dolphins have not been able to respond back. H-N, keep it on the ground. Fighting. Comes up about two yards shy of the first. Tackled there by Tredavious White. Good to see him back. Long time build. then an Achilles at surgery. A couple of teams played with the Rams last year for a while. Back here. And his teammates love him. He was part of that core group going back a number of years ago, now in his ninth year in the league. Deion Dawkins, Josh Allen, a lot of the Bills excited to have him back. Big play here for this Dolphins offense. Third down and one. inside to the 43, so back to Ollie Gordon, who was the big guy on that first drive scored the touchdown he picks up the first, clock keeps running 4.5 to the half, that's rookie against rookie there, what a job at 225 pounds, he was met right at the line of scrimmage by Walker, the rookie out of Kentucky and he's able to shake through that arm tackle and pick up just enough for that first down. What a great addition to all the speed that they have all over this offense to bring in a big thumper like that to get those tough yards. 6'2", 225. Got a great preseason. Now through the middle. A-chan. Tua to this point has only thrown nine times the 32 yards. Averaging only three yards per pass. This is an offense we all know about. Mike McDaniel and his time at San Francisco with Kyle Shanahan. They've got to be able to run the football, especially tonight on the road with this offensive line. They do not want to be in a situation where Tua, like the first two weeks, is just constantly throwing. That's why even though they're down seven, you've got to stick to the game plan, stick to your guns, your identity. Run the ball to set up that play action. Fake toss, and then to the outside, look out. HN pays the price. Shaq Thompson, who's been doing that sort of stuff for 11 years in the league, third down. Shaq Thompson, with his experience, he knew that Alec Ingold is the escort. Ingold matched up one-on-one here. It's a foot race. He's got to be able to get out to the outside and then be able to finish the playoff. But it was because he was able to have that peripheral vision on that blocker allowed him to get outside of him and have leverage to finish off that play. Every time Tua looks down the middle, nobody's open. Flushed out again. Down the sideline, and that's caught at the 41-yard line. So Tyreek Hill makes the catch, keeps the drive alive with two and a half to the half. That's a heck of a job, obviously, by the backside by Tyreek Hill, helping out his quarterback. We know about his ability to make plays in space here. He's just trying to say, hey, I'm in your vision. I got this. And then he goes way up to climb the ladder to make that play. And how about Tua against that corner blitz? Broke contain. And then kept his eyes downfield and eventually looked backside and finds Tyreek Hill. Ticking down to the two-minute warning. And we have reached it before the snap. So first and ten, two minutes remaining in the first half with the Bills on top of the Dolphins. 14-7. I missed that, right? I saw the video. It's like you guys had a hell of a time. First and ten. That pass is broken up by White. Tended for A-Chance. He talked about Tredavious White. Now in his ninth season of the year. Lee, last year, went to the Rams, went to Baltimore. Comes back home here. You see A-Chance out there to the outside. That gives you an idea of what kind of skill set he has as a running back to line up as a receiver. They want to move him around. Heck of a job of getting his arm, not quite that left arm, on the back or on the body. He throws, and that at the 10-yard line is incomplete. It bounces into Tanner Conner's hands. Looks at the reference. If he did make the grab, they say no. Bosa put the heat on, second and 10. Initially, he got his arms underneath the football. That ball didn't skip to him. He got his arms under the ball, but it must have gone through and then hit right there. If he keeps his elbows together, that's a catch, but instead it slid right through. Terry, in our picture here, up here in the booth, waving incomplete. He agrees with us and the officials. That ball went right through his arms. This is the 14th play of this drive. On second and ten. A-chan. to about the 10-yard line. Take a timeout here. Dorian Williams makes that tackle. They still have one remaining with 17 ticks. Now, I don't know if they're going to score a touchdown here, but as far as managing this drive, they've converted on a few third downs. They've been able to work the clock down. When you go back to where this drive started and how it's played out, this is about as perfect of a drive as you could hope for if you're Mike McDaniel. Now it's just a matter of what he told us on our Zoom. We get down here, we've got to score touchdowns because they know 17 and Blues on the other side and how tough he is to stop for this Miami defense. On this drive, there's Stephen Ross, the owner of the team, chairman of the board. Miami on this drive, four for four on third down. Third and three. Hill is in the backfield this time. To it, we'll throw it to him. Tyreek Hill! out of bounds with 11 seconds. They can serve that last time out. That's going to make it first and goal. Good call, Al. What a great job there by getting the ball to your playmaker, as you mentioned, out of the backfield. And because he's so sudden, even though the Bills are trying to force him back inside to make them use that last time out, he's able to not only pick up that first down, but with the speed and awareness, able to get out of bounds now to the three-yard line. Five runs, ten passes on this thus far 15-yard drive. And with that timeout, you can still run the ball. To a close, and that's going to be caught for a touchdown by Jalen Waddell. His first catch of the night. And the Dolphins, who were in dire straits not long ago, looking like Buffalo was on their way to a touchdown or maybe a two-possession lead, able to get the stop, the missed field goal, and down the field they go 71 yards. And that missed field goal, I think, gave them some life, but then it was still up to the offense to put a productive drive together here, knowing that they had to put points up on the board and had to convert. They were able to execute. Look at eight seconds left. Could not have been, as we said, any better for Mike McDaniel. What's interesting to me, I mentioned they could still run the ball. I think Tua saw the look that he wanted because look at this matchup right here and look at the cushion. Tredavious White ends up giving Waddle it to line of scrimmage. Kind of sinking in coverage, which is surprising, makes it really easy for Tua just to flip it out there with that soft coverage where Waddle's able to make that play and get down for the touchdown. We've got to go all the way back to the third down where they blitzed the corner. This kept the drive alive where he scrambled, which isn't his game, looked back side and finds Tyreek Hill in the soft spot in the zone. And here's Hill again, yards after the catch. But they had him leveraged, and he outran the defense. So what a drive. It's a team that's 0-2, own fans doubting them, signs over their own stadium about firing the head coach. And in a short week in a tough environment in a divisional matchup, every reason to give up, and instead they fight back to get it to 14-0. To tie the game with eight seconds. Waddell, who was on the injury list this week with a shoulder injury. Ian Hill, the key guys on that drive. The kickoff to the end zone. They're going to run it out. And out past the 25 to the 30 goes Codrington. Clock stops at two seconds. Winning play for movie night. Prime video. Watch family favorites like how to train your drag and the bad guys. to Superman available to rent or buy on Prime Video. Downtown Buffalo. Great night, 66 degrees. That wasn't our hotel back there, was it? No, sir. No, no. We were out in the suburbs. I can spot a hotel miles away, as you all know. Meanwhile, kneel down here. You know, you've been in this situation before. Miami comes in, big underdog, a lot of stuff going on. The coach is on the hot seat. What are you trying to think about as a collective unit at that point? What are you trying to do? You've got to stay together. You can't fracture. And what I liked, when Waddle scored that touchdown last week, there was no celebration. He busted out the Waddle this week, which is important for team morale. Second down, 13. Keep it on the ground. Game of a couple, third and long. A chance stop there. Yeah, it becomes a lot about vibes with these guys. I start watching body language, making sure that the guys are coming in and out of the huddle. We're doing fast transitions with the substitutions. Because as a quarterback, and you saw Tua competitively make some plays there with his legs, everything falls on you and your urgency in this situation. Let's see if he can keep this drive alive. He had four third-down conversions on the touchdown drive. They don't want to give up the touchdown to start the second half, then go three and out quickly. They're facing that possible dilemma here, third and 11. Has time. Going deep downfield and incomplete. Intended there for Tyreek Hill. Coverage was good. Fourth down. We're talking this week with Tua. You see a man, looks like Taylor Rapp, possibly, who made a play on the ball. it's actually the corner Christian Benford but they said you know normal rules don't apply when Tyreek Hill is running a post usually in this situation with a safety in the middle of the field you're not just going to throw it up but you're betting on him to go up and high point the ball and make a play on it there's where Benford went down third down they just put it up in the air into that double coverage look and hoped at 10 got his hands on it they didn't even come down with that catch anyway you've earned your keep here go pay your after dues now Ryan Fitzpatrick not so much doing 87 games it's the fourth down here's the punt a good one fielded at the 17 and dropped there but recovered by Codrington almost a disaster for the Bills he's able to recover that's the break that Miami was looking for. If you're going to come on the road and try to win a game like this, you've got to try to come up with opportunities to take advantage of a mistake. Bonner's right there. Heck of a job of getting that football back there. Very, very close. Codrington able to just get it back. 55-yard punt. Upset with himself. Walking it off on the sideline. Drive starts at the 20. Allen is 15 of 17 for 147. Nice tackle there coming up. Jack Jones making the stop as Cook crossed the line of scrimmage. How about that? Jack Jones known for his ability to cover, but this time on that blitz gets a good job of getting underneath and then showing some toughness there on first and 10. And Dolphins roll the dice. And it pays off. Backside there. Great effort by Jack Jones. Second down. Ten. Ray Davis is now the back. Takes the handoff. Then the pass is caught. But that's covered well as well. Elijah Moore had a big play earlier on. Jack Jones again with the coverage this time. Third down and nine for the Bills. Back-to-back play as the Dolphins. Anthony Weaver, the defensive coordinator, dialing it up, bringing some pressure. That time it's Ashton Davis to safety, but most importantly, able to keep their eyes up and be able to push the receiver out of bounds there after a very short game. This is what you need. This is an opportunity on third nine. Halfway mark of the third quarter. Bills up by seven. Third and nine. Out of a tight formation here. Pass caught. But stopped well shy of the first down. They go to Dalton Kincaid. So Miami creates a three and out. Gets the ball back. They did their job. That's exactly what they needed. They had a nice punt. Able to flip the field. Instead of giving up Josh Allen's first downs and moving the football, they get a three and out to get the ball back to Tua. Let's see what this Dolphins offense can do to respond. Still within a possession here. So Cameron Johnston comes in to punt. It's Buffalo's first punt of the night. Allen steps up. Allen's going to take off. Inside the 30. Slides to a stop just shy of a first down. And a skirmish breaking out. But they have action after the action. They play man coverage here, but they spy with Tyrell Johnson. But he falls for that kind of a ball fake there. We've seen him flip it a couple times. And Kincaid and Rasul Douglas were the early combatants in that skirmish. See Josh Allen there defending his guys, upset there at the end of this play. here's Dotson eventually catches up to him he's giving up on the play and Dotson finishes Kincaid didn't like that at all Dotson and Kincaid now second down and one from the 20 caught first down a lot of room to Rome can he get to the end zone he gets to the one Dotson Kincaid scored their first touchdown of the night gain of 19. Really good job out in front of this play by two of the receivers. Shakir does a good job. You also see Elijah Moore, 10 and 18. How about that arm angle? A little flip there by Josh Allen. And Kincaid with the speed almost takes it to the end zone, but two great blocks out in front there to spring him loose. Minkovich Patrick came back to Buffalo on the deal with Pittsburgh. First down and goal now. Back to Miami after Pittsburgh. Allen. Fakes. Taken down. For a loss of two. And a flag comes in at the end. Again, you've got Spencer Brown, the right tackle that time. Jordan Brooks just... Dolphins make a good play and then they make a middleware. I mean, the play's stopped. He's the leader in the middle of his defense, but he takes it too far. It's the second time on this series. After the play is over. They've hit Josh Allen late. Wow, unnecessary roughness. Number 20 of the defense Passed to the goal Automatic touchdown Whistles have blown The play is over Nothing wrong You always want to see a defense be aggressive but you've got to be smart. You come up with a peck of a stop, and now the whistle plays over, plays over, plays over, and you take him down right in front of the official. Instead of a second and goal, first and goal now, the ball at the two-yard line. Allen under center Cook is the back Cook into the end zone Made it look easy Over right guard, touchdown Buffalo Right side of that offensive line With Spencer Brown at right tackle This rookie Jackson Halls How much fun is he to watch as a reputation, as a great blocker, but as you said, Al, made it look very, very easy on that right side, open it up, and Cook just walks in for the touchdown. Cook, 10 carries, 76 yards. Matt Prater for the extra point. Bangs that one through. So that drive opens up the second half. 4 minutes 37 seconds into it. And Buffalo backs up on top, 21-14. Kelly here, but they love you. Yeah, thank you. They enjoy the dad bods here, I'll tell you that. Without question. Takeoff here, fielded at the three-yard line. Malik Washington gets away from the initial tackle to the 25-yard line. Meanwhile, so we come in here, we think, oh, you're going to get a route, but that was quite a drive by the Dolphins at the end of the first half. It was, and it was the missed field goal before that, too, that was the big deal. I was sitting down there debating with Sherm. They're sitting back and only rushing four the whole time. No blitz, and why aren't you coming after them? He said, that's exactly what's got to happen. They've got to miss a field goal. We've got to get a sack on third down because they're depleted on defense. No doubt. Back in, especially Bradley Chubb. If Miami can hang around, That's definitely a play to remember. From the 29-yard line. To the outside goes this pass, but that's Waddle who gets smothered right away by Tadavious White. Underneath, 25-yard line, Malik Washington. Nice run back here, 12-yard return. And Miami to take over with six and a half to go in the third. And the Bills on top at home by seven. Not thrown for a ton of yards, but look at the air yards for completion. Negative yards. Time to throw over three seconds, which would be the slowest of his entire career. But there's something to think about. Eight of his 13 passes behind the line of scrimmage. So that's why that average is so tight. did take a shot last time out to Tyreek Hill that ended up being an incompletion. 20 attempts, 63 total yards. A little flip back here and a nice run for a game of close to six by H-N. You know, Kirk, you began to wonder with the offensive line issues for Miami. Would McDaniel call a more conservative game tonight? What do you see so far in that regard? I think if you look at the different ways to attack as an offense, they typically use a lot of motions and a lot of different things. I think they have had to streamline it short week on the road. Four new starters up front, still trying to build continuity. So, yeah, I think they have had to simplify it tonight, especially on the road on that short week against this defense. Second down and five. Tool, stepping up. Deep down the sideline, but the receiver falling down. That's Hill. Tyree killed to the ground. And Sloan coming back before third and five. Important thing here against Benford. He wants to get his hands on you to disrupt the timing. He beats him off the line. Little hold there. But then he just loses his footing there. He keeps his feet. Because he won at the line of scrimmage, they had a shot there for first down. Crowd again rising as one, as they often do. When the defense faces a third down. From the 41. And they've got a false start here. And left tackle. Buffalo get a timeout there before the false start. First charge timeout. Buffalo. Oh, they got a timeout before that. So, Tua comes to the sideline here. We can tell you that it's time for the crowning performance. presented by DraftKings Pick 6. The peer-to-peer fantasy product. Tua, 63 passing yards with that one TD. Allen, 153. 17 of 19, only two incompletions for Josh. And just to answer your question a little bit more there, I think Mike McDaniel's calling this game 63 yards. If I said before the game, Al, he's going to have 63 yards through the air, 5.47 to go in the third, you'd think game's over, right? But he's calling the game and managing the game, playing complimentary football because he's within a possession. He's trying to play smart football. Yeah, that was a perfectly managed drive, that 16-play drive, with the usage of the timeouts and the play call. Got him back into the game. Third and five. Konga Mahloin avoids the sack, chased by three Bills, and throws it basically away down the left sideline. So fourth and five. He had exactly what he wanted. He's actually looking at Malik Washington, who is stacked. If you look at Waddle in front, six behind in Washington, and look at the eyes of Tua. Look at the protection. That ball is out right there. That's a first down. Instead, his eyes are there, his feet are not, and he comes off him. Jake Bailey to punt now for the fourth time. Averaging 52 yards per boot. Sky-high kick. Fielded. Fair court at the 16 by Codrington. Five and a half to go in the third. Come on up. Of course you do. Of course we do. Al's got it all up here in the booth. Of course. Caviar, you name it. Quagra. First and ten now. Allen. Takes you up. Think about, you know, with Josh, he comes from a tiny town, Fireball, California, population somewhere between 6,000 and 8,000. It is the cantaloupe capital of whatever. They have a cantaloupe festival every summer. He, of course, has been the grand marshal. Very proud of that. You know, he said, I was thrilled to get drafted by Buffalo. He said, I was going to be much more comfortable in a smaller town than going to New York or Los Angeles or someplace like that. He couldn't have had any better. 185-pound wide receiver for the Bulldogs. Now in his fourth year as the head coach here, Ollie Gordon is the running back as they start this drive through the 26-yard line. To a rolling. Looking, throwing along the sideline, trying to get at the hill incomplete in front of the Dolphins. Bench that time. Chased by Joey Bosa, who after nine years with the Chargers, comes here for his tenth season. They started so well, had such good rhythm with that opening drive. See how Tua and this offense can respond. Remember, Tua himself didn't have a great second drive. Dropped that third down snap. He took his eyes off the football. You're going to have a hard time stopping Josh Allen. Every possession counts for Tua in this Dolphins offense. Two of four out of six for 29. Short drop, quick flip. HN and gets whacked after a gain of one. Terraria's White and Terrell Bernard are both there. The difference in that opening drive and what you've seen here in the last couple is they're cranking up the pressure a little bit more. They're bringing five. They're trying to affect him, not let him have time like he did on that opening drive. Especially when they get him to third down. This is where they like to get creative. third and nine proud and full throat Tua in the pocket flushed eyes downfield throws along the sideline and that is incomplete H.M. the intended receiver Darren Johnson breaks it up fourth down tire focus this week for the Bills is we've got to get two off his spot. He's not as effective on the move. He just doesn't have that X factor like Josh Allen and some of the others. Not his strength. And this time he gives his receiver a shot, but good job of flushing him and good tight coverage downfield. Bailey's second punt. His first was 56. It's almost blocked. Gets it away. Fair catch is goal for him. And made as Codrington goes to the ground at the 28-yard line. 10-44. Left in the first start. this drive. He is 7 of 8 for 64 yards. Off the fake. To the outside goes the pass. And Shakir picks up about 6 before he is slung down on the sideline. So, Kirk, back in the 70s when Miami had the great teams, the undefeated team, won two Super Bowls. They were, for the decade, 20-0 against Buffalo. Wow. Threw a bagel at them. Wow. It's called payback. Yes, I'll say it. It's called payback with Josh Allen. And they're making the adjustments there as a defensive staff. He's talking about trying to pressure and trying to get to the offensive staff. Trying to talk about trying to help Tua and give him some time. I love how they get under center. You don't see a ton of this throughout the league. It's an 11th snap under center already. Second and four. Very boundless offense. There goes Cook. Breaks a tackle. Taken down from behind. Inside the 45-yard line. One a night already. Seven carries for 74 yards for number four. This is giving Miami some of their own medicine. Going to our right, offense's left. This is outside zone play. Good job there by Shavers, the receiver that comes in to block. Great job by Halls, the blocking tight end. Deion Dawkins, the left tackle there, 73. And a great field by James Cook. Just kind of being patient, setting it up, and then accelerating. once he hits that freeze. Now Ray Davis in it running back. Allen has time. He loses that flip again. He's in love with that for the moment. Intended there for Davis. That's incomplete. Carroll Dotson covering on the plate. It'll be second down. Again, that's just a quarterback that feels and sees it. That time he took off, stepped up into the pocket as a threat to run, but with his vision, you just never know. You know, as a defender, you better stay plastered on every single receiver that's downfield. This time it's Davis to back. Because you might get another flip like that. Heck of a play by Dodson to keep that ball away from getting to Davis. I ain't tired. We're good. We're good. We're good. I'm a hot. Quick pass here. Coleman. About a yard shy of the first down. Allen has started 9 of 11 now for 79 yards. Two touchdowns. It's third and one. We've talked this entire first half about Joe Brady and the mixing up the different looks and getting different personnel groupings in. Hand picked a better spot. Second down and six. Cook. And the other thing, too, is he's not the highest paid guy in the league, but it's almost like I think Tom Brady and away in New England, you leave some money on the table so you can take care of the back end of the roster. Yeah, and I think as far as superstars go, what a great teammate. You know, even though he's the MVP of the league, incredibly humble, incredibly receptive. He talked about how, hey, guys, you know, we're in Buffalo. We're hanging out, playing video games together. We're going out to eat together. It really impacts the team and the culture that Sean McDermott is trying to create. It's a great love affair. He with the town, the town with him. Ty Johnson is the back third down and two Dancing, throwing, caught In the middle of a lot of traffic They convert Shavers makes that grab first down Well when they had played zone tonight He is now 12 with 12 For a touchdown And here on the third down and short They sit back, try to keep some eyes on him And drop in fact the defensive lineman There's Seeler But he's still able with all that time Able to just find a hole Shavers does a good job of sitting down at it. There's the first down. Now 18 of 20. On a roll. Has time. Looking, looking, looking, and then throwing it out of bounds. Second down. Well, he is a unicorn. He's 6'5", 237 pounds. He's a little change of the arm angle there. Get it out quickly to King Cade. A little flip there. A la Brett Favre. And then there's the accuracy to be able to get the ball to his tight end. A chance to be able to make the play to get into the end zone. Another ball fake because he flips it on the run so much. Makes the linebackers aware of that and concerned when he takes off that he might do that. So able to use that ball fake like a big power forward on the breakaway. Second and ten. Play clock down to three. gets it away adjusting the pass is incomplete attended for Coleman Douglas with good coverage on the play look at the official I didn't touch him I'm good don't worry and if you're the Bills and you're Joe Brady and Josh Allen this is your guy like Keon Coleman even whether it's getting physical over there or not Keon Coleman's got to become this guy into the boundary that makes that play consistently 6'4", 215 pounds. Ball is thrown. It's coming back to it in position. You've got to use your hands and make that catch, especially the one-possession game. Second-round pick out of Florida State last year. Third and 10. Deep, deep drop. Throws underneath, and that's dropped. Ty Johnson can't handle that. So the Miami defense stiffens again, playing so much better tonight. than in the last two games. You're so right. It's like watching a different team. And we talked in the open about, we don't know what the games, the final score is going to be, but the way they've looked defensively the first couple games, just come out and play as a group and fight. You've been backed into a corner. Let's see what you're made out of. And I'll tell you, considering what they're facing tonight, they've played very well to keep them in this game. And don't forget, they gave up points on the first ten drives they faced this season, And all seven to ending in three last week before they stiffened up. Washington back to the 32-yard line. Kept looking up at the scoreboard and thinking, man, it's a one-possession game. And here we are a week later in Buffalo. And it feels like Buffalo's very much in command of this game. And yet with 2.58 to go into third, here's Miami down seven. from the 33-yard line they begin this drive. Tua under pressure flips it off. Nice move there. A-chan should have enough of the first half. See where they spot it. Broke away that time from Taron Johnson. Nine yards here, about a yard short. Taron Johnson to be one of the top nickel corners. He was out last week. What a play by A-chan to be able to catch the ball and then make Johnson miss to be able to pick up those yards after the catch. It's all about tackling in space when you defend the speed of the Miami Dolphins. You might be there, but you've got to come up with a tackle. Second and one. Breaking the tackle. Gordon. Tied at 14. Bills get the second-hand kickoff. We go to Kaylee. Sean, describe the challenges that Miami Dolphins has given you. Well, right now, that drive in particular was third down. Third along, our rushing cover's got to work better together. Riley Patterson will send it down to Brandon Conkrington and Ty Johnson set up at the goal line. On the 66th degree night. Coming up the field at the 9-yard line. Codrington to the 40. To Kaylee. Moments to go. Mike, you told us that tonight would require your team's best football. How do you characterize what they've done through one half? So far, so good. But it's meaningless. Without another half, we have a lot of football to play and a lot of execution. What is the priority for your defense? You're playing one of the best players in the league. You got to be disciplined. You got to make him earn every yard. And if he gives you an op to take it away, you got to take advantage of it. Thank you. Well, they made him earn every yard on that last drive, and then they stopped him on the errant field goal. James Cook starts this drive here. Cook is now carried nine times for 74 yards this evening. I like to see this just to start the second half. First play, just kind of get things going here. Bang. just sending a message there by Butler 91, Matthew Butler. It's a nice job. He's flashed, you know, these first couple games against a run, and a big part of it is that right job plays like that, getting leverage, and it was Kincaid in motion. He just threw him back. All right, there he was at it. Alert it, alert it, alert it. Hey, Bob, it's good. Good, we're good. All right, there he was at it. Allen fires. That's caught. But stopped at the 46-yard line. Eon Coleman. Make it third down and two for Buffalo. Josh Allen has had a pretty good pocket most of the night. In fact, only been pressured one time tonight. That's when Bradley Chubb came up with that big third down sack to force the field goal that they eventually missed. But for the most part, he's been back there and able to survey this Dolphins secondary. Third down, about a yard and a half. Ty Johnson in the backfield. Allen protected well. Throws caught. First down. A lot more. Ty Johnson out of the backfield with a flag. Allen Eck is the referee. And the call is... Illegal contact. Number 29 defense. The penalty is declined. Goal to play. It's a first down. And Fitzpatrick. Ty Johnson is their third down back. He does a good job in pass pro. Here, they were able to leak him out. He's checking for the potential blitz of 20 there, Brooks. But Brooks ends up taking a man coverage. Josh Allen, that's probably the area he's grown, one of the areas he's grown the most, is taking it off a little bit of that touch ball, a little simple routine throw. Instead of putting a lot of heat on it, just a little touch ball, easy completion. first down over the middle, caught, first down gain of 15 here for Shakir, taking it to the 29 yard line Willie Gay came on the blitz, Josh Allen sees it, sees everything but he sees his pressure right here and he says, okay, no problem let's get the ball out, right where that blitz came from, big space so no huddle here Allen flushed out pump fakes throws knock down Brooks is there Jordan Brooks knocking down another flag here and a left tackle Dawkins holding Bradley Chubb again working to go by him the way he did with that sack all Dawkins could do is grab onto him holding number 73 offense 10 yard penalty replay first down you know to get a job as a referee you have to have great guns. Don't you make biceps? This is like the old Ed Hockley. Terry McCauley shaking his head. He's always in the gym pumping iron. Of course. You've got to live up to that reputation that Ed started years ago. You have to. And then you've got to go with a tight shirt. That's medium. Very important. No matter what the temperature is, tonight is perfect. Good luck doing that in December here. First and 20. And going to the 42-yard line, the rookie looking very good tonight. I can't remember the last time they had a back like this to give them, with all the speed, a guy that can run between the tackles and do this, be able to shake off of a would-be tackler and be able to pick up big yards after that. That's not a gain of one or two. Keeps his balance, and he's got the speed to show you what he can do. I guess maybe Ronnie Brown? I don't remember the last back they had that could do that kind of thing, that power. Ricky Williams? That's going way back. Of course it is. It's me. I'm going way back. Way back machine here. And way back goes him this time as Terrell Bernard takes care of Gordon in the backfield. So sing his praises, and of course the next thing he loses too. Yeah. of the linebackers that time. And Bernard is overlooked as, I think, one of the top linebackers. What he does for his defense, eight right in the middle. Watch him get downhill, not allowing the center, Aaron Brewer, to be able to climb up to that second level. That's textbook tackle. Great job. His instincts are really what separate him. He's not a big linebacker, 6'1", 225 in the middle. But great job and great football IQ. Second and 12. Tua flips it open. Connor, a flag is down. Julian Hill. They've got a lineman downfield. We saw that earlier. I think it's the rookie, the left guard. It's Vianaya. Ineligible player downfield. Number 72 offense. Five-yard penalty to the previous spot. Replay, second down. Well, that was a big, big mistake. The left guard, 72 right here. See him working downfield. Meanwhile, the Dolphins' defense, or the Bills' defense, they're going downfield with the speed. They finally get the ball to the tight end. Julian Hill, that's a first down and more. And instead, push him way back. Close to midfield in second and 17. Jonas Avayanaya. Making it second down and 17. Can't get out of the tackle of Christian Benford. A chance stopped there. Third and a mile. I'm going to put a little asterisk by that second down play because, boy, that's one to remember. You know, this first three weeks for Miami, it's been a lot of mistakes, right? The first couple. Turning to breathe free. Statue of Liberty on top of the Liberty Building here in Buffalo. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung. It's third down and 14. A little lateral here, dangerous play, but it's going to work for about 10 yards. Malik Washington and A-chan involved in that. They needed 14. It felt like they were calling that play. A little bit of a risk there, throwing it all the way across the field, to set up this play. Mike McDaniel already knew if they were able to execute there, they're probably going to be in a fourth and four, fourth and five, and here they are. Right, 36-yard line, fourth down and four. Hill moves to the outside. Tua looks that way, completes it to Waddle. So Waddle, two big catches tonight. One, of course, went for the touchdown. That goes for 15 on a fourth down. Well, you can't ask for much more than this. One of your fastest receivers against White, who's got some age, coming off some injuries, man-to-man, a little crosser. Just a foot race. You've got to outrun him, which he's able to do. Tua in rhythm, great protection. He's able to step up, make that accurate throw, and they're able to overcome the illegal man downfield to keep this drive alive, new set of downs. Tooth finally gets to 100 yards on his 26th pass of the night. Keep it on the ground. Big hole! Through the middle. First and goal. Devon Achan. So Achan, the workhorse tonight. Carried nine times, 56 yards. That's seven for Tote. Gain of 14 here. How about the backside? We talk about the Bills and their job of working on the backside. That time, a heck of a job by that big offensive line. pushing and opening that play up from the back. Great vision as well. Big block by Larry Boron. Still moving to the outside. A-chan again. One or two. Second and goal. Daniel Brunskill has come into the game. Should mention that for Keon. Coming to, I think, San Francisco this week. Yeah. Seattle with a win in Pittsburgh. Fourth and five, and they'll just run it all the way down and take the delay. Well, if you go back to 1990, of course, the Bills went to four consecutive field goals here. To completely wrap it up. Prater and the cake is good and that'll write a finish to it not wide right no you know that was the first before that was the closest the Buffalo game they lost four in a row the great Marv leading was the coach Kelly Thurman Thomas Andre Reid yeah I remember that kick I remember that moment I remember Whitney Houston singing the national anthem You know that was a Yeah that one of those because the country was one of those one piece of desert storm going on Exactly right It's the first time I went to a game where there were concrete barriers outside the stadium in Tampa. And we were not allowed at ABC in those years to fly anything, the blip of the helicopter, no. Shut it down. He said no. Who are your partners in that era? Frank Gifford, Dan Deardor. We did for a couple of them. Seahawks and Cardinals next week. Rams 49ers the week after. Two weeks in a row. We see the entire NFC Western Division. So for Miami, it's back home. They have an extra three days to prepare for their next game against the New York Jets. You know, what's great for Buffalo is when you have a game like this, they didn't play their best football. They took on a team that was fighting. You end up putting up 31 points. You win by 10. And yet you can go back to the film room. Coach McDermott can look at this and say, and he's got a team that's hungry, that wants to keep getting better. And he can show them, you know, this happened and this happened. And so it's great early in the year when you can have a win like this. It isn't your best effort. and you can advance with still a 3-0 record and you can still look and have opportunities to not have to go through a loss to have to have those opportunities. Tango Bailoa 21-32 tonight. 133. Put up some more numbers here down the sideline. Out of bounds goes Tanner Connor. Third team tight end. 16-6 left. Yeah, just like Miami's showing all night, you thought they may just kind of get out of here and the game's over, but they're going to fight all the way here to the end, even though they're down 10. Play it to the finish. Plenty of smiles on that bench, even though I think they had a little more than they might have thought to have to handle tonight. Trying to pad the stat sheet. No, almost a pick there. 10 in for Hill. Second and 10. What's your college game this week? Where are you going? I'm actually going to Miami tonight. Right, there you go. Get down there probably around 2, 2 or 3. Okay. Have a meeting at 9 a.m. Game day. College game day meeting. Miami Hurricanes off to a pretty good start. They play the Florida Gators down in Miami. Yep. Should be a fun one. doing game day and then calling the game down in Miami. Oh, good. Next week will be a hoot. Charlottesville to Gorvallis? That's your all-timer. Second and ten. Catch is made here. Malik Washington. Add to his numbers. Takes it inside the 40 and takes us to the end of the game. So Josh Allen 22-28. The three touchdown passes, 200 now for the regular season in his career. They do it again. Completely dominated the Miami Dolphins over the last several seasons. So they're off and running, and again with the Buffalo Bills, they look good. Flag is thrown. and Buffalo's backing up. Holding number 86 offense. 10-yard penalty from spot a foul. Replay. First out. Kincade. Here he is right here. And on the end man. this defense has stepped up time and time again all things considered I know they've given up 28 but what they were facing with the injuries done a pretty good job of making some big plays especially in this second half can they do it one more time to give this Miami Dolphins a shot first and 20 on the ground hit from behind James Cook the third down. Miami will use a timeout here the 17th timeout Miami 32nd timeout 249 you got one more timeout you also have the two minute warning if somehow Miami could pull it out the upcoming schedule at the Panthers charges that's a tough one obviously in Miami at Cleveland. Yeah, I mean... It's not murderer's role. No, not at all. Not at all. Look at what Buffalo has still coming up on the back end of this Miami game. And New Orleans comes in here for an afternoon game. They're playing so many games at night. I was being told the ticket situation for that game is unlike anything they've seen for a while here because the crowd is so used to having to come here at night they can't wait to come here in the daytime. Right. Well, Miami's putting all their chips in the middle of the table. Got to get a stop here on these next two plays. Second and 16. Allen stepping up. Fires caught. And off to the races. Inside the 40 to the 35 goes Elijah Moore. Had a touchdown last week. That's a 30-yard gain. and now they put them between the rock and the hard place because they can take it down in the two-minute warning and they only have one time out. And you have two defenders right here and then watch the safety in the back end. The corner actually. He clears out. He's headed. They got three defenders deep and there's no one left to be able to make a tackle on an underneath throw. Good vision. Good job by Josh Allen of locating more and there's more yards after the catch by the Bills. They let the clock run down to two minutes. Good to take us to go. Everything in their favor right now as James Cook picks up a couple. Second down. Stay tuned after the game, the JCPenney post-game show. They heard a lot of noise. They came out, competed. This is, I hate to say you're 0-3 and, you know, moral victories and that kind of thing, but it's a team that at least showed that they have a lot ahead of them if they can keep playing the way they did tonight. Terry Pagula, the owner, CEO, vice president, also runs the Buffalo Sabres of the national hockey. Hockey season is on the horizon, new boy. Second and seven. Cook. One of so many of these games in the National Football League come down to it, it's a huge mistake. In this case, it was the roughing the punter penalty. Yeah. You hate to put it all on Seeler, but that was, you know, just that he's trying to make a play. He thinks he can reach and do it. That's a big man going, elevating, tough to have body control when you're that big, goes right through the snapper, and thinks he has a shot with that left hand and just ends up roughing him. Gave Josh Allen another opportunity, and they capitalized, ended up taking a lead. Yes, shielded with a penalty. And then the interception shielded, no pun intended. But fourth down now. They want to go for the three or let it all run down and don't have to run a play until there's about 25 seconds remaining. Next week with Seattle and Arizona. Be a good one. Well, Arizona right now 2-0. Arizona goes Smith doing a heck of a job there. That was a part of that with Borum, as you mentioned, on that backside. He's now in. He's a guy that can play center or guard. And right now he's in there. They're using everybody this week on this offensive line with the injuries. and yet here they are showing a lot of pride, fighting their tails off. Second and goal. Clap, clap, clap. They clock at one. Two and back it up. Two and in the end zone. Car. Touchdown. Tyreek Hill. Couple of flips. And a point away from tying the game. What a route by Tyreek Hill. And good patience off that play action by Tua to let him be able to set up Benford on this route. Sells into the inside and it works back to the outside. Meanwhile, Tua coming off the play action gets some pressure. Throws it off the back foot perfectly where Hill can come down with that touchdown. What a drive. Riley Patterson to tie the game. And he does. 12-18. Left in regulation. 21-21. Stepped up at number 10. Often tonight has been on the other end. And Hill who ended last season by saying I want out and walked that back. And he's had a big night. Five catches, 49 yards. And with a new touchback rule, this comes out to the 35-yard line for Allen and company. Here we go. I don't know if the Bills or their fans thought it would be 21-21 with 12-18 to go in the ballgame, but this is going to be a great drive. It's going to be fun to see how Josh Allen, who's as confident as any quarterback in this league, responds after Tua just tied this game up. And the Miami D doing its job tonight. Again, shredded at Indy. Last week, gave up scores on the first three drives before they finally settled down, even though they lost the game. But tonight, some big, big stops. Five, five, five. Two, three, two, three. Hello. Hi, Danny, what's up? Start with a run. Cook. Lots of room. Gets stripped up. See where they spot it. Dante Trader Jr. making the tackle. Enough for a first down. Yeah, Spencer Brown to right tackle. 79-85 there. You see him. The rookie Jackson Falls. He's able to open that up, and it doesn't take much room at all because of the vision and the acceleration of James Cook. He finds that crease, and he is gone. 13 carries, 92 yards for Cook. 14th carry, nothing. Now let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS on James Cook. 71 total yards after contact, entering this drive, almost 6 yards after contact per carry. You can see at the bottom, fourth most yards and third most average of a career. So this guy is undersized but runs with great heart and determination. Really become a complete back over the last couple years. 71 of the 92 yards. Allen throws. Hold in, 48-yard line. Dawson handles Cook at that point, third down. Remember now, as much as this offense is capable of doing, Miami's made some adjustments in this second half, and the last two drives that the Bills have had the ball, this defense has forced them to punt the football, and they got them to a third down again. Got Jalen Phillips moved inside here. Elijah Moore. on the left side, wide left. Allen looking that way, Allen throwing that way, and that's incomplete. Coverage is good, trying to get it to Moore. Jack Jones with the coverage, fourth down. Jack Jones, we've seen him make some plays tonight against the run. What I want you to watch is his eyes. Sits back, now he sees the ball about to be thrown. That's when he reacts, and looking to work around with that. His body gets the right arm out in front of the receiver. anticipating that throw because of the down and dis of Shakur to be able to get upfield after that reception. It's a foot race and an easy touchdown there for the Bills. Allen now 200 regular season touchdown passes. And the extra point by Prater is good. So the roughing, the kicker is the killer on this drive. 28-21. Kills. You know, he's no stranger to off-the-field stuff. That's been the whole career. Part of the reason he got traded to Miami in the first place. But for the moment, the league investigates and see what happens. Here's the kick at the 9-yard line. That's Ridge coming back up the middle to the 38. I think anybody who's watched this game tonight has been impressed. People wonder what kind of heart, what kind of attitude they show up with tonight for Miami. How about Ollie Gordon? The effort in this last drive to be able to get almost 18 yards after contact. Fourth and four. Hit a crosser here to Jalen Waddell to keep the drive alive. And then here, the timing off the play action by Tua to find Tyreek Hill. For the touchdown, they tied it up. Now, that's the last time they had the ball. The Bills obviously have taken a lead. But Mike McDaniels called a heck of a game to give his team a chance tonight. From the 37 on first down. A chance. Into a mob. Gained him a couple. It'll be second down and eight. And we talked earlier, Al, two is not having a game where you're going to look up and say, Oh, he's throwing for 350. He's only throwing for 105. but two touchdowns, and more importantly, no turnovers, no interceptions, making good decisions, not forcing the ball. To it. Spins around, goes downfield, and Hill can't hold on. Probably would have been out of bounds anyway, just over the chalk. So now third down at eight. Now that's one of those throws where you're thinking, what happened if he's late? The reason he's late is watch the pressure. This is something you miss. Bosa's effort makes him have to reset, and that just little reset makes the ball late and out of bounds to a wide open Tyreek Hill. So a play you might not really pay attention to, but Joey Bosa just made an impact on that second down and long. Right now, once again on third down, crowd rises as one. Third and eight. To the outside. Caught. Another big catch by Waddle. But a touchdown pass, but a fourth down pass keeps this drive going. There's the timing there with Tua. Gets back three steps in the pocket. The ball is out well before Waddle even gets out of his break. Ball's out. And there's nothing that White can do to defend that. When Tua's in rhythm and he gets back with his accuracy and you're playing soft like that, that's pitching and catching for Tua with his receivers. Ball to 50. Six minutes left in the fourth. To the outside, A-Chang. Gained two out of bounds. 48-yard line, second and eight. Had a chance to talk with Frank Smith, the offensive coordinator. from Miami this week, and he made an interesting point. He said, you know, we want the Bills to feel our speed, meaning our get-off at the line of scrimmage. And I was thinking, of course, the receivers. He said, yeah, the receivers, but even the offensive line. We want them to feel those first two or three steps and how it can slow down a defense and how it can impact them and kind of intimidate them. They've done a pretty good job of that overall tonight. They've got the speed. Second and eight. To it. Throws. Caught. To the 44. Julian Hill. Sackled there by Shaq Thompson. To another big third down. Third and four. Now remember last time they had the ball in a similar area on the field. It was much longer a third down. And they called a play to get them to a fourth and three, fourth and four. So at this point in the game, this is obviously four-down territory. See what they come up with here on this third down and short. Loudest this stadium's been all night. 9 of 14 are the Dolphins on third down, one for one on fourth down. Timeout is taken here. First charge timeout. Stinson is able to knock that away, and Josh Allen says, Come on, man, he's on his back. Where's the flag? No call. third straight punt for the Bills. Cameron Johnson came over from Pittsburgh. Rand Robbins got released. He takes over. Punt is with a flag down, and the punt's going to be downed at the two-yard line, but you've got Zach Seeler making contact. That's exactly right. He roughed him. He blew him up. Roughing the kicker, number 92. Roughing the kicker is going to be a first down. Right, running into it would have been a fourth and two. Yeah, he blew a first down. Blew him up. Sealer is an eight-year veteran, one of the best players on this defense. blows up the long snapper and tries to make a play. And because of that effort, it cost him. Clearly roughs the punter. And the Bills catch a break. Terry, you're in compliance with that call, huh? Absolutely, Al. He follows through with forcible contact to the plant leg. Automatic 15. Again, the third straight series. They would have had Josh Allen in this offense off the field. and now you're going to give in the football at the 36-yard line in a tie game. Instead of Miami, we would have had it in its own two. That was a heck of a punt to begin with. Hook. He takes it to the 30-yard line. Ten minutes left in regulation. You know, you have this offense somewhat bottled up, And you just feel like at any moment, especially after a break like that, at any moment they're capable of just, whether it's Cook that hits a crease and goes 30, or they catch you with your eyes in the backfield and they hit play action and hit it tight end. You just feel like how long can you keep bottling up this offense until something's going to give. Cook again. Touch it back. Gets stripped up. That saved at least for the moment of first down. That's Mika Fitzpatrick. Started his career with the Dolphins. Went to Pittsburgh. Then comes back in the trade that sent Jalen Ramsey the other way. John Lewis-Smith as well. Third down and one. Every third down now, big. Under nine to play. Johnson, the third down back. Hand it to him. First down, Ty Johnson. Wrestled back. Gets to the 20-yard line, first and ten. The Dolphins were so concerned about Josh Allen and getting upfield. The left side really didn't have anybody to block. He was able to hit that underneath because the defense was, like I said, coming up field. So they convert. And now down in this red zone area, things get tighter. Josh Allen, typically the ball comes out quicker. Always got to factor in his legs down here, especially in a tight game in the fourth quarter. Are we good? Hey, mind you, mind you, mind you. Are we good? No, we're good. Allen fires. Caught by Joshua Palmer. Comes over from the Chargers after four years there. Gain of five. Second and five. He just saw soft coverage on his inside receiver. Just said instead of making this real elaborate, let's just take the easy yards here. Positive yards. Nine different receivers tonight They had nine in the opener against Baltimore They had eight last week Spreading the wealth Second and five Outside to Shakir Inside to 10 Shakir on the way in Touchdown Buffalo How about the orbit motion there that they use? Good indicator that they've got man-to-man coverage. That's what Buffalo likes to do. They motion, see how the defense responds. Corner goes with them. They know what they got. Now just get it to them quickly. A couple blocks. How about Kincaid right there? He's able to seal the edge and the speed and quickness. Miami, 30-second timeout. Well, a lot of people thought Miami was a dead, a dead animal coming into this game. But here, you know, short week, all kinds of stuff going on down there, players only meeting, planes flying, banners and all that. Have to make the trip up here to Buffalo. At least the good thing was early in the season. Yeah. When Miami comes to Buffalo, you want to come in September. Yeah, exactly. But I'll tell you what, again, we don't know how this game's going to end. I don't know what signs are flying around or who's responsible for that, but this team, this team's shown a lot tonight considering everything that they're facing. Let's see what happens here in these final four minutes and 40 seconds. To the outside, another conversion, and it's Waddle again. Big catch after big catch for him tonight. and Tyreek Hill is in front of him forcing Benford to have to respect 10. We know what 10's capable of so he just trails him. Just sits out there, the safety bishop a little bit late to get out there. Another well-designed play by McDaniel. Good job of getting the ball out to another playmaker and nice poise by Tua who just feels like he's in command tonight in this hostile environment. Five catches for a while, all of them important. Either third down or fourth down or a touchdown. Now, over the left side, goes Ollie Gordon. Picking up three of four. Four and a half to go in regulation. Of course, we talk about Mike McDaniel, and we talked about Tua, and we talk about Tyree Kill. We brought it up a number of times, but it's worth saying it again. This is an offensive line that really the only guy you knew what you had was Aaron Brewer at center. Everybody else is either a first-time starter or a very inexperienced player. And let's tip our cap to the way these guys have played tonight as well. I don't know, again, how they're going to finish up, but they've played well to give them a shot here. For sure. Second and six. And coming around, Washington. Washington trying to get that first down and dives for it. Looks like they're going to mark it just a little bit short. And they do. Terran Johnson makes that play even with two big linemen out the front. Good job of getting around them, keeping him short at his first down. Tua typically in the gun. That's the replay. There you go. Oh. Break for Miami. Spotted now at the 22-yard line at first down. That's what replay assist looked at right there. Yeah, clearly. Great job of picking that up as quickly as they did. And how about the effort, by the way, by Malik Washington. You'd think of another speedster in this offense. But there he got hit, kept his balance, and then dove for that first down. Tua, throw! And it's intercepted! It's picked off at about the 20-yard line. Carol Bernard with the huge interception. Now, watch the eyes of Tua. Watch where his head looks. and watch how it brings the linebacker over to be able to make this play. His eyes are looking far right. Linebacker Bernard's able to feel that and sense that and be able to step right in front of the intended target. And Deion Walker got in his face as he threw it to get the assist. Here's A-Chan going out in the flat. Here's the linebacker. He looks off to his right, and in doing so, he's trying to move this defender right here outside. He didn't even take into consideration Bernard. When he looked to the outside flat with A-Chan to move the other linebacker, he just, it was a blind spot. He, for whatever reason, did not see Bernard as he tried to come back to the inside, and Bernard read the eyes along the way, took him right to the throwing lane, and made an easy interception for him because of the eyes of Tua. Second big play of the season for Bernard, who recovered a Derrick Henry fumble in the opener, leading to Buffalo's miracle win. Meanwhile, on the outside, now back to the inside, goes Elijah Moore.
