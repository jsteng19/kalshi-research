 Third and three to keep moving the ball. We're moving the ball. We're getting some positive plays. We can't have penalties. Penalties have really been a big issue in the first quarter. Very good. And right on cue. How's that? You need some big plays. O'Connell to Jacoby Myers all the way downfield. Check this one out. Gain of 43. And that little movement right there, I think, affects the communication. Because this is a bust right here. This is Johnson who's still kind of feeling his way. He thinks he's got safety support behind him. But Conner's manned up on the inside. Great job here by O'Connell, recognizing that, getting the ball out over top to Myers for a big gain here. Raiders from the 29. O'Connell. Has time. Throws into traffic, and somehow, someway, he comes up with that one, does Jacoby Myers. This is a risk, throwing this football. This shows you how much trust he has in Myers. But what happens here is Trent McDuffie, who's very good in this slot spot, he's inside where he's normally dominant. Watch how he never finds the football. Good job at the line of scrimmage, a little inside move. Ball's already in the air, and by the time McDuffie looks for it, Myers had adjusted back to the inside on an underthrown football. So 43 followed by 24. Back-to-back to Jacoby Myers. Who split to the left on a first and goal. Whistle before the play. False start. Offense number 89. Five-yard penalty. First down. Side end, Brock Bowers. We came in expecting to call his name a bunch today. We just even said for them to hang around in this game. 89 is going to have to get his hands on the ball. and instead it's Jacoby Myers making plays here, especially in this drive. The Holmes always has that kind of impassive look on the sideline. Okay. Yeah. All right, just give me the ball back. I'll get out there. We'll get out there. First and goal. Play action. Rolling. Throwing. Caught. To the four-yard line goes Brock Bowers. Drew Tranquil stops in there. second down and goal. Good job of, again, they're trying to move him around. That time lined up on the left side. Gets lost a little bit there in coverage off the play action look. Love the aggressive call there by Scott Turner on first and, well, with a penalty first and 15. Saw Bolton shaking up at the end of the first quarter. He's back in there. Drive started at their own eight-yard line. Second down and goal. The Bowers into the slot to the right. Blake Lockett won. Keep it on the ground. Into a brick wall goes Abdullah. Third and goal. Antonio Pierce during the week goes hey it's the worst team in football against the best have some fun what the heck it sure helps when your quarterback can make a few throws that's been a difference getting a quarterback that can get the ball downfield and be decisive not back there holding on to it Powers is going to be out to his right Myers wide left O'Connell in the pocket. Breaks away. Down he goes at the nine-yard line. Chakes down by Chris Jones. Hadn't mentioned his name until now, but sooner or later here comes 95. A matter of time, especially on these third-down situations, to get matched up against a rookie, but this is really as much about coverage as it is anything. That and a relentless approach by 95. I think he's looking initially to Brock Bowers to the right. Now he steps up. This is not his game. Creating and getting away from a pass rush is not what Aiden O'Connell is known for. And Jones brings him down. Daniel Carlson for the 27-yard field goal attempt. Kick is good to tie it. Jones was hungry. Hadn't had a sack since week four. There he is. He's drafted over the last decade, and he's the only guy as a starter to win that Super Bowl. Like you said, three of them. I feel like he's still just warming up. I feel like he's, who knows how many he's going to end up with. As motivated as ever. and this is I told you in the meeting it's like you run out of things to say when Tiger Woods was in his prime that's where we are with Mahomes I mean he's accurate but what are we worried about for Mahomes the concern with that left tackle as he gets hit he's able to make that throw almost against his body and look at the location of that football and a heck of a job on the back end by Watson trying to secure that as Jones knocks away that football. Extra point by Wright. History made there. 238. Regular season. Touchdown passes for that man. Eclipsing the mark held by Len Dawson. The Holmes and the Chiefs. What's up? What do you say his face was, as the Raiders were moving the ball, he just kind of over there. You know, hey. All right. Tribute to Len, the great Len Dawson, quarterback for this team back in the first Super Bowl following the 1966 season. Holmes, you just get the feeling, hey, whatever it is, wherever we are. I mean, this year in particular, five games have gone down in the last play. Last play. 8-1 possession games. Look at that. Almost like against his body. And look at the location. And again, Jones plays that football. He doesn't give up on it. Watson deserves, again, a lot of credit for being able to hold on to that football there because he got that right hand in there to separate. Antonio Pierce called that timeout with the understanding they still have the two-minute warning, still have two timeouts, try to get the field goal range, and they get the ball to start the second half. Look at the goal line by Lowby, and he'll bring it back out to the 19-yard line. He'll start from there. And see, stuff like that, we ask about what makes him so great. That's it. On the sideline after a touchdown, talking to the linemen, talking to the receivers, talking to the backs. That's kind of that secret sauce. It's not just the execution on the field we all marvel at. It's what he does in the locker room, what he does on the sidelines, how he communicates. Matt Nagy there with him. They never stop. It's never enough with him. It's the all-time love affair in this town, too. I mean, so great in the community on every level as the Raiders now try to cut into the lead before halftime to the 35-yard line goes McCormick, and that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. So the Raiders still have two timeouts, two minutes to the half. Kansas City on top 10-3 on Black Friday. Which is presented by Royal Caribbean. Above Arrowhead Stadium. Welcome back in 1972. Chiefs on top by a score of 10-3. It'll be first down. For the Raiders from the 35-yard line. O'Connell, 8 of 11 for 108 yards. Coming around is Tucker. Tucker diving. And that's the first time. It's 11. They've been running the football between the tackles. We talked about how that's one of the changes with Scott Turner. Getting the ball downhill. And I'll tell you, this McCormick is doing a heck of a job when he's been in there, giving him some physical running. But that time when you can run inside, and you start to lull that defense into thinking it's more in the interior, and then you can get that jet sweep going around the edge there. So the worst rushing team in the league has 57 yards on the ground, averaging 5.7 per carry. O'Connell on the left sideline, and that's broken up. Intended there for D.J. Turner would be second down. It's interesting. You look at some of these numbers. 57 yards on the ground for Las Vegas 10 for Kansas City Neewa There they are Trying to work off the Triptophan hangover Our gang there Yes, I know, Richard I got you, man But you know I'm right You know I'm right State Farm halftime show coming up Second and 10 On the ground, looking for room, finds none. Sincere McCormick, third down. These weren't so good, we could have headed over there. Room service where? Your favorite. Anyway, Arrowhead Stadium. Starting early here. Oh, yeah. Sparkling day. Plus, you had a great meal last night. Absolutely. kickoff bounding through the end zone and we take a look at Aiden O'Connell so he's back he lost the job to Gardner Minshew early in the season, got it back then he fractured his thumb he's been out for four weeks and now he's back because Minshew was out having broken his collarbone last week and I think having him back honestly I think it's big, I think this team believes in him they love his approach, kind of a quiet guy in the building, but shows up First guy there, works hard. His preparation, I think, has earned the respect of his teammates. The best thing he can do is he's decisive. Gets the ball out quickly. They want to try to run the football. Been a problem all year and put him in a spot to get the ball downfield. And here Abdullah is the running back. They're minus their two top running backs, among other things today. Rolling, throwing, caught on the run. And again, a few there for Jacoby Myers, who, once Devontae Adams did, has become the number one receiver. Yeah, and I think when Devontae Adams got traded there in mid-October, it really freed up not just Jacoby Myers to become the top receiver, but it also freed up this Raiders team to get the ball to Brock Bowers even more. The rookie tight end out of Georgia, as good a tight end, I think, as you'll see, especially as a young player in the NFL. They move him around. He's got to have a big day today if the Raiders are going to hang around. Number 89, you saw Antonio Pierce took over last year midseason. Got the job on a permanent basis. And working his way is Abdullah up to the 40-yard line. The minus Alexander Madison, Zamir White would be their two top guys. So this is a team, and again, every team in the league has their share of injuries. These guys have had a little bit more. Yeah, they really have. When you lose your top backs, you fire your offensive coordinator in the middle of the year. And, you know, you have Scott Turner take over. We'll talk more about that. Norv Turner up in the booth with him, his dad. They have to be able to run the ball tonight. Every team wants to run the ball. These guys are dead last in the league. It's got to be a priority tonight to make this Chiefs defense have to respect it. We're night animals. We think it's tonight. It's actually the middle of the day. I get the point, though. It's a four-yard game here. Jacoby Myers, it's so weird calling a game in the day, isn't it? Call Saturday night games. It's like, oh, Thursday night? Yeah, it's weird to see the sun out. And Troy Aikman, so many great teams he's been a part of over the years. Yeah, he gave the induction screens for Troy Aikman when Troy got into the Hall of Fame. Nice hole here, but it closes quickly. To the 48, the ball is out. The ball is out. But they're going to say with a flag down. We're going to get down by contact there as Connor came in. So he got it to the 48-yard line. Clay Martin, we'll hear from him. in a moment. Holding. Offense number 58. Ten-yard penalty. Second down. That's the rookie out of Oregon. Second round pick, Jackson Powers Johnson. JPJ. Maybe happens early. Yeah, just gets up around the neck of Wharton and takes him down. He's a nasty offensive lineman. You saw him play quite a bit in college in Oregon. Now getting an opportunity to play. They got a couple rookie starting today. The right tackle DJ Glaze as well. So second and 16 from the 34 yard line. Four man rush. Flushed out. Eyes downfield. Throws into some traffic in front of the Chiefs bench and that's Roots Frank will break it up. This is the defense that's coming in with a bit of a chip on their shoulder over the last two weeks against Buffalo and then Carolina. They gave up more points than they probably care to do. Spag's the defense coordinator, one of the best in the NFL. Kind of working through some things on the back end because of some injuries themselves that they've dealt with. And they want to crank the pressure up much, much more than they have here the last few weeks after this quarterback. That yielded 30 to Buffalo and a loss yielded 27 to Carolina and won it at the gun last week. Third and 16. Sent it out to the sideline and well short of the first down is Bowers. So it'll be fourth down and 10 as Bowers makes his first grab and 73rd of the season. Raiders are just not equipped, especially against his Chiefs defense, to have a holding call, get behind the two. touchdown catches over his first 60-some-odd games and four in the last two games. Yeah, done a good job of learning for the best in Travis Kelsey. We were just talking about Crosby. He's out in coverage. So instead of rushing the quarterback, the big fella right in the middle kind of playing an off-ball linebacker, reading the eyes of Mahomes and gets fooled completely in space. From the 27 after a gain at 27. Mahomes on the move, slides to a stop. And meanwhile, the crowd wants a flag because you had Zach Carter coming in there, but no flag. And they're doing an interesting job with this defense. That time they dropped a defensive lineman instead of Crosby. Now you're seeing Tyree Wilson drop. So a lot of different looks, trying to confuse. Just a little push there. You see Mahomes lifting his hands. And, of course, it's Crosby involved. Anytime he's always trying to send messages, at least Morris responded by pushing him off. The crowd responds, too, when they take a look. Always looks worse on the big board. Oh, yeah. If anybody breathes on Mahomes, this crowd's not going to like it. Second and ten. Mahomes gets that one away, and it's knocked down. Knocked down there by La'ulu. Jonah Laulu, third down and 10. They are trying to come up with chains-ups. How do you defend Mahomes? What can you do? The guy has seen everything. Everybody usually drops coverage, but how do you drop coverage? Any kind of little different wrinkle you can give him, and right now Patrick Graham, that's what he's trying to do, mixing up looks, trying to make him be patient, trying to confuse him with some of the movement they have on that defensive line. Who's dropping into coverage? Mahomes. Clean pocket. The ball is slipped from Kelsey back to Pirine. That didn't take long. Kelsey catches it. Almost in one move is able to lateral the ball to Pirine. Yeah, and it's almost a no look. Don't forget he was a quarterback. That's a no look. That's just a feel. That's something you mess around with at a practice, and it gets so comfortable that all of a sudden you're able to unveil that and do it in a game. Not that high a risk at all. That ball is pitched perfectly to Pirine, and he got the first down yardage after that pitch. From the 12, on the ground, picking up about four or five. You're so right. You see the guys are fooling around, screwing around at practice, and all of a sudden, hey, you know what? We can pull this off in a game. Man, it is just, it's one thing to do it, but do you have to look that smooth when you do it? I mean, it's just no look. Oh, man. And his biggest fan, I think, is probably a fan of that play. First down. They did the same thing back November 4th against the Bucs on a Monday night football game. Right. Second and six, three minutes to the half. Mahomes throws. It's caught, and then going to his knees at that spot is Kelsey. For Travis Kelsey, already that is a total of six catches. He had ten catches in their first game earlier this season when the Chiefs won 27-20. Yeah, and this is that red zone area we talked about. The Chiefs are going to move the ball. People are going to sit back, make them execute down in the red zone. This Raiders team, I mean, a 2.30 to go in the first half. So far, only giving up three points. And here we are again to a third down moment here for Mahomes. He ran the third down back and timeout is taken by Las Vegas. Called their first timeout in the half. 30 seconds. We've seen Mahomes and Kelsey over the last how many years? They just seem to always have a feel. Watch the route. He knew that he had a free play there. I think what's incredible is just sometimes the routes are designed, and other times it's just Kelsey feeling it and finding the space, and Mahomes trusting him, finding him, and still throwing in rhythm. The timing is perfect. They play man coverage. He always gets separation. You play zone, he finds the void in the zone, and that time he just improvises and makes a play to get that first down deeper into red zone territory. So third and four Mahomes hit as he throws And in the end zone Justin Watson Touchdown Stevers get behind him And that's where they've missed Pacheco Making defenses pay for that approach Second down and six Fake toss Then a little shovel pass To Kareem Hunt who's back in there So Pacheco in for one play Fractured fibula week two against Cincinnati. You know, they've had their share of injuries. Of course, every other team in the league says, oh, excuse us. Right, exactly. It's good to see him. How about that little wrinkle from Andy Reid? Puts Xavier Worthy next to Mahomes and then lines Hunt up in that kind of that H-back spot and gives him that shovel pass. Nagga Pacheco lined up here. In the backfield. Takes the handoff. Should have enough. First down. What explosion was Spillane, the middle linebacker, downhill linebacker. I think he welcomes the challenge, one of the leaders along with Max Strosby on this defense. And that was a big collision. Right here, he's going to get downhill and try to keep him short against that diamond formation. Bang, hits him right at the line. And just enough for the first down. Spillane having an outstanding season. Pacheco is the running back. play action swings is short, incomplete second down and ten let's go down to Kaylee guys, I'm told when Isaiah Pacheco arrived at Arrowhead today he had a fire in his eyes that made nine games that he missed after he fractured his right fibula and damaged ligaments in that ankle it took a titanium plate and seven screws to stabilize the bone in his lower shin he returned to practice last week and Mahomes told us Pacheco wanted to play Sunday but they held him back because they know how hard he plays. So here he is. Staying in. Second and ten. Four minutes into the game. Chiefs on the move. Deep downfield. One on one there. A one handed catch not made by Hopkins. Almost had the opportunity but he got a flag at the end of the play so Mahomes has already taken his team downfield thinking it'll be defensive pass interference. on Jack Jones. Pass interference. Defense number 18. It's a spot foul. Automatic first down. Again, you're just not used to seeing people challenge Mahomes and these receivers. And I'm sure he's welcoming it. Shows you the confidence the Raiders have in Jones and others to hang out on these islands. He does a pretty good job staying step for step there. He's in phase, but the hands got a little bit involved there. and the fact he's not looking back to find the football probably is what drew the foul. Almost caught it as well. There's Aiden O'Connell awaiting his turn, but the ball is at the 13-yard line. Quick pass. Kelsey makes the grab. Kelsey to the 7-yard line. Stop there by Isaiah Polamau. Interesting. They sit back down in this red area where Mahomes is always looking to find his tight ends, of course, Kelsey. but they had really soft coverage, made it simple for Mahomes to abort anybody else and immediately get the ball to Travis Kelsey. Already run 11 plays. When you win the toss, what do you do? You defer and look what happens to you. Got to stop him on their 12th play here on a second down and four. Mahomes rolling and spinning and twirling and the pass is incomplete, intended for Hunt. Third down and four. Yeah, that's the one area that obviously Mahomes and the Chiefs, the biggest concern they have is giving him enough time. Usually it comes off the edges. Today against Max Crosby, that'll be a great matchup to see if they can protect him, especially in obvious passing situations. That time, it was just a good push in the interior that time. Key Ryan is now the back. One of the backs in and out. Former Cincinnati Bengal played in the Super Bowl against the Rams three years ago. Send him in motion. Mahomes fires, and that's tipped and incomplete. Trying to get it to Hopkins. Covered there by Jack Jones, and they'll have to settle for a field goal attempt with a brand-new field goal kicker. He's Harrison Butker. He's hurt back in a couple of weeks. Schrader kicked last week, but he's hurt now. Now watch this move right before the snap. You see that inside leverage? He took away the slant. That's just a great play by Jones to, right before the snap, take one or two steps inside, almost anticipating that quick slant, and he took that leverage away from Hopkins. He didn't have much of a chance there. Here's Matthew Wright, just signed him. He'd been with Kansas City before. We saw him on a Thursday night with San Francisco against Seattle. He got hurt in that one. They bring him in at least for a couple of games. Sticks like that, get into these obvious passing situations against the Chiefs. the pressure they have and the way they can match up in the back end. A.J. Cole to putt. One of the best in the league, in fact. The number has proven 52.9. His average. Hardman is there. Flag is thrown. The ball will bounce and go out of bounds at the one-yard line. But there's a penalty marker down. Clay Martin is back. That's a holding call on the Raiders. Yeah, where the... Yeah, the up back had a holding call. So, a great punt. Just talked about how good he is. During the kick, holding, receiving team number 53. Penalty is half the distance to the goal from the end of the kick. First down. Timeout. Half the distance is about the half-yard line. Doesn't get any better than that. Chiefs have the ball. Up 3-0 on Black Friday. Here's what happened. When we left, we went to commercial. Clay Martin had said the penalty was against the Chiefs. He meant it was against the Raiders. So after the teams had gone down to the half-yard line to start a Chiefs drive, he realized the penalty was not on the Chiefs. It was on the Raiders. So they had to re-kick while you were gone. We're still here with you. The ball is now at the 23-yard line. Terry, what do you make of it? It's just an administrative error by the referee. He clearly punched out for commercial, as we say. They're supposed to wait for TV to get back before they put the ball back in play. They didn't. We missed the play. It clearly was on the kicking team, as you see right there, number 53. So just an administrative mistake that just shouldn't have happened. And a 22-and-a-half-yard difference. Yeah. And maybe they hold it for linear, but not for streaming. I don't know. I'm going to tell you. Anyway, we're all caught up. And Kansas City has the ball in its own 23-yard line. And a great reminder for folks that have not seen a lot of the Chiefs. This team, in the past, early years of Mahomes, it was about the explosive offense. And the last couple years, because of the style of defense they've played, it's now about sustaining drives. It's about short game, passing game, intermediate passing game, running the football. Last drive they had, what, 14 plays? And so that's kind of the new Mahomes offense because of the way teams typically try to defend them and not give him those home run threats. Well, they've had 32 drives of 10 more plays. I guess 33, counting this last one, which was 14 plays leading to a field goal. That's most in the league. So you're looking at that. That's like almost three long drives per game. Yeah, and again, it's a credit really to Mahomes and Andy Reid for adjusting from where they were three or four years ago to how teams now defend them. They've had to become more patient. They've come up with an answer. Initially, it was a little bit of a challenge for them. Now it's what they see every week. So it's what they know. It forces them to be patient, and they go to their running game and that short passing game and yards after the catch. is what now becomes a premium. Start the drive with a run here, a two-yard pickup for Kareem Hunt. And what it does, it really shows the relationship between Mahomes, Kelsey, the other tight end, Noah Gray, Juju Smith-Schuster, even DeHop coming over. Those guys are a big part of that short and intermediate passing game and finding that soft spot in the zone. and boy, 15 has a way of locating you and getting the ball to you. Second down and eight. Protection. Making the catch. On the move. There it is. Travis Kelsey. It's so funny. He's got the other tight end, Noah Gray, who's really come into his own as well. So much of this offense now revolving around these two guys. Watch Diablo, who's a former safety out of college. Nobody can stay with him. The way he was running that route initially, you think he's going at a shallow cross, and then he puts the foot in the ground, works back the other way, and, of course, Mahomes finds him quickly for that first down. Already three catches for Travis on first down. Mahomes catches made, breaking a tackle here. Juju Smith-Schuster. and the extra yardage enough for a first down. And right on cue, really, from what we talked about at the outset of this drive, how teams are defending them and the answer to that, there it is. On the same page where he's improvising on his route, it's Chris Jones. We talk about Mahomes' leadership and Kelsey's leadership. Look how much these guys care. Look how much they communicate. That's why they are who they are right there. The focus on that sideline is the communication. Let's talk about a big series for the Raiders. They're just not equipped to get down 17-3 to Mahomes and have a chance of coming back to win this game. Second and 10. Mahomes fires. That's caught. That's Gray. And Gray takes the ball into Vegas territory to the 47-yard line. Noah Gray. So Gray's not caught. Gray Kelsey's caught. Six. The two tight ends have accounted for over 120 yards. So when you have safeties again that are going to sit back, There's going to be a lot of space. And these tight ends, they're as good as anybody at feeling the space. Noah Gray again learned from the best. And Kelsey, they know where that void is. That time he just sits in it. And Mahomes always going to find you when you sit in that soft spot in that zone. First down, Pacheco is the running back. Isaiah. Nicole. There he goes. Inside the 30. Pushed out of bounds. Inside the 20-yard line. He's back. Yep. Indeed. Yep, and that's the difference with this offense. What blocking in the interior with Tooney and Humphrey and Trey Smith climbing up to that next level. Watch the three here be able to get these blocks and how different that is when you can get a hat on a hat and then you have ten back there. Nothing against Kareem Hunt, but he is more of a thumper. This guy brings that explosive nature to this offense and complements everything that Mahomes in his passing game can do. 34 yards. It's 34 of their 44 total in the game to this point. Again, Pacheco. That broken fibula week two. Been on the men. Couldn't wait to get back. And here he is. I don't know if he's on a pitch count or what it might be. Going to ease him back in. He has such an important part of this offense in their stretch run the rest of December into January. They're going to make a run. They need him healthy. Another late round find. Pacheco's seventh round pick out of Rutgers in 22. Second and nine. Mahomes flag. Drops the ball and secures it back at the 35-yard line. Chased by Crosby. Let's see about the call here. Going to go against Kansas City. legal formation offense number 74 was in the backfield penalties declined third down decline of course because it's a 21 yard loss this gets called on Taylor as much as anybody in the NFL I mean you could call it the Taylor rule the right tackle who's setting up a little bit too deep because of Crosby the respect he has for Crosby as a pass rusher how quick is he by the way this is the look you see it called all over the NFL it's been emphasized more this year If you're wondering why it's an illegal formation, it's because that tackle is off the line of scrimmage that far. And that's where you've got to be for it to be a legal formation. You mentioned Taylor here. Well, never mind. Third and 30. Pass is caught along the sideline. And inside the 25 goes DeAndre Hopkins. So in comes the field goal unit. And that goes back to Andrew Reed's comments to Kaylee about how we digging ourselves holes whether it sacks or penalties That about the one area that been able to slow this Chiefs offense down is just getting themselves way behind the sticks So to the 42-yard line, to the 32-yard line, a 42-yard attempt here for the just-signed Matthew Wright again. Butker out. Schrader kicked last week. He got hurt. He's up. Wright comes off the street, and Wright puts it through. 42-yard field goal with 8.40 to go in the third quarter, and Kansas City is now up 13-3 on Black Friday. Have you played? I have. I was part of that game. I know, but I'm saying, have you ever had to stick? Have you ever played the game? I know you were part of it. Yeah, I was very bad, too, as you can well imagine. up to the 30 on the run back DJ Turner right in front of that Raider bench I don't know if John was a good player of his own game back in the day good question I'd love to know if he ever got a chance to play we got a man down here it's Turner DJ Turner is down just maybe working another yard or two deeper on that route. He got pushed to the inside against Jack Jones who got a little bit physical with him. And Mahomes doesn't miss very often. You just wonder with that chemistry that they're continuing to work on, if that's an example of Ordey trying to work back outside another couple yards downfield. Third and 15, and again you've got moving up front. Offense number 64. Five yard penalty. Third down. That's Wanya Morris. He's the left tackle. They've had a problem on the left side of the line this year. One of the reasons they went out and went to Arizona and got their maybe future left tackle. Yeah, we'll see with D.J. Humphreys. Hopefully once he gets healthy, he'll be able to go. Wanya Morris, there he is right there. Wanya Morris, I think on third down, because of what you mentioned, they've had some issues protecting on that outside. He's just probably trying to get a bit of a head start there. And that time just got out a little bit early. It's the third and 20. The home is flushed out. Ever dangerous. Fires. And along the sideline, intended for Watson. But incomplete. Out of bounds. Fourth down. Now, what do you do? You've got a brand-new cooker. You've got Wright coming in. I think they're going to punt him and try to pin him back. They will. You know, if Butker was out here, Now you're talking to 55 Yeah, that's Everything's in his range Matt, Ariza will do the Kicking Try to pin him deep Nose down Backspin on the ball Fair catch goal for him Made at the 8 yard line by DJ Turner 223 Left in for the ultimate cat and mouse, as you see, Prime Thriller, James Patterson's Detective Alex Cross. Like you've never seen it before, the new series, Cross, now streaming only, only on Prime Video. Beautiful. There you go. Great time during the holidays. Yeah. When you're not watching football, right? Probably football's all the time. 24-7. From the 8-yard line, the Raiders are running their sixth play. Kansas City's already run 21. Start on the ground here. And Abdullah picks up the cover. Remember, this is the team that had Josh Jacobs and let him go. How's he doing? Doing pretty well. Doing pretty well. It's funny. To me, it wasn't a line in the quarterback. Especially in a game like this. Minus your top two guys. Pass is caught. Nice move there. Jacoby Myers. We've been with New England for a number of seasons. A lot of success there. First down. This guy, he is just an undrafted rookie free agent with the Patriots. Hangs there for a few years. Now gets an opportunity in Las Vegas. Good job of possessing that ball first. And then just getting north and south. When you're buried deep inside your own territory, you're just trying to get that first down. Get away from your own goal line. Good throw. Good job of getting that catch. And then getting the yards after the catch to be able to get that first. That's Chris Jones out on the sideline needing some helmet adjustment. Again, working his way. Nice little move there by Abdullah. I think of a third. I'm sure Justin Reed comes up to make the tackle. And you've got to really admire what they're doing. They're going to stick with this running game. Again, dead last in the NFL in rushing. But I think some of that is the style of runs that they had early in the year. Scott Turner and his dad, Norm, they're trying to get more downhill. North and south. Get the line to get a hat on a hat. And just get your three or four or five yards. That's a positive game there on first and ten running the football. Nice little father and son combination for the homie. Cool story. Second and four from the 27-yard line. Keep it on the ground. Looking for room. Nothing there. Stop. Third down. Abdullah stopped by McDuffie. And that should take us to the end of the first quarter. On this Black Friday, meanwhile, Nick Bolton is down. One of the defensive stalwarts for the Kansas City Chiefs. So they will take a look at him as the first quarter comes to an end with the score. Kansas City. Well, Antonio, Mahomes has already found Kelsey four times. What's your strategy to limit that combination? Well, one, we've got to win our leverage, do our job. We're doubling and playing man coverage. The problem is, you know, there's really good players, so we've got to do a better job. And your offense has only had the ball for nine plays. How do you want to attack the Chiefs defense? Yeah, no, we've got to keep moving the change. We have a great opportunity here after the catch. Cut one throw to Kelsey, yards after the catch. Come back the very next play, get it to Juju Smith-Schuster. Again, quick little throw underneath, yards after the catch for a first down. This is who they are. This is the Chiefs of these last couple years. Already six first downs in the first ten minutes of the game. Kareem Hunt, short game here, second and long. And what that does is it puts even more on the shoulders of the quarterback because you've got to be able to be consistent with that patient approach. You're going to move the ball down the field, and then it all comes down to what will you do in the red zone when it comes to execution. First time they got down there, they had to settle for a field goal, so that was really a Raiders win. on that opening drive, even though they allowed him to have the ball for 14 plays. Kelsey in the right slot. Mahomes checks it down to number one, and the number one pick, and the flag is down. That's Xavier Worthy right out in front of that Raider bench. A little bit of taunting there, but the flag thrown as he was on his way to what would have been a first down. Holding defense That penalty's declined Result of the play is the first down Talking to Marvin Lewis, you and I pre-game And one of the things he was telling us Who knows defense better than Marvin Lewis I said, how do you slow Kelsey down? He said, one of the things is you've got to get hands on him Well, there's too many hands That's a hold But gives you an idea of what they want to do Try to reroute him at the line of scrimmage Try to jam him to slow him down Put Noah Gray in at fullback. Mahomes, straight drop, throws. Here's Kelsey again. And again, another flag for the moment. Takes the ball to the 39-yard line, but... Penalties against Kansas City. Holding. Offense number 65. Ten-yard penalty. Three-play the down. Trey Smith, you saw Martin looking over to the bench to see what Pierce wanted to do with the call. What a matchup with Crosby. Usually you're used to seeing him on Taylor, the tackle, but Smith kicks out. That is a battle between these two, and eventually he gets outside of him, and Smith goes down, grabs a hold of him, and brings him down. Crosby, he makes you play all day every play, doesn't he? Yep. Never comes off the field. Hates to. First and 20. Mahomes over the middle. Caught. Who else? Kelsey. In his 12th year in the league, it's amazing how open he keeps getting. Game after game. but out Jenkins the big interior nose guard actually works his way around to get into the pocket and watch how Mahomes just patiently waits for Kelsey knows he's got separation right there able to block out that 320 pounder that's zeroing in on him and puts it in front of him where he can make a play again after the catch beautiful chemistry there between Mahomes and Kelsey 24 yards and you got the penalty here coming up against Kansas City for the full start so three minutes to go in the quarter Kansas City has dominated the quarter told you that Taylor Swift per usual is here Watson Herman already off to a great start with four catches on five targets for 56 yards you said you bumped into him on the field he was a game right? had the hair going Look at the haircut, too. The haircut? That's great. Said he looked even younger. At a double take. I said, wait a second. You haven't seen him five years younger. First and 15. Holmes. All the way to the end zone and incomplete. That time intended for Noah Gray. Talking about him, the other tight end. You know, Kirk, I'm thinking back to using the two tight ends. It reminds me when Bill Belichick had Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez. And he kind of changed everything. Ran the offense through those two guys about a decade ago. And with the way Gray's coming on, you're right. I mean, as good as these receivers are becoming around him, Worthy's coming on, Hopkins comes over in the trade, Juju Smith-Schuster, we know what he can do. But with the way Noah Gray's looks, especially these last couple weeks, it's another great option for them. And you could put Gray in the backfield. You mentioned already he lined up in fullback. Four touchdowns in the last two games. Mahomes protected well again. A little too high intended there for Xavier Worthy. to the third and 15 with two and a half to go in the quarter. Now this is a little example. It reminds me of where Rasheed Rice was a year ago as a rookie coming out of SMU. This could be a little thing like he works inside, he's got man coverage. As we begin week 13 of the National Football League season, which actually started last night and yesterday afternoon with three games, and away we go with game number four of this week. Carlson to kick off for Las Vegas They won the toss And they have deferred Want to reset the play clock And as they say, a very light breeze But enough to blow the ball off the tee to get started McCole Hartman and Somaji P. Ryan are back to receive for Kansas City Carlson gets a 10 yard running start and sends the ball to the corner of the end zone will be taken back from the goal line by P. Ryan and he works his way up to the 28 yard line so they defer which means they face Patrick Mahomes right off the bat Patrick has had better seasons he's the first to say it but when we talked to him the other day, he said, hey, just finding a way to win. And that indeed he's done. He's been much better over the last few games than he was early on. Kareem Hunt gets the start in the backfield. Isaiah Pacheco, though, is active and we'll see a lot of him before the day is done. And they start with Hunt and he goes nowhere. So right off the bat, the Raiders are equal to that pass. It'll be second down. Adam Butler in on the stop. Yeah, a big focus for anybody going up against Patrick Mahomes is trying to negate this run game, try to get him behind the sticks. The Chiefs lead the NFL in third down efficiency. So you want to try to get him behind the sticks. Good start there. Stopping that run game and hunt here early. And he was hot. Find out, find out, find out, find out. On time. Winner. His first pass of the game. Open. Making that catch. It's Xavier Worthy. Working out of Texas. their first round draft choice. So Worthy is good there for a first down at the 40-yard line. Condensed formation gives him plenty of room to work to the outside. Raiders drop back in soft coverage. And, of course, Patrick Mahomes, as good as there is at seeing that pre- to post-snap movement, able to get the rookie involved early here with a nice completion. Being a 14, deep drop, good protection, going deep downfield, and a little too deep. For Justin Watson. They have a plethora of wide receivers, even minus Hollywood Brown and even minus Rasheed Rice, who got hurt early on, worthy, the number one pick. You've got Watson, you've got Juju Smith-Schuster, and they picked up DeAndre Hopkins. Yeah, and a good job there. Antonio Pierce decides to play some man coverage there on first and ten. Not used to seeing that. Patrick Holmes used to seeing a lot of shell coverage, meaning a lot of cover, too. trying to keep the ball in front of him. Keep it on the ground over the left side. Working his way for a game of four is Kareem Hunt up to the 44-yard line. Picked up Hunt, who'd been with Cleveland over the past five years when Pacheco got hurt. Now Pacheco is back today, and we'll get an opportunity to see him for the first time in two months. It's a very different offense without what he brings, that explosive nature of his running game and what he can do. and I think it electrifies the offense. We'll eventually get a look at him. These guys, again, lead the entire NFL in third down efficiency. See how they do here. Here they are on a third down and eight. Mahomes stepping up. Under pressure. Throws under pressure. Completes it. Travis Kelsey to the 45-yard line. He goes, but there's a flag down. A lot of action up front at the inception. Yeah, he had a free play there. Chazon jumped off to his left. He actually looked over his shoulder to see him, recognized that he had that free play, and then dials up his main target for the first down. Lee Martin, our referee today. Watch Kelsey's route. I mean, this is vintage Mahomes and Kelsey. See, he said, by the way, he jumped there. Now he's just playing backyard football. I mean, that's not even a route. That's just kind of feeling where the opening space is in him and Mahomes being on target. Now Pacheco and the crowd responding gave him a great ovation when he was introduced before the game. And you can hear the cheers resounding for the return of number 10. He brings such energy. And you can feel it. Not just the crowd. He's going to check out. Not just the crowd. More importantly, on the field. Teams, again, they play a lot of coverage, meaning they want to keep everything in front of the defense. They don't want to give Mahomes a chance to let him easily. Tackled there by Joshua Williams. First down Raiders. This kid's a freak. By the way, this is what he looked like as a true freshman when he showed up at Georgia. And this is a lot of the plays that he ran. I mean, he would run that jet sweep. Usually that's a receiver play. But this guy at 6'4", 235 pounds, he's athletic, he's explosive, he's aggressive, goes airborne. Josh Williams, wondering where he went. Went up and over for the first down. Raiders have outgained the Chiefs by 22 yards to this point. McCormick. Sincere McCormick to the 37-yard line. Rookie free agent. I like the look of this guy. He just shook off Nick Bolton. You're talking about who's back in the lineup. You're talking about one of the better middle linebackers in the NFL. And here's a guy that's just trying to make a name for himself. Just trying to get any carries at all. You mentioned him. He's a practice squad guy, essentially, throughout his last couple years. Last week he gets brought up, five carries, 33 yards, raised enough eyebrows that they're determined to get his hands on the football again today. Any running back in a storm for these guys right now. Big to him, look out, pressure. That's to dump it away. That time Karloftis came flying through. Jones is trying to plead the case that it should be grounding. For the moment, there's no flag, but there is a conversation. Yeah, I think there's a tight end. Michael Meyer was right there where he threw the ball. He kind of flipped it to him, but he was right there. There's a tight end right here, Michael Meyer. He's blocking. Looks like a lineman, but he throws it right at his feet. Ineligible player downfield. That's a different story. Office number 56. They're setting up a screen, and those linemen are getting downfield. Karloftis does a good job of being able to apply that pressure. The screen never had much of a chance. It was on the right guard, Parham. These guys are just trying to run a screen. They're not expecting that pressure to get to the quarterback that quickly. They, of course, have no idea. They're running the play call. giving an asterisk and a mark there to Karoftis for causing that. So second down and eight after the penalty. On the ground again. 38-yard line. Nick Bolton makes the tackle on McCormick. Third down. And a big part of running the football is not just, hey, we want to take the pressure off of our protection and our offensive line. It's keeping him on the sideline. I mean, this is, again, they're dead last in the NFL in running the football. And with a new coordinator, they're trying to run downhill. They're not trying to run wide outside zone. They're trying to run north and south downhill. And it's been effective enough. And, again, more importantly, here they are third and four. Team averaging only 75 yards per game. They have 29 on eight carries. McConnell hanging in the pocket. Fires over the middle. Nearly picked off. Nick Bolton was right there at the 30 to break it up. Fourth down. We just talked about Bolton. This is fantastic. One of the more intelligent middle linebackers. Watch his head the entire time with these crossers. Mesh route. He's looking left. He's looking right. Everything's in front of him. Instill the awareness to read the quarterback's eyes and get airborne to knock that football away. Otherwise, that's a first down. That's a big-time play by Bolton. 56 yards for Carlson. A.J. Cole to spot it. And Carlson, one of the best in the league. No good. Short. So Kansas City will take over near midfield. 5.55 to the half, 3-3. That building for the Raiders, and he works on his body, works on his game year-round. Look at the sacks, second most from that 2019 draft class. The defensive snaps, never comes off the field. Meanwhile, that defense now from Kansas City starting at the 47. Three, wide open, Noah Gray to the 25-yard line. And he goes, tackled there by Spillane. So we're talking about Gray. You know, you talk about a marriage made in heaven. He and Andy Reid and the way this organization is run doesn't get any better. No. So Carson ready to kick off. Game tied 3-3. Four minutes into the second quarter. Hardman and Pirine are back for Kansas City. from the one. Hardman. Up to the 23-yard line. You know, when a guy is that good, I mean, you know, fans go, oh, you know, the announcers are going to get past the 50. But with the other guy kicking last week, I had to get deeper into Carolina territory. Meanwhile, stuffed in the backfield here Is Max Crosby taking a hold of Isaiah Pacheco? I think it's the humility, the passion, the competitive spirit, and he and Andy Reid just being connected in a way where they're continuing to just, yeah, they have a system, but it just feels like they're constantly tweaking, constantly coming up with a new wrinkle. It makes it more fun, I think, for the offense around him. I just think the humility, though, how he gets a new player in, wants to work with him, wants to get better. And like all the great ones, that competitive fire is what separates him from the rest. Second and 15, checks it down here, catches me. Short game for Pacheco. Third down. This Raiders defense, as we're talking about a lot of different things, this is about exactly how Antonio Pierce envisioned it. This is what he talked about. This is what he thought about. We talked about in the open, how do they hang around? Do they got to come in with an attitude? They've got to come in with a belief, and they've got to get Mahomes behind the sticks, and they've done that, and they've done a great job. Even when they have given up some yards, they've done their job in the red zone. Third and ten here. Mahomes is going to get sacked at the 15-yard line. When you talked about it, you win on defense. That time, it's to leave on Jason. You know, you're talking about last year, how'd they win the game? and they won the game with two defensive touchdowns. That's exactly right, and we keep talking about it. This is the issue for the Chiefs, not just today, but all year. Chason with great hands there. He uses hands to just get away from the tackle. Morris, who continues to struggle on that blind side. Look how quick he got off of the left tackle and around him, and Mahomes never had a chance to get away from that pressure. So the Chiefs forced the putt. 36-yard line, DJ Turner coming to the near side, trying to get around the corner. He gets popped at the 45. So 3-3 with 8.55 left to go in. He is looking forward to a brown bag with that hoodie inside after this game. That would motivate me. No doubt. heard all week about how many great meals she can make. We have to set up a little bit of free time next time we do the Chiefs. A thousand percent. I'm all in. How about the job Ava Connell has done? Raiders are not, they've got three points, but from where this offense has been, in this environment... Brack should come up here, it's going to be no issue. That's only a second in completion. Trying to hit Bowers there. Second and ten. He's right now, as you look at O'Connell, 7-9 to 99 yards. He had the thumb that took him out after week seven. Minshew back in. But just watching him in pregame, watching him here, I don't even think it's on his mind. I think he's playing with confidence. I think he's focused in on the Chiefs and the coverage and distributing this football. Into the backfield comes one sincere McCormick. rookie out of Texas, San Antonio. O'Connell, chase, look out from behind. Gets it away, coming back to make the grab here is Brock Bowers. So he comes back. Meanwhile, Justin Reed was chasing O'Connell, got it away, and picks up a few yards here. Yeah, they blitzed from his blind side, and now you've got a matchup that you like to see. The problem is there was so much pressure, he couldn't get much on it. So it brought the rookie back. But a great adjustment by Bowers to get back to that football. And now they've got a shot here on third and very short. Gain a nine there, third down and one. On the Chiefs' side of the 50. Going to hand it, coming around from the side. That time is Bowers at him in motion. And timeout taken here. Just because, you know, people get analytics and the numbers and the stats. It's like, you know, you think about this team. You said they're dead last in the NFL. You have to run the football. Well, Holmes has 10 yards rushing. It's the fewest yards rushing in his era. Back at 30. KC on top, third down and nine now. Abdullah in the backfield. Myers sets up in the slot to the left side. Plenty of time on the play clock. Under heat. Down he goes. Chris Jones. He hasn't had a sack in two months with two today. I always find it interesting we talk with Chris Jones. Such an interesting guy to talk to. And he always tells us, you know, on third down, me and Scott, how about that kid off? He goes, I try to almost find the victim. Like, who am I feeling? Who, based on my film study, who do I want? want to go after on third down. Here he goes after the rookie, the right tackle, D.J. Glaze. Gets him off balance, gets him leaning, and wins off that right edge. And again, the quarterback that time, I think he's surprised by how quickly Big 95 got to him. And the snap didn't help either. Off to the right. Cole could punt. Hardman sets up at his own 10. Angled kick towards the near side and go out of bounds. And they will mark that one somewhere around the 16-yard line or the 15-yard line. And a flag is down on the play as well. Gunner ran out of bounds. player out of bounds on a kick Las Vegas number 34 Kansas City will tackle in the five yard penalty to the end of the play it's first down timeout alright so exactly one minute to go from the home he's got that much time 10-3 Bay, 9-3 against the Lions, 11-1. Kickoff at 8-15 Eastern time next week on Thursday night football. As good as it gets. Yeah, that's a great one. Can't wait. Both those teams yesterday dominant. So coming up in six nights, as we start, that would be week 14. Meanwhile, Mahomes, with a minute to go, gets smothered here. Some pressure put on. They brought everybody that time Roll the dice on first and ten I think they're a little bit frustrated That last drive seeing Mahomes had so much time To throw the football This time they dial it up Get to him, get him behind the sticks And I think they're going to be comfortable Just working this after that play They're comfortable just killing the clock here Second and 15, yeah they're going to have one time out They're in no hurry here Mahomes A little shoulder shake. And the pass wide open. Hopkins to the 50-yard line. And now they'll take their time out. I was a little surprised because, I mean, this team, it doesn't matter where they are. I mean, whatever and whatever in terms of down and distance. Let the clock run, but now they stop it with 18. Just a slow reaction. You won't see it here, but it's just a slow reaction from the safety. He needs to be coming over there to help Jack Jones out. Now you see him 20, but Jones jumps on it. Look at the top. See that big hole there between the corner and the safety? The safety's so slow in getting over. I think his eyes were in the backfield just kind of staring at Mahomes and waiting to make a decision. But he waits until the ball's in the air, and by then it's just too late. Yeah, there's Wright, who was picked up off the street last week. You got one timeout. You got a first down at the 50. You got Gray coming in motion to the inside. Mahomes with a deep drop, surveying. It fires over the middle, and that's caught at the 40-yard line by Noah Gray. Now they've got to get up there. In a hurry because, me wondering, you've got a penalty here. What do you got here? Max Crosby just got a night. You talk about what he has to deal with. Triple team on that play. Well, she got a whistle. You got no timeouts. They couldn't have taken a timeout. We've got a conversation going on here. Be quiet. Tell us. Be quiet. It's great. Hush. All right, you tell me. Terry is looking on from Stanford quizzically. Well, you had two different calls. One guy's saying incomplete. The other guy's saying catch. Okay, here we go. After review, after an expedited review, it was a catch. He was down by contact with 14 seconds. By rule, this does require a 10-second runoff. Please set the game clock to four seconds. Four seconds on the game clock, please. Four seconds. if that's an expedited review I'm an astronaut well replay came in and reversed that to be able to make that a catch for the cheese mom's just going to kill the clock here and then set up a field goal attempt crowd has befuddled as well Well, it reverses it to a running clock. And that's why the 10-second runoff. So now you've got a 59-yard field goal. Welcome in, kid. Here you go. Here you go, Matthew Wright. Who's been around for six years. He has signed on practice squads or rosters 15 different times. And this kick is short. It's going to be run back from the end zone, but not very far. Well, that is the way the half ends. Crowd didn't like the way it ended. But per usual, they have the lead. 10-3. Kelsey, big half, catches 63 yards. Mahomes with 15 192 We go to Kaylee Well Coach you got some points on the board and you moved the ball but where do you want to see your offense improve in the second half We can take the steps backwards You know, with the penalties, we've got to take care of that. We're going to be okay, so we had a couple sacks in there. We've got to take care of that part offensively. Defensively, we've just got to keep going, man. Get the run game shut down here a little bit and roll. Thanks, Coach. Okay. There we go. Coming up after the break. Myers has caught five and Bowers has caught the other three kick will come down to the three yard line and Turner stepped in front of his mate back there and gets spilled up at the 20. Well I think the one question we came in this week was Aiden O'Connell coming off that thumb surgery on his throwing hand how would it hold up and I don't think there's been an issue at all I mean the ball has come out clean the biggest issue is being able to slow down Chris Jones, but that right thumb looks good. The ball has come out really, really strong, and I don't think the ball slipped out of there. I don't think he's had any issues with his grip. Again, I think right now he's focused on trying to slow down that pass rush and continue to give him time to be able to make throws and find Myers and Brock Bowers. From the 25 on this cloudless 37-degree afternoon, play action, good protection. Pass is incomplete. Turner in the area had Myers cutting across second down to 10. Should mention it, if you're a Chiefs fan, Nazzy Johnson, 13, who's been out there playing a lot this year. He got beat early in this game. Spagg's just trying to figure out the back end. They still have Jalen Watson out with an injury, hope to get him back maybe into postseason. And they put Joshua Williams, too, in for Nazzy Johnson. And so he's been in the majority of the game. You can see, 13, he's healthy. But he is, for now, on the bench and has been for most of this game. Second and ten little toss back here on the ground. And picking up a first down again of 11 is Abdullah. So, again, the team that is worst in the league in rushing, just about with their per-game average already right now. Yeah, they are mixing up their looks. Antonio Pierce has to be very proud of what Scott Turner and Norv Turner are doing. A lot of interior run. This time they get Abdullah outside where he's got some quickness and good blocking that time on the edge to get him downhill. Watch it. 3.18. Trying to get up. His numbers under that one touchdown pass came against the Chiefs, so they work on him. With eight and a half to go on the third. Yeah, he's going to get up. He's right there on his own sideline. Yeah, that ball came out. right there just before he even got contact. You can see it was a little bit, just didn't, that left leg looked like it had an issue. Hopefully he's going to be all right there. But one thing about the football coming out, you know, this team is minus 17 in turnover margin, dead last in the league. I don't mean to jinx them. They've done a better job today. They're taking care of the ball. so he's replaced by Terrace Marshall just got activated and that pass is put and taken to the 40 yard line there by Brock Bowers one of the guys we've been watching a lot is Chris Jones let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS in the interior when it comes to rushing to quarterback he's been double teamed really taken out of the game and neutralized so he's decided to get out on the edge and when he has been out there three times he's rushed to quarterback and he's been able to come away with two big sacks for this Chiefs defense. Looking like Chris Jones as a game wrecker. Last play, gaining 11 to the 41. Josh back here. Nick Bolton making the tackle. You're going to love this, Al. First he's got to be able to outrun the center, the rookie who's trying to climb up to get to him. Watch how he gets away from the center. Does that. Now he's going to take on the puller, pushes him back, and then makes the tackle right at the line of scrimmage. So both rookies learned a lesson there against one of the more seasoned veteran middle linebackers. The center trying to climb to him, and then that right tackle just could not handle his power when he came through there on that pull. Second and nine. Flip it back here and buried. McCormick taken down and then jawing along the way. At least the last play, they tried to block him. And this time, they didn't block him. The last time they had two guys on him, this time, nobody. So you set the edge with Williams, and then you let the big fella 32, Bolton, clean it up. Back-to-back plays by the middle linebacker, the leader of this defense. Third and ten. Jones up here on that edge again. Three receivers. Set to the right, and that pass is incomplete, but there's a flag. It looked like Kansas City was offside. It was Jones. Offside. Defense number 95. Indeed. High yard penalty. It's third down. All right, so third down and five now. Trying to use that wisdom of a veteran, just trying to guess that snap count, and misses it just by about a half a beat. So third and ten, to now third and five for O'Donnell. Or O'Connell, rather. Six and a half to go in the third. Ten-point game. Going deep. And Kenny one-handed. With a flag thrown at the end of the play. Brock Bowers pulling it in. I mean, the one-handed catch has become like every week, every game. Watch at the end of this out. It almost looks like he's trying to catch an egg. Everybody's throwing eggs back and forth to each other. He just kind of soft, just kind of takes the air off of the ball and just brings it in. And it does get the left hand in there to be able to help him out. Remember, this guy's a tight end. A tight end with the skill set of a wide receiver to flex him out. That's third down and five. You get it matched up out there against the corner, and you take that shot. Good job of recognizing the matchup, and he hits it. 29 yards. In business at the 25-yard line. Sliding left. Throwing in that direction incomplete. Coverage is good right there. You got Justin Reed taking care of Brock Bowers. It'll be second down and 10. Justin Reed knocked Jacoby Myers out. I mean, I don't know if you'll be able to see it, but watch 16 here on his route. He ends up getting flattened right there. And now look at Reed in coverage on Bowers. I mean, what a job there by the veteran. Takes one guy out by just throwing that shoulder and then gets out into coverage and takes the rookie out. Two for one there for the safety. Double duty for him. Reed, seventh year in the league. Came over a couple of years ago from the Texans. Turn of the man in motion. Coming back the other way. He takes the pass. Down the sideline he goes. into Kansas City territory. All the way to the 39-yard line goes D.J. Turner. This is all on the quarterback because he saw that Spags loves to overload and bring extra pressure. Once you recognize it, just get the ball out. Does a good job. There's a free man. He's got to account for him. Get the ball out to the outside to Turner. And now it's just one-on-one out there. Make one man miss, and there's no one left. Great job there by Aiden O'Connell, recognizing the pressure. and getting the ball out quickly to Turner. 25 yards for a guy who scored a touchdown in the 27-20 loss back in Vegas earlier this season. Keeping on the ground, spinning around. Abdur picks up about four. Nick Bolton in on the stop. Think about playing in this division in the AFC West. We've got Herbert with the Chargers, obviously Mahomes. What Bo Nix is doing right now as a rookie with Sean Payton, And, I mean, if you're going to compete in this division, and everybody needs a quarterback, and you turn on these games in the NFL, you can see right away who has a chance and who doesn't. If you don't have a quarterback, you got no shot. Aiden O'Connell just gives this offense, in my opinion, a different feel with him out there in command. Yeah, it was a walk on at Purdue and wind up spending six years in West Lafayette. Has time, goes deep, and it's incomplete. A lot of red shirts around number 16, Jacoby Myers. Third down. What a play. We just talked about how Joshua Williams is in for Nazi Johnson. Myers works over from the left all the way across, but the guy who ends up separating him is the corner. Right there, two. Came out of nowhere. See right here? He's in position playing match coverage. He gives up on one receiver who leaves his area and then finds Jacoby Myers coming over from the other side. Really good vision that time by Joshua Williams. Third down five. Run it. And pick up the first. Abdullah. What a call. What a call. Jordan Meredith, Colton Miller, the left side. They got a double team. I don't think the Chiefs were expecting this at all. The only guy there is the middle linebacker, Nick Bolton. Watch the left side, 74-61. They get Bolton right there. That's really the main block they had to make. Once they secured the linebacker, you see they double teamed him. That's just, that's a heck of a call. They come up short. I thought they picked that up easily. Yeah, I did too. And look, you see Pierce going, oh, come on, man. He got it. But now it's fourth down. Fourth and one. And, and, and no. Bolton is there. So after all that, I'm just wondering if that was close enough to call for a challenge. The first one. I thought at the very least they would take a look at that. Antonio Pierce had that look of anguish. Like you said, you've got to be kidding me. and then you get into an obvious short yardage situation with Chris Jones and company in there. Turn it over on downs. With the naked eye, it looked like the first down was secured. They were all over it with the knee. Yeah, the knee comes down here, and there's the knee down, and there's the ball, which is clearly about a half yard shy. Put him on a 30-yard line for his fourth down play. Watch the interior by Nottie and Chris Jones, 95. They eat all the linemen, and they free up Nick Bolton to be able to make that play where he submarines the back. Chiefs now start from the 30-yard line. And Mahomes with outstanding protection. The pass is incomplete. Kelsey was the intended receiver over the middle. Second down at 10. First time we've seen Mahomes and Kelsey not quite enough. That's going to be caught and taken down at the 40-yard line. Jacoby Myers makes the grab. 45, 44, 43. Getting up to the line. Look at the poise of O'Connell here. Not panicking at all. Got it set. Get the play call. Get ready to go. Need the field goal. First down, 34, 33. Pass is caught. Can he get outside? He's inbounds. It's Abdullah. But they're clearly now in field goal range. 24, 23, 22. This is textbook. Fire this into the ground and kill the clock. This is about as good as he could go. For Aiden O'Connell and the Raiders. With 15 seconds. So Carlson getting loose on the sideline. He made one from 27. He's missed from 56, 55, 58. The 56 was short. The other two were ugly. Mahomes just wanting to get his hands on the ball, wanting a chance. But I don't think it's going to happen. It's going to come down to this drive. Cannot say enough about Aiden O'Connell. Guy has not played football with a broken thumb. has no chance other than to work his mind to stay sharp in this game and flawlessly moves his offense into field goal range. It would be a 50-yard field goal from here. Drops it. Flag is strong, though. Flag will stop it. Four seconds went off the clock, but what is the call? The center just, he's a rookie. He snapped the football. I don't know what he thought he heard. The Raiders weren't even lined up. It's got to be on the Raiders for not even having a chance to get lined up. This crowd couldn't hurt anything. Jackson Powers Johnson is the center. I'm not sure. Yeah, the Raiders didn't have a chance to get set. The ball is snapped. It was a second and three. Remember, the clock had stopped by firing it, so there will not be a ten-second runoff. I'm not sure Jackson Powers-Johnson, what made him think to snap that ball, just bounced off the chest of O'Connell. A legal shift on the offense. That penalty's declined. The Chiefs did recover the backwards pass and take over first half. Oh, on top of it. Wow. Wow. But just talking about the command that Aiden O'Connell had, and he did. This is not on O'Connell. I don't mean to put it all on Jackson Powers Johnson. Something made him want to snap this football. O'Connell's not expecting it. He's surveying the defense. There's the ball. It snapped. The rest of the offensive line surprised as much as anybody. And there's Bolton jumping on top of it. And the play. Play alive. This is going to clinch a playoff spot for the Chiefs. It's the first turnover of the game for either team. Meanwhile, the teams are still out there because the Chiefs, if they're bold, they're going to have to run. Meanwhile, the conversation continues. You see that right guard tap. Barnum tapped the center. Jackson Powers Johnson, usually when you're on the road with silent count, that's to let the center know we're good and we're ready to go. But the quarterback had not notified the offensive line that he was ready. Just not on the same page. I mean we saw the debacle yesterday with the Bears and Caleb Williams and Eberflus the end of the game disaster and as good as that looks ends in a disaster here as well in Kansas City for the Raiders once again for the Kansas City Chiefs they take it right down to the nub you know they don't rank you on style points they're not blowing teams out people think they're more vulnerable than ever you tell me All I know is they're 11-1. Taylor Swift coming in for Thanksgiving. Her man, her team, they do it again. Give Pierce a ton of credit. He brought this. He almost gets sacked here again. That pass is incomplete. Pressure once more put on. Third down and eight with 6-0-8 left in the fourth. What a night again for Chase Hahn. It's not necessarily the speed. This time he pushes the guard, Tooney, who's playing left tackle, back into the quarterback with power. So he's shown us what he can do by using speed to get around. At the time, Morris, and now the guard's out there tuning, and this time he just pushes him back, and that can affect, again, the quarterback. You can see Mahomes not comfortable in that pocket with that pressure. Third down and eight. Mahomes dumps it off. DeRine tackled at the 32. So they hold, and they're going to get the ball back. Down by two. They're able to rush four plays zone. That's why you saw those white jerseys after he checked it down to Purine. And it's a beautiful thing when you can pressure with four. Eyes on the quarterback. They check it down. And three or four different white jerseys are able to run to the football there. Get the ball back to O'Connell. Still a football game here with 5.30 to go. That arises to punt. his fourth of the night. Amir Abdullah back in his own 15-yard line. Sky-high kick. Fielded by Abdullah. From the 14. Up to the 33. With 5.15 to play in the fourth, we are back in 30 seconds. One by two. Video board imploring the crowd to get loud. You get as loud as any stadium in the league when they do get loud. Decimal level right now into triple digits. And the Raiders going into the noise. And against that defense from their own 32-yard line down by two. Start with a run. Nice run. Sincere McCormick. 11 carries, 65 yards. And this team, last in the league in rushing, has gained 117 on the ground. In this offensive line, D.J. Clay is the right tackle. The rookie out of Maryland is kind of growing up right before our eyes. That time, a great block on Karloftis. Watch him on the right, 71. Kind of seal him to the inside. Gets him turned. Pushes him. great job of sustaining that block and giving it back that time McCormick some room to run but through can he get the first down yes he can McCormick tackled him McDuffie so the game which started in bright sunshine right now lights full effect Clock ticking down to the four-minute mark. Antonio Pierce has had to turn to a running back off the practice squad, and he is delivered along with Amir Abdullah with Alexander Madison's, Amir White out their top two backs. He's impressive. The offensive line's been impressive. Extra pressure. Gets it away. Caught. To the 48-yard line goes Bowers. Bowers now in triple digits. It's eight catches from him and 102 yards. Remember, this is a secondary that's still a work in progress, trying to find the right combination of players. They've already benched Nazee Johnson. And Joshua Williams, too, has stepped in for him with Jalen Watson down. This is a defense that's still just kind of fine manner. Last couple games, we saw Bryce Young put up big numbers last week for Carolina. Josh Allen two weeks ago in Buffalo. And tonight, Aiden O'Connell looking pretty good. Lefe, under pressure, steps away, gets it away. It's caught. You've got Bowers again. Picks up the first down, taken out by Nick Fole. you gotta give O'Connell so much credit I mean this guy you know in a perfect scenario this guy as you watch the play again they would have waited maybe another week had Minshew not broken his collarbone last week yeah but you can just sense being around this team this week that's just a check down they lose Bowers he was in blocking and then just slips out great job of seeing him checking it down of all people check it down to Bowers but the kids playing with poise really look at the confidence in his eyes First down. This on the stuffed McCormick at the line of scrimmage. To deliver that touchdown to Watson. Who do you think of when you think of the tongue out? One guy. 23 for the Chicago Bulls. That pass is going down for it. No, it's no good. Xavier Worthy, short hops. Third down and ten. He plays his best in the critical moments, meaning third down, completing 70% of his passes this year with nine touchdowns, only one interception. Fourth quarter, same thing, 70%. So here we are, close to the red zone. And they're going to take a, looks like they're going to take a peek. The statistic crowd is saying it's definitely a catch. Does Worthy get his hands underneath? Yeah, that ball never hit the ground. That's definitely a catch. Replay assistance, we do have a catch on the field at the 17-yard line. 17-yard line. How great is replay assistance? It's good when it works, and it does right here. You have to like when it's expedited, for sure, you know, instead of screwing around for two minutes. Yeah, that was a quick one. And a big difference between third and ten, and now third and two, or third and three. It's the third and three now at the 17. Pacheco is the running back. Stays in the block. Mahomes under pressure. Over shoots his man. He had Kelsey. Again, they brought the house. They keep mixing these looks in. Going cover zero. So, meaning everybody's on an island. You don't have any safety support. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Everybody's picked up. Mahomes has what he wants with Kelsey isolated in a one-on-one matchup. Just not able to hit him here for this touchdown pass against Holmes. Boy, that is a mismatch. But he didn't quite have enough time to deliver. That's a stop-depressing stuff for those two guys. right now with the 35-yard attempt. And down the middle for Hampton. So with 3-11 to play now in the third, Kansas City up 16-3. That is a great one. Green Bay at Detroit next Thursday night on Prime. Hang with us. Meanwhile, Mahomes, take a look at this. A little friendly fire at the end of that last play. Yeah, he was slow to get up, and we went back and looked at it during the break. See right here, one of his linemen, one of the big fellas there. So flexing that non-throwing hand. Goes to the sideline here. Pickoff is a bouncing ball. It's fielded at the six-yard line. by Abdullah. Running his way. And Abdullah will take the ball inside the 30 to the 25-yard line. Amir Abdullah finally chased down by Shamari Connor. So, if ever a good run back was needed, this was the point. Yeah, and really, Amir Abdullah throughout his career, whether it's special teams being a third down back. That's what his calling card has been with the two starting backs out. He's had to be the guy. But look at that move, that initial move to get him started. Then he hits that crease. Great blocking. And then it's a foot race. Eventually, Conner's able to chase him down. But what a big return here for the Raiders. And like you said, Al, at a critical time here to get them back into this game, see if they can take advantage of the opportunity. 69 yards. McCormick is the running back from the 26. The Raiders have had a couple of good drives that have come up empty. Back-to-back. McCormick picks up two. They've had a missed field goal, turnover on downs, and another missed field goal. So plenty of opportunities. They just can't cash in. Let's see what the approach is here with Scott Turner and how they're going to try to come up with a way. They're going to have to make a play through the air. They've got to protect the quarterback, and it's either going to be Bowers or Myers is going to have to win. Whether it's zone, settling in that salt spot, or being able to win in man coverage. McDonald's completed 11 passes. Five to Myers, five to Bowers, one to Turner. Empties the backfield. Go five wide, second and seven. Under pressure. Flag. looking to get out of bounds, and he does just at around the first down mark, it with a flag it's going to be a holding call as it normally is in that situation yep guy begins to roll away flag comes in offense number 74, 10 yard penalty second down, Fulkin Miller the left tackle Amanahu, it's great to see back by the way, we haven't talked much about him tonight, Charles Amanahu had the ACL and the AFC championship game, has worked so hard to come back, applying the pressure this time, and Miller to the inside. You can see that hold there with the right arm up around his neck. Takes it a second and 17. Two minutes left in the third. Stepping up. Go and D has a man. Caught. Into the end zone. Touchdown, Brock Bowers. Well, we've all heard he is something special, and now he's proving it. He sure is. Again, this kid's been like this. He hasn't changed a bit since he was a true freshman. Body size. Remember we talked about disrupting him with the line of scrimmage? They didn't do it here. Connor, who is in his second year out of Virginia Tech, that is a tough matchup for him at his size. Really known more for being in the box, being a physical safety. Here he's getting isolated against the big tight end, one-on-one without much help. And what a job by O'Connell, climbing that pocket to buy time and put the ball right on the money for that touchdown. Carlson for the extra point. A minute 40 to go. A lot of people thought this would be a runaway. When the game ends live, music begins on this Black Friday. Sun going down. Kansas City, Missouri. Temperature is 36 degrees. And a six-point game. To the 30 and to Kaylee. Guys, we didn't see Patrick Mahomes getting any medical attention after he walked off the field scrunching that left fist. As he studied the tablet on the sidelines, He was massaging his own hand. He then stood up, took a couple of practice throws, and as he handled the ball with his left and then threw with the right, he didn't see any irritation, it seemed. And there he is, taking a look at it. Well, take a look, keep a close eye on him from the 30-yard line as he starts this drive with a handoff. And about a four-yard pickup for Kareem Hunt. The Chiefs had that big run by Pacheco for 34 yards, But outside of that, nine carries, 11 yards. So the Raiders have done a pretty good job outside of the big run of containing that run game. And Kelsey also, big first quarter, 56 yards in the first quarter alone. Patrick Graham has done a good job of putting the clamps down. Since that first quarter, only seven yards. But we're getting close to the fourth quarter, which is when Mahomes and Kelsey usually take over. A minute left in this quarter. A little jump pass, but nothing happened in there. Better serve had it been incomplete. Kareem Hunt tackled there by Max Crosby. Lost a six on the play. You saw Patrick Graham, and he keeps dialing up different looks for this offensive line. They keep attacking that left side. Morris is struggling in protection, whether it's just one-on-one or bringing a little bit of pressure off the edge. Merrick that time came off that nickel spot. So it's not just confusing Mahomes. It's confusing the line. Now you've got a third and 11. Waning seconds of the quarter. Deep drop. Under pressure. Avoids the sack. Throws off balance. Dropped. He had it. It was dropped. He had Max Crosby chasing him. Had the first down. Extended the play. Pass was dropped. Dropped by Hopkins. How about Crosby? You're going to love this. Crosby gets to him, works around and pushes around Taylor. Good coverage. How does he look? Look at him. He's climbing around in his ankles, somehow locates Hopkins, and makes this throw right on the money, and he's just not able to hold on to it. So the Raiders get exactly what they had hoped for a three and out. the kick fielded at the 20-yard line Abdullah brings it back to about the 31 with five seconds to play in the quarter the rise of that time with the punt after the drop pass the punt is I was going to say it sure helps to have those confident eyes when you have an offensive line in a running game, something that's been missing for most of the year for the Raiders, where they're a dead last coming into tonight and running the football, but that has not been the story at all. This offensive line has responded to Scott and Norb Turner's system. More downhill inside between the tackles running. It's fit. Seems to suit this offensive line. Second down, 11. Two and a half left. Knocked down, broken up, Carlottis. He's known for that. He's batted down a whole bunch through the years, third and 11. It's just a great athlete making a play. Being able to know he can't get in, but he's anticipating the potential of that throw. That ball is going around him. What an adjustment by 56 to get around his left hand down on that football. 13 batted passes by Carlotta since the end of the league third year knocks one down here big third and 11 pressure again knocked down again Justin Reed comes away with the play fourth and 11 I think they were looking to pick up about seven or eight yards here trying to help get into better field goal range, give Carlson a better shot. They had soft coverage. It's there, trying to throw it to Jacoby Myers on a slant. If that ball's not knocked down, there he is right there. He catches that football, would be short for the first down, but would have obviously gotten into field goal range. No question. So now instead you've got Cole who's out of pen and deep. Again, the Raiders have all of their timeouts. You have the two-minute warning. Timeout. Las Vegas their first. They take it. I don't know why. I don't know why. Kick a field goal here. Maybe so. Okay, but still that's a huge timeout. It is. If you don't score here. In pregame, I was standing right next to him, and he was making him from this distance going in this direction. All right, no win to speak of. This will be a 58-yard attempt. Carlson to try to give him the lead. Paul puts it down. Carlson's kick is up. Uh-uh. No good again. he's now missed three and they give it back to Kansas City minus one timeout that they should have had and a short field I would never sit up here and pretend to know anything about kicking but it did look awkward after the kick the follow through and again when you get a long kick like this you're trying to drive that ball keep it low but the follow through didn't look like his normal follow through and of course the ultimate downside now well the ultimate is not scoring but he gives Mahomes the ball in his own 48 now they can't stop the clock three times twice on timeouts and once at the two minute warning but more importantly they've got to stop Kansas City from getting first downs Pacheco across the 50 They're going to let it get down to the two-minute warning and take their timeouts on the other side Las Vegas Well, now they just decided to call it Let's take another peek at this kick Again, he's got the leg strength to make this if he hits it clean Snaps good, there's the hold good Oh, he hits the ground, see that? That was a great look he hit the ground before he hits the football, loses all the power in that kick. They had time to take a divot. Yeah. I know all about that. You know all about that. Number 76 is an eligible receiver. 76 is eligible. So second down and five. One timeout left. Look at this. 13 straight wins. Crazy. One possession. Go back and include the postseason. Right. Longest in NFL history, the Patriots 0-3 or 4. Including an overtime win in the Super Bowl. All right. Now the ball taken to the 44 by Pacheco. They're going to take their final timeout here. And it becomes compelling to be able to stop them. Timeout. Well. Las Vegas. It's 30 seconds. Why do we love the NFL? I mean, this should be a rout. You've got a 12-point favorite wherever they were coming in. You've got to hand it to the Raiders. Yeah, I mean, we'll see how this game ends up. But I just can't say enough about when you watch these NFL games, you see a team that's 2-9, they've lost seven in a row, quote-unquote nothing to play for, and these dudes played with everything to play for. They put it all out there. To me, that says a lot about Antonio Pierce, this staff, what they're doing, and what they're building. This guy, for sure. There's a lot to build on here. So sometimes we see these reactions, get rid of everything, fire everybody when your record's 2-10 or whatever it is. You've got to peel back the layers here. Look at the injuries. Think about Christian Wilkins on this team all year. Marcus Epps is starting safety. Can the Raiders stop him here? Mahomes going deep. Incomplete. worthy the intended receiver you got Richardson covering on the play and that stops the clock with 203 what a gutsy call here and Mahomes gets hit again as he throws his football by Diablo who's coming on the pressure but it's a gutsy call it's a right call he has him and just not able to be in sync yet with the speedster the fastest guy to ever run at the combine, a 4-2-1. He misses him. They kill the clock. And they're going to punt the ball back to the Raiders. Yeah, you had rookie on rookie there. Richardson, rookie out of Mississippi State covering. Worthy on the play, so they'll get it back. Timeout. Kansas City. Casey takes their first timeout. Andy Reid's looking at that play sheet. It's fourth and two at the 44-yard line. Mahomes coming over to talk to him. There's Matt Nagy. He's got his helmet on. A lot of confidence in Mahomes, obviously. A lot of confidence in his own defense. What an interesting call here. A fascinating call. But, you know, the complete downside, obviously, is Vegas would only need a field goal to win the game. If you don't make it, you give them the ball at midfield, so they're going to leave the punt group out there right now. Abdullah back inside is 10. Reads it to send it down in his direction. Gets it away. Bear cash is called for. Made at the 8. So can they get into field goal range with 1.56? This, in effect, is the 2-minute warning. Kansas City, 19. Las Vegas, 17. Every week, high drama. Once again, here we go. From the 8. No timeouts. Dancing. Flag thrown. Catch made at the 11-yard line. Going right down there is Michael Mayer. Flag at the line of scrimmage. I think Chris Jones may have jumped. Again. Defense number 95. He did. Five-yard penalty. It's first and five. This whole potential drive by the Raiders will all come down to the protection. This secondary, I think, is vulnerable. I think you can throw the football on them. There's a little jump there, just a little early there by Jones. Can they protect O'Connell? Can they give him enough time with Jones, Karloftis, and company? Coming after him. And gained around 55 to 60 yards to give Carlson the confidence to make a field goal. He's missed three already today. O'Connell throws over the middle. Caught. Just shy of the first time, but then spinning. And picking it up to the 20-yard line. Abdullah, first down. What a job there. Being able to get away from Nick Bolton. Keep in mind, O'Connell has not played a lot of football with that thumb injury. This is where you hope just the knowledge of the offense allow him to play fast. 90 seconds Pass caught Short game here That's Mayer making the grab again The number two tight end Bolton Makes the tackle Good job of keeping him in bounds They're willing to give up the middle of the field And give up the yards As long as they can keep the ball in bounds No timeouts Second five The tunnel Fires Grab To the 50 yard line Goes Bowers What a move He's isolated against Reed A favorable matchup for the Raiders. This kid has wide receiver skill set. Just enough time to be able to make that throw. Under a minute from the 50. O'Connell fires. Over the right side, gain of a couple. Chris Jones stopping Abdul on that play. They missed the field goal plus territory. They had a turnover on downs. They could be much closer in this football game. Down 10, under six minutes to go now in this game. This is a drive they've got to find a way to finish. Big, big drive. 79 receptions. Only Odell Beckham had more receptions, 91 through his first 12 games in the history of the NFL. This guy's like Kelsey 2.0. He's the next Kelsey. Second and seven. McConnell fires into traffic drop. Incomplete. Try to get that one to Bowers. You've got Tranquil covering on the play. Third and seven upcoming. What a matchup that is between Tranquil and Bowers. Again, he's locking in right now on his guy. That ball got out early, so early. I think it surprised Bowers had snuck up on him. That was tight coverage by Tranquil, the linebacker. They put him out there again. Off to the right. See if his safety helps out. Rush for. A kind of chase. Look out from behind. Down he goes. Last thing they needed. A big sack. Karloftis. So you're in very makeable field goal range. And now, after a 15-yard sack, fourth and 22. That's a great point now. and Karloftis gets to sack, but it's really the coverage. He eventually does a good job with that relentless attitude. We wanted to see how is he going to find a way to get the ball to Bowers. Instead of worrying about 22, how about 20 Reid jams him. He's just trying to disrupt that timing, and he was looking at him to throw in the football, but because he jammed him, he'd disrupt the timing. 55-yard attack for Carlson. This one earlier. 45, this one is no good. Missed two. Still down by ten. After a good drive, comes up very empty. Four and a half to go in the third. You've been on anybody, right? Sure would. That crazy wild card game against Miami last year. Kaylee working the sidelines. Meanwhile, the pass year was dropped by Noah Gray. Second and ten. Yeah, people forget with the rule put in a couple years ago, only one team, when they went to seven teams in the playoffs, from each conference. Only one team gets a bye. Everybody else would have to win four, including the Super Bowl, to lift the Lombardi. Yeah, and in this AFC, I mean, you feel like it's going to go down in the final week or two, right? I mean, Pittsburgh potentially out there, Buffalo, Kansas City, Baltimore. I mean, it's going to be a great race for the end. Second and ten. Quick pass, and that's not pulled in. So, strangely enough, Gray and Kelsey, and neither could hold on. Yeah, that time they brought a blitz right off of Kelsey. And a quick throw, an easy throw, once he's able to recognize that by Patrick Mahomes. But you're right, not used to seeing this. Noah Gray on first and ten. This time Kelsey is starting. It just goes to show you as good as he is, best in the business, just starts to look a little bit early there on that second and ten. They're losing it, let's face it. Third and ten. Mahomes deep down the left sideline and is it holding Hopkins? Yes it is. DeAndre Hopkins. What a pickup. Tremendous career in his 12th year. Looking as good as ever. And watch the out and up and then the late hands against the rookie Richardson. Richardson never realized that the ball was this close to him because DeHop didn't even sell it to let him know the ball was coming. So the late hands there, what a job by the veteran on the route. And then the catch there on that big third and ten. Third and ten for 31 yards. To the 24. Mahomes, that's incomplete. Second down. Patrick Mahomes has had some typical Patrick Mahomes moments tonight in this football game. Avoiding the pressure. Crosby there at the end, still able to throw accurately and finding Kelsey. Here a little pump and go. About 14, 15 seconds in the first half. Jones with his eyes in the backfield. Here's the no look. Tongue out. Touchdown pass here. Look at the location of that football. Somehow has enough on it as he's being inside the 25-yard line. And that'll make it third down and let's call it five. See this, to me, you get this kind of cushion. You work across. I thought that you might see that robber that's sitting in the middle of that defense help out. But instead, he lets him go. He works across there against Jones. Even though Jones has great speed, he gives him that cushion. And Hopkins able to take advantage of that. P. Ryan III down. Back is in. Watson in motion. Mahomes throws. It's caught. Worthy inside the 10. Worthy out of bounds at about the 6. Juju Smith-Schuster creates a nice string for him to get underneath. Watch 9 go up against 18, who's in man coverage. He creates that. Now Jones is behind. He's actually looking across the field for some help. But that was a very good job there of the bigger receiver, Juju Smith-Schuster, at 215 pounds, setting that screen there, that rub at the beginning at the line of scrimmage. So from second and 20 to first and goal, bang, bang. Worthy is in the backfield. A little fake to him. Then a little shovel pass for a gain of a couple to Gray. Second down and goal from the four. Raiders ready for it that time. seen that play over the years spring open for Travis Kelsey. This time they try to get it to Gray with Worthy in the backfield. But I almost feel like Worthy in the backfield may be a bit of an indicator for the Raiders to look for that shovel pass. They were ready for it. Spotted at the five. Second and goal. Kareem Hunt is the running back. Fake to him. To the end zone. No. Too high. Hopkins on the truck anyway. Third down and goal. What a fun catch with those huge hands. Just a one-hand bag. Holds on to it, but no chance with the feet getting down. Yes, some of the largest hands of any receiver in the NFL. Able to just palm that with his fingertips. Look at that. That's a fingertip catch. Third and goal. The home is pressured and sacked. First guy in there, Chason. Chason is having a career night against Wanya Morris at the left tackle spot. He has struggled all year. It's not a newsflash, but this is a newsflash with the hands again. uses those hands and that jump to almost accelerate around him. He's done this same move up and around this entire game. You would think they would chip, use a tight end, anything on third down to help Morris on that left side. Right, to try to retake the lead, which he does from 32. I'll tell you what's a newsflash. Mahomes has now been sacked five times in each of the last two games. 1917 Kansas City 953 to go in regulation the fabric of this community this area the Kansas City Chiefs great love affair going on you can well understand it with what this team has been over the past several years meanwhile the run back here is after the 30-yard line lobby got a flag down And after an extended sidebar With bated breath, we wait the announcement During the return, a legal block in the back, receiving team number 88. Ten-yard penalty. First down. Okay, meanwhile, take a look right now at the AFC playoff picture. Again, one team gets the bye right now that would be Kansas City. You've got Buffalo, and you've got Pittsburgh, and you've got Houston leading each of the divisions. You've got Baltimore, the Chargers, and Denver right now would be the wild cards. Miami, Indianapolis, and the Bengals, as they say, in the hunt. Get ready for Joe Burrow and those Bengals to get hot. Look out. Telling you. I'm marking that down right now. 13-yard line. Raiders begin this drive. On the ground. Nice run. Pickup of nine. McCormick tackled by Jones. What a job this guy's doing again. Think about this. Practice squad for 23. Practice squad, most of 24. IR, 22 as a rookie, came out of UTSA. He's running like this is the opportunity of a lifetime because it is. They're now over 100 yards rushing on the night. They're dead last in the NFL. The line's doing their job, and the backs are getting upfield in a hurry tonight. Yeah, they've outrushed Kansas City by a 2-1 ratio. Second and short. First down and a few more. before Cicero McCormick is taken down by Chanel. First down. And again, it's just so important to be able to help this offensive line. Look at him. He's doing the Zeke Elliott. Just keep feeding me. Guy's feeling it. Low center of gravity. It was a really talented back, like I said, coming out of UTSA. Not heavily looked at as a guy that was going to come in and be a great NFL back. But it's fun to watch guys when they get their opportunity to see what they do with it. And last week, you get a taste of it. more of it this week. Play fake. Set up a screen, but no blocking out in front there. Taken down immediately by Justin Reed is McCormick. We keep showing you Scott Turner, who's the interim OC, his dad, Norv. Talking to Troy Aikman this week, I thought he made a really powerful comment when he talked about Norv Turner being the key to the Cowboys winning those Super Bowls. He said his entire career is indebted to Norv Turner, one of the best offensive minds in NFL history. That's Troy Aikman, one of the best ever play, giving the idea of what Norv Turner's meant to the NFL over the years. All you need to know is that he asked Turner to be the guy to induct him into the Hall of Fame. Pretty powerful. Had a few guys he could have chosen. Second and 12. Connell hanging in, looking. trying to find somebody along the near sideline, and that is hold in by Bowers right there with Tranquil covering on the play. It'll be third down. Yeah, it's one thing for this guy to go up and make catches in the end zone, and I'll tell you, he just does everything. We saw him on a jet sweep. Here are the hands. Catches the back end of the ball. Man, the ball may have come through there. We'll see if they take a look at that. But then the footwork to be able to get the feet down. The other thing that's surprising us a little bit is that O'Connell's using his feet to keep some of these players alive tonight. Look at that footwork. Possession. Yep, got that right foot round. Right toe in. Yeah, man. Impressive. Third down and nine. Crowd in full throat. Over the middle. The pressure was put on and the pass is incomplete. How do they get rid of it? The hurry and it's fourth down. They're trying to get a one-on-one matchup on that offensive line And by bringing the middle linebacker, Nick Bolton, and they did, it was enough for O'Connell to feel that pressure. Karloftis ends up winning. Like we said, you bring one, you get five guys, you get one-on-one matchups. Instead of it being Chris Jones, it's Karloftis here on that right side of the offensive line that wins. A.J. Cole, ready for his third punt of the night. McColl Hardman Backing up from the 20 Fields at the 18 Looks for room Tackle to the 25 646 left in regulation Kansas City leading big Now let me do this one I'm a Taco Bell fan It's been the offensive tackles for Kansas City We knew coming in that this is an issue Continues to be an issue Chason has had a big night on that left side. Max Crosby working against Taylor's had a big night as well. They've affected Mahomes. Not even necessarily having to blitz. Just being able to get pressure, making him uncomfortable. Not just about the sacks. It's gotten so bad they've moved their starting left guard. Tooney out to left tackle. And Mike Caliendo now, the backup left guard, is in the game. Here at a kind of critical point this game at 6.46 to go. Drive starts at the 25-yard line. I would have gone to the Taco Bell and Devontae Adams house setting up and traded. That's right. Anyway, second down, second and eight. You know, and again, they've signed D.J. Humphreys. I think a lot of Chiefs fans are hoping that eventually that becomes their answer at left tackle. But, you know, you think bigger, not just tonight. You think about the playoff run and hopefully for the Chiefs into the Super Bowl. They're going to have to figure things out up front on the edges. 10 sacks in two games tells you all you need to know. Max Crosby and Patrick Mahomes love to compete against each other. And this fourth quarter is going to be one to remember. And it's not just about 2-9 against 10-1. It's just two guys and two teams going at it. on third and one Chelsea taken down he has the first down though up to the 41 yard line they're not shopping all day and you've just tuned in no that's not a typo Raiders are up front in the fourth quarter and to think they've had other opportunities for points they came away with a couple missed field goals a turnover on downs and instead of going away they They just kind of kept battling. I think the kickoff return kind of was that turning point. And the fact that they were able to finish with O'Connell finding an opportunity to throw that touchdown pass to Brock Bowers. It was like a turning point, those sequence of plays. The 69-yard KOR. Mahomes pressured. Tennessee throws. Passes incomplete. Boy, the Crosby coming in that time to bust it up. the scary thing for the Chiefs when they get into these situations is the edge of Taylor on the right and Morris on the left and giving Mahomes enough time. Because when they get into obvious passing situations against a guy like Max Crosby, you know, he knows you're throwing. You get a little chip there from the back, and he still is able to beat Taylor to get to Mahomes. Mahomes rolling, signaling, throwing short. Brown wants a flag, and they get one. Pass was underthrown. You've got Hopkins. You've got Crosby putting the pressure on that time. And the flag for interference will take the ball all the way inside the 30-yard line. Once again, they try to move the launch point, get away. Let's run away and get away from the pressure of Crosby. It's a good job of adjusting. You actually see him. Mahomes points to him. He says, get up field. Go. Go. And he can't quite get enough on it because of Max Crosby. Look, instead of sitting in that pocket, let's get away from it. It's just relentless with his approach. 98. Max Crosby almost once again gets to him. Yes. That time. Offense number 64. That time. My guard penalty. First down. Juan Yee the left. Oh, man. You know what Hopkins is great at, among other things? He draws defensive penalties. That's 47 in his career. Drawn, pass interference, penalties. That's a little hidden stat there. So invaluable. That was a huge first down to move into the Raiders' territory. After he dropped one, the last time they had the ball. First and 15 now. Extra pressure. Thrown out of bounds. Happens that time. Covered very well by Jack Jones. Second and 15. Remember Jack Jones had that pick six when they knocked off the Chiefs and had that upset last year, Christmas Day. They needed some things to happen. They had a couple big turnovers. Jones had that pick six. He's a bit of a guesser. He's holding up on the island so tonight. They've left him out there. He's a very, very talented cover corner. That one loss, 62-1, to the Chargers back in 2018. Second and 15. Mahomes, again, signaling. Flag is thrown. Looking over to the Raiders sideline. They want to... Illegal formation. Decline it. Offense number 74 was in the backfield. Penalties declined. Third down. It's the third down and 15 now. Correction. Las Vegas has decided to enforce the penalty. Five yards. Second down. All right. A lot of changes of mind today, huh? Yeah. He's not on the line of scrimmage once again. Second time it's been an issue. And, again, he's just trying to cheat as much as he can to help himself with getting depth, getting back to help in that pass protection set that he's in against Crosby. So they make it second and 20 instead of third and 15. Mahomes throws, and that's Hopkins. And he takes the ball in 52 yards, and there's Max with the frustration. He wanted that sack. There's Bowers. Just worth reminding people. We've said it a bunch. Let's just continue to remind people that this Chiefs team has been so close. Eight times won possession games. Five times they've won in the last play of the game. There's Aiden O'Connell outside the numbers. Between the numbers, much better going to the outside. That's our next-gen stats powered by AWS. So from the 31-yard line, this drive starts on the ground. Slip into the outside. Trying to get around the corner. And he does. Nice game. Sincere McCormick. And sincerely, that's the end of the third quarter in Kansas City. On this Black Friday with Kansas City leading Las Vegas 16-10. George Brett played that. George Brett, of course. That was one, too. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung start the fourth. McConnell, deep down the sideline, getting free! And into the end zone, Trey Tucker. Holy mack, whoa. The Oakland Raiders, now known as the Las Vegas Raiders, but this is a blast from the past. Like Stabler to Branch. What is going on here? 58 yards. What a ball again by Aiden O'Connell. We keep talking about him and what he's doing. Facing some pressure. But he's getting the ball out. And he's giving these receivers a chance. And you're going to have to recognize Scott and Norv Turner for this play call. And the motion. And how that motion impacted in creating this matchup. And Steve Spagnuolo stunned. As Tucker got free. 58 yards. Carlson to try to give the Raiders the lead. And my man, the shades of the Oakland Raiders right there. I'm thinking, you know, Sable to Brent, you name it. Yeah. Plunket, LaMonica, the whole thing. What's going on here? Look at the motion with Tucker. Look at how Kansas City reacts. That reaction is critical because now you have a speedster against the safety. So a great ball, but a great job by Scott Turner moving Tucker over. The adjustment by the Chiefs, you could see the communication in the back end, was to move Reed over. It's exactly what the Raiders wanted. That's the matchup they wanted. And what a job here with the speed by Tucker. He's an undersized guy at 5'9", but a lot of times these vertical threats, they're tall, they're longer. This guy's a little shorter, but has that natural feel downfield. And O'Connell's got to feel so good with how he has battled back in his football game to give the Raiders the lead. But again, Scott Turner, North Turner, what a call to get him isolated to give O'Connell a chance to make that throw. What a game. Well, really, a coming of age. They were the Turner father and son. It's almost a coming of age game here for O'Connell. I mean, if he becomes the guy down the line, you'll look back to this day. Most important thing as you look into the eyes there, one of the better players in the NFL, this team's 2-9. 2-9. They've lost seven in a row. Antonio Pierce said how much he's been impressed with their attitude and how they still want to compete. They still show up to practice. Sometimes we love Antonio. I mean, we love Antonio. But you wonder, is that just coach talk or not? It's not. Well, this team has showed up to battle today, and they got a lead here late. I'll tell you what's junk talk. People talk about tanking. I don't understand. What are you talking about? Like players are going to not play their best and to what? Get a better draft situation so they can lose their job? What do you tell me? Don't listen to all the... I'm with you, man. Let's just enjoy the game. Right. You can parse the hell out of everything. Mahomes back to pass. Under pressure. and to take off and get taken down from behind hard by Adam Butler. This is what you've got to love, right? When he's doing pump fanks and he's three yards past the line of scrimmage and the guys fall for it. That's a point guard, right? Watch Merrick's seven. He crosses the line. Here's safety. Jumps up into the air. He gets a few more yards. Again, this is where Patrick Mahomes is at his best. Everybody's like, oh, no, what's happening? The Raiders have the lead. He's done it throughout his career, and he's especially done it this year. When a game's on the line, he finds a way to win a football game. Week after week after week. Passes scored a little shy of the first down, and the tackle is made unworthy by Divine Diablo. So it'll be third down and one, a minute in to the fourth quarter.
