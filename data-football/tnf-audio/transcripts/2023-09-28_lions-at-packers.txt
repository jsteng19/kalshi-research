 Because he wanted to be a lot quicker. See this movement shooting a gap. Watch the right guard 76 run you in polling. And 85 doesn't even have a chance, Kraft, to make the block because of how sudden and quick McNeil gets off the ball. So that commitment that McNeil made to losing weight, really more about being a pass rusher, what a difference he is getting vertical and getting upfield, making a great play against the run. Pistol is done. Love pressure. Down he goes at the 7. Aline McNeil again. Back to back. Big plays for him. 3rd and 22. Against Royce Newman who is in there for Jenkins. We just talked about how he dropped weight to become a better pass rusher. Made a great play against the run. Comes back the very next play. Fights through Newman. Ends up working through the left tackle Walker. And comes up with a big sack. For those of you keeping score at home, that gets added to the total or subtracted. The Packers now have minus one yard. Minus one yard. Third and 21. Love pressured again to the outside. Completes it, but they needed too much. Dobbs makes the catch. Pick up a bunch here. Gain a 15 fourth down. This is a defense from Detroit that last year was dead last in total defense. Pass defense was 30th. Scoring defense was 28th. They made some adjustments. They feel more comfortable in the Aaron Glenn scheme. They're playing a little bit softer. But, man, tonight they are dominating the line of scrimmage. This is Whelan's fourth punt of the night. Faircast called for and made by Raymond in the 24-yard line. Five and a half to go to the half after a 52-yard boot. 24-3 Detroit. 24-yard line. Montgomery. You know, we were talking to Goff the other day. And Goff said he made a very good point. He said, you know, people look at Dan Campbell, you don't know him. Just the way he is, and he starts out like you're going to bite your kneecaps off in the press conference. They think he's a meathead. And Dom said, he's anything but. Yeah, he was talking about how much knowledge he has, not just offense, but the defense, special teams. Keep in mind, he was around Sean Payton for a number of years down in New Orleans. He talked about how Sean Payton is really his mentor, taught him everything about becoming a head coach. Of course, he's added his own style to that. Second and six. Caught. Fighting his way. But can't get to that line of the game. Sam Laporta just a little bit short. Third down. Boy Walker made the tackle. And I think all week we heard from a number of players about how much they really love having former players as position coaches and coordinators and how they can relate so well to what these players on this Lions roster are facing and going through. It's sprinkled all throughout the entire staff. Third in the yard. Montgomery got it. And a few more to the 40. Ticking down a four-minute. Hollins makes the stop first out. The reason this Lions team, forget about tonight. I'm talking this year. The reason they're real is because of this offensive line and I think the addition of David Montgomery and Jameer Gibbs in that backfield to go along with Goff and what he has to work with on the outside. This is a real team. I know we get excited about Philadelphia and San Francisco and other teams in the NFC, but people have to start paying attention to Detroit. Tipped low. Carl Brooks got his hand on it. And the official is checking, and they're going to spot the ball. Back at the line of scrimmage. Incomplete pass. You know, we were talking about the running game. You were talking about Gibbs and Montgomery. They had a 1,000-yard rusher last year. Mal Williams and DeAndre Swift, who we saw up in week two for Philadelphia. He's having a hell of a year. So they break up that tandem and get these guys. Second and ten. the fires incomplete over the middle Sam Laporte in some traffic third and ten this is a heck of a throw here he gets pressured on his left again Gary is a force that Decker is trying to deal with left tackle but he's able to feel that get the ball out and gives the rookie tight end a great chance there's a long way to go they proved that last week what they can do I think what we saw in that fourth quarter was some urgency and some tempo, and I think it really helped a young quarterback in Jordan Love execute much better. Second and five. Love tosses back. No, nothing happening there. Great defensively. Cam Sutton comes up to spill him behind the line of scrimmage. It'll be third down and seven. But I think it really starts out with this defense. Watch the flow and the speed of this defense, and watch how they string out, Not surprised at all by this option. Look at that defense. Branch right there takes the quarterback, and there's nowhere to go after this pitch. That's disciplined defense there for Aaron Glenn, the defensive coordinator, and flying to the football by the Lions. Packers can't get out of their own way. Third and seven. So Glenn there on the sideline. Love hanging in, and that's batted away. an incomplete hit for Watson. And Brian Branch is there. And you don't hear a lot of boos at Lambeau, but plenty of them right now. With his defense, Hutchison, second year, saw a sack already earlier tonight. Even when he doesn't get there, it's just the way he plays, the energy in which he plays with. And this guy right here, to me, is the steal of the draft. The rookie out of Alabama, Brian Branch, kind of a Tyron Matthew type of player that time with his versatility. Great play. Whelan's kick Raymond is there 20 yard line avoids a tackle runs it back 10 yards up to the 30 Lions have drafted well take a look at that foursome right there Gibbs, Campbell, Laporta and Branch all making their presence felt at this point in the season It's easy now to say that they're making their presence felt when a lot of these guys were drafted there are a lot of question marks and people wondering if they were reaching. Brad Holmes, Chris Spielman I know also helps. They put their minds together with his entire staff with Dan Campbell and came up with four guys that are impact players and making a difference in this Lions team. Goff throws. Complete. And that's St. Brown picking up enough for the first down as he angles to his left. The 11-yard game. And I think, Al, one of the things when you talk to them about what they look for, it's not just talent. How you change culture, every one of them talk about we're looking for guys that love football, have a chip on their shoulder, want to practice, want to work at getting better. And if you look at every one of those four players, they all have that in common. going with a fullback this time and give it to montgomery you know we're talking about that flag is down talking about that montgomery and the trade with goff and stafford Number 73, offense. Ten-yard penalty. We play. Jonah Jackson. The guard, they picked up. Not only did they get golf, they got draft picks, and they made the most of those picks, two firsts and a third. Absolutely. And you're bringing in guys that are contributing and making plays, and I think it takes time to do it the right way, right? Because you've got to do it through the draft. You can't just do it through free agency for a quick fix. They've built this thing from the ground up. that have done it the right way. Again, you look around at their roster, a lot of these guys are still very young in their careers. First and 20 now, low snap, handles it. Gain is three. Here's Montgomery taking it for a short gain, and we go to Kaylee. Wow, Sam Laporta and Jared Goff, they struck the right chord with each other. They both say at their very first practice this offseason, coming in as a rookie, Laporta admitted it was overwhelming to first look at a playbook. He said he has a tendency to overanalyze, but he really phrased Goff's ability to break down plays for him and the rest of the rookies. Telling him exactly what he's looking for in a way that a reporter says makes it really simple for them to just go out and execute. Yeah, his career off to a great start. Got into the end zone tonight. Second and 18. Goff incomplete. Third and 18. The crowd finally has something to cheer about. Isaiah McDuffie planted Goff that time. On 32 yard line third and 18 a little bit more reminiscent of what they did the first Series when they were just getting off of blocks and applying pressure this time they bring both eat the inside linebackers And again, it's not always about the sack Sometimes it's just about getting that pressure on second long and forcing him to get rid of that football To possession lead Rodney Patterson bangs that one through with ease And we're back in 30 seconds. That's what makes it, I think, so unique. I just can't think of two guys being the faces of a franchise for 30 years. Meanwhile, Nixon, who loves to run kicks out of the end zone, does so here. And only gets to the 22-yard line and the flag is strong. During the return, holding number six in the receiving team. Half the distance to the goal from the spot of foul. First out. Let's see if Green Bay, now they're back deep into their own territory, focusing so much on Jordan Love. But to me it's as much about the offensive line remember their two best linemen on the left side Jenkins abacatari are not in this game John Runyon the right guard is playing with an ankle So they got to find ways to give love more time. They've been losing the line of scrimmage Play action tip pick 26 yard line Jerry Jacobs inside the 10. He gets down in the 6-yard line. Tipped that time by Alex Anzalone, the linebacker. Man, a lot of Lions fans here tonight. You can hear them. Well, this is a heck of a job. Anzalone here and the linebackers. Watch the backers come down against the run and then retreat. Watch how fast they get downhill. They see play action and right there he gets his hand on the football to allow that interception to come to fruition there by Jerry Jacobs. So a really good job by Anzalone, the leader of this defense, the vocal leader with his read key there, getting back in that throwing lane of Jordan Love. From the seven. First and goal. Finds the hold, does Montgomery. Binge forward to the two-yard line, second and goal early in the second. I thought Kareem Bay got tested a week ago when they were down 17 in the fourth quarter. Came back to win. Now you get tested very next week. They go fast. They go no huddle. Trying to keep that St. Packard defense out there. Second down and goal. Keep it on the ground. Through the middle. There he goes again. And Montgomery for six. Second touchdown tonight for Montgomery. And a big hole for the second consecutive week built by the Green Bay Packers. Look at the hole right here. Look at this gap. Makes it pretty easy for this offensive line to work a double team there and just kind of kick out. It's like Justin Hollins there. They just kick out. but a gaping hole for them to be able to run through. Patterson. He's been busy tonight. Three extra points in the field goal already. Less than two minutes into the second 24-3 Lions. Jayden Reed's going to let it bounce through the end zone. And so in the NFC North right now, winner of this game, undisputed possession of first early in the year, packing Lions 2-1, the Vikings and the Bears still trying to get off the snide. Obviously very early in the season, long way to go. But if you're a Detroit Lions fan, you're watching this game right now, how excited are you with the way this team finished last year, with the way they've started this year, the way they're playing tonight, the culture change, the speed, the attitude, the quarterback play, the offense of Ben Johnson, It's a lot to be excited about for Lions fans. So now Aaron Jones. He's been hurt. Get him into the action here up to the 30-yard line. He goes proud. They had one total yard until that run. Now they have six total yards. Kind of a sarcastic cheer there by the Lambeau faithful. They want to see some offense and get back into this football game. and they're believing. Now that's up to the defense. Good job. All the momentum going to the right. Come back to the inside. There's nobody there. See 21 Walker there just completely fooled. Kind of got caught up with the quarterback rolling that way. All the routes going that way. And then a good call by Matt LaFleur to bring Reed back underneath the coverage. What a difference. you know he challenged him just based on what he said to Kaylee about how they were frustrated and embarrassed and wants to see who wants to fight in this second half. Down to Kaylee. Well, guys, just after we saw Lions corner, Brian Branch carted off the field. He was taken straight to the x-ray room. And about a minute later, the Lions told us he would be questionable to return. They're looking at his right ankle. And the Packers, an update there as they are now ruling out tight end Luke Musgrave after he was evaluated under concussion protocol. They say questionable. A guy goes off on a cart. But you know what? I did the game here, the opening game in 2008. People forget it. Bears led 17-0 at the half, 20-0. Aaron Rodgers taken out on a cart. He's done, right? No way he's coming back. No way he's coming back. Second half, back he comes. Three touchdown passes. 75 yards to Randall Cobb. They win the game. Craig Reynolds. mistake early with that interception but since then has pretty much been in command been a beneficiary of really good offensive line play from the 27 begin with the ground game here Clay Walker taking down David Montgomery been the workhorse tonight 16 carries for David for 56 yards the offense answered the challenge from Green Bay and Matt LaFleur, let's see how the defense can respond. Again, they're going to have to take some chances and get some safeties down against this run game to help out against the offensive line coming off the football and the running of Montgomery and Gibbs. But be careful against the play action, those one-on-one chances, giving up a big play. Pressure from the outside, pass through. The tackling is right there perfect way Walker taken kids down To the crowd right now in a frenzy third down and 12 got fires caught but a beautiful tackle and it's a quick three and out rasul douglas right there to take st brown to the ground love puts the helmet on ready to come back for the next drive well the defense follows the offense's lead and does their job they get it three and out and You know, you could say it's a different game, it's a different opponent, but don't think that these Green Bay Packers aren't thinking about what they did in the fourth quarter last week coming back from 17. Jack Fox. The punter. Reed is there. Fair catch made. 30-yard line, 6-16 to go in the third. Lions lead 27-11. And they've taken them up who knows We may now from the 30-yard line Blue baby that's a live ball and goes out of bounds Tracy Walker came flying in coming up a big game last week It's definitely a backwards pass just trying trying to throw it to Dobbs but Detroit all over that. And it's almost one of those plays where you wonder if he's thinking about the possibility of Dobbs throwing it back. But look at the penetration. I mean, Love was lucky to get that ball off because of Tracy Walker in his face. Yeah, they tried that trick play last week and it did not work. Second and 21. It's a loss of 11 yards on the play. 545 left in the third. There's Hutchinson looking for the spot. Here he comes. Take care of him. Deep pass incomplete. Intended for Reed Walker covering. Back to Kaylee. Well, guys, as you saw Brian Branch out here on that training table, they put an adhesive heating pad right on that bare ankle and then gave him a solid tape job. You can see him as well as I can. He doesn't look to be in any pain. When he came out of the tunnel, he was walking on his own accord. And wheel in the rookie punter. Sties one. Good punt. Backing up. Raymond, 35. And a decent run back as he takes it back to the 45. I'm older. I'm more mature. The best thing I can do, I respond to adversity. First drive. This pick almost gave up some points. Only a field goal. Here's a big third down the next time they get the football to La Porta. And then the touchdown to St. Brown. A great response and answer from Detroit and their quarterback, Jared Goff. Really maybe a glimpse into the future with Gibbs and Laporta and St. Brown, such young skill around Goff and so explosive. And as you say, I totally agree. Goff's playing his best football right now. This is a guy who actually led the Rams into the Super Bowl in 2018. That pass is too high. You know, you look at that trade again, Kirk, and obviously it turned out great for the Rams. They traded, you know, and got Stafford. They wanted to win that Super Bowl in their $5 billion stadium on that day, and they did. But now you look toward the future, and, you know, Goff is a lot younger than Stafford. Who knows what happens down the road here. He's still young. What a move by Brad Holmes, you know, to make that move and all the moves that they've made since, the way they've drafted. Boy, it's a young team, and they're going in a great direction. They're lucky to have Goff there. Draw play on a second and ten. And a nice little burst here for a game of seven by Jameer Gibbs. Third down and three with number seven to play in the opening frame. And I really think they've changed the image. And I think it started, there's John Runyon getting that left ankle tape. I think it started with hard knocks a year ago. And the personality of Dan Campbell came out. I think a lot of people that didn't really know much about Detroit or Dan Campbell kind of fell in love with his personality and what he was trying to communicate and sell with the culture change. And I think a lot of people are like, man, I'd want to play for that guy. That kind of approach. Wanted to bite off your kneecaps. Opening press conference, pass caught on the run. Josh Reynolds to the 30 and a little bit beyond. So Reynolds, first four years as a Ram, so he and Goff bosom buddies your 23-yard game. Yeah, great chemistry. I think right here is what he's looking at. Savage trying to almost bait Goff into a throw where he jumps St. Brown late, and then it opens up that next level to Reynolds. So a really good read and feel there, getting the ball to his guy at that second level. At the 25-yard line now. Hand them all off inside Giggs. Montgomery. three. Klaus is way forward. Through contact, picks up close to nine. It's a job by Jonah Jackson, the left guard. We keep talking about this offensive line. They get great blocking angles. It's great to see Sewell, Pene Sewell now back to the right side. Watch the left guard pull around here, but watch the right side. Get those Green Bay Packers turned to open it up for Jackson to be able to pull around and lead Montgomery. Second and two. And finding his way forward appears to be a first down is Montgomery. Stopped behind the line of scrimmage. Kept the legs churning. And they'll spot the ball just at about the 15-yard line right on it. And that will be good enough for a first down. Great individual effort. I was with you. I was like, I think he got it. I think he got it. Because he got hit in the backfield. miscommunication there with Laporta, the tight end, but that effort shows you when he's healthy, what he can do. That was all him picking up that first down yardage. Goff. He's going to pack it in, and he will go inside the five and tackled at the three by Rudy Ford, who had the interception earlier. So Goff on the run for a gain of 12. I asked Goff, I said, they'll play a lot of zone, but you get in the red zone. What are you going to do at that point? He said, they're going to play a lot more man. Look at the linebackers, Walker, clear out. This is Goff who does not run. He's not a threat at all. But, again, great job of seeing that open up right away. So instead of waiting because nobody accounted for him in man coverage, he just took off and got a first down inside the five. 41 rushing yards for the Lions already stuffed at the line of scrimmage it's Wayne Walker number 7 right there to take down Montgomery second and goal kickoff for 16 years we saw Mason Crosby with a changing of the guard there Craig Reynolds is back to receive Green Bay won the toss and deferred and away we go from Lambeau Field starting at the 25-yard line. So Jared Goff, number one pick back in 2016 by the Rams, number one overall pick, then traded to Detroit for Matthew Stafford and a bunch of picks. 70% completion, five TDs and two picks, and a rushing touchdown, which he scored last week, and then threw the ball into the upper deck through a Hail Mary to the crowd. David Montgomery starts in the backfield. One with Bear. Give it to him right away. Can't go anywhere. Taken down there by Preston Smith, number 91 for no game. He'll be second down and 10. You look at Goff, kind of the forgotten man in that trade with Stafford. The Rams went on to win the Super Bowl, and we talked to him about that. He said, yeah, it was hard not to take it personally when he went to Detroit, and the Rams went on to have that success. But, you know, he's battled through. I would argue he's playing his best football of his career over the last part of the second half of last year and into this year. Great command of this Ben Johnson offense. Agreed. In his eighth season in the league. Off the play fake. The pass out in the flat here, but nothing happening there either. As the catch is made by Khalif Raymond, taken down by Rasool Douglas, who a good start by that Packer defense at third down and 12. Green Bay's defense accepting the challenge this week in a short week from their coaches. They've heard all week about the physicality of Detroit. They're coming out early with a lot of speed. Green Bay defense shutting out the Saints in the second half. Third and long out of a tight formation. Packers rush five. Goff steps up, throws picked off at the 43-yard line by Rudy Ford. And Ford takes it deep into Lions territory. So Goff, who went 10 games without a pick, has now thrown an interception in three consecutive games. Give Joe Barry a lot of credit, the defensive coordinator from Green Bay. All the coordinators in the NFL, they always move around guys and make you have to try to think after the snap. And, you know, they just sat in zone. It wasn't anything necessarily that should have tricked Jerry Goff. Ford was in underneath coverage there as a safety. And Goff, you see his eyes kind of working around, comes back late to his left where he originally had started to try to get it to St. Brown. Throws it late over the middle. And, of course, Ford right there reading his eyes makes the play. So Watson and Jones are both back from injuries. He's there in this set from the 14-yard line. Love has a little bit of time. Secondary does his job. He takes off. He's got mobility. And the pass incomplete, second down and 10. So Jordan Love was picked in the draft in 2020. I'm shocked the hell out of Aaron Rodgers at that point. As Rodgers said, he went right to the liquor cabinet. And pretty much like Rodgers with Favre, he had to wait three years, and now he gets his opportunity. But his college ball at Utah State grew up near Bakersfield, California And said Utah State was the only school that came after a credible probably talked all week this week about Josh Allen's only Opportunity grew up in the same area only opportunity was Wyoming both these guys now at the highest level competing second time Hanging in the pocket. Look out. It collapses. Taken down to the 26-yard line. Aiden Hutchinson. Boy, did he come alive last week. Of course, he was the number two overall pick in the draft back in 22. Watch him here. Yeah, usually beats you to the outside. Here they use a little twist, move him back to the inside, and he beats John Runyon. Two Michigan guys going head-to-head. But great coverage downfield to allow Hutchinson, who finished, as you said, strong last week with those two sacks, comes up with his third of the year. Lions had one sack through two games and seven last week against Atlanta. Third and 19. Rush four, pass caught. Inside the 20 and the 16-yard line goes Romeo Dobbs. Went the game-winning touchdown last week. And in comes the field goal unit. a pretty good job by Detroit's defense considering the hold that they were in after that interception. Good job of obviously getting that pressure in the sack on that second down, put them way behind the sticks. Now you're looking at third and 18. And a whistle. Decker hadn't been playing football much lately, So the crowd may be affecting him there on the left side. So third down and 23 now. Lions have 11 first downs. Packers have none. Third and 23 Over the middle Complete but well well well short of the first down Walker takes Gibbs down And the Lions will punt. First Detroit punt of the game. So much was made about Jordan Love last week. But it was the defense that forced five punts in that second half to give them a chance to get back into the game. Right. The defense only gave up 10 of those points because the other seven came on a run back. Jack Fox, who normally booms in this one, shorter than normal for him. But it takes a nice little bounce for him. And then it's juggled. And then can the Packers save it or not as it's a scramble inside the eight-yard line? and they're able to recover it after Jaden Reed couldn't handle it. Here it is again. Trying to pick it up on two hops. Oh boy, everybody got away with it. They got very, very fortunate. And this is a rookie back there trying to make a play. And then he starts to hurry. Very fortunate. Looked like Keiondre Thomas ended up getting on top of that football. 43 green. Somehow the ball came back to him. Boy, that could have been the kill shot. Oh, yeah. The three possession lead. This green babe can take over. Can they get something going here? No first downs. four total yards. A.J. Dillon is the back. Play action. Chase in the end zone. Love left-handed throws it to avoid the safety. And Luke Musgrave makes the grab. Aiden Hutchinson that time almost picked up two points. I can't believe this. I saw Drake May last week, a right-handed quarterback who's going to be one of the first picks next year in the draft throw a left-handed touchdown as a right-hander. And now within the same week, we've got Jordan Love just trying to avoid the safety because of Hutchison, who's relentless, just gets rid of it with the left hand. That's all he could do. That'd be the worst feeling in the world. You're a quarterback, you know, you're going to get sacked for a safety. Flip it away. Second and nine. To the outside goes that pass. And that's good. About four yards shy of the first down to Romeo Dobbs. Third and four. You talk about a play being symbolic of a first half. It couldn't have gone any worse for Matt LaFleur in this Packers offense. And he looks like he's going to get sacked for his safety. Of all people, it's Aiden Hutchinson, who's just a relentless pass rusher. And somehow he just gets rid of the ball. Love three out of nine. 15 yards. They spread it out here. Now they get Dillon back into the backfield. Three receivers to the right. And the Lions jump, but who jumped first? Reaction there by Walker after the movement by Charles Harris. They'll take a first down any way they can get it. And the crowd erupts. They have been pinned back in their deep, deep in their own territory these last few possessions. The 10 and then the 8. There's the reaction and the movement there by Harris. Like you said, whatever it takes. From the 19. Dillon stopped in his tracks. Aleem McNeil, number 54. He drops some weight into Goff's face. Rodney Patterson came over in a trade with the Jaguars. And that kick is good just inside the left upright with 34 ticks. Well, I can tell you the Falcons and the Jaguars are not just playing the game in London. On Sunday, they're also going to be transformed into the world of Pixar's Toy Story. Don't miss Toy Story Fun Ball Football this Sunday at 9.30 a.m. Eastern on ESPN+. Kaylee, what you got? Al, the Packers need all the help they can get, but we just watched tight end Luke Musgrave walk off the field. We are told he's being evaluated under concussion protocol, Al. That's good. I mean, they really like him a lot. That ended at Oregon State. Went off to a good start. The first three games, he's back being checked out. The floor looking at that play sheet thinking, you know, he's got to come up with a way to help that offensive line. You've got an athletic quarterback. You can move the launch point, move the pocket around, get him out away from that pressure, screens, anything to try to get Jordan Love into some kind of rhythm. You know, his receivers are so young. They're either rookies or second-year guys. You know, you think about it. It's a kiddie core. And that wide receiver room is like romper room. Right, right. And think they've been working with. You remember that show, right? Oh, yeah. They've been working without Watson. At least you see nine. He's back and without Aaron Jones. So we thought, boy, they have some more explosive playmakers back. But they can't get a play call because of what's happening up front. Exactly. Too much pressure on them. Look at Hutchison over that left guard on the inside. Can't wait to get rolling. That time they stop him. But that pass does next to nothing. Aguera making the play. Second down and five. Said a couple of timeouts. Not using him here. Look out. Love. Out of trouble for the moment. And then you got John Kaminsky burying him as he just throws it away. Third down and five. Kaminsky says, let me get in on the act. It's not just about Aiden Hutchison and McNeil. See, again, they've moved Hutchison to the inside there over the left guard, but it's the other side, a good effort with Kaminsky, showing strength and then finishing on that play. Showed that wrinkle last week. We asked Hutchison if he likes being moved to the inside. He said, at first I wasn't real excited about being asked to move in there, but if it helps the team, and I'm starting to kind of understand it, he's got such good lateral quickness. It's really a mismatch for him against an offensive guard. Packer fans haven't witnessed very many first halves like this. Love caught up at the 42. Aguero, so it's for seven seconds, 35. You know, Kirk, you think about this too. The Lions are trying to win games in two of the tougher places in the league, Arrowhead and Lambeau, in the month of September. And I think that game against the Chiefs caught the entire league's attention, don't you? Yep. The way that game was played, how athletic they looked, and you follow it up with a game like this in Lambeau on this stage. People kind of made Detroit the it team. Look out for these guys. Third timeout. Detroit. Third timeout. Detroit's going to take a timeout here. I mean, this was the hot team at the end of last year, end of the season. They started 1-6. Remember Campbell? Campbell started his career like 4-19-1. I mean, why? And then all of a sudden they got hot, trying to make it 3 out of 4 this year. And, again, the 8 team. But you're right. That opening night, when you don't beat Kansas City too often at Arrowhead. No, and I think, again, you get the pick six from Brian Branch, and some of these younger players started to make plays. It was like, they're not just winning the game. They look athletic. They look like they're the aggressor. And so I think how they responded to that week two loss, they came back last week against Atlanta and just dominated the game. Now here they are again. They're up 27-3 potentially at half. Athletic and very physical. Yep. Forcing Green Bay into this field goal. So now Carlson 34-yard attempt. He was a sixth-round draft choice out of Auburn. As we said, Mason Crosby had been here for the last 16 years. Daniel Whelan to hold it. He's also a rookie. And the turnover is paid off with a field goal. Three minutes into the game. It is Green Bay 3, Detroit nothing. Carlson to kick off at the second time. And Reynolds lets it go. Once again, Jared Goff comes out and starts this drive once again from the 25-yard line. So one pick in each of his last three games. He went 10 games. He had 383 consecutive passes without an interception. The third longest of all time. Exceeded only by Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady. Keep in mind with Decker back, you heard Kaylee talking about that. Sewell goes from left tackle to right tackle. You're talking about one of the top offensive lines in the league. They've got to get their run game going tonight. Montgomery picks up two. David in his fifth year. In the league first here, Preston Smith again makes the stop, second and eight. Early going in this game. One of the great battles in the game within the game will be that offensive line going against the Green Bay front. Right now the Packers are just attacking the line of scrimmage and getting off the blocks, making it tough with the line of scrimmage. Like I said, they've been challenged on that all week to match that physicality. So Montgomery out and now the rookie Jameer Gibbs comes in. Number 12 overall pick at Alabama. They love him, I mean, truly. And a burst forward, and you watched him play a lot in college, starting at Georgia Tech and then in Alabama. Yeah, he was at Georgia Tech having a great career, and then, you know, in the transfer portal era that we're in in college football, Nick Saban needed a back. He went down to Tuscaloosa and had a brilliant one year in Alabama. Not only did he show the ability to run on the perimeter, but between the tackles could get tough yards. And probably his best ball, I think he's a three-down back in the NFL because of the way he can catch the ball out of the backfield and even line up at times as a receiver. Third and short, they bring Montgomery back in with an extra tight end, and he thrusts forward up to the 36-yard line for Detroit's first down. There were three tight ends, obviously short yardage. You need a good push. Boy, Green Bay, again, they're coming off the ball. Slayton that time, 93, doing a good job there. But just enough room for Montgomery. Good to see him back in the lineup. He and Gibbs together, a formidable duo, I think, in that backfield for the Lions. Yeah, Montgomery had a nice opener, and then out for the last two games. Gibbs is back in, and sends him out into the pattern, and he gets crushed as he makes the grab, and that's Quay Walker making the tackle. You try to get a guy out in space, and that space closes quickly. And I think Walker's seeing the game a lot faster, like most guys in their second year. There he is, seven, just sitting back in zone, but reading the eyes, the check down right away, taking away the space that you had talked about, Al, with that quickness. And like I said, I think he's seeing the game a lot faster and reacting much quicker year two. Another Georgia Bulldog is Walker. And bunched up right there, T.J. Slayton takes care of David Montgomery. And Detroit now with a third down. You used to come in and watch Green Bay with Kenny Clark making a difference up front, but they've moved Kenny Clark now out to the edge, playing more defensive end away from that nose. And so Slayton, you've seen him a lot here early in his game, 93, making some plays for him against this run game. Third down and five for Detroit. Packers on top, 3-0, taking advantage of the interception. Doff retreats, fires over the middle, caught on the run, inside the 40-yard line, inside the 30, and that is Sam Laporta, a great-looking rookie tight end out of where else, Iowa, where they grow him. No doubt. You get man-to-man because of the motion. Good indicator there for Goff. He knows who he wants to go to right away, and I think that's the difference. We're talking about how he's playing. I think second year in this Ben Johnson offense, especially on third downs, he gets a good idea of where he wants to go with the football and has answers. Not bad coverage at all by Douglas, but a great throw out in front, and the rookie tied in who had the big play last week gets the first down. 35 yards. Goff. Attacker for Detroit. It's one of those, you're going to change your arm angle to get it around the pressure, and, you know, Detroit already, of course, C.J. Gardner-Johnson has been out. Kirby Joseph inactive tonight, so two of your safeties out. Now you see your nickel, Brian Branch out. So Will Harris asked to move in and play, make some quick play there. Went right at him. Backpedaling, flag thrown, off balance. Jones will go nowhere and pay the price as well. He's let the flag come in to be. Walker with a hold. That's Rasheed Walker. He is having a rough night against his pass rush. I mean, they're trying to set up a screen. Holding, number 63 offense. The Tony has declined. It's third down. He's got Charles Harris. You know, usually it's Hutchinson who's getting in there quickly, but this time it's Harris. 53, good inside move, and really the only thing that Walker could do is just grab on to him. And Walker taking the spot, normally occupied by David Bakhtiari, who's missed so many games over the last couple of seasons and went on IR tonight. third down 15 pressured gets it away to the 16 yard line he goes for an HVAC fourth year player out of Cincinnati and there goes Branch that's a bad sight back to the locker room he goes I hate to see that Hopefully he's going to be okay. I'm sure they're going to take a closer look at that, maybe with an x-ray. You know, that screen's a good decision. Set a big fourth down up here. They've got a nice drive. They've got to convert. Yeah, if we get a field goal, make it 27-6. They need seven. Can they get it? Love fires. Caught. Two-yard line. Romeo Dobbs. Can they get a first and goal? brought the pressure and a good job of sitting in there and then making a heck of a throw. Put the safety in a tough spot. Melifon will back here. Watch him jump the route underneath and then he has a great opening right behind there to make that throw. 15 yards on a fourth and nine. First and goal. Looking for a spot over the right side. Goes A.J. Dillon. Second down and goal. What a drive here. First half, the entire half, 20 yards. And this drive, 85 yards. 11 plays. Again, started with a penalty on the run back. Now you've got an injured lion here. Derek Barnes looks like he's down. So we've had Branch go down. Now Barnes. So they work on him. Back after this. So Derek Barnes, unlike Branch, able to walk off under his own power. Meanwhile, it's second down and goal eight and a half to go in the third. Trying to culminate what would be an 86-yard drive. A.J. Dillon in the backfield out of the pistol. Now side by side. Play fake, pass, wide open, touchdown, Christian Watson. 27-9, they're going to keep the offense out there to try to make it what would be a two-position game, albeit they'd need 8 plus 8 to make it 27 to 11. Going for 2. Yeah, watch Watson. A little miscommunication there from the Detroit defenders. Made it pretty easy for Love. Yes. Ooh, hello? Oh, boy. So a two-point conversion. They converted one last week against New Orleans, and it led them to a situation where all they needed was an extra point after a touchdown to win the game, which they did. And that pass caught back in the end zone. Jaden Reed. Well, well, well. Can they do it again? I mean, down big last week. Yep. Down huge opening night back in 2018. 20 yards on a touchdown. First player in his first three games with Detroit rushing two decents. Barry Sanders. 1989. Back 34 seasons. So Detroit now will start from the 25-yard line. Already their fourth drive. Two have culminated in touchdowns. Short drop. Throw is one-handed, and that is Josh Reynolds pulling it in. So that connection that started with the Rams seven years ago, continuing in Detroit. Remember, Jire Alexander out of this game. So you've got some backup corners. Eric Stokes hasn't played all year. So you're working on some backups. Not bad coverage, but he never locates the football. Go back to what Al said, the relationship with Goff and Reynolds going back to their Rams days. He's got built-in natural chemistry. That time he puts it out there, and somehow Josh Reynolds comes down with that football. Final minute of the quarter. Little razzle-dazzle. Raymond. Tons of room. Kalief Raymond down the sideline. He goes deep into Green Bay territory. Rudy Ford finally knocks him down. And they'll spot the ball inside the 10-yard line. Gives helping to lead the way. 40 yards on that play. 194 yards already for Detroit. and 9 for Green Bay. The backside of that Green Bay defense out of position makes it easy for Jerry Goff to stand in the way there and pick up a nice block. Good blocks downfield by the receivers. Great call by Ben Johnson again. Well, for Green Bay, it's kind of shades of last Sunday. First quarter, 14-3. Detroit back from Green Bay right after the nine-yard line. Quick toss from the outside. and finding his way to the four-yard line to Sam Laporta. It's just a motion without Green Bay following him out there. So they had extra blockers out front. You move the tight end and you get a couple out in front. Wright's out there. He was moving in motion. St. Brown. Very creative offense. Ben Johnson again recognizes one of the great offensive minds in this league. He's having a good night so far tonight. Second and goal. Pass to the end zone. It's incomplete. That was Reynolds. Reynolds started to stumble a little bit. He didn't get his footing completely. Play call being sent in by Ben Johnson, the Lions offensive coordinator. Has interviewed for a couple of head coaching jobs, but has remained there probably in a head coaching position before, unfortunately. I think with all the quarterbacks coming out, a lot of High-profile quarterbacks coming out next year. Drake May at North Carolina, Caleb Williams at USC to name just a couple. He's going to become, I think, one of the hottest names with the year the Lions are expected to have offensively. Detroit running its 23rd play right here. Josh spins away and then just finally fires it out of bounds. Flag is down, only the second one tonight. Here's Allen Eck. Crowd likes abuse. It's against the Lions. Olding. The 60-off. Ten-yard counter. Good play. Good play. So Green Bay was going to be fourth and goal if you decline it. Instead, they'll take the yardage and make it third down and goal. I'm a bit surprised by that. Class. It's someone interesting goal, yeah. Glasgow 60. They end up calling the hold, but Rashawn Gary, look at him. Nice job of getting a push against Taylor Decker. We've talked so much about Aiden Hutchison. Another Michigan man here, Rashawn Gary, making his presence felt. It's good to see him healthy coming back from that ACL that he had week nine a year ago. It's the third down and goal. You've got Montgomery split all the way to the left top of the screen. Goff under pressure, fires, and it's incomplete. Tended for Marvin Jones, and now it's fourth and goal. Field goal is still pretty much a chip shot, but 10 yards longer than it would have been had they declined the penalty. Good job sinking in coverage. Just rushed three, dropped eight. Forced everything in front, even if he catches that ball. He's well short. Good job by the Packers. I thought they might give up another touchdown there. They're at least able to stop him there and force his field goal. 17-3. He's a good job of anticipating getting downhill by Walker. He's going to have to make a ton of tackles. Remember, their leader, Campbell, is not playing tonight. You see McDuffie in there. He's more of a special teams guy. It puts more on Clay Walker. Good job of meeting him right in the hole. Walker trying to keep his emotions in check. this. He's the only guy in the league that have ejected twice last year. Second and goal. Big hole. Left side. In for the touchdown. David Montgomery. The Detroit Lions that time. With Taylor Decker. He was questionable coming into the game whether he would play or not. Leading the way. Eight plays. 55 yards in a little over four minutes. Watch him get his body turned on the edge here. And then you see that fast motion that everybody in the league is using, that turbo motion with the tight end who uses his speed, then to be able to get a kickout block with Laporta and Brock Wright, and a nice job, and another nice drive by this Detroit Lion offense. Rodney Patterson. Boots it through for point number 14, 254 left in the opening quarter over the last 30 years. A yard in. Tishon Nixon. Up to the 21-yard line he goes. What's amazing is a franchise to have two quarterbacks at that level over three decades. It's almost unheard of. Yeah. I mean, Indianapolis thought maybe they would go in that direction with Peyton Manning. Yeah. And then he got hurt. Andrew Luck. But that didn't last that long. But this was off the charts. I mean, two unanimous first ballot Hall of Famers, in effect. I liked your comparison pregame. You were talking about a little baseball comparison. 21-yard line. This is A.J. Dillon. We were talking before the game, Kirk and I, about, you know, can we think of a parallel? I mean, you'd have to go back all the way to two guys. One guy succeeds the other. Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle would be, I mean, that's the top of that line. In terms of, you know, DiMaggio, fantastic career. Here comes the kid out of Oklahoma, Mantle. The career was just as good. That's how far back you have to go in a different sport. Right. You try to think of a comparison. There are comparisons, but that to me is, that's the A grade. Dylan again. And it's interesting, too, you look at Jordan Love. So he's the next guy up. Who was the next guy up after Mickey Mantle? It was Bobby Mercer. Came out of Oklahoma like Mickey. Bobby had a very fine career, but, I mean, the other two guys are over the top. But that's what Jordan Love is facing. Exactly. You know, stepping into this environment and the expectations of what Brett started and, of course, what Aaron Rodgers went on to do and maybe even raised the bar with his performance. Right. Third down and three. That's right. It's over the middle. Too high. Almost picked and incomplete. Tended for Romeo Dobbs. So a sputtering, stuttering start for Green Bay. Hayden Hutchison way off to the outside to create one-on-one opportunities. Back to the inside. He's tackle working. Zach Tom to try to get out there to try to defeat Hutchison, but it opens up, and right now Detroit, talk about the line of scrimmage on both sides and Detroit early in this game winning it on both, getting good pressure on Jordan Love and his dropbacks. Whelan's kick floating over, fair catch goal form made by Raymond at the 25-yard line, and we will be back at Lambeau in 30 seconds. Give me your son. Give me your son. Back at Lambeau, 14-3. The Lions on top. Montgomery is carrying the ball eight times. Deep again, wide open, making the grab and taking it. It is St. Brown. Alman Ross, St. Brown for 24 yards. So just like that, 35-24. Lambeau leaped right into the arms of some Lions fans. and Detroit takes the lead. Jared Goff telling us the difference with him is not so much the turnovers but how he responds to the turnovers. Look at the coverage right here by Green Bay and look what happens to the coverage with Green Bay. A little slip, man-to-man, goes down, an easy read. That was Douglas there who was locked up on St. Brown. But a really nice job there of responding from that interception by Jared Goff. St. Brown, 100-yard game last week. That kick is just good off the foot of Riley Patterson. So back comes Goff after the pick. Two long passes into the end zone. They go, and Detroit leads 7-3. They've taken that to a new level now. Detroit, bottom right, trying to get involved in it. A lot of Lions fans here tonight. He's on Nixon. Takes it at the goal line. Good return man. Take care of him though at the 20-yard line. And there Chase Lucas making the tackle. So Jordan Love The one issue he had this year is completion percentages only a little bit over 50 A lot of that has to do with a couple things. Number one, he hasn't had Christian Watson out there. They've thrown the ball downfield a lot this year. And I think with all the youth on the perimeter, they're still trying to find that rhythm with a new quarterback. as Watson, number nine, second year out of North Dakota State. Been a really good rookie season. Look out, and he gets swallowed up back at the 13-yard line. Isaiah Buggs roaring in to take him down. Isaiah Buggs is known for his power, but he's got some quicks to go with it. They max protect. They've got a couple tight ends that are in to try to help out, but he just bull rushes right through the middle of Royce Newman and Josh Myers in the interior. I'll tell you, I don't know how Love held on to that football with Buggs trying to knock that away from him. Buggs in his fifth season, but it's only his second career sack. Second and 16. A.J. Dillon is the back. He flares that pass. He's broken up. Intended there for Dobbs, and it's Jerry Jacobs covering on the play, making it third down and 16 for the Packers. You know, with Jordan Love, you know, you see these young quarterbacks are seeing a few of them play this year already. There's that debate about is it better to sit around for a couple years and get ready. In his case, he had a chance to learn from a future Hall of Famer in Aaron Rodgers. And he talked about how much he learned from him, his focus, and paying attention to detail in his prep work and his film study. And he said probably the greatest thing that I took away from him was just his consistency with his daily prep. What an opportunity, really, for him those last three years. Third and 16. Deep, deep drop. Everybody covered. Flag is down. Pass is incomplete. And we'll hear from the first time tonight from Allen Eck, the referee. Rolling on the field. It's a mixed-way pass. And the right guard, John Runyon, already saw Hutchison go by him. Number 76, Auburn. The penalty is declined. Now he's limping off the field. And a tough start for him. Remember, they're minus David Bakhtiari, their left tackle who went on injured reserve today. Elton Jenkins, the left guard, is also out. You're all ready. I mean, that's what's been impressive. They've been able to overcome that in two of their three games. And I hate to see John Runyon, fourth-year man out of Michigan, now limping off. I mean, so many teams have that same situation going on right now. That offensive line and Whelan's kick, that came after the whistle had stopped play. Remember, penalties hurt this Green Bay team last week in those first three quarters before the big comeback. They're going to push him back five more yards. False start. 55 off the line. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. 5-0. goes back to the nine. I believe Raymond sets up at his own 40. And that is whatever that is. Here's a flag. Tended for Dobbs. Jacobs covering on the play. Three seconds. Pass it occurred. Number 43. in defense. The ball will be placed in the final foul. Dobbs had that big catch last week. It ended up being the game-winning touchdown. Look how tight that coverage is. I think you can see what Jacobs is saying. I mean, he was tight on his coverage. It was maybe at the very end of that route. But he's frustrated. He thought he was in his pocket. There's nothing to do here but throw a Hail Mary assuming he has more than two and a half seconds. Final play of the half barring the defensive foul. Love. Don't forget about it. He's going to get sacked. Going to take more yardage off their totem. And boy, oh boy, oh boy. A sound you don't hear here. It's hard to throw a Hail Mary when you need a little bit of time and Harris goes right by Rasheed Walker. Look at Hutchison, the energy he brings to this defense. 27-3, Detroit at the break. State Farm halftime show coming right up. Players, after their first two weeks, had the one sack and answered a lot of questions from their local media. What's wrong? Getting pressure, why can't you come up with a sack? Seven last week and then four here in this first half. Nixon. A yard into the end zone. Flag is thrown. So a good run back. But you know what that normally means. And all the Lions, of course, are pointing in a westerly direction. Nixon hobbles off. Get the call here from Allen. Allen. 89. 10-yard penalty from Spotify. Back to go moments ago. And moments ago, Kaylee talked to Matt LaFleur. Matt, what adjustments do you need to make to protect Jordan Love? Well, we've got to block a hell of a lot better. They've won the line of scrimmage, both sides of the ball. And, I mean, it's very humbling and embarrassing right now. What did you tell your team at the half? I said we've got to be able to look each other in the eye, man-to-man, and give it up for one another this whole second half. I want to see this team fight. Thank you, Coach. well not much more need be said from the 14 yard line play action pressure on but the pass is caught and taken down to the 20 yard line there is Tucker Kraft number 2 tight end three rookie tight ends you can feel that energy and you can't blame Matt LaFleur feeling embarrassed and frustrated and trying to come up with answers. We talked near the end of the first half. What do you do when you're losing the line of scrimmage as badly on offense? And one of the things right there, moving that launch point, move the pocket around, try to give your quarterback a chance to get away from that pressure. On the ground, fighting, comes up a yard shy. Aaron Jones working his way back from that hamstring injury. Never a good sign when a coach refers to, it's embarrassing. I think Sean Payton may have said that last week in Miami, too. That was really a rough afternoon for Denver. But, you know, this first half, we're just not used to it. We were all talking at halftime. When was the last time this crowd dealt with something like this? Ever? I mean, back pre-Brett Favre? Yeah, maybe in the late 80s probably. Yeah. Third and one. and that is going to be caught for a first down Romeo and Dobbs and that's Green Bay's fourth first down and creates an uproarious situation in the stands Kaylee well Al Dan Campbell told me his biggest concern right now is that his team won't come out with the same energy that got them this 24 point lead he told me I saw that Packers game last week I saw them come back down 17 we cannot let them do that right now He doesn't want to see any penalties from his team. He wants to see more discipline and more action from his run game. Coaching a 60-minute game, as they all do. That's caught wide open. All of a sudden, Watson. And finally, a big play from the Packers. 25 yards. They're playing with two safeties deep. And you'll see movement here and here. And then Dobbs does a good job of just kind of clearing it out. Opening up a nice throwing lane there. but you saw the pressure by McNeil again. Good job of waiting to the last possible moment until he got rid of this football once. Watson cleared over the middle there for a nice game. A little motion here. Pass out with a flat. Nothing. Nothing doing. A little fun with a flag thrown. Crunching Jones as he made the catch. That would have been a two-yard gain. I think we used to hands to face. Number 97 defense. Five-round penalty. That's Hutchinson. Right near the end of his move towards the quarterback, he got his hands into the face of Zach Tom. Remember he is a guy that's going to go beyond the whistle. He just pushes. And there at the very end, it was really close. I don't think he cared for that at all. It looked like he got the top of the shoulder pad. And then as he followed through, maybe raised the face mask. But the referee saw it and threw the flag. Dillon is the back Send him into the pattern Goes the other way And that pass is thrown out of bounds Romeo Dobbs The intended receiver It'll be second and ten Aaron Glenn with a nice lead Against the floor What he's trying to do is keep his safeties back He's not going to give up an easy home run He wants to avoid some man-to-man coverage without the safeties back there. Make Green Bay have to either run the football or hit their short to intermediate throws. Make them go the long way and eat some clock. Glenn, a defensive back in his years. Played for Belichick and Parshels. Pretty good combo. He's had five head coaching interviews over the last couple of years. But hasn't hit the home run yet. Jones trying to hit a home run on that run. is wiped out out of bounds and takes a bunch of people on the sideline with him. He had a Rasheed Walker block flag down. Could have been a nine-yard gain right there. You've got this Brian Branch who needs the attention. Personal foul, unnecessary roughness, number 34, the defense. A 15-yard penalty would be enforced at the end of the run. Automatic. It's on Alex Angeloni. What? He uses his helmet here. He lowers his helmet is the call. He's inbounds. He lowers. Terry, can you come in on this? His helmet here? Is that what they're calling? Yeah, Kirk, that's the only thing he can call is use of helmet, lowering his helmet to make forceful contact. I don't think it is. It looks to me like he's leading with his shoulder, and that helmet contact's incidental. I do not believe this is a foul. They called it anyway. Meanwhile, Branch was down. Still down. Here's how he got hurt. Before he almost, as he simultaneously gets hit there by Reed, if he stepped on his foot, but he immediately went down. If you're Lions fans, you're holding your breath. This rookie has been a great pickup for Detroit. So versatile. So tough. Couldn't have a better debut as a pro picking off Patrick Mahomes on opening night and taking it all the way in. So, what a good sign as he comes hobbling off the field. Second round pick out of Alabama. See if anything happens before the contact. See right away reaching down to that right leg. So the rookie goes to the bench. Meanwhile, this drive started back at the 14-yard line. They've now advanced to the A-team. Penalties have helped as well. Off play action. Time. Sidearm throw. Juggled. Caught. But nothing doing there. Tucker Crabb makes the catch. And that'll be second and 11 after a loss of one. Will Harrison in on the... Look at that. He is hit as he throws that football and still put it on a line accurately. And Laporte, of course, his eyes started to look at McDuffie there. The linebacker closing in on him. Gary got to him late. Gary had three sacks last week. Coming back from an ACL mid-year last year. Goff fires. That's caught. And dancing his way for a first down. And more. Monroe St. Brown broke away from Darnell Savage, and that nets him the first down on the gain of 14. Now they brought the linebacker this time. They showed pressure by Quay Walker, 7. that ended up bringing Wilson. And any time you can get St. Brown matched up underneath, he's going to win. This time that he sensed that blitz, Walker moved to the outside, the throw went back to the inside, and St. Brown makes a lot of his living there in the middle along with the big tight end, Laporta. Go five wide on this set. Goff avoids that sack fires, reaching up pulling it in La Porto man, marker coverage so Goff does the escape job, goes against the grain, gets his man again, Goff is not a dual threat guy but he's athletic enough to get away from this and keep his eyes downfield and the tight end this time works to find that opening Really good job of helping the quarterback. He's running his route. He looks back and sees it. Now he just looks through grass. Where can I get open? Gets away from the linebacker, Walker, and great recognition again by golf to locate him. Two-minute warning upcoming. We warned you. Two minutes to the half. Detroit 24 and Green Bay 3. Two minutes to halftime. First down here from the 35-yard line. Through the middle. Another big run. First down, 8 of 12. David Montgomery, 14 carries, 52 yards, two touchdowns tonight for him. Again, watch the offensive line and the blocking angles. Look how they move people off the line of scrimmage and open up these holes. You throw in the tight ends with Laporte and Brock Wright working from side to side. a lot of times in motion. Again, Ben Johnson designing plays to give this offensive line to work those angles and to be able to get these backs to that second level running downhill. Gibbs. To the 19, he goes. It's bad enough you're down 24-3, right? You have, what, a negative two yards still, whatever you said? Well, yeah, they picked up some garbage. You know, it's obviously not a great night. And they're just body-blowing you. You know, I mean, it's even more challenging emotionally when you get hit at the line of scrimmage. This is a first-half skunking. Yeah. Second and seven. Montgomery, he's tackled there. Third down. Now let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS, and it's the Lions defense. You know, you'd think the way they're pressuring, they've been blitzing all night, and Aaron Glenn is not. Why should he? Look at that pressure rate at 46%. Hutchinson has been all over the place getting into that backfield. Aleem McNeil has been in that backfield. And every one of the offensive linemen has struggled. You'd think it'd be coming from the left side, but it's not Because this defensive pressure and the way that Aaron Glenn has been able to design this plan, they've attacked from all over the place, having their way of things. You know, it's interesting. Green Bay, they're going to call a timeout here. I was thinking, you know, they're kind of in a no-man's landing. You want to get the hell off the field and back into the locker room. So you're playing with a little bit of fire here by letting them have the extra time. third and six and falling down that time and dropping to his knees and the pass is incomplete. So it's fourth down and six and the field goal unit comes back in. One guy who's competing his tail off is 52, Rashawn Gary. He has been relentless in his own right, especially on these third downs going up against Decker and winning that battle, getting into the backfield. He's going to have to go through the highs and the lows. Last week was symbolic of where he is. Three quarters of a lot of frustrating moments and one quarter of euphoria where they came back and won the game. It's going to be that kind of year, I think, for Green Bay. A lot of ups and downs growing with him at quarterback. Third down and five. One other note about Aaron Rodgers. I happened to see him last week for a while. He's doing well. Rehab doing well. All things considered. had the Achilles surgery. He had posted it on a site about, hey, don't count me out for the rest of the year. Who knows? With him, anything can happen. I just love to hear that his spirit and his heart, he's talking about coming back this year, let alone what he wants to do next year. Right. I just wonder where the Jets would be record-wise if he were somehow miraculously even able to even think about that as a possibility. what would be the point if they're sitting there at a he's under the care of Dr. Neal who's the best and as Neal once said you never want to win an argument with your short. All that speed and everywhere. Not if you're a Bronco fan. That's true. Fourth and three. Goff. Complete. It's St. Brown. Come on, St. Brown. And that will put a complete bow on this baby. How about Ragnow, who's just a leader up front? Kind of directing traffic up there. You got seven. You got seven. You guys got seven. Just taking command. and looked back at Goff. He and Goff were on the same page. And just a little thing that I think it tells you a lot about the communication that's going on up front there with him on the lead. Haven't eaten much from St. Brown. There's a terrific receiver, 5 for 56. Dan Campbell. This team's now on 11 in their last 14. Quick little acknowledgement there amongst the coaches. You buying in? Oh, am I buying in? I don't know. I am. I am. Oh, you're buying into Detroit. I thought you meant buying into the fly-by knowledge. I got you, man. I'm buying into Detroit, definitely. All right, don't go anywhere. Carissa's got the gang rounded up. JCPenney postgame show coming up after these messages. It's really about the coverage downfield and a relentless effort and attitude here and not giving up by Carl Brooks. Nice job of just... You never know when you can get there, right? This is marrying up. Good coverage downfield. You see St. Brown. It's easy to see that break free, but underneath coverage by Savage took that away, So nothing golf could do other than try to throw that one away. 10-yard sack, third and 15 run a draw here. And to the 26-yard line, Gibbs tackled by Preston. Smith and Green Bay ready to get the ball back. Keep in mind, their top two corners are out of this defense for Green Bay. Stokes, of course, not playing Eric Stokes. Jair Alexander unable to go and trying to hold up with some backup corners. Jack Fox his punting average since he came into the league in 2020 is number one in the league over that period of time but this is a short one that will roll dead inside the 35 yard line so a short kick we're in the final minute of the third quarter after a 39 yard boot the Meyer Theater. Green Bay, Wisconsin. Look at that. First 22 plays minus one yard tonight. Last 15. Triple digits. And Detroit first half opposite. 284 in the first half in the third quarter. 17. Yep. Packers trying to build on that long drive now. 16 minutes left in the game. Aaron Jones. The fourth, second down. Well, it's that time of the month in October when you see up in the sky what they call the harvest. There it is, the harvest moon. Big, bright harvest moon. Every time I see that, I keep thinking of our buddy Keith Jackson, the late grape, going, I want to tell you what, that's a possum hunting moon right there. I love that. We'll be out hunting possum. Oh, without a doubt. Second and seven. Catch made. First down. 47-yard line. Romeo Dobbs. Chava getting the ball out of his hands. Again, they've come up with answers. Move in the pocket. Ball out quickly. Trying to go quickly here, but they're going to run out of time. Unless, they say, the clock didn't go to triple zeros. And Ningo, a bomb to Jalen Reed. To the four-yard line, he goes. Jaden Reed, will they catch 45 yards? That clock was at triple zeros. Snap was good, pass was great. And Green Bay envisions when he starts the fourth quarter. 27-11, into three. And we're going to go after the first play and show you the play at the end of the third quarter. And there's always something. And you'll see it in a second hit. Meanwhile, first and goal after that 44-yard reception to Reed. From the nine. Play clock at four. Love throws and into the end zone it is Jaden Reed who is there but Jacobs covering on the play no good second down and goal this is very very close he gets that ball in there obviously he's not able to get his feet down a heck of a throw to give him a chance they were man to man on the outside Jerry Jacobs matched up against a rookie. Pretty tight coverage there. Even in college, not good. He was on the truck with the first foot. Meanwhile, Branch is back in the game. Bottom of the screen, covering the slot. Second and goal. Love's going to keep it himself. Touchdown, Green Bay. Nine yards. And that didn't take long. Time of possession, a minute and two. And they go 66 yards. You've got to respect Jordan Love's feet. I mean, he's proven that. The linebackers here, you see 55, Barnes. His head's already on his swivel looking for coverage. The board sets them up to go for seven. And they cash in here. 34-17. DeTrois. Walker being talked to about that leaping foul, which is very costly. Green Bay now down by 17. Nixon will take it out of the end zone. Nice stop there. Tripped up at about the 15-yard line. Tackle made by Craig Reynolds. Standings right now. So Packers, in all likelihood, will go to 2-2. Lions will go to 3-1. Vikings and Bears. winless at this point. Oh my. Yeah, it's been incredible to see what's happened to the Vikings and the Bears. Vikings had some tough matchups. It's a big win with the Lions. They moved to 3-1. This franchise has only had two 10-win seasons over the last 20 years. So success very new to them in this new culture of Dan Campbell. No question. Most of the, a good part of the crowd has stayed, a couple of reasons actually. sometimes in a blowout situation you leave early but the crowd now there are eight home games and what they call the Milwaukee group or the Southern Wisconsin group this is one of their two games as the catch is made here by Romeo play those games in Milwaukee you let those people on that season ticket list have priority for two games so you got a lot of people who only get to a couple of games a year also another reason, a lot of Detroit fans I can't say there's a lot of blue. And it's a nice night. Love hopping around. And just fires that one away and almost had it picked off. I think Detroit fans are almost thinking this is too good to be true. We're not trying to jinx them or anything like that. We're not getting ahead of ourselves. But there's just a lot to like with this young team. And you start to look at them. It's all about who's going to be able to stay healthy. They're going to have to stay healthy like every team in the NFL. But you look at their schedule and the way it works out these next few weeks. If Carolina, they're at Tampa, they're at Baltimore, Vegas, Rams, Bears, and they have a bye. This is a legitimate shot. They could get on a little bit of a run. No doubt. It's caught to the 40. Aguero making the grab right there. And we should mention, not just for tonight, but big picture, to see Brian Branch come back after he was carted off was significant. He's out there now, so very good news. Third and one. Yeah, Branch is the guy. He's got that mouthpiece. No, there it is. You know, I watched the opening game this year. I said, what is that, a binky? A pacifier? Well, you're like, he's a rookie. He's got a binky. Right. Four and a half. It's a pacifier. And that is wrestled for and caught. Moritore somehow, someway made a beautiful grab last week as well for 35 yards. The two-ray goes over top, and Jerry Jacobs somehow pulls that ball away from him and stays inbounds for a completion. Matt LaFleur said that two-rays, because a young group of receivers, It's been a very important call to this offense. To the 14, Jason Weed. And, uh-oh, there is Branch who had come back into the game, and now he's down again. They took him back on a cart, checked him out, came back in, but now... While you appreciate the toughness of trying to battle through that, you've got to be thinking about the big picture, trying to keep him healthy for the long haul. work on him with 418 left in the fourth To his left has that picked off in the five-yard line Jerry Jacobs and run out of the 18 So second pick tonight coming with four minutes to go Pretty much putting putting a bow on it Sometimes when you have an athletic quarterback that can create because of the pressure sometimes receivers they start to get used to having to bail and having to get off of a route. That's what happens here. He's going to work from the left, watch him field it all of a sudden. Okay, I've got to help. I've got to help my guy out. He starts to go into scramble mode, and Love ends up just getting the ball out of his hands because he thinks he's got an opening. So he worked from the right back to the left. Look at him. He starts to go, hey, get me in the corner. And the ball's already been released by Love for the interception. Jacobs played at Arkansas, third year in the league. Played 28 games prior tonight with one pick. Second of his career right there. He got up to a slow jog, but it looks like they're trying to do everything they can to support him here. Either that or he went to Lourdes. Third and 21. Deep drop pass along the sideline. Hold in. Romeo Dobbs. officials checking with each other catch is good so it's going to be fourth and six so they needed 21 and got 15 now look at Hutchinson before the snap doing his best Myles Garrett impersonation here and then he ends up coming actually gets picked up good job, one of the better jobs this offensive line has done all night on a third down but just too many yards to make up after that loss yeah that backward pass killed him Whelan's fifth punt of the night. Fielded at the 15-yard line by Raymond. Flagged down. A couple of them, in fact, on either side of the field. With 4.53 left in the third. I tell you what, he went to the Ed Hockley School of Biceps building, didn't he? I think everybody's getting in line. Wow. Terry is. Leaning mean out there, isn't he? Yeah, I'm telling you. So you got two flags here, so kind of two separate fouls. During the return, holding number 42 of the receiving team. Ten-yard penalty from his father foul. First down, Detroit. Time out. Okay. They're throwing 11-yard line. Montgomery. To the 14 he goes. Now, one of the things that has been impressive with Detroit is with the injury to Taylor Decker. They had moved Panay Sewell from the right side, right tackle over to left tackle. And I was talking to Big Whit, Andrew Whitworth, before the game. He said, man, I don't know if people understand how challenging that is. It's like asking you to, all of a sudden, you've never worked as a left-handed layup to try to go out and play left-handed in basketball. I mean, it's complete reverse of what he's used to doing on the right side. So he held up for a couple weeks. Decker's back, and now he's back to his familiar right side. So the number one pick out of Oregon in 21. Coming up a little short is Montgomery again. So it's third and two, down to four minutes left in the third. Detroit reminds me of one of those teams when the draft comes around and the fans are dressed up and they've got their uniforms on and they say with the first round they select Panay Sewell. It's like, what? They want to hear a quarterback or a receiver. but the Lions have done that with Decker, Sewell, Ragnow. They have three first-rounders on that offensive line and a big reason they're one of the top offensive lines in this league. Yardage 80-9 for Green Bay, the reverse of the first half. Meanwhile, they do pick up the first down, only needed a couple, and that's Gibbs making the catch along the sideline, tackled by Walker, moving the sticks. Yeah, they move him in motion. Thought they might have a defender go with him, But because the corner doesn't run with him, they know that it's going to be a little bit softer in coverage. See the movement there? Then he goes back out. The linebacker has a long way to go. So good pre-snap recognition by Goff with the motion. Gets him back out there to the flat. And there's no way Walker can stop him from picking up the yards. Montgomery. Chewing up ground yardage. and, you know, at this point, plenty of time left in the game. You might as well take as much time off the clock as you can. That's a great point. I think we're all watching this Lions team, and we see a talented team with Dan Campbell up and coming, but there's still lots of inexperience. One of the things that Dan Campbell's trying to teach his team is about playing as a leader, playing with success, holding on to leads, closing out games. Second down, five. Play action. Doff slides. Zach. Carl Brooks. Doff buying, Conk sliding away. And Brooks, a rookie out of Bowling Green, six-round pick. Jonah Jackson. You want to see perfect technique. Watch 77 right here. The double team, and then you'll see him work up to the second level. 77 gets up right there on that linebacker, Isaiah McDuffie. That is textbook. And now you start to see a big back in Montgomery start to wear on this defense in the second half, the mix of he and Gibbs back and forth. Gibbs' turn. He's got it. Short. Third down two. Lucas Van Ness, a rookie from Iowa, makes the stop. He was their number one pick. Big third and two for that Packer defense here. Gibbs got it. Inside the 49-yard. Went in behind Decker and Jonas Jackson. It's fun to watch these guys. It's time on that left side. See as they come off the ball. Climbing up. There's nobody there over the left guard. Jonah Jackson. and he's easy there to get up to the backer, Walker. I tell you, people will be surprised if you don't know enough yet about Gibbs as a rookie. He is a physical runner, even though he doesn't have the size of Montgomery. These days you don't see a lot of running backs drafted in the first round. Top time. Whoa, reaching out, making the grab. Josh Reynolds, great catch. Rooting forward with the coverage. diving makes it. Again, I can't say enough about Ben Johnson changing his mode. Aggressive mindset. Great job by Reynolds. Throw is low and away from the defender. He's able to turn his body. But that's another first and ten play action pass with Packers coming downhill trying to stop that running game and that big offensive line. Ben Johnson one step ahead of him with that play action call. Ten and a half left in regulation. Montgomery. You know, Kirk, not that I have to tell you, you know, another thing Doff is really great at, ball handling. Mechanics are flawless. Sets up the play action perfectly. And I think that's part of his maturation, you know, being here now for a few years, second year in this scheme. I think when you talk with Ben Johnson, you talk to Dan Campbell, they say that he's a different guy today than he was with the Rams because there's more on him. He's got to worry about protections. He's under center a lot with the run game and getting to the right checks. And then, as you say, the mechanics with that play-action game, which is a big part of this offense. Yeah, plays out of the stakes beautifully, second and seven. Nothing happening there. They probe the middle. Go nowhere. Clay Walker in on the mix. Third down. That's a play by the rookie, Colby Wooden. Watch him work right here, able to bounce off, finally get some penetration. Use a little swim technique and quickness. That's what he was known for his days as an Auburn Tiger. Has the size, but that time uses his quickness. Third down and nine. Keep it on the ground. And taking it to the 11. so about two yards shy gives that time going back and forth with these guys gives eight carries 40 yards Montgomery 78 yards but that aggressive mindset right they think behind that offensive line hope for some positive yards and now they get close enough to feel that they want to go for it here with his ten-point lead with eight and a half to go in the game trying to make it 34 17 Trying to make it a three-possession score. Then get into the end zone. Line up anyway to go for it. Trying to draw them offside. Play clock at two. Yep, that's all they were doing. Trying to draw them offside. And now they'll bring in the field goal group. It's a win for Green Bay. You know, you've got to get two touchdowns, obviously. Yeah. They come up with a stop. Detroit was moving the ball right down the field. Right. 17 puts it. Yeah. Almost for sure out of reach. Yeah. 13. Got a shot. Yeah. Yeah. So, Rodney Patterson will attempt a short field goal. He's made two tonight from 33. And 37. This one will be about 30 yards. Jack Fox to hold it. From 30. Perfect. 8-10 left. Unforced like conduct, number 7 in the defense. The running forward is jumping over the line. He's more than one yard off the line. The penalty will get towards half the distance to the goal from the previous five. Automatic first down. Oh, baby. I mean, think about that. So the field goal would have made it 30-17. Meanwhile, here it is again. You heard Eck talking about it. Here's the foul on Walker. But you talk about a late flag. The Packer return team had already come out, and the Lions kickoff team was ready to come out. And, Terry, you could see the officials come together. As Al said, it came very late, but they made the right call. It is clearly a foul. It's unsportsmanlike conduct for a player more than a yard to run up and leap across the line, which is exactly what he did on that play. It's 15 yards, in this case half the distance, an automatic first down. Right, and they take the three points off the board, but now they're thinking about seven, obviously. First and goal, and can chew up some clock, should they prefer as well. Montgomery sliding to the three. And it's Quay Walker, the guy that's worked so hard on, you know, he's talked about meditation, talked about maturing, and being the guy that they can count on, And a guy that makes better decisions. You mentioned kicked out of a couple games last year. He's worked very hard on that part of his game. He's been in on a ton of tackles and assists tonight. Well into double figures. And yet that was a killer. Unless they can stop him here and hold him to another field goal. Halfway through the quarter. Second down and goal. And stuffed in the backfield is Montgomery. To the defense with T.J. Slayton there trying to hold them off. They're doing what they can up front. Boy, they have played so differently. Getting penetration and making great plays. 93 right here. We've seen Slayton make plays. Wooten. Wyatt, 95, is there to help out. It's a third and goal. Another huge play for the Green Bay defense. Trying to keep it a two-possession lead. Play clock at three. Ball is handed off and stopped at the one-yard line is David Montgomery. Well, they lined up to go for it, Al, right, when it was fourth and three. He worked the clock down. Dan Campbell called the timeout. Now with his offensive line, the way you saw Montgomery work it all the way down to the one-yard line, here they go. They're bringing out the unit to go for it. Yeah, I mean, worst-case basis, you don't get it. I mean, Green Bay's got about a 99-yard field. Yeah, and now you're down to six minutes. Fourth and goal. Hands it off and into the end zone. Goes Montgomery. David Montgomery has carried the ball 26 times. 384 yards tonight. They had three tight ends to the right. They went right behind the right guard. Glasgow and, of course, Sewell. Watch Sewell turn his body away from the hole to open that hole up. actually takes Walker with him, the linebacker, so he takes two, and Glasgow turns his body the other way and opens that hole just nicely on the right side, and Montgomery easily gets in. So an extra point of some significance. If he misses it, it's still a two-possession game, but he doesn't. So it's a three-score game. Again, the Walker penalty takes the field goal. You rush three. Everybody's looking at the receivers out on the perimeter. Nobody there to account for Jordan Love, and he will take that gladly for the touchdown. So they went for two, of course, to make it a two-possession game. They need eight plus eight, so here's that first eight that they need. Jones is the back. Love's going to keep it. Can he get in? He is short. John Kaminsky saves it. Keeps it at two possessions. Eight seconds into the fourth at 27-17. Meanwhile, as we take a look at Loves... I thought he had the corner. I thought he had the corner, but he reaches. He's short. His knee's down. He's down, right. It's a heck of a job fighting through that block to make that play. Pretty clear there. Knee goes first. Stop it there. He's down there. Yeah. He's down pretty clearly. That's a great play. Meanwhile, we've got to go back to the end of the third quarter. Terry, we're going to bring you in. Terry McCauley, watch the clock at the end of the third quarter. Here it is right now. Terry? Yeah, the clock clearly hit zero before the ball snapped, and it's not treated like the play clock where there's somewhat of delay between shutting it down for a delay of game. Once the game clock hits zero, it's over. It should be shut down on the field by the officials. Final note, it's not a reviewable play. They could not go back and fix that. Terry, that's such a great point because a lot of times you'll see the play clock goes to zero, but the officials give them that hand-on-one second or whatever happens. But Terry's so right about when the game clock goes to 0-0-0, period. No wiggle room. And they get away with it and capitalize. They get a rare one-on-one opportunity, and it's a perfect throw and a great catch. Compared to what they faced last week in the fourth quarter, this is no problem, right? Yeah, well. Different team. Yeah. But at least they made a game out of it. I mean, this place was dead. And it's a long way to go. I mean, to their credit, this game was over at 27-3 at half. It's kind of today's NFL. I mean, you know, it's a cliche to say no lead is safe, but you get close. Yeah, and again, I want to bring up the point we keep getting caught up in love in the offense, but it's been the defense the last couple weeks in these second halves that have given the Packers a chance to get their offense back out there to get them into the game. A little flip out in the flat, Montgomery. And he takes it for a game of close to nine. Second down and short. With Ben Johnson as the play caller, we keep talking about him as one of the elite play callers in the league. I think, you know, at 27-3 on the road, second half, you know, the play calling maybe. You start to work clock and be smart about just not making an error. Now you go back to that first half mode of being aggressive and trying to find matchups and trying to put points up on the board. Give it to Gibbs on a draw. And the rookie close to the first should have it, Quay Walker, making the tackle. I mean, this offensive line dominated the first half. And the Packers, in order for that not to happen again in this second half, they've been blitzing. They've been attacking the run with linebackers downhill. The safety's coming down. So when you're rolling the dice like that as a defense, you can create some opportunities for St. Brown and Laporta and these receivers up play action to get some one-on-one shots downfield. Almost perfect balance for that Lion offense. 26 runs, 25 passes. This will make it 26 and 26. And a first down here. David Montgomery takes the pass. picks up about 13. You've got two safeties deep, so they're taking away anything downfield, but you love to see the patience. I love what Goff told us. Rinse and repeat. If they give it to me underneath, I've got to just have completions and go through that. Go through that over and over again. Take the easy throws, and I love the first and 10 play action there. Just get your back out there in space in the flat. And Montgomery. Another good chunk here. Seven or eight. And into Green Bay territory. Frank Rack now, the center, along with him on the outside. Dobs. I was going to Hutchinson the other day. Remember, Detroit picks him in the first round. They have the number two pick, Jacksonville, head number one. He's a Detroit kid. Grew up. Their family's there, the whole thing. He said, oh, man, I don't want to go to Jacksonville. Nothing against Jacksonville. They want to go to Detroit. And part of him was like, heck, I want to be the first pick overall and really thought it was going that way. And then about a few weeks before, he found out that it was going to go a different direction. He was going to go to Detroit. He and his family were obviously fired up. Third down and seven. Love. Fired over the middle. Short. You know, the Lions fans, you see that they're finally, they feel like they're back. They're sick of hearing it. And, of course, they're the only team that's been in the league every year since the Super Bowl era that has not been to the Super Bowl. Now, Cleveland's been in the league as long as they have. But Cleveland was out of the league for three years when the Browns moved to Baltimore and then the new Browns came back in. 50-yard attempt coming up here for Anders Carlson. He'll try to get it to 34-20, which he does, a rookie. And you said the last time Detroit won a playoff game, I think you said it was the 91 season? Going back to Barry Sanders and Chris Spielman. Yeah, and these big shoulder pads. They routed the Cowboys 38-6. But... Talking over 30 years ago. Yeah, and look, they've only won... one postseason win in the last 65 seasons. Sheila Ford is running the team right now. Martha Ford, 98 years old, watching this game back in Detroit, one of the great, great women we've ever met. And the Ford family, you know, has had this team for years and years and years. Well, maybe the ship comes in. Sooner or later, the ship is going to come in. There's a lot to like about this team. And like I said, when you can win the line of scrimmage on both sides and you've got a veteran quarterback and you've got a lot of young skill on both sides of this football, it's a lot to like. All right, onside kick, obviously. Coming up here, they're going to need this one and a score and another onside kick and another score. Can it happen? Out of bounds, plays fly. and that of course means it is the Lions ball. Free kick out of bounds at number 17. The shooting team will take possession at the out of bounds spot. First down. Off to the nation's capital next week. Bears commanders on Thursday night football. That'll start week number five. We're wrapping up the opener of week number four right here. Lions ready to go to 3-1. Montgomery over 100 to the 31-yard line. He goes. It's 114 ground yards tonight for Montgomery and 20 receiving. Again, he's not going to let up. He's just going to get stronger. Rack now, the center, left guard, Jonah Jackson, 77 and 73, double team. Very nice. Then he shakes the linebacker, Quay Walker. And when you hit him, you better not hit him high. As big as Quay Walker is, he tries to get him up around the shoulder pads. He's too strong. And even though it's in the fourth quarter and he's at, what is it, you say, 30, 29 carries? Coming up on his 30th carry. Yeah. He does not slow down. He just gets stronger. He has 29. Gibbs has eight again 30 calculation in masculine and obviously in the last four years got a young guy you're bringing them along you're calling every play gonna manage the clock Montgomery you know you got Rogers for that period of time by the end of his career obviously you're multiple MVP winner you're going to go to the Hall of Fame first ballot I I mean, you know how to clock manage it as well. Yeah. I mean, when you have Aaron Rodgers, you essentially have the coordinator as a quarterback. Yeah. And now you've got a guy that made his fifth career start tonight. It's just a very different set of circumstances. And I think he's got a lot of talent. He's just a young guy that even though he's in his fourth year in this system, he needs reps. Montgomery patting his numbers. Boy, hard running again here. And Montgomery's going to close in on a triple-digit night here. Man, oh, man, he has been the workhorse. 27 carries coming off an injury, 97 yards. Kind of a throwback. One of these backs, the more he gets the ball, the better he gets into a rhythm, and the more he wears down that defense with that big offensive line. And we all kind of were shocked to see Jamal Williams and DeAndre Swift end up moving on. But they have definitely put themselves in a great spot with Montgomery and the rookie Gibbs as that new tandem in Detroit. Goff dropped. I just looked upfield. He's got great hands. But that time just let it go. Defense should be proud of this effort. The leadership. How about a Goff? It's so relevant to our conversation with him, handling adversity. The first drive, the interception, the third play. They came back with a couple touchdowns after that pick. How about the Green Bay scores a touchdown with no time left at the end of the third quarter on that bad call. Comes back with a 10-play scoring drive. Eats up almost nine minutes. We're talking about Jacobs with one pick until tonight, but he has 2-2 tonight. So double his career total. In one evening. They have different heroes now emerging every week on that Detroit defense. And this is without their starting safeties. Think about that. I mean, Kirby Joseph unable to go. We knew about C.J. Gardner-Johnson. Yeah, that's right. That was the big free agent pickup. Yeah, so the running game in this offensive line has been great to watch. And the ability to get great blocking angles. Ben Johnson puts him in a really good position. And I think you also got to give credit to David Montgomery. I mean, he's known as a power back, but he's shown some patience, some vision, and able to lower his shoulder and get those valuable yards. Three touchdowns on the ninth. There's our next-gen stats tonight. We see yards before contact, 121. This is powered by AWS. You see that in comparison to weeks one through three. It's been a good night for this offense and this offensive line. On the road. Green Bay took that timeout. Third down and nine. Less than four to go. Look out. Sacked 21-yard line. So, at least they're going to get the ball back. Ooh, and Jared a little slow and arising. Rashawn Gary's had a good push from the left side. and you can almost see, you've got to give Taylor Decker a lot of credit trying to work through, watch him trying to hold up, and he's been trying to hold up all night against a fierce pass rusher. He's playing hurt, really almost on one leg here trying to hold up, and Rashawn Gary's been able to get the best of him. Here's Wyatt, another defender out of Georgia. Seen so many of those great players, so many on the Philadelphia Eagles defense, but Wyatt was an unsung hero even though he was a first-rounder off that Georgia defense in their first national championship a couple years ago. Decker, of course, went to Ohio State. You've heard of them, right? I have, yeah. First round pick. See, their coach got fired up, Ryan Day, last week. You think? Whoa. Big win. As Keith Jackson would say, whoa, Nelly. 31-yard line here, Nixon. Nixon into Detroit territory, still on his feet. Great run back, man. That's been over the past couple of years to the 35 he goes. Upcoming schedules for these teams. Talked a little bit about it before. So for the Lions, you've got Carolina coming to Detroit, then at Tampa Bay at Baltimore, Vegas, and a bye. Green Bay will go to Vegas next week. Then they're off at Denver, Minnesota, and the Rams come in here week nine. On the left there, other than the trip to Baltimore, They're probably going to be favored in every game that they play.
