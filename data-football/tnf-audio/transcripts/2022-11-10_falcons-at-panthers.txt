 about the pieces that they have to work with this year. It feels like they're heading in a better direction. But he said it's really about trying to build a culture. Toughness, physicality, playing hard, running to the football. I think he likes what he sees. I think Rashawn Evans and Lorenzo Carter have a big part of doing it the right way. Second and eight. Through the middle this time. Hubbard, gain of three. Kaylee, what you got? Al, Rashawn Evans told me that when Dean Pease draws on his experiences to make a point, he doesn't always cite the most obvious Hall of Famers that he's coached. So instead of Ray Lewis and Ed Reed, Pease likes to point to players who've contributed to his team's successes, like Eric Weddle. Evans explained, Pease wants everyone to know that they're important, and the way you play and the things you do have an impact. Yeah, Eric Weddle's a good illustration of that type of player, because Eric came out of retirement last year. All that happens is he's got a Super Bowl ring. third down and four to the outside that'll be a first down DJ Moore makes the grab run out by Fenton at that spot spot the ball at the 37 first down good recognition by PJ Walker uses the motion recognizes the man to man and now you get him out on the edge where he's an easy throw with a corner Fenton off. He recognized that. They had everybody up near the line of scrimmage. He knew that he had his guy. He moves him, moves him back. Fenton couldn't stay with him. Gave him a couple steps in the motion. Put the ball out in front. Walker looks very different this week, obviously, the way he played against Cincinnati. On the ground. Black here. Short game. So, we're talking about the quarterbacks. Of course, they traded for Baker Mayfield after Cleveland had signed Watson. So Mayfield comes here. He's the starter. They also have Sam Darnold, who's been hurt. They also drafted a rookie as well. And P.J. Walker was going to be the fourth quarterback at the beginning of training camp. You just saw Darnold on the sideline right there. Second down and five. Through the middle. And working his way for a first down. Goes Foreman again. to the workhorse tonight. Foreman carrying nine times already for 45 yards. He doesn't need a lot of room because he's able to get a lot of yards after contact. But man, this offensive line doing a really good job opening things up for him. Boy, he's had a heck of a story himself of what he's been through. Had to persevere. Looked like he might be out of the league, but he kept kind of showing that perseverance that it takes to get opportunities. and finally had a big year last year with Tennessee when Derrick Henry went down. After Henry got hurt, he had a big second half of the season. And then he comes back and gets the job here. And with McCaffrey gone, he's the number one back. Lost a two there, second and 12. I think it's really one of the first times we've seen tonight we got a player down for the Falcons. We've seen penetration. That time it was Lorenzo Carter making the play. He's taking the knee right now. Taequann Graham. Take a look at him. Graham had that big fumble recovery last week, but then gave it back to the Chargers home. Graham walked off the field under his own power. Meanwhile, you've got the second and 12 in the 14th play of this drive coming. And they whistle that dead because the Falcons were coming across the line. It looked like everybody moved on the offensive line except the center didn't snap the ball. I don't know if they'll call that on Carolina. All right. Ball starts. Offense. Number 70. Five-yard penalty. Still second down. And that one on the Brady Christensen. Lift guard. Probably the first time early in this game we've seen P.J. Walker and the Panthers offense getting behind the sticks. Remember, they have struggled all year on third down. Worst in the league in third down conversions. But tonight, three of four because they've been very manageable. Now we'll see what they do here on second down and long. Second and 17. Through the middle this time for the 27-yard line. Chuba Hubbard second year back out of Oklahoma State. When he's healthy, I think people are really going to like what Hubbard brings to the table. He's a really good complement to what Forman can do with the power. He's got incredible acceleration. He's got good size. You know, he's 210 pounds. And he's been back and making quick decisions in the pass game. Tonight, there's been coverage. He's had to hold on to the ball. He's had to try to make something happen. and the fourth time now that he's thrown the ball into coverage. And a couple times we've seen that backfire on him with the big interception here by Horn. Horn, eighth overall pick last year. Remember his father, Joe Horn, the receiver, a lot of years with the Saints. Start this drive with a run up the middle for a gain of four by Deontay Foreman, who has now carried the ball 11 times for 48 yards in the half. That's his style. You know, he'd love to have it 25 to 30 times. Last time they played a couple weeks ago, he carried it 26 times, had 118 yards and three touchdowns. So he likes going up against his Atlanta defense, and he's only going to get better the more touches he gets. Panthers have outgained the Falcons by a ratio of 3 to 1. Close to a first down here. Foreman. Kaylee. Well, Al, when the Falcons released Deontay Foreman during the preseason last year, like Kirk said, he thought his career was over. He actually turned his focus to his trucking company, Foreman Transport, but he promised his dad that if he got another opportunity to play, he would make the best of it. His dad didn't live to see the comeback. Last October, Derek Foreman was killed driving a semi-truck, and a month later, the Titans called, and Deontay was ready. Great to see him back. starting his career with Houston, got hurt, bounced around, and now he's found a home. Meanwhile, you've got Hubbard in here, and he will pick up the first down on a third and one. So first down at the 32-yard line, under three to play in the half. Carolina's giving Atlanta some of their own methods. They are controlling the line of scrimmage. This offensive line, this continued, you're going to give a game ball. You're going to give a game ball to the collective unit in the way they're getting a push up front and winning the battle. You knew it was going to be that kind of game with the wind and the rain, who was going to win up front, really, on both sides of the ball. And they're giving Foreman and Hubbard room to work. Keep it on the ground. You know, it's funny. Last week, talking about the game in Cincinnati, the halftime score was the Panthers nothing and the Bengals 35. Yeah. Tonight, 10-0 Panthers. They have the ball. We're going to tick down to the two-minute warning right here. Yep. So the Panthers trying to stay alive in the NFC South at the two-minute warning in Charlotte. In Charlotte, two-minute warning, second down and six. As this drive continues here to the outside, trying to turn the corner but can't, is Foreman. It will be third down and six. The way this first half has gone for the Atlanta offense, I know we're in the first half, but this feels like a big drive for the Atlanta defense to try to hold Carolina to a field goal attempt. Timeout taken by Atlanta. They've got to conserve the clock here because they will not get the ball to start the second half. So Carolina looking for that two for one, and Atlanta trying to stop that in its tracks. Tonight 131 yards on the ground. They're averaging close to 6 yards per carry. So third and seven. Carolina with 161 total yards and Atlanta with 51. Going to draw, and that doesn't fool anybody. So, stuffed is hovered by Graham. Fourth down. Meanwhile, rushing, and we've seen that tonight. It's back, entering week 10. 241 yards per game. That's the highest since 1987. You know, 121 apiece for each team per game. Highest run percentage for Chicago with Justin Fields. 60% Atlanta, 58% is next. And those are the records with the teams that run the most. I think it's a combination of having more athletic quarterbacks, not just design run, but quarterbacks that take off and improvise and help their running games is number one. And the other thing, I think you talk to more and more offensive coordinators around this league, right now a lot of defense is playing with a too high shell. Cover two is the answer. Avoid the explosives. Give up the running game. And I think you're seeing more and more teams have to be able to run the football. Beniro now trying to find the right combination, D.J. Moore. So he buys the team for about $2.5 billion, which is going to be like chicken scratch by the time they finish showing Washington. And Denver, of course, went for $4.5. But they've had four head coaches and seven quarterbacks in four years. So the recipe for success is not this. No, and I think the biggest thing in this league is if you don't have it right under center, It's going to make it an uphill battle. And that's really where they've been since Cam Newton was healthy and they had it rolling. Since then, they've been trying to come up with answers, and they just haven't found it. And second and 11. Bursting over the right side goes Deontay Foreman for a first down. He gave a lot of breathing space. A really good job up front. Brady Christensen, watch him, 70. The left guard does a nice job of helping out here with Bozeman, the center. able to get right there, just kind of seal that. And there's the vision. You know, Deontay Foreman looks at himself and sees a small back. He's 235 pounds. He's learned to get behind his pads and run. He learned that in college at Texas. But I think he's very nimble. He catches the ball out of the backfield and shows you what he can do with his vision and bounce like that. To the left side, trying to break the tackle. Picking up a couple of extra yards that time. So, Chenault, tackled by Rashad Fenton, who came over at the trade deadline from Kansas City. Gain of six. They've got pieces on the outside. D.J. Moore is clearly their go-to guy, number two. You've got Terrace Marshall out of LSU. He's a guy that I think is getting better and better, especially in the recent weeks since Robbie Anderson's been moved out. And Chenault, you just saw. I mean, he's a big, strong, physical receiver. Could be a running back. He's so skilled. 6'1", 220, and knows what to do with the ball once he's able to catch it. Gave him eight yards on the play. Make it second down and two. Pass goes out to Chenault again. And he leans and tries to pick up the first. Comes very close. Richie Grant in on the tackle. The naked eye anyway, a little bit short. Third and inches. That's a big part of what they do with this offense. it's not a they'll take their shots Walker likes to push the ball downfield but a lot of his throws are out there on the edge and the perimeter especially against this Atlanta defense they're one of the worst tackling teams with some of the injuries that they have at corner make them have to tackle out on the perimeter won't have to run a play and they don't that takes us to the break into the first quarter 3-0 Panthers back from Charlotte after these messages Putter number two here. The standings in the south. The Bucs who are in Germany on Sunday to face Seattle and Munich. Bucs and Falcons four and five. Saints lose the other night to the Ravens. Panthers come in two and seven. So nobody in the division. Over 500 as we said at the top though. You win the division. You get to host a wild card game. Meanwhile, here's P.J. Walker on the third and inches. Picking up a first down on the first play of the second quarter. He's the defensive coordinator of the Falcons. There he is. And retired. Arthur Smith got the job. Talked him into coming back at the age of 73. 15 years with a couple of teams as a defensive coordinator. Been around the best. Worked with, obviously, Bill Belichick. Worked with, going back to some of his college days, Nick Saban. Been around a lot of great minds. To the outside. Deontay Foreman. Tackled by Walker. It'll be second and six. 73 years old. He tried to retire a couple times. Vrabel brought him in to Tennessee where he helped out that defense when Vrabel was just getting gone in Nashville. And then when Arthur Smith left Tennessee and went to Atlanta, he's ready to step away again and did. And then they brought him back. And talking to him this week, he just said, you know what? I'm enjoying building something, trying to change a culture. We haven't had a top-10 defense in 25 years. He said, we're working to get back to having that kind of defense. Channeling the great pick LeBeau. And through the middle of the left guard goes Deontay Foreman. So once they traded McCaffrey, Foreman became the stud in the backfield. No doubt about it. It helps when you have this kind of room to run between the center and the left guard. Really good job on that double team. Linebackers kind of get caught up. They ran in to the blocks, both Walker there and also Carter. They just kind of got eaten up by those linemen. And it opened up an easy hole there for Foreman. Foreman a load of 235 pounds. Gain of a couple right here. Right to midfield. It'll be second down. And eight. And Dean Pease has really challenged this team. He said he feels better. Panthers won the toss and have deferred. So can Atlanta get to 500? Can Carolina stay in the race? Nobody's going to run away with this division, at least the way it looks right now. And away we go from Charlotte. And Patterson will have an opportunity from the two-yard line. Pass to 20 and gets spilled at the 27. And we start with a flag. Adrian Hill is tonight's referee. And we'll hear from him post-haste. Marcus Mariota, what a story he is. He started his career with Tennessee, last two years in Vegas as the backup to Derek Carr. His pass rating in Week 8 against the Panthers was great. Threw for 253, three touchdowns. And he has taken every snap from center, and a good many of them, out of the shotgun or the pistol, as is the case here. Patterson is the running back from the 17-yard line. To the outside goes Cordero. He'll pick up three. He'll be second down and seven. Arthur Smith and this organization went out and decided to bring in Marcus Mariota. Of course, the experience that he had with him when he was there with the Titans, I think he felt that he would fit perfectly with what they wanted to do. Remember we talked in the open about trying to control the line of scrimmage, become more physical, and his ability to run. We'll talk more about this throughout tonight. His ability to run is a great complement along with the play-action pass. very much rejuvenating his career this season. Second down and seven. That was Zaccheaus in motion. Play action. He used a ton of this, too. And the pass is incomplete, trying to get it to the tight end pitch. And we've got another flag. Yeah, he had men downfield. Looked like Jake Matthews was downfield there. Who's already had a very busy day. He sure has. Getting that information after the call. Ineligible main downfield offense, number seven. That penalty is declined. His wife and his new son, his firstborn, then gets back with the owner and jogs in in his flip-flops just a little over an hour ago, and now he's on the field. Amazing. I heard now that he drove to Atlanta. Third down and seven. That pass is taken in at the 30-yard line by Kyle Pitts. So Pitts, first-round pick last year, tight end, hybrid. A wide receiver slash tight end like so many other tight ends in the league this year. Yeah, and it's such a tough matchup for Xavier Woods. 6'6", 245, and can get separation. Ball is thrown out in front where he gives him a chance. And there's the blind side behind Mariota. We just talked about Jake Matthews. Such a pro. Does a nice job there to give him the time he needed to make that throw. Running back this time is Caleb Huntley. They're four guys with 299 or more yards this season. And Huntley goes next to nowhere, losing one. Back to the 29-yard line, Shaq Thompson making the tackle. It'll be second down and 11. Steve Wilkes and Al Holcomb, who's the interim defensive coordinator, they're going to load up the line of scrimmage. You see right in the middle that one of the leaders in this defense, number seven, been here for a long time, Shaq Thompson. and great job of being able to get off of that block, potential block, by Drew Dahlman, his center, trying to climb up to the second level, but loading up on the early downs, anticipating the run from the Falcons. So Al Holcomb took over as the defensive coordinator in October after the purging of the staff, and Patterson stopped after a short game, setting up third and long. And it's a Carolina defense that, especially in recent weeks, has really struggled against the run, you know, especially into the interior. Teams have worked the edge going away from Brian Burns. They've gone towards the younger Gross Matos, the number 97, who's emerged to kind of become the edge defender of the opposite side of Brian Burns. And they've had a lot of success running. But here on this first drive, they're just putting too many bodies up there trying to negate that run game, make Mariota have to throw. Joe Mixon had a little bit of success on the ground against him last week. Wired and confused. This time they slow things down a bit. Loaded up heavy on the left. Second and goal. Patterson in the backfield. Play action. Over the middle. Caught. Drake, London, but a flag for the moment. A touchdown. And London thinks it will be on the defense. to begin to celebrate already. Get the call to make it official. Personal foul. Unnecessary roughness. Defense, number 25. The touchdown is good. That 15-yard penalty All right, that's on Xavier Woods. Well, you can see the attention. You've got three tight ends. You go here with Pitts. Watch how that impacts the safety and how they have to respect that. You've got two guys that go with Pitts. Opens it up for London. Good job of reading it by Mariota. And then putting it up high with a big, tall receiver. The rookie out of SC can go up and get it. Proud hates the pull. Poole comes in for the extra point. to make it a three-point game. And he can't! Wide to the right. So it remains 13-9, with six minutes and 15 seconds remaining in the third. Eighth overall pick in the draft. Finding Drake London, and not locking in, predetermining to get the ball here, To the big tight end. He's covered here by Horn. The safety also moves with him. Once that safety starts to move with Pitts, he comes off of him, and then he finds London. And the best part is the location and the accuracy of the throw. Meanwhile, Kuh had made 71 consecutive extra points, which we didn't mention beforehand, so we can't be blamed for a kibosh. No. But there it was. 71 in a row. Missed to the right. Short kick. Fielded there by Blackshear. And he gets corralled at the 16. Meanwhile, P.J. Walker in that crazy game week eight. The end of the game, at the end of regulation. Take a look at this. From the 35-yard line, he launches it. Launches it? Yeah. Two yards past the goal line, but it's officially a 65-yard from the line of scrimmage throw. he had about a 1 in 10 chance of completing it and he didn't of course that's when the helmet came off the extra point was missed it went to overtime and Atlanta won the game on first down it's fired and caught up at the 30 yard line and taking it to midfield and into Falcon all the way to the 38 yard line goes Paris Marshall 43 yards Atlanta defensively has a lot of guys up here action goes this way and boy he's in rhythm on this throw little play action able to get back and because the linebackers are uptight has a nice window to be able to throw into and puts it right on the money to Marshall who continues to get better and better until that point Walker had thrown for 38 yards all night That's good for 43. From the 38. Nice hole there. Good tough running there by Blackshear. Pre-agent rookie out of Virginia Tech. Iguanu, the rookie from North Carolina State, pulling around there and making his presence felt. A big block there on Walker, the linebacker. So right now, Ben McAdoo mixing up the play calling, potentially a heck of an answer by Carolina. Kwanu, again, the rookie, watch him. He just seems like most rookies had some games early in the year that gave him some issues, but he seems like he keeps adjusting every single week to the speed of the game. It's a really nice job there of opening that up and a good job of reading it by Blackshear. Kaylee? Kirk, growing up right here in Charlotte, Aquanu became something of a renaissance man. You're going to love this. At Providence Day High School, he won a state title in wrestling. Double team. This offense loves those duos, zone plays, where they like to use the double team. Watch how he handles this double team and just is able to split through it. Not only is he holding up those blocks from getting up to the linebacker, but once they start to climb, he's able to shed and make that play right at the line of scrimmage. play action, has time going to the end zone, almost intercepted, trying to go to Moore covered beautifully by Darren Hall, no chance, it'll be third down and ten. He'd love to have this one back, Sullivan breaks free at this second level, watch how this breaks free, he's just kind of locked in on his main target, here's the read right here, he locks in on Hall, trying to see that if he could get the ball thrown downfield and you can see the tight end breaks free. If he would have been able to come off of that, that's an easy first down and potentially a touchdown. Predetermined that time, just trying to get the ball forced into D.J. Moore. That's what cost him last week in Cincinnati. Third and ten from the 28-yard line. Pressure put on. Pass is incomplete. Not even looking for it. Miscommunication that time. Tommy trembled the tight end. and the blitz was put on that time. Rashawn Evans coming in. So it's fourth down to ten. In comes the field goal group. Not even looking that tight. No, no. Hit him off the left elbow. The blitz there by Evans. There's nothing Walker could do there, any more that he could do than just get the ball out. Obviously, Trembl's got to be anticipating that throw, especially with the linebacker blitz. 46-yard attempt that he pinheiroed. Looking for the first points of the game With seven minutes to go in the quarter And the kick is close Hits the post And bangs through Single doink For three points Three nothing Carolina And stats which are powered as you know by AWS That had to be the wackiest game of the year. That was the craziest game, in my mind, of this season, which is at about the halfway point right now, as for Darrell Patterson. He's going to run the kick back again. And the man who has returned eight kickoffs for touchdowns in his career gets to the 35-yard line. Marcus Mariota talking about the rejuvenation of his career. He was the next big thing, of course. He was drafted number two back in 15 when he goes to Tennessee. Arthur Smith is there on the offensive staff. And then he was often injured, went to Las Vegas. Credits John Gruden and Derek Carlott for helping him regain his love of football. He's falling out of love with the game. And now he's back, and as I said before, he's taken every snap this season. Running back is Tyler Algier, but he'll keep it himself, Mariota. and then he picks up about a yard and a half. I thought that was pretty powerful. You know, we spoke with him this week, and he opened up, talked about, you know, when I left Tennessee, I just lost that passion. I lost the love. I was beat up physically, mentally. He said John Gruden, Derek Carr, that quarterback room in Las Vegas, really got him back and got him healthy and got him to love the game again. This is Tyler Algier, rookie out of BYU. fifth round pick, Derrick Brown making the tackle behind the line of scrimmage. It'll be third down and nine. Boy, has Derrick Brown gone to another level, being able to be physical and then being able to chase and make plays like this. That's a running back that he's able to get up to and pull down from behind. I think this in his third year out of Auburn is the year you finally can see the potential of what 95 can do in the middle. Go no huddle again here. on a third and nine. Pressure coming. Hangs in the pocket. Fires caught at the 45 of the Panthers that time by Demir Bird. And then he'll move to six. On a third and nine, they pick up a first down on a gain of 18. Yeah, he's out here. He's going to get man to man. But what I want you to watch here on third down and long is the protection. You get a blitz. It's not common to see that. and he does a good job of not having to bail and use his athletic ability. He sits in the pocket, trusts his line, and they give him the time to make the throw. Rolling right, throwing, and is Bird able to stay inbounds? Panthers say no, and so do the officials, second and ten. I think you're going to see more and more of those first and ten throws because of the way Carolina they just putting everybody up there It an offense from Atlanta When you look at first and ten play calling 60 Carolina with Bradley Pena punt and then the defense does their job They should get outstanding field position here. Johnny Hecker, this will be his third punt. First one was 52, and then a 32-yarder as well. a long-time Ram in his 11th season now. And look out, down he goes in the end zone. It's fielded at the 45-yard line, and again the man averaging 20 yards per punt return takes the ball out of the 42-yard line. So meanwhile you've got Richie is in the end zone, and he's in distress. Helmet comes off. There was a lot of action right after the Hecker punt, as you'll see. As the Falcons take over at the Carolina 42, trailing by 10. Mariota hangs in the pocket, throws too high and incomplete. One of the rare times tonight he's gone to pits with a great rookie season. Overall fourth pick in the draft last year. And they caught him in a coverage where they're not on the same page. crossing route, and nobody's there. You see late movement there by the safety Hartsfield, but this is one that Marcus would love to have back. And this is a big target. His catch radius is probably his greatest strength at 6'6", but just misses an open target there. Love the aggressive call on first and ten and plus territory. Only one catch for a pitch tonight. He's been targeted four times. Mariota throwing, and that's behind pitch. So Flan comes in. You've got Dante Jackson right there as well. And the penalty is going to go against the Panthers. Yep. Into the route, Dante Jackson. Pass interference. Defense. Number 26. Ball will be placed at the following foul. On that first down. Just at the top of the route here, Jackson. Again, think about it. Six hits how big and powerful he is as a tight end, really as a receiver, when he flexes out and makes contact there, and Atlanta catches a break. From the 31 now. 852 left in the third. through the middle to the 25 goes Algier talking about pitch before most receiving yards by a rookie tight end, but that's pretty good company Mike Ditka back in 1961 and that was really impressive because in those years they were playing 12 games and not the 17 that they played last year yeah I think he just is they want to utilize him more and more keep in mind down here Mariota on that zone read to keep the ball when they get closer to that 20 yard line he becomes more and more of a factor in their attack second down four picking and threading and then shurning his way for a first down goes Tyler Algier taking it to the 19 yard line first down Atlanta And that was a heck of a job of cutting back and getting behind Drew Dallman, the center, who did not give up on the play himself. Some good job of just navigating. See penetration, so he's able to get underneath that. And there's 67, Dallman with a good block. Fighting for every inch tonight, this Atlanta offense. A lot of shifting. Two backs in there with Mariota out of the pistol. Hands the ball off this time. Caleb Huntley. First down and setting up a first and goal goes Huntley. Really good job of sealing this edge right here to give the back Huntley a chance to be able to get back underneath that. Initial surge there on the outside, and then the quickness to cut and accelerate underneath it. And going quickly here on first down. And no gain here for Huntley. It'll be second down and goal. Stopped by Shaq Thompson. Kind of keep talking about Arthur Smith and Marcus Mariota and why they like to change up their tempos, and they feel they have a defense on the ropes a bit. A lot of the offenses around, whether it's college or pro football, they like to go a little faster and try to become, like I say, the aggressor and get the defense top. Four touchdowns plus one receiving. Mariota, the fake, and then Algier makes the grab, but that didn't fool anybody. Number seven, Shaq Thompson is there for his second tackle on his fourth down. You play man-to-man, and it's just great vision here. He's locked in, not fooled at all. You've got man-to-man across the board. Thompson able to get to the back because of the anticipation before anybody up front would have a chance to climb up to him. If you get that block, of course, there's a lot of room to run, but the instincts and anticipation by Thompson, the difference. Bradley Pinion descended skyward. Guy Smith lets it go. And the line of scrimmage will be the 32 for Walker. And the Panthers when we come back. Call it uptown. Hard by the stadium. And away we go with the Panthers on offense. Deontay Foreman is the running back. As they start from the 31-yard line. P.J. Walker to Foreman. And he fights for about five. Take a look at P.J. who had the best game in his career. two weeks ago. 19 for 36. 317. Of course, that tremendous TD at the end. Sending it into overtime. And then last week, 3 out of 10. 9 yards. 2 picks. Rating against Cincinnati. 0.0. Gotta get him off to a good start. Get him some easy completions like he told us. 2nd and 6. He's going to now have a 3rd and short. As Foreman takes it to about the 40-yard line, and Evans makes the stop. I actually went to that game last week that he played in, and it was like watching a different team. And you know the NFL is week to week, but I was there watching the Bengals living in Cincinnati, and it was amazing to see them. They were down 14 to nothing in a blink of an eye. Then he started to press. He started to try to make things happen, and Joe Burrow and that Cincinnati offense just kept going. The game got away from him. You saw that now. But 27% is what they convert on third down. That is the worst in the league by a lot. Well below the league average. But this time they're going to get it as Foreman picks up the necessary yardage. First down. Yeah, this is an offense with the quarterback play that you have to avoid. You've got to stay on schedule. Every offense wants to stay on schedule. But Ben McAdoo is a play caller. I mean, they get to third and seven plus. You saw the graphic 12%. So, yeah, you've got to get positive yards. Keep it on the ground again this time. Nowhere. Brendan Jay making the tackle right there. Put it about a yard behind the line of scrimmage. It'll be second down and 11 from the 40. Great play by Grady Garrett. We're going to be saying that a lot tonight. He's just on the left shoulder, just the edge there of the center Bozeman. And look how he locks him up and then uses, we talked to him, do you use quickness or strength or both? He said strength early to set him up with my quickness. I think he used both on that play. First time we see Chuba covered in the game. Passes caught along the air sideline by D.J. Moore, who's been over 1,000 yards receiving in each of the last three seasons. Again, at 20 yards, first down. Keep in mind, A.J. Terrell still out. Casey Hayward out. So you get a one-on-one matchup with your top receiver. And you can see he flips Darren Hall around, gets the separation, and good for P.J. Walker. After the week that he had last week in Cincinnati, great way to start going to his main target who gets that separation for an easy throw. Going against the worst pass defense in the league. this time they give it to Larkshire a rookie and a Virginia Tech free agent and he picks up a first down on his first carry of the night for a dozen yards good job of showing how physical he can be we know about Foreman and Hubbard but you get the third third back in you're going to pull the back side both the right guard and the right tackle keep an eye on Austin Corbett 63 does a nice job of getting around and sealing that the big fella Lamotin also giving him a little bit of room, but even at contact, keeps those legs driving and picks up the first down. Three first downs on this drive. Ball at the 28th on the Panthers' first possession of the night. Blackshear again. Scored a touchdown in the second half at Cincinnati last week after the game was well out of hand. Timothy Horn making the stop there. It'll be second down and ten. That is how you handle a dump right there by the big man. and they get that first down. What did the analytics say? The analytics say you're out of your mind if you go for it. Pinion. Short kick. It was tipped, I think. We'll check it out, but they're going to have good field position with five and a half to go in the half. Father Fred Smith had founding FedEx after that spectacular career in the military. So Arthur and the whole Smith family very much into Veterans Day, which is tomorrow and Veterans Week as they start this drive after a 29-yard punt. Richie making the catch. Meanwhile, before the game, you see Joe Gibbs racing. That's before the game, Arthur Smith wearing that hat. Joe Gibbs, when he was at Washington, gave Arthur his start in coaching. in the National Football League. And, of course, Coy, Joe's son, passed away this week. Suddenly, the whole NASCAR community is in warning and is a tribute to him for that happy for the game. Second and eight from the 42. Can they cash in on that bad punt and good field position? Swinging out here to Chennault. Chennault down the sideline. And he goes, staying inbounds, and Chennault all the way with a touchdown. Levisca, Chennault. Came over in a trade with Jacksonville earlier this season. And then he goes. The blitz here, the timing of this play call with Chennault going in motion couldn't be any better. Now you get it out. Now you've got two blockers with the receivers against two defensive backs. So without that blitz, you have three defenders out there. You're able to defend it. But you blitz, you got two wide receivers, great effort there, an initial point of contact there, and then the speed. We told you how dangerous he can be if you get him out in the open field. They're calling it a run as he made the grab behind the line of scrimmage. 41-yard rush Pinheiro for the extra point. And with four and a half to go in the first half. Standing bounds all the way. 10-0. Panthers. A lot to chew over. No doubt. No doubt. Let's go back to this touchdown by Chennault. We mentioned the blitz comes from the field right here. And you get the two-on-two. Good blocking by Marshall and Moore. But watch in the middle of the field, the free safety. Hawkins gets tied up with Rashawn Evans. They run right into each other right there. It really looked like Evans was closing ground. But those two right there at about the 25-yard line, kind of a microcosm of how this night has gone so far for Atlanta. From the 25. And the Falcons mount a drive here before the half. Mariota chased. Keeps his eyes downfield and then throws into traffic. Battered incomplete. lead. Trying to get it to Zaccheaus. Covered by Dante Jackson. Second down and 10. I think first of all Gras Matos does a good job of containing. Gets to the outside then chases. Big. Has great length and speed. Loses footing but he did enough there but this is just a careless decision. Third time we've seen Mariota trying to make a play. Trying to make something happen. Trying to get the ball back to Zaccheaus but taking a big risk and almost throws an interception. Mariotta now 4 of 8 for 36 yards. Atlanta's gained only 51 yards in the half. Pressured again. Look out. Flag throw. Launches one deep down field and that's picked off at the 37 yard line. J.C. Horn and he steps out of bounds near midfield. And Adrian Hill is the next man who will tell us what is going on. And if you're going to have a hold with the Falcons again, there's another play where Mariota is trying to make a play happen, and he saw Pitts break free. Here is Milka, the play for offensive holding, first down. So there's no foul, as it turns out. Horn gets the pick, and the Panthers up by 10, in good shape again, with 4.11 to go in the half. And what Mariota's been doing when he's been effective this year has been decisive. A lot of people have been comparing it to why they're running out of pistol, they're running tempo, he's playing carefree. It looks like he did it when he was in Oregon winning a shot. I do, too. You've got Pitts at 6.6. You've got London at 6.4. He's got the background with hoops where he can go up and try to just, you know, take a 50-50 shot and then kick the field goal. I'm with you. Koo one of the best in the league. Long this year, 54. This is a chip shot here. Of 33 yards. They try to get them on the board before they go to the locker room. Pinion puts it down. Koo bangs it through. and we are at halftime in Carolina in Charlotte 13-3 Panthers on top Mercedes-Benz halftime show coming right up Saints are 3-6 Carolina comes in 2-7 and off we go with the Panthers to get the ball to start the second half it's a bouncing ball that bounces all the way into the end zone moments ago, Kaylee was with Steve Wilks. Well, Coach, you have been able to hold Atlanta's strong running game to just 33 yards. What's been the key? That was the key coming into the game. We talked about controlling the line of scrimmage. I'm very pleased thus far. You know, I think we have 128. They have 33. That's going to be the difference in the game as we continue to progress through. Another key you were looking to in this game is your quarterback getting some early completions. What's impressed you most about how you're offering? Just really trying to manage the game and not trying to impress it, you know. So we can continue to do that, protect the ball, don't turn it away, don't turn it over. We're able to get one takeaway and hopefully we can get some more in the second half. Thanks, Coach. Appreciate it. Thank you. A speaker of the truth. No quarterback wants to hear as a team manager, but that's perfectly put by Steve Wilkes. Start from the 25-yard line. Rolling, throwing, caught. But the ball is out at the 48-yard line. and it is a loose ball and coming back the other way and out of bounds goes Evans. A flag at the end. It was Terrace Marshall who could not hold on. He gave it up and they turned it over. We'll take another look at whether it is a catch, whether there's anything to review, and here it is. Richie Grant ends up hitting him. Looks like he has a hold of that ball and then it's punched out, Right, juggling, but gets possession. And then it's him. Or does he? Terry, what are you seeing? He's bobbling, and he doesn't get control right away. We'll let Adrian talk. After two discussions, we've determined that it is an incomplete pass. After the play, personal foul, unnecessary roughness against the passing team, number 12. That penalty will be enforced in the previous spot. With Lawson down, it will be second down. All right, so the penalty is on Shai Smith. Pass is ruled incomplete. Shai Smith loses his cool, throws Rashawn Evans after he's out of bounds. That's where the 15 yards comes in. Just so much back and forth there. At first, you're like, oh, hey, positive first and ten play call, play action. Marshall makes a great play. Fumble. Atlanta has it. No, they don't. Incompletion in the 15 yards. A lot there for the first play of the second half. So, it's a half the distance, probably. So, it's second down and 22 now. Wait with that. Pick up some yardage on the ground here again. Foreman. A good first half. That's 15 carries now for 61 yards, averaging four per tote. And they've been throwing this look in a lot in the first half, and we'll continue to see it. Cam Irving, the backup tackle, will come in as an extra tight end. It just gives them another big body to move people around. You just heard Steve Wilks talk about we challenged our guys short week. Let's win the line of scrimmage. That's their game. Let's beat them at their game. First time tonight they've gone totally empty, and that's dropped. That's Chennault. The only touchdown in the game scored by him. And just like that, in 40 seconds, it's fourth and 16. Yeah, that's what Atlanta wanted to do. I mean, that's what Arthur Smith talked about, getting the ball back. Let's get a three and out going. And wouldn't be surprised to see Mariota back into that tempo approach where he's the aggressor. Atlanta trying to attack Carolina as opposed to being a little bit slower where it wasn't working out at all for Mariota in this offense. Hecker to punt. Avery Williams. Well behind the sticks. I'm with you. I thought that holding call occurred around the 26, 27-yard line. Right. And this thing, now they're actually moving it. So, let's see if they have a chance here on third down and nine. Right. They have to get to the 27. just outside the 27 as you can see with the other line 39 Mariota flushed out look out out of bounds so fourth and long no field goal in these conditions is going to be that easy and in comes Brad watch well Bradley Pinney is going to come in the punt How about the strength of Derek Brown? And then chases Mariota, who again is just deliberate with his, actually taking his time here to try to make that decision and doesn't find anybody downfield, throw it away or take off and go. Loss of five. Pinion with his fourth punt of the night. Bearcats call for, but it bounces. and the perfectly named Bradley Pinion just pinned Carolina at their own two-yard line. Early third. Carolina up front, this offensive line. Boy, in the first half, they were opening things up. Nice job of just keeping Atlanta off balance, running hard, and then getting the ball out on the perimeter to Chenault. Great blocking again by Moore and Marshall. And there's the speed at 220 pounds. As he gets down, gets a little help from Atlanta. Two defenders running into each other and takes it in for our only touchdown of the night. So from the two after that punt, Carolina begins this drive. Foreman is the running back, and you've got action along the left side. So that will move it back to the one-yard line. Ball start. Off it. Number 79. Half the distance to the goal. Well, our producer Fred Goodelley said we should get into this guy, right? So you talk about a kibosh. During a commercial break, kibosh, we just gave it to him. First offensive player picked in the draft, sixth overall. At a North Carolina State. Looking for some room here. Well, why not? More yellow. I think he, not only did Freddie get him a, now he got him a holding call. Potentially. Oh, baby. If it's in the end zone. He got him a false start. Now he's got him a holding call. No, I don't think it's in the end zone. They better hope it's not. It's close. Again, hit potential penetration here by Graham. Just jump in that gap. Boy, it's really close. Who's he calling him on here? To start with. I think it's 79's got to be. Meanwhile, you've got 82 there. Tommy Tremble as well. He's engaged. The conversation here is explaining it to Arthur Smith and see what he wants to do after the call. Holding offense, number 79. That penalty is declined. Second down. All right, he takes the down. Smart. Yeah, a little half a yard. Yeah, you're asking for, you know, 12 inches. Let's see what. Or less. Cam Irving's checking back in. Again, going to that power look. Off to the right side. It's Marshall setting up on the left side. Again, trying to get some room. And at least a little bit for Foreman. Stopped by Graham, and we check in with Kaylee. Well, Alan Kirk, Cam Irving, he's on the field now, and he's got a new nickname. Around the Panthers facility, they call him the Icky Whisperer. Because the former first-round pick has become Akeem Ickwannu's mentor and literally whispers in his ear in the meeting room to sharpen his technique. Ickwannu says Irving is trying to give him the advice he wishes he'd had as a rookie. Above all, he told me he's helping Ickwannu stay consistent and patient. The Icky Whisperer. Having nothing to do with Icky Woods. Third and nine. and at least the punt group will have a little bit of room to work with. This foreman gets the ball out to the eight-yard line. It'll be fourth down and six. Well, that last possession offensively for Atlanta didn't work out, obviously, but at least they're able to pen 9% of the time they run the football. That's second in the NFL. So that's the tendency, and they know they're going to have to break that tonight. Only Chicago runs more, and, of course, they better run a quarterback, who accounts for a lot of that percentage. Keeps it on the RPO and passes court here by Cordero Hodge for a first down with five minutes to go in the period. And that's how you answer people. They're going to load up the line of scrimmage is you get a feel for the safety woods, put a little play action, he bites up. Now you've got a nice seam behind him because he's getting aggressive towards the run to come up and make a tackle on Huntley, and an easy throw there again on the RPO. To the outside, again going nowhere, is Algier. Mariota this season loves to line up in the pistol. So play action passing 45% of the time. And you can see there a 96-7 rating is above the league average. And that's the answer to a team that is so run heavy. And defenses want to try to get them in a third and long. You've got to either RPO to make them respect the linebackers and safeties respected. Or the play action game. Patterson is the running back. Toss to him. Then runs out of room along the sideline there. Frankie Louvoo in on the stop. It'll be third down and nine for the Atlanta Falcons. Kyle Pitts trying to make a block on Louvoo, but unable to do that. Louvoo does a good job, but watching the inside again, chasing it from the inside out is the big fella, 95, Brown. You love to see a guy that is as big as he is at 320 pounds play with effort. And Chase plays down like that. Three receivers stacked to the right. Mariota escapes the tackle. A flag is thrown in the offensive backfield. And then his pitch making the grab there. And we'll get the call here from Adrian Hill. Colby Gossett, the third left guard they've had to use at time, gets caught off guard. Holding offense, number 66, 10-yard penalty, replay, third down. Ioannidis lined up to his outside shoulder and then shoots to the inside. He was expecting him over his left shoulder. You see him moving that way, and then he ended up slanting across his eyes, and I think it shocked him there on that third down. He just grabbed onto it. Just out of position. Back to the 43, third and 19. Has to pick it up off the ground. Another flag is thrown behind the flag. Deep downfield into a lot of good coverage and knocked down again by Xavier Woods. Fleck thrown at the inception of the play back at the 47 yeah it's the left guard again Gossett again look how they move a defender right next to him to create the one-on-one to give Ayondidas a chance to get that one-on-one matchup and he gets the hold again again with the injuries to Wilkinson Hennessy down to their third guy they're going to have an interesting challenge in the inside tonight almost an interception there by Woods Could have had two so far tonight, that secondary. There is just one foul on the play. Holding offense, number 66. That penalty is declined. There is no foul on the play for a legal forward pass. Fourth down. He's their third left guard in three weeks. So, in comes the punt group. That's not a daily double you want. Back-to-back penalties. No. No. That's going to be something that Carolina will try to expose all game long. This is the opinion's second kick. Shai Smith sets up inside his 10-yard line. Drifts over. Calls for the fair catch. Makes it at the 9. 2 to go In Charlotte the NASCAR Hall of Fame on this Thursday night Mentioned before 20 yards per punt return which is about 10 more than the league average And will they have a chance to return it? He will not because it goes out of bounds near the going on the ground here. Start with Patterson as the back. Again, a low snap. Patterson gets it. Breaks a tackle and then gets tripped up after a gain of a couple. Patterson's had a very interesting career. He started out, he was hot. Of course, he had those eight runbacks. Well, it wasn't the reason they changed the rule. They changed the rule for safety. But they took away those kickoffs. Yeah. And, you know, it cost him an opportunity to probably hold the record. He's tied for the most with eight. He just builds up in his size. He builds up such acceleration on those returns. Almost got out earlier today. He's big at 6'2 and 220. Rain and harder now. Mariota avoids the sack. He'll take off. Flag is thrown, though. And Marcus with a good run and then taken out of bounds there. But got away from Gross makes Meadows initially, but a flag thrown back at the 38-yard line, which is close to the line of scrimmage. Threw it right at J.C. Horn who held up with Kyle Pitts. Holding defense. Number eight. That five-yard penalty will be added to the result of the play. On that first down. And that is Horn. Yeah, just downfield. Again, it takes all you have. He is a matchup problem. him. They put Horn on him who can match up with him because of the speed and the physicality, but that good inside move forces Horn to react and just grabs around his waist. And now you get Atlanta. Remember, Mariota told us when we get first downs is where we like to get things going. Try to get a little bit of tempo, get defense on their heels. Patterson blocks the room. Should have the first down. behind a block by Caleb McGarry, who was their first-round pick out of Washington back in 19. Yeah, McGarry does a nice job, and Chris Lindstrom. You get behind that right side of this offensive line from Atlanta. There's so much potential. You see the rain coming down, and you get the big man going downhill, Patterson. Man, he is a handful. Three first-round draft choices on that Atlanta offensive line. It's second and one. They spot him just a yard shy. From the 28. Algier is the back. He gets it. Breaks the tackle. Picks up the first down. And a few more. Another flag. Flag down to the 26-yard line. That'll tell you who it's against. Yeah. Yeah, right in that holding area. Holding, Austin, number 46, 10-yard penalty replay, second down. Parker has C, back up tight end. He's trying to set the edge. He did everything he could to try to stop Littleton, including grabbing onto his arm and hand there. So it was second and one, and now it's going to be second and 11. Trying to find the right spot to place the ball here. It was second and one. so they have to get to the it should be the 38 yard line is where that ball should be spotted right now and Arthur Smith I think is saying that same thing so it should be three yards closer in so now it's second and 14 when it should be second and 11 and that pass is caught at the 35 yard line by the rookie Drake London and more laundry. Brian Burns may have created that holding call because of how sudden he got into the backfield. See a frustrated head coach based on what you were talking about, Al. There's no foul to play for illegal use of the hands. Okay. But still. Heard the 4x100 relay through shot put, was an AP student and he sang in the choir. His teammates are familiar with his athleticism, but they did not know he could sing until he surprised them at the Rookie Talent Show with a Boyz II Men song. I'm sure he's a great gourmet cook as well. Flag here. Meanwhile, just prior to that play, the officials stopped the clock for a second and took D.J. Moore off the field to be evaluated. Holding offense, number 70. Ten-yard penalty. Replay, second out. That's on Christensen, and it was second and two. And now it's going to be back to second and 12. So to the 40-yard line now. That is eight penalties for 74 yards on the Panthers. Second and 12. To the right side. Open. Caught. Smith. Shai Smith makes the grab. That's the first down of the 24-yard line. And they motioned Chennault, and it grabs the attention of the underneath coverage off to the right. You'll see Chennault move off here from the left to the right. Look at the defense up front. They have to pay attention, respect his potential. It gave him an ability to get the ball up and over top of Isaiah Oliver, and you could see him jump up in the air out of frustration, knowing that he should have sank in coverage there. Meanwhile, Moore still being evaluated on the sideline on first down here. Walker's going to keep it. Spin his way to the 16-yard line. Spin around Malone. Yeah, he actually misread Malone. Malone was his read key. He should have handed that ball off with Malone taking him, but his athletic ability gets away with one. That's a handoff when 51 takes the quarterback. But he does a nice job of making his read key there miss so he gets some positive yards. Foreman back in on a second and a long two. Deontay with it. And that will net the first down at the 13. You want to clean one thing up. I mentioned pitch before, the rookie record. And Mike Ditka said a 12-game season in 61. It was the first of the 14-game season. Okay. Still impressive. Still really impressive. Not as impressive as originally stated, but, you know, very. Yeah. Well, what a drive here. You know, again, P.J. Walker, it's his fifth start. Two games have been outstanding. Two games have been not so great tonight. Back into that rhythm and what the coaches love about his potential. Not so great is a great euphemism for a 0.0 pass. Yeah. I get the point. To the outside with room. and into the end zone. Touchdown. Broke away from Evans. So Deontay Foreman. In he goes. 12 yards. 83 on the night. And back to a two-possession lead. Lorenzo Carter on the edge goes into the inside with the tight end block tremble. So they lose the edge right away. And now you've got a poller coming around. And again, you allow Deontay Foreman to run downhill at 235 pounds. Makes it tough for even a linebacker like Rashawn Evans to try to bring him down with an arm tackle. Low snap, gets it down, but the kick is no good. It was all about the snap and the hole. Pinheiro misses. Each team missing an extra point. 1.51 to go, third, 19-9 Carolina. Can't wait. Your first vision. Yeah, great, man. Obviously, I've watched you call so many games there. Historic. Yeah, there have been a few. He did what? Right. That was my favorite. How many games do you think he's called there? Lambeau? Yeah. 30, maybe? Yep. That's good effort out of you. Thank you. Appreciate that very much. Good. Badge, badge about it. Meanwhile, this most shocking news all week. Indianapolis naming the interim head coach Jeff Saturday. Second head coach hired without any coaching experience in the NFL CFL. It comes. Norm Van Brocklin thought he was going to get the Philadelphia job when he retired. They passed him over, and he went to the Vikings instead. Marv Levy and Ron Meyer were hired in midseason from outside. A 49-yard attempt made a 46-yarder with a doink for the first points of the game. And this time inside the right upright and through. 13-0, and we are back in 30 seconds. We are back, and it's raining as hard as it has at any point today. These are the remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole. Downgraded from a hurricane, but making its presence very much felt here in western North Carolina. 13-0. And the kick will sail through the end zone. We'll see if this Atlanta offense can get going here with a minute 47 to go. It's been a struggle against Derrick Brown and his Carolina defense. Man, the big guy has been an enforcer. We knew coming in it would be a tough matchup for Atlanta's offensive line, the center and the left guard especially. But you could see him using his hands. The development and the growth of Derrick Brown has been extraordinary. A lot of people looked at him as a potential bust after his first couple years, picked very early in the draft, and thought he could be an Aaron Donald, Jonathan Allen type. And I think now he realizes he's more of a nose guard than he is a three technique. Keeps some good company meanwhile the pass is caught up at the 39 yard line And that's Drake London who takes a shot at three flags come in as he was popped by Xavier Woods So London their top draft pick at a USC Makes the grab the 13. Here's Adrian Hill Terry McCauley, come on in here, Terry. What do you see? It is out. He's still defenseless. He hasn't had time to clearly become a runner. Shouldered ahead. Clearly a foul. Hit on defenseless receiver. Okay. The thing that didn't get seen there is how quickly Mariotti got the ball out of his hands. That's his game. From the 46 through the middle. Splitting a little bit of an opening. And there is Avery Williams picking up about six on the play. Second down and four. So they've got three backs that they can use. Here's the fourth one in Williams. Good quickness can catch the ball out of the backfield there. And Clipper, Clipper, Clipper. Falcons have one timeout. Low snap. Collects it. High pass. That's collected. And forward progress will net the first down. He stays in bounds. That's Zaccheaus. Meanwhile, the best quarterback-receiver combo in the league in terms of pass rating are those two guys. And finally, Zaccheaus gets into the action. That's his first catch. Bad snap there. Mario handles it. When he's in tempo and he doesn't think, he just plays. That's when he's at again, when he plays his best. Big hole there. And Avery Williams to the 21-yard line. And that's a bust there by Carolina. They lost gap there. Brian Burns blitzed, but he blitzes inside. Nobody there. The blitz just opened up. Ball to 22, conserving that last timeout. Under a half minute now. Quickly to the outside to London, and he's going to stay in bounds. And he's tackled there by Jackson. So with 20 seconds, Atlanta has to take its last timeout. This is that run off to the left side. Watch them kind of blitz to the inside. They just lost him. Keep in mind, of all the backs, Avery Williams listed at 5'9". So you get behind those big offensive linemen. It's tough maybe for them to see him. But when they go back and look at that, not everybody on the same page. And Williams takes advantage of that getting up field. They've got a shot here. 21 seconds left. Best drive they've had. And, again, they get into that hurry-up mode with under two minutes to go. And going back to his Oregon days, that's, again, that's the comfort zone of Mariota. No timeouts. Five plays on this drive, 58 yards. Patterson is back in there. Mariota out of the pistol. Now flanked by Patterson. and throws to Patterson low, but he's able to collect it. Lugu making the stop there, but no timeouts. He got 12 seconds. At this point, they're just playing for the field goal. Right. And that's exactly what they're going to do right now. Just spike it there. I don't know. I thought you might can catch the ball, but hits that hole at a very different gear than Foreman. Graham back in for Atlanta along that defensive front. Nine minutes to go in the first half. Panthers on top. 3-0. 3rd and 12 here. Carolina's going to have to get a timeout. They do. Take it here, and we are back in 30 seconds. First time this season that Carolina has had as many as 15 plays. On a drive. This number 15 coming here. 14 plays, but they picked up only 63 yards. So, in bits and pieces are they moving downfield. Need a little chunk play here, and instead they're going to get a sack back at the 35-yard line. The ball came out after the whistle had sounded. Dee Alford came in. fourth down they tried a pump and go and you get some pressure coming off of here and really just nothing open downfield at all nobody really been on it sit back with the safety back there to take care of anything downfield see the little pump but everything taken and walker just gives up on the play a rare blitz there from dean peens he's known for that but not with this group this year one of the least i think they're 30th in the league as far as blitzes this year So you'd be looking at a 52-yard field goal, but the delay of game here, they're going to punt. Considering the conditions, you can understand that. It's going to rain a little harder. Delay of game. Offense, that penalty is declined. They're trying to give him a little bit more room, and Atlanta says no way. Yeah, that's one of those where you'd love to see P.J. Walker. They took a chance with that pump and go to throw it downfield. But if he throws that away, or they just throw an incompletion instead of taking a sack, you're looking at a 45-yard field goal, and now the sack takes him out of field goal range. Johnny Hecker, who's had a heck of a career with the Rams, came over here in the offseason. Avery Williams leads the league in punt return average 24. Won't have a chance here. And Carolina's going to down it at about the two-yard line. Perfect. Corey Littleton stops it right there. Halfway through the second quarter. 3-0 Carolina. Mayfield and Darnold. Meanwhile, Atlanta is backed up. They start from the three on this drive. Algier is the running back. So you've got Mayfield. You've got Darnold in the quarterback room. You've got Corrali. third-round draft choice who's been hurt. But you're wondering, next year, who will be the head coach? I mean, Wilts is the interim head coach. Yeah. They'll interview him, obviously. And the quarterback is going to be in college right now. Yeah, yeah. And you have Bryce Young out there from Alabama, C.J. Stroud at Ohio State, Will Levison, Kentucky. But I think the bigger issue is the NFL as a whole, trying to figure out which college quarterback is going to transition into this world and be successful. That's not just an issue for Carolina. I think that's an issue for everybody and a challenge. Over the right side, gain of four out to the nine-yard line goes Algier. You know, I think that the NFL, think about what's going on in Baltimore, what's going on in Philly. Think about these different offenses that we watch every single week. Atlanta now with Marcus Mariota. Chicago, what they're adjusting to. Luke Getzey is their play caller with Justin Fields. I think the offensive coordinators that are willing to forget how they grew up in the game in the NFL and are willing to look at the new skill set of these new players are the schemes and the offenses that are starting to really flourish. Third down and four. Through the middle and fighting. See where they spot it right now. Derek Brown makes the tackle on Algier. So it's either going to be fourth in a couple of inches or a first down. And from where they have just spotted it right now, it's going to be fourth down. Just for the effort alone in these last couple carries, I thought Algier might get the benefit of the doubt. Look who's got a hold of him there. The big man, Derek Brown, holding on. Drew Dowman trying to push, do everything they can just to get the yards. Watch 95. Remember, he's 320 pounds. plays with such power, gets rid of Dallman, and without that effort. The organization since 1986, but this was a stunner. From the 25-yard line now, Atlanta begins this drive, down by 10. Mariota avoids the sack, throws, caught, 44-yard line, spinning away. Big gain, still on his feet, and tackle finally is Zaccheaus as they go his way to the 47-yard line. Gain to 28. Still an unorthodox move. Who knows? I mean, he's never coached. You have no idea. I think he's coached high school. Right. And he was living in Atlanta, but he was still consulting with the organization. Loved, of course, by Jim Irsay. This is Algier going next to nowhere. They have two former head coaches on that staff. I mean, it's going to be crazy to go to Las Vegas this week where they meet Josh McDaniels, who left them at the altar a couple of years ago. Hey, if nothing else, it becomes an interesting story that everybody's going to be tuned in to. Just think about where they were at the beginning of the year. You and I had them. Our crew had them on a Thursday night with Denver, and things were starting to kind of unravel there. And to this point, where they are now, where Jeff Saturday is brought in as a coach. And speaking of the football, they had Matt Ryan, who was, of course, with Atlanta for the last 14 years. Second down to nine. Mariota, look out, and this time he goes down. He actually got the ball over to Algier, but he went down. He was able to get it away, but everybody was covered, and that's going to be the final play of the quarter. So, end of three in Charlotte. It's 19-9. Carolina and will return with the fourth right after these messages Hardline starting the fourth 19-9 Carolina Rain has pretty much stopped Mariota throwing deep downfield and throwing it out of bounds good coverage that time pitch was down there he had a blitz put on by Hartsfield fourth and 15 Sometimes a third down, you walk guys up like this in a mug look, and you drop them. This time, they dial it up. And by bringing that pressure, eventually Hartsfield gets into him. It affects the timing. You saw Mariota threw it, and Pitts didn't even realize the ball was in the air. Pinin with his fifth punt of the night. short very short and out of bounds at about the 23 yard line so for pinion a 29 yard punt so the last time they met week and a half ago 34 combined points scored in the fourth quarter most in any quarter in any quarter in the NFL this season. So, get 34 in the fourth plus the three in overtime. We'll take that. We'll take half that. You want DJ Moore. We talked about him going out to be evaluated. He is back in. There he is. Number two slot left. On the ground. Big run again, but of course he's got a flag with the 50-yard line. goes Foreman. So for the moment, that would be a 26-yard game. But there's always a however. Holding defense. Ooh. That is a crowd-pleasing however. It's on Abdullah Anderson. Abdullah Anderson, and just in the middle against the center trying to see it. You know, love to hear what Terry has to say about that. He's head up over the center, see Christensen come down, there is a left hand, but I mean, they've been doing that almost every play. He's grabbed by a collar, Kirk. It keeps him from getting to the second level. That's always a defensive holding foul. Foreman again. Dean with three. So Foreman 109 yards on 22 carries. He's averaging 5 yards per carry. Another big night for him. See Walker get penetration there? I mean, it gives you an idea of the lateral quickness for a big man. I mean, he was there. It was a 2-yard loss. And he's able to just kind of use that jump cut to work around him. And then again, the acceleration to get some positive yards. That should be a 2nd and 12. Instead, it's a 2nd down and 7. Swing it. possess the ball, they want to win the field position, turnover margin, all the little things that add up to victories. And when they get behind, it's kind of a kryptonite or a virus to their system. Yeah, they need a first down and a third down play. They're two out of nine. And Mariota is going to get it with his legs before he gets stripped up at the 24-yard line by Luvu. Four and a half to go. And this is a big part of where this offense is evolving. You know, it's not just the offensive line and Patterson and Dante Jackson who's down. He's had an ankle coming into this game trying to play through it. But it's his ability to run, his ability to create the zone read game. Just a big piece of what this offense is. And we haven't seen a lot of that tonight. Carolina defense has to get a lot of credit tonight, too. Especially after that disaster in Cincinnati. Yeah, he got 35-0 at halftime. And that's Al Holcomb. We mentioned they made the change when Matt Rule came in. Holcomb came in as what would be now the interim defensive coordinator. So this is a team, as we said before, looking at maybe a new head coach next year. We don't know yet. Obviously, they'll have to interview. And then maybe a new quarterback. Yeah, and I think you start with the defense right now. You've got Derek Brown. You've got Brian Burns. get some young stars on this defense. You throw in J.C. Horn, who's had a great night. I would throw in another guy, Jeremy Chen, who's not playing tonight. They've really missed him with a hamstring. They've got pieces, and what's great is they're at each level. Keith Taylor, 28, comes in. Meanwhile, getting the pass away just barely. It's Tyler Algier making the catch just before the sack. loss of 6 though, 2nd and 16 and until they find the right quarterback they're still, they've got to get that right even though they've got some pieces that would make them a serious contender Mariota, under pressure throws, pulled in along the near sideline by Demir Bird Rolling left, throwing right against the green. And a first down on a gain of 21. Yeah, they move the launch point. Get away from all that pressure because they're getting in there. We've seen a lot of pressure from Haynes. But what a throw, as you mentioned. Move the pocket to the left. Come all the way back. Had a little backyard football play there by Mariota. Front with danger, but it works. To the sideline again. That is caught. Making the grab again is Bird. And he will step out of bounds. Stopping the clock with 334. And that's a first down. Yeah, Bird is a guy that's known. He's an undersized guy. You want to get him the ball in space. Can do a lot of damage after the catch because of his quickness. Falcons on the move. Ball at the 43. This drive started back at their own three-yard line. Seventh play of the drive. Fired over the middle. High, but pulled in. Pitts is there, making the grab. Good catch to the 25. He goes. Watch this catch. Watch this, again, the radius at 6'6". That's what he's known for. It's only his second opportunity tonight, but they find the seam over the linebacker in front of the safety, and he got it out early to give Pitts a chance to get his head turned and then protect himself even though he's juggling the ball. Drive only two minutes old. They've already gone 72 yards in seven plays. Wide open and making the grab in the end zone. Pederal Hodge makes the catch for the touchdown. Wow. 97 yards, eight plays. That's good from 25, and they made it look easy. They sure did. And that's the best drive, not just for this offense, that Marcus Mariota, the throwback that you mentioned, where he rolled left with that pocket, came back and hit Bird, seemed to really accelerate the drive and get them back-to-back plays where they were able to attack that secondary. At last play, they put Keith Taylor into a jam where they had two vertical receivers. He picked the inside receiver, and it left a wide open man down the sideline. And converting that third down from inside the 10, and that kick is no good. He had made 71 in a row. Now he's missed two in a row. Seven-point game. Well, with a lead, they're playing a Tampa 2 defense. where they're going to drop safety here. Linebacker's kind of sinking here. You going to go back here with this safety But watch what it does to this defender right here He going to bite on this inside vertical route and then down the left That's his fourth penalty of the night? It is. He gets with Rashawn Evans right there. Well. All business. I use that line. I use that. It's the kind of game you want to have, you know, when nobody's watching. But what can I tell you? Third and 11. What can I tell you? From the 20. Give it to Foreman again. Now he'll get wrapped up. And that's going to take us down to just a handful of seconds. Or two hands full anyway. You know what I'm talking about. And Mr. Steve Wilks. Done a very nice job under very trying circumstances. Coaching staff gets ripped up. You trade away Anderson. You trade away McCaffrey. He's done a nice job. The team has not given up as well. You know, the combination of what he's doing. but there's some leadership on this team and some character on this team that despite a 2-7 start, they still show up every day to practice. They still show that they're engaged. And even after last week's debacle at Cincinnati, you can see that they showed up on a short week with a good attitude and ready to play ball. So 14 seconds. Fourth and ten. We have Pinheiro out on the field. You don't sense a block kick and a run back here, do you? From 37 yards. To put the final ball in. Yep. Makes it 25-15. Three more points, but it doesn't really take a lot of people to the promised land. A little bit shy. There you go. Updated. Tampa Bay 4-5. Atlanta goes to 4-6. Saints are 3-6. Carolina now goes to 3-7. Meanwhile, Atlanta had a pretty good opportunity. They did. You look at their schedule. Well, five games, counting this one, against teams that start the weekend with losing records. If they would have been able to find, I think that's why you see the disappointment in Arthur Smith's face. They find a way to win tonight. You look what's ahead of them. Yeah. Their division, who knows? I mean, this could be one of these divisions that 8-9 or 9-8 gets it done. Well, three teams in recent memory may feel, oh, beautiful. Huh. Okay. And a good way to wind up is concussion protocol, even though you don't get into the game. Huh. Oh, boy. Take one for the team, I guess. I don't know. Scooped up at the 10. Back to the 20. And one more play, and the parking lots will begin to empty. Steve Willis, this guy. Guys, we have one more play. Come on back. P.J. Walker bouncing back after last week. Just about consistency. I mean, he shows you. And in that room, they play for him. He's a leader. He's a winner. I mean, he was a winner in college, XFL, everywhere he's been, and had to show a lot of determination sitting down as the fourth quarterback when they got started in August. and now here he is, his fifth start of the year. Atlanta meets the Bears next week. This will pad the stat sheet and end the game. And Steve Wilkes and his team, after that bombing in Cincinnati last week, come in and knock off the slightly favored Atlanta Falcons. 25-15. Carolina wins it. Carissa and the guys wrapping things up on the Google. Sideline is Hodge all by himself. Well-designed play against that coverage. You can see Mariota's eyes. He sold it to the middle, moved the safety, and then came back with that throw. And they go figure that. 71 straight. It was the second longest current streak. only Tyler Bass of Buffalo has kicked more in a row and now he's got a new streak going Arthur Smith can't believe what he's saying here you've got all three timeouts you've got the two minute warning you've got a defense it's not been great at the line of scrimmage you kick this deep you've got a count on your defense getting it off the field to get the ball back to Mariota time to say don't touch that dial that's right there you go That's right. For Hodge, he lost 65 games in his career. That's his first touchdown. I know how much you love overtime. You love it. Listen, I'm here all night. What can I tell you, man? You love it. Why not? After the game 12 days ago. Exactly. High drama. We live for drama. Let's see what we get. And I can't wait to see how Carolina approaches this drive. If they continue to work with Foreman, They give Walker a chance with some high percentage throws. So Foreman starts in this set. Has the back. Takes it. About a three and a half, four yard gain. Second down, let's call it seven. and they stopped the clock at 2.50. Arthur Blank, the owner of the team on your right right there, coming down to the sideline. His team has just taken a timeout with 2.50 on the clock. The feel of this game, I've got to be honest, I can't believe that we're at 2.50 and Atlanta's in this game. They're within a possession. and it just feels like Carolina should be up by more it does, weird especially with that running attack when you can run for 222 yards you would think second and six tackle made can't get out of his tracks Evans is right there on Foreman meanwhile here comes the rain again there's Rashawn Evans We just talked about him and what he means to this defense. The last time this defense was out there, this time they're unable to get up to him. So you see Evans being able to slide through. Watch the guard. Can the guard get up to him? Can he help out? Or is Evans going to be able to sneak through? Nobody climbs to the second level. Christensen's occupied there with Grady Jarrett. And Evans does what he's supposed to do. Interesting play call here on third down. So the data one timeout, plus the two-minute warning. Very interesting call here. From the 28. In the pocket. Under pressure. Oh, and that's almost picked. And incomplete. Richie Grant is right there. But they used two timeouts. That possession took 13 seconds. Bring Evans. Safety knows the ball's coming out fast. He starts to come down. He doesn't see him, and he throws it right into his arms. Very fortunate Grant doesn't catch this. He walks to the end zone. Eckers putt. Caught at the 25. And returned by Avery Williams up to the 34 with 2.33 left. One timeout plus the two-minute warning a ton of time for the Falcons. Marietta 1 of 5 trailing, needing a tee-tee to tie or take the lead when he gets possession in the final three minutes. of the fourth quarter or overtime. You got that, right? Yes. Yeah. They sure found their mojo on that last drive. They got pinned back close to their own goal line after that great play on the punt, and then they put it together 97 yards. Dante Jackson is still out. Meanwhile, they start this drive. There's a run, and that's Avery Williams. Get out. Chennault. And then fighting his way, trying to get to the marker there. Tackled inbounds a little bit short. That's where you saw Chennault when he, earlier in the game, motioned to this look. And they had a couple blockers as receivers out front to block for him. And this time there's three defenders to keep him short of that first down. Go quick, make sure Atlanta can't make any defensive substitutions. get the purse down to the 35-yard line. Goes Blackshear, tackled by Evans. It's not as if P.J. Walker is having one of these huge nights for fantasy football owners, but you've got to be really impressed from where he was, of course, against Cincinnati, and even earlier when he made his first start when he took over, you know, against the Rams, he just is back to having a good feel for the plan and the decision-making, which was the area that he just struggled last week. With Mayfield and Darmold looking off on the sidelines. Good slip move. Boy, that's nice running by Foreman. Close to a first. And now 118 yards for Deontay. Again, good job up front by this big offensive line. There's the jump cuts, man. 235 pounds, elusive, kind of working his way through. Offensive line does their job, able to get off these arm tackles. Second down and one. And he's stopped at the line of scrimmage by Abdullah Anderson. So no game there, 12 minutes to go in the fourth 10-point lead. Third and one. He's right around exact same numbers that he ended up with the first matchup where he went 26 carries for 118 yards. He's right around, he's at 24 carries right now in 118 yards. Pretty good effort in his two games against his Falcons defense. Yeah, that defense, which was eighth in the league against the run, getting shredded tonight. Chuba Hubbard is in there. It's a keeper and a first down. keep referencing the offensive line and the push that they've gotten. They were really challenged this week by Steve Wilks. They knew that Mariota and Atlanta would come in and try to bully them at the line of scrimmage. And coming off of a dismal performance in Cincinnati, they have answered the bell in a big way to the physicality of this game. And coming across Once he induces the question Left tackle Offense number 79 Five yard penalty Still first out We put the full tie box on tonight Well I think everybody's excited to see a rookie First pick For this franchise First offensive player in the whole draft. What a bright future he has. But a couple miscues tonight. First and 15 now. And Blackshear. So they traded McCaffrey, but Foreman has done a great job. Hubbard had been hurt, but he's back. And Blackshear's looking pretty good tonight, too. That's seven carries for the rookie for 36 yards. It's like a back that's had 24 carries right there. He's in front of his jersey there. Just worn down. Helmet's got all kinds of work that's been done on it from the Falcons. That's the way you like your running back to look in the fourth quarter. Yeah. As long as he's in one piece. Yeah. Swing it up. trying to spin away but unable to do it is Chenault picks up a couple makes a third down and eight at the 22 D&P's calling the defense he had his defenders out there Walker could have handed this if he wanted he had the run but he felt like getting the ball back out to Chennault, but Dean Pease's defense, plenty of numbers out there this time. Offing it to the 14. Walker under pressure. Gets it away, and it's incomplete. D. Alford almost had a pick, and if he's able to catch that, who knows where he goes with that football. First really big blunder is decision making and Walker just trying to make a play not giving up on it. Look at 37 right through his hands. It's exactly what Atlanta needed to kind of catch a break like that. They miss it. A touchdown and an extra point would have turned it into a three possession game. Now they'll keep it at two. Pinheiro with a 40 yard attempt here. Made them from 46 and from 49. And there is the hat trick. 22-9. It's better for the team from that beautiful city. I think Atlanta has a quick score. Down 13, 9.22 to go. I don't. But we'll see. Fielded in the goal line by Patterson. Unless Patterson runs it all the way back. And out to the 27. Steve Wilts. Interim head coach. Boy, he ran that to perfection. And then his pedigree is basically defense. He looked like a first-round draft choice in that stuff. He looked good. 27-yard line. Catch is made up at the 32 by Michael Pruitt. Game six, let's call it. Second down and four. His defense is playing well tonight. Kaylee, what you got down there? Al, I talked to when I coach Wilt's high school teammates, his running back, Brandon Jett. And he told me that Wilt was the spark that led the Lions to the state championship in 1986. He said guys couldn't stop him in the bootleg. He was just too fast. Now Jett tells me Wilt is the name through all the conversations at West Virginia. You're around. Steve Wilt is a very impressive man. And this is a very impressive run right here after the 49-yard line goes Caleb Huntley. He's great to talk to. Intense. He looks like a head coach, doesn't he? Yeah, he does. He does. He has that look. Yeah. And, you know, think about, you know, you fire your head coach, Matt Rule. You chase, you know, the star player, Christian McCaffrey, trade out. Wasn't easy. Robbie Anderson has moved out. This team is playing with some energy until they got to Cincinnati last week. Right. Two previous games. And he had to fire two of his assistants as well on top of all of that. He's very good at blocking out the noise. Which you really have to do these days, don't you? Second and four. Oh, and incomplete and trying to come in with a pick was Thompson. Boy, he read this perfectly, and Mariota's staring down Kyle Pitts. Watch the vision and how he looks straight at his tight end. Shaq Thompson almost just baited him. He's open. Hey, throw it. Throw it. You got him. And then right before he throws it, he steps right in front of him. Mariota's eyes brought him to that interception, at least almost an interception he'd love to have back. 750 to go in the fourth. Third down and four. And down goes Mariota just getting a small piece. Meanwhile, the ball is out, but are they going to call this now? No, they're stopping the play. They're stopping the play. Crowd is in an uproar. They're running into the end zone. But you've got the only man that matters, Adrian Hill, standing there saying, come on back. Still can't figure out what Mariota is doing tonight with some of these decisions. Levu blitzed, trips him up there, and the body is down, obviously. Yep. And then he just throws it without really knowing, having any idea where it might go. He just decides to put the ball in the air. Thankfully, he's ruled down, so it's not the interception. Paraphrase the great John Madden in a way. One buttock equals two feet. I remember that. I remember that. Yeah, I remember. So it's fourth down and ten. And now you've got the offense staying out on the field in a 13-point game. And Carolina takes a timeout here. Ran a few times in the first half, but not here in the second. Derek Brown makes the tackle. Just a war daddy. Just a war daddy. This is what he did in college all the time to offensive linemen. This is one of the better guards, by the way, in the league. Chris Lidstrom went right around him with quickness. It's not just about power with 95. Again, a low snap. Mariotta's able to come up with it. Scrambles away. Can't avoid the sack. They just kept the pressure. Coming and coming and coming. Marquise Haynes with the sack. And that is the two-minute warning. And that's a nine-yard sack. And it's going to be third down and 19 from their own 25-yard line. Well, Al Holcomb and Steve Wilkes deserve a lot of credit for the plan that they have come up with when Marcus Mariota and this offensive line have been in obvious passing situations. They continue to just give him looks, create some confusion. That time the left guard, he's on an island. He didn't block anybody. He put all the pressure on Avery Williams to try to pick up Levine. We saw him move that launch point, move the pocket around, just to be able to avoid this pressure that they keep dialing up. so in effect I mean you got to go for it on fourth down here considering what the clock is so you don't need all 18 on this play but you try to get at least a chunk and they cannot do that intended for Zaccheaus and it's fourth down and 18 try to hit the split safeties there's an opening in the middle of that defense you got to hit it and you got to get the ball out in a hurry and put it on a line But a lot of traffic, it's got to be perfectly thrown to give your receiver a chance. There's no shot there into the teeth of the defense. Last gasp. Need 18. Have to get it out to the 44-yard line from here. London at 6'4", and Pitts at 6'6", on the left side. And Mariota will go down and get sacked. Haynes does it again. back to back Marquise Haynes Boy, I'm just confused here with the right tackle Caleb McGarry comes down to the inside here's the pressure he comes to the inside and worries about Derek Brown and leads Haynes who is so explosive and has such quickness off the edge gives him a running start and he had a great get off On that fourth down play, no chance by McGarry at all. His first two sacks of the season. The team has five tonight. Does Carolina. And now they can chew up the clock. Atlanta can stop at once. Foreman. To the 15-yard line. And that's their final timeout. it'll be down to the waning seconds by the time Atlanta gets the ball back if indeed they do next week it's the Titans and the Packers schedule's going to look pretty good from here on out we got the Bills and New England coming up in December we got the Raiders and the Rams we have San Francisco and Seattle so I'm fired up On Thursday night football. We see the Jets. We see the Cowboys and the Titans at the end of the game. It's the last to Ross. There you go. I promise you. It's coming. I never promised you a Rose Garden, but, you know, it's coming. I appreciate it. There you go. Second down and six. You're waiting with us. Foreman to the 10. Boy, what a night this guy's had. 30 carries, 30 for 129. Yeah, just kind of a tip of the cap from all of us watching this guy play, not just tonight, but fifth year out of Texas, and just a guy that had some injuries to fight through, really didn't find a home until last year with the Titans when Derrick Henry went down, showed enough there that Arthur Smith, who was in Nashville and worked with Vrabel, thought, you know what, we need a guy, or not Arthur Smith, Carolina knew that this is a guy that could run the football and kind of fit into the system that they wanted to run, and he's been a heck of a fit here in Charlotte. Yeah, that uniform tells you it's been a hard day's night. We'll take it to the four, but a flag will stop the clock. It's going to go against the offense. Holding offense, number 79. Oh, no. This Atlanta offensive line's been pretty good all year. But these blitzes that Steve Wilks and Al Holcomb have come up with tonight on a short week have caused a lot of issues with communication. A lot of times they've tipped their hand and shown, and they're not showing it and bailing. They're showing it and bringing it. And with that third left guard up front and Colby Gossett, You wonder how much that's really impacted some of the communication and the ability to pick up some of those blitzes. About halfway through the quarter, 4th down and 10. Got to believe they'll dial up some more pressure. And London going wide to the left. Algier in the backfield there's Pitts moving back and forth sitting in the slot play clock's down to two check and he sees those two inside backers got to play away just barely and then he is swallowed up Brian Burns who's had a relatively quiet night makes a lot of noise on a big play seven and a half To go in the fourth. 22-9. Carolina. And they have the ball. Meanwhile, Carolina can now start chewing up the clock. Foreman for a gain of one. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. Powered by AWS. Deontay Foreman has had a big night running the football. We'll see since week seven what he's been able to do with some of the yards because of his ability to break tackles. Tonight it's really been a credit to his offensive line. Only nine yards more than expected. He's been able to get to that second and third level running hard and running through those arm tackles. It's good to exceed expectations. Yeah. Second down and eight. Outside and making the tackle there is Rashawn Evans behind the line of scrimmage. Third and 11. And we've not called Rashawn Evans' name a ton tonight, but he's really become the main guy to lead this defense. I know he's frustrated, played at Alabama, has been a winner his entire career, coming over from the Tennessee Titans. They brought him over because as Dean Pease and Arthur Smith tried to build this culture on this side of the ball, an area where they'd not been great for years, they thought he could be a big cog in that defense. That Foreman doing something not done since 2009 with Jonathan Stewart. 200-yard games against the same opponent in the same season. Meanwhile, wrestled down is D.J. Moore. Felt him pretty much in check tonight. Fourth grab for him for 29 yards. Yeah, he had the big catch early in the game. And I think at that point, Carolina realized that they were going to have a lot of success running the football. and it's been a very different field than the game 12 days ago where he had so many chances. Yeah, he had that 20-yard catch, and then the other three were good for nine yards total. They had that one big catch by Marshall for 43 yards. Walker now at least is in triple digits at 108. Hecker is in to punt, and Avery Williams is back there. And they'll bounce at the seven. Can they save it? And yes. Sam Franklin. And Hecker going down there to say, man, thank you. What an effort there by Sam Franklin. Beautiful. Gets to that before he touches. Join the Panthers in 2020. He learned the vast majority of the homeless population in this city are military veterans. And as the son of a U.S. Army Airborne veteran, that did not sit right with him. So he has partnered with the United Service Organizations of North Carolina to provide meals for veterans facing insecurity. Pass here. Mariota tonight, 13 of 23. For only 103 yards. A little high, but a hold in. Catch made there by London at the 10-yard line. Yeah, you read those numbers with Mariota. This is just an offense that is built to stay ahead of schedule as far as the, not just the chains, but to score the game.
