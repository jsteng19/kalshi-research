 Make teams have to respect. Despite that, they've gotten to the playoffs. Wide open! Evans! Touchdown! 23 yards. It is the 100th touchdown of his career on 99 receptions. Baker loves that throw. Anytime he can get that corner route, especially to his guy Evans, He's reading this safety, and the safety comes down. Now he's got a one-on-one opportunity. That is a mismatch against a backup nickel there. You take that all day. You see Hamilton frustrated. What a tough ask for him to be able to stay with Mike Evans on that outside route. 99 receiving touchdowns, one fumble recovery. So there's your 100 for Evans. 10-17 to the half. Evans with the second touchdown pass of the night from Baker Mayfield. 53-yard kickoff return. Started it and gives the ball away. Good throw. At least to some Buck fans. From tonight, Thursday Night Football, off we go to the West Coast to Seattle. Seahawks and the 49ers on Thursday Night Football. And what has become through the years, one of the great rivalries. In the NFL. Big NFC West battle. San Francisco and Seattle next Thursday night. 17-14. Tampa Bay on top. Trenton Gill. Sends it skyward. Five yards into the end zone. Touchback. Down to Kaylee. Guys, Mike Evans keeps giving away pieces of Bucs history. To guys wearing number 13 jerseys. He gave that ball away Sunday when he became the Bucs all-time scoring leader. He told me he didn't even think about keeping it because he's only been thinking about getting and keeping his 100th ball. But, whoops, here goes another one. As you guys mentioned, that's his 100th touchdown. But he has got his eye on a career milestone of a 100th touchdown catch. So, the next ball is the one he's going to keep. We hope. We hope. Go down there and tap him on the shoulder and remind him, will you? He forgot that fumble recovery. Meanwhile, a little toss back here. Stopped through the line of scrimmage. Robinson thrown down by David. You know, you keep throwing the ball. During the commercial, watching the guys throwing the ball around, that ball is going to wind up on eBay pretty soon. You know that. Like you said, they're throwing it around up the stands. I can't believe it came back to the original owner. I guess it did. Knight is made in white hat there. He is fired up. Never seen a guy so excited about getting the football. Ready to go. All right, let's see a defense make some adjustments and try to get these quarterbacks out of rhythm. Both these guys playing great football. Let's go, let's go. Ready. Good protection. Open. Catches May. Off to the races. A gain of 19 for Kyle Pitts. The tight end. So they've gotten him involved tonight. Two catches for 50 yards. They actually move him before the snap. They move him from in line to out wide. There he is against the corner, but it is zoned, so he just gets underneath that. You know, it's 6'6". It's not hard to find him, but a good job, good hard throw that time. Gives him a chance there to get in between the linebacker and the safety after the catch. It is great to see number eight get his hands on the football for Atlanta. Still minus Drake London who went back to the locker room. And nothing happening. here, but then all of a sudden, breaking tackles again is B. John Robinson. Turns no gain into a six-yard gain. I think he got out of the grasp of Greg Gaines, who's a big, strong defensive lineman. Did everything right there. He's locked him up. Locking him up. Has him down. But that gives you an idea how tough and how physical B. John Robinson is. Second and four. fired and that is going to be holed in at the 38 yard line hits again with David the linebacker covering first down really nice to see Cousins getting hit the ball here and that time he actually worked that might have been his third or maybe fourth option he looked from his left came all the way back to the right to be able to make that throw get the first down again mentioned earlier the middle of the field where he is just feasting on this defense. He's now 10 of 11 early in this game for 156 yards and two touchdowns in the middle of the field. Cousins is now thrown for 202 yards in a quarter and a half. And this time he avoids the sack, but the ball is loose. And there's a scramble for it. Jordan Whitehead came in. Bucs think they have it. Waiting for a signal from the official. You also have a flag on the play as well. Yeah, that's intentional grounding. He got the ball out, but he threw it to nobody. I think he was willing to probably take the intentional grounding to avoid the potential of getting that ball knocked loose. That was a first and ten, which will now be... The quarterback threw a forward pass. However, there's no receiver in the area. It's intentional grounding. by the offense, number 18, 10-yard penalty, loss of down, second down. I'm sorry, Al, that last drive that they had, they overcame some penalties. There was a first and 20, there was a third and 14, two holding flags. They eventually scored. Watch the right hand. He just kind of flips it. Knew exactly what it was going to cost him. He just didn't want the potential of losing that football, so he just got rid of it. Yeah, just make sure that arm is coming forward. Yep. Which he did. Makes it second down and 20. And a stoppage here. A Tampa challenge on that play. So Tampa will now probably challenge and contend that it was a fumble. Tampa Bay has challenged the rule in the field that the quarterback threw a forward pass. Previous play is under review. Okay. Timeout on the field. And, you know, we should mention, you asked Terry at the break, but Atlanta actually recovered it, so if it is a fumble, the Falcons got on top of the ball. Exactly. After reviewing the play, the ruling on the field stands is called. Tampa Bay will be charged with its first timeout of the half and has used its first talent in the game. Like we talked about, it's very clear that you could see the right hand coming forward. Like we said, he was just getting rid of the ball, understanding he was going to get the flag anyway, so now they're way behind the sticks, as they were, as we mentioned, in the previous drive, who's got the touchdown. They have Drake London, who comes back out of the locker room. He's in the game. Robinson takes it to the 40-yard line. Kaylee. Yeah, guys, Drake London, as you can see, clear to be back in the game, but that is after he was evaluated for a concussion in the locker room after the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant watched the replay. You saw that video earlier where he then went and grabbed Drake on the sideline and took him right back to the locker room himself. But also this news that Falcons defensive back D. Alford, he has been ruled out because he does have a concussion. All right, and meanwhile that's Tykee Smith who got hurt on the last play, the rookie third-round pick out of Georgia who needs the attention. here before a third down and 14 when play resumes. I think he felt his own player that time, K.J. Britt, who was just running, chasing the ball, ended up hitting his own man just towards the end of the play. Good to see him up. That was a pretty big hit. Like I said, K.J. Britt brings it. He's not known for his ability to cover. 52 right here. Bang, right into the helmet. but Smith is up and off to the sideline. So he goes back to the bench. They're already minus their top defensive back, the great Antoine Winfield, who's been out now for the last three weeks with a foot injury. Tavier Thomas comes in now, in that secondary on the third and 14 from the 42. in the pocket flares it out here Algier and he gets taken out of bounds at about the 36 by Levante David fourth down and looks like Koo is going to come in after he had missed a 41 yarder earlier See if your name is Coo You don't know whether they're chanting your name Or missing a 41 yard field goal It's tough That's tough I'm feeling this one He's going to hit this 54 The ball to look right over the middle of this defense Where they do like to attack And put that right on the money for a chance for yards after the catch and a first down. Gain of 15. Now they hand this to Robinson, and he goes nowhere. Kniping into the backfield, making the stop. The Bucs, second down and 10. Tyke Smith, a rookie out of Georgia, picked him in the third round, makes the tackle. Doing a good job here, getting a lot of different hands on the football. You know, mixing up the formations. It's not just getting it to Drake London. It's not just to Mooney. They've tried both of them. You've seen Pitts, who this town has been waiting for. And to be honest, as a college football guy, Pitts is about as dominating a player as I've seen the last five or ten years. Love to see him get his hands on the football here early. Second and ten. Pass is thrown over the middle. It's caught inside the five and all the way to the end zone. Drake London for the touchdown. So they make it look very easy. only takes three minutes and six seconds, seven plays, 70 yards and six points. K.J. Brett's an issue in coverage. Servasier Dennis is out of this game, the starting linebacker. Brett is very good against the run. He's a downhill thumper as a middle linebacker, but in coverage they attacked on that opening drive quite a bit over the middle against those linebackers. Coup for the extra point. So the Falcons last week won the game against New Orleans. Did not score an offensive touchdown. And tonight it takes a little over three minutes and Atlanta's up 7-0. Of 25 a year from now, NBA on prime. First offensive TD in the last 17 drives. This is a returnable kick. Fielded at the four-yard line by Sean Tucker. And Tucker down the sideline. He goes for a nice run back out past the 35-yard line. Baker Mayfield. Quite the journey. What an odyssey. Number one overall pick by Cleveland. He was going to be the guy. Pretty good start there. Then it fizzled at the end. They went for Deshaun Watson. Let him out the door. Goes to Carolina for half a season. winds up with the Rams and kind of resets his career on that Thursday night a couple of years ago, leading a drive at the end of the game. Signs with Tampa last year. Does well enough during a three-year, $100 million contract. They start with Rashad White in the backfield from the 37-yard line. Off play action. Mayfield steps up. Fires caught on the other side of the 50-yard line, so they start hot. Mike Evans. There was a lot of talk going into last week's game that they weren't looking enough, or he wasn't looking enough for Evans. Then they hit him on the first pass of the game last week. Yeah, that's one way to close. He had three targets, I think, against Denver 14 last week. And here's his first play, a good way to get him involved. But, yeah, Baker's story's been phenomenal. Anybody who's about cheering for a guy and a comeback story and a guy that went through it, he'd be the first one to admit he had a lot to learn, grow up, mature. He looks through things through a different lens now at this stage of his career. on the ground. And a nice little run here for Rashad White. One of the problems they have had offensively is running the ball. White's been held to less than three yards per carry. We'll also see a lot of Bucky Irving tonight, the rookie. Yeah, and I think this offensive line, I think they're really a work in progress. Dealing with some injuries. You have Justin School lined up over there in the right tackle in for Gedeke. Lose some of the toughness. So they're really built, if you go back to Tom Brady being here, built to really help in pass protection, learning how to become more physical and learning how to run the football. On second and five, Mayfield fires and nearly picked off. Evans was the intended receiver. Terrell was there, passed out, thrown out in front. Looks like Mayfield's looking for a flag, wants to know why his receiver was held up. Let's take a look. This will be a good matchup tonight, Evans and Terrell. Terrell a lot of times will shadow the top receiver. A little bump there at the top of the route. I think that's what Baker was asking for because it definitely impacted him trying to work into the middle of the field. Terry kind of waving it off saying no interference for us. Terry McCauley who's here helping us every Thursday night. Thank God. No doubt. Third and five. Mayfield fires over the middle into traffic and that is hold in. and Evans, forward progress will net him a first down without question, Evans is the kind of guy who could be a first for the left side Robinson resets in the backfield third and five under pressure for the first time and down he goes sooner or later beat the VA with the sack the Bull Moose at 347 pounds how do you keep him out? Yeah, exactly. And Todd Bowles walks him up. See, he's got six uptight, actually seven if you include that defender at that second level. And then they drop, and it confuses that offensive line enough. And that's just Vitavia just being him. I mean, there's no chance. The thing is, B. John Robinson's known for his ability to pick up the blitz, but he's not picking up the big fella there coming in at 350 pounds. Man against kids. Vitavia busting through. Coup who kicked a 58-yarder to win the game on Sunday. This one from 46 is a flag down our first of the game. The kick for the moment is no good. The penalty, though, indicated against Tampa. And it was a fourth and 14. Ron Torbert makes his first call of the night. Defense, number 32. One of their penalties. Fourth down. Josh Hayes to the consternation of the Bucks head coach. Just lined up there, offsides. So now it's a 41-yard attempt for Kuhn. And this one, he misses that one. Almost an instant replay of all things. 58 to win the game last week. Two chances this time. Tonight, neither is good. We remain 7-7. Back in Atlanta where the Buccaneers came to town with just five receivers available tonight well now they're down to four that's Cameron Johnson on the bike he's questionable to return because of an injury to his right ankle that's the same ankle that led him to miss week three's game and Falcons defensive back Dee Alford he's in their locker room being evaluated for a concussion with the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant guys yeah there he is and Johnson was in for one play now the pass here is caught and off to the races goes Godwin cuts to the inside picks up a first down on the first play of this drive who missed that field goal he was 9 for 9 this season we show up and jinx him guy makes a game winner last week he gets a redo and still misses hopefully he'll get back on track how about that play right there the big thing they want to see from Baker Mayfield So let's stack weeks together. Let's be consistent. Man, he looked great last week, decisive, and tonight throwing the ball and giving these receivers a chance. Again, a good run this time. Breaking tackles goes Bucky Irving. And we talked about him providing a spark for that running game at 5-10. 195, fourth round draft choice from Oregon. Gain of 16 here. Yeah, you're going to pull around the guard and the tight end around. You get some good blocks there. Look at Godwin downfield. Well, actually he missed, but he's able to get in the way and utilize the quickness of Bucky Irving, who can accelerate at a very different level. I mean, he kind of runs with a chip on his shoulder. You mentioned he was at Minnesota. Most people remember what he did last year when he was at Oregon on a good year. Mayfield, the fake. Protection is good. Going all the way downfield and incomplete. Attended that time for Sterling Shepard. So Shepard had been on a practice squad, had played with the Giants, eighth year in the league, looked like his career might be over. But he and Mayfield were together at Oklahoma for one season. They were back in 2015. And it's good to see him get an opportunity to bring some energy to this team last week. And Baker that time, he actually had the safety biting up. He had that. That was a touchdown. Liam Cohen's setting that up because Mike Evans is getting so much attention that it brought Justin Simmons down, and he went over top of him. Wright Reed just misses the throw. Fired, caught, and just a little short of the first down. Chris Godwin, Justin Simmons, making the stop. That's as good a pair of receivers as you'll see in the league with Evans and Godwin. They've been doing it for years. No doubt about it. Now you add Irving and White together. But, you know, Atlanta's a little bit perplexing here in these first four weeks. They'll blitz, especially on third down, more than anybody in the field. Ballet Hall of Famer. Every year in the league, all 10 over 1,000 yards. Has to come out for a second here. What a great job of getting this ball out. Watch the safety here, Bates. He's feeling that 13, Evans is going to get this football. But because he got to him early enough, he's able to secure the football and then get down to take care of himself before Bates could try to dislodge the ball. Great throw, great read, and decisive decision there. So Evans come out. Cameron Johnson, a rookie out of Barton, comes in. Toss back here. And White will be shot down after a gain of one, making it second down, second, and nine for the Bucs. You know, you mentioned Bucky Irving. I think just the presence of him has pushed White a little bit more to run tougher. Get a player down. Yeah, that's Cameron Johnson, the guy who just came into the game when Evans had to go out. So he would be, in effect, their number four receiver tonight behind Evans and Godwin's own power. Evans is still out. It is second down and nine and nothing here. So, again, that running game, they're having a hard time getting anything going. And that's been the case on the last two runs here. Third down and nine. Yeah, keep in mind, this defense from Atlanta, their top middle linebacker, probably top defender, is Troy Anderson. He had 17 tackles a week ago. He is out with a knee. So J.D. Bertrand, who's a rookie out of Notre Dame, is in Caden Ellis. But that time, boy, both linebackers getting downhill in a hurry. But they will miss number 44, Anderson, tonight. Yeah, NFC defensive player. Watching that game last week. Everywhere. Like every play. Yeah, pick six, too. Third and nine. Caught and blocking out in front as he goes to the tight end. And that's Cade Otten taking it for a first down off a third and nine inside the 20-yard line. Tackled by J.D. Bertrand. A good job by Bake using his eyes here to move the safeties to give him a chance at that second level. Here's third down. They're going to dial it up. Great time to go to this call by Liam Cohen. And like I said, when Baker Mayfield looking left, looking left, moves the safety baits, and then dump it down to the tight end. He's got good blocks in front of him, and a nice executed play for that first down. Yeah, Otten had the game-winning touchdown in the game here between the Bucs and the Falcons last year. Mayfield fires its paw inside the five-yard line, and it's a first down and goal. Chris Godwin making the grab, and it's kind of funny. Look, we all know he's a great receiver, but when you're playing with Mike Evans, you're always going to be the second guy. Yeah, we talked about that in the meeting this morning. It's like he just gets overlooked. I mean, he is as consistent and as durable as you could hope for. It makes the tough catches. I mean, in traffic, 14 goes in there, not concerned at all about taking that hit and holds on to the football. And both these quarterbacks coming out on fire, throwing the football with great accuracy. And there's Cameron Johnson trying to work it out along the sideline. Meanwhile, you've got an injured Falcon down at the two-yard line. and it'll be a first and goal, and play resumes. It's Alford, so they have to take D. Alford, one of their defensive backs, out of the game before a first down and goal. This is the ninth play of a drive that began at their own 37-yard line. So if you're just tuning in, Falcons went down the field on their first drive Antonio Hamilton comes in number 33 to supplant Alfred at least for one play and they bring the rookie Bucky Irving in to the backfield known here early in his career as a really physical runner he's undersized 5'10", 195 pounds but runs tough so makes sense they would bring him in White still in there with him can move him out there you see him maybe moving out to the right Picked in the fourth round. Started his college career at Minnesota. Wound up at Oregon for two years. First and goal. Fake toss. Comes back the other way. Wide open. Touchdown. So Evans comes back into the game and scores. Well, each team with a beautifully executed opening drive. Liam Cohen, the offensive coordinator and play caller, taking a page out of an Andy Reid type of call here. Uses the eyes to affect with Bucky Irving and then comes back. Nobody picks him up. You can see Terrell, I think he's man-to-man. They're confused here because of that movement. Half of the defense playing man. Nobody picks up Evans, and he's free over the middle. Great call again, and Falcons with a heck of an answer here early in this game. The whole league, and yet they're not getting home. Only four sacks this year. And they're trying to see if they can somehow affect the timing and rhythm tonight at number six back there, Baker Mayfield. The back is white. Good pass catcher. And this time the pass is incomplete. A little behind. Godwin cannot haul it in. Mike Hughes covering on the play. Hughes, a former first-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings, and it's fourth down. It goes into the boundary here. To his guy, Godwin, who's got Hughes, who's soft. I mean, this is good on third down. He just doesn't throw the ball in front of him to give him a chance to make that catch. Ball just a little bit behind. Nothing Godwin could do. 53-yard field goal attempt now for Chase McLaughlin. Atlanta gets an 11th guy back on the field in a hurry. And from 53, McLaughlin sends it right down the middle. 1.22 remaining in the quarter. Tampa Bay on top 10-7, and we're back in half a minute. So Todd Bowles took over when Bruce Arians retired. Arians, of course, winning that Super Bowl title with Brady. Todd was with the Jets. Remember, he was the head coach of the New York Jets for four years. He was going to do a good start 10-6 in his first year, but then. But then. It happens to everybody. Right. He bounced around since then, got on the staff for Arians as his defensive coordinator and ascended to the top spot. And has taken this team to the playoffs in each of his two years at the helm. Trenton Gill to kick off. And the next play will emanate from the 30. We were in New York talking about Aaron Rodgers coming back from a torn Achilles. Kirk Cousins facing the same thing. This is him last year before the injury. You can see that firm back foot, that right foot, and pushing off of it. And now 11 months later after the surgery, still trying to get the confidence in that back foot. You can see the heel coming up off the ground a little bit. And what that does is it affects the velocity. And that ball's dying on him just a little bit if he's thrown it 20, 30, 40 yards downfield. So, again, work in progress, trying to learn a new system, trying to get confidence in that Achilles, and also working with some new receivers. Perfect illustration there. Swinging out here, Robinson avoids a tackle, picks up about six, Drake London threw a nice block to help spring him for a six-yard gain, second down and four as we took down to a minute to play in the quarter. Think about that. At 34 years old, you come into a new system, and people just assume it's going to kind of come together. Now tonight, he's 7 of 8 for 107 yards and a touchdown. He looks great, but sometimes it takes time to develop that, especially coming off of that injury. New system, new offensive coordinator. Second and four to the outside, looking for room. Not much there, and gang tackled. Bijan Robinson. To Kaylee we go. Guys, Matthew Judon drew a surprising comparison when describing Kirk Cousins in the locker room. He told me he's not like Lamar Jackson, but he's with the team like Lamar is in Baltimore. He's always had that reputation and throws here to Mooney to the 44-yard line, and that will set up a first down and perhaps the last play of the quarter. They can let it run down inside 10. They come up to the line of scrimmage, I think trying to draw Tampa Bay offside, if nothing else. And that's the end of the quarter. Good-spirited first quarter on Thursday night. 10-7, Tampa Bay. And it performs here. Oh, look at this. On the unicycle. She must have been phenomenal on the balance screen at one point. Man, she is something. It shows up to arenas, stadiums, everywhere. Very popular figure down here. Al Michaels with Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Harton. Start the second quarter. A first down here from the 43-yard line. Being chased on the move and throwing it away. Second down. We go to Kaylee. Yeah, guys. So, like I was saying, Matthew Judon told me Kirk Cousins doesn't stay hidden in meeting rooms like some quarterbacks do. He's in the locker room. He's hanging out like one of the D-linemen. But, yeah, his age still shows. Judon said Cousins will start talking about some old stuff. New teammates, new coaches, and a new offense. What's been the biggest challenge of this transition? Well, you said it. There's been change. Sometimes you take one step back and try to take two steps forward. But we'll be continuing to improve each week, and we hope to build on that tonight. Why hasn't this offense reduced to the level of its talent through the first four games? Well, it's never any one thing. I think, you know, we're building something. It takes time. and there's so many pieces that have to come together for it to be a sharp operation from the first snap to the last. And we've got a great opportunity tonight to do that. Thanks, sir. Thanks, Kaylee. Well, there is the train horn, and those boys are the twin sons, John and Marshall, of Matt Ryan. And there is Matt, longtime Falcons quarterback, led him to the Super Bowl in 2016, and he will be honored at halftime tonight. there are the standings Tampa Bay comes in 3-1 Atlanta 2-2 the Saints are 2-2 in Carolina with one win over Vegas with a mark of 1-3 Trenton Gill will kick off Atlanta won the toss and they're going to receive the coaches Todd Bowles with the Bucs Raheem Morris who was the Tampa Bay coach many years ago he got the job for three years at the age of 33 Most recently, the Rams defensive coordinator. And the head man here for the first year. Start with a touchback. 69% of the kicks in the NFL this season have resulted in the touchback. And so they start at the 30-yard line. Kirk Cousins. Washington and then Minnesota. Four touchdowns, four picks. I mean, the statistics really don't say much. He did, though, lead them to that come-from-behind win against Philadelphia. Every one of their games has been a one-possession game and has gone down to the wire. Yeah, and I think he just said it to Kaylee. I mean, they're still trying to find themselves. We mentioned that in the open. Tonight's a big opportunity against a very aggressive, blitzing, attacking defense tonight from Tampa and Todd Bowles. Start from the pistol. Robinson is the back. Handed to Bajon. Gets a couple. So Cousins, remember, comes up with Washington. He came up at a time when Robert Griffin had a spectacular rookie season. It looked like Griffin would be the franchise quarterback for a million years. Eventually it was Cousins. They go no huddle here. Then he goes to Minnesota. And now his first season in a Falcon uniform. Second and eight. Fires wide open at the 50-yard line as Kyle Pitts to the 35. And this is a story because everybody's wondering, where has he been? No catches last week, seldom used so far this season. They get him right into the action early. Yeah, hit this seam right here. Tampa Bay walks up a lot of pressure. A lot of times they show it, drop out. There he is right there, right between the safety and the corner. Just able to get them. I love this hurry up against an attacking defense. 32-yard gain to the outside goes Robinson, able to turn the corner and turn what might have been a short loss into a small gain, second down. You might have won. Atlanta has shown this a little bit, but Zach Robinson with a really smart, good indicator of what they're going to try to do tonight. I mentioned Todd Bowles is known throughout the league. A lot of defensive coaches that like to crank things up, and as a head coach, he still calls the plays. So Zach Robinson very aware of what Todd Bowles can do. And mixing in just to try to change the tempo. To try to keep Todd Bowles and his defense on their heels. Instead of being the one that's attacking. Now they come up out of their first huddle of the night. And on second down and seven. Good pocket. Throw is a little short but coming back he can't pull it in. That's Darnell Mooney. Pass was underthrown. Mooney picked up from Chicago. Jamel Dean covering on the play. It'll make a third down and seven. A good decision to throw the ball, bring him back, but he doesn't throw it to the outside. By bringing it to the inside, it allows Dean with that length to be able to make a play on the football. A lot of times, again, we're talking about the timing, the little things that sometimes maybe get overlooked. That's just a matter of putting that on his outside shoulder, and that's a nice completion. Ready! Raise your heart! Ready! Third and seven. Pressure coming from the left side. Throws complete. And inside the 20-yard line goes Drake London. So the Falcons on the move, much as the Bucs were against Philadelphia last week. Hot start. Yeah, they're doing a good job here mixing up their formations. Drake London will be all over the place. Good size at 6'4". Sits down in that zone. Makes it easy there for Cousins, who had time to throw the foot. Offensive lineman coming off that ACL. week eight last year against Tennessee into that backfield and he said he's down but just good quickness that time. Close but no challenge Second down and eight Blushed out Throws Flag is down. Ball up at the 46-yard line on that catch by Godwin. But. Yep. But. Judon actually got in there. School the right tackle held him. Judon knew right away. He turned around and looked at the referee like, can I get some help here? Offense number 77. Ten-yard penalty. Took him to school. Oh, no. Never mind. Bull rush here with a big man. Ninth year. Former Patriot. Just using that power and watching him look over his shoulder like, can I get some help? And he got the call. Evans on the sideline there. Flexing the left arm. Now to release this play. Four-man rush. passes climb in. White might have had some room to roam and instead slips down. So Rashad White taken down. Loss of two in the play. Evans comes back in. And third down 20. Pretty good catch by Baker with just a ho-hum right hand here. That ball got away from him. And you're trying to set up a screen. That can really mess up the timing. Allow that defense. They saw it right away. And so good job by the Atlanta defense. Finally getting this offense way behind the sticks after that holding call and then rallying there on that screen. Third down and 20. Have to get to the 47. Avoids the sack. Mayfield was looking the lateral for the moment and instead just keeps it and gets banged out of bounds. And is there a flag at the end of that play? And there is. That's Antonio Hamilton. You talk about a mental error. I mean, you finally get pressure. Their first pressure of the game. Let up! Right. Even if it's gray area, you've got to let up. Well, they had 20 yards to go. It would have been fourth and 12. To me, it's great they waved it off because you could see it was still just starting to go out of bounds. It's great. But on a third and forever, what's the point? What's the point in hitting him right here? Great that the officials were able to converse and able to make this the right call. But 33 Hamilton just caught a huge break. So Trenton Gill will punt. Jake Camarda has been their punter, but he's been struggling. So they bring Gillen, who's been kicking off tonight. And he'll punt here. Buccaneers' first punt of the game. Avery Williams back to receive it. And he'll call for and make the fair catch at his 21-yard line. So early if you can. Back to Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Atlanta at the 20-yard line. They start this drive. Off the play fake. Because he's throwing and almost picked. Good coverage that time. Jamel Dean with the play on Darnell Mooney. Well, it's the second time that he's gone back shoulder and trying to get the ball thrown to Mooney. And Dean in really, really tight coverage. Step for step, looks back, locates the ball. There's some contact there, but no foul. and back to a second and ten is Arthur Blank the long time owner of the Atlanta Falcons watching his man Cousins go deep downfield and he's going to be caught at the 50 yard line pulled in by Drake London his huge night continuing Cousins under pressure that time that's a game of 31 and Kirk is now 284 through the air. How about Levante David right here? He'll initially run, and then he'll give Drake London off to Jordan Whitehead, and that's where I think he loses the football. When Whitehead comes over to try to help out, there's no chance of him locating the football, and that time he placed it perfectly to London. A little toss back here from the 49-yard line, and to the 44-yard line goes Tyler Algier. Kaylee. Guys, these division rivals are united in their commitment to helping those devastated by Hurricane Helene. Kirk Cousins and Baker Mayfield are donating a combined $100,000 to the relief efforts organized by Team Rubicon. That's in addition to contributions from the Falcons' Arthur Blank Family Foundation, which gave $500,000 to that same organization and $2 million to the World Central Kitchen. The Bucks-Glazer family, they've donated $1 million to nonprofits helping victims. Really incredible work in support. And David and Nicole Tepper of the Carolina Panthers with a $3 million donation. Meanwhile, you've got Levante. David is down. He's been the Iron Man 13 years in the league. A guy who played almost every snap last week, and the heat index was like 108 in Tampa. Yeah, the right guard, Chris Lindstrom, got up there and made that block low on David. You're right. We were talking to him about, man, how do you play that many snaps with that kind of heat? You know, he just talked about how he just constantly working to try to get himself used to that kind of weather year-round. Nobody can get used to that. I said you must be on the TB12 program these days with Tom in Tampa. Second and five. false start offense number 65 5 yard penalty second down Matthew Bergeron the left guard well keep in mind on this defense not only is Antoine Winfield Jr. you see Levante David Servasier Dennis is out you have KJ Britt in the middle and JJ Russell it's been a real concern the middle of the defense This is where Cousins has done a lot of his damage. Russell comes in for David. Russell is number 51. Second down and 10. Extra man comes. Cousins fires to the outside. Nearly picked there. And that time it was McCollum almost had the pick wounding, turning into pretty much the defensive back instead of the receiver on that play. Yeah, he's actually just sitting there waiting for this. Sheenka right here does a good job just pushing the big left tackle Jake Matthews into the quarterback. They're hurrying up again here this third down. Third and ten. Cousins, time, throws, caught. It's short at the first down. That's Pitts, Kyle Pitts making the catch. The 43-yard line, seven-point game. Early third, lining up to go for it on a fourth down and three. And away they go. They throw. Then the pass. Open caught 30-yard line. Spinning around and thrown out of bounds at the 28-yard line is Mooney. Dean covering on the play. On a fourth down and three, a gain of 14. You know on fourth down, this offensive line, there's actually no blitz. There's four guys that are going to be able to come here. But watch the offensive line. They're holding on. The defense is doing everything they can to affect Kirk Cousins. They don't necessarily hit him, but they can affect him. He's falling off of that throw, but still has enough on it to get that ball thrown to Mooney. Looks right, comes back, doesn't want to give up on that fourth down plate. Doesn't have a lot on it, but enough to get it out there. And in one half plus five minutes, Cousins is throwing for 300 yards. That's a backward pass. It'll count as a run. Mooney stopped after a minimal game. Second down. I love how Zach Robinson and Kirk Cousins are mixing up the tempo. Zach Robinson, you know, it's one of the things he talked to me. I see when you talk about Sean McVay being his quarterback coach for so many years. What did you learn? One of the biggest things, first thing he brought up was changing tempos and how they can keep a defense off balance and on their heels. When you go up against aggressive defense like Todd Bowles, that's one of the things you have to do, especially on third and long or second and long, trying to go to those fast tempos, not to allow them to dig their cleats in to come after you. Second and eight. Pressure again. Gets it away. Caught! And that should be a first down. They go pitch his way again. He had no catches last week. And tonight, very much a part of the process. Five grams for 74 yards. Pressure put on that time by Whitehead. Double A mug look, and then they bring the safety on top of that. There's just not enough guys there to be able to pick him up, so great job of feeling that, knowing that the clock is ticking. Cousins knows one hitch, barely gets that second hitch off, and look at the accuracy tonight by 18. Man, he is throwing the ball so well. From the 18, off the fake, that's caught here, the experience in L.A., and I think he's matured and really grown, and he's a different approach to how he prepares, and now he's become more of a veteran that they count on for leadership and guidance. from the two can he get in no he can't Irving is stuffed at the one yard line second down and goal a little over three minutes to play and a pretty wild first half very entertaining this defensive line they don't have necessarily those game wreckers up front what they have is guys that can eat up the offensive linemen kind of stalemate them beat anchors That's why it's tough to run into the interior against this front three that they have. Good size. Second down goal. Brings White back into the backfield. And the Baker always a threat in that zone read to run the ball himself. Did it last week. This time backs off. It's White. And White gets tackled at the four-yard line by Clark Phillips. So that saves a touchdown. Third and goal. Phillips does a nice job of coming off of Godwin. He was out there. He gives up on Godwin. Great awareness that time not to be lured into the inside. Those three receivers were stacked up to the outside. They all went to the inside. It would have been easy for Phillips to follow them. Instead, eyes on Baker Mayfield comes off of him and is in great position to make that tackle. Takes us to the two-minute warning on Thursday Night Football. Tampa Bay 17. Atlanta 17. From the three-yard line. Running back is White. Evans split left. Godwin to the right. Baker throws to the corner, and that's caught. Sterling Shepard comes up with it. So the two guys who connected in Oklahoma years ago, Shepard off the practice squad a couple of weeks ago, pulls it in for the touchdown. Tampa Bay takes the lead again. Wow, was that a throw? I mean, you talked about the chemistry going back to 2015 in Norman, Oklahoma. He knew exactly where he wanted to go with his football. A great route by Sterling Shepard. Outstanding timing. Puts it right on the money. Wasn't bad coverage at all. Antonio Hamilton pretty close in coverage. He didn't have much room to get that in there, but he somehow threaded the needle. Chase McLaughlin attacks on point number 24. And with 1.56 to go in the half, 24-17 bucks. Watch as he moves out to the right. He knows exactly where he wants to go, back to that corner. But before he releases the ball, look at this coverage right here. That's pretty tight. and look where he puts the ball. I mean, that is an outstanding throw by Baker Mayfield. You see Shepard work inside, kind of hesitate, picks up, switch of coverage, and then gets away from Hamilton there with an outstanding throw again. That's a great look at it right there. I mean, he could not have handed that football any better to his college teammate. Well, we've had a few blowouts on Thursday night, but this is a beauty so far, huh? This is great. What a way to start the weekend in football. Week 5, first game of October. A couple of years ago, Shepard thought his career was over. Meanwhile, Mayfield, I think as happy as he's ever been. He indicated that the other day in our Zoom call. Takeoff here. We'll go through the end zone for a touchback. Baker has been on fire, doing a really good job. He's 12 of 15, 131. What I like is, talked about him being decisive last week against Philly. Liam Cohen dialing up plays, getting him a chance to be able to get the ball thrown. And he's mixing it up. It's Mike Evans, it's Chris Godwin, it's Otten. And we just saw Sterling Shepard make a nice touchdown with a perfectly thrown football. So he was in the zone a week ago, and that has continued. What they want to see is the consistency week in and week out. Played a great first half tonight so far for Tampa. Meanwhile, Cousins has been as hot as Mayfield throws, and that's incomplete. Over the middle, 10 for Ray-Ray McLeod. Cousins is 16 of 21 now for 214 yards, two touchdowns. It's an important minute 51 for Atlanta. McLaughlin for the extra point. Yeah, when you can get Mike Evans that open, that has to be a beautifully designed play. Exactly. Or a bust. Or both. 7-7. He'll be honored at halftime. Our Tony Gonzalez will be part of that ceremony. He's going to go into the ring of honor. That's great. What a career. Deservedly so. And Canton should be the next stop. This is Gill kicking off and a touchback. If you're just tuning in and sitting down, you see 7-7. Both these quarterbacks playing very well in their opening drives. Falcons' first drive against Zone, finding pits. They've been waiting for opportunities to get him the football. They were able to attack the middle of this defense. There's one to Drake London, then off to the left against the linebacker, K.J. Britt. He's reading the eyes and out of position. and London shows a little power there after the catch getting into the end zone. Look at that start, 3 of 4 in that opening drive. People have been waiting. 34-year-old came over, got a lot of good pieces around him, and the timing looks very good so far tonight. Off the fake. Ton of time. Right on the money. Mooney making the grab. That position. And beat Dean on the play. Nice play action. We just talked about the timing. They go heavy. Linebackers are downhill, both Britt and Levante David, so it's one-on-one. And that's a mismatch with Mooney's speed. Good job. And again, ball out in front there. Give him a chance away from Jamal Dean. No chance at all defending that. Gain at 20. Algier is the running back. He goes out into the pattern and takes the pass. So he checks it down. Tackle is made there by Yaga Diaby. Short gain, second and eighth. You know, you look around the league, a lot of teams have two backs. But I think you can make a pretty strong argument. If B'John Robinson starts to live up to his potential, what he can do as a three-down back, and you put Tyler Algier in there together, kind of a bull. They are a heck of a combo. And it puts a lot on a defense to have to handle both these guys for four quarters. Algier cuts it back. Nice run. Gain of nine. And a first down. You've got a nice yin and yang going in that backfield between Robinson and Algier. Yeah, and Zach Robinson told me, and I think it's a great point, Algier just kind of has a natural fit. They're an outside zone team, and Algier 25 actually feels this and reads this better than Bijan Robinson at this stage of his career in just his second year. You see that step? He put his right step right there. He reads it, feels it, and then is able to get north and south. He's just outstanding. And when he builds up that momentum just like that and accelerates through that hole, he is a handful for those safeties to come up and tackle. Great block by McGarry to pave the way. Pass is going to be caught along the sideline. Getting free again is McLeod. And that'll be another first down. He beats Tykee Smith, the rookie, in a 15. They continue to kind of mix some things up here. Really nice plan, breaking some tendencies. He's a lot more throwing here on first and ten and not just play action. That time it dropped back and getting McLeod there involved. That's ten and a half yards per play that Atlanta is averaging here in these first two drives. Cousin six out of seven for 102. Here comes Mooney. Mooney's going to throw, but nobody's open. Nobody home. Throws it away. It'll be second down and ten. Anytime a guy gets reversed and he's losing ground, everybody's waiting for him to throw the football. Good job just throwing that one away. About the only time Zach Robinson called something here in these first couple drives that did not work. Well, Zach came over from the Rams. There's Todd Bowles on the other side who loves to blitz in his years at Tampa Bay as the defensive coordinator head coach. He glitches on 47% of the running plays. The NFL average is less than 30. Right around that mark anyway. Second down and 10. To the outside goes this stroke. Caught to the 19-yard line is Drake London. Taken down there by Smith. That'll set up a third and five for Atlanta. Bijan Robinson now comes back into the game. in these situations with Pitts it's 6-6 in London it's 6-4 have some big targets to try to find down 7 they've not been able to stop Baker in this offense the Bucks have had the ball four times three touchdown drives and a field goal so they have moved the ball at will Tampa will get the ball to start the second hand. Cousins fires. Caught a little, well, short of the first down. It was his knee down is the question. Drake London making the catch, and his knee was not down, so they will give him the first down as he crosses the 40-yard line. Heck of an effort there, because like you said, Al, all over it, just short of the first down, the ball brought him back, and it looks like he might be a yard short, but his knee did not touch. Well, they're going to review it. No coaches' challenges in the last two minutes. Does anything hit? Nope. We don't see anything. No, that's clean. And again, Drake London at 6'4", 213. You know, he'll block. He's tough. Great catch radius. But it's what he just showed right there. You don't typically see that from receivers with great length. They don't have that ability to fight like that. and I think that tells you a little bit about his personality in his third year out of USC. After further review, the ruling on the field stands as called. First down. So 131. Falcons have all of their timeouts. Four-man rush. Caught on the outside. Goes back to London. Tackled there by Smith. Gained a six second and four. All three timeouts still from Cousins, a veteran who's been in these situations many, many, many times in his career. Good protection again. Pass a little thrown behind, but making the most of it. Making the catch is Robinson. He got away from Levante. David with exactly 60 seconds on the first down on the Buccaneers' side of the field. That's a sure tackler that the young back just made miss. And more importantly, picks up the first down and gets out of bounds as they cross midfield. Heck of an effort there. You think David's going to make that tackle. But Bijan Robinson prides himself on that first guy missing. A time he showed a little bit of quickness and power to get out of that. Yeah, David's only made 1,500 tackles in his career. But none there. First down here. Cousins fires over the middle. Open to the 39-yard line. Ray Ray McLeod. It'll be second down and two. Drop it in Tampa too. Good decision quick by Cousins. Just check it down. Take the positive yards. Keep it rolling. No huddle to the outside. That pass. That's caught. London continues his big night. And that'll stop the clock with 34 seconds. London has now caught six for 64 yards. And Cousins is on a 500-yard pace with 253 in the half. When Kirk Cousins signed with Atlanta, everybody was envisioning what he could be for this offense. And Raheem Morris, in the first four games, we've seen some inconsistencies as he's kind of working through timing. tonight. We're seeing the Kirk Cousins we thought we might see. That's fired over the middle. Chipped and incomplete. Trying to get that one to London and Whitehead was there to break up the play. Yeah, these safeties have been dropping on this drive, almost playing more of a prevent and then this time the veteran Jordan Whitehead does a good job of sinking and coming underneath, almost like in a bracket coverage. I think he's surprised Cousins that time by coming down instead of dropping back on that hash he came down and almost made a play there So second and ten Pinion practicing the hold Look out big big sack Logan Paul gets in there So Logan Hall pick number 90 and that'll be a timeout taken here their first, they still have two but a third and 18 forthcoming. Now 76 McGarry is fighting through a knee injury see that left knee, it's bandaged up pretty good, I don't know if that affected him there in that pass pro but boy Hall who had a sack last week people have been waiting for him again to have a potential to kind of a breakout game. Couple drives going backwards on this one back to a first and 20. That pass is caught, but for a short game, tackled inbounds is Mooney by Zion McCollum. Doing a nice job, third-year man out of Sam Houston State, ascending to a starting role. Once they let Carlton Davis out of the building, he went to Detroit. Yeah, he's kind of been there. He's back that third corner behind Davis and Dean and worked his way into that spot. the 14 that passes incomplete that's levante david makes his presence felt as he has so many times over 13 seasons in the league breaking it up third and 14 it's amazing to watch him play at 34 years old and his greatest strength is just his instincts and savvy and ability to cover you know that that's a big man and kyle pitts at 6'6 but look at that right hand and arm extend to knock that ball away and using his eyes on the quarterback to know when the ball is coming. Third and 14. Over the middle and making the grab at the goal line. Mooney in there. Touchdown. Fired into traffic from 25 yards out. On a third and 14. And Atlanta retakes the lead. Yeah, and because of the success they've had throwing into the middle, they actually moved the corner, McCollum, to the inside to try to help take away the potential of any receiver that's going to work in there. So you've got a corner working in there. By the time he turns around, because Cousins threw that on a line, he didn't have a chance to adjust to the ball. And heck, talking about adjustment, what a job by Darnell Mooney coming back to make that catch up in the air. Don't go Koo for the extra point. Cousins has already thrown for 176 yards with almost 12 minutes left in the first half 14 10 tonight only on prime stay tuned after we witness the epic conclusion to one of the best TV shows of the year speaking of rings of course the Olympic rings the Olympics held here in 1976 we're checking out London on On the sideline. Drake London being checked out. On the Atlanta bench. And he jogged back through the locker room. Keep an eye on his return. As this is a line drive kick that will be returned from the four yard line. Tucker. Works his way. Pass to 30. Still on his feet. There he goes. And finally tackled by the last man who can get him. So Sean Tucker, second-year guy out of Syracuse, Mike Abernathy, the last guy down there and saved it at the Atlanta 44-yard line. Game 53 on the return. This is what we've been waiting for, right? I mean, every time you watch an NFL game with the new rule, you want to see a big return. I'd love to tell you it's great blocking, but it was one, two, three, four, five missed tackles and good hard running by the back, the young back out of Syracuse in his second year. ran into a couple of his own guys he's running over everybody here's Mayfield throwing on the run, caught at the 40 yard line tight end Otten and he's breaking tackles breaking tackles all over the place inside the 25 he goes for a game of 22 that was the Baker Mayfield in his Tampa Bay offense last week against Philly they did a lot of good things getting the ball out in a hurry A lot of levels concepts here. Just getting the ball out. Giving it to Otten. Big guy. 6'5". About 250 pounds. Shows his length there to just be able to make the catch. And then he doesn't go out of bounds. Mayfield 8 of 11 for 97 yards. Otten scored 2. Toss back here. And stuffed it about the line of scrimmages. This is Rashad White by James Smith-Williams, second down. They're trying to get this running game going. You mentioned that early in the game. And without the get-a-key, the right tackle, it's been tough to really get that going. And yet, Liam Cohen knows that even though these last few years, really, it's been a tough look at it. The last 22, 23, 24, it's been tough. And like I said, I think this offensive line has been built more to be better at pass protecting than driving people off the ball. But it is something Liam Cohen wants to try to emphasize. And you felt it right inside the left upright. Yeah, 50-yard field goals in the NFL. A dime a dozen this year. 6'17 to the half. And we're locked at 17. Yeah, he just needed to move back a little bit, make him a little more comfortable. Like Aubrey last week with Dallas, I know. I talk to the kickers. You know, I go down in the field every week. You and I go down. I always watch these kickers are warming up from 50 like it's 35. I'm always just enamored with how these guys are hanging these from 55 and 60 yards. Easy. Time now for the Thursday night spotlight is presented by Acura. One, jump in. We didn't know this or see this. My gosh. This is Kaylee Hartung, ladies and gentlemen. She's crazy. About a week ago. We knew that anyway. Yeah. What is she doing? Who talked her into that? She looks like she's actually enjoying herself. She is. Kaylee, you're crazy. It was an absolute blast. You would do that again? I'm not going to act otherwise. I think one and done is good enough for me. There might have been some discussion as to whether or not I would try it live. tonight. Roll the tape, man. Let's get as much bang for our buck as we can out of that one jump. But yeah, right up from here in the Raptors, it's kind of crazy now being down on the field, looking all the way up that 200 feet. And they said Al's turn is next week, I hear. Yeah. Al Giroux. This is Cody Thompson taking that at the 19-yard line. Yeah. Meanwhile, Kaylee didn't even get any lessons from Tom Cruise on how to pull it up. Meanwhile, two years ago on a Thursday night, this was crazy. This is Baker Mayfield. What a catch. Who flies into Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon. He's with Sean McVay there, Sean, and Liam Cohn for 48 hours. No sleep. Learns the playbook. Comes into the game. Leads him on that 98-yard drive at the end of the game to win it. 98 yards, no timeouts, been there for two days. How in the heck does that happen? Knew the playbook all inside out or as much as he needed to know it. Here's Bucky Irving. And then before the game tonight, he's getting himself all hepped up by looking at Mike Tyson videos in his locker. Name a quarterback in the history of the NFL that to get his mind right. I love Mike Tyson. is watching Mike Tyson. I can understand a linebacker or a pass rusher or a safety, but here's a quarterback. It tells you how he plays the game. He's watching Mike Tyson pregame. Well, don't forget, he was head-butting guys in Carolina on their helmets with his bare head. Right. First down from the 29-yard line. Big hole. White. Still moving. White inside the 30. and taken down at around the 10-yard line by A.J. Terrell. So White comes in averaging less than three yards a carry and explodes here for 56. But to be able to run this counter play, the play side has to do a good job of being able to establish that to open up the guard and the tackle to be able to come around. Worf's pulling around, athletic as heck, nice block, and then he gets north and south behind the block at Cotton 88, and then he makes Simmons miss. This is what Tampa Bay fans have been waiting to see from White. We know he can catch the ball out of the backfield. And Bakes excited mentioning the headbutt. He gives it to White. Helmet to helmet. From the 15. Toss here. Room. Nice move to the 5. Goes Bucky Irving. Rookie taken down there by Smith-Williams. Look at these pieces. It's not just Mike Evans. It's not just Chris Godwin. Even the tight end, Otten, getting involved. White, you just saw in that big run. Bucky Irving, I mean, they've got pieces. And then you throw Baker Mayfield into the mix, and what he's been able to do as far as being able to distribute the ball and not block in to just one guy. It's a lot to deal with in this Liam Cohen offensive style this year. Evans top of the screen on the first and goal. And to the two-yard line, a hard hit there. stopping Irving from getting into the end zone. We talked about in the open, Kirk, I mean, this team, they have a ton of talent. A good veteran mix. A lot of good young players. They've got Mayfield playing. You know, maybe the top of his game right now. Two great receivers. Get a running game. Look out. Yeah, and I think Baker and Mayfield, we're kind of having some fun with Mike Tyson and the head-butting in Carolina, but I think he's a different guy after. And Judon will remind him that happened forever ago, which is like 2012. Well, right now the crowd is booing because they thought that should have been a personal foul on Cousins. Replayed it. No flag. Second down and ten. Fired over the middle. Into traffic and incomplete and busted up at the last moment. Intending for London. And we've got a flag. It's only a second penalty of the game. The other an offside on a field goal attempt Ron Torbert is tonight referee And he says Personal foul unnecessary roughness defense number 52 15 penalty automatic touchdown It's on K.J. Britt. Here it is. Right there. that's a shoulder to head there this is the previous play where Logan Hall after he throws it actually pulls back but anytime a quarterback goes down everybody's always leery of wondering if a flag is going to come in especially the home crowd to the outside Algier picks up another flag We had a penalty-free first quarter, and all of a sudden we're 17 seconds in. Al high-fived me at the end of the first quarter and said, well, one thing about that first quarter. What did you say, one penalty? Only one. Only one? After last week's game? Yeah, since then. I think there's been a flag on every play. Holding. Offense number 64. Ten-yard penalty. The first foul. Brian Newsel, he is the center. Well, he's got his hands full tonight against Gaines and Vita. Big, strong, powerful this time. It's Greg Gaines. He's a backup center. Only 301 pounds. And, you know, they run this outside zone. And when you run that outside zone, you're trying to get these guys to go laterally. And it's easy to lock up. There he is grabbing that jersey. Easy to lock up on him if you lose leverage. Makes it first down and 20. To the outside quickly, looking for a block, and working his way is Ray Ray McLeod, who's been around for a while, seven years in the league. San Francisco at one point picked him up from the 49ers, second and 12. He's an interesting player. I mean, he's obviously been more of a return man, more of a special teams guy, but Ike Hilliard, who coaches the receivers, was very adamant with the staff saying, let's give this guy a shot. We have Mooney at one spot. We have London at the other. We have Pitts at tight end. We got Bijan Robinson, Tyler Algier. We need that F position. And they wanted to give Ray Ray McLeod a chance. Pressure coming. Hangs in the pocket. Wide open. Caught. And secures the ball at the 20. And they go to Kadarro Hodge. His first catch of the night. So he is already involved. Six different receivers. That's a gain of 22. Simulated pressure by bringing here and dropping Logan Hall. That's not his forte. It's 6'6", 283. And once again, they're picking on the interior of this Tampa Bay defense. Whether it's, you know, whether we've seen Britt back there, one of the outside linebackers dropping back in coverage, but clearly Kirk Cousins and the play caller Zach Robinson trying to go after the interior of the Tampa defense. Fakes a toss, then does throw it. Coming back this way, and a nice tackle is made there, but a flag comes in at the end as you saw. Robinson makes the grab. Penley marker is at the 18-yard line, just past the line of scrimmage. I think they may get Kyle Pitts on a hold here. Holding. Offense. Number eight. Ten-yard penalty. You called it. This is after the completion, and B. John Robinson works his way back towards Pitts, and that's where he just obviously just grabs a hold of the defender that time, Tykee Smith. that's the one thing that really hurt Atlanta last week they'd get into plus territory and they would end up self-inflicting a lot of penalties that's why they didn't have an offensive touchdown last week too many mistakes pretty flawless in their first couple a second round pick a few years ago has the length and the quickness that time gets inside of McGarry and picks up that sack at a great time for this Tampa defense he played his college ball at Houston In fact, he was the first pick of the second round that year. Pick number 33 overall. Third down, 18 now. Good protection this time. And that pass is out of range for Darnell Mooney. So now you have fourth down. You've got a 56-yard attempt. They're going to give it a shot. Yep. These days. Yeah. Man, it's amazing. They were moving the football. Bang, bang, bang. And then the incompletion with Whitehead coming up on that bracket coverage and then the sack, and they lose all their momentum on this drive. Meanwhile, they were going to bring... Oh. They sent Pinion in now. It's a punt. First punt of the game. Cameron Johnson is back to receive. It figures to be a pooch punt. Backspin put on it. Fair catch goal for May to the 4-yard line. Shows you the respect they have for Baker Mayfield. The concern, if you miss that field goal, you give him decent field position, even though with just 12 seconds. Yeah, 12 seconds to the half, and we'll be back in 30. While we're in commercial, the Falcons were leaving the field. It went to zero, so Atlanta thought the half was over. And Ron Torbert said, the half is not over. Come on back. I don't think they had officially set the ball. Correct. 25 seconds on the play clock, please. Of course, Mayfield will now throw a 96-yard touchdown pass. Or won't. Little kneel down. Look at Big still wondering, are we good here? Yeah, the clock's running down, and Atlanta could take a timeout. Finally. There we go. There we go, boys. Finally and officially, Buccaneers will get the second-half kickoff. Buccaneers trying to go to 4-1. Atlanta trying to avoid going under .500. Tuzin's checking out what's going on. And we will go down to Kaylee. Well, Raheem, I know that last drive didn't end the way you wanted it to, but otherwise, what's enabled your offense to take off? You know, the offense is going, and they've been doing a nice job. We've been progressing every single week, so it's not unexpected for me. What is unexpected is we've got to limit these explosives on defense and on special teams. They got their explosives. They're getting it going. Their offense is going. We got to come out and fight our butts off the second half. Thanks, Coach. Thank you. Well, coming up after the break, it will be the State Farm Halftime Show. Carissa and the gang and Matt Ryan going into the Ring of Honor. Full coverage up. You try to get him to hold the ball instead of allowing those easy access throws where he's getting it out pretty quickly. He's a good protection tonight. He's going to get the ball to start the second half. Meanwhile, from a yard into the end zone, Bucky Irving is still on his feet. Out past the 35 moments ago, Kaylee was with Todd Bowles. Well, Todd, the Falcons offense has been able to be effective through the air. How do you adjust to stop that? We've got to play better underneath coverage, and we've definitely got to tackle better. We'll make some adjustments this half when we're coming forward, and we've just got to be able to tackle. The guys got to settle down, and we've just got to play our kind of football. What have you been able to expose in the Falcons defense? Well, we've gotten the ball out. We've got them in some fronts where we can run the football as well. And we've opened up some things in the passing game, and Baker's been sharp. Thank you. Yeah, Baker has been sharp. 12-15. Three TDs. Little fake to the outside. Then they give the ball off to Rashad White, who had that long run at the end of the first half. Tackled by Grady Jarrett. Gained a 3-second and 7. There's Grady Jarrett. He looks like he got his hands on the football there. Maybe he knocked that out of there. Atlanta thinks they have it. Justin Simmons' first one to get up and say that's Atlanta's ball. And, of course, you heard Torbert saying ball coming out after contact with the ground. And this is how we've been excited to see come back to his game. You see that quickness that he has, an ability to use his hands and get away from the offense. Go figure. London gets hurt. Has to come out of the game. Hodge hasn't played very much tonight. Comes in. Scores from 45. Oh, my gosh. What a night. What a night. for these Atlanta Falcons. And what a night for the old vet, Kirk Cousins. He and Todd Bowles there shaking hands. A lot of mutual respect. That ends up being 509 yards and four touchdowns for Cousins talking to Mayfield. 509 yards is a Falcon record. Breaking the mark held by Matt Ryan, who just went into the ring of honor today. And there's Raheem Morris. Obviously spent some time in L.A. with Bake a couple years ago for those five weeks. They'll see each other again in three weeks. Matt Ryan, what a night for him to be here, be honored. Really, for the night, oh boy, here he goes. His alter ego. A little swag surfing for the 36-year-old. So Mayfield showing no little effects of that twisted leg on the last play when he was in before this series. And a first down here, gained him 18 yards. Watch what happens with Chris Godwin when he comes in. Working there is condensed. Got a safety there. Now he's going to take the linebackers and the safeties with him. There's no one left. Everybody cleared out. So Baker Mayfield, after that sack, walked off a little gingerly, wondering how he might feel. This is usually in the game where Baker Mayfield will take over. Nice throw. Now a nice scramble. Fourth quarter. Tie game. Hands it off on first down here. That's White. And aside for that one run, White's done. Basically nothing came in with a, as I said before, less than a three-yard per average carry. but that went way, way up when he ran for 56. Make no mistake, even though it's week five, the start of week five weekend, there's a long way to go. But these are the kind of games you fight with 11.30 to go and you find a way to win a divisional game. Make no mistake how you can use this as a game where you can really rally together. So a lot on the line for both these teams here in this last 11 minutes. and out of the range of Otten and incomplete coverage by Bertrand. You know, the guy that's been getting some pressure here in this second half, we just showed you that next-gen stats as Liam Cohen tries to dial this up is Matthew Judon, 15. You'll see him with the red sleeves and, of course, most recognizable name on this defense as far as the ability to get after the quarterback. Baker Mayfield has been much like Kirk Cousins, working into the middle of this defense. An obvious target would be Mike Evans, but remember, Chris Godwin on third down is always an option for him as well. And the Bucs are going to take a timeout prior to a third down and nine. and what's at stake at the moment. We've got four games into the season, almost a quarter of the way through. In this 17-game campaign, Tampa Bay 3-1, Atlanta 2-2. Saints are 2-2. Going to see them in a couple of weeks in New Orleans against Denver that brings Sean Payton back to the big easy. And the Carolina Panthers at 1-3. You know, I'm looking at Bowles. I'm looking at Morris. You go back to that Washington staff back in 2012, and Cousins was there. Sean McVay's fingerprints are all over everybody's coaching staff these days. At 38 years old. It's amazing. It is. And how about both offensive coordinators? And the defensive coordinator, of course, from Atlanta, was in his quarterback room last year. And a few head coaches, too. Third down and nine. Mayfield avoids the sack takes off but is stopped at the 34 yard line so it's going to be fourth down pressured by Caden Ellis number 55 who's played every defensive snap this season for the Buccaneers and it's fourth down, fourth and six. He's the green dot, he's the middle linebacker but the reason they look at him as such a valuable commodity to this defense is because of what he can do on third downs. They'll bring him off the edge. This time he goes right through Rashad White, who doesn't do a very good job there in pass pro. They're dialing up the pressure here, for sure. 53-yard attempt. Chase McLaughlin. Again, makes it look so easy. Right down the middle. Right down Peachtree Street. One of 36 here in Atlanta. 30-27. Bucks on top. You're ludicrous. Me and ludicrous. I guess, well you see this like every week in college football. Something's going on. My favorite is the Wisconsin jump around. At the end of the third quarter? Yeah. Alabama was cranked up last week. Alabama-Georgia. Wow. What a game. What a game. You know, a pretty good one here tonight as well. Falcons at the 30. We'll take over. Well, Kirk Cousins has had a great game tonight. Just has really felt it. Talked about his timing being off just a bit tonight. That's not been the case. Not even, even when he's been pressured. I think he's had confidence to be able to trust London. And he gets taken down. Nice tackle, but a flag. Chris and Izzy in making the tackle. And we'll hear from Ron Torbert in a moment. Five black on a hold. Yep. And it's London. Boy, it's kind of a repeating theme for this offense. Move, move, move. And then penalties and self-destructing. There were two fouls during play, both by the offense. Ineligible player illegally downfield, number 70. That penalty has declined. Pass interference, number 12. That penalty will be accepted. Ten-yard penalty being seconded out. Excuse me. Repeat first foul. Matthews and Hodge. You're right. Finishing drives last year, this team was 29th in the red zone. Yep. That's a huge problem for them. these last couple weeks, you could see Hodge with the interference. He also saw the hold there by London. Red zone this year, you mentioned 29th last year, the 29th this year. Had their opportunities, see if they can finish his drive off after another miscue. And a person 20 now from the 28-yard line. To the 22 goes Bijan Robinson. That's his 8th carry of the night, but only 24 yards so three yards per tote Falcons have run only they rushed only ten times tonight and thrown 38 second and 14 Look out. Got him by the shirt collar. And down he goes. Anthony Nelson will get that sack. So Nelson making his first big play of the night to make it third down and 22. Nelson has tremendous length, good effort. But it was the coverage downfield that allows him to eventually get home. It's a double move by Darnell Mooney that nobody fell for. You see Jamal Dean kind of wait. Look at him. His eyes are on that quarterback. There's no chance that he's going to fall for that. He can see that little stutter and go, and he's right there. And that's why Cousins just ate it. Backed up again, third and 22. Cousins fires and reaching down incomplete. Tried to get it to Darnell Mooney. Throw was low, and it's fourth and 22. And in comes the field goal unit. We talked earlier about last year, before the Achilles, and then after this year coming back 11 months, Cousins just sometimes doesn't quite, now that ball could have been caught, but sometimes we can't quite drive off that back foot and the ball tends to drop on him near the end and it did that time. Like I said, Mooney could have made the catch, but the ball down low for him. Yeah, you illustrated that perfectly before. Trying to plant that back foot. 48-yard attempt by Kuh. Is good. With 6.21 to play in the third quarter on Thursday Night Football. We'll look at the last pass, which was dropped, and it's 24-20. Swinging or rocking to the music. Whatever. And the kickoff here. into the end zone. Time now for tonight's journey, and it's brought to you by Hyundai. So you've got Kirk Cousins, tremendous night, 315 yards, two touchdowns. Baker Mayfield, sharp, three touchdown passes tonight. Mike Evans, four for 49, two TDs, 100 now for his spectacular career. And the two head coaches Well acquainted with each other through the years Throws, caught, big game here Ball is out Evans is there, does he get it, does he save the day? And he does He's got one handed, punched out that time By Jesse Bates And then Evans is right there Great job there by Mike Evans. Locate that football once it came out. You see just blocking A.J. Terrell. Ball goes on the ground, clearly out. Anybody's vault, anybody's football came up. Right now you'd be looking at a 61-yard field goal if they don't get another yard. In the pocket. Protection's great. dropped. That time it's McLeod. Good tight coverage that time by McCollum. Yeah, McCollum looked like he might have gotten a hand in. That ball was thrown pretty well, but a little bit behind him. It looked like McCollum may have got that left hand in there to knock that football away. There it is. Yep, he does. Good play. Timeout on the field for an injured player. By rule, because this injury occurred in the last two minutes, Tampa Bay will be charged with a timeout. It's their second. That's Marquise Watts. And all that does, it doesn't do anything to the clock. Just toss him a timeout. So Koo won it from 58 last week. He might have to do it from even farther this week. Yeah, 12 seconds, no timeouts. You know, Koo last week wins it. Came in tonight. Feeling pretty good. This is second attempt from 41 early in the game and missed it. Here he is from 54. Stavier Thomas with that block. The career long last week, right? From 58. From 58. It's a little dicey here, too, though. You can't get tackled inbound at this point. Yeah, that's the tricky part. He's had a lot of success against the zones with the underneath throws, whether it's been Pitts or London. You make a quick throw. You get up to the ball and you fire to the ground. You're looking at five to eight yards is all you need to feel good about it. But it's got to really be fast. And in all likelihood, get to the boundary. They spread it out here. Out. Said they're going to go over the middle to the 28-yard line. That's Drake London. Can they get it? Spike. They can. with two, one second. So they got the extra. Look at Raheem Morris. Crazy. He is fired up about what his quarterback just did. I thought they got to fall down too far. I thought London might, as soon as he caught it, just take a knee. He kept running, and the clock kept running, but give the offense a lot of credit. Well schooled. They all sprint into the line. Cousins fires it with one second remaining. Tremendous. This will be a 47-yard attempt for a young home. Koo, who's had better nights, but he can salvage it here and send it to overtime. From 47. And they got a flag. They're calling it delay a game. They're calling it delay a game. They are. Delay a game by the offense. Five-yard penalty. Wow. So the play clock going, that's the last thing you're thinking about here is the play clock. I think they were thinking they were going to get a reset. Right. Terry, you hop in here. Why would they be thinking about a reset? I don't see any reason to, Kirk. Right. I mean, they got the ball down. They had plenty of time to get their field goal team out. They don't get a reset in this situation. And now they've got a timeout here from Tampa. Final charge out. Timeout. Temple Bay, this is the 30-second timeout. So now you go from 47 to 52. He's made two tonight from 54 and 48. Missed from 41 and 54. Do we go to overtime or do we go home? I'm still kind of in shock here that Raheem Morris is as well, that they pick up a big play by Drake London, and they're celebrating, and everyone's excited, thinking, wow, we did it. We fired the ball into the ground. We got the one second. Thank goodness we're all high-fiving each other. Meanwhile, the play clock has already started, and like Terry said, there's no reset. There's no reason to reset. Exactly. So here we go. Exactly. Too excited about what had happened. to the final play of regulation barring a defensive foul. 52 yards. And over. Mike was like, oh, we had him. Everybody think and run. The third down, 25. Falcons are down to their last timeout. Falcons go to Carolina next week. Then Seattle comes here and then at Tampa Bay. Tampa Bay goes to New Orleans next week. And then Baltimore comes to Tampa and the Falcons. Cedar, do you run here or go a high percentage pass just to make them use that timeout, that last timeout? Keep it on the ground. Make them use that timeout. Irving stopped at the line of scrimmage. And the final timeout taken with 121. So week five of the watch list. The Jets are in London with Minnesota. You'll see that on the NFL Network. In the wee hours, Green Bay at the Rams. Big one on Sunday. CBS NBC game Sunday night is Dallas at Pittsburgh. And then Monday night, the Saints go to Kansas City undefeated Kansas City Chiefs against New Orleans. Good games there. And a good one for us tonight. Here we go. Yep. Cousins is going to get his chance. He's done this and delivered many times in his career. Remember, all they need is a field goal. To send it to over, Johnny. He led that drive at the end of the Philadelphia game to win it back in week two. Koo getting loose. Trenton Gill for the punt. Put some backspin on it. Let's it bounce, and it takes a good bounce for the Falcons. Rolls into the end zone. in the 20-yard line. So the Falcons, every game has been a one-possession game. They lost to the Steelers in Week 1. Steelers kicked six field goals, a one-point win. There it was in Week 2 against the Eagles, losing by five and a tight one against Kansas City. And, of course, last week the 58-yarder by Kuhn. Didn't score an offensive touchdown, but still won the game. surprising thing is they've been getting pressure these last couple series without dialing up a lot of blitzes. They've been relying on that front, and it's been working out for them. Cousins throws a little behind him, but he makes the grab. That's Pitts, and Pitts is tackled out of bounds with 108. Cousins is now 394 yards. Pitts now seven receptions on the ninth. London tops at eighth. Mooney also has eighth. Cousins fires over the middle. Open there. Up past the 40-yard line. That's Mooney. Good job getting between the two linebackers there by Mooney. Goes right back to him after the drop. That time low throw. Holds on to it. 411-yard night for Kirk Cousins. Hangs in the pocket. Fires. That's caught. Trying to get out of bounds and then loses the ball out of bounds. So they retain possession Ray-Ray McLeod. But since he got tackled inbounds and then thrusted out of bounds, the clock keeps running. Looked like he thought about potentially, ah, he just loses the football. Right. and then he has to spike it with 21 seconds. So he was going to get tackled inbounds. He was trying to get out of bounds. Ball goes out of bounds, but the clock keeps running. By the way, Kirk Cousins on that last throw, you talk about you want to see a quarterback that's tough in these kind of situations. This guy's about as tough as they come. Logan Hall, who's been getting in there. Look at this hit after he gets hit low. He gets high. Look at that throw to McLeod, who hasn't had many opportunities to make plays, but he dials him up there with a game on the line. 30 career game-winning drives in his years with Washington and Minnesota. Two already this year. Third and one. To the outside and getting out of bounds. Crowd wants a late flag. They won't get one. London making that catch 17 seconds. Good recognition of a soft corner. Takes the easy out cut to London. Picks up the first down. and getting closer and closer to giving Koo a shot here to tie this game. But a good hustle play there by Mike Evans. Boy, did that play open up. A little play action move to the right. Linebackers flowed. It just wide open for Baker. So that's a gain of 21. The ball into Falcon territory. On the move. Throwing. Caught to the 40-yard line. Close to a first down. Goes Godwin. Yeah, let's take a look at our next-gen stats. It's powered by AWS. We talk about the pressure, what Atlanta's been trying to do. They're not afraid to blitz. The problem is they dial up blitzes. But, see, these last four years, they have really struggled. I mean, think about the last great pass rusher. I mean, we were talking in the meeting with Vic Beasley. I mean, John Abraham. I mean, who have they really had? And a lot of people were concerned when they didn't pick one this year at eight and went with Pennix. So I think it's going to turn out to be a great pick. Yeah, that's a whole other story which we haven't talked about, and we'll get to it when they have the ball, and Cousins is back in action. Here's Bucky Irving. Stopped at the line of scrimmage, second down at 10. You know, Jimmy Lake, who, of course, has been around the NFL in college. I thought it was a defensive guy, but last year goes and works with the Rams and was working on the offensive side. So he's in the meetings with Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay. As a defensive coach, he's helping them. He's learning. So now he gets into his chance to be a defensive coordinator. And after that experience, really understands offense is that much better. Mayfield escapes. He's going to run. And he's going to bang his way close to a first down to the 29-yard line. They're going to spot it at the 29. See if they give him the first or not. Instead, they're going to move the ball back. Or are they going to put it? And they're going to go faster on third down and short. They've got pressure by Graham. They're going to sneak this and just give it right up the middle to Irving. Oh, outside. Oh, instead, they sweep it to the outside and go to Chris Godwin. And flag is thrown at the end of that play. J.D. Bertrand was there, and he looks up at the board, which is a mile high here in Atlanta. You need neck surgery after looking at this thing. How about Godwin? He throws Shepard down. He's determined to get that first down, and then the rookie hits him late. After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary roughness. Defense, number 40. I'm not so sure Shepard didn't take the worst of that. He got drilled by his fellow receiver. Bang. First down, and then 15 on top of it. friendly fire Bertrand's the guy playing tonight in place of Troy Anderson who had that spectacular game on Sunday don't overlook that third down scramble by Baker Mayfield to get him to that second down scramble to get him to that third and short that's kind of the X factor that Baker brings and they don't want him to always rely on that but here and there, when it really opens up, you take it, which he did on that occasion. 3.40 to go in the quarter. First down from the 14. Stopped at the line of scrimmage. Bucky Irving taken down there by Grady Jarrett. second down. Boy, what a play by Cherry. Gets around Graham Barton, the center. Just quickness. Being able to watch the center trying to come back and pick up that block, but that is a tough assignment for a rookie for any center. Outside shade, and then just trying to get back to him. Such a quick first step. He's in the backfield before Barton can even turn to try to get him blocked and seal him off chasing that play. And Barton played at Duke. First round pick. 26th overall. Over the middle. That's caught. Tight end. Otten. A couple of yards shy of the first. Bertrand makes the tackle. Big third down. Third and two. A part of Atlanta's defensive scheme with the personnel that they have to work with this year with Jimmy Lake and Raheem Morris is you going to keep things in front of you Like a lot of defenses in the NFL these days And then you get teams into the red zone and you squeeze them You try to get them to force them into field goals and you don give up touchdowns Here's the chance here on third down. White, flanking Mayfield. Throwing it around to Mooney. He's had a lot of different guys involved tonight. What a catch there by Mooney on that touchdown. But this youth movement around him with London and Mooney and Pitts and Bijan, they've been all over this attack against the Buccaneers' defense. That's a pretty good night. Yeah, 3-51. Under pressure. Backside screen. Missed the tackle in the backfield. Gain of five here for Bijan Robinson. To Kaylee. Guys, I'm here on the Bucs sidelines looking at their two starting safeties on the sideline. Jordan Whitehead, we're told, is questionable to return because of a groin injury. And then, of course, Antoine Winfield out for a third game. But this is not where anybody wants to see these two guys standing. No, not at this point. Kayvon Merriweather comes in to take Whitehead's spot. Christian Isian is also in on the other side. Second down and five. Robinson. And he gets stuffed after a gain of one. So a third down. Nine and a half to go in regulation in a three-point game. And right now you've got Yaga Diaby who's down on the turf. player the abby really coming into his own they love him third-round pick out of louisville last year injury timeout back after this His last Thursday night. Meanwhile, a barn burner here tonight, as Frank Proyles would say. The late great Frank Proyles, 30-27, third down and forward. Diaby walked off under his own power. Cousins is back under pressure. Throws and pressured, and there's a flag. Contact at the 42-yard line. Levante David covering Darnell Mooney. At the top of the route, there's contact by Levante David. Really good coverage linebacker. But he just wraps up Mooney before he can even finish his route. Makes big contact. Watch 54 right here. I thought he might work to his left. He looked that way, comes back. There's the contact right there. Pass interference. Defense, number 54. Watch foul. Automatic first pass. They're trying to set that up with the motion by Pitts to open up the outside to Drake London to the left. He came off of it because of the coverage. Tried to get it in there to Mooney, and it would have had a chance, but obviously David there with a pass interference, so they got a first down. Embarking his displeasure, the officials. First down up at the 43-yard line. 9-19 left in regulation. Algier. Short game. You talked about Sean McVay earlier, his coaching tree. And if he's watching, I'm sure he's studying film, knowing him. But if he is watching or hearing about it, you've got to be really impressed with Zach Robinson. This guy's been a quarterback coach. Not like he was out there as a coordinator calling plays. This is the first time he's had a chance, former Oklahoma State quarterback, to call plays. And here he is, his fifth game. He's in a battle here against Todd Bowles in an aggressive defense. and the scheme that he's put together tonight has been masterful along with Kirk Cousins. Trust me, Sean is watching and looking at film. The baby's now too old for him to do the 2 o'clock feeding. Drake London picks up the first down. Another example of Cousins showing his experience. Watch him look right, thinks about it, comes back. And he's been doing this all night where he thinks he's going to go one way, comes back, and again makes a good decision. They go hurry up here, no huddle. Algier to the outside, and he will get wrestled down, hogtied by Anthony Nelson. Second down, and he flagged. Another penalty and plus territory for Atlanta's offense. Offense number 63. Ten-yard penalty. Repeat first down. Chris Lindstrom, he and McGarry, the guard and tackle, both picked in the first round by this club back in 2019. He hooks him and then pulls Gaines down. Outside zone going the other way. Trying to avoid that penetration by Big Greg Gaines. See that right hook right there and pulls him to the ground. So, again, we talked about how that's been a problem for these guys. Pick up some positive yards. Positive yards. Two steps forward. One step back. And back to go to a first and 20 from the midfield stripe. slinging to the outside and McLeod will go next to nowhere tackled there by Dean second and long upcoming took it down to the halfway mark of the fourth quarter here's Diaby coming back into the game Reset the play clock to 25. In the pocket. Rose caught. Pitts. Stolen his feet. Tackle finally. Forward progress to about the 37 by Dean. So that sets up a third and medium. Third down and six. Good to see again. The pits just getting some yards after the catch. Now they have a much more reasonable shot here at third down and six. Six-cash or something. After he gets to the 30. Fire and wide open and drop! Mooney! Open by a mile. Fourth down. what incredible anticipation here by kirk cousins i mean he throws this ball well before mooney even thought about turning around and i don't know if this is what affected mooney here or not i mean he sells this downfield but watch cousins when he throws this ball this ball's out there's your receiver all the way up at the top and he just i think the ball's maybe maybe past halfway and maybe Maybe he just lost sight of it. That ball hits him again in the chest. Right there. Here's a 54-yard attempt for Kuh to tie it. Blocked. So he's missed one, had that one blocked. Looks like Tavier Thomas broke through, knocks it down, and with six and a half to go in the fourth. It remains 30-27 Tampa Bay. It would have been a big first down to the 16-yard line instead. Yeah, and Dean falls. He's at the 15-yard line. If he catches that ball, it's not just the first down. He's going to walk around him into the end zone. Go ahead, score. That's a touchdown and a missed opportunity by Mooney. And then the blocked field goal gives half of the ball at the 44-yard line after the Tavier Thomas block. Meanwhile, that is knocked down. That's by Matthew Judon, second down. One of the other things that stood out to me in that play is love to see the backs. And Bijan Robinson, in his second year, gaining a reputation to pick these blitzes up, Helmets off. Look at him fighting to be able to make that block. And there's the drop again that would have eventually led to a touchdown. And here's T.R. Thomas just getting in clean on the right side, able to block that and keep the three-point lead. Second and ten. White. Decent gain here. comes up about a couple of yards shy. It'll be third down and two. White at 215 pounds is... We've seen a couple times we had a chance to be able to break through some tackles. That was a big one there to give him here at a third and two. Under six to play. Pressure. Escapes again. Slides to a stop at the 41-yard line. Man, when he needs to take off, he's been doing that all year long. Yep. You know that Atlanta, the book on them, they're the highest blitzing third-down team. But watch the rookie linebacker. This is what Baker sees. He sees him clear out. No problem. I'll take that all day. Third down, good awareness, knows exactly where he needs to go when that linebacker clears out. Easy path to the first down marker. From the 43 now. Pounce. Well, after the game, stay tuned, as always, with the JCPenney Post Game Show exclusively on Prime Video. Kaylee, of course, will have the star of the game, Carissa and Sherm and Wick, Fitz, Tony. the gang's all here yeah the gang's all here, they got a lot to talk about here plenty plenty there's a shootout between these two quarterbacks, it started fast Kirk Cousins with an opportunity to make some big plays in his first half Baker Mayfield matching him some great plays by these receivers downfield for both sides Baker was just kind of in his own, much like he was last week against Philly, look at that throw right there to his college teammate Sterling Shepard. Moody, I know he's had a couple drops, but he has made a couple big plays as well for Atlanta. And now it's decision time here. So you've got a fourth down, fourth and 15. The offense is out on the field for the moment. Remember, they did convert a third and 14 earlier. And I want to see if Todd Bowles is going to sit back and rely on the front to get home, or is he going to pressure? Have to get to the 35. London flanked outside. Going for it. Fired over the middle. Intercepted at the 35-yard line. Levante David. The heart and soul of that defense comes up with the play. Well, how fitting how Levante David, in his 13th year, in the play of the game, just sits back and plays almost a center field. Watch him just read Kirk Cousins. Sits back, he knows exactly where he needs to go, waiting for the potential throw, and then just steps right in front of that to make the interception. Diaby, a good job on the pass rush coming around on a twist. To get into the face and force that ball out by Cousins. David with over 1,500 career tackles. That's his first pick in four seasons. White goes nowhere. Gets slung down. And, of course, Atlanta will now have to take all of its timeouts. You and I were talking before. We thought with the three timeouts, maybe you see them punt it away. And then use the timeouts. And then get the ball back after Tampa would run the football. and now still have the three timeouts and obviously now they've got to still potentially do the same thing. They've got to hold them to a field goal and then they've got to drive the length of the field maybe down six points and try to get that touchdown to win it. Yeah, I don't know, fourth and 15. That's tough. Very tough. Pass was intended for Mooney. That's on the David's pick. Buck 39 to go. So if Tampa holds on, they'll be 4-1. Bouncy will go to 2-3. They put Bucky Irving back out there even after the fumble to show the confidence that they still have in him as a rookie. Give it to him. Secures it this time. A flag is down. Going to stop the clock. might have a face mask here. Holding. Nope. Offense number 62. Ten-yard penalty. Repeat second down. That's the center, Barton. Did they miss a face mask here? Let's take a peek. Yeah, it sure looks like it. Barton was definitely at holes, so it would be an offsetting. 162 on Grady Jarrett. Grabs onto the jersey as he cuts back. Instead, he got a second and 23 back at the 41-yard line. 133 on the clock. Still have the two timeouts. Going to throw a backside screen again. White just wants to make sure he stays inbounds. And he does. I know it's a gutsy call. I just happen to be looking at him live. Mike Evans snuck off. You know, they want to be conservative here, but this will be one Bake looks at when he looks at the film and thinks, oh, my goodness gracious. Land safe's alive. Protection breaks down. Sacked at the 15-yard line. on Yamata comes in to get the sack and Mayfield's shaking his leg as he gets up well they walked up five, even six guys and then they end up rushing three and dropping eight just trying to confuse the offensive line and it's a heck of a job Baker Mayfield I think anticipating some pressure and then they end up throwing him a curveball there by dropping eight into coverage and he gets twisted as well. McLaughlin 32-yard field goal attempt. Easy pickings and with 117 remaining in the third Baker takes a seat on the bench and he'll look at him 27-20. Captain. Little life that man has lived and incredible what he's done over the last 44 years, in fact. Yep. Building homes. Spectacular life. Well lived. Well lived. 27-20. Tampa Bay on top. And the Falcons will start at the 30-yard line. So, Atlanta this season playing these very close games. And again, now a one-possession game. And again, you can't make too much of an early season game. but either Atlanta can tie Tampa Bay at the top or they'll be two games back after five weeks. Yeah, they play in three weeks again. They do. So I think anytime you have an opportunity to play a division rival you obviously want to take a step forward because it matters so much when you get to the end. So you can feel that. I mean, you can feel some intensity. Everybody always talks about a short week and the defense is maybe having an advantage but tonight we've seen two quarterbacks that have played very well both incredibly well prepared and the schemes have been doing a great job of attacking these defenses. Cousins will flare it out here. Mooney, short game. Down to Kaylee. Guys, Baker Mayfield was slow to walk off the field after that last drive. You saw him, you know, kind of hobbling on his right knee but since then he's been back on the bench. He's had his head in the iPad sitting next to Liam Cohen, his offensive coordinator. He just stood up for the first time. He's kind of waved off any medical attention, taking a few steps up and down right now. But it doesn't look as serious as it looked like it could have been when he first got hit. For sure. Meanwhile, the backup quarterback would be Kyle Trask. Pump fake and the pass is incomplete. Well contested there in 10 for McLeod. Covered there by Tykee Smith. Third down and 8. Should mention the reason with the emphasis on the hip drop tackle this year, he did not come down on the back of his legs. That's why you didn't see a penalty come in there on that tackle by the Falcons defense. Now we've got a third down. Cousins, when he's had time, has been able to work through his progressions and find an open target. Pitts has been a great target tonight. It's been great to see he's off to the left and a three-by-one by himself. Pitts has scored five tonight on six targets. Looking straight over the middle. wide open making the catch at the 50-yard line is Ray Ray McLeod. Big first down on the conversion. Is he in making the stop? Because of that formation, watch how quickly Levante David clears out. And watch the Kirk Cousins anticipate this throw. Right there, wide open, right in the middle again of this defense from Tampa Bay. Cousins has really felt the rhythm, the timing, so much better tonight than he has at any point this year, these first four weeks. Waning seconds of the quarter. Big hole left side, breaking the tackle, inside the 30. Goes Bijan Robinson for his biggest run of the night. And that takes us to the end of the third quarter after a 29-yard gallop. Good game. Tampa Bay on top by a score of 27-20 as we head to the fourth on Thursday Night Football. Back we come here. It's the first down at the 18-yard line for the Falcons. Robinson. Sports a nice little hole there. Thrusting forward. Gets the most out of that. Run to the 12. Yeah, you're starting to see this offensive line do some work. This is right before the end of the third quarter. Watch the center and the right guard. Really nice job getting up to the backer. The right guard that time. Ligstrom does a nice job turning. Good time. 30-30. At the end of regulation. Let's not look back. This is a great shot by Koo here. Two weeks in a row with the game on the line. One time he wins it. Next time he sends it into overtime. Right down the middle. Clutch. He may have missed a couple earlier, but when it really mattered, he steps up. Let's not lose sight of the decision to go for it on 4th and 15. It works out for Raheem Morris. They have their three timeouts. They use them. They end up getting the ball back. No timeouts. Still down three. A chance to move down and get into field goal range. It's exactly what they did. We were playing one overtime period of up to 10 minutes. Each team will have an opportunity to possess the ball unless the team that first possesses the ball scores a touchdown. All replays are upstairs. If Atlanta gets a touchdown, the game is over. If not, it continues. Tampa will get an opportunity, or if there's a safety, then Tampa will win the game. so the kickoff through the end zone you know what was very big too at the when tampa bay had the ball at the end and they were clearly in field goal range but you had the holding call on barton they missed the face mask call that's right and that pushed way back he's out of field goal range made him punt instead of kick a field goal yep there's some you can go back and look at this there's some big plays there that gave Atlanta the shot that they needed to get this thing into overtime and now Cousins is thinking touchdown let's get out of here 440 yards 39 to 55 running back is Algier start with him got a yard second and nine That 440 you're talking about the most in a single game this year. The big theme this year is what's wrong with the passing, why the numbers down. Cousins tonight on a Thursday night, most passing yards in an NFL game this year. Second and nine. Up to the 38-yard line. Third down. Cousins career high 460 yards in that gigantic overtime. Not overtime. That game where they were down 33-0 to Indianapolis and came from behind. Third down. Third and three. Fired. Caught. London. To the 45-yard line. He goes. His giant night continues and he's shaken up. So London's now caught 12 tonight. 13 targets for 154 injury timeout. Now look at him off the line of scrimmage. Just kind of an option route. It's just up to him to kind of find that soft spot. And he does a perfect job of being patient. See right away he's feeling some pain. And he and Cousins, really it's the first time this year that we've seen Cousins in sync and on time with his receivers. Most notably Drake London and Darnell Mooney tonight. so a career high in passing yardage career high in passes 57 for Cousins tonight but he's going to lose London at least for one play Mooney scored 9 Pitts has scored 7 Kirk has completed 41 passes again it said earlier I'm going to say it again this is what Atlanta Falcons fans envisioned this is what NFL fans envisioned when Kirk Cousins signed with the youth around him when they brought Mooney over. London, obviously, Bijan Robinson. Just taking some time to kind of work into this rhythm. So, Cadero, Hodge, number 12, he comes in to replace London, at least for the moment. 45-yard line, Robinson is the back. Mooney moving. That's fired. That's caught. And that is Hodge. And Hodge is going to take it to the end zone. A most improbable win for the Atlanta Falcons. Bucks up 5-3. Keep it on the ground. Give it to Bucky Irving. That's a heck of a surge there, that left side of that offensive line. You know that they're going to run. You're in this four-minute offense. You're trying to work this clock down. And that Atlanta defense knows what's going to happen. Watch this push. This is an offensive line that's still trying to gel, still trying to grow, work that double team, get up to the linebacker. But a good push up front to give Irving plenty of room to get positive yards on first and ten. And for Tampa Bay and they're rushing problems, 153 yards on the ground tonight. Second and five. Play action, backside screen, Irving. Look at those moves. About a yard shy of the first down. Block ticking down to four minutes. Of course, every third down playing now becomes huge. I've got to tell you, that was a gutsy call by Tampa to throw that football. I mean, he gets it in there, but really, really tight. Fortunate for Tampa to catch that and get some positive yards. And here we go with another third down and short. Atlanta bringing in some big bodies. And Tampa as well with three tight ends here. Split Evans off to the left. Third and two. Play clock at four. Keep it on the ground. And fighting his way forward is White. So he's averaging about three yards a carry. That was a big time three yards. It was. It was, man. And you know what? Sometimes a three-yard carry on third down and three, that can fire a team up more than anything. Good job again getting up to that linebacker. He gets met easily short by Grady Jarrett, but that leg drive, it's not necessarily something White is known for, but here he shows that physicality getting those tough yards. Great job. Under three to play right now. Irving is the back. He has it. And a ball is out. And the Falcons say they have it, And so do the officials. Caden Ellis recovers it. There he is. Coming away with the ball. And Jesse Bates, the safety, comes up with a big play. You trust the rookie. He gives you good, tough running. You bring him in for White after that first down. And watch number three, the leader on the back end, coming in right here to dislodge that football. It gets out. And as Al said, Ellis is right there to pounce on it. And Atlanta catches the break that they needed. The fumble recovery has been confirmed. Police set the game block for 2 minutes, 50 seconds. Second forced fumble for Bates tonight. Several years in Cincinnati. Came over here as a free agent last year. Big time player. And Irving, who could have come close to helping to seal the game. They were using the clock perfectly. And now all of a sudden, 2.50. all the timeouts and the two-minute warning. So a ton of time for Atlanta. Algier smack as he crosses the line. That's Yaya Diaby coming in there. Choyinka also able to get inside that time of the left tackle, Jake Matthews. He initially blew that play up, forced Algier inside. Going all huddle here on a second down and 12. under pressure. Down he goes. All kinds of heat through the middle. And that's Logan Hall flexing his muscles. I'll tell you, Logan Hall the last couple weeks has just looked like a guy that can take a game over any time that he wants. With such length, he gets through the left guard that time and also the back. What a rush. Last play before the two minute warning. Algier to the outside can only get up to the 20 yard line. So now you've got a fourth down. You've got a fourth and 16. You're on the underside of the two minute warning with a buck 52 left. And a fourth and a million. But at least they have all their timeouts. So you would think a likely punt here and have to use their timeouts when Tampa has the ball. They're discussing that right now. It's a long way to go against a Todd Bowles defense that likes to dial up pressure in so many different ways. I'm with you with those three timeouts. And that gives you an idea of what B. John Robinson can do here. He feels that outside zone, breaks through that tackle. This is the second run that he just had. So has an ability to be much more physical than I think most people realize. He's very elusive, but he can get behind his pads as well. Second and four. Again, a little short. To the ten, it will be third down and two. In Texas, in college, he was a guy that ran more inside zone and more duo. It's a different field in these outside zones that the Atlanta Falcons are running. Seems like he's getting a better feel for it, better vision and patience with it every week. Well, it's Jordan Whitehead, slow in a rising. Whitehead had been with Tampa, then went away to the Jets and decided to come back to the better weather, among other things. So he'll have to come out for at least one play. and it will be third down and two for the Falcons Atlanta this season we're four and a half games into the season and they have never trailed or led by more than one possession so in other words eight points at any point fortunate to be where they are right now with the record out here More the power back comes in. You saw a shot there of Antoine Winfield. Servatier, Dennis, starting middle linebacker out. Britt in. Good to see Vitavea back. He got hurt in the second week against Detroit with an MCL sprain. Came back last week. There he is in the middle. Third down and two. And it's Algier, but he starts to stumble. And gets gang tackle. So again, they bog down in the red zone. McCollum comes up to make the tackle. Now you're down by seven. Now you've got a fourth down and four. And they're going to hurry again, trying to slow down Tampa from pressuring. Don't let them make any substitutions. To the outside, the pass is caught. Breaking the tackle into the end zone. Darnell Mooney, touchdown. 12 yards, Mikey Smith could not bring him down. What a job there. Having the luxury of having a veteran quarterback, you can go hurry up, take them out of that aggressive mindset. See Ray-Ray McLeod kind of sets the screen. Mooney gets in behind him. Made it really tough on the defender to stay with him. A good shake to the inside, back to the outside. Pulls away from Tykee Smith and into the end zone for that touchdown. About Channing Mooney's name, whose extra point is good. Our best Thursday night game of the season. Yeah, ball game. By 48 miles. 27-27. There he was in a Tampa Bay uniform. At that time, he was in Washington against Denver in San Diego after the 87 campaign. Touch back here. And, you know, you look at, as we take a look at this first, then we'll get back to Doug for a second. Go ahead. Take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. The first half, zero pressures. You know, the only team in the NFL this year with zero pressures in the first half. and then in the second half they've been able to dial it up a little bit more. Getting after Baker Mayfield, combination of some pretty good coverage downfield, giving them a chance to get after number six to try to slow him down and done a better job of getting him out of that rhythm. Mayfield in the pocket, fires over the middle, caught. Going to be a first down. Evans making that grab there. Evans tonight, five catches. You know, we were talking to Todd Bowles. We were talking about the Doug Williams game. Yeah. They won 42-10. They were down 10-0. So Bowles was saying he gave up. He got blamed for giving up a touchdown to Ricky Nathiel for Denver's first touchdown of the game. It turns out it was not. That was not his coverage on the play. He wanted to make sure you knew that. I said, I did the game. Don't blame me. No, it wasn't you. Can't give away who it was. From the 43-yard line. Mayfield stepping up. going to run with it going to get a first down and several more
