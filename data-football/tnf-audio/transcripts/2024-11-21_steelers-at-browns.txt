 And the Browns will start at their 30-yard line moments ago. Kaylee with Kevin Stefanski. Well, Kevin, you're off and scored on those last two drives. How do you want to continue to attack the Steelers in the second half? Yeah, this is a tough team. It's AFC North football. We knew this was going to be a battle. We have to do our job early on in those first two possessions as an offense. We had too many little mistakes, and you can't do that versus a good football team. Miles Garrett, a huge factor in that first half. T.J. Watt, essentially no factor. How do you continue that? Well, I'll worry about our guy, number 95. He's capable of doing what he's doing, and we're going to need him to do that to finish this game. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Kevin. All right, so Cleveland now starting from the 30-yard line. Winston throws. That catch is made by Jordan Aikens, the number two tight end first down game to 12. But does he look so well prepared tonight? What he's been able to do, and a big part of that is they've been able to neutralize T.J. Watt tonight. Not being effective in the first half as far as getting to the quarterback when he has been back there to throw. A lot of it has to do with he's either being chipped, being double teamed. You're seeing different guys coming around to try to account for him. So they had a plan. It worked in the first half. Let's see what T.J. and the Steelers can do to try to get him going here in the second half. pick up of about three on the ground Nick Chubb you know we haven't even mentioned this but Deshaun Watson of course was the quarterback towards Achilles and that's the reason Winston even got the opportunity he looks great and there again there's TJ Watts numbers of double teams and the 11 pass rush snaps that he's had so far you know he's itching to get after Winston Winston for the most part has been pretty clean back there He has moved around a little bit, but the line's done a good job of taking care of it. Play action. Under pressure. It scrambles. Throws on the run. Caught by Tillman. Loses the ball. Picked up by the Steelers. So Tillman had the first down. And then Dante Jackson will wind up with the football. Looked like Deshaun Elliott, the safety, came up and knocked it out. 25 right there. Put his shoulder right on the football and went right up into the air. Tillman is a physical receiver. Second year out of Tennessee. 6'3", 215. Just doesn't take care of the ball. It's a heck of a job by Elliott. It's just a classic tackle on how to rip that ball out. He just got his shoulder on it to pop it loose. Spung him around. He's getting fed on the sideline Making that sign So each team now with a turnover See who made the tackle Jameis Winston hustling downfield Brings him down From the 25 yard line Steelers Their first play of the second half Harris cutting to the outside Good move Lunging forward Picks up nine Notice he's a yard shy in the first down, second and one. One thing to remember about the Steelers, when they come out at halftime this year, they come out with really well-adjusted plan. They're outscoring their opponents by 80 points in the second half. That's second best behind only the Buffalo Bills. To the ground again. Knee to the yard and get it. And now the Browns think they came up with the ball. Fishers will come in. Nothing yet. No, down by contact. First down. You can see right now, he still has possession of the ball. He's down. Diff is down. Ball comes out. Terry McCauley indicating to us, down by contact. As Brad Allen confirmed. And it's a first down from the 37-yard line. He and a one for Najee Harris. Harris tonight carried the ball nine times, 26 yards, a little less than three for Kerry. The Browns are living up to their reputation with Jim Schwartz by outnumbering the line of scrimmage, putting as many bodies up there as they can, leaving their corners at times out there on islands. They have confidence that their corners can hold up. and up to the most part, they've done a good job of not getting beaten downfield. I think we had the one that Pickens made a great play on against Denzel Ward, especially in early downs. They crowd that line of scrimmage in that run game. Second down nine. Warren to the 40-in. You're looking at a defense here. They were number one in the league last year, fewest yards allowed. 32 for three on third down, and not this time, though. To the 38, Van Jefferson, former Ram, tackle by Ronnie Hickman. So now Mike Tomlin on fourth down, fourth down. Looks like a short two, long one, take your pick. Leaving the offense out there. Yeah, he's going to bring Fields out. And with Fields out, it's not just the quarterback's going to run it. There's the possibility of zone read, where he can read off the in-man, give it or pull it. They can run quarterback power. There's a lot of different things, not to mention what you said earlier. You can make, oh, he's going to run, and then pull it and throw it. So a lot of different options open up when two runs out there. They line up in a tight formation. Then they send Patterson all the way to the left. And Fields looking for room and won't find it. Grant Delpit comes up to make the tackle. Had a good game on Sunday. Down in New Orleans. Does it again here at 325 to go as they stop on fours down. Turnover on downs. Cleveland nothing Pittsburgh 53 Ouch And here we are From the 40 yard line After the turnover on downs The Browns start Looking for room, finding some Breaking tackles, goes Nick Chubb Let's go back to that fourth down run And you know, it almost looked like With a pulling guard, like a false pull He's trying to get something in here And then he ends up pulling it to the outside You got Miles Garrett, who ends up taking away the edge. And then you got Grant Delpit, who's doing a really good job there of making sure he can't bounce it to the outside. There's Garrett, and then you'll see nine setting that edge. Just nowhere to go. Again, give that defense a lot of credit with another big stop there. Inside three minutes to go in the quarter. Chubb again. Chubb took over a year off last year in week two against Pittsburgh. He got hurt. He'd already had major surgery when he was at Georgia years and years ago. Took him a while to get back, but he got back a couple of weeks ago. And, you know, let's hope he's fully recovered. He's some kind of player. Yeah, he really is. When he's healthy, he's as good a back as this league has to offer. That injury he had in college, it was devastating. A lot of people didn't think he would recover. He obviously did. And you hope the same will be after this injury as well. Third and two. Off balance, Winston throws. Pass is incomplete. Attended there for Cedric Tillman. So once again, the Browns, as we mentioned earlier, last in the league on third down conversions, and they're 0-2 so far tonight. The offensive line does a pretty good job here, you know, considering these pass rushers. Look at these two edge rushers and how quickly they get in there. He's got enough time. I just felt like when he stepped up, he collides with the guard and then got off balance, couldn't complete, and have an accurate throw there. All right, here's Bohorquez. His first punt was 12 yards. this a little bit better and it will take a nice little bounce to allow Cleveland to down it at about the 10 yard line 2-0-1 to go in the quarter so back we come 2-0-1 to go in the opening quarter Russell Wilson checking out the play the Browns could not have asked for any better starting field position right around midfield their own 48, their own 40, and then 2-3 and outs. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh stopped a missed field goal and then turned it over on downs. Start here, this drive. Harris, tackled by Maurice Hurst, second down. I think the story is going to continue to be, you know, both these offenses have to be able to run the football. You know, you can see the penalties for the Steelers tonight compared to the first downs. We're off to a bit of a slow start here. But Pittsburgh running the football to set up their play action to hit those big shots downfield. We saw one so far where Pickens was able to beat Denzel Ward. Second and six. Garrett on the sidelines for this play. Rolling, throwing, short throw. And a gain of about three that time to Darnell Washington. will be third down in a couple. Here's Kaylee. Guys, Steelers receiver Van Jefferson, we've just learned, is questionable to return because of the quad injury. He was on the injury report last week with that quad, played through it, but now it looks like it's bothering him on the sidelines. He just got off the exercise bike. That probably means more action for Mike Williams, perhaps. Third down in two. Meanwhile, the Steelers have a streak going that's in jeopardy. they have scored in each of the last 22 quarters. That's five and a half games. And that pass is pulled in at the 27-yard line. Again, it's Pickens with Ward, which will be a good battle tonight. He wins that one again, first down. Yeah, good position in this football. Allows Pickens to use his body to shield Ward away from the ball. And there's Wilson again. When he's on, the ball is out quickly. See, Ward gets there maybe just a little bit early, just playing the football. He's now 7-7 to get this game started. Russell Wilson for 77 yards. That's a pretty good start. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Keep your hand on the ball. We're going to take the quarter, okay? It's a good come-out roll. 7-7, 7-7. Anyway. You've got to coach me up on that one. One of these days. So they don't score it on Black Friday. Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung start the second quarter. First down for Pittsburgh here. And start on the ground here. With Warren taken down by Diabate at the line of scrimmage. Mike Rabel had been at Tennessee, of course, for a number of years. Got fired at the end of last season. People thought he might get a head coaching job. He didn't. So he's out there kind of like, you know, on the street in a manner of speaking. And going skiing or whatever he wanted. Kevin Stefanski calls him and he says, hey, come on over. Help me out here. Give me a little, you know, tutelage or whatever it would be. Yeah. He's on the sideline tonight. Yeah, Braves, he started off where he wasn't going to come out to much. Many of the games wasn't going to come out to any of the road games. And each week it seems like he gets a little bit more involved. This is Warren again. You know, you've got to give Stefanski credit. I mean, Stefanski's taking some heat as any coach would, too. Meanwhile, he's been in the playoffs twice in four years. He's got a ton of quarterbacks. You know, you bring a guy in and then the fan base starts to go, you know what, maybe we should get this guy as the headband. Let's give Kevin some credit here. When I learned Mike Grable was a great coach, he just got done winning the Super Bowl, came back to Columbus, and my twins and his son Tyler were about the same age. And he coached, I think, kindergarten football, and he talked to them the way he talks to these Browns players. And I was like, that guy's going to be a great coach. Get your ass off. I mean, he was just like in this politically correct style of coaching. That guy is a football coach, even with kids. Uh-oh. Well-respected. Getting open free is Calvin Austin with great speed and shows it there and takes it all the way down to the 25-yard line. Calvin Austin on a 48-yard bomb. And that's what he can do. This is a great job of being able to attack his safety. Delpit's athletic, and he can play in man coverage, but I think his eyes got messed up. He looked a little bit to the outside, and with Austin's speed, he's able to get around him. Look how close Garrett comes to getting that pressure on Russell Wilson. But that is a well-designed play and a great job by Russell Wilson finding the matchup against the safety. Austin ran a 4-3-2 at the combine. So he's a jet. Meanwhile, here's Harris breaking tackles but costing him. And the ball is out. And Wilson is there. And Russell Wilson is able to secure it. So Najee Harris fighting and fighting. And it's his first fumble of the season. And Lonnie Harris throughout his career rarely fumbles. That's the first of the season for him. You know what? If you go back in, the ball is definitely out. But if you go back to earlier, you could see Russell Wilson standing there just in case that ball came out. He was watching him and watching him and watching him and waiting for the threat. Look at him standing there just in case that ball gets popped out. It looked like Delpit may have gotten in there and knocked it out. So second down and 13 now. Pittsburgh. And Pittsburgh will take. It will be 32nd. A timeout, a 32nd timeout. But let's remember that heads-up play there. The great throw by Russell Wilson comes back. And just that veteran leadership there, just in case there's a fumble by Harris. Because if he's not there, even paying attention, that's a fumble and that's a Browns football. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, and this week Najee Harris actually told me Russell Wilson was the veteran that this team needed. He said the past two years the Steelers have been a young team, so much so that even when he was just in his second and third year here, he thought guys were looking up to him. Now he believes they have the one-up each week because of Wilson and his knowledge of specific tendencies of players, coaches, and schemes, and you saw it at work right there. Yeah, well, he's been rejuvenated himself. Not that he lost confidence. I mean, he's always a confident guy, but those two years in Denver are like, whoa. After those 10 in Seattle. Second down and 13. Off the fake, then he throws it to the outside. Flag is thrown, and Harris gets spilled to the 27. We'll hear from Brad Allen next. Field goal, but in the meantime, he ran the football intentionally, let the clock keep going. He's either going to work some clock or force that last timeout by Pittsburgh. Mike decides to hold on to that last timeout. So he could have had like a minute and 20 or so and no timeouts or 42 and one timeout. Interesting strategy. Take your pick. Go back and look at this third down play. T.J. Watt off the right edge of the offense just collapsing. We talk so often about both he and Myles Garrett as great pass rushers. T.J. Watt, because of that get-off, this is one where he's able to get down and get into Chubb, and he is so complete as an edge player. Well, here's Hopkins. He missed two last week and a third, which was negated by a defensive penalty. This one from 34 yards. The Horquez is the holder. And the kick is good. 40 seconds to halftime. Cleveland leading Pittsburgh. 275 pounds with that head shake and able to get around him. Here's the link to be able to knock that football loose on this last one. So you knew Miles Garrett would have opportunities tonight. See the eight matchups against Dan Moore. Three pressures, two sacks, and a forced fumble. And we're in the first half. Not quite the halftime yet. He's feeling it down there. He is. He is. I think he's in the home of rock and roll, baby. He's got to, you know, show some moves. Oh, yeah. He's definitely feeling it. And by the way, Dan Moore's a really good left tackle. He just, you know, if you don't have help, you don't have a back, or you're not sliding the protection that way, you're out there on an island. It's both he and T.J. Watt. That's no man's land. Pittsburgh starts from the 30. Can move into field goal range with one timeout. If you're thinking about Boswell's career-long 59 yards, they're trying to get around the 40, 41-yard length at the very least. Got to get inside the 40 to give him a shot. Boswell's one of those guys who's getting better with age. Doing this for a long time. Such a big part of their formula, too. I mean, this is how Pittsburgh's played for the most part, with the exception of two games. This is how they've played all year. You know, these one-possession games, they're five and two in one-possession games this year. So Wilson is 10 of 10 for 128 yards. Surveys, throws. He's 11 for 11. To the 49-yard line goes Pat Friar moves. There's the idea of saving that timeout here. Wilson's calling a play, trying to get everything lined up. Clock keeps moving. 24-23, chicken down, saving. Saving the T.O. to the outside, but not looking. So the two of them not on the same page. That was Van Jefferson, who was, Kaylee was telling us before, listed as probable. They're talking down there, Al, the officials, without a receiver looking. Sometimes you see the ref will come in with a late grounding call, but it looks like they're going to move on. It just looks like Jefferson and Wilson were not on the same page. As Wilson retreats, going deep, and there's a contact. And is there any flag? There is none. You've got Martin Emerson and George Pickens getting tangled up. Pickens pleading his case. They say, no, you've got 11 seconds. The thing that makes me always nervous about that is when a defensive back doesn't really have a feel for where he is and where the football is. Watch Emerson. That's the one aspect that makes you nervous that a call could come in. A little arm bar there, but no flag. Third and ten. Wilson. He's going to get sacked back at the 38-yard line. Miles Garrett. What a show he is putting on. Three sacks tonight. So we've seen him isolated one-on-one with Dan Moore. So instead of working out here, he works to the inside. Now he gets matched up there against a rookie, Zach Frazier, the center. Zach Frazier said, what did I do to deserve this? I thought he was out on the edge. The Cleveland Browns shot Baltimore three weeks ago. Trying to shot Pittsburgh tonight. Lead at the half, 10-3 to Kaylee Wego. Well, Coach, Miles Garrett has made his presence known. How do you quiet him down? They defer. Dustin Hopkins to kick it off. For Darrell Patterson and Jalen Warren are back for Pittsburgh. Temperature at game time, right at the freezing mark, 32. And off we go, week 12, with a bouncing ball. And if it goes out of bounds, we'll wind up at the 40. Instead, it's picked up along the sideline. And brought back by Patterson to the 22. Thought about letting it go, which would have brought the ball out to the 40, but instead has to pick it up. And here comes Russell Wilson. Ten really good years, of course. A couple of Super Bowls, one win, one loss in Seattle. Then kind of a forgettable stay in Denver for two years the first year. Totally forgettable. Second, a little bit better. Comes to Pittsburgh. There he is 4-0 when he got healthy. He took taking over for Justin Fields, who started the year, and went 4-2. Yeah, I think Arthur Smith coming over as the offensive coordinator, it's been a very good fit for Russell Wilson and the back Najee Harris. We'll see how they do tonight. Coming for the diamond formation in the backfield, and right off the bat, Shelby Harris takes care of Najee Harris. No relation. Second down. This is what the Browns need to do if they're going to be able to be competitive, we said in the open. How do they win? How do you compete? The defense has got to be able to make a difference tonight and being able to beat this Steelers defense and get short fields for their own offense. And I know that Jim Schwartz, the defensive coordinator, has aggressive a defensive approach as anybody in the league. So Jalen Warren comes in on the backfield now. Harris starts. Warren comes in on a second and long. A little motion here. They give it to Warren. He's having a heck of a year. And Warren busts one for 16. Tackled by Thornhill. He's a guy, you know, you've got Harris in the backfield. You overlook this kid. No doubt about it. You can see how sudden he is. It's a great trap block right here. Watch the left guard, Tim Alu, come over. Kicks him out. And once he gets that kick-out block right there, it hits downhill so quickly that I think that's the change of pace that you get when you get Jalen Warren in there. It was quick bursts being able to get to that second and third level of this defense. And he goes to the sideline. Harris comes in off the play fake. Quick throw, breaking a tackle, taking it out to the 40-yard line. Goes Darnell Washington. Big 6'7", 264 tight end. Good blocker, but they're going to try to work him into the pass game a little bit more. Believe it or not, this is what he looked like as a freshman in college. I remember when he was at Georgia, Brock Bowers was getting a lot of attention for obvious reasons. And all of a sudden, Darnell Washington came in and looked at him, and we thought, boy, he looks like an offensive tackle. Well, he's close to 300 pounds, but you said it. Great blocker, but improving as a receiver gives Russell Wilson another option. Tomlin is dressed four tight ends tonight. Taking him out the weather. He was a pass that's caught by Pickens. Tackled there by Martin Emerson, setting up the first third down of the game, third and one. This is Pittsburgh's attack this year with Russell Wilson. They want him to be just a distributor. Run the football, get the ball out of his hands quickly, and then from time to time hand it off to Justin Fields and let him take it over. Here is Justin Fields. There he is. So they put the code on Russell. Fields comes in. They have special packages for him. Mike Common telling us last night, he's not just Wildcat shotgun. He can throw if need be. Third and one. And that play is blown dead before its inception. Brad Allen, the referee. Full start. So that's Washington, and now Fields will come out, and Wilson will come back in. That's the risk you take as far as, of course, you want to get Fields in under those short yardage situations, but just the rhythm and the cadence of going from one quarterback to the next, just down at the bottom there, the tight end Washington, just a little flinch, just a small little thing, but again, that's the risk you take there by changing quarterbacks. And on the road, even though, you know, you would think the Steelers fans might even outnumber the Browns fans, but that's not the case tonight. On third and six, that pass is caught in between defenders. And to the 38-yard line goes Pat Friarmoove. And the Steelers fans who've made the trek from Pittsburgh serenade him. And they had him stacked. This gives you an idea of his skill set as a tight end. and he gets behind Pickens, just kind of works off of him, and then is able to separate away from Greg Newsome, who's outstanding in coverage, but a well-designed play there by Arthur Smith there on that third down after the penalty to give him enough room to get Wilson the ball. Warren is the running back. Warren carries. Good run again. Bounces off one Brown. Taken down at the 33-yard line. Bounces off Thornhill. Picks up six. Second down and four on the game's opening drive for Pittsburgh. Arthur Smith has brought, I feel like, an attitude. I think he's a perfect fit as an offensive mind. When he got let go in Atlanta, you look around the entire league, who could fit with what they needed to do. Remember the Matt Kennedy years, they just could not find that identity that really fit with Mike Tomlin, the great defense, and they have found that, I think, with Arthur Smith, with that outside zone game. We saw Derrick Henry when he was in Nashville with the Titans, and now it fits here in Pittsburgh. See the flurries meanwhile keeping it. Wilson taken down there by Ellerson Smith. It will be third down and two. Four and a half minutes into the game. Russell Wilson, 13th year. Mike Tomlin, of course. When he got the job in Pittsburgh, he was 34. He won the Super Bowl his second year. Got to the Super Bowl again in his fourth year. Rolling along. Incredible. All the coaches will tell you, it's one thing to get up there. It's so hard to sustain excellence the way he has. Three tight ends here. Wilson under pressure. Barriam. Miles Garrett wants to hear it from the crowd, and he will. Seven sacks coming in. That's going to make it fourth down and 11. It's going to be a great matchup all night. Dan Moore is isolated one-on-one. He got a little bit of a chip initially, but not much to slow down Myles Garrett. And that's great coverage that eventually allows Garrett to be able to get that sack. So it's a great combination of coverage downfield. Russell Wilson holds the football. That's a dangerous thing to do with Myles Garrett closing in. Chris Boswell is having a phenomenal season. This is a 58-yarder. He's only missed one all year. 29 out of 30, the one he missed from 62. A little windy, but not that windy. with the kick wide to the right. So he misses his second of the season. And the Steelers come up empty. Browns take over. 9-12. James Winston has it tipped and it's incomplete. So his first play tonight is a pass to the outside. You know, we were wondering about how much passing you could see. The weather forecast was worse than it looks right now. Yeah, we expected possibly rain throughout most of this game and then it turned into potentially slow showers. We're on the lake, so you really never know what to expect. We'll just kind of ride it out as this game goes. We just know it's cold, and Kaylee's holding on for dear life down there. Second down and ten. Handoff will go to Nick Chubb. Picks up about three, and then he gets slung back and slung down, and the crowd wants a flag. That's Peyton Wilson, the rookie out of North Carolina State, who made a phenomenal interception last Sunday. But nothing happens, and on we go. third and seven. It's obviously been a challenging year for this Cleveland Browns offense. They've had now after tonight eight different offensive starting combinations on this offensive line. That's the most in the NFL. Of course the whole Deshaun Watson saga. We'll talk about that. Jameis Winston has stepped in to give them a spark. But so many miscues and mental errors and there's another one on the offensive line. 12th start Offense number 75 5 guard penalty That's Joel Batonio The one guy who can really count him 11th year and he's been great Throughout his career The interior has been really the strength Over the last 4 or 5 years And they've been mostly consistent It's just been really on the edges This year though it's been a bit of a revolving door Trying to stay healthy And it's really impacted continuity You don't have continuity up front. It's tough to do anything. Four-man rush, third and 12. Pass is caught into Steeler territory. Goes Jerome Ford, but he is taken down well shy of the first down by Cam Sutton. So the Browns are last in the league in third-down conversions. What does it tell you? Among other things, you're looking at a guy who punts five-and-a-half times per game. This will be his 56th of the season. Corey Bohorkas to send it down toward Calvin Austin. What is that? A flag is down. Whatever that was, did the wind move it as he dropped it? The gunner ended up almost in the third row, so that's where the flag came in. Meanwhile, the kick was about 10 or 12 yards. And the Browns are... Boy, we've got to get our running game going. We've got to get our running game going, which we all know they want to do, especially with Nick Chubb. But they have not been able to do that. One thing they have been able to do since Jameis has been in there is throw the ball. Especially getting it out of his hands a little bit quicker than when Deshaun Watson was in there. So they tried the first couple series to run. Now they're able to throw it. Second and two. It's another first down here. You know, Jerry Judy who's back-to-back catching. I mean, Russell Wilson looks across the field and says, he was my guy the last two years. That's right. And, you know, with Amari Cooper being traded to Buffalo, Jerry Judy kind of takes over as the main go-to weapon now, almost wide receiver one for this offense. I feel like all three of these receivers with Amari Cooper now out, Judy and Cedric Tillman, Elijah Moore, pretty good group. Njoku throwing him in it tied in. A lot of weapons. We haven't seen him targeted yet, sooner or later. Maybe now. Over the middle. That's caught here by Jerry Judy. Tackled there by Joey Porter. So, Winston is now four of six, and three of those have gone to Judy. 15 yards. And the offensive line is doing a heck of a job here on this drive at giving him time. We just talked about T.J. White. How about that push up there at the top of the route by Judy? Look at the time he has. Accuracy there by Jameis Winston. You saw Porter touching his helmet, reaching his helmet, saying, Hey, how about that? Fish will see. 8.20 to go to the half. Ford is back here. Ford looking for room Barrels is what he may have the first time by the time this is over Crowd loving it. So Jerome Ford, they're going to mark him apparently a little bit short of the first. How about that? They get this drive going through the air, and then they're changing some backs, trying to get some fresh legs in there, and this is just tremendous effort. Still is trying to rip the football out. And Ford's just driving his legs, carrying defenders for another four or five yards. Second and one. Chubb back in. Keep it. Winston picks up the first down. Yeah, you know, Chubb is still really in the rehab process, in a manner of speaking, because, you know, he missed all of those games a year and a half. So they want to make sure they don't overwork him at this point. Yeah, I mean, he's one of the hardest workers. You know that he's going to be a guy that's never going to say no. He's going to want more, but it's just a matter that they have such gratitude and appreciation for who he's been. They are trying to ease him back, but he's told us that he feels like he's close to 100%. Pass to the outside. Short gain here, if any. Preston Smith, who was picked up recently from Green Bay, stops Nick Chubb after a gain of one, second down. Kent Dorsey getting a handle now as the play caller for the Browns, trying to find the best way to put a drive together the first couple series where they had great field position. They ran the ball. They ended up punting after two three outs. This time he's decided to open it up with formations, throwing the football. I think it's gotten Jameis Winston into a nice rhythm, and his offense has responded. A play of the drive. Three runs, four passes to this point. And on second down and nine, keep it on the ground here. head down to the 21 goes Chubb setting up third down I think the Browns would tell you that they've had so many injuries up front and what was supposed to be a strength which is their running game between the working Nick Chubb back the revolving doors of injuries up front I think they finally feel that they're healthy as they can be up front especially in the interior with Teller, Posick and the left guard Batonio So it's good to see. You're starting to see them get better blocking angles here in this drive as well. Four-man rush. Byers caught. But it's going to be a little short of the first down. Elijah Moore, just thinking a minute ago, hadn't mentioned Patrick Queens night. They picked him up, of course, in Baltimore. Just mentioned his name. Made the tackle. Well, here you go. You're at home. You're 2-8. You've taken on a division rival. You've beaten him four of the last five times here in Cleveland. You've got to go for it. Fourth and one. It truly is a home crowd here. I mean, even though Pittsburgh is 120 miles away, not too many terrible towels. Not as many as we normally see anyway. Fourth and one. Can they pick up the first? Indeed. From the 15 behind in a steady block. Chup makes it first and ten. that's a great job by Chubb feeling this excitedly going back to the bench as if we're gonna see what the penalty is this is what I saw I mean he went he went deep into the bench it's Beanie or you have Beanie Bishop there that just keeps getting pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed you know beyond the bench during the kick personal foul unnecessary roughness block out of bounds Receiving team number 23. 15-yard somebody from the end of the kick. It's first down. He called it on KZ. On this play, would you? Yeah, Al. Of course, it's illegal to block the gunner out of bounds once all four feet get out. But if we watch, the Cleveland player pulls him all the way into the bench area. Is he blocking or is he pulled in there? I could make a case that it was more of a pulled into as opposed to a block. And now you've got another flag for a full start on Pittsburgh. The Horkus punt went 12 yards. Then the personal foul is tacked on. Now you've got another five, and that full start is on Connor Hayward, whose brother, of course, plays on the other side of the ball, camp. Both these offenses, I don't know if it's the conditions, they're just slow to settle into this game. Another flinch here by Pittsburgh to get him behind the sticks. We saw Washington earlier, and now it's Hayward. So first and 15. It's Calvin Austin on the move. Into the outside with room to roam and a stiff arm there. Is Harris behind Isaac Ciamano to the outside. He goes second down and four after a pickup of 11. This offense, we talked about the fit of Arthur Smith, But I think in the offseason, in the draft, going out and bringing three rookies to almost reset this team and this roster, I think it was very intentional to go out and establish a certain toughness. They hit that with Zach Frazier at center. Mason McCormick starting at right guard there, 66. Both these guys, rookies. Short drop. Russell doesn't like what he sees. And then he gets pushed out of bounds by Jordan Hicks. and he'll make it third down and six after a loss of two. And if you haven't seen Russell Wilson play since his couple years at Denver and you look at his 4-0 since he's taken over for Justin Fields and you're wondering what is he doing right. I think what he's doing right, we saw it in the first drive, is when he's playing in a quick game and the ball is getting out and he's making quick decisions and the bootlegs and the waggles and the nakeds along with the running game, that's where they want to live. That straight drop back where he starts to kind of create, go back to his Seattle days, he just doesn't have that in him as often as he did in his younger days. Third down and six. Going deep downfield. And it's caught. Pickens covered well, but he adjusted to it. And Denzel Ward didn't. You have one of the top corners in the league going up against Pickens. And Pickens wins that battle. And on the third and six, they pick up 32. Remember, they stacked like this before. And he went to the inside route. This time he opts to go downfield. And the good thing here is great separation there at the end. Denzel Ward never is able to locate the football. What a job there. Nice throw to give him a chance. And a heck of a job of focusing on that football there by Pickens. To the ground. Over the left side. Jalen Warren for a couple. Pickens will use every ounce of his body on some of these catches. The right thigh got in play. The left leg, the right knee, everything it takes to secure that football, and it never touches the ground. So what a play. How about that catch he made against Washington a couple weeks ago? Unbelievable. I mean, he's capable of that. We've seen it over three years. Developing more consistency this year. Harris is back in there. Second down and six. Harris. One thing about Najee, he's as durable as they come. He started his first game as a rookie. He hasn't missed a single start since he signed as the number one pick back in 21. There's a lot to like about that. And, again, I think he's only going to get better and better as he has a feel. And I love how they continue to rotate him and Jalen Warren. Got to give Jim Schwartz a lot of credit. He knew coming into this game the line of scrimmage is going to be everything. Pittsburgh wants to run the ball. They'll try to occasionally get you with some play action on early downs. but he is sending his defensive line loose. He wants them to penetrate and create those negative plays. Steelers. But he is on the field right now, 18. Made a big catch a couple of weeks ago against Washington. Picked him up from the Jets. Long time former Charger. So here they go, fourth and one. Jalen Warren is the back. Blake Lockett, four. Wilson to throw if he can. Spins away. Fires. Caught along the sideline. Fryer move. The tight end. Gets free. Worked his way free. Garrett that time chasing Wilson and hit him. Not only did he chase him, he had a running start, and Russell Wilson knew exactly what was about to happen to him, even in the snow. Watch Miles Garrett almost spying him. Look at his running start. Lowers the boom right into his ribs as he releases that football, and look at that right on the money for the first down. That's clutch by Russell Wilson. Eight-yard gain. Markings are starting to get obscured here. Harris to the 9. Came so close to pulling that one out and heading to the end zone. Tackled by Isaiah McGuire. And McGuire had to hold into that right ankle. He almost slipped out of that. I think he would have made it all the way to the end zone for that touchdown. Remember, red zone, an issue for Pittsburgh. Will they come up with answers here? This is not Aloha Stadium, by the way, in case you're wondering. Second and 6. This is AFC North football, baby. It is. It's Ohio weather, baby. I love it. High snap. Recovers. Gets tackled at the 17-yard line. Jordan Hicks. So, again, the high snap from the rookie center. Zach Frazier. Nothing's easy right now. No, no. You know, it's not a matter of snapping it high. It's really probably the grip of the football as much as anything. Russell Wilson, just being an athlete there, is able to somehow come back down with it. But now they're way behind the sticks now in this third down. Third and 13. Have to get to the three for first down. Wilson in the blizzard. To the outside. That will be caught by Pickens, but well short of a first down. Emerson was covering on the play. Field goal unit coming out. Didn't even hesitate. Fourth and seven. Two and a half to go in the third. The division leader meeting the team in the basement. And the 2-18 Giving the Steelers all they can handle 28 yard attempt Thomas Waitman to put it down Boswell's kick If he can find it He's good I don't know, I lost sight of it Somebody had a GPS on it 10-6 Only on prime So, it's so obscure We're going to put in these virtual lines so you can see them, us two. Wow. Otherwise, forget about it. That's good. I'll put it out of you guys there. That's beautiful. Our boys, Mark Seidelman, the team man, Pierre Moussa, our gang in the truck. They're prepared for the snow. Helping us out. Thank God. From the eight-yard line, Jerome Ford. Works his way up to the 35-yard line. Kaylee, you making snow angels down there? What's going on? I could. I sure could. But, guys, I want to explain the significant advantage that the Browns seem to have right now as they drive down the field towards the left end zone compared to what the Steelers experienced as they weathered that drive to the right. Russell Wilson was getting absolutely pelted in the face with snow. I can only imagine his vision was obstructed because mine was as I tried to walk down the sideline that direction. But here with, you know, under two minutes left, they will switch sides soon here. But the Browns need to take advantage of this. Yeah, that's a good point. Very significant as they go with the win. Winston. Downfield reaching up. Can he make the catch? Juku. No, that is Blake Whitehart. Sorry about that. They just activated him. Blake Whitehart, 29 yards. He was just activated before the game. Oh, that Cleveland defense really responding here. Dalvin Tomlinson that time came in, flushed him out second and ten. Yeah, this is, again, as much about the coverage, Jim Schwartz is mixing up these looks so well, showing man, sometimes pre-snap show man, and then get out of it and play some zone. They're playing bracket coverage. They have Russell Wilson right now seeing things that's causing him to be hesitant that's then allowing that pass rush that time with Dalvin Tomlinson to be able to get home. really coming down now second and ten to the ground to nowhere Lauren again third and long Devin Bush makes that tackle under eight to play in the third you might sit there we put a graphic up showed you the drives and said boy if you're a Steelers fan what's wrong with Pittsburgh's offense to me it's what's right with Cleveland's defense tonight I mean, we can point the finger all we want at Pittsburgh. This is about a Cleveland defense showing up ready to play and incredibly well prepared. Without question. Number one in the league last year. Number 19 this year, but they look like number one tonight. Third and ten. Wilson going deep. He's got a man wide open. It's Van Jefferson this time. so Jefferson gets free down the sideline forget the elements, Russell says I'll take a shot deep downfield to 36 we just talked about how they're changing looks since they show one look pre-snap and then they change into post-snap see the corner gets fooled, he goes to the inside and stays on Calvin Austin and that slight hesitation opens up the outside to get it to where he really wanted to go to the outside, and man Jefferson makes a heck of a catch there Harris, no. Stopped in the backfield that time. The Abate makes the hit. Loss of a couple. Second and 12. Brought it up earlier. If you're a Steelers fan, you know that this has been an issue all year. They move the ball. And then when they get into this part of the field, things slow down. And they're not quite into the red zone. but they're 30th in the NFL in the red zone. It's a matter of still being able to run the football and getting the ball out of the hands of Russell Wilson quickly. You don't want him back there holding on to the football. Third and 11, flush out. Looks to the sideline. Scourge that sideline and comes close to picking up a first out. Tackle just inbounds I think he got it there He did, he wanted to give it to him Keep in mind, Russell Wilson is 35 years old He's in his 13th year Remember, he didn't play early because of a calf injury That's why Fields played And yet here he is Understands exactly where he needs to go There they might take a peek at that There he's definitely short of the marker But do you want to challenge? Yeah, it looks like they did bring it back. It looks like it is third and about a half a yard. Right, they did bring it back. Didn't need to challenge. Snow is for real now. Oh, shit. It's almost a whiteout. Third and one. Parrish. Uh-uh. No. And Klee went into position again to force it on downs with fourth down coming up. Remember, they're 0 for 2 on 4 downs. They've not done well in these short yardage situations, whether it's the conditions or the Browns defense or the combination of the two. So they're going to bring Boswell to kick this. Right. This won't be easy in these conditions right now. Kicking what would be into the wind. This will be 41, 42 yards for Chris Boswell. Go at 41 yards. And timeout is taken. And the play clock down to five seconds. This work has to use it. Yeah, this is important. You need to come away here with points, right? I mean, you're down to under five minutes to go into third quarter. Field conditions, the way your offense has not been able to finish these drives, you've got to come away with points here. So what are they going to do right now? Are they going to send the offense back out there? Or there's Danny Smith? Long-time special teams coach working on that gun. It looks like they're going for it. Now the offense is going to come back out. So fourth down and one. Interesting, Mike Williams has been playing a lot tonight. How about this call here on first and ten? And what an effort there to go up at high points as football in these conditions and come down with it. Went up against Dante Jackson. Big advantage with his height. comes down with that football. So White Hart 6-4 out of Wake Forest, second year in the league. Replace Jeff Swain. He's hurt. He makes a big, big play. Nick Chubb now. You know, not only has had a great play, I mean, think about 10-6 game, about under a minute here to go into the third quarter. If nothing else, what a job of affecting field position here. We'll see if the Browns do on this drive. But that is a big play and a great way to respond by Jameis Winston in this offense. Boy, they trust him in this offense right now. Half a minute to go in the quarter. Chug to the outside. Gets taken down to the 31. T.J. Watt, quiet night so far. Makes the tackle here. Sets up a third and five. We've got everything but the Zamboni out here right now. Big third down. Browns. Will they run a play before they switch sides? They do. Winston throws over the middle. Caught. Ooh. Breaking the tackle, but they may have stopped him shy. Tillman banged into Queen. they're gonna line it up see if you've got her enough take a look and that's the way the quarter will end 10-6 Cleveland wild one first McQueen hits him hard he stays on his feet tries to finish it came close by the way we were away they measured he's about four or five inches short so we'll bring up fourth down but he goes into the tent and the Browns offense up to this point anyway still out in the field you're right we need a Zamboni the shovels out like a changing fleets here the field entirely different than it was at the beginning of the game the Steelers have won two games this year where they not scored a touchdown. You know, last week against Baltimore, week one against Atlanta. Yep. Big fourth and inches. Jerry Judy lines up in the backfield. They give it to the fullback. And the first man through is going to pick up the first down. And Chubb, I think they end up moving in there a little bit closer just to be able to get downhill in a hurry. Nice thing what they did here too with Chubb behind him as the fullback and Judy to kind of be the window dressing behind him. Little eye candy there and they used the power of what Chubb can do. Pretty good blocks there on that left side to give him the room that they need. Again, Browns are playing to win. What do they have to lose? They're 2-8. Nothing. Exactly. The heart! 180! What's up? from the 23 open making the catch to the 5 yard line Jordan Aikens so on this drive Aikens the number 2 tight end and White Hart the number 3 tight end to meet the big plays with a center field safety watch Winston hit this seam round between the safety and the corner gets it out quickly gives his tight end a chance to not only catch the ball but to be able to protect himself from that hit from Minka Good job again, man. Jameis Winston seeing the coverage tonight from Pittsburgh, even in these conditions. 14 of 17 is Winston on the ground. Chugging his way. Can they stop him? They do. At about the 1 1⁄2 is Nick Chubb's second down and goal. You're talking such a big difference between 17-6 and 13-6. Especially in this weather. Yeah, and the weather late in the game Pittsburgh offense. It's struggling to to finish drives off Jump into the locker room Drive started at their own 35 Bring in two linemen both eligible here Listen looks over that clock which is down to four three on the play clock This ball could bounce or it could be a cutback out this way. Watch the vision here. He's going to read the block at the left side here. The linemen are able to use their leverage there, the left tackle. Really good job there. He's had played a lot. Fetty is a right tackle playing left tackle, but does a heck of a job there to help him out. And there's Patrick Queen who is down. So an injury timeout as they work on Queen with a little less than five to go in the half. 3-0 Steelers. You've got Patrick Queen is back on the bench. Peyton Wilson takes his spot. It's first down from the 11-yard line. Winston will throw. Caught on the outside. Diving to the 1-yard line. And Jokun with his first catch of the night. So sooner or later, you know they would go to him. And Wilson or Winston is now 7-9 for 63. Jokun right here. First and 10. You've got three tight ends in the game. It's a great look to show that you're running the football. And they bust a trend there with Ken Dorsey with the play action. The eyes of the defense in the backfield. The Joku able to slip out of that left flat. Nobody picks him up. Great call there by Ken Dorsey. Green is back in the game. Missed one play. Bring a fullback in here. From the one. Shove. Scores. To the end zone goes Nick. And Cleveland takes the lead. How about that? Two quick three and outs. And then 12 plays 80 yards. A little bit front. And you've got to give Dorsey a lot of credit for the adjustments they've made within the games. This is an offense that, again, they're very confident. what they can do with Jameis Winston. Quick decisions, ball out. They feel they can win some matchups out on the perimeter. And then once they did that, they're able to get back to running the football. Real good balance on that attack there to lead to that touchdown. That's the Hopkins point effort is good. Jameis Winston on that drive, six out of six for 55 yards. Four minutes to halftime, back in 30 seconds. Eight and two against two and eight. yet one team is only favored by three and a half, maybe four points. You know, you talk about a trap game and what that means and all that stuff. Is Pittsburgh, I guess you can look ahead in a way, but right now took a 3-0 lead, you have an 80-yard drive. What can you say? Well, for Pittsburgh, it's about putting points. They've got to score touchdowns. They can't kick field goals no matter who they're playing. They've got to be able to get on the road and be able to put, once they cross midfield, continue their execution and not be satisfied and settle for field goals. The other thing that stood out to me on that last drive, that looked like the Browns' offensive line. If you're going to win an AFC North game in the snow in these kind of conditions, who's going to win the line of scrimmage always is going to decide the outcome. That drive looked like the Browns' offensive line that we were kind of expecting to see all year long. That kick through the end zone. Steelers start from the 30. Kaylee Hart. Is that great? It works great. From the 30-yard line, they start this drive. A little toss back here. The Harris picking up a couple. How about what he said initially? His wife said, wait, what's the fuss about the football stuff? Like, why do people care so much early? Of course, now she obviously gets it, but it's probably nice for him to be able to unplug. Oh, for sure. You know, and be able to just get home and not have to worry about all that stress. It's been married for 28 years. It's working out. No doubt. Second and eight. But Russell Wilson continues to be very accurate. Receivers are running good routes. Ten and ten so far in this game. We're 128. Yet to throw in completion. Here. Under pressure. Loses the ball. Stripped. And the Browns are there to get it. Miles Garrett came in. He extracted it. And Winston Reed comes up with it. So earlier, Wilson was able to recover Harris' fumble. This time, he fumbles. And there goes your Defensive Player of the Year. Tell him that they're 2-8 in this game. It doesn't matter. That's passion. And that's energy. That's the matchup we keep talking about. Are you going to help out? Tied in there initially, a little push to try to help out Darnell Washington, but that's not enough against Miles Garrett. Dan Moore, you know, he knows about the speed. He knows about that power that he has. Again, that combination, 275 pounds. Illegal formation. Offense number 83 was covering number 80. That penalty has declined. It's third down. It was Hayward covering Washington. Decline, so it's third down and 10 now. It's an area that Pittsburgh is really trying to come up with answers, plus territory, not just red zone. They move the ball pretty consistently with Russell Wilson in there, quarterback. But the closer they get down into that red zone area, the more challenges they have. at being able to finish off drives. That's why Roswell's had to kick so many field goals. 29, in fact. Most in the lead. Third down and 10. Wilson. Pressure. Got it away. And trying to work his way for extra yardage, but not close to a first down is Warren, who takes it to the 24. Now Boswell who missed earlier from 58. Only his second miss of the season. Twice this season, Boswell, the wind is whipping. It's going, if anything, it's going into the wind right now. Six field goals last week. They didn't score a touchdown, won the game. Six field goals against Atlanta earlier in the season. No touchdowns, won the game. just to put the first points of the game on the scoreboard. And a flag is thrown. And that one from 43 would have been good. Movement on that left side of the line. They're going to push him back five more yards. Four snap. Full start. Offense. Number 97. Five-yard penalty. Still fourth down. Not been a clean game. You know, when you're Pittsburgh and your margin of error is so small because you're winning with defense and special teams, and that was a veteran, Cameron Hayward. But when you're winning like that, you're on the road on a short week. You've got to play clean, you know, and they've not done that in this first half. Ain't that easy playing clean tonight. That wind beginning to whip. Snow coming. It's now snow. It's 31 degrees. 48-yard field goal for Boswell. And that kick is good inside the right upright. his 30th of the season he leads the league in points it's 3-0 Pittsburgh only how can the gold bend on the stone only how can the gold see 0-1 defensive player of the year for T.J. Watt last year, Miles Garrett Watt 104 sacks Garrett 95.5 just tremendous to watch them and they do it in such different ways That will be a touchback as the ball was taken outside the one and then Ford had to pick it up in the end zone and downs it there so out to the 30 it will come he comes wide out onto the field And you know I mean imagine having an older brother as good as JJ Watt and you try to not only deal with him in the NFL but even in college going to the same school he's, again, very different style of a pass rusher. You can't imitate him or live up to what he did. He had to kind of carve his own lane, and he's done that, obviously, throughout not only his college career, but now brilliant NFL career. So Jerome Ford is the running back now. Paul comes out to the 20-yard line since he was outside the goal line. Downed it in the end zone, so Ford is the running back here now. Pass is caught here. And on the move for a gain of 15 yards is Jerry Judy. Had a big catch, and sooner or later you knew they were going to pick up a first down, and they did. Going back to the kick return. Looks like it was touched. Terry, you want to hop in here outside of the end zone, right? Sure, Kirk. It was touched in the landing zone. And then the kick brought it in the end zone down there. So it's a touchback, but it comes to the 20 because it first touched in the landing zone, not the end zone. So they start from the 20, take it out to the 36. Their first first down. The pass is caught on the near side and spun around. And taken down there for a gain of eight is Jerry Judy. tackle there by Joey Porter. So even though this is a team that wanted to come out and try to establish the run, everybody we talked to this week, every single person, Kevin himself, all the way down. It's a snap. Chubb. Stopped at the one. Third down. Isaiah Loudermilk makes that tackle. I think you just keep pounding the rock. You got confidence. This offensive line has held their own tonight. I think they got confidence they can win up front. You got Chubb who's done a good job of being able to move the pile. Got a Steeler down. Yeah, on his one knee there is Landon Roberts. So the injury stoppage. Of course the Steelers are minus Alex Highsmith already. Now you've got Roberts down. That was a big collusion there with Reed, the linebacker, 59, and Roberts. That's what took him out of the game. They run the ball here with Chubb. They come up half a yard short. They're going for it, right? They're going for this touchdown. You have to. Because, you know, worst case, you don't make it. You pin an offense back in these conditions back inside a one-yard line. So they've got two plays here to run Chubb and see if they can get it in. Yeah, you make him go 99 yards and you don't have Tony Dorsett to do it. Third and goal. Or the Metro. Right. Cleveland is 0-4-6 on third down tonight. Here they are, third down and goal. Fake. Throw. Oh, juggled. He had it and couldn't hold on. Six points go wasting there, and Joku can't bring it in. Fourth and goal. Wow, what a call again by Torsey. I think we all expected they're going to just run this with Chubb. They play action to Chubb. The Joku gets behind him. Just the ball, just not able to secure the ball. It gave Queen a chance to get back there and knock it away. How ironic. The number two and three tight ends make the big plays on this drive, and your top tight end, one of the best in the league, drops it. Yeah, right away. Points to himself. Kind of owns it. Here we go. Jerome Ford is now in the backfield. Out of the gun on fourth down and goal. Ford in motion. Winston. Under pressure. Going to run it. Into the end zone. Whoa. Jameis Winston looked like he was going to get sacked. Takes off. They go 65 yards and 10 plays. I mean, Jameis Winston is living a dream right now. No doubt. This guy, he saw his smile when he was talking to Kaylee in the pregame, saying how blessed he feels to have a chance to play tonight, and how fitting here, a fourth down play. Steelers caught in man-to-man coverage. I thought he's about to give up on a play. Looks behind him. He didn't really know where to go. Escapes. And with that man coverage, nobody had him, and he gets that touchdown. Goal for two. His first rushing TD in three years. Brings Judy inside. Throws, and this time it's El Lonto by Njoko for the two-point conversion. I'll tell you what's crazy. We're here a year ago. Joe Flacco comes out of nowhere. They're chanting Flacco, Flacco, Flacco. Tonight they'll be chanting Jameis, Jameis, Jameis. 18-6. Here's the touchdown. Look at his helmet. Bang. You can see the communication aspect of his helmet popping out of his helmet. He's trying to fix it, saying, guys, I can't hear you. I can't communicate. They still call the two-point play. It's dangling in front of his eyes, right? And his vision. He still makes a perfect throw to the tight end of Joku. And they get the two-pointer to, by the way, go up by 12. So they're trying to fix that helmet. You ever seen that? No, can't make it up. I mean, this is crazy. Nothing's going to stop number five tonight. You wonder, why wouldn't you go up by 12? Well, if you get a touchdown and a two-pointer and a field goal, they still have that 12-point lead. Have to get two touchdowns. drop from the five for Darryl Patterson to the 32-yard line. To Kaylee again. So guys, it turns out what you saw pop out of James' helmet was the battery to the communication device. But it stayed attached. So I am told... This year's 19. Yeah. It's a different year. A ton of injuries. You know, the trade of Z'Darrius Smith over to Detroit. Mike Hall had some issues early in the year. He's been injured now. Another guy that they thought could be really good, Alex Wright, was out after a torn tricep week four. So they lost their three of their four best pass rushers other than Miles Garrett. You see where that thrilling noise is coming from. Really appreciate that. Third and seven. Wilson, little lollipop. and trying to keep his balance is Warren Thornhill. Got him, and he's single a first down. Wow. Or, or, or. Or just maybe short by about a half a yard. Yeah. How about an effort there by Thornhill? He was way back in the middle of his field. He makes that play, and then you get another great play here by Warren. Somehow he gets hit, and he gets another four and a half, five yards. Comes close to getting the first. He got four down and one. And they go for it. And they stop him. Maurice Hurst takes him down. Warren stopped. Cleveland gets the ball back. Early toasty up here. Snow globe in Cleveland tonight right now. Snow coming down. Temperature is 30 degrees. looking for the turn it over Cleveland starts in the 45 yard line looking for room picking up three, Jerome Ford second down let's go back and look at the play that Maurice Hurst makes right here, you can see around him the Cleveland defense somewhat confused making sure everybody's trying to get lined up at that second level, but watch 90 he just wins, he really going back to his days of playing at Michigan he's a bit undersized for the interior but wins with sudden, just that quick movement, especially that initial burst off the ball, that time uses his hands and comes up with a pivotal play here to see if Jameis Winston and this offense can capitalize. Chubb back in the game. Chubb takes it, gets wrestled down just inside the 40-yard line by Cam Hayward. A pretty quiet night, but a very noisy career. 14th year in the league. Pick him number one in the first round out of Ohio State. Son of Ironhead Hayward. That's right. It just looks like this year with his five sacks. Six tackles for a loss. He's knocked down five passes this year. He looks like he's maybe in his late 20s this year the way he's playing. Fountain to youth. 35 years old. Third down and four. 0 for 4 tonight on third down. Can they convert? No, they can't. Tipped at the line of scrimmage. so that time it was we just talked about Hayward and usually he's able to get in there and affect the quarterback by pressuring this time ball is out in a hurry against that blitz and he's able to bat the ball down so they come up with a turnover and this time they are able to get a three and out but his defense Pittsburgh defense steps up again just after I say he's having a quiet night naturally there you go reverse the box. It does. The Horkes' kick will bound into the end zone. To the 20-yard line they'll come. Down by 7. 10-3 Cleveland. It's coming down more than it has all night right now. Looks great from up here. Fantastic. Beautiful. We're loving it. From the 20-yard line they start this drive here. Warren to the outside. Nice move. It's forced Pushed out a bounce. Uh-oh. Banks after a gain of nine. Pushed out there by Ronnie Hickman. Second down. The dog's bound. I don't know, man. You've got to be out of here. Well, I think you're out of here, Mike. If you're looking for a... Or you're tailgating a lot, all day. A nonstop to the Cleveland Clinic after this. Pick up a first down. Gain of three to the 33 first down. We're sitting here with a Cleveland lead of 10-3 because, you know, from the very beginning of this game, Pittsburgh has missed some opportunities. A couple times in plus territory, they tried a 58-yard field goal early, gave the Browns a pretty good field position. Here, plus territory, fourth and two, stopped. Here, fourth and inches in their own territory, stopped again. So their defense has bailed them out. But their own offense, you can see the results here. They've got to start putting a drive together and putting points on the board if they're going to come back and win this game. This is their eighth drive. And yet the punt, but nothing doing here on a pass that's incomplete. But sometimes it's not about the sack. It's that length and just getting his hands on the ball to knock it away from Russell. Short field now from the 31. So after that long drive, that defense has to come back. That pass reaching up for it. Moore. Elijah Moore makes the grab. And the Browns at the moment looking like anything but a 2-18. No doubt about it. This week when we got ready for this game, I went back and I looked at Jameis Winston and, of course, followed his career so closely in college at Florida State and what he did early in his career at Tampa. And it kind of went away after 2019. He went down in New Orleans, sat down and sat behind Drew Brees and was there with Sean Payton and didn't start for a number of years until he's getting this opportunity here in Cleveland right now. Keeping it. Gang tackle, but he picked up the first down with forward progress. I thought he had an interesting perspective about those years that he was down in New Orleans with Drew and Sean, and he said, especially in 2020 when he lost his starting job, he threw 30 picks the year before in Tampa. They get rid of him. They bring Brady in. He hits rock bottom in New Orleans, and he said, you know what? You know how his eyes kind of glistened, and he said, I actually look forward to it. I got to learn from Drew Brees and Sean Payton, see him come in every morning at 6.30 and study his mechanics, and I really took a lot away from that. We'll keep that gang from their appointed rounds. Carissa told me we're invited on to the Cuyahoga River dinner cruise tonight after the game. I actually get to participate in that. There you go. We'll be on it. Next show we cruise down to Cuyahoga. Check the name. All right, let's see if the Browns are going to be able to punch this in or have to settle for a field goal. They're not going to be in a hurry, that's for sure. Pittsburgh two timeouts remaining. And you've got a false start here. False start. Offense, number 65. Fetty, the left tackle there. Guy has played the majority of his career right tackle, But because of all the injuries they've had at the left tackle, DeJuan Jones, the latest, he's bumping over from right tackle over the left tackle. And a lot of times he's out there on an island tonight against two really good pass rushers. Second and 13. Winston dancing, throwing, taken at the 17-yard line, Elijah Moore. Jameis Winston does a really good job here of not throwing this ball because Queen takes away this underneath route. Look at his eyes. He wants to go to this crosser, and instead he comes off of it. There's a time Jameis Winston is just going to make his mind up and throw that football. Instead, he works from the left, doesn't predetermine. See, he's looking, he's looking. He sees six flash, so he comes off of it, comes back, locates that check down, and that's all he's coached to do in this system. Don't force it. Just check it down. Live for that next play. Time out that time taken by Pittsburgh, their second. And Cleveland's going to get the ball to start the second half. So Tomlin wants to conserve enough time. Yeah. Stop him here and they'll have plenty of time. So third and seven. Mike's been here before. He has seen it all. I always ask you, does he have a glossary of those sayings? Unbelievable. Does he think it just comes? It comes naturally. comes out. Love it. Meetings with him are the best. Third and seven. On the ground. Nothing. Stuffed. So they'll settle for a field goal attempt. That's Patrick Queen taking the measure of Nick Shubb. Interesting call with the timeouts and with the time. And right now, so far, they've not called the timeout. Pittsburgh, you would thought they would have. Well, it's interesting. You saw Stefanski say stay out there, stay out there. Clock down to a minute. It's kind of work clock here, I would think, right? Well, yeah, you would think, but who knows? You're trying to at least draw him offside. Even if you draw him offside, though, it's fourth and one. You still don't get the first down. It's all about the clock. Correct. Let's get a call timeout. Denzel Ward Knocks it down. Jordan Hicks, a late rush that time. Put the heat on. He rushed three initially. Hicks came late. Put the heat on. Now he got Pickens upset about something. To pull him away. Jameis Winston. 10th year in the league. Where did Jameis Winston go? There he is. He went to Cleveland. That's the backup. He was actually the number three quarterback at one point. Well, this defense got the pressure most of the night. Did what they had to do this time. It's called the moon ball, the infamous moon ball up in the air. Yeah, you got four Steelers down there. None of the receivers really in position to have any chance at all. Good job by the Browns knocking that straight down. Four receivers, six defenders. but he launches one, and there was that late move, legal, by Jordan Hicks. Jim Schwartz, Miles Care, what a night for both of those two. Well, like you say, you have a team 2-8, meeting a team 8-2. The line on the game was relatively close, all things considered. And the Browns do put on a show tonight. The Browns have now beaten the Steelers five of the last six when they've come here to Cleveland. Talk about division rivalries and all that goes with it. A lot of times it's a bunch of hooey, but not in this case. Pittsburgh and Cleveland. What a show. 24-19. Browns win it. Post-game show. It's been by the Browns staff that he maintained his ability to communicate that entire time. But, yes, they did pop right back in, and the helmet's good to go. Unbelievable. How about, what a story with Jameis. Oh, yeah. We've seen other quarterbacks kind of wash out. Oh, they're done. They're just backups, and they resurface and resurrect their careers. Geno Smith out at Seattle. Baker's done that. Flacco's done that. Seen Sam Darnold do it in Minnesota. To the outside goes the throw here. Four-yard game. Darnell Washington, second and six. Yeah, it's time for the reliability report presented by Xfinity Internet. and who better than Miles Garrett, what he's been able to do. You talk about reliability. I think he came into this game feeling threatened and challenged. He didn't really care, hey, we're 2-8. We talked with him this week, and he seemed locked in, whether they were 8-2 or 2-8. I think any time he goes up against the Steelers, against T.J. Watt, he wants to take it to another level, and he has certainly done that for the Browns defense. Here's Fields now in the game. Saw him earlier. So they go to Justin Fields. He will keep it. And the ex-bear. Down the sideline he goes before he's thrust out of bounds. Off a block from Connor Hayward. So they bring him in for a special play from a special package, and he gets 30. Remember, Taysom Hill gave this defense an issue last week with these zone read looks. Good blocks downfield by Hayward, a two for one. Stays in bounds and picks up some huge yards. I talked to Jim Schwartz about that this week, and he talked about, you know, we prepped even in a short week. We know Fields is going to come in there. We've got to be ready for those zone read looks, and we've got to be able to defend and set that edge. That time he got around with that big block and it got yards. So Ward and Delpit run into each other. Fields stays in here. This time he tries the other side and goes into the bench. Devin Bush takes serve there. Wilson looks back. Who's coming into the game? Wilson or is Fields coming back in? Fields going to stay in the game, looks like but I think anybody who's ever watched him play, whether in college at Ohio State or even with the Bears, obviously he can throw the football. Right now he's that change of pace guy to Russell Wilson running the more traditional style of offense but don't be surprised at all to see him at any point pull this ball back and throw it and try to find a receiver to try to make a play. Defense changes their scheme because of his threat to run the football. Second down 12. Snap a little high, handles it, under pressure, throws up, a 50-50 ball, it doesn't matter. And they hit him late. Yep, you got Jordan Hicks coming in, and a flag, personal foul. I think it was one of those that Terry might be able to help us. It wasn't so much late, it was he landed on him with all his weight on the follow-through, once he hit him after the throw. it's one that you know over the last couple years i think fans sometimes terry get confused on but it's watch him drive him into the ground terry i think that's what they call absolutely kirk he has to brace he has to get to the side he buries the correct punishes him with his shoulder clearly a bodyweight foul for roughing the passer now russle wilson is back in It's up to stop when you're coming in on skates. Ten minutes to play in regulation. From the 22. Harris. Yarder two. Shelby Harris makes the stop. Under ten minutes to play. 18-6 Cleveland. Not to sound like a broken record, but again, the red zone area, the plus territory for these guys has been an ongoing problem. I thought Russell Wilson, he's been playing well, but didn't you feel that when Fields was in there, he gave them a little spark? He gave them a little bit of something, the threat of running, and then also throwing the football. Well, they've got seven quarters without a touchdown. Now you've got a little jump from Okawanko. neutral defense number 54 five yard penalty second down coming across the line turning a second and eight into a second and three now kind of a no brainer who can help Russell Wilson out in the pass game Who can win one-on-one down here? Pickens down isolated one-on-one against Emerson. Maybe Friar Muth. Emerson throws. Here's Harris helping him out. And Harris dives forward for a first down. Declined the penalty. Let's see if he, after talking to Rick Conley. The pass is declined. Fourth down. All right, fourth down. So fourth and two. they're basically saying all right you want to try a 43 yard field goal you want to go for they're gonna go for it meanwhile Hopkins you got a chance to win the game right well I guess it just tells you about the condition well you still have 155 and in the Pittsburgh is two times a lot going on here now they going to move it back. It's originally declined, but it's a five-yard penalty. Hang with us, gang. We're all in this together. They declined it, and then after talking to him, they push him back. To the 30. So there's your five-yard penalty. It's still third down, and third down and seven. That makes sense. Ready for play. Not ready for play. Time out, Pittsburgh. The wheels, they are spinning. Let's keep Jackson, I'd say. Terry, there was a little confusion out on the field. What was the end result? Yeah, originally they declined the penalty, and then they went through all of the options. It's not a loss of down. They decide to accept the five-yard penalty and repeat the down. Okay. So Hopkins still on the sideline. Ball to 30. Snow has barely abated. Third and seven. In the pocket. Has a man to the 13-yard line. Jerry Judy having some night. Six catches, 87 yards for him. What a job here is staircase in against man coverage. Looks like we have a flag that comes in late. Joey Porter passes it off to Minka Fitzpatrick and looked like a little bit of indecisive miscommunication there by the defense. But a great ball there by Jameis to give Judy a chance. Penalty on the defense. Oh, man. Bishop. Hits Judy. So it's a first and goal from the 43. We might go back and look at that play in a second. Not sure they touched him down. If they did, it was with a leg. Yeah, barely. Here goes some breaking tackles. To the one-yard line he goes. Now, of course, Cleveland does not want to be in any hurry at all. Pittsburgh, because they used that timeout, but they had a late defensive substitution in just a few plays ago. They're down to just one timeout. And obviously if Cleveland gets into the end zone, Pittsburgh needs its own touchdown. Field goal would do no good. Second down and goal. 67, 66 seconds. Ticking down. Winston from the gun. Hands it off. to the end zone goes Chubb touchdown Browns look at this crowd nobody's left the Browns are obviously going to go for two here and probably because I lived in Ohio most of my life and I've felt the pain of the Browns fans. My first thought as soon as he scored is he scored too fast. 57 seconds even if they go for two here. You're going to give Russell Wilson with a timeout plenty of time to work back. They'll have one timeout. They'll have whatever's left of the clock. After the kick they go for two to try to make it a seven point game. Well, you got Chubb lined up in the backfield as the tailback. Well, sorry. Whatever you'd want to call it. Yeah. Meanwhile, then Winston is on that same tour right now in a way. Not that, you know, people forgot about him. We would say, defense number 24. Five-yard penalty. Automatic. Well, there's an automatic first down here. You know, for Winston, I mean, what's his future? Well, right now he's standing over there on the sideline. Yeah. Yeah, Dorian Thompson, he comes back in the game, which is a surprise. And he's kind of their version of Justin Fields as far as a changeup and what he can do. Nothing like putting a guy in, ice cave on the bench. Literally ice cold. Let's see what you got. What he got is a handoff here to Chubb. Picks up about three. So Dorian Thompson, Robinson. And when Watson tore his Achilles, Thompson Robinson finished that game. And then Winston started the next game. So he comes in for one play and out he goes. He is a threat to be able to get, you know, he can throw it also. But also he has that ability to kind of pull the ball and get around the edge the way fields can. Remember, Winston's been throwing the football. He's been doing a really good job of making quicker decisions. Steelers taking away. Look at their coverage. A little bit tighter. No play. Left tackle looked like he moved. Remember, he just gave up a sack, and now this time he moves. Offense number 65. Five-round penalty. Second down. He's Betty again taking the place of the injured DeJuan Jones. Kaylee. Guys, Miles Garrett is in the blue medical tent on the Brown sideline right now. He went in with an athletic trainer for a minute, and it wasn't long before the independent concussion specialist joined him in there. That specialist just left, and it looks like they're headed to the monitor. He's already had a huge night. Three sacks in the first half. Watchman held in check tonight. Ford is the running back. Pressured. On the run. On the move. Throws. Leaping grab at the 40-yard line. Jerry Judy. extends the play, Judy gets free, and meanwhile, he got hit. Yeah, he got hit after he threw it. How did he get this ball over top of this coverage? We can barely see him. How does he locate Judy and make this throw up and over that defender? Sonar. That was incredible. On the run, over Elliott, and in the hands of Judy on that third down play. And then takes a hit on, well, not too much of a hit there by Queen. Slowing getting up. Trying to sell it. Looking for 15 wins. From the 39, off the fake. Rolling the other way. Throws into traffic, and that's incomplete. That's how I'm trying to get it to Elijah Moore. And Joko is also in the area. Second and 10. Just when you think Jameis Winston and the Browns, same old Browns. Steelers are going to find a way to win and the Browns are going to find a way to lose Jameis Winston says not so fast my friend when that completion gets into plus territory I think He's in plus territory, right? Nice over to Lee Corso. Not so fast. Second and ten. The Hutt! 180! The Hutt! Rose broke it up that time Manjoko covered on the play knocked away by Beanie Bishop third and ten he got away with one there I don't know if he couldn't see Bishop or the one thing with Jameis Winston he gets on a roll he's a gunslinger he's going to take some chances very very close to the rookie here of being able to step in front of that football and intercepting that But Cleveland is 0 for 7 on third down. But if you get him to fourth down, they're 3 for 3 on fourth. Third and 10. Good protection. Throws intercepted in the 21-yard line. They pick him off. Dante Jackson. 422. Seelers with the lead and get the ball. As a football player, get this football in to Elijah Moore. And again, he's got tough conditions. But right before he throws this, look where the receiver is and look where this football ends up going to the outside, right to the defender. So you break into the inside with the receiver. The ball is thrown more to the outside where Donche Jackson has outside leverage. You can even see the way the football came out of his hand. I don't know if it slipped out of his hand, but it did not look like the throws that he's made tonight where it's been decisive and the ball's come out and it's been on a line. That one kind of floppy and bounced to the outside on him. So strategy comes into play right now with your timeout usage. They have all three to the 27-yard line. He goes here second down seven. That's still a long way to go. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. We talked about his vertical passing game, what he's known for those moonshots. We haven't seen a lot of moonshots, but 4-6, 135 on passes thrown 20 yards or further. That's a big difference in his game right now. So good job of dealing with the conditions. Fields now into the game with the ability to run it. They just want to stay in bounds and try to pick up first downs. And Garrett out of the 10, and he's in the game. Second and 7. Harris. Big third down here because if they pick up a first down, you've got to start thinking of using your timeouts. They may even use one here with 332. It's going to be third down and four, and Cleveland won't take a timeout right here. I think it's important for us to talk real quick about Justin Fields and the wrinkle that he brings. I was talking to Arthur Smith about this. It's not just he's a runner and he's in the game. Do you know how much practice time it puts on Kevin Stefanski and any team that gets ready to play the Steelers? Because it's zone read, you can't just say, oh, when two comes in, he's a run threat. You've got to spend so much time, and he may not even ever get in the game. So it takes away from your time that you can spend on Russell Wilson and the normal offense that they're attacking you with because of the threat of the zone read game, the power read game. QB run game, and it's just a nice little wrinkle, not just tonight, but the rest of the way for Arthur Smith and his Steelers offense all year long. They've got two quarterbacks. They've got one and 1A. Third and four. Field stays in. Go empty here for the moment. Now, Harris next to him. fields is going to throw and throw long and it's incomplete intended for pickens and pickens going wild wanted the flag emerson covering them on the play and this is exactly what cleveland was praying for yeah they stop them and they stop the clock exactly right yeah and this is part of what you get coverage wise when you have the athletic quarterback in there it's just one-on-one i think the reason you you want an interference is again emerson's Just kind of running aimlessly there. Not really fine in the football. But he didn't really affect him at all in his rally. Meanwhile, the kick here is a short one. Cornish Waitman. You can't even tell. Did somebody get a hand on it? No, I think he just shanked it. He did not hit that good at all. Just came off the side of his foot. Well, we saw a 12-yard punt before from Pajorkas. And this one on what was a fourth and four. will be spotted in Pittsburgh territory, we think. Yeah, that just came off the inside of his foot. Nobody got a hand on it. Just missed it. Think about this. This Steelers team wins games like this, again, with special teams being a big part of the equation. And here with the game on the line, you need a big punt. You shank one, and now Jameis Winston, a chance to bounce back from that interception. into Jackson. That was a 15-yard punt. So at the 45, Cleveland now. Through the middle. Gain a 7. Ford. You were saying at the break, Dustin Hopkins, after the week he had last week, really the year he has had, could this game potentially come down to his leg in these conditions? He's a great kicker. He just had a tough time, especially last week. We're going to find out pretty quickly. It's Under three minutes to go. There's Hopkins getting loose on the sideline. Second and four. Cleveland two timeouts. And the two-minute warning. Winston in trouble. Winston hangs in there. Winston throws. Dropped. Had his man. Had Aikens. Couldn't hold on. Third and four. Steelers here making a blunder. Queen in L3. Has to throw a jump pass. Warren. And now they have to take their timeout with 16 seconds. He gets the first down. Pittsburgh. They're third and final. It will be 30 seconds. 30-second timeout. Schwartz's defense. Can they hold? He got 16 seconds. And obviously Pickens is your main vertical threat downfield. We saw Calvin Austin make a play as well. Mike Williams, who's not 100% a few weeks ago against the Commanders, made a catch late. He's coming off of the field right now. But the big thing is I don't know if I go into Hail Mary mode right now. I still think there's a, with a veteran quarterback like this, maybe get a crosser, something where you can pick up 10 to 20 yards near the boundary to get out of bounds or get up to the ball and spike it into the ground. Real quick, with 16, you can do either. So the ball is at the 44 of the Browns. Puts fire moves on the slot. You've got three receivers to the right side. Wilson dancing. throws that one away. Now you've got 10 seconds. Now you're really compelled to either get the guy out of bounds or do your Hail Mary act right here. How about rushing four and being able to get that kind of pressure on a quarterback in this moment in the game? I mean, you would think rushing four that he's going to be back there with all kinds of time, especially in these conditions. But Miles Garrett leading the charge there with a spin move, got into him. 10 seconds, whistles. Yeah, Browns timeout. Yep, timeout. Cleveland. Timeout. Cleveland, their second. It will be 30 seconds. What was that year? 2012, the Monday night football, the Russ fail-marry against the Packers. He's got it in. Yeah, Russ has been involved in some fantastic finishes, both pro and con, as you know. What a great career. What's he got in the score tonight, next week? Friday, Raiders Chiefs on Black Friday. Day game three Eastern, noon Pacific. Jim Schwartz electing to get his safeties obviously way back. He's going to continue to rush the floor. Thornhill is back deep. Rodney McLeod is back deep. Yeah, they're standing at the 15-yard line. Four-man rush again. Wilson has to go to the outside, and that is caught. So Austin makes that catch. Now you have six seconds. That took four seconds. So if Cleveland plays the same type of defense, You could theoretically try to run something similar to that. You know, try to get maybe another 8 to 10 yards. Be tight. They did it in four seconds. Yeah, they could. Third and one. Six seconds. Cleveland going to call another timeout. Yep, now you've got three down linemen. Cleveland, their third and final. Yeah, they moved Jordan Hicks. into a spot around eight yards downfield. The safety is very deep. So the Cleveland Browns trying to become giant killers. Beat Baltimore. How much do you think the Ravens want to see this game in this way tonight, huh? Oh, yeah. John Harbour and company, I'm sure. Just another reminder, the NFL, I mean, every week, It seems like almost every game, one possession, you never know what the heck's going to happen. These teams are all so close. It's just a matter of who can play consistently. That's what separates these teams. Everybody knows nothing. Third and one. Rush three, drop eight. Now a late rush. Throw enough for grabs in the end zone. How does this one end? Incomplete. Right down to the nub. Hitting the football. He learned that from T.J. Watt. Knocked that ball loose on the ground. White jerseys on it. Steelers got the break that they needed. Covered by Deshaun Elliott. Snowy. They just dump it. Dump it's the guy who forced the fumble from Derrick Henry last week. Herbig was the man. So Winston looking at the tablet. Herbig on the sideline. Russell Wilson takes over. The ball at the 27-yard line. Play action. Going for it. Oh! Oh, and somehow behind Dickens, Rodden McLogne was back there on the play. Look for a moment as if Pickens would secure it a little behind, second down and ten. Pickens' angle is working more across the field. And the ball is thrown more up the field. And then he just doesn't locate it. I don't know if it's because of the snow or what. See how he's looking behind him. I think Russell Wilson is expecting him to work a little bit more vertical as opposed to across the field. He's not quite on the same page, but he had him beat. It was there. Second and ten. Draw. Harris fighting through a couple of extra yards, making it third down, called it seven. Under seven to play. Jim Schwartz has dialed up a lot of pressure. They've been winning up front. Miles Garrett has been such a big factor tonight. Third down. He's lined up to the blind side and the left to Russell Wilson. He does not want to hold on to this football. The ball needs to come out quickly here. Third and six. Garrett just got circled. They double-teamed him. Wilson to the end zone again. Can he hold it in? Austin. Yes, he can. Touchdown. Calvin Austin 23 yards and the Steelers take the lead they had split safeties it's the perfect call Delpit's here, safety here you gotta work to the middle that's exactly what they're able to do nice throw right on the line over top of the linebackers could not have been thrown any better by Russell Wilson. Got position on Newsom. In he goes. They'll go for two to try to make it a three-point game. That's not an easy target. Usually you throw that route. It's to a big tight end or a lanky receiver. Austin in the slot. He's 5'9". So think about that target to make that throw. That's how perfect of a throw that was by Wilson. two big catches tonight for Austin one for 46 and pay dirt here from 23 and that's incomplete 10 for Patterson so it remains a one point game go back to a wild card game the last time the Steelers kept it trailing by 12 in the fourth quarter won the game against two Cleveland The Steelers looked like they were dead in the water or in the snow. And all of a sudden they have the lead again. But still have 6.15 to go. Yep. Cleveland has all of its timeouts. 29 degrees on the shores of Lake Erie. Russell Wilson vertical pass game. back on display tonight, even in these conditions for the Steelers. Drop picked up from the eight-yard line. Ford to the 33. Let's go back and look at Myles Garrett, who's had a big night, and this is on that touchdown pass. Look at Fryer-Muth, who's helping out Dan Moore. Dan Moore's been out there isolated from time to time. That time, Fryer-Muth was not going to let him. But that hit that Russell Wilson took after he released that football. There's the great ball to Austin. Couldn't have been placed any better. And then the two-pointer where he tried to get it to Patterson. Now you tell me. Yeah. What did Terry tell me? He did not. Was it catchable? On we go. Winston has that one knocked down. So funny because the game starts. We're talking about Russell Wilson, the 10 good years in Seattle, and the two fairly forgettable years. And he looks like he's on the reclamation or, you know, tour. Boy, how big is that two-point conversion that he had with the battery hanging out over his face? They end up hitting it, going up by 12. And just a call, you know, instead of, hey, let's just go up, let's be safe, let's kick the extra point. The decision to go for two there, to get it to 12, is big. Need two touchdowns. Otherwise, simply you get one field goal and a two-point conversion with a 2-0. That's right. First and goal. Warren. Flanking Wilson. Instead, they give it to Patterson. Coming around the corner. Nowhere. Read perfectly. Delft is right there. Devin Bush as well. Second down and goal. Boy, did Devin Bush feel this. the entire way. Instead of reading these guys that are pulling, he's right here, and he just does a good job of using his eyes and trusting it, and then being able to work through the blocker, the tight end there, Friar Moose. So good instincts, good feel and discipline staying home, and a good job of fighting through that block to finish the play. And now you bring Fields. Whoa. Unscorcementlike conduct, something coming up. Towards potential disqualification. After the play, Delpit must have said something, did something. That slot. It was he and George Pickens going at it, and then he smacks at him after the whistle coming right here. A little smack right there. That's when the flag came up, too. So it's a first and goal. It's a three-yard penalty, as it turns out. He grabbed the mouthpiece and threw it on the ground. From the three. Warren to the end zone. touchdown Pittsburgh not the cleanest handoff but it works and what an answer what an answer here for Arthur Smith and Mike Tomlin they go with Justin Fields instead of as a change-up they go with him to try to provide a spark and they get the drive that they needed to finally put a touchdown up on the board and we got a long way still to go here with 7.57 to go 69 yards, 7 plays, 5 of them on the ground. Boswell to try to make it a 5 point game. Had to handle that snap and got it down. Nice move there by Waitman to get it down for the extra point. 18-13. I got to tell you, you look at this crowd Almost everybody is still here The kickoff will be fielded at the one-yard line Jerome Ford To the 24 More on Jameis Yeah, what a night it's been Not just the numbers I think more about just what he represents The way he's been in command of this offense He and Ken Dorsey have been in sync They've had a good plan You're going up against a great defense They've been aggressive That was Blake Whitehart who made a great play. And the Joku's getting involved. This is a play of the game. Fourth down. He's got to make a play against man coverage. He ends up getting that touchdown. They go for two. Finds the Joku to go up at that point. By 12. But the Steelers are not going away. What a drive and what an answer. We're going to have a lot of fun here in this last 748. Oh, yeah. Plenty of time. Winston from the 24. What, Eddie? What's up? Chubb. No game. You know, I started to have the fans. You know, every town. Oh, we got the greatest fans. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? But look at this. It's near blizzard. It's mainly Cleveland fans. I know Pittsburgh sometimes overtakes stadiums. Not tonight. Not tonight. This is like 90%. Not at all. Look at this. And they're 2-8. They're staying. On a Thursday night. 2-8 Thursday night. Terrible weather. You've got to hand it to them. No, you got to hand it to them. And they have, the team has responded, at least up to this point. Second out of nine. They give him a show tonight for sure. Look out. Ball's out. Steelers have it. Nick Herbeck, who made a couple of very big plays last week, coming back from an injury, does it again. well finally that was the concern tonight the right tackle who's had to move over with DeJuan Jones down had to move over the left tackle he's had a relatively quiet night but here with a tight end there Herbig is lined up outside and uses his quickness there with a slow movement there by 65 Zane will get around him and good job of low kick offense number 59 Hard five yard penalty so hard to do a hard count down in there. That's Winston Reed is a defensive player They put him in as the fullback And he flinches Now You're in the same situation basically even though you're moving it back Yeah change the personnel groupings right get a little bit more spread look still need two to make it seven Chubb comes out Judy's had a big, big night He's wide right Now he goes into motion He gets stacked on the left side Winston throwing for Judy Broken up Elliott in the end zone What a crazy game. I'm just telling you. Russell Wilson's got 57 seconds at a timeout. This ball's going, you know this ball's going across midfield and we're all going to be holding on for dear life here to see how this thing's going to end. What a job that Winston and Judy have done for this offense. Judy had such a great route. I think Porter there at the end, did he touch him with his left leg? Looks like he maybe did. The ball, he just drops the ball. Not sure I want this thing. This one's too much fun. I know. Man, it's so good to see 24 in a Browns uniform running hard after everything he's been through. The rehab that he worked so hard for 14 months to get back in. And scores two touchdowns tonight. There's the two-pointer. Unable to come up with that, but they still have the five-point lead. Chubb's averaging less than three yards a carry. But still those two big TDs. Three sacks for Garrett in the first half. So what magic remains? Wilson's had a great night, 18-22 for 240. We talked about last year we were here, and Joe Flacco came out of retirement to lead them to the playoffs with a win over the Jets on a Thursday night. And this year, it's Jameis Winston, again with Watson getting hurt. He'll be one of the big heroes tonight if they hold on. This is when the PA announcer will say, thank you for coming and drive carefully on your way home tonight, and he'll mean it. Hopkins. It's returnable from the 10. Jalen Warren. And he will work his way back out to about the 35. Meanwhile, we can tell you right after the game, the JCPenney post-game show with Carissa and the gang exclusively on Prime Video. Kaylee with the star of the game. A lot of stuff to talk about tonight. A lot of stuff. Well, what's great here in this last 50 seconds is you've got a quarterback like Russell Wilson. He knows where he wants to find the matchups. You've got Miles Garrett who's going to be in a sprinter's stance to try to get after him. He's already had a big night with a number of sacks. What can Pittsburgh do? They've got a back there, it looks like, to try to help Dan Moore out on that left side. Can he go 64 yards in 50 seconds? One timeout. Rush four. Pass caught up at the 38-yard line. Friar Muth works his way for what should be a first down or close to it. Russell Wilson, again, been in these situations a million times. He realizes the urgency he's got to go with here at 30 seconds and one timeout. Trying to get in the position where at least he can throw a Hail Mary if nothing else. On the move. Incomplete. Barring the intended receiver in the manner of speaking. Isaiah McGuire put the heat on. Now he's done a 22 second. Yeah, none of the receivers as he rolled to his left and went into scramble mode. Nobody worked with him. He was running that time, and it looked like Pickens was just kind of stopped once he saw Russell Wilson scrambling. So nobody helping him on that scramble. All he could do was throw it away. Still third and one, so Frymuth did not get the first down. Third and one, put one second more back on the clock. It's at 20. Both taking Njoku. Njoku works here. He got two defenders that go with him. So you got nobody on the other tight end. He's all alone. Nobody has it. I mean, look at the room to run if he catches that football. Nobody took Akins. Looked like he almost jumped a little early, too. Third down and four. All for eight are the Browns on third down. Tip. Incomplete. Deshaun Elliott. Fourth down. this is this is where you have the play Ken Dorsey's held on to it it's the play that you feel based on the coverage that you know you're going to get that Jameis Winston's going to get back out and get the ball if it's man coverage maybe rubs or crossers mesh routes underneath try to create a pick 3 for 3 on 4th down here they are again been a quiet night for this man because of the double teams and the chips. What? Bellow him again. Chipped him again. Passes a little low. And caught. Jerry Judy was right there. What a job. We just said use a pick. Use a rub. Anything you can do. That's what Judy uses with Najoku. Man coverage. And watch how he uses the big fella. Almost has just set a screen. Get away from him. Use the big man to be able to help you out. Get the first down. Go to your knees, make the catch, pass to the outside here. And that will be caught by Jordan Aikens. And that will make it second down. They're going to try to go without a huddle, but they stop right here. How about him just not only making the catch, but staying in bounds? I mean, every yard counts right now, right? I mean, just getting closer to this field goal for Hopkins. Inside five minutes, second half clock. Doesn't wind, so it stopped at 2.05 as he went on the bounce. Second down and two. Needing two. Getting none. Four. Two-minute warning. So many big... Nine range. Four-five. This year, it's beyond 50 where it's struggling. Nothing is for certain right now. That picture says it all. That picture says it all. The snap alone, right? Third down and two. 0 for 9 on third down. Can they convert here? Look out. Under pressure. Fires. And that is incomplete. That time is Patrick Queen had a free shot at him. So it's fourth down and two. Really good defense here. They're going to take a look at this. Did Winston just try to get rid of the football? and there wasn't any receivers anywhere around that. They were just offensive linemen. Can you imagine if this is intentional grounding and they move this back? Take them out of field goal range. Right now, you know, in this weather, you're on the cusp. You're a 43-yard field goal, which would be a 58-yard field goal if they call it intentional grounding. So, here we are. Make the call. Crowd, of course, is already making the call. Brad Allen will have the official word. Yeah, there's no receiver in the area. The ball didn't get past the line of scrimmage here. It's a little assist from upstairs. All right, Terry, you want to weigh in quickly? Yeah, he's certainly in the pocket. There's no receiver in the vicinity. The only issue would be it looks like he starts his motion. The single touching of a pass. Offense number 55. It's a five-yard penalty. Remains third down. So you're saying he got hit as he was starting to throw the football? Exactly, Kirk. That's why it's not intentional grounding. But apparently a lineman intentionally touched the football, touched the pass, which is a five-yard penalty. Poshik, Ethan Poshik. It would have been interesting to see where that ball would have gone if he wouldn't have been hit because I don't think it had a lot on. But anyway, they wave it off. Meanwhile, they're holding up. Allen's coming over. Brad Allen's coming over to the sideline. For the moment, they have it at the 25, and he said a five-yard penalty. He's talking to Tomlin. Explaining to Mike what the situation is here. So the original scrimmage was the 25. Going to be fourth down. where's the ball they announced it that Pittsburgh.
