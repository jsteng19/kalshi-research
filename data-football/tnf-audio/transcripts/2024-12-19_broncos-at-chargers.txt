 He learned a lot there. He continues to grow. I think the addition of Malcolm Roach, John Franklin Myers has really helped him with D.J. Jones. But you look at the year he's had. He's second in defensive tackles with pressures on pass rushing. But he's just as good against the run. Taking more snaps, 804 coming into the game than any other defensive lineman in the NFL. Herbert buying time. Firing, caught, wide open 25-yard line. Taking it to the 14. They go to Stone Smart. The tight end. Under five to go in the quarter. First out of the 15. This is a great job of improvising here by Herbert. Once he rolls out, I thought he might look to get the ball to his guy, to Ladd McConkie. But McConkie takes a couple defenders with him and opens up the middle of the field that he thought smartly to be able to let me get the ball to smart there. And it gets the first down. Good choice of words. Smart leader, smart. Look out, Herbert. Down he goes. Big sack. Tillman right there. Andre Tillman with a sack, and that's a 10-yard loss, second and 20. I think this is what Vance Joseph loves about this edge pressure. It's the depth that he has. That's the fourth sack this year by big number 92. You know, Benito and Cooper, Ellis get a lot of attention. But he's got four guys on the edge that can pressure the quarterback. They lead the league in sacks. 52 after that one. Herbert throws. Talk, spinning, look at the room. And you've got five white shirts taking care of McCocky at that spot at the 19-yard line. Third and 14. There's Vance Joseph, defensive coordinator we've talked about quite a bit tonight. One of the best in the league. Everybody talks about that game against Miami. since that Miami game. This defense has turned the corner and has played like a different outfit with confidence, especially this year. Herbert, stepping up, away from pressure. Here he goes again, slides to a stop at the 11, gets hit at the end of the play, and there's a flag. Justin Stern, that came in late. Yeah, it's late. That's going to give him a first down. Anytime a quarterback gives himself up, It's not so much about how physical or how aggressive the hit is. Sternadz is trying to come in. He's a special teams guy that's been forced to play linebacker with the injury to Alex Singleton in week three. He gives himself up and then right there. Are they going to discuss whether they want to pick the flag up or not? Personal foul. They don't. This is very reckless. Defense number 40. I think any time. This is a better look at right here. anytime you see a quarterback, again, give himself up like that. It's not that he's frustrated because he didn't feel like he hit him that hard. But he was down. Knee was down. You follow through like that. That's a penalty. Brian Matu, yeah. I mean, you're in no man's land at that point. That was going to be fourth down. Yep. Instead, first and goal. Edwards is in there. Edwards. Find space. Touchdown, Chargers. The 24-19, Harbaugh saying let's go for two to make it a three-point game. So a huge personal foul call sets him up. Instead of going for three, they're going to get seven. Here's the great block by Pipkins, all 42 fists leading the way. Really nice job of adjusting to the movement by the Broncos' defense. Both those guys had good blocking angles and a good feel and read there by Edwards to get it into the end zone. Edwards to the back. Johnson to the left, palmer to the right. McConkie in the slot to the right. Edwards in motion. Herbert's going to keep it. And does he get to the goal line? He does not. Nick Benito is right there Having a tremendous season And makes a big, big play You're right, Benito is the pass rusher This guy gets off of the block By one of these big fullbacks 42 fists and gets down And makes his play Does the ball break the plane? No, he's short What a play Stays a 5 point lead for the Broncos 24-19 Did the first game here with Chris Collinsworth Michelle Tafoya, no fans. COVID year. Oh, yeah. Rams and the Dallas Cowboys. What? $5 billion stadium. Meanwhile, if the season ended. He's in on the pocket. They had appreciation for Bo Nix's ability, so they want to squeeze the pocket. You see the blitz there by Derwin James. So they dial up the pressure. Good call by Minner, and nice to see Bosa get involved there. Of course, the minute we say he doesn't look like the old Bosa, he says, what the hell are you talking about, right? Hey, fellas. His fifth sack of the season. I'm still number 97 out here. Second and 18 in timeout taken here. Timeout. Denver, they're close. 30 seconds. 30-second timeout. Well, we talked about Khalil Mack and Bosa. For this team to not only be competitive tonight, but for this team to make a run, they need their alphas. They need their guys to be as effective and as dominant as they can be at crunch time. And you can see, I mean, it's Mack is a guy that, you know, in his 11th year still has the juice, still can make plays. Bosa, as I indicated, has been battling through some injuries. It's just great to see him out there fighting through it. That time, he's able to come up right after that boot to win around him. The very next play, they dial up the pressure, and Bosa wins that one-on-one matchup with McClinchy on the right side. Second and 18. Very important drive for the Chargers to stop him here. Half winding down. And the Broncos are going to get the ball to start the third quarter. Second and 18 after Denver took that last timeout. Extra pressure. James coming through. Catch is made up. Pass the 40-yard line. Taken down. Is Courtland Sutton stopped there? and for a game of 12 to make it third down and six. And bring James again. They're dialing up pressure now. It's 33 in the back here. Williams sees it. He actually misses. But Bo Nix has a good job of keeping his focus downfield. Found the matchup that he wanted, and he gets the ball to his guy Sutton for big yards there. They get into a hole after the sack, and the call there and the execution. Now they've got a real shot here on third down. Denver's converted all three third downs The Chargers D can't get off the field Play clock at one Extra man comes Pass is broken up Vele was the intended receiver And so finally the Chargers are able to stop him And get the ball back Yeah, they get him behind the sticks And Jesse Minter now, he is a defensive coordinator He's able to dictate things He walked seven guys up to the line of scrimmage They end up showing seven and then dropping two, but you don't know who's coming. It's enough to affect Bo Nix. Pretty tight coverage there. He's able to knock that ball away on a pretty well-thrown ball. Riley Dixon, his first punt of the night. Waiting for it at the nine. Darius Davis, and Davis wriggles his way up to the 25-yard line. 2.34 to halftime, and we're back in 30 seconds. Throughout. As the Chargers take over here at their own 25-yard line. 2.34. And the Chargers have all three timeouts, plus the two-minute run. Plenty of time. Hassan Haskins in the backfield. pass comes out into a flat here Darius Davis with speed, just ran that kickback picks up 12, tackled by Brandon Jones, first down you got Haskins out in front good call, nice job of getting those linemen, little slip string, good way to start this drive get another playoff before the two minute warning rush four pass caught, 40 yard line and then backing his way for another couple of his passports. Played in Michigan under Jim Horvath. Two-minute warning with the Denver Broncos up by 11. C.R.E. is a SoCal guy. Two minutes to halftime. second down and five play action pass is caught wide open Lukaki taken down inside the 40 at the 37 yard line Brandon Jones made that tackle gain of 21 couple things here you get Sternat on a blitz and what a job by Herbert looking over top of him throwing it and he loves that deep over route the team moving in either direction right now Unnecessary roughness. Defense number 23. Kelly will reinforce half the distance for the goal for Stout. So Tony Jefferson getting the start to the map. He's Elijah Molden is down. Again, this offensive line and these young backs look to bring Terry in. Terry, what do you see there? Kirk, it just looks like a normal shoulder-to-shoulder hit. There's some contact to the helmet. I don't see him lower his head and initiate or make forcible contact to the opponent. I really don't see a foul there. It's about a three-yard penalty as it turns out half the distance. Estame is the running back. They give it to him, and in he goes for a touchdown. In behind Ben Powers. So that drive consumed almost six minutes. and the Chargers, who were burned for over 500 yards last Sunday by Tampa Bay, start the same way tonight. That's exactly right. All they talked all week about was having a chance to get a Venge last week's game. Look at that job again by Miners, the right guard, really the right side of the offensive line. The entire offensive line did an amazing job for a team that's heard all year, what's wrong with your running game? They open it up on this opening drive. Ten plays, seven runs. They go 43 yards. It's a heck of a job. Lutz with the extra point. Estimating with his first NFL touchdown. Seven, nothing, Denver. Yeah. One of the grace of all time. Former partner of mine on Monday Night Football back in 2000, 2001. Watching us from Sisters, Oregon. Mr. Dan Fouts. So, Will Lutz to kick off after the Broncos. goes 72 yards, and the Chargers, who were three and out on their first opportunity, take over at the 30. Well, let's see how this Chargers offense answers. This is a game they do not want to get away from them. We talked about repeatedly how last week finished, that second half against Tampa, and how both sides of the football, they were frustrated. But as a first-year head coach, they talked about, guys, we're going to have weeks like this. What are we going to do about it? How are you going to respond to it? Now they're down 7-0 after just one possession. The Chargers have now, last week and tonight, given up 37 straight points without scoring. Herbert, play action, swings it out, looking for room, finds some to the inside. Nice move to the 41. Goes Scott Matlock, much like Patrick Richard in Baltimore, a guy who plays offense, defense, and special teams. He's all over the place. How much fun is he to watch a 300-pounder out of the backfield? You know, Ricard at Baltimore. Greg Roman's got to be thinking he's the same kind of guy. How about the nifty moves there by the 300-pounder? By the way, this guy's played defensive line his entire life, and they moved him at the second preseason game to fullback. So he's just getting a better feel every single week, and Harbaugh and Roman always have that kind of guy in their office. A mixed-round pick out of Boise State a couple of years ago. And meanwhile, that is Gus Edwards' short game. To Kaylee we go. Guys, as the Chargers offense tries to figure some things out, their secondary needs to. They've dealt with a lot of injuries, especially at safety, and now another, Marcus May, who you saw go down on that last drive. He's now in the x-ray room. We're told he's questionable to return with an ankle injury. They're minus. Molden is a starter. Cam Hart, back up. He's out of the game. Alohi Gilman's out. Alohi Gilman. Yeah. Needs three, gets a lot more than that. Off to the races, tripped up inside the 40-yard line, goes Kalani Bidal, a rookie out of Troy, sixth-round draft pick. Well, we saw Matlock have a nice catch. Now he goes back to doing what he should do, and that's leading the way for the running back. And Bidal gives you a little bit more juice back there. You know, he's got the low center gravity. He can get you upfield a lot quicker than Edwards. And this is Matlock again. Ability to make that block right there in Sternad. And opens that up on that left side. Right out. 5'8 and 215. Bring Edwards back in. Edwards at 6'1 and 238. Picks up about three. What they're trying to do to this Denver defense is not easily done. And Vance Joseph really switched things around as a coordinator with his Denver defense in year two. In the past, not to get too technical, it used to be more of a gap-and-a-half, two-gap kind of defense, meaning the defensive line would get their hands on the... And the teams with six wins. Denver won the toss. They defer. The kickoff will be into the end zone and back. We'll come to the 30-yard line to begin things. on this Thursday night opening game of the 16th week. Justin Herbert. 16 touchdowns, only two interceptions. One of them came in week two against Carolina. The other came in the game last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. So the Chargers coming off without question their worst game of the season. How will they rebound? Was last week an aberration or a harbinger? we'll find out tonight from the 30-yard line to begin on the ground with a gain of about four yards, Gus Edwards the former Baltimore Raven takes it out there, he's minus his mate J.K. Dobbins who will be their number one back, he's been out for the last four weeks, they hope to have him back in their next game at New England let's hope J.K. is able to come back next week it's a different offense without him in there we can talk about that over the last three weeks what they've done, they've missed just the juice Just the quickness that he provided to that running game. Much more physical and downhill with Edwards in there. Yeah, Dobbins averaging 4.8. And Edwards averaging 3.4. Takes the swing pass and is out of bounds. It'll be third down and three. Run out there by Brandon Jones. You'll see this offense tonight. Greg Roman is the offensive coordinator. He and Jim Harbaugh have a lot of history together over the years in college and in pro. There he is. of course was in Baltimore with his brother John for a number of years so familiar with the culture and what they want to do but tonight you know a bit shorthanded without Dobbins the battle in the trenches especially in the interior is key going three tight ends and come the other way and gets sucked at the 35 but there's a flag Cody Barton made the tackle blow we saw him against New Orleans on a Thursday night earlier this year. He was tremendous. Penalty will be declined. Penalty is on race on Slater. So it's a very fast three and out for the Chargers. This defense can fly. The holding calls on the left tackles Slater as you mentioned. He's going to pull around and once he gets out here he just gets locked up. But look at the defense. Look at the white jerseys flying to the football. Knowing that this offense is trying to find playmakers and a bit again a little bit predictable with that play calling here, just kind of feeling things out. J.K. Scott sending it down toward Marvin Mims, who's one of the best in the league at returning kicks, but won't have an opportunity here since he calls for and makes the fair catch at the 29-yard line. So Bo Nix, first-round pick, sixth quarterback pick. Been a gem so far, 20 touchdowns, 11 interceptions. Coming off a game in which he had three touchdowns and three interceptions, but he found a way to win last week against Indianapolis. You know, I think as a rookie, a lot of people looked at that as the way he responded to those interceptions. Yeah, he made some bad decisions, threw the ball into coverage, but I think it's how you respond. That's what his coaches and his teammates were really happy to see. Jaleel McLaughlin is out tonight, one of their running backs. They move guys in and out. They'll start on the ground here over the right side. Nice little game here for Javante Williams. taken down by Dayon Henley who leads the team in tackles. You know, if this team is going to you talked about the playoffs, the possibilities and if Denver's serious about that they're going to have to get better and Sean Payton would be the first one to tell you it's been big talk it's been talked about a lot in Denver, the running game, the lack of that running game and I think Eskimo is going to get more opportunities to show what he can do the rookie out of Notre Dame. Again on the ground. and trying to work his way for a first down is Javante Williams, and he has it. He's out at the 40-yard line. A nice hole there. It opened up. Javante Williams is a guy that, when he came out four years ago out of North Carolina, there was a lot of big expectations of what he can do. Of course, has some injuries. Been waiting for him to kind of come back and be that type of back right there where he fights for that second and third effort to get you the first down. He did it there. Marvin Mims lines up in the backfield now the wide receiver they toss it to him a lot of speed gets around the corner but then is forced out about Bosa is right there to force him out after a short game get a 2, second down and 8 Sean Payton has come out and said recently about we've got to find ways to get 19 to football we see what he can do as a returner And right away. ...lead 21-10. It's 05 Stadium in England. What you saw in this play. Yeah, Al, it's legal for an offensive lineman to engage a defensive lineman on his initial charge and drive him downfield. But here are 77 chips and then goes downfield on his own well beyond one yard. They should have left the flag down for an ineligible downfield. This is a foul. Yep. Well, you saw a penalty marker. You saw the official put his hand on the top of his head, and you can see what Jim Harbaugh is thinking about as they give him the explanation. So they get away with one. They have an 11-point lead to the Broncos, and the Chargers will get it with 6.22 remaining in the first half. Well, the Chargers, right now the Chargers, Philly, and Denver giving up the fewest points in the league. But over the last four quarters, last two quarters in the Tampa Bay game on Sunday, look at that, 517 total yards and 48 points. Yeah, and you can look at a number of different things. Elijah Moulton's not playing tonight. Gilman, they're starting safety out. Cam Hart out. They saw May, Marcus May go down. But I'll tell you, the big thing is their Alphys, Joey Bosa, Khalil Mack, just you don't even really feel their presence out on the field at all. He's probably playing through some injuries, especially Joey Bosa. Could be second week in a row. Gus Edwards, pickup of a couple. Tackled by D.J. Jones. A little extra stuff going on with Hurst and one of the Broncos. Second down and eighth. They're both Mack and Bosa trying to look at a little film, trying to make some adjustments. The biggest thing I think we see from up here is with a lot of new faces, just want to see more energy, more guys flying to the football. Oh, there's Gus Edwards. That's not a good sign, obviously, with Dobbins hurt. Rydell is going to be the back right now. They send him in motion. Herbert comes to the right side, and it's brought by Joshua Palmer, but for a very short gain and a third down coming up. Helps to have experience for, like, Justin Herbert. When you get into a game like this and the defense is searching, and they haven't come up with stops as a defense. It puts a little pressure on that quarterback and that offense to try to keep pace with what Bo Nix and Denver's doing. At the time, you can press. You can feel that urgency to have to make a play. Herbert's going to have to avoid that. Third down and three. Herbert hanging in the pocket. Fires and not caught that time. Coverage good. Palmer passed a little bit behind him. Brandon Jones covering on the play in his fourth down and an L.A. punt forthcoming. Well, that is a tight window to go between Sertan and zone. You're going to try to throw it over topper Sertan, who's usually in man, but this time zone, and then get it in there before Jones can come in and separate Palmer from the football. Puts it on a line, but just behind him a bit. Tough catch there for Palmer. First in completion for Herbert. He's down eight out of nine. sky-high punt. Fair catch call for made by Mims at the 21-yard line. Exactly five minutes left in the opening half. In the opening game of Week 16 in Denver, up 21-10. Three possessions, three touchdowns. They've already run 28 plays with 219 yards. Running back is the rookie, Blake Watson. Just called up. Active duty. Big toss. Knicks on the run. Chased by Bosa. Picks up the first hand and a few more yards. So for the second time tonight, Knicks takes off. He's game 15 and 10 on the two carries. That's a great call again by Sean Payton. You got Joey Bosa who's not at 100% gutting it out. So you go boop back the other way. What a challenge. He's chasing. Now he's got to go in the other direction. He's had a hip injury most of the year, trying to get through it. And you've got to catch up to this guy who's running. He can go now as a quarterback. Good call there on first and ten. You're so right, the hip injury. I mean, he doesn't look like he has looked to us in the past. First and ten, 420 to halftime. Knicks under pressure, and they finally get to him. So the Chargers have put no pressure on Mayfield last week for most of the game. finally get a sack, and that's Bosa. And here's Bosa. We're talking about him. He looks like he's gutting it. This time right off the ball. Look at the hands. You know, he's got the size and the power, but he's a technician. Good job with the hands. He gets off the block and just close. Oh, this is cool. Look at this. You're right. So, in 1976, Ray Wershing was kicking for, of all teams, the Chargers. And it was against Buffalo, and it ended the first half. Well, here we go again. Right. Every half a century, this comes into play. I mean, as much as these coaches do prep in OTAs and camp, how many coaches practice this? I mean, how often does this even come up in conversation? Every 50 years you practice this thing. Watch him put this through. How big is this? This would be a big. He's 8 of 9 from 50 plus. Let's go. Put it through. So, J.K. Scott's going to hold it. And this would make it 21-13 at the half if it's good. I mean, he takes all the time in the whirlwind. This is like warm-ups. Well, Marvin Mims is all the way back in case it's short, and he wants to run it back. So, Dicker, three years now, solving Chargers kicking lows for several years prior to that. Can he bang it through? On its way, it is. Yep. Made history tonight. Yes. There you go. Terry, great call. Pick up three. Sean Payton going, what did I do? That's 21-13. Traymond Smith is the guy with the fair catch interference Setting this baby up It's an eight-point halftime lead for the Denver Broncos Kaylee John, what were you thinking as that last play unfolded? Well, it's a fair catch-free kick situation We practice it He's got the leg, and so I think, look, the penalty put him in range Your offense, how do you explain what's allowed it to be so productive? Well, we've had pretty good balance. Our third down numbers are good. We stalled on that last drive, but we just got to make sure we're ready in the second half. I think it's important we're able to run the ball. Thanks, Coach. We can see it on your play sheet. You're reminding yourself. Thank you. Yes, we can. They do practice it. Yes, 2-20, I guess. 21-13 coming up after the break. The State Farm Halftime Show with our illustrious sponsor. They go back in the second half to rely on that offensive line and the rotation of the running backs where they were really dominating the line of scrimmage. Touchback. Denver starts at the 30. Let's take a look at our next kid's stats. It's powered by AWS, and Bo Nix doing such a good job on the run. You know, the two scramble runs for 25 yards and a couple first downs. You know, he leads the NFL in completions in yards throwing on the run. Tonight he's 5 of 6 on the run, 6 of 7, 48 yards and the two touchdowns. So, really, as we said earlier, look at this smile on the face says it all. Just feeling good, kind of in that zone. Let's see if he can keep that going here against his Chargers defense. And on the other hand, the Chargers are trying to find a spark to kind of get their dobbers up, start flying around a little bit more. Start on the ground. You know, the one thing about Knicks with Estimate picking up seven, you know, body language. Sometimes we make too much of it. But you see Knicks, and he looks like a guy in his eighth year, you know, who's been to the Super Bowl once or twice. Right. He just has that look about him. I still go back to that position. As so many of these college quarterbacks, the world that I live in so much, doing those college games for the last 30 years, they're all on a sprint to leave college and get to the NFL. And yet here's a guy that played 61. He had 61 starts in five years. And I think that experience allows him to play the way he is in the NFL. Stop a yard shot. Well, with NIL, they're not in that much of a sprint anymore. What a disaster. We could do a whole. Why don't we join the studio team and do a postgame? We could do a couple hours on it, although we've got Mr. Beast after. The whole thing. Yeah, we can't do that. Well, opportunity here for the Chargers. Big stop there on second down. Now they've got a shot here at third down and short. Ball up at the offensive lineman, kind of look into the backfield, three up the linebackers to make all the tackles. Now it's more pin their ears and get upfield. And with the addition of John Franklin Myers and Malcolm Roach, it's a very, very difficult defense to run on. Second and eight. Herbert. Good protection. Wide open. Making the grab. Taking down a couple of yards shy of the first down is Quentin Johnson. You know, we should point out, both of these teams, and along with the Philadelphia Eagles lead the league in fewest points allowed coming into this game. Yeah, they are doing a good job, not just against the run, but I think they're playing with a lot more confidence in what they're able to do in this attack. You know, Vance Joseph, been around the NFL for a long time, and I think the guys really are feeding off of his positivity and his energy much better this year. A quick pace here. Denver almost offside. Meanwhile, the catch is made. to the three-yard line goes Joshua Palmer. Fourth year, steady. Meanwhile, there was a flag for offside. Thought Denver was offside. They were. Yeah, you got a free play there with Penito jumping. So it's 4-0-6 to play in the corner. A gain of 24 yards and a first and goal for Los Angeles. The defense, eyes in the backfield off this play-action game, And because of that, there's a nice opening behind the linebackers in the safety six, P.J. Locke. And this is a play. Justin Herbert's as good as anybody on that play action, the timing and the rhythm. He puts it right on the money. He's four for four. It's Herbert for 43 yards. On the ground, through the middle, to the one. Gus Edwards to make it second down and goal. This is the eighth play of this drive upcoming. This has been a great drive and a great answer. See if they can finish this off. This Denver defense, second in the entire league in defending teams in this red zone area, preventing them from putting touchdowns on the board But right now this Chargers offense has a lot of momentum Edwards, the running back, first in motion. Got a lot of leverage coming into that backfield. And can he lean into the touchdown? Yes, he can! Gus Edwards, stopped just outside the goal line, and then that little lean to the shoulder, and then he goes. I'll tell you what, I was shocked that he was able to use his power. Jim Harbaugh's got to be fired up. Cody Barton hits him at about the two-yard line. This gives you an idea of the strength of Edwards. He gets hit right there, two- or three-yard line, but keeps his balance, keeps moving those legs, and gets across the goal line for the touchdown. Watch 55 come down. He's clean, makes the hit right there, does not wrap up until it's too late, loses the leverage, and good effort. I think they're going to check to make sure the ball broke the plane, and it looks like it did. It's confirmed. Matlock was also involved in that action. Cameron Dicker with the extra point to tie it up. And after giving up the last 37 points over two weeks, the Chargers needed that drive. 3-0-9 to go. First quarter, 7-7. Game time. Wow, tonight. I have seen that. Is it crazy? It's very cool. That's the most excited you've been in three years. Absolutely. On a read. I've got to be honest with you. But don't forget, we'll have some, you know, it says here, the promos coming up. Oh, yeah. But that's a good one. You're fired up. That was a good one. Even in a meeting, you're like, oh. Absolutely. I know this guy. Go over that guy. He's become a major enterprise. I'm going to do a little research by next week. I'll be ready to go in Chicago. For sure. All right, start at the 30. Well, let's look at that opening drive if you're just tuning in. Really great drive by the Denver Broncos, a team that's been criticized about their inability to run the football, and Sean Payton, a lot of different looks. Jumbo, 11 personnel, Pony, no backs, 12 personnel, some screens, but really it was the offensive line controlling the line of scrimmage. They know about Jim Harbaugh's reputation, but you know what? They like to pride themselves on winning the line of scrimmage and being physical as well, and they sure were on that. That opening drive to kind of set a tone. Nick's deep drop. Swings it out. Tackle's made. Just after the catch is made by Williams. Christian Fulton comes right up there to stop him after a gain of two. Justin Benner, the defensive coordinator from the Chargers, because of Sonny Samuel, who's a great corner, is out. Cam Hart's out tonight. He's playing a rookie, and Tarheep still, who's doing great with four interceptions. He's in a little bit of, he's an aggressive guy. He likes to play man-to-man, but he's playing more zone because of the corners and because he's got to protect them. That means you're going to see a lot of the safeties back often, and I think how Denver will attack because of that becomes interesting, not to mention they want to disguise and confuse Bo Nix. Extra pressure. Block is made up front. The pass is a little bit low. intended there for Troy Franklin makes his teammate at Oregon an incomplete third down and nine. The other thing to think about is Derwin James is a guy that throughout his NFL career he plays nickel, he plays safety he plays linebacker, I mean he is everywhere. With Jesse Minner it's a little bit more specific he and Derwin James meet all week and what his role is varies on the opponent tonight he's playing a little bit more safety because of the injuries. And now with May down, he definitely will have to play back more than he would normally play up tight. There he is about 8 yards from the line of scrimmage. Nick's under pressure. Going to keep it after taking a toss and picks up the first down with his legs after the 43-yard line. Just talking about Derwin James, and yeah, you're right. He started to kind of sneak down on his third down play. Watch him here, and watch the pump fake by the rookie quarterback. This is where he is so dangerous. He's elusive. He's past the line of scrimmage. Pump fake. And the veteran Derwin James falls for it. Just gives that little, he's playing a little basketball on grass, right? He gives him a little pump fake, head fake. Enough to get enough room for that first down. Nice play. Minute 40 in the quarter. Nice move. Zigging and zagging and finding the open spot. and estimate his worth of touchdown for a pick of their nine. See, I think this guy could be a great pro back. If you watched him in college, again, at Notre Dame, you know that he's got the size and the vision. Watch the guard pull around, and watch this. He feels that, puts the brakes on that block, and then goes under the block that's on Khalil Mack. That's great patience. That's great vision. And a lot of times running backs, rookies, they just make up their mind, and they run. That's an example of him being patient, letting the blocks establish themselves, and then getting behind to the leverage that's to his advantage. Had 18 rushing touchdowns in South Bend last year. Blake Watson in the game. Carrying through the middle. So the Broncos have already used four different running backs tonight. Estimates carried four times. Williams and Watson twice each. And Nicks himself. And then they had Mims carrying. So actually five guys have carried the ball already. And we've seen Mims in that role the last three or four weeks where he's had some opportunities to get in that backfield. Again, just looking for ways to get his hands on the ball. But I'm with you. It's a revolving door right now. The one thing that's constant is that offensive line winning at the line of scrimmage. Yeah, you can see. I don't like running back by committee. That's banal. I like Mike Tomlin, distribution of labor. Where that passes, whatever it is. Khalil Mack got his hands on it. So Mack, been around 11 years now, no stranger to the Pro Bowl, knocks it down. Okay, that's a good job of just working to the outside against McClinchy. Wins, and then just, there's the athletic ability. Again, talking to Jesse Minner, I found it really cool to hear that he said Khalil Mack, after all these years, 11th year, he still approaches every day with a chip on his shoulder. Not heavily recruited out of high school, went to Buffalo, and with all the success, still shows up every day at practice with something to prove. Second and ten. Weaning seconds of the quarter. That's caught. That's a first down. And that is Vele. Devon Vele, the rookie out of Utah. Seventh round pick. Josh Taylor knocks him out of bounds. And that will take us to the second quarter. End of one in L.A. Broncos seven. Chargers seven. Thursday night football. Can you believe? I think a lot of people are starting to believe. So as play resumes, second quarter on Michaels for 1st Street. Kaylee Hartung on first down. Play fake. Pass is caught by Courtland Sutton. They're leading receiver making his first grab of the Niners tackle there by Bullden for a 4-yard pickup. here's an example of trying to disguise the full Bo Nix they start out with a too high safety look with Derwin James and the snap of the ball they go there and they go there but he thinks the corner is going to drop but in reality he really doesn't they try to give it there to McConkie Herbert 11 out of 12 fires and that's his only his second incompletion. He's hit eight different receivers already. We're going to go back to the previous play. There's the blitz, and here's that deep crosser that McConkie is so good at. Look at him throw right through that pressure. Helps being 6'6 to be able to make that throw. Didn't get a whole lot on it, but look at the accuracy. This kid is playing through an ankle pain, getting hit, dealing with it, and just battling tonight. 90 seconds to the half. Extra pressure. Here's the blitz. They beat it with a pass too much. Conkey, who's just taking that just about at the line to gain. It should be a first down. Locke and Jones make the tackle. Clock keeps running. They have all the timeouts left. You may want to keep an eye on 15. I mean, of all the guys you're going to leave wide open, it's the second time on this last few plays that McConkey's had nobody on him with these blitzes. Going to respot the ball. It's like they're going to review the spot. Just inside the 27-yard line. So 107. They may prematurely move those chains. Taking a look, a little replay assist. That was a gain of 10 yards or 9-7-8 or 10-8. That's the answer here. eventually. They haven't blitzed a lot in this entire first half, and they blitzed here a few times with those linebackers, and it's opened up that second level, and they found McConkie a couple times. Yeah, he looks like he's about a half yard short. Yeah, so let's move the chains back. The chains have been moved to what would have been a first down, and now apparently with some replay assist up top, No challenges in the last two minutes. After review, the runner was short of the line to game. It'll be third down at that spot. By rule, this commercial does require a 10-second runoff. Please set the game clock at 1.25. Run 10 seconds down to 1.15, and the clocks will start on my signal. 1.15 on the game clock, please. Advanced math here. Play clock at 30 seconds. The impressive thing is, he said there was some authority. No question. They got the clock right. We're ready to play ball here. We think. So that makes it third down and entries. Gus Edwards, by the way, limped back. He's been out there. Herbert's going to keep it himself And that will be a first down It's a 26 yard line Bach continues to run Taking it down to 60 seconds And inside a minute See if Denver keeps blitzing Or if they pull back a little bit Very good red zone defense First attempt from the 26 Herbert dances in the pocket Fires intercepted at the goal line. Chris Abrams Drain, who had a great game last Sunday against Indianapolis, and the rookie out of Missouri with a giant play here. He's playing off coverage, and how great is that? We've talked about the rookie on the other side to the Broncos' Bo Nets, but how great is it to be able to see a rookie with your starting corner, Riley Moss, down? You've got to turn to a rookie. And watch his eyes play in zone the whole time, reading the quarterback, and that's what allows him to get a jump on that football. He had positioned himself perfectly. See the fumble, but he has plenty of time to get the grip on the ball. Puts it on the money, but that's all on Abram's train. Reading the quarterback, putting his body in position, tracked it, stepped in front, and comes up with a pick. He's getting more and more confident every single week. He gets a chance to be out there. Made his first start last week and made the most of it. And that's a killer for the Chargers right now because it's going to be 11 points or more at the half. Denver can do something, and the Broncos are going to get the ball to start the third quarter. Nix goes underneath, looking for room. There is none. Tackled to the 15-yard line. Catch made there by Gervonta Williams. Yeah, he's Rhythm that he is in and maybe the pressure will help there's James walking up again. He's up here And through the back we'll go five wide here's names and then just take it down to the 23 yard line So it's Tony Jefferson again making that play got fourth down and three He's gonna kick it this time In comes the field goal group maybe get the points back that they lost at the end of the first half. Really, their own play calling opened up that opportunity for the Chargers. Chargers ready to go in at half. And then with that incomplete pass, stop the clock and lose the timeout. Harbaugh called the timeout and said, hey, why not? What do we have to lose? Maybe we'll get a block. Maybe we'll get a run back. Maybe we'll get a free kick every 50 years. This kick by Lush is good from 41 yards out. So the Broncos are back up on top by 11. 20. He's used to these reclamation projects. It reminds me a lot of, like, Larry Brown in basketball. Everywhere he left, he went. Yeah. He turned it around. College, pro. And this one is a touchback. So what's at stake in this game tonight? If Denver wins, they're in the playoffs. A winner or a tie. First playoff first since they won the Super Bowl back in 15 with Peyton Manning and Von Miller and company. Chargers win. They don't mathematically clinch, but 97% chance. Even with a loss, the two-game advantage over the teams that are out of the wild card picture right now. Still three-quarters of a chance, 74%, to get to postseason. Herbert throws. That's caught. So here's a story. Dan Fouser is watching the game. We talked about Dan before. He calls our information guru, Steve Hurd, in the truck and says that kick in 76, he had to convince Tommy Prothrow, the coach of the Chargers in 76, it was legal. So Dan Fouser, we assume Dan is not fibbing to us. Right. He gets credit for it. No, not Dan. That's great. Think about that. How about that? We kind of just keep taking that story. We keep taking it forward a little bit. That's just embellish it like crazy. There you go, Dan. That way, Dan. Second and four. From the 36. Off the fake. Herbert. Dancing. Running. Looking him go. To the 45-yard line. Bad wheel and all. Yeah. 20 yards. So we know how athletic he is when he's healthy. This is just determination and toughness. There's nobody open downfield. Checkdown's not there. So his instincts take over. Cody Barton trying to swipe at the football. But this guy is a big man. He takes off. He's 6'6", 235 pounds and can go. an 18-yard scamper. No hole there for Vidal as he's taken down a couple of yards past the line of scrimmage, second and eight. It's one thing to get through the week of practice and the ankle's not feeling good, but you get out here, you get the competitive juices going, you're down 11, the clock's ticking down the third quarter, you've got to make a play. This is why his team respects him so much. It's why Jim Harbaugh talks so glowingly about him. It's not just his physical ability. By the running back. McConkie inside. Off the bay. Fires over the middle. Caught. And finding his way for the first down. Tucker Fist. One of their three tight ends active tonight. So he makes his first grab of the night. and Herbert is really sprinting around that's nine different receivers, nine watch the linebackers and his safeties look how they just sink they're just trying to take any threats away downfield, kind of putting a shell on the defense and we've seen Bo Nix with a lot of these moves, Zach Allen just making sure, just a little friendly tap there on the follow through, but we've seen Bo Nix do it, and now we've seen Herbert with those check downs for first down yardage by Doug. He's going to be taken down from behind that. Zach Allen reaching around, stopping him in his tracks, second and long. I think this guy's one of the most underrated players in the entire NFL. Watch the get-off. We talked about in the past how he played with J.J. Allen when they were the Cardinals together. Just lining him up in the backfield. It's just another way to try to get his hands on the ball and try to get into the corner and pick up some positive yards there on a first and ten play. And maybe get him into that Debo Samuel role. Yep. Second and seven have scored after a gain of three. Four-man rush. Great protection. Fired over the middle. And a couple of yards shy of the first down is Michael Burton, the fullback. So third down and two for Denver. Nice decision. A simple decision, you would think, by the rookie quarterback, but he's a different guy than this Chargers team met in week six, where they really, this Denver offense, struggled mightily in that first matchup. And he's a different guy through this experience, the ups, the downs, and that was an example. It puts him in a better position here on third down by just hitting that check down. Williams back in as the running back. Mims in motion, circling. Give it to Williams. Williams for a first down. And all the way down to the Charger, 38-yard line. Tackled there by Tony Jefferson. Gain of 14. It's a really nice job by the right side of the offensive line. Watch the right guard, 77 minors, helps. And it climbs up to the linebacker there, gets his hands on Denzel Perryman. And, you know, I thought Denver couldn't run the football. What's going on here in this opening drive? They're moving people off the line of scrimmage, and his backs are running with authority. Looks good here in this opening drive. Now Blake Watson, they just brought him up. He is the running back. Played at Memphis. Three-agent pickup. Play action. Under pressure. He gets it away. The pass is caught here. And picking up the first down. They go to Nate Atkins. One of their tight ends. Atkins with a touchdown last week. So Derwin James put the pressure on. But Nick's right there to get rid of it. Watch how he comes off this play action. Watch the head. Right away turns it. So that means in case he gets pressure, he's got an answer. That's a really good job. It's an offense that he ran similar to what he did in college, whether it was at Auburn or Oregon. Off to play action, head turned, not surprised by Derwin James there, getting into his face in a hurry. Now the new running back is Audrick Estame, a rookie out of Notre Dame. Give it to him. A little hesitation. So you have Williams, you have Estame, you've got Watson. They've used Mim in the back. They've already had four guys at running back tonight. They're searching. You've got to give them a lot of credit. Jesse Minner has had a lot of success with this Chargers defense. They've had some injuries like everybody else at Week 16, especially on the back end. We'll see how they're able to hold up. They're protecting their corners tonight, having to keep those safeties back. And right now, the Broncos are making them pay for that, trying to get them out of that look where they can start throwing the football more. Second down and seven. Watson exploits that hold. Close to a first down here. Broncos on the move after the Chargers started the game with a three and out. Watch this. Coach warned us. Sean Payton warned us about this young back. Watch this cut right when he gets to football. This cut back right here. That's great vision. That's really a strength of his. is to feel the flow of the defense. They're overflowing. Play is designed to go right. Feels the blocking. Cuts it back and gets those great yards. That's almost seven yards of carry here. Yeah, he had almost 1,100 yards last year at Memphis. Javante Williams now back in. Come up in the pistol for the first time. Clap, clap, clap. Play clock goes to zero. Action up front. Play whistle dead. Clay Martin tells us it's been Powers. to make it a first and 15. Now, Clay Martin, it's the third time in our last four games he's traveling with us. Every week. Every week he's with us. Seems to be. So, Peyton calling in this play. This would be the length play of the drive. Only two passes so far, six runs. These guys ran for 49 yards for the entire game against the Colts last week, right? Against a Charger defense that was shredded by Tampa Bay. Off the fake going back Catches made good blocking down the sideline. That's Blake Watson flag comes in at the end So that was a first and 15 Picked up 13 yards, but we'll see about the call by Martin as he gathers the officials control of this locker room and that sideline as you've seen them all night yeah you can see that visually meanwhile the charges come across the line let's go back to you know don't forget russell wilson came in for two years okay tremendous trade the whole thing didn't work out so now they had to go to the draft meanwhile you had jared stidham who backed up brady for a while in new england you had zach wilson who was a starter with the Jets' high draft choice a few years back. It was a competition. But early on in the competition, you could feel it. And Sean Payton told us, I kind of knew it. I kind of knew it. And then I had to wait until later in training camp, later in preseason, to make the official announcement. And meanwhile, Mims was there. Kuna Ford having a fine season, knocking it down. It'll be third down and 11. I think Sean Payton saw it and fell on it. But I think more importantly, the veterans on the team were talking to Sean Payton and Vance Joseph and saying after just a couple days of OTAs privately, hey, man, we got a quarterback. And so long way to go. It's a great game. It's 14-10, but he's an impressive player. We'll see how this Chargers defense, looking for a break, looking to get off the field and get a stop. Third and 11. Deep drop. Checks it down. And the final thrust has netted the first down towards Javante Williams. Still making the tackle. Neen and 11. Got it. First down. You know, Bo Nix hasn't been touched tonight. And he's a guy that's pretty decisive. Has good feet. This time, Mack is double teamed. He got the tight end with a fullback there. Atkins helping out. But he's got time to sell it downfield. Just checks it down. Another smart play. And what a job there by Williams of getting north and south after that catch and knowing exactly where he needed to go for that first down. You're right. Chargers with no rush last week. Baker Mayfield barely had a shower after that second half. Wasn't touched. Same thing tonight. He offers his men's down the sideline. Lim stays inbounds. Being chased all the way to the three-yard line by Derwin James. finally stops him. 55. 55 yards. Really good job. There's Mims again in the backfield. Kind of that pony look. Now watch Derwin James' angle. He's a great player, but that's a poor angle that allows Mims to get outside and pick up all those yards. Eventually Derwin James picks him up, but remember he bounces around, plays different spots. You see how he came underneath. Maybe underestimated the speed and burst there of Mims, but Mims got to that corner, and he was able to get big yards down the sideline. Backed by the undershirt. First down, passes through the hands. That time of Javante Williams. Second and goal with six and a half minutes left in the half. Yeah, I think we're all kind of seeing the same thing there. That's a touchdown if he just kind of puts it out there. You know, one thing about Bo Nix, it's got so much competitive energy. Sometimes it affects how he goes through progressions, and sometimes on a throw he just needs to put a little touch on it. He throws that 90-mile-an-hour fastball, and it goes right through the hands of Williams. Estame is in the backfield. Already has a touchdown tonight. Second and goal. He keeps. He throws. Caught. Touchdown. Devon Bailey. And a flag is down. on the other side of the field at the four-yard line, an eligible man downfield. It's Chargers offsides. That's what it looked like to me. They walked up a defensive back, looked like he was starting to jump at the line of scrimmage. Maybe a man downfield. So the official put his hand on top of his head, which is that indication. Maybe off setting or legal man downfield. Now on the play for an incredible man down third. Number 77 was engaged blocking. Result of the play is a touchdown. They say Miners was engaged in blocking was Martin's pull. Back to the flag we're still. What a job he's doing tonight on the run. Miners right here. That's a new rule for me. I didn't realize. I mean, look how far he is down. and he's four or five yards downfield, but he's engaged in a block. Terry, I'm not familiar with that call. Three drives, three touchdowns. Will Lutz with the extra point. And the Denver Broncos, 39-yard line, third and a long yard. Mims is in the backfield. Mix, clean pocket. throws a strike. And all the way to the 42-yard line goes Troy Franklin. So the two Oregonians play together with the Ducks. First down. Yeah, give him a good time. Time by the offensive line. Pro 85 kind of clears it out. And then that opens up. A nice opening there. You saw the linebacker have to get a little bit of depth there. That's the rookie, Junior Colson, out of Michigan. Knicks again surveying, working through the progressions, Timing and rhythm. Again, on point. And there's that smile again. He is having fun. Mims again in the backfield. Toss. Drops it. Picks it up. Gets taken down. Just about at the line of scrimmage. It'll be a second down. That's just, even though he's been back there a handful of times these last three or four weeks, that's just a guy that's excited to make a play. Took his eye off the football. started to look where he was going to go before he brought it in. They've been pretty flawless with most of their execution. Look at the head right there. He just assumed he would be able to handle that ball, and normally he was. He has three hands, but just got away from him. On second and 12. Ready. Ready. Lee flicker. Mims. Back to Knicks. caught at the 41-yard line with Shratton. Adam Shratton played with Sean Baker for him at New Orleans. Short game there. Good job by Tony Jefferson and Derwin James. Remember, these guys, James has played a lot of football, but this is just testing the discipline of those safeties. They take away those shots downfield, so Nick's only choice is to check it down. But a good job again. Tony Jefferson was in the scouting department last year, retired from football, and came back this year, and with the injuries, he's out there playing. Tenth season in the NFL. Third down and seven. Extra pressure. Pass is caught. But he cannot pick up the first down. So Atkins make that grab. It's fourth down. Poloco making the tackle there. It'll be fourth and two. Let's see if Sean Payton decides to get aggressive. Kind of in that area where a lot of times you'll see coaches with the analytics at that 35 to 40-yard line. They're going to, especially the confidence they have right now in their scheme, they're going to be, it's going to go for it. At least line up to. It'll be a 53-yard field goal attempt. Do they go? Three receivers set to the right. Play clock at two. Pass is caught. And that's a first down to the 30-yard line goes Cortland Sutton. He knew exactly where he wanted to go with that football. He motions 45 Atkins in there to give him that extra blocker. And there he is already in position. Now you just get behind it. And I love that he didn't hesitate. He got rid of that football in a hurry, knew exactly what he wanted. Quickly got the ball out there. and pretty easy for Cortland Sutland with the advantage they had with the big pullback and the tight end out in front. Great design on the fourth and two. Threaten the fullback. Eskime is the running back. Eskime. Behind the line of scrimmage. They're tart. Makes a tackle there. Big group at 90. Second down. Second and 11. Here's our defensive alerts. And any time you see Derwin James come around the line of scrimmage, Defensive alerts means here's a threat. This is a guy that could be coming. Doesn't mean he is. In this case, he did come. And look at the athletic ability of James. He is so good. That's where he makes an impact on the game. He's having to play a little deeper tonight because they're depleted on the back end with injuries. At that time, they walked him up. And on first down, he makes a difference. Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Sutton wide right Knicks dancing Knicks throwing And incomplete. Mims was down there, but the coverage was good. Carhage still covering on the play. Still third down and 11 now. If you haven't noticed, at the end of the first half, and here now in the second half, The answer that Jesse Minner is coming up with is more pressure. He's been blitzing Derwin James. That time it was Jasir Taylor that came on the blitz. They're trying to get him unsettled, trying to get him to get out of this. Look, they're rotating a couple backs themselves with Vidal and Edwards both coming in and getting a chance to show what they can do. Without J.K. Dobbins kind of searching a bit in that backfield. Those guys are searching right now. Yeah, they are. Postman Max, what's going on here? Bronco's running roughshod. Picked up the blitzer, and then Herbert has to slide to his side. It hasn't been an easy year for just that he started in training camp. He had plantar fasciitis, and the initial reports were not very good, but he was ready by opening day. Third and five, they go no huddle here. A little tempo, yep. Four-man rush, throws, caught. First down. And that is Stone Smart tight end. So Stone Smart with Will Disley out, assuming the role is the number one tight end. And Herbert now has completed six passes to six different receivers. Yep. Mesh concept. A couple receivers crossing. Nobody picks him up. The reason you saw tempo, that's to prevent the Broncos from getting their nickel or their dime package in. So they had to stick with their base defense. That's an advantage for the Chargers. And a good job there by Greg Roman going with that tempo look. Out of the pistol this time. Edwards is the running back. Give it to him. Tries to cut it back. Takes it to the 23. Joan Ellis, 52. Takes the tackle. Gain a three-second down and seven as you look at Greg Roman. Yeah, Greg Roman is very well respected. Does a good job. Like I said, he goes all the way back with Jim Harbaugh, all the way back to Stanford days when Andrew Luck was a young quarterback. And then, of course, with him in San Francisco, had some great years there, and now back with him now that Harbaugh is back up into the NFL, leaving University of Michigan. Now you've got Hasan Haskins in the backfield for the first time. Little sidearm throw. Smart again. Trying to work his way for a first down. Very close. I don't know if there's anybody as good. I mean, there are a lot of great quarterbacks out there, but this guy on play action in the screen game, watch the mechanics and watch him sell this. Looking right, looking right, and then just slips it, like you said, kind of that changes the arm angle, sidearm around the defender, knows he's coming the whole time, just flips it right around him, and there's again Smart getting a chance to get his hands on the football. Nine and a half minutes left in the first half, third down in inches. Matlock steps up and the slot goes in motion hand of all to Edwards and he is stuffed in the backfield so they have leverage there but Zach Allen said he ain't going anywhere wow that was impressive that's just anticipating the snap count good job of dealing with that jumbo look look at the size and here's Allen right here he just got off the ball a lot quicker than everybody else. Just wanted to line a scrimmage with the getoff. Sawyer completely surprised. Look at him win, and then they set the edge on the other side. Just nowhere to go. Really good defense there. Have to settle for a 37-yard field goal attempt by Cameron Bicker. So they went from third and inches to fourth and three, and Harbaugh's decision is to put up three. How he's been able to play, and even tonight, just the command of this offense, just the confidence that he exudes. I mean, it's pretty special when you see a rookie quarterback play the way this guy is. Five years in college, three at Auburn, two at Oregon after that. What, 61 games he played? Yeah, I think that experience really helps him. He's been through a lot of adversity. His three years at Auburn, that was his dream school. He basically left there and said, you know, I've had enough of this and went out to Eugene, Oregon, and changed his entire career when he went out to play for the Ducks and gave him this opportunity where he's now a first-round draft pick and playing for Sean Payton in Denver. But, man, this guy just threw up with the game in the locker room with his dad since he was probably five years old. Just a coach's son, the epitome of that. Williams is the running back as they begin this drive. Broncos, two long touchdown drives. Start here. Williams looking for a block. Gets it. Picks up about four. Tartt making the tackle. We go to Kaylee. Guys, from the day Cortland Sutton first met Bo Nix, he felt he was more mature than most rookies. Sutton's been a captain in Denver for four years, and he told me it's impressed him to watch Nix's style of leadership with a C on his chest. Sutton said Nix has stayed true to who he is. He's confident, competitive, not afraid to speak his mind, and that's allowed him to take it. to look to think he would have an easy access throw to the flat. In the corner, Fulton a little bit tighter. So again, trying to get into the head of Bo Nix. Rolling, looking, throwing, caught at the 11-yard line. So he goes back-to-back to Corton. Trying to get to 1,000 yards this season. Tony Jefferson makes the stop. First down. Remember, you got a lot of guys that are trying to fill in with some of these entries. It's great to see 14 get his hands But look at a lot of the blue jerseys. Eyes in the backfield. There's nobody in that flat holding them. They're just kind of covering space. Look to the right. There's nobody out there. You see the back gets in their lane. But just nice down to finding the opening. And he is so good on the run. Exactly 900 receiving yards to this point. The season. Spinning. Still spinning. Still working to the three-yard line goes Eskime. What a job here by Cortland Sutton, who just made a big catch. This time he helps out. There's him on the far right, makes that block, doesn't hit the defender in the back, and then tough running. This is what we're talking about from Estime. Just would not be denied. Look at that. Last three-plus quarters. This defense talked about having a chance again to come out with some energy. He's just not seen it yet. Second down and one. Denver already 73 rushing yards to the outside. The pass is caught and taken down just about at the first down marker. Very, very close as they check out. It will be a first down. Mims makes the grab. Fulton with the stop. That's a heck of an effort there by Fulton because well designed again by Sean Payton. Used the motion, trying to create the matchup. Remember, you've got two blockers on the other side. Fulton knows. Fulton knows he's got to make that play. He's got to beat him to the corner. From the very beginning of that motion, he knew it was a foot race to the corner, to the other side. And he gets his helmet across to keep him out of the end zone. Great play there by seven. Twelfth play of the drive. Burton the fullback. Williams is the running back. Take to Javante. Knicks rolling, looking, throwing, caught. Touchdown. Michael Burton the fullback. Sean Payton's got the heater working tonight. He's got it going tonight. And you give Sean Payton an offensive line that's playing the way they are, everything opens up. Burton's going to work out to the flat, love the call. Now it's a foot race. And you bake the defender to you to be able to make an easy throw to the fullback for that touchdown. But right now, everything is working for this Denver offense. A thing of beauty, really. Lutz wants to make it 14-7, which he does. Every coach wants perfect balance. Sean wants to run, but he's run 11 times. He's thrown 11 times, and he has a seven-point lead. One of these teams will have a 2-5 record after tonight. That's right. They have to. I love watching Bo Nix during TV timeouts. I mean, the guy is involved. No question who the leader of this team is. Davis takes a knee. Paul comes out to the 30. Look at Herbert. Yeah, look at Herbert. This is when he's healthy, 100% healthy against the Bengals week 11. You can see his left ankle's fine, able to work through it. This is tonight. See that big brace that Kaylee talked about on that left ankle? See how he's just, when you have an ankle like that on that left foot, You just cannot drive and throw with the same authority with your lower body. Your lower body impacts the velocity and the accuracy so much. Now, he is 4-4 tonight, so he's overcoming it. Tough guy. He's now 5-5. And that is Ladd McConkie, the great-looking rookie out of Georgia, who takes that one into Bronco territory. A gain of 27. You've got tight formation here. Watch the defensive back just kind of stare. He's not real sure who's going to pick both those crossers up. And a little bit of a miscommunication there. That was Brandon Jones, the safety, who's done a really good job this year. Coming over from Miami, in fact, leads the team in tackles. But that time, just a bust on the back end. Lydell is the running back here. Therese Davis in motion. and it's a game of about two to the 41-yard line for Kamani the rookie out of Troy second down. I think he brings a little bit of a drag on him about how he doesn't turn the ball over. You mentioned it early in the broadcast what it was week two his first pick of the year and then last week he threw his second and now tonight a big one. And Denver pretty content to let that clock run all the way down a couple of short throws here Williams the intended receiver 13 seconds third down at 13 So Knicks in the half. 15-21, 155 yards. Thrown for a couple of touchdowns. Unless somebody takes a timeout, that's going to take us two. Jim Harbaugh is going to call a timeout because of that incompletion on second down. He moved himself down right by the official just in case they ran the ball, and they did. A little bit surprised. It felt like Denver was trying to work the clock with a couple easy passes. Well, Harbaugh figured, hey, why not? Why not? Maybe we'll block a kick. Yeah. Maybe we'll get a run back. Yep. Yeah, he's right there, ready to go. He sees the run. He's like, all right, give me that timeout. Hey, Grace, your things have happened. No doubt. So you've got Dixon in for the punt. Darius Davis, who's dangerous, is back. Chargers trying to set up a return. Fair catch is called for. He goes down. Ball is loose. And whatever happens here with the flag down, the clock goes to triple zeros. And the Broncos think... They should get an untimed down here. That's exactly what I'm thinking right now. The gunner ran into the returner. And if so... Let's put Martin's call here in a second. I mean, if they give it to Denver, you got it with an untimed down. They have a chance to have a field goal. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, 15 yards here. Terry, what are you seeing here? It is fair catch interference, and it's a 15-yard penalty. We'll get him untimed down, and L.A. will have two options. They can either snap the ball, or they can do a free kick for a field goal, which we haven't seen in forever. We just said crazy things are going to happen here. And you're right, we haven't seen that free kick in years. So they're going to move the ball. They're on the march right now. Oh, Herbert looks like he's going out there. Penalty was on Tremont Smith. the ball's going to be spotted at the 47 so you'd be looking at if you wanted to kick a field goal it would have to be 65 yards yeah well the offense is out there and you think of your your top so yeah 30 seconds so of course you've got the picket fence back there for Denver goal line. So your option is Hail Mary or a free kick. Terry, what do you think? So if they do a fair catch kick, they're in a kick from where the ball is right now, from the 47-yard line. Correct. So make it a 57-yard kick. And they'll line up just as they would on a normal free kick. No, it can't be blocked, but they can certainly kick from where it is right now. You think Jim Harbaugh knows that? Somebody better tap him on his shoulder. I think he's getting that explanation right now. You just don't see this happen like you said very often. No. I was with you. I assumed you hit the ball right there. I've only seen one, I think. Good call, Terry. Yep, Dicker. Out of bed. Dicker, this is within his distance. I mean, he's as long as 59, especially in a free kick situation. Now, it can be returned. And if the ball's live, once it goes up in the air. The last time one of these was successful was 1976. It was your first year on Monday Night Football, wasn't it? 1986. Please, come on. You're older than I am. But I saw the game on television. You did, too, for your bassinet. That's right. Here it goes up. And that is a great job of holding on with his fingertips to secure that. Bosa fighting through injuries says, yes, we got it. So the Chargers right now. Going to take at least a few seconds off the clock here. Because you know that Denver's going to take its timeouts. So Herbert will stop it at the 48-yard line, 52 seconds. It's quite a feat what Jim Harbaugh has been able to do here in this first year. Think about some of the big names. Austin Eckler, Keenan Allen, Mike Williams, defense, Kenneth Murray, Eric Kendricks. Those guys are all let go. Jim Harbaugh comes in, tries to build this roster up kind of to his style of play. still had some crafty veterans like Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa, but they bought into him, his authentic style of being a coach. He always says, if you love football and you love playing for each other, then you and I are going to get along great. And that's really the roster that he tried to put together this year, and here they are at nine wins. New coaching staff, again, using some time, waiting to get tackled, and there it is in 48 seconds. So the Chargers looking at their path for the playoffs right now with a win. Win two of the last three guaranteed. So one of them is tonight. Yeah. They go to New England, then they go to Las Vegas. Yeah, they're both on the road, but you're going to be favored in both those games. And then you'd have to lose all three remaining games, and then Cincinnati, Indianapolis, or Miami would win all three of their remaining games. That would be the gut-wrencher of all time. I mean, the Chargers through the years, I said in our meeting, I can name all of these, you know, from Marlon McCree dropping a sure interception, which would have sent them to the AFC Championship game, to any number of nights when you want to go home and throw up, as I'm sure Dean Spanos has through the years. Jim Harbaugh asking Herbert to buy as much time as he could with those two timeouts and the shotgun. and it's going to be about three, three and a half seconds or so until they'll be able to use this last time out if they choose to use it. And then just somehow use those three seconds. Yeah. Should be relatively easy. Yeah. But in today's world, no predictions. Nobody knows anything. You know that. Okay. So, the game clock has run out, but they put a couple of seconds back on it. Please set the game clock to four seconds. To four seconds. Meanwhile, the Broncos pass to the playoffs. Take a look at that real quickly here. This isn't easy after tonight. Well, at Cincinnati next week and then Kansas City, and who knows what the Chiefs have in store that night. He's still fighting for that number one seed, Mahomes, and his ankle. Missed the playoffs. Lose all three. This is the first one tonight. And just throw it up in the air. And by the time it comes down, the Chargers have the victory. That's it. So the Chargers, who were down to 1.2410. Raising it into the first half to make it 2413. Stopping the clock, stepping out of bounds, 2.23 on the clock. Yeah, now you'll see Jesse Minner continue to mix the looks up, but getting a little bit softer, just doesn't want to give up anything easy. Rely on that front four to try to get the pressure on Bo Nix, maybe sprinkle in a blitz here and there, but playing a little bit softer now, protecting the corners, not giving up an easy throw downfield. That's caught up at the 46. Second down about four. Franklin makes the grab there. Conserving those two timeouts. Spock will stop at the two-minute warning. Try and get a playoff before that two-minute warning. And they do. And second and three. He makes it going to keep it. Flag is down. This is a moment. We've got a couple of flags. In fact, three. That's a holding call in the backfield on Denver. Right then, two downfield of the 45 of the Chargers. So Clay Martin has shorted everything out here. Maybe a forward lateral. He tried to get that, throwing it behind. But I think he might have, just by the way he was running so fast, that may have been a forward lateral. So you've got a holding call and potentially a forward lateral on Knicks. Well, the Chargers tonight have had only one penalty for three yards. He's going over to Harbaugh, which is good news for the Chargers. Basically giving him the option right now. It was. What's the first attempt play? Here's the hold by Bowles, the left tackle. Khalil Mack, you know, he doesn't always get sacks, but he can affect those offensive linemen where he gets around, works around and gets to leverage and creates that hole. And there's Nix again trying to make a play ball clearly as a forward pass. Look at the background of the Chargers players. Okay Multiple fouls on the play by the offense Illegal forward pass By number 10 The penalties decline Holding Number 72 10-yard penalty at the previous spot Will replay second down Alright, that's Bowles I don't like when a referee starts with okay Let's see what we got here That's the two-minute warning Comes with 154 on the clock And the Chargers on top. 34-24 on Thursday Night Football. That was. I'm going Fitz. Or Whit. I think it was remuneration. Yeah. Second and 13. Okay. That's whose idea it was. Knicks backs up Throws low, incomplete The third down and 13 Williams So again if the Chargers win Not mathematical But a 97% chance So you might as well start thinking about Travel plans for the playoffs They won't host a home game Because the division's already been seared by Kansas City And Denver still has a golden opportunity to get in. The one thing Denver has done is their first winning season since 2016. That's cemented already with nine wins. Third and 13. Knicks to the far side, and it's going to be a little short in the first half by three yards. Lucas Troll makes the tackles. He got fourth down now. Fourth and three to stay alive. Chargers doing a good job there, just giving up those underneath throws, tackling them inbounds. Let that clock continue to work. Big play. This pretty much play the game. Timeout by Jim Harbaugh. The Chargers take a timeout again. So what's at stake here in tonight's game? Just a refresh. Bronx winner tried. Clinch. I've been to the playoffs since they won the Super Bowl. In 2015, Chargers win and 97% chance to make the playoffs. You know, you took a little of these two franchises. Their two original American football league franchises came in together in 1960. The Broncos have been to eight Super Bowls, won three. Chargers have been to one Super Bowl and got skunked by Steve Young. Six touchdown passes. And they won 49-26. But at the end of the game, when I did that game, the Chargers almost covered. Oh, really? It was a pass into the end zone. It was an 18-point spread. Anyway. You weren't talking about that at all, were you? At that point, I wasn't allowed to. Oh, it's fourth and three. Here we go. From the 48-yard line. Can the Broncos stay alive here? Caught, and they do. Has the first down by a yard. That's pro. He's the 10th different. Each team has had 10 different receivers tonight. Yeah, they showed pressure, backed out of it. Good job by Bo Nix, identifying where that soft spot was. got the ball out. Knicks, good protection. Neal, you got Williams trying to get out of bounds and you get the first out and out of bounds. Now you're in a situation when you're down by 10, you can go two ways, of course. Get the field goal range. But then again, in today's world with the new rules and everything, getting an onside kick is tough. Yeah, and again, remember, you're giving up some passes underneath because you're taking away the deep shots, but you've got to do your best job that you can at tackling inbounds. Dean Leonard that time came up to force him back inside, but here it is. Yeah, they're going to trust him. Right here, a 55-yard attempt to try to make it a one-score gain and then rely on that onside kick, and Lutz's kick is good. So they make it 34-27, yeah, 57 seconds, and they still have two timeouts. Well, this could get interesting. It's still going to come down to that onside kick. It has to. Yeah, with the two timeouts. And they did as good a job as they could of trying to preserve and hold on to their timeouts on this last drive by trying to work to get out of bounds. Bo Nix managed that as well as he could, and they rolled the dice on that long field goal. Lutz comes through, and now it comes down to the onside kick. So there you have it this year, 7%. 45 onside kicks have been attempted under the new rules. Only three recovered by the kicking team. Knicks open for one more shot. Clint, if they do obviously recover it, you're talking about having a ball in a really good field position a couple timeouts. It all comes down to this kick recovery, chance to tie this game up, and if you don't, game's over. Well, we saw a crazy ending to the first half. What about the second? Got the good hands guy up front. The guys along the 45-yard line. Kick has to go 10 yards unless it's touched by the defenders first. And let's see what Lux has in mind here. So many different ways to try this. Put it up conventionally like that. Put it on its side. Pretend you're going to the right side, go to the left. What's he going to do? He had a whistle before he tries it. Again, timeout. Yeah, timeout. Timeout. The Chargers wanted to see what they had in mind. And they'll probably have something else in mind, I would think. It is amazing to think of the Broncos. Great history and everything. Last time they played in a playoff game, it was Peyton Manning's last game. He rode off into a Rocky Mountain sunset. Von Miller had a little something to do with it that day as they beat Carolina in a defensive battle at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. last time the Chargers were in the playoff game they don't want to think about it they got rough 27-0 to Jacksonville and lost the game he had a practice kick here see if that helps looking for that big hop hey got the big hop but the Chargers came up with the ball Nick Neiman who's a linebacker was up there. They got that exact hop that they wanted. That's it. But Neiman was there. Yeah, really good reaction by the linebacker. Usually it's a receiver or running back that has those great hands. But that ball did exactly what Denver wanted. This is what you practice, what you hope for. Right there, into the first half, they gave the three points, declined this one. But still, you'd like to avoid helping the Chargers out. They got the momentum right now. That one was called on Tillman. You had the personal foul earlier on Cooper. Minute and a half into the fourth. First down. Green pocket. Throw is caught. McComkey cuts it back to the 19-yard line. Ladd McConkie, what a difference he's made this year. Because of salary cap issues, they had to get rid of Mike Williams. He traded Keenan Allen. McConkie comes in, he's taken over as the number one guy. They use a mesh concept and then a delay by McConkie. So there's a huge opening. Greg Roman and his offensive staff, they don't have a ton of weapons other than McConkie on the outside, but they're coming up with creative ways to create space to get him a chance to not only make catches, But to have a chance to run after the catch. Eight straight with 50 or more receiving yards. Herbert. Throws. Court. Touchdown. Darius Davis. And the Chargers take the lead on a 19-yard touchdown pass. Now, I just talked about Greg Roman coming up with ways to find matchups. Here's the motion right here. Watch the defense react late. Eventually six, T.J. Locke comes down. But this is all Justin Herbert. With that gimpy ankle, he gets hit by Zach Allen. I think he was thinking about throwing this ball away at the last minute. He locates his open receiver and makes this throw to Darius Davis. What a gutty effort again tonight by the quarterback, Herbert. Going for two. Leading by one right now. Davis, with his first career receiving touchdown, had one on a punt return. Second year on the TCU. Haskins is in the backfield. Big through him. Herbert steps up. Throws. And is it one hand in the court? Yes, it is. Joshua Palmer with an amazing catch. Go dancing on the back line Reached up one hand Holds it in How about He just kind of Bats the ball up to himself He's been waiting to have a chance To have an impact And make a play To help these guys out There's Jim Harbaugh Giving him a hug Look ball taps Keeps his focus Leans Makes that catch gets both feet down Amazing Three L lead Herbert, he's going to get it tipped at the line of scrimmage, barely. That's a great effort, but this is amazing concentration. That's a quarterback that's determined. Look at this ball, tipped by Sternad. It's that much more impressive, the concentration and a two-pointer by Palmer. Every week in almost every game we see amazing catches. Odell Beckham just, you know, he broke the seal on all this stuff back in 2014. Touch back here and we will be back in 30 seconds. Back at SoFi Stadium. 12-23 left in the fourth. Chargers on top. 27-24. Denver trying to clinch a playoff spot. Chargers trying to make it a 97% probability with a victory. Drive starting from the 30-yard line. On the ground. Backing his way, game of five. Estime, second down. We talked about Jesse Minner and his defense, and where's the energy? It's two weeks in a row where they've been a little sluggish. Boy, they turned things around in the second half. Think about that first half to second half. Look at the yards. 236 to 55, the drive chart. Denver started this game their first three possessions touchdown touchdown touchdown since then it's punt punt field goal and punt so the adjustments have been made the energy and this defense is flying around here in his last few possessions second and five and down he goes he gets it away the pressure put the kid continues to show this toughness. See that left ankle wrapped up with that brace. Big first down there on that third down run. No flag. McMillan hit him and he was still in bounds. Three and a half to go. Nice hold. Edwards. Edwards in the Bronco territory. Still rambling. Still rolling. Loses the ball at the end. And was he down at the 30-yard line? And they're saying yes. Starnett knocked it free with effort. He was down 44 yards from Edwards out of nowhere. His longest run in five years. He hit that downhill in a hurry because that offensive line opened it up. He's clearly down. Now it's just a matter of where they're going to spot the football. But that hole opened up and the rookie Joe Alt made a big block to open it. First half 31. Again. And pushed back. And shown down. Peyton's going to use his first time out. So it'll be second and 12 when play resumes. Go back to that big run. And any time you're in this situation, you want to get behind Scott Matlock, the big fullback. But watch the tackle on our left. Really good job of securing the blocks, able to get up to that next level. What a future he has. But isn't it great to see Gus Edwards run like this? Takes you back to those Baltimore Ravens days when he was such a great back. Had so many big games. A lot of times he's had second back. physical that time showing some quickness once he got to that second and third level of the defense. But 14 carries tonight, 68 yards. He's the leading rusher up until that run. Herbert was the leading rusher, and what a play that was on third and 10. Haskins is now the running back. Second and 13. Herbert. Little shovel dump pass to Haskins. Inside the 10. Touchdown Chargers. That is a 90-yard drive in two minutes. 34 yards to the end zone. The Herbert play. The Edwards play. Now Haskins. They dialed up the pressure thinking they could affect Herbert that time and they got to him. But I'll tell you whether he's been running and getting outside and utilizing his legs even with the ankle issue or just buying time and finding check downs. This time, as you said, Al, it's a shovel pass to a guy that hasn't had much of a chance to do anything. You know, Hassan Hastings, his reputation going back to his college days is a power back at Michigan. Played for Harbaugh. Yeah. In Ann Arbor. He just wanted a chance to show what he can do and make a difference. How about this check down? Now what are you going to do, big man? I'll show you what I'll do. Breaks one tackle, makes a move in the open field, and then shows the speed to take it all the way to the house for a touchdown. What a job by Justin Herbert of just fighting tonight, knowing what's at stake for this franchise and this team in year one with Jim Harbaugh. Five wins a year ago to what they're doing right now. On the cusp of their ninth. Well, last week they ended the game giving up 30 unanswered points. At the moment, they have 21 unanswered points. And eight by ten. Now they wanted to see how their team would respond. That was a big theme on a short week. You get out, score 27-0 in a game where you had to lead at half. They were embarrassed. How would you respond? They started slow tonight, down 21-10, but they kept fighting. That's really what this Jim Harbaugh, talk about the culture. That's what this culture is about, that mental toughness, that resiliency. And, man, it's hip and on display tonight. Yeah, well, last week after that game, you were wondering if you were a Charger fan. Is that an aberration? Or does it foretell the near future? Is it a harbinger of bad things to come? And they've answered it relatively definitively tonight. And the way it started, we thought, oh boy, it's a continuation of last week. Knicks, that's caught. That's a first down right now. And it won't, just in case you wanted. Here's the way the wildcard matchups would look in the AFC. The Chargers would play the Bills in Buffalo. The Broncos will go to Pittsburgh and play the Steelers, and then the Ravens will play the Texans in the 5-4 matchup. A lot can happen between now and then, but the Broncos can clinch a spot tonight. Chargers, all but mathematically, clinch out. You've got Baltimore and Pittsburgh going back and forth, you know. And Kansas City keeps the number one chief. Yeah, that's your appetite. It's exciting for what could be here in the next few weeks. From the 30-yard line, they start this drive with a loss behind a line of scrimmage as Blake Watson goes nowhere. To the field to Kaylee. Guys, Justin Herbert was just getting a cut above his right elbow tended to. I'm guessing that happened when he went trying to barrel into the end zone. He's treating it like it's nothing more than a paper cut, I'd say. The bigger problem for the Chargers defense, though, is that linebacker Denzel Perryman is questionable to return. We haven't seen him since he went into the locker room during halftime. Tonight was his first game back after missing four games with a groin injury. It backed it up again. Yeah, hadn't mentioned his name once tonight when he was out there. Second and 11. A little swing pass out here. Williams. And he'll take it to the 31. And that's all. Third and eight coming up. Well, they look like they're flying around a little bit. Playing with a little bit of a different kind of energy. Big opportunity. Maybe reacting to that score there by their own offense. Put the crowds back into it. Kind of 50-50 split of the crowd, by the way. It's always a big story any time there's a home game for the Chargers. A lot of Broncos fans here in town, but right now these Chargers fans are making a lot of noise on this third down. Yeah, the Chargers and the Rams all practice silent count for home games. Third and eight. Nick's throwing. Contested. And who's got it? A fight for the ball. You got James. You got Williams. Chargers think they have it. I think Thurman James came up with that. As they hit the ground, he was taking that football away. Clay Martin is right there. What's he going to tell us? who's got it Martin he patched James but he gave it to the chart he gave that to the the Broncos why I tell you when they hit the ground it sure looked like live that he did a good job of stealing that football fighting for it let's see here's a good look at it see that well maybe maybe William still had it maybe he used his strength to keep it away from him tie goes to the runner Riley Dixon plops it out of bounds just around the 20-yard line so 45 seconds are left in the penultimate quarter otherwise known as next to last And it's 24-19. And we'll be back in show five after this. Just in case you're wondering. Justin Herbert, what he's been able to do with play action. He's second in the entire league when it comes to play action. You can see 10 of 10 entering this drive, utilizing play action, and getting into that rhythm that he finds with that look. Off the face. dancing, throwing, caught on the run. That's Joshua Palmer. We're going to look at that arm, that elbow. Kaylee calls it a brush burn. So the ankle seems to be fine, but the elbow seems to be fine right now, at least on this first pass. And so does the pass protection. He worked through his progressions. It was almost like watching a video game. You're watching him sit back there and just threw an absolute laser right on the money. Now 11 of 11. Off of that play-action look. And 17 of 20, which is 85% on the night for 194 yards. Waning seconds of the quarter. And Edwards will take the ball out to the 38-yard line. And that's where we will start the fourth quarter. On this Thursday night with the Denver Broncos leading the Los Angeles Chargers. 24-19 on Thursday Night Football. Those three teams at the top here, Ravens, Broncos, Chargers in great shape to get the postseason. Meanwhile, the Colts, Dolphins, and Bengals sitting on the outside looking in and need a lot of help. You know, if you're Denver, you don't want to have to rely on those last two games. They have Cincinnati and Kansas City. On by Huitelotu, who leads L.A. with seven and a half sacks. Nick's pleading whatever Casey's pleading here. Third down and five. And he must be intentional grounding. I'll tell you what's been interesting here is Bo Nix is not getting the ball downfield at all tonight. Most of his throws have been short. In fact, I mean, if you look at the average distance tonight, 2.6 air yards. That's the shortest by any quarterback the entire year. Third down and five. Only a three-man rush. Next dumps it off, caught, and taking it out to almost midfield is Michael Burton. So the safety ball. Val makes the play, picks up the first night game of 14. They played man-to-man. Henley actually has Burton out of the backfield. Delay, delay. He lets him go. Just free release and a good job by Bo Nix. All this pressure, loud as this stadium has been all night. And he finds that check down once again. Who gets away from Henley who lost his eyes in the backfield that time. Looking for Nix as a threat to potentially scramble for the first down. Rookie Watson in the backfield. Play fake. Going deep. Has him in. And it's going to be broken up at the very end. Intended from Mims. Tarheem still was able to get back there. High floaters gave still enough time to get back and make the play. Just talked about how it's been a lot of short throws. They're saving these deeper shots for the fourth quarter. Out and up. And the rookie fell for it. The ball is late. It was high in the air, but it was late. And that's why the ball was underthrown. That's a touchdown. If he sees it and gets the ball out early, because it's late, it gives still a chance to catch up on it. He says, hey, that one's on me. I've got to get that one out earlier. Meeting about three or four more yards on it as well. Second down and ten. Left side. Williams. Stop just shy of the 50-yard line by Kudupoloko. Third and eight. This is like watching a different defense. From the first half to the second half. That's what O2 did a nice job of setting that edge. Remember, these guys were pushed around in the run game in the first half. It's amazing when you play this game with energy on that defensive side. Third and eight. Rush five. Chase him out. Throws down the sideline. Incomplete. And the Chargers will get the ball back after a fourth and eight for Denver. And the defense keeps doing their job. They get Bo Nix and this Broncos offense off the field. Troutman talking there about the adjustment maybe within a round with Sean Payton. but nonetheless, man, the Chargers playing and seeing things and winning the line of scrimmage which they could not do in that first half. Well, they were manhandled. Denver's had no running game at all in the second half. Meanwhile, Dixon sends it down and will be caught by the Broncos and down to the four-yard line. Traymond Smith got down there. Nice play by him. Chargers deep in their own territory. It was 9.48 left regulation. Lead by three. That's the end of the first half. Led to the free kick and three points here. This is a third down play on a scramble. He's short, but a late hit allows him to keep that drive alive. That was a touchdown. A horse collar. That led to eventually a touchdown by Gus Edwards. So Sean Payton's team was in command. Twice they had an 11-point lead. 21-10, 24-13. but they've lost control of this game at the end of the first half and really the majority of this second half. That Marine layer coming in. SoFi Stadium. Home of the Chargers. Home of the Rams. Home of Super Bowl XXI. Hastings is in the backfield as the running back here. Send Matlock over to the right side as they begin this drive. From the five-yard line. Pressure. Sacked. 35-yard line. But Dupree. Went around a long time. Came up with the Steelers. 10th year in the league. Free run. And a sack. There's a miscue here by the offensive line. Obviously, tight end Troutman. Watch him release. Watch the left tackle Bulls. Kind of in no-man's land. Miscommunication. With that tight end delaying and then releasing. You need 72 to bounce out there and help out. Obviously, you don't want Dupree to come in there basically a free running on the quarterback. Second Chargers sack. Second and 20. Play clock at 2. Get the playoff on the ground. 7-yard gain here for Estime. Third and 13 upcoming. Bo Nix has not gotten the ball downfield tonight. And here we are late in the game. You wonder how many more opportunities do you get with 5.30 to go. Can he get the ball downfield? And can one of his receivers get some separation to help him out? Sutton would be the guy you would think doing a good job on him. He goes wide to the right. have to get to the 50, fires over the middle, caught at the 45, and trying to get to that 50-yard line, and coming up a little bit shy, having it to the 45, and the charges, Lucas Troll, stopped there by Derwin James, fourth and five. Derwin James is just, he almost did a league of his own, and he has been for a long time in his seventh year out of Florida State, kind of roaming back there, waiting for a crosser, comes off the crosser, now he's got to make a play in open field. and he is, you know, size-wise against Troll, who's 260. He gives up some, but he is determined to bring him down, and he does. Fourth and six. Fourth and five. Have to punt. Dixon goes down. Put some backspin on it. Fair court at the 10-yard line by Darius Davis. And the chess match begins now. Working the clock. Working downfield. Harbaugh calling that timeout at the end of the first half. A fair catch call for interference, which was a penalty. And at the end of the half, you had this free kick. No pressure. Guy can put it down. Kicker can bang it through. 57 yards. Turn would have been 24-10 and 24-13. And provided enough of a momentum shift going into the third quarter. Yeah, and I'm sure that Sean Payton's going to go back and look at that and just be frustrated with the play-calling decisions. A couple passes early, one of them incomplete. Chargers were ready to just leave the half down by 11. Nope. 11 points instead of 14. Now thinking about that clock here is Gus Edwards. Stopped just about at the line of scrimmage. Meanwhile, the Chargers, they can't win the close ones to wit. They have lost 11 straight games, 11 in a row, decided by three or fewer points. As they approach this four-minute offense, not much of a run game without J.K. Dobbins. It's high percentage throws. It's rollouts. It's screens. Check it down. Well, you saw Dean Spanos. He's been through a few of these gut-wrenchers before. Herbert. Throw it. Drop. And that's been an issue for Johnston in his two years with the team. He was the number one pick out of TCU last season, third and ten. He's got so much ability, and yet this continues to be a problem. Not only does he not pick up the yardage here, it's soft coverage, take advantage of it, still would have been third down. But more importantly for the Broncos, the clock stops. 343, ton of time. DT for a compliment of timeouts. As we head to the finish, third and ten. That's McConkie. Herbert has to get away. Herbert's going to keep it. Herbert's going to pick up the first down. Does it again with his legs. Chargers won a personal foul at the end of the play for a late hit. Don't see a flag. But Herbert for 16 on a third and ten. and remind people he's got this kempy ankle, this left ankle. Watch what Cooper does on a stunt. Inside move. Now he can get to the edge. Clam man coverage. No one there to spy on him. Maybe not thinking he's a threat because of that ankle. Herbert. Chase. Back across his body and incomplete. Johnson was coming back for it. It'll be second and ten. That is dangerous. It's very dangerous. There's about four guys that could probably get away with doing that and not throw a ball that's intercepted. I mean, think about where you are at your own five-yard line. He has, most of this year, avoided that disastrous play. Did throw a pick last week, has one tonight. Wants to play smart, also aggressive at the same time. Second and ten. It's caught up at the nine-yard line by Junkston. and he cannot spin free from that tackle by Abrams Drane. Third and four. That's a big play for both teams, really. Momentum clearly favoring Greg Roman. He's a play caller and offensive coordinator. Done such a good job tonight with his plan going up against Vance Joseph. Big opportunity for Joseph and his defense to get off the field, get good field position for Bo Nix. Short drop, quick throw caught up at the 19-yard line Hayden Hurst who's been hurt now with a hip injury since week 10 been around for a while seventh year in the league makes the grab here they drop into a zone and it's a good job by Herbert a little bit of a delay and he just finds a soft spot. They've really missed Hurst's ability to make big catches, especially on third downs. And here they're able to locate him between the safety six and a linebacker. Great timing there and a huge first down as far as chewing up the clock here with the Chargers up by three. Herbert has completed 22 passes tonight to 10 different receivers. Hurst just made his first grab. Edwards runs into his own guys. Up to the 20. Short game. Second to nine. Something to think about if you're a fan of these two teams. Denver has been a slow starting team and a great team late in the game. There's the passing distribution. 19 different players tonight. It's time for the most in a game this year with the two teams combined. And the Chargers have been a team that's really struggled in the fourth quarter. They start fast, but they struggle in the fourth quarter. And yet we've kind of seen the reverse tonight for both these teams. Flipped it. in Hollywood. He flipped the strip. Second and nine. Rolling. That's a sidearm. It's knocked down. Jonathan Cooper. Talked about a lot of passes. Since 2020, Herbert has had more passes knocked down and deflected in the line of scrimmage than any other quarterback. And you would think, now at 6'6", that wouldn't be a problem, but he changes that arm angle and does a lot of sidearm so much. Watch the adjustment by zero, Cooper. He goes up and then down. Really almost anticipating that sidearm throw. He gets that arm down. That is a heck of a play by Cooper there on that second down. Halfway through the fourth. Third and nine. Pressure. Look out. Sacked. Seven-yard line. Drew Sanders. First time he called his name tonight. On the physically unable to conform list over the first 12 weeks of the season. Makes his presence very much built. So the offensive line, the center calls. He's going to go to the left. The problem is they need one extra guy to the right. It's a miscue. They walked up six. They created confusion. The center, Bozeman, calls it for the left. As you can see, they got three coming from the right. and just not enough to pick up the pressure. Scott, punting out of his own end zone. Sky-high booth. Bearcats goal for a made by Sims at the 45-yard line. Heading down the stretch of this one. Opening game of Week 16. 27-24, LA. Movie guy? Doesn't sound like it. Every third year. just caught that sight outside the stadium fog rolling in under the translucent roof here at SoFi set up for a great finish we've had a few of them on Thursday night this season a whole bunch in fact Estime is the running back Broncos down by 3 start the drive from the 45 yard line in Kansas City you never know with Mahomes with the ankle if they might rest him, but still, you'd rather take care of business tonight while you have this opportunity and a five-point lead heading into the fourth quarter. I'm sure Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung. Here we go, the fourth quarter on a second and six as the Chargers have the ball at their own 38-yard line. Play action. Rolling. Pressure. Gets it away. There's a flag down. Jonathan Cooper came in. and it's the double this is zero and Clay Martin was right there and they got him with a horse collar there Cooper chasing from behind horse collar tackle defense number zero 15 yards to the lead automatic coach down first time we've seen Cooper have a chance to get some pressure anytime you're chasing from behind and you reach up high, doing everything you can not to get a hold of that jersey and pull that guy down. But that's exactly what he did. That is a big penalty. Instead of a sack or an incompletion, they're across midfield now after that penalty. A big penalty at the end of the half to set up that free kick. Now this one moves the ball to the Denver side of the 50-yard line, the 47-yard line. Five penalties. against Denver tonight only one accepted against the Chargers From the pistol Off the face step enough throws underneath knocked down the line of scrimmage. D.J. Jones through the years, the one thing, Herbert has a lot of passes batted down. Yeah, yeah. I was going to say, we've talked so much about Denver's offensive line. You know, the Broncos, you said earlier, they lead the NFL in sacks. Only one sack tonight. For the most part, he's been pretty clean, and that's been such an emphasis from Greg Roman. It's like, listen, we have one of the best quarterbacks in the league. He needs time, and he needs space. And they've given it to him tonight By dollars the running back Again under pressure gets the pass away as a flag as you see on the far side of the field by Dell tackled there by Cody Barton That was a Second and ten play Charges are for the moment seeming to back up. But no, it's going to be offside. Now he wants to know. Zach Allen has been close. Sometimes you see those offensive tackles, they get away with it. Zach Allen's gotten away with maybe one or two. He has such good get-off. That time just a little bit premature. So that's going to make it a second and five. With the ball to 42-yard line. Fidel. That runs into his own man, Matlock. Denver with good pressure that time, stopping him. Good run. Stoppage at the line, a scrimmage, and we third down and five. Yeah, Sternad has really been what Vance Joseph would tell you, probably one of the big surprises that Greg Roman and his Chargers offense has had to deal with. Vance Joseph's saying, you know, listen, when we lost Singleton, we were terrified. But if you look at this defense and how we've improved, number 40's been a big difference for us. Made a great play there. Haskins comes in as the third down back. Broncos look like they're coming. Eight guys up at the line. Here they come. Pass is thrown and caught. But he flagged his down at the 43-yard line. I just wonder if they lined up in the neutral zone as a defense. They had everybody up there. They did. Catch made by Johnston. Offside. Defense number 92 Lining up in the neutral zone Penalty's decline Think about these mistakes That are costing this Broncos team
