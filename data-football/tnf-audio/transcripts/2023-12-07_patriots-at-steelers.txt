 Two, about 240, but he works very hard with T.J. Watt, another obvious player out of Wisconsin, so in the offseason they train and Herbig has always studied T.J. Watt. It's the first and 20, Elliott makes the grab, cuts to the inside, after the 34 goes Zeke, mentioned as a rookie, led the league in rushing, led the league in rushing in his third year, of course a stellar career, and the night he jumped into the Salvation Army barrel. On a Sunday night game in Dallas. Can't forget it. Big personality. It's great to see him get this opportunity tonight. You know, Bill LeBron, they haven't run the football a lot tonight with Zeke Elliott. Not been able to run it well. 10 carries, 22 yards. But he does have six catches. So they are finding ways to get his hands on the ball. Yeah, 85 yards from scrimmage. Second down and 12. Here he goes again. He went up and over the 2,000 carry mark in his career in the first half. And that'll make it third down at about seven. Just to go back to what Bailey, Zappi, and Trubisky, we talked about this being kind of a theme or an important aspect of this game, is not just playing like Zappi has and making plays, but you getting your own territory, avoiding that turnover. Trubisky threw one, gave the Patriots great field position, ended up catching in for a touchdown. Zappi was in his own in the first half. Let's see what he does here with this opportunity on third down. Zappi's thrown for 220. And three touchdowns. Third and seven. Hanging in, but not for long. Cam Hayward. He's been relatively quiet tonight, but a spectacular career in his 13th season. Adam, Ohio State picked the number one back in 2011. Gets the sack here. For Steelers fans, how great is it to see 97? He's going up against a rookie right guard, City Soa, and just works through him. He's got such great strength with that bull rush. A good coverage downfield frees him up to get home. The rookie, Bryce Barringer. Sends it toward the near sideline and bounces out of bounds near the Pittsburgh bench. And there will spot the ball at the 26-yard line. 5-12 to go in the third, guys. But the options are manifold going into next season. Does he come back to coach the team again next year? There's one way. Meanwhile, Trubisky throws here. Short pass caught by Pickens there. Does another team look to hire him and then a trade is affected? And that's the way he came to New England in a trade with the Jets back in 2000. Does he get fired? I say the chances of that are 0.2%. Does he go into television? You know how crazy that sounds, but he won an Emmy on that Best of 100 show with Chris Collinsworth and Rich Eisen did a fantastic job. Second down and five here. Going to toss back here. I think the only guy that knows is Bill Belichick. Belichick, and I think Robert Craig would have to know. and everybody's staying home. How about this? If he goes into television, they put him in the booth with Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady next year on Fox. There's the answer. Okay? I love it. Or he goes on tour with Jon Bon Jovi. So we have all these possibilities, and nobody knows right now. You're throwing them all out there. Take your pick. Throw him in there with Tommy Brady. That'd be fun. That'd be great. It's like Earl Weaver and Jim Palmer. I had those guys for a bunch of years back in baseball. You're right. He did a great job. He did. when he did that studio show with Chris and Rich. Third down and six. One-handed catch, but short of the first down by plenty. Jonathan Jones makes this up. So, of course, this will be the ongoing saga in New England. Also, you know, Bill in his 70s, so another team that wants him, I mean, it has to be a relatively short-term situation. What does he do? He has to build a new staff, basically. I think the biggest question that he has to answer himself is, does he still have the fire? Does he still wake up and have that competitive fire? Nobody, again, knows that except himself. Fair quote at the 31-yard line by Miles Bryant. So you look at his career accomplishments, and of course, tons of them. 300 regular season wins, 31 postseason wins, six championships, as you know. The Lombardi's 11th straight division titles took over in 2000. He was going to become the head coach of the New York Jets, that famous press conference. Where he left that second is Montgomery. Gets stopped at the 22-yard line, and down we go to Kaylee. Well, Al, both of the Walter Payton nominees featured tonight. They want to empower the next generation. Jones, he was inspired by his 8-year-old daughter Skyler to become the first male ambassador for Play Like a Girl. And his Next Step Foundation is impacting kids in New England and in his home state of Georgia. And because six-time nominee Hayward believes that every kid needs someone rooting for them, his Hayward house is doing just that, fighting childhood hunger, spreading kindness, among other initiatives, guys. Yep, 13 great seasons in the National Football League for number 97. What a player. Yeah, tremendous. After the play was over, personal foul, unnecessary roughness. Doing with number 41. Kenley will reinforce half the distance to the goal. Push down. It's on Brendan Schooler. Well after the whistle. Loses his pool there. and they would have had the ball at the 22. You look at the time, 246, the way your quarterback's playing, you know, you're thinking about getting into field goal range. Maybe they still will, but now they go all the way back to their 11-yard line. Gets an earful from Joe Judge, the special teams coach. He was the head coach of the Giants for a couple of years. So you have 246. Each team has its full complement of timeouts. Start from the 11. Crowd back into it now. Elliott. Decent hold. Closes quickly. Gain of four. Second down and six. Steelers call a timeout here. I think they're sensing it may be a conservative approach. Use their timeouts. Try to get the ball back. See if they can get in field goal range themselves. So week 14. Beginning tonight. They're division leaders. And your wildcard teams of the season ended right now. Steelers, Browns, Colts, and almost everybody else is in the hunt. And look at those teams at 6-6. They used a game back. These next four or five weeks are going to be very exciting. Second down and 6. That's caught for a first down. as Ty Montgomery makes the grab there. He's been around nine years in the league, played good New Orleans last season, first down. Go after Michael Walker again in coverage. Remember Cole Holcomb, Quan Alexander, Roberts with a groin, so they had to bring some others up. They signed Blake Martinez, who had officially retired. I mean, they are beat up at linebacker. Walker's been playing a lot, Mark Robinson. New England knew that that was a potential opportunity, and they've attacked that a lot here in this first half. And that first down enables them to run some time off the clock. After New England had used their first time out. Coming up on the two-minute warning here. Zappy to the outside. And a leaping grab is made there by Thornton. And that takes us to the two-minute warning. 21-10. Patriots leading the Steelers in Pittsburgh on this Thursday night. We're really looking spiffy tonight. Look at this. I mean, I didn't know they had help until a couple weeks ago. No kidding. I know. You and I are just schlepping around here. Yeah, we're going to the Army-Navy surplus store. No problem. Second and seven. That pass is low and juggled and out of bounds incomplete. Intended there for Time Montgomery. Third and seven. One of the few mistakes we've seen from this receiver group. We're focusing a lot on Zappi. But one of the big questions I think a lot of people have had is they've had some injuries on the outside, just haven't been real consistent at receiver. Tonight, it's been a different story. The tight ends, obviously, with Hunter Henry. But the receiver's playing much better tonight to give Zappi some separation and some chances. Let's see what happens here on this third down. Don't get the first down here. And Pittsburgh can use the time. Pittsburgh's looking for that two for one, get the ball, score at the end of the half, and get it to start the second half. Third and seven. Zappi throws, caught, and that's going to be enough for a first down. So Hunter Henry having a big night. Two touchdowns already. That's his third catch of the night. And that forces Pittsburgh into not being able to use timeout. A winner with the right tackle who's really a guard holding up on an island. Often against T.J. Watt here, which is a big surprise. Especially in these two-minute warning, obvious passing situations. He's Watt pinning his ears back, coming after him. Back and scores again. How about this throw by the kid? Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Casey's playing half field. Usually you can't make this throw with the safety sitting back there. But he gives it a little pump fake. He throws it on a line and somehow gets it over 23. Great concentration by the big tight end. but you're not supposed to be able to make that throw with the safety sitting back there ready to jump on that. I thought it might be a pick, but it's a touchdown. Right over the head of KZ. Ryland for the extra point. Halfway through the second quarter. Stunningly, if you're just tuning in. Yep, there are 24 points on the board. Well, Bailey Zappi really stepped up tonight. Give Bill O'Brien a lot of credit. The opening drive, just doing a good job of mixing up the play calls. You're thinking they'd be conservative tonight, right? Let's be careful tonight with Zaffi against his Pittsburgh defense. Uh-uh. Opening drive, they go right down the field for a touchdown. Great throw to Henry. Look at the safety back there. Somehow he's able to get that over top of him. Right now, number four is feeling it for the Patriots in his offense. Where's this been all year? 11 of seven. Well, he's been on the bench most of the year. That's where he's been. 11 of 17 for 168 yards and three touchdowns. Just the execution of it. I mean, he looks great. You can just tell he is feeling it right now. So, I mean, we mentioned it at the start. You get shut out, but you still get another start. Belichick talking about him, saying he doesn't ride the roller coaster. He liked the fact that the emotions were very, very steady. And look what he's done tonight. I mean, take a look at this. I mean, I thought what Jake Browning did the other night. No one expected to see that in Jacksonville. Now here we have another experience with a backup quarterback nobody expected much from. He's stepped up in a big way first half. And Will Leveson, his first start at Tennessee. A few weeks ago, two, four touchdown passes. Touchback here, we go to Kaylee. Guys, at each step in Bailey Zappi's career, he's been doubted. Told he wasn't fast enough or athletic enough. But his college offensive coordinator for four years, Zach Kittley, told me He has never seen Zappi's confidence waver because Zappi believes he can outwork anybody. Zappi said it was a wake-up call when he got cut by the Patriots in camp. And yet, even as he signed with their practice squad the very next day, he told Kitley, trust me, I've got this. Eventually, I'll be the starter. Well, he's not going to lose his job before the end of this game. I know that. Could not have gone any better here. Perfect. Meanwhile, the Steelers down by 18. Flip out here to Warren. And finally they get something. Moss cheer, Bronx cheer. 14-yard gains tackled there by Jalen Mills. I just like to see any time you can get Jalen Warren or in the ball in space. You know, whether he's running an outside zone where he's able to kind of find that outside, stretch it, and then get upfield or this. You've got three blockers in front of him. Receivers do their job, and he doesn't need a lot of room. He's got great sudden and quickness to be able to get upfield. So, nice easy throw. Good blocks up front. Nice positive game. Najee Harris back in. He takes it, and he flips the ball here to Calvin Austin. And Austin gives the crowd something to cheer about as he takes it to the 50-yard line. On a trick play, Isaac Samato leading the way, number 73, first down. Trubisky trying to get involved there, maybe take some of his frustration out. And they're trying to open his playbook up. That's Warren, by the way, in motion. Maybe trying to draw the defense's attention. And they go back the other way. Watch Trubisky appreciate the effort there trying to take out Jabril Peppers. So back-to-back positive first down plays here for this Pittsburgh offense. And what you kind of, you could call this a drive where they have to come away with some points here. Down 21-3. Ball at the 49-yard line. Pressure. Gets it away. Caught. And then taking the ball into Patriot territory. There's Connor Hayward. Pressure that time put on. But he's able to get it away by Kyle Duggar. I think the most frustrating part of this so far is they're not able to control the line of scrimmage and run the football. You know, in the last three weeks, they've been able to do that. Now, it's a bigger challenge, as we said. It's going to be tough to see how they do against one of the best run defenses in the league. But by not being able to get that run game going, they're not getting the safeties down to create the one-on-one opportunities for pickings. Second and five. And fighting his way for what should be a first down. Najee. And is almost intercepted. Could have called Henry again. Could have been his second offensive P.I. Barringer's punt. Field in at the 10 and run back to the 15-yard line by Calvin Austin. A little bit more than two to play in the opening quarter. Acresure Stadium, Pittsburgh, PA, 7-3, New England. We'll be in Vegas as the Raiders meet the Chargers on Thursday night football. Both teams trying to stay alive in that. Hunt charges coming off that shutout win at New England last week. Raiders are also 5-7 on Prime Video. Coming down the home stretch, every single game in these playoff pictures, you know, with the wild card, you look at all the teams that are still mathematically alive. Every game matters. That'll be a good one next week. We're good. We're good. Gang to eight. Gang to eight. Trubisky out of the pistol. A little toss here. Harris. Najee picks up four, gets to the 19-yard line on his fourth carry of the night. Jennings making the tackle. This defense has done it all year. In fact, what's crazy is one in three when allowing ten or fewer points this year. They've had three in a row. The rest of the entire NFL is 53-0 when they allow ten points or fewer. This Patriots defense sits there looking at it. One in three. Trubisky on a second and six. Open man. Picking up the first down. Jalen Warren. Crowd likes it. They have fallen a little bit in love with Jalen Warren out of Oklahoma State. Undrafted free agent last year. Yeah, he does a good job catching them all out of the backfield. He's really proven this year to be that great complement to Najee Harris. Najee's 242 pounds, runs north and south, runs through people, downhill. Warren gets out in space and makes people miss. In fact, he was one of the best in the entire NFL at making defenders miss. Harris in there now, but Warren stays in. He's the motion man. and Najee can barely get out of the backfield on first down. Jalen Mills making the tackle. Patriots just keep filing guys in, safeties, linebackers, just interchangeable parts that do so many different parts of this defense. Pepper, sometimes he's a safety, sometimes he's a linebacker. Duggar, same thing. That time it was Mills off the edge. Makes it really hard on an offensive line quarterback to ID what the role is of these players because they can do so many different parts of this defense. Been a Belichick trademark for a quarter century. Keep them guessing. Second and 11. Trubisky avoids an ankle tackle, but then slips as he gets to the 27-yard line, and that's going to take us to the end of the quarter. So we played 15 minutes in Pittsburgh, 7-3. Belichick coaching up the offense for Zappi and Elliott. Checking out the screen. Right now they're on defense as we begin the second frame. Pittsburgh with a third down and 10 at their own 27-yard line. And they'll go five wide here. They go Mike Hayne here. Mike flex, Mike flex. Now Warren comes into the backfield. Trubisky under pressure fires, lovely pass and that's intercepted inside the 40 to grilled peppers down the sideline and will set up a first down at about the 11 yard line and the boos rain down from the stealer faithful now this textbook on what New England's plan was tonight against Trubisky this is the book on him Show him a pre-snap look and then move at the snap of the football. Watch all the movement from the time the ball is snapped. Duggar ends up coming on the blitz. But watch the linebackers sink, and now they drop back into coverage. The safety was up close to the line of scrimmage. He drops back, and then he's able to step in. Peppers baited him the entire defense. Steve Belichick dials it up perfectly. Get him to third down in an obvious passing situation. They bring pressure from his right. They drop from the left, and that's been his Achilles heel, identifying that and avoiding that disastrous play that we talked about earlier. So the Pats at the 11-yard line. Wilson makes a stop, third down and eight. And his play's right into New England's hands again. So far, the Steelers are 0 for 3 on third downs. They keep them in this third and eight. This is where they wanted to. Remember, the last time it was third down, showed them one look in the pre-snap, Moved, throws the interception. Let's see what they dial up here on this defense here on this third down and long. Seals have run 16 plays to 38 yards. On third and eight, Trubisky throws, and that's almost fit. And, of course, that will bring a torrent of boos. Alex Lawson is there. Well, you saw the three quarterbacks. We showed you Pickett's hurt. We showed you Trubisky. They want Mason Rudolph. And by the way, Ben Roethlisberger's in the building. He's always spent some time with him before the game. We said hello to him earlier. Ball's behind him. This is a rookie out on an island on third down. Ball's late and behind him. And here comes the chance again. Here's Harvin's kick. Fair catch pulled for me. 29-yard line by Miles Bryant. 12.45 to go in the half. He gets picked in the fourth round. but his friends were pranking him, prank calling him. And now all of a sudden he gets another call. He's not sure who it is, but he picks the phone up and it's a scout from the Patriots. He starts his drive from the 28-yard line. And Elliott falls down. And so he gets the call from the scout. The scout says, here's Bill Belichick. Belichick says, hey, we're drafting you next. Here's Bob Kraft. So much for a welcome to the ball club. There you go. You're next. But he did. He thought, what's going on here? One of my friends pranking me. I'm sure after Bill Belichick hopped on there, he knew no one's doing this for us. Right. With the Steelers offense playing the way it is, it's time for the Steelers defense to assert themselves and make some plays. Hit this guy behind the sticks. Zappy throws. That's dropped up at the 30-yard line. Zeke Elliott couldn't pull that in. Zeke a busy man tonight. He's already carried six times for only nine yards. He's caught three for 32, third and 11. Yeah, we've seen all these backup quarterbacks in the last week. Jake Browning had a big game for Cincinnati. Gardner Minshew for Indianapolis. Zappi now off to a good start. I mean, that is a big theme this year in the NFL, these high-profile quarterbacks going down. And a lot of times that backup not ready to answer the bell. Zappi tonight doing that. Third and 11. Shoulder shake. Flips it out here to Elliott. Nice move. Zeke looking for that first down, but he'll come up short about three yards in front of that Steeler bench. So it's fourth down. And I have absolutely no problem at all. That is a great play by Bailey Zappi. He went through about three or four different progressions. Everybody's covered. They played a zone. So instead of forcing the ball, that's been a problem with Mac Jones. They try to make a play, and it ends up being a turnover on third down. He just checks it down and almost gave Zeke a chance to pick up that first down, and he punted away. No problem. Bryce Barringer's third punt of the night, and that one will skid into the end zone. Time now for the high-performance 4K Sky Can. presented by BMW. This Patriots defense has been doing a lot of damage in this early part of this game, whether it's been defending the run. Here's Jennings setting that edge against Jalen Warren. Peppers disguising a part of that defense, disguising and then recognizing that ball in the air, capitalizes, steps in front of it. Gives his own offense really good field position. They were able to put another touchdown on the board. The Patriots have looked at me. This looks like a different team, obviously, than the team that's played all year and especially the team that played last week Well, they didn't get anything on the board. Over the last three weeks. Yep. In single digits each week. Already 14 on the board tonight. From the 20-yard line, Jalen Warren. Flanking Trubisky in the backfield. Trubisky rolling. Keeping. Down he goes after a gain of three. I think we came in tonight knowing that it's going to be tough on Trubisky, but especially considering that Jalen Warren and Najee Harris have been a non-factor so far in running the football. Harris has six yards on six carries. Warren negative two yards. Number 76 is an eligible receiver. It's obviously easy to point to Trubisky in his passing game, but they need more from this offensive line in this running game to take some of the pressure off of what... Look out. Sacked. 31-yard line. Landon Roberts. Haven't called his name tonight. But Roberts comes in, makes the sack. Played in three Super Bowls, Landon did with New England. And now Pittsburgh can take a timeout. This is well designed. These two set a pick right here. And then Roberts works around that pick. Nice job of being patient. Works around it. New England doesn't communicate. And again, one of the first times we've seen Zappi with serious pressure. This line, for the most part, has done a heck of a job taking care of it. Ten-yard sack, second down and close. Flexing of the right arm, right elbow. So he paid a price here. Check it out here on second down and 20. Steelers have one timeout remaining. Going to keep it on the ground. Going to make Pittsburgh use that final timeout. Fitzpatrick takes Elliott down. Third down and 21. Back in 30 seconds. And a whistle here. Now you've got a blood spot on Zappi's right elbow. So Clay Martin comes in. And he's going to. Thought for the moment to take him out, but no. Going to reset that play clock. 25 seconds I'm assuming he'll just run the ball Take all the time off the clock and leave Pittsburgh With nothing instead of, you know, trying to go for 21 yards here Yeah, I think that's why they ran the ball in the last play To set up this run right here Exactly, real simple Belichick pretty good at working the clock For all these years Don't leave it up to him He's only been coaching 49 years In the National Football League Started as a low-level assistant to Ted Marcher-Roder back in Detroit in the 70s. And then Marcher-Roder succeeded him when Cleveland moved to Baltimore back in 96. Interesting trail with Bill. We'll get into it in the second half. What the future might or might not hold for him. Meanwhile, they'll run that clock all the way down and leave Pittsburgh with almost no time at all as Barron Jewel gets set to send it skyward for the fourth time in the game. And they'll use all of the clock. Five yards hardly mattering here. Timeout by New England was called prior to any movement on the line. It's a 30-second timeout. Okay. Yeah, of course, one of the stories has been, Bill Belichick, I mentioned, it's an everyday story. It's not only the story du jour, but every day. And we'll talk about it in the second half. There's a lot of things going on, a lot of possibilities, and a ton of speculation. Yeah, I think any time you have a Hall of Fame career, the best coach to ever coach, and a couple years ago, the way they have, people are going to start to speculate. I think he gets asked all the time, is this it? Is this it? And he says, well, I'm on to Pittsburgh. Yeah, absolutely, as he said last week. That's Calvin Austin. with Bill it's always about next week don't forget in 2014 they looked terrible on a Monday night game in Kansas City and then all of a sudden it looks like the new guy, Jimmy Garoppolo is about ready to take over for Tom Brady so we did the Sunday night game Collinsworth and I, we go to Foxborough all the papers are talking about it's Garoppolo's time, right? Brady's finished in 2014 they win the game, they kill him and what happens at the end of the year Brady wins the Super Bowl. That's what I think. The automatic assumption that it's time to move on, I don't think that's always just the easy answer. You know, I think a lot of times they've tried to do that with him. Now, Tom Brady's not here, so it's a totally different story. Really? What I'm just saying. I mean, it's a different set of circumstances, obviously, but we'll get into that more, I guess, in a second half. I didn't realize he left. I think it's pretty obvious. Yeah. End of the half, 21-10. State Farm halftime show coming up after this break. Fabled coaching, certainly on Belichick's side. First ballot Hall of Famer, unanimous. He will be. Neewon Tomlin, 16 years in the league. Bouncing ball is taken to the two-yard line. He will be looking for room. Touched it back. Brings it up to the 17-yard line. It'll start from there. They finally found a rhythm offensively at the end of that first half. They ran a screen to Jalen Warren. They got a reverse with a Trubisky block. He plays with every single down, every single week. Zappi retreats. Zappi throws downfield into double coverage, and that one is incomplete. Intended there for Taequann Thornton. We go to Kaylee. Well, guys, while Pittsburgh's defense was on the sidelines, T.J. Watt was attended to. An athletic trainer wiped blood from his chin. And then a doctor actually reached inside his mouth and evaluated that jaw joint. This is something where symptoms could further develop, but no other attention was paid to him after that. Yeah, you can see him going through that right there on the bench. The number 90, like the postman, either rain or snow or gloom at night. He's going to keep him from his appointed rounds. Speaking of the weather, it's 45 degrees and clear. Very nice. Through the middle. Gain of a couple. Zeke Elliott. Picks a three, third down and seven. Yeah, T.J. Watt's been just challenged throughout his career. What I love is he's able to defend the run. It's not just about being a great pass rusher. It's just a disruptor. And I think he takes a lot of pride in being a complete player. He works at his game 12 months out of the year. And I think we all get excited about these kind of opportunities on third down But if you really study them it an every down thing for number 90 Six minutes left in the opening quarter Third down and seven Zappi, downfield. That's going to be caught outside the 40-yard line. Then a flag comes in at the end of the play. Hunter Henry, the tight end. Steel is indicating it's against the Patriots, and the Patriots are walking back. Offense number 85. so that's how Hunter got free yeah at the top of the route he pushes off that's what freed him up from Trenton Thompson I was about to talk about Zappi sitting in there on a third and long wide on a twist but to push right there good call by the official that's how he did end up separating and getting open so Henry comes out on a third down and 17 Belichick arguing the call have to get to the 35 throw underneath elliott's got a blocker and it closes quickly on him at the 27 yard line minka fitzpatrick is right there and the patriots send in the punt unit and if you're a patriots fan that's the thing that i think has bothered you the most this year the miscues it's not necessarily always the execution the red zone's been a problem and then the turnovers the interceptions, and the penalties that get you behind the sticks right there. Bryce Barringer, a rookie out of Michigan State. He's the punter, Calvin Austin. Back to accept it in his 25-yard line. And backing up a little bit. Austin hauls it in at the 17. And nowhere to roam. Stopped at the 21-yard line. and that's where Trubisky and company will take over with 4-4 to the Blue Medical Tent. So we'll get a report on that. Kaylee's down there and she'll check that out for us. Meanwhile, in terms of injuries, there's Kenny Pickett, who underwent wrist surgery. So he's in a box tonight. He's out for two to four weeks. The Steelers have a question that they need to have answered, and I don't think it's been answered yet this season. Is he the future? He had ankle surgery this week is what he had. Anyway, we'll report on that when we come back. Is he the guy for the future? We have to wait and see. But still a lot of questions to be answered. Trubisky back to pass throws, and that is dropped up at the 26-yard line. So, Kaylee, what do you know about the Pickett injury? Well, guys, less than 24 hours after Pickett limped off this field with a sprained right ankle on Sunday, he was in surgery on Monday. It was a cutting-edge Arthrex tightrope procedure. Holes are drilled into the two bones of the lower leg, then extremely strong sutures are looped through, and that pulls the bones together, realigning and stabilizing the injured lower shin. Pickett actually had this same procedure done on his left ankle in 2020 in college, and he returned to play 26 days later. Thank you, Dr. Hartung. You're getting very good at those animations. Second down and 10. Here's Harris. So, you know, I started to talk about, Kirk, the fact that they'd like to know if he's the guy for the future. They picked him in the first round last year. Off and on this year, you know, nothing great. You're looking ahead to next year. What do you think? I think that's the big decision they're going to have to make. Second year out of Pitt. Matt Canada, you know, obviously took a lot of the blame for the offensive struggles. And I think now you can pick it, be the guy. They have a lot of weapons when you look at the receivers. Harris. By the way, Connor Hayward made that last catch. Brother came, of course, played on the other side. They're going to mark it a little bit short for Harris. They're going to come up. No huddle here. On third and inches. And a non-push push. We'll get the first down from Mitch Trubisky. We're not in Philly. We're definitely not in Philly. We're across the state. Under five now to play in the opening half. Trubisky's only throwing ten times, 36 yards plus the pick. Harris doing next to nothing on the ground. Pickens has caught one. It's okie-okie. Mike's 48. Mike's 48. Team 8. Mike's 28. Warren. Through the 35-yard line. Jelani Tavai makes the stop there. One of the indicators that teams have, I think, study receivers and how they come off the line on a run versus a pass. Here's George Pickens on a run this last play. He's kind of taken the play off, you know, And I think that sends a message to me, to your team. I look at receivers when it comes to their willingness to block and the effort that they're willing to put forth. It kind of represents the pulse of the team. Bad look at this Pittsburgh offense. Perfect point. Second down and five. That pass is low and incomplete, but a flag is thrown. Try to get it in there to Friar. Mooth covered there by Kyle Duggar. So what's second down and five? And a little conference here amongst four officials. Now down to three. And awaiting the call from Clay Martin. Pass interference. Defense number 23. It's a spot foul. Automatic first down. I think Friar Muth in the middle of this offense we have Deontay Johnson on the outside Pickens who can get downfield stretch a defense and opens up the middle we saw that two weeks ago when they went to Cincinnati in the first game that Mike Sullivan called they got him the ball with the safety splitting he was able to work down the middle of those seams I'm sure that's something they want to at some point try to get to again tonight he's a great weapon It reminds me a lot of a younger Mark Andrews in Baltimore with his body and his versatility and what he can do. Warren. It's stacked up after picking up about four. Juwan Bentley, the first guy to hit him there. They picked up four first downs on this drive. Started back at their own 25. It's consumed more than four minutes. You're right. It's so important, I think, for this team to get on the board before the half. Yeah, you talked about Mike Tomlin feeling this is a redemption week and what they need to do. I think this is a redemption drive down 21-3. They have to come away with some points, get themselves to believe. Remember, they did the first. They get the ball in the second half. They've got to get themselves to believe that they can come back in this game. So Hayward and Watt, the defense on that sideline. Second down and six. Here comes the blitz from the outside. They pick it up. The pass is going to be caught in the end zone by Johnson. Touchdown. 25 yards. Duggar was blitzing. They picked him up. Gave Trubisky the time to send it toward the end zone for their first touchdown of the night. It's a good job by the protection. You mentioned Najee Harris and also Trubisky. He feels this pressure right here. Najee Harris comes over and picks it up. But Trubisky knows it's there. Watch him move in the pocket, help Najee Harris out, and then puts that over that outside shoulder of Deontay Johnson and make that play over top of J.C. Jackson for the touchdown. So they answered the call. They needed the points, and they got them. And if you like the over, they've also answered the call. Chris Boswell with the extra point with 2.50 to go in the first half. 21-10 New England. Points in this game. Not AWS. They didn't weigh in on us. Friendly local bookmaker. Or unfriendly ones. Kaylee will be next. We'll get a report from her. Step up into the pocket. He climbs right here. And then really does a good job of putting Levi Wallace in a tough spot. Because he's either going to stop the quarterback and give up the throw. Or sit in coverage. and then let Zappi use that athletic ability to pick up the first down. Got 11 on the third down and nine. Ball at the 14. Elliott again. Showing some shiftiness. Two-time rushing champion, Cam Hayward, making the stop there. Second down. With Ramondre Stevenson down, you know, he's such a talented back. He goes down with that high ankle. He opens the door for Zeke Kelly. And talking to Bill O'Brien this week, he said, you know, at this stage of his career, yeah, maybe he's down a step or two. But, you know, eighth year, really works hard during practice, has a great attitude. We've been really impressed with what he has brought. So they're looking forward to giving him an opportunity to showcase, see what he can do tonight. Patriots in foreign territory. They didn't even get inside the Chargers 30 last week. Floats a pass here to Zeke. Dives. Touchdown. I mean, go figure. They played 60 minutes at home last week. Don't score. Don't come close to scoring. And just like that, off the bat, 75 yards and eight plays to take the lead. And with the injuries the Steelers have had at linebacker, one of the big questions would be how would these backup linebackers do against tight ends and do against the running backs? Here's Zeke Elliott, a little pick there to slow down the linebacker, trying to get out in coverage. Walker, it allows a nice, easy read and throw for Zappi, and just like that, man, Patriots look great on this opening drive. Chad Ryland, fourth-round pick out of Maryland. The rookie hoops that one through. And so that one took only three minutes and 48 seconds. And a stunning beginning for the New England Patriots, who it figures to be a very low-scoring game, as you know. 7-0. Kane Lane, starring Eddie Murphy, and other favorites. One app, one password. Find your holiday happy place, they say, on Prime Video. Meanwhile, they still work on Watt, who took a shot and came back into the game. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh to get the ball, and Godwin Iquibuque will take this one back. Breaks a tackle at the 20 and gets spun down at the 31-yard line by Jonathan Jones. So now Mitch Trubisky comes in. No stranger to starting. Of course, he was with Chicago starting in 17. Number two overall pick in the draft. It traded from three to two to get him. And, of course, he was going to be the next Sid Luckman, something Chicago's been looking for since about the 17th century. Had a good rookie year, had a very good second year, and then all of a sudden, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And now he went with the Buffalo to back up Allen for a year, and now here last year. Najee Harris is the running back. Play action. Good protection. Now he has to scramble it. He can run, and Trubisky will pick up the first down on his first play of the game. Kind of an overlooked part of his game, the fact that he is a decent runner. He really is. He brings that element, and when coverage is good the way it was on this play, those linebackers sink back in coverage. He makes a really good decision to just pull it down and use his feet. Picked up nice positive yards for that first down. For him, he's going to play well, but can he avoid that critical mistake? Putting the ball into coverage, especially in a game like this, that it appears you'd think could be low scoring. After a 15-yard gain, they give it to the running back, Harris, who gets out to the 47-yard line. Devon Dockjaw making the tackle there after a gain of two yards. I think a big question coming in tonight for Mitch is, can this running game get the yards that they need to get against this defense? You know, the Patriots, one thing that gets lost on their season is how well they have played on that side of the football. And they are tough to run the ball. In fact, 3.2 yards a carry, that's the best in the NFL. So for a Pittsburgh team that wants to establish the run, This will be a tough thing to do tonight against the Patriots. Overall, they're rushing defense, fourth in the league. Kirk just mentioned, very low average game. So they rely on that front. They rely on the linebackers at second down and nine. Through the middle, getting to the 50-yard line and stop there. Here's Najee Harris again. They make a third down and let's call it a six. This defense is derived with those defensive linemen to eat up those blocks, free up those linebackers like Jawan Bentley and Tavai to be able to get downhill. And that's what they did on those last two plays. This is what Najee Harris brings to this offense is that physicality has been more explosive this year. He's 11 runs over 15 yards or more. And in 21 and 22 had 16. So he's definitely been able to stretch things out. But that time it was all about just being physical and breaking those tackles. Nine carries for him, 23 yards. Warren back in there. Flip it to Warren. And Warren takes it across the 50 to the 46-yard line of the Patriots. Miles Bryant makes the tackle. First down, Steelers. So again, much like we saw at the end of the first half on that drive that led to a touchdown, some reverse, a couple reverses, one in the earlier drive, one here, some screens, getting the ball to Warren out in space. Almost got ahead of his lineman, but put the brakes on and let them get out in front of him. Hey, Mike is eight. Mike is eight. It's punk. Eight to eight. Mike, 20%. Warren. Stacked up. Lawrence Guy is right there. The guy in his 13th year in the league. Second and long. It's another guy that you just don't think much of. But these defensive linemen, usually you think about these guys at a 3-4. They're just going to eat up these linemen. But look how he uses his hands and gets off the blocks. That's a thing of beauty. Usually big defensive linemen, they're just trying to keep those linebackers free. But rotating in, staying fresh, good depth up front. Came over from Baltimore. Six years ago, 13th season in the league for Lawrence Guy. Second down and eight. That pass dangerous and incomplete. Miles Bryant was there. Over the top of Allen Robinson to knock it down. Third down at eight now. I feel like Miles Bryant was in the offensive huddle on this. The fourth-year player out of Washington. He's to our right in the slot, and he just jumps this. He jumped that before the ball even got out. He's just simply reading Allen Robinson. Doesn't feel any threat at all downfield. Allen Robinson is either blocking or everything's underneath. That's why it gives him the cushion. But great quick reaction allows him to get in there and separate that football. Send an extra man. And then get him sacked back at the 49-yard line. Bryant and Duggar both coming in. They blocked Duggar out of what was the touchdown pass before. Not this time. Fourth down. Again, they're mixing up their looks, mostly on these third down plays, confuse him, take away his primary off to the left. He just doesn't have an answer. You could see how uncomfortable he was with his eyes. Once he came off his primary read that was taken away, eyes went down, no answers. Harvin to boot it. Going to let it go and going to bounce into the end zone. on a 44 degree Thursday night. Win not a factor. Zappi throws. It's caught. Elliott breaks a tackle in the backfield. And Zeke having a nice night with a 16-yard gain out to the 36-yard line. Again, Ramondre Stevenson is their number one back, but he's hurt. He's out at least tonight, and we'll see about whether he plays again in their next game in 10 days. And meanwhile, Zeke Showing a lot of what he showed in Dallas. And now you've got Keanu Benton, the rookie out of Wisconsin, who's been a force of late, who's down on the grass. So with the Steelers, Watts been in and out. Highsmith out. And now you've got Benton down. How important it is for him to show some maturity and just kind of keep fighting and being a part of what this offense is trying to do. Everybody's frustrated, but you've got to fight through it. Pickens the nice court. One target, four yards. Period. Drive starts from the 36. Zappy throws. Knocked down. And a flag down. They're going to give McDermott that left tackle holding on Nate Herbig. Holding. Offense number 75. Ten-yard penalty. Free play first down. Trent Brown is the number one guy that missed three games this year. Herbig has a big role tonight with Alex Highsmith out for the rest of the game. The rookie out of Wisconsin has great twitch. Bit of a tweener coming out. He's sixing the ones to do. Let's put Trubisky in these third and obvious situations and then Bill Belichick and his defensive staff can give the looks that they want to give to try to confuse Trubisky to see if he'll throw it into coverage. That's Jalen Warren coming in to flank Trubisky on the third down and six. Four-man rush. Trubisky dancing in the pocket. Fires. Intercepted at the 39-yard line. J.C. Jackson with a flag down. And Jackson, who left, went to the Chargers, came back. Trubisky is saying it's going to be a hold on New England, and that appears to be the call. Clay Martin is the referee. Now J.C. Jackson actually grabs his waist on the round. That's how he caught up to be able to make the interception. Pickens was getting away from him, so he tried to pull a veteran move and see if he could get away with it. It's right in the middle. You see, nice job of crossing over, trying to make this defense have to communicate, and right there he grabs on. Ball has been moved to the 39-yard line. It's on the 39-yard line first down. So that's an 11-yard penalty. Our first flag of the night. Coming off last week. That's a treat. Six minutes into the game. Trubisky to the outside. Caught. and then spun out of bounds at that spot is George Pickens, Jonathan Jones, covering on the play. Of course, it's the third game that they've made this move with Matt Canada being let go in the middle of the year. Eddie Faulkner takes over as the interim OC on the left, and on the right is Mike Sullivan, who is actually calling the plays. Number 76 is an eligible receiver. He called the plays when he was with the New York Giants back in 16 and 17, so the experience as a play caller puts him in the middle just to try to run a clean operation. 1-20! Are we good here? Alert, alert, alert, alert! My thing, my thing! Robinson sets up on the right side. Toss here. One. Nothing. Anthony Jennings is right there to stop him in his tracks instead of a third down and nine. And now with Judon going down, not just a pass rushing ability, but what he does against the run. Jennings went from being a role player to a featured player. This is against Washington, a rookie. Look how he just uses those hands and throws him. So Jennings is a guy that sets the edge. He can provide some pass rush. And I think he's really excelling in his fourth year out of Alabama, showing what he can do, getting an opportunity to play every down. Yeah, you mentioned Judon is probably their best defensive player. Torn biceps week four. Gone for the season. Third and eight. Low snap. Handles it. Going to take off but go nowhere. Stopped at the line of scrimmage. Tackle made there by Mack Wilson Sr. Remember the first play of the game. He stepped up and picked up yards. This time Mack Wilson almost anticipating the potential threat. Even though he rushed off the edge, to me, he's almost used as a spy. Watch how he rushes. Eyes on the quarterback. Now I'm going to get down underneath with the potential threat of him stepping in. almost baited him to step up and then came up with that play. That means Chris Boswell, ninth year with the Steelers, signed as a free agent out of Rice back in 2015. 56-yard attempt, and Boswell bangs that one through. 6.39 to go in the opening quarter in Pittsburgh. New England 7, Pittsburgh 3. K.J. Watt, a rough opening salvo, but he did come back in to play later. Yeah, first play of the game. Look at that knee to the face. I mean, that's a lot of impact that he endures. Then later he takes the back of the foot, the heel there from Zeke Elliott, hits him in the face. I mean, talk about a rough first drive there. Not only seven points, but your star player gets some shots there. Milestone night for him playing in his 100th game. TJ Watt threw 100 games. Mike Tomlin calling him the best defensive player on the planet. So through the games to this point in his career, 91.5 sacks. He covered 10 fumbles. He has 7 picks. And he's in a group of only 3. Jared Allen and another fellow by the name of JJ Watt would be the other guys, his brother. I think what you really appreciate him. He even says his days at Wisconsin, just a passion and energy. Chance to extend their lead. Elliott. You know, we almost gave Trubisky the kibosh. I mentioned he had never thrown a pick six in 1,819 career passes. At least Peppers got tackled at the 11-yard line to save him. No doubt. It looks like Highsmith is going to be down. We saw Watt dealing with some injuries earlier. He's been able to come back, and now the other side is Alex Highsmith. And keep in mind, Marcus Golden is not up tonight, so you have Nate Herbig behind both of these outside linebackers. Mike Tomlin coming out to take a first-hand look. So there was Elliott Highsmith right there on the bottom, and an injury timeout. your sixth year and they're about ready to see him come in again but not at the moment second down and seven Patriots Zappi to the end zone is going to be hauled in for the touchdown by Hunter Henry so the Patriots blanked last week Blank twice at home this year, living in single-digit territory. They put up a couple of touchdowns tonight. Very different-looking offense, obviously, tonight. Much more aggressive. Bailey Zappi looks huge. The interception by Peppers sets them up. Here's the defender right here. We keep talking about the linebackers. This is Michael Walker, who ends up slipping at the top of that route, and they throw right in the middle of this defense. That's where you thought they would attack against these linebackers between the safeties, and they hit one for a touchdown. Ryland for the point after. And two seconds into the second quarter. The Patriots, 2-10, lead the Steelers 7-5, 14-3. Henry was close to making some big plays, and this time capitalizes in the red zone. And let's look at this defensive alert that Amazon likes to look at. The red circles show you the potential threat. Peppers is up at the top. Snap of the ball. You see the movement. And that's where they wanted to challenge Trubisky is to see it from the pre-snap where he starts to think he has an idea where to go with the ball. And then you move and affect his vision. That time Peppers is the beneficiary. Gets the ball back to Bailey Zappi. And a big touchdown throw up high in the air with a tight end can come down with it. And Zappi is off to a great start with his Patriots offense. We were talking to him on the call the other day, and we said, you know, who's your support system? I mean, you know, it's tough. You know, New England and all that, and his fiancée. We'll call her, and I'll say, does she say do your job? Oh, yeah. I love that. Exactly. She's not patting him on the back. Don't worry what you're saying out there. She's saying, hey, hey, do your job. Do your job. the Belichick mantra almost all of his career. She was an athlete herself, so you can't cry on her shoulder. The Patriots have scored 13 total points in their last three games. Have exceeded that tonight. In a little bit more than 15 minutes. Injury report. Kaylee. Guys, we've seen both of the Steelers outside linebackers into the blue tent tonight. Alex Highsmith is still in there. We are told he is questionable to return because of a neck injury. The unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant is inside the tent with him right now. And it was earlier that we saw T.J. Watt in there, also with the UNC for four minutes. But he's been back in the game, and his helmet now has a tinted visor attached to it. Oh, wow. So there he was on the bench. Check it out when they were on defense. Meanwhile, they start from the 25-yard line. Trubisky a little toss here That's going to be a five yard loss Harris takes the flip Jennings makes the tackle And the crowd Is not happy That's a A mismatch on the edge We've talked about Jennings and how physical he is Watch the tight end across from him The rookie Darnell Washington He goes outside and then Jennings shoots Inside just had no chance So it's a miscommunication on the edge there between the tight ends. My guess is Washington ends up needing to come down there to keep him away from that penetration. Trubisky throws. Caught. And that is Friar Muth. A single pin with a, at least go Heath Miller all of those years. Now it's Friar Muth. The tight end, the running backs. All you need is consistency from that quarterback position, and this offense could be up to the level you expect it to be. Third and six. Trubisky going deep downfield. Two deep and incomplete. Defended there for Allen Robinson. So quickly, three and out. And I think that's what they're going to have to figure out in the offseason as they approach it is, can he pick it once he's healthy? Is he the guy that can give you the consistency that this offense needs? Only they know that decision. And when you flip it around, I mean, with New England, it's almost the same thing with Mac Jones. Even though Jones has been in the league a year longer, you know, what's going to happen in their future at quarterback? Yeah, that's a big one. And I don't think they have the weapons around that position the way Pittsburgh does right now. Fair catch call for me by Myles Bryant off the foot of Presley Harvin. So a little bit more about Zappi. He was a nothing, no-star recruit, meaning they didn't think that much of him. Attended Houston Baptist University for three years. But then he transferred to Western Kentucky with one of his coaches who went up there. Set the all-time single-season FBS record in passing yardage, almost 6,062 TDs. He's got picked in the fourth round of last year's draft and making his fourth career start tonight. Yeah, has no problem being able to evaluate coverage, make throws. I think it's more of just being decisive tonight. With a lot of quarterbacks who have had a lot of games under their belt, it's a lot easier to do that. Process the information with a young guy like this. They're trying to simplify to get it out quick. Watt is out of the lineup right now. The catch is made, and close to a first down goes Taequann Thornton, second-year receiver out of Baylor. I think what they're trying to do, Bill O'Brien trying to go back to that first possession where they just went right down the field. A lot of the throws were on early downs. They got him into a rhythm. And, you know, in fact, that was their first touchdown in an opening drive of the entire season. And they executed perfectly. Watt out of the tent. Looking like he's ready to come back in. After the first down from the 38-yard line. Play action. Escapes the sack. Fires. and that is going to be holed in at the 46 line by Juju Smith Alex Highsmith put the pressure on Zappi that time who able to get away and find his man And there Highsmith and here Connor McDermott who going to try to deal with that speed Great get-off, but look at him climb. He just felt that pressure, and that's what I'm talking about. Ability to keep his vision downfield despite all of that noise around him. That's the experience, and that's what he showed when he was at Western Kentucky for that one year. The ability to throw the football downfield. So Watt out, Highsmith applies the pressure, and McDermott does just enough there to be able to allow him to step up. McDermott starting in place with Trent Brown, who is active tonight, but McDermott gets the start. Meanwhile, Zappi moving away and then throws that one out of bounds. Elliott was the intended receiver, but just throwing it away to avoid the sack. Second down and ten. Now, doesn't this game feel like with these quarterbacks, it's one thing to be efficient and try to execute. With these defenses and their potential to create turnovers, which guy is going to avoid that critical error, a pick six or a sack and a fumble? It's not just about being efficient and moving the ball. Just avoid that play that costs you the game because both these offenses want to get a short field. Trubisky, I think, has spent his entire career avoiding a pick six. That's right. Watt is back in there now. That pass is incomplete. Threw it a little bit behind Jalen Rager, a one-time number one pick by Philadelphia. Couldn't haul it in third down and ten. Just a little thing, right? But when Tom Brady do this a million times, you just kind of forget about it to nice completion. Just missing that by six inches or a foot behind the receiver is the difference between a catch and yards after a catch and an incompletion and now a third and ten. 2.20 to go in the quarter. Pat scored on their opening drive. Lead 7-3. Zappi stepping up, fires, and that is incomplete. Almost picked. Tending for Smith-Schuster. You've got Joey Porter Jr. covering on the play. The rookie out of Penn State having a great year. Fourth down. When he stepped up to throw this ball, I really thought he was throwing the ball to Henry, 85, because he gets away again with a potential push-off here at the top of his route. And I really thought they would throw to him. Watch Henry push off. He's right there. Ball goes over his head. From a box upstairs, Bill Belichick has been the coach of the Patriots since 2000. Mike Tomlin took over for Bill Cowher in 2007. So the two long-tenured coaches meeting for the 13th time, counting postseason games tonight, with Belichick winning nine and Tomlin three. Steelers defer. They won the toss. Boswell to kickoff. Time Montgomery is back to receive it. And a touchback begins things with Bailey Zappi leading his offense out to the 25-yard line. So Zappi took over for Mac Jones last week. And not too often does a guy get shut out and wind up with another start. But here we are, the second week in a row for him. And that's where we are in 2023 with the Patriots. They're just looking for some consistency and efficient play right now from that quarterback position. Let's see if Bailey Zappi can do that. Long-time Cowboy Zeke Elliott is now the primary running back. With Armandre Stevenson hurt last week, inactive tonight. They give it to Zeke, and he goes nowhere. Minka Fitzpatrick, who himself was missing several games, and you've got an injured player. That's T.J. Watt. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. who got hurt last week. So on the very first play of the game. I think he just took a big knee. Took a blow from Zeke Elliott. Once he went down, he gets hit by Micah. Then watch him follow through with that knee right into the chest area of T.J. Watt. Let's see where it hits him. Maybe even, yeah, into the face actually. All his momentum. He's a big man at 235 pounds coming through there. So he goes to the sideline, does Watt. That means Nick Herbig, number 51, will come in for at least one play. As Elliott got stuffed at the line. Second down, 10. Zappi's first pass, a floater, it's caught. And that's Elliott with a nice move. And Zeke picking up the first down. Again, Elliott was picked up in the offseason. They picked him up at the beginning of the year. Dallas let him go. Tony Pollard took over there. Ramondre Stevenson has been the number one back, but right now, until Stevenson comes back, it's going to be Zeke. And a really good design there by Bill O'Brien. He used the formation there, went to the strength to the left, and comes back and right as Herbig comes in for T.J. Watt. He tests him instead of as a pass rusher, as a defender out in the flat. Zappy in the pocket. Zappy deep downfield. and that is pulled in by Juju Smith-Schuster, the former Steeler who comes home and a big gainer there on a first down for 37 yards. Covered well, but the pass was right there and he brings it in. Yeah, Casey with tight coverage never locates the football. What an effort here by Juju Smith-Schuster to come back to the football and show his strength. That's what he's been known for throughout his career. Strong hands, somehow holds on to that football for a big gain. Watt comes back in. Schuster last year with Kansas City. Won a ring. This little slip move there. But to almost no avail as Alex Highsmith makes the stop on Elliott. Second and nine. You see T.J. Watt back out in the field for Pittsburgh. A couple plays that he had to kind of recalibrate, get himself ready. And he's back out in the field. But how about a start here for New England? This is an offense that has not had a lot of good things going. We expected them to be able to run the ball, lean on Zeke Elling in the run game. And Bill O'Brien here early comes out with a crowded line of scrimmage from the Steelers and tests them one-on-one downfield. And why not? Devontae Parker, number one receiver, he's out tonight. He was on the injured list with a knee. And Zappi just throws that one away. Third down and nine for North Carolina. One of the things about throwing on early downs, Bill O'Brien, he knows it's going to help his offensive line. There's a major concern with Alex Highsmith on one side, T.J. Watt on the other, to avoid these situations right now. Third and long where Watt and Highsmith can come after you. But throwing on early downs helps with the pass protection. Let's see how they hold up here. And also an offensive line that's been another of New England's trouble spots. Zappi coming out the side door, and he's going to pick up the first down as he scoops out of bounds at the 14-yard line. What a great job is stepping up. We just talked about the edge pressure. Well, when you get edge pressure here and here, you've got to be able to come back and win this game. Right, so they were 3-0 in prime time. That's their first nighttime loss. So upcoming, they go to Indianapolis a week from Sunday. Cincinnati comes here, and then they just picked up a few first downs, and then ended up getting into that rhythm, and they throw the touchdown pass to Deontay Johnson. So see if they can pick up where they left off as an offense, because that was really the first time they felt like they found the offensive rhythm that they were looking for the entire first 30 minutes. Yeah, Trubisky, 6 of 11 for 61 yards. Hey, Mike's left, Mike's left. In the pocket. Settles for underneath. And nothing happening right there as Parrish is taken down by Tavai. You know, Trubisky's been challenged his entire career, like a lot of quarterbacks in the NFL. But I think tonight you saw him challenged. He threw an ugly pick. Crowd is booing. They're chanting Mason Rudolph, booing him relentlessly after any incompletion. And he was able to fight through that. adversity. And here's a look at Mason Rudolph and get him on the board. Now, I don't know if he's going to bring him back in his second half, but he showed a lot of guts there to be able to get through that part of this game. Yeah, no question. Second down and ten. Draw. Harris. It's so funny. You've been around a long time where, you know, oftentimes if the starter's not doing well, they want the number two quarterback is the most popular guy in town. Tonight, for a while, the number three quarterback was the most Five of the guy in town. No doubt about that. I mean, Mason Rudolph's a guy that was booed last year when they brought him in in preseason. So, you know, it's just been one of those years for this offense. Anytime you let your offensive coordinator go in the middle of the year, obviously, it's a struggle. They're searching for an identity. Let's go, Mike's eight. Mike's eight. And there was the number one quarterback. Can he pick it? Mike is eight. Ankle surgery on the shelf for, they say, two to four weeks. Third and four. Pass court. That'll pick up a first down, get the crowd into it. Pat, prior move, making the grab there. It's a nice option route, and he's such a dangerous weapon and has such a good feel for zone or man. It's almost like he just trots off the line of scrimmage. He's just reading. Where's the leverage? And he just turns. You know, that's a, depending on what defense they're in, he knows exactly how far he needs to go to get beyond the sticks and just flips around. and you know that Trubisky was locked in on Big 88 there. Anytime he turned, the ball was coming out. The second catch of the night. Give it to Austin. He in turn gives it to Warren. Circles all the way back. Starts to stumble. That one doesn't work. The earlier trick play did. Second down. Dietrich Wise makes the tackle. That's a loss of seven yards. Remember, they had that big reverse earlier. And they don't fool him this time. Wise does his job. This guy's a big man, very underrated at 6'6", 280, playing on that edge. Starts to commit down and then sees what Warren's doing. And just by getting in the way and slowing him down allows the speed of that defense. So good discipline that time and good vision by the big defensive end, Dietrich Wise. Are you going to hog that? Oh, we're good, we're good. We're waiting. Warren. gets to about the 30-yard line to by making the tackle there third and 11 upcoming really kind of in on a national level you look at a national football league you start thinking about name some great players on this patriots defense i think that's why i love this defense so much it's really hard to think of names that just jump out with judon out with his his injury there just isn't that guy the rookie christian gonzalez started to flash a little early then he goes down with an injury. Other than that, it's just a bunch of guys who love to play football together and play hard as a unit. And that's happened a lot in the Belichick years in New England. Brings guys in off the street. They do the job. Third down and ten. Catch is made. Hurl's made. Close to a first down. Connor Hayward. Tam's brother. And it's enough for the first. I was looking for 97 to come down there and give him a big bear hug. What a job by the big man. It got nothing over. I mean, I thought, oh, he's just checking it down. They're going to have to punt this away. But Hayward had different ideas. First the athleticism there, and then the power to bounce off of that, and then the awareness to get the ball across the marker. Jones looking for the license plate on that runaway truck. First down from the 40-yard line. Breaks a tackle. as Harris in terms of it might have been a two-yard loss into a seven-yard gain. Second and three, Duggar making the tackle. Yeah, it looked like Jennings had him, and then Duggar had him both times. It looked like he was going to be brought down in the backfield, and that's what they're doing, throwing the ball, because right now they're out of rhythm in a big way. Meanwhile, the touchdown maker, Henry, goes into the tent. On the New England side, second down and seven. Flag. And a two-yard gain here for Warren. Clay Martin to give us the call. If I were Mike Tomlin, illegal formation at week 14 or whatever week we're in right now, that would drive me crazy. Five men in the backfield. Got to have at least seven up front. Looking over to Belichick to see what he wants to do. It was a two-yard game. We'll be third and five. On the offense, number 76 had reported as an eligible receiver but did not cover the tackle. Penalties declined. It's third down. He'll take the play. It's a core of four. Oh, yeah. He is exorcised. You're going to make mistakes, but you just can't make mental mistakes. You know, and again, they end up declining. It gets to another third down, and they've not converted yet on third down tonight. Third and five. Rush four. She basically throws, and that one's thrown out of bounds. Said they're there for Deontay Johnson. His first target of the night. And the boos are running down there after every play. Yeah, I think low percentage throw on third down and medium. Instead of trying to find something, you know, where tied in or back out of the backfield or a matchup with a crosser, they go for a heave-ho downfield. No shot. Harvin, short kick. He takes a New England bounce and more booze rain down. What a start for the Steelers tonight. 9.48 left in the half. 14.3. Touch. So we're 2-10. By the way, they're a fifth seed. They're right in the thick of things. This is a must-win game. And they're playing a team who's 2-10 again, the Patriots. and this is the effort that they put forth here for about a quarter and a half. Pretty terrible thus far. Here's Elliott. Meanwhile, the crowd frustrated about so many things, but they looked at that schedule and they said, hey, we've got Arizona coming in. We've got New England coming in. Those are two wins. They've already lost Arizona, and now they're 11 points down to the other two-win team. Yeah, and you've got some great leaders. You know, people wanted to blame Matt Canada. They wanted to blame this. They wanted to blame that. It's like at some point the leaders on this team, have always been the difference in the Steelers, the great Steelers team. They lead from within is the leadership from the players. They need to step up right now. Somebody needs to make some plays, get some fire back in this team. Sappy throws. Caught about three yards shy of the first, but trying to pick up a little extra yardage there is Farrell Brown. I guess what's just amazing, I'm sure, for you and I watching, people at home watching, is the Patriots are 2-10. I mean, to get a team to continue to play with fire and to be inspired and to give you some, like, we're showing up, we're going to be accountable, and as he says, do your job. You're seeing that from a team that's 2-10. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh, they're right in the thick of this thing with a wild card, and it's like they almost have looked disinterested the last couple weeks. Yeah. Tomlin said, horrible day at the office, and this one has started out the same way. Third down and three. Montgomery's in the game. Zappi throws. That's caught on the run, getting free. Juju Smith-Schuster takes it to the 25-yard line. Hmm. They continue to go after these linebackers on third down. Again, they've had so many injuries. You see them showing pressure. They drop here, and that opens it up. Watch his head get on a swivel. He worries about to his right. Great job of recognizing that by Zappi. He had two options in the middle. Linebacker takes his option off to the left. The tight ends, no problem. Gets the ball to Juju Smith for that first down. 28-yard gain. He's already picked up 82 receiving yards tonight. Most he's had in any game this season. Zappi. Throwing. Caught. Henry. Touchdown. Whoa. So Henry, who scored the prior touchdown, went into the medical tent for just a moment comes Pickens moves to the inside and the pass is caught prior move for the two points turned an 18-point deficit into a three-point deficit the block kick right there what do anything thank you and a lot to yell and stamp your feet about especially turning it an 18-point deficit into a three-point depth and they're right back in it and you look at his wind probability this our next take a look at our next kid stats powered by AWS and this is before and then after the block time this team has fought, put themselves in a position after the score, 33%, hit the two-pointer, and all of a sudden, the stadium is alive. This is kind of what you expected. This is what Mike Tomlin talked to us about. It's a redemption week for them after last week's game, and now they're starting to show that heart and that attitude you expect from a Mike Tomlin coach team. Right after an awful first quarter and a half, here's Elliott and his big night continues as he skirts the sideline comes close to a first down going to spot the ball just a little bit short of it second down how about Zappi starts 14-21 I think we were all marveling everyone around the country 196 yards, 3 touchdowns gets sacked by Roberts and since then just 4 of 6 for about 35 yards Come back to earth. Second at inches. Zeke. And as he gets to the line of scrimmage. Coming into the spot right now. It's Landon Roberts. Who was there, but Zeke got the inches necessary. First down. The Patriots are trying to work a double team to be able to try to get up to these backers, but they are not hesitating. So they pick up the first down, but watch how fast. You know, these guys are getting downhill. It makes it tough in the line. Because look at your right, 62 and 71. They want to try to get up to those linebackers, but tough to do when they're flying downhill. Elliott, tacking in the backfield. T.J. Watt with a tackle for loss, a loss of one, second down and 11. How about the right guard? He's playing at Eastern Michigan last year, and now he's a rookie in the NFL, playing for the Patriots. He's got to try to make this block from the right guard spot. Right there, he misses because of the quickness of T.J. Watt. Again, not just a pass rusher, great job against the run. Sidney Sow, rookie out of Eastern Michigan, fourth-round pick zappy's gonna take off but not get very far is going to say that he's helmet the helmet looks around for the call doesn't get it Roberts and open Joby were right there third down and ten Towels twirling. Almost everybody standing. Their team has turned it around totally. Zappi to the outside. It's going to be caught. But a little shy on the first down. Smith-Schuster setting up a fourth down. and inches. Patrick Peterson is there to make the stop. Clock runs down under nine minutes and in comes the punt group. Steelers defense does their job again. We've talked about Trubisky, the plays they've had to make to give themselves a chance to get points on the board, but this thing starts with the Steelers defense after giving up 21 early. They've been putting up some blanks and giving their offense a chance. Bryce Barringer, this will be his seventh punt of the night. The last one was blocked. Gets this one away. And two deep. Sends it into the end zone. And back come the Steelers starting from the 20-yard line with eight and a half to go in the fourth. 21-18 New England. Zeke Elliott, same drive, gets kicked in the face. It's a really tough way for the best players in the league to get started. Fair catch called for. Made. 26-yard line. 244. Postseason picture right now. Miami and Baltimore each 9-3 atop their divisions. Kansas City and Jacksonville each 8-4. At the moment, the Steelers will be a wild card. Trying to get to 8-5. Cleveland to 7-5. So is Indianapolis. You've got the Texans and the Broncos. And you've got the Bengals with that big win the other night in Buffalo, and Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, who we'll see next week all in the hunt. Yeah, all four teams in the AFC North with what Cincinnati did against Jacksonville in the mix, obviously the Steelers and the Browns. Going to the wire. Only one team gets the bye. The other six go to the wild card round. Up to three to get to the Super Bowl. Trubisky fires a little high, intended for Friermuth over the middle and incomplete. Second down and ten. Usually Friermuth, with his catch radius, can make that play. Hayward and Watt looking on. It's amazing what this Steelers team has had to do to get back into this game. And at this point, you know, you're looking for Friermuth. You're looking for Najee Harris and Warren out of the backfield. Can you isolate Pickens? I'll tell you, Deontay Johnson's had a quiet night. Not many opportunities for number 18. Yeah, just three targets, one catch. But it was for the touchdown. Trubisky. That's time. Dumps it up underneath. That's going to result in a first down. Taking it to the 40-yard line goes Najee Harris. Clock running under two and a half. Good job with showing patience by Trubisky. Instead of forcing it, getting impatient with that good coverage downfield, he eventually finds his check down, just get it to a back, and let him pick up the first down. They'll hurry up. Trubisky to the outside, too high, no good. That one intended for Johnson. Fourth time he's been targeted tonight. Make it second down and 10, 2.09 to go. One thing that's hurt the Patriots this year is they don't have that difference maker, like Matthew Judon, who can get home without having to blitz. Typically, they've got to dial up a blitz to get some kind of pressure. It's been kind of the Achilles heel for this defense all year long, especially in this obvious situation. Can they affect Trubisky enough? Have two sacks tonight to this point. Second and ten. To the outside quickly. Caught, getting out of bounds. Johnson forced out by J.C. Jackson. Took only a few seconds off the clock. 2.05 now before the two-minute warning. Just two plays right there from Trubisky that easily could get overlooked. The check down to Najee Harris to pick up the first down. And then this time sees soft coverage out there by the corner and just aborts everything and just flips it out there. Take the positive yard, set up a third down and short here near midfield. Steve Belichick there. You saw Mike Sullivan calling in the play. third and two Harris flips wide to the left go empty here Trubisky fires too high, incomplete tended there for Pickens and you still have one second before the two minute warning so a break there is they'll go for it on fourth down in effect still have that Extra time out at the two-minute warning plus the one they have. But they have to convert. Yeah, yeah, this is it. Fourth down and two. Season on the line. Opportunities on the line to be able to keep this drive alive and keep their energy and hopes alive here. Jalen Warren is in the backfield. Hey, yellow, yellow. Three, two, three, three. Good luck. Need two. Going deep. Going for it. Oh! An incomplete. Intended for Johnson. So needed two yards and went for the home run. Jonathan Jones covering. That takes us to the two-minute warning with 1.55 officially on the clock. And the Patriots still up by three. The Steelers could get the ball back. But next to no time remaining. First things first. I don't understand that call. No, neither do I. I mean, that was Mazzaro. On the fourth and two. Who came first? Offense number 85. It's real easy to sit up here. A little bit short. Starts to slide a couple of yards short. Bentley is there. That's going to take us to the end of the quarter. And a fourth and two to begin the fourth period. End of three in Pittsburgh. 21 to 10 New England. Back after this. This is the end of the third quarter. coming on on the sidelines. So right from the get-go, they're going to go for it on fourth down. And a long two. Trubisky dancing. Flips it, and it's going to be short of the first down, and they'll turn the ball over. So he flips it to Warren. Needed two yards. Got one. Patriots take over. He got Mack Wilson in on the stop. well the Patriots know this is the target when they get down to this area and watch what they do to Friar Muth right here you got two guys one of them hits him Bentley he breaks free but by the time he sees him it's too late he comes off of him and just flips it to Warren because of that coverage and recognition by Juwan Bentley so good job of anticipating the big tight end is the target took him away you can see the frustration there with the Steelers and Wilson right there as well so they get the ball back at their own seven-yard line. So Tomlin rolling the dice. Crapping out on that one. Down by 11. Pass on the outside. Short game. Thornton makes the catch. Patrick Peterson, 13th year in the league. He's been around a long time. Arizona and Minnesota most recently with the stop. The bigger plays that Zeke Elliott has made tonight is on that interception where he hustled and prevented Pittsburgh from getting into the end zone on that interception. Chased it down and hustled and forced the Steelers' offense onto the field. Second and seven. Elliott over the right side third and two go back to that tackle on the interception it's a good job, good play we talked about Roberts making the play to deflect it Walker gets the tip now watch Zeke Elliott hustle downfield if he doesn't make that play he goes into the end zone so good job of coming up with that defense steps up Zeke getting the opportunity with an injury to Stevenson and making the very most of it. You're right, that tackle save would have been a touchdown. Third down and two from the 15-yard line. Zappi flushed out. Going to throw on the run along the sideline. And that is Thornton who is there. And it's incomplete. So, from deep in their own territory, they'll punt it back to the Steelers. There's this spin move from TJ Y. From the outside back to the inside. Flushes him. I'll tell you, Zappi, don't make that critical air. Almost does it again. Throws behind and late. Look how close that was to an interception. Porter who almost had the pick. And the kick is going to be blocked. Miles Kilbrue their special teams maven gets in there And that going to set Pittsburgh up at around the 25 line Ever since the touchdown at the end of the first half, the Steelers have come alive. Now, they've got to capitalize on the opportunities. They missed it after the interception. Good hustle play right here. bounces right off his chest and the Steelers are going to get outstanding field position. Gilbert with the special team's ace. Ball skids out to the 26 yard line. 13 and a half to play in regulation. Sudden change. Do you give Pickens a shot? Do you just put one up in the air and see if he can get underneath it and use his height to go up and make a play? Yeah, you would think at some point. Haven't done it yet. There he is on the right side. Stack receivers. Keep it on the ground here. Nice run here. Game of six. Najee Harris to the 20-yard line. Second down. Great push there on that. They did it once. They don't get it here. They'll go for it on fourth down. As that clock keeps ticking. and the opportunities are going to get fewer and fewer now that they're down the one timeout in the two-minute warning. Yep. That'll avoid a sack. That'll be the worst scenario. Third and three. Trubisky under pressure, escaping, and just has to fling that one away. Brian Ruth was there. He was well covered. So now you've got a fourth and three. and now the punt unit starts to come out and they will take the field here. Give credit to Steve Belichick and that defense again on that third down. Good job at taking away all his options and Trubisky just ends up throwing this football away. So Presley Harvin to send it down from Miles Bryant. Meanwhile, he got a flag. He got a couple of flags. The movement on the right side there. And it was fourth and three, so that's going to be a first out of his against New England. I think it's Tavai, 48. Clay Martin with the ultimate judgment. False start. Whoa, baby. Number 36. Five-yard penalty. Four down. Yeah. It's 48, Tavai, the linebacker. How fired up is Pittsburgh? They're actually going to get together. They're calling this on the center. He said a false start on Christian Puntz. And if that is against, indeed, against Pittsburgh, calling it a false start, that is the first penalty of the night against the Steelers. at the most inopportune time. Terry, what did you see? Well, we want to see this in real time. It looks like they called his head snapping up. Now, he can do that as long as it's slow and deliberate. All right, I'm going to check that out after the punt. We'll go to a break, then we'll bring Terry back in. It's fair court at the 14-yard line, 458. We'll go to a commercial, then we'll replay that for you. Take another look right now. Preview look. Back after the middle. Terry, you watched it. What are they telling you? What are you saying? So they're saying that he made a quick and abrupt movement prior to the snap. I don't see this as quick and abrupt. I mean, obviously, it's subjective. This looks like normal movement that we see from a long snapper. I think this should have been on the defense. You see that almost every time on a snap, and it's never called. I think that's a bad call. Yeah, Tavai thought it was on him, but he escapes. Meanwhile, New England now in a situation where they can take all the time they want off that clock because Pittsburgh only has that one timeout plus the two in the morning. Yeah, it looked like the Steelers caught a huge break with Tavai jumping off. But to all of our surprise, it ends up going against the Steelers. So now the defense from the Steelers again is going to have to step up. That clock keeps ticking. They used two timeouts. Patriots all of its points all their points coming in the first half again using that play clock second and six the workhorse Elliott comes up about three yards shy of the first down so Zeke tonight has carried the ball 19 times 53 yards that's not particularly impressive those numbers with seven catches for 72. And I think the biggest thing he was looking forward to tonight was the opportunity to get more touches. You know, he's one of those backs, the more touches he gets, the better he gets, but it's just very tough to run the ball against his Steelers front. So that note, last 56 games, we're leading by 10 or more. Had an 18-point lead at one point. Using all of that play clock, he's zapping on the third down and two. Here's Elliott again, and this time he will not get it. That's exactly what the Steelers needed here. Three and out. Save the time. They get the ball back. Cam Hayward made that tackle. You rely on your leaders. We talked a lot about T.J. Watt. Cam Hayward made a play earlier this time. He just does a great job of being able to use leverage, get off of that block by Andrews. These Steelers, these veterans, knew exactly what was at stake and how important a three and out was to preserve that clock. And they did their job again to get the ball back. Barringer's eighth punt of the night. Fourteenth punt of the game. Last Thursday night, we had a game with no punts. New England's some credit. They've been able to hold up, but, man, 90 just is relentless. And if you can't get the pass rush home, making an impact, getting New England behind the sticks, defending this run game, and still leading, and really a big part of the spark of this defense to get them back in this game. A couple of hurries, one tackle for loss. So now Trubisky, who they were trying to boo out of the building about an hour and a half ago. Trying to lead a game-tying or a game-changing drive here. He starts with a short pass to Najee Harris for a gain of four. I really liked what Mike Tomlin told us this week when he was talking about having a backup that's a veteran. He said, you know, early when I was a coach, we had Big Ben, and we had a veteran quarterback, and we had rookies that were the backups, and if he went down, we had a real concern. Now it's kind of flipped the script. Now you have Kenny Pickett, a young quarterback, and now when he goes down, we've got a guy that's a veteran. It's taken some of that veteran leadership to get through the adversity tonight for Trubisky. They played in the Pro Bowl, low snap. That's been an issue with this team recently. Look out into all kinds of traffic, and somehow some way that wasn't picked. Boy, did Jennings make a great play on this football, and you're right. You know, you talk about that veteran experience, but here he just clearly does not see 33. Set a rush in the quarterback. He sends his screen, gets his hands on the, in fact, running back, and almost gets his left hand on that football to tip it up into the air. So just good instincts there on that second down play on the screen, which they've hit a few of those here in this second half. Now a third down and five. Send an extra man. Passes. Pulled in at the 29-yard line by Friar. And you can see where the official is. They're going to spot it short. Do you dare now? You got fourth down. You got fourth down at inches. 7-20. Punt group comes out. Crowd doesn't like it. One crowd likes it. Now they're going to whistle down by the Steelers side. They're going to call timeout. Oh, man. So that leaves them in a three-point game with one timeout and a little over seven to play. I don't think you call a timeout to punt here. So they're going to call a timeout. They're going to get this offense together. Right, 30-second timeout. We can tell you next week we're in Vegas. You've got the Chargers and the Raiders who played some classics through the years. San Diego and Oakland, now Los Angeles and Las Vegas, each 5-7. Big game as each tries to stay in the playoff punt. So they did call a timeout. They are going to go for it after all of that with the ball just shy of the 30-yard line. Need a half a yard. Harris is the running back. Tight formation. Trubisky keeps it himself. Gets it. Goes over the left guard. Picks up the first down. Now they love him. They get a good push on that left side. Watch this. left guard, left tackle good job by Trubisky, I think he was initially going to get right behind Mason Cole but ends up seeing that surge and just steps in behind that left side of the offensive line Sam Allo is right there to lead the way six and a half left in the fourth Trubisky to the outside Pickens makes the grab picks up about eight Jonathan Jones in on the tackle the second down. Jones walked up tight to press and at the snap of the football dropped and Trubisky able to look out there. He's been dying to get the football to Pickens all night. He's his go-to guy. Guy that likes to make plays typically downfield. He's had a relatively quiet night. Four catches and 18 yards. Longest reception was for seven yards. Longest catch of the night by Johnson. The only one he's caught tonight. Now it's for the touchdown. 2nd and 3. Pickens again. And he's stopped in his tracks. Jonathan Jones there making that tackle. That's going to set up a 3rd and 3. Clock running down to 540. Got to think. Duo block. Double team in the inside. Able to get up to those linebackers. We haven't seen a lot of surges into that Patriots front, especially between the tackles. That time we did. Very positive gain there on first and ten. Squandered the opportunity after the interception. Now another really good opportunity here. Join this late. It was 21-3 at one point. 11-point game right now. Pittsburgh trying to narrow the margin. Second down and four. Play action. Under pressure. Gets it away. Caught. And down the sideline goes Darnell Washington. The big tight end. And I mean big. It's 6'7", 264. His first catch of the night. His first target of the night. First down. Yeah, really built like a tackle. You know, but at Georgia, he would get his hands on the football. Brock Bauer's the best tight end in college football. But Washington, not known as just being a blocker. I've been surprised so far early in his career. That's what he's been doing for Pittsburgh's offense. But you talk about a weapon down the red zone. Yeah. 6'7", like you said, 264 pounds. It can move. Pittsburgh dressed four tight ends tonight. He's one of them. Hayward, another, has caught two. And now you've got to take a timeout here to the chagrin of the crowd. 30 seconds. Meanwhile, I'm going to tell you tonight's journey is being presented by Unday. You've got Bailey Zappi with three touchdowns in the first half. Go up 21-3. Trubisky, meanwhile, there are his numbers. 93 yards and a little more than three quarters. Nothing for T.J. Watt, who was in and out of the medical tent early. No sacks tonight for him yet. Yeah, Watts had to show some toughness just getting through that first play. But to give credit to New England, done a pretty good job on him, even when they high-sowed on him in pass protection. They replaced the communication system, we're being told, in Trubesky's helmet. And that's why they had to take their timeout, which of course is very significant in the second half in a close game. First and goal. Trubisky to the end zone and that's incomplete. The flag is thrown. Fryer Moose covered by Jackson. this is what makes Friar Moose so effective is he can be in line traditional tight end or you can flex him out because he's got the skill set to be able to run these rounds the ball is placed at the one yard line automatic first down UC Jackson there that's a mismatch as far as physicality out in space doesn't have the quickness but he has the size and it was tough for Jackson. Just grabs onto him. Number 76 is an eligible receiver. That's a four-a-four comes in as an eligible receiver right now. The tackle, first down and goal. Look at this. Incomplete of all things. And Mack Wilson breaks it up. You have Connor Hayward throwing it. Wilson is there to knock it down to go to the back of the playbook you tell me on a first and goal you know they're trying to get creative but this isn't the place for this you got a tight end throwing a pass on first and goal after a pass interference Wilson almost comes down with that that's covered downfield as well so you're inside a one yard line just pound the rock no Pittsburgh special on that one second and goal and going into the end zone, touchdown. Trubisky does it himself. And Tomlin says we're going to go for two to make it a three-point game. Heck of a job on that play by Mason Cole. Just took the nose guard out, made it easy for Trubisky to go over top of him. So trying to shave it to the margin of a field goal right now. Two-point play coming up. 11.44 left in the fourth. Mike's left here. Mike's left. Notepad on the table there on the podium. Not going to be the HC of the NYJ. Kraft had to give up a number one pick for him. First year he was 5-11, and then after that, off to the races. I think the biggest thing we've learned in these last few years with Tom Brady moving on is that as good as Bill Belichick is, you've got to have, you're not going to get another Tom Brady, but you've got to have a difference maker at that position to give yourself a chance to be competitive. Right. You know, our pregame crew had a great conversation. You saw it before the game, but you're talking about, you know, a lot of people say, well, Belichick's nothing without Brady. That's total nonsense. I mean, you know, they were a hell of a team. It's real simple. Yeah, they work together. It's like looking at Bill Walsh and Joe Montana. Right. You know, Bill Walsh was outstanding. He was really good when Joe Montana was back there and Steve Young. Right. It works hand in hand. Second and three. And Elliott will set up a third down and short. I think there's one area you're going to critique. it's not the football coach and what he does. It's putting the roster together and what they've done over these last few years. Now, that's the aspect that if you're going to really critique and look at New England and say where they could get better, that's the obvious area that jumps out when you look at some of these draft picks. Yeah, no question about that. And, look, he got all of the power after he'd won that third Super Bowl. So he was the coach, even though he had other guys in the office who were very important, Nick Casario, Ernie Adams, and other people. it was Bill who made the ultimate decisions. Third and two. And that'll be a first down. Just to put a bow on it, if he goes someplace else, is that owner ready to give him that autonomy? Or will Bill just say, you know what, I'll just coach the team? Right. It'll be fascinating. One way or another, if he comes back he's probably going to go out and find a quarterback. Do they go out and try to find a quarterback that's already in the league? Do they go out with the draft? There's a lot of big names that are going to be coming out in the draft this year that are very capable, but you're starting over with another rookie quarterback. So it's an interesting offseason, obviously, with New England and everything that's in front of them. Zappi. Broken up. Intercepted. Fitzpatrick was in the middle of it, and meanwhile that is Walker. Michael Walker with the interception and taking it down deep into New England territory. They've attacked these linebackers. They've attacked them. This time it's Roberts who looks like he gets involved here, number 50, to be able to make a play on the ball right here. They've attacked this area most of this game. Good job by Roberts, who's really known more for his first and second down play, but this time against Juju Smith. He's able to get his hand in there, knock that football loose, and it goes up into the air. So they've been going to that region. This time it ends up paying off for the Steelers. Good heads-up play. And we talked about these quarterbacks. Don't make the disastrous play in your own territory. And the Patriots have done that right here with Zappi Walker. Fourth year out of Fresno State. Picked them up as a free agent this year. makes the play that can put them right back into the game after a one-yard carry here. Gottschall makes the tackle there. Final minute of the third quarter. Remember this first half when they were down 21-3? We said, where is the leadership? Where's the fire from this Steelers team? This is a team that's 7-5 in the thick of things in the AFC wildcard race. They're not playing like that after a tough game last week against the Cardinals. Give them credit for giving themselves a chance here. Now can they capitalize and punch it into the end zone? Second and nine. Good protection. But good coverage as well by the secondary. And he has to flip it away. Booze. Rain down again. Third and nine. good protection better coverage downfield all he can do is throw it away so here they go with a big third down only hit 3 of 10 so far Trubisky is thrown for only 92 yards on 12 of 19 third down and 9 pressure from behind He's going to run. Trubisky looking for the first half. Second guess calls, but it's just such a low percentage throw. I mean, you've got a couple go balls on the outside. A tight end, Friar Muth, is locked up. You just throw it and hope. I mean, it's fourth and two. You haven't thrown to Deontay Johnson all night. You're just trying to get a flag here. I mean, it's a low percentage throw. Roll him out, move him, try to create maybe a rub or a pick. Give yourself an option there. They just threw it up there. Totally with you, dude. Totally with you. Here goes Elliott now. Pittsburgh will take its final timeout. They're third and final. Just a 30-second timeout. It's a tough couple weeks for Pittsburgh. Oh, boy. You look at that Cardinals game last week. Maybe it was an aberration. Two and ten team. You follow it up. It's desperation. Here we go. Short week. We're going to come back and show them who we really are and then come up short again tonight. Post-game show coming up. Carissa and the gang. Kaylee with the star of the game. Talk about Zappie's night. Steelers got back into the game, but it might be too little too late. All coming up on the JCPenney postgame show. On the other side, New England and Bill Belichick left for dead at 2-10. I mean, they're not going anywhere, but the fact that they came out and competed, had some big injuries, Zeke Elliott steps up for Stevenson. Zappi played well enough to win this game, grew up a little bit. So some positives, at least for New England tonight. Elliott. Well, that should take us just about to the finish line if they spot the ball for a first down. As the clock keeps on running, and it will. I mean, you look at New England's season, and all you need to know is that they got flexed out of a game on Monday Night Football with Patrick Mahomes coming to town. That sums it up. That does sum it up. It really does. And Bill Belichick, well, he... That play is now under further review. All right, so for the moment, they call it a first down. All reviews, of course, come from upstairs at this point in the game. Belichick says, you've got to be kidding me. So if it's not a first down, it would be third down in inches. And they would start the clock. Boy, Zeke Elliott talks about getting stronger as the game goes on. That's what he did in college. That's what he did in his early days with the Cowboys. It looks like the knee is down on that shot. Here's our next-gen stats powered by AWS Patriots tonight. It's the chance of winning, entering tonight, 35%. I can't believe that's at 100%. It's not quite at 100%. The current is 99.2%. Somehow the Steelers are holding on to .8. Right. Okay. By the way. No miracle at the Meadowlands here. By the way, Bill Belichick is going to be our celebrity picker on college game day. I know. And I am so excited that he won, so he'll be in a good mood at the Army-Navy game at Foxborough. I know it's 99.9%. He's going to pick Navy. You know that. I think that's, yeah, 99.9999. Guaranteed. Full history of the family. Father Steve at the Naval Academy. Yeah, it looked like. After review, the runner was short of the line to gain when he was down by contact. It'll be third and a half from the 39. the tail of the 39-yard line. Please set the game clock to 146. By rule, we will run 10 seconds down to 136. The play clock should be set to 30 seconds in this situation. Okay, the play clock goes to 30. 146. So before they snap it, you can take it down to, you know, 112 or so. There you go. 136. Got 30 seconds to get the playoff. Third down in inches. So at worst, you'll have a fourth down with a minute. And then they can do whatever they want with it. Maybe take another 40 seconds off the clock. That's why you have a point. That's my point. He's hanging in there. One thing about Bailey Zappi tonight. It just felt like he and Bill O'Brien were in sync and had their rhythm early. Ball was coming out, decisive, throwing to the tight ends, throwing Zeke Elliott out of the backfield. That's their strength. The receivers are still not the threats that they need downfield. But, man, they found some matchups that they liked, and they were hitting them early. So they're going to run the clock down here, and then New England will take a timeout. Timeout. New England, their first. 30 seconds. And a reminder once again, to Vegas we go next week. Chargers-Raiders on Thursday Night Football. See what Antonio Pierce and company have in store. Chargers needed that win in New England desperately the other day and got it 6-0. Good love and life the next couple weeks. Las Vegas, quick flight, Los Angeles. You're just going to walk to that game. How empty coast-to-coast do you think one can make? You earned it. You earned it. No, you earned it. You earned it. From Martinsville, Virginia to Corvallis, you earned it. Setting up for the tush-tush here. And there you have it. Nobody can run that except for Kelsey and Jalen Hurts. They're the only ones. So he doesn't get it. I think he lost yards. Yep. You got Henry and you got Brown there. I just think of Kelsey when I watched that. Yeah. Makes it happen. Zero push. Nothing. The Eagles get three yards on that play every time. So it's still fourth down. And here comes with the clock running down. They can run the clock down now to about 20, 21. you got this is why you have that point it moved to point nine it went to point nine right because Barron already had a punt line 30 seconds I'm telling you look the most amazing thing tonight 31 points in the first half and you know what I'm talking about and everybody knows what I'm talking about everybody could take a deep breath they could what the hell We waited 30 minutes and it's over. Done deal. Yep. That was great. I think it was the lowest over or under total in like 18 or 19 years in the NFL. Not that anybody pays attention to it. A little bit. Just a tiny bit in today's world. Okay. Nose down. Ball in the air. Skids out of bounds, and that comes a few seconds off that clock. So you've got 15 seconds. So what do you do here? You've got the 15-way lateral. Too far for a Hail Mary. With 15 seconds, you put one up to Pickens, and you hope maybe for either he makes a play or you get a pass interference. if he makes a play you've got to get out of bounds obviously I think I would just try to look for a throw it as far as you can and try to get a pass interference get two receivers off to the left here yep two left, two right, go two by two Patriots only rush three eight back, Trubisky fires over the middle that's caught, Johnson is going to try to get out of bounds and he does so Deontay Johnson with 7 seconds is able to move the ball out to the 36 yard line and now you know Bischie's arm, who knows he fell on his route, got back up, caught the football and then somehow he was able to fight to the sideline to stop that clock Go four wide again, two by two. Fubisky is going to fire over the middle. That's going to be caught. Now you've got a lateral, but that's going to be skinning around and winds up in the hands of New England. Allen Robinson was there, so they were looking for the hook and ladder, hook and trailer, whatever you want to call it. And instead they come away with a loss. So think about the fact the Pittsburgh Steelers, they look at the schedule. They're 7-4. You've got two two-win teams coming in on Sunday and Thursday and lose both. Yeah, just one of the bigger surprises, especially the fact that they're here in Pittsburgh to lose to two teams. You lose to the Cardinals, and you say, okay, we've got to get this thing right. We're playing the Steelers. We're playing the Patriots and Bill Belichick. We know they're going to come in here. They're going to test us. This is a chance for redemption. And they end up starting. They started so slow. They just didn't have a chance.
