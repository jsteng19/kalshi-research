 Really is not, because he blocks like a tight end at times. All these receivers block, so I think it's a little bit misleading because they still are so versatile with, you know, Stafford's under center, he's in the gun, they're in pistol, they motion, they're in bunch, just a lot to prepare for. One of the few times they run a play without motion tonight. The plenty of motion provided there by Williams, whose knee was not down, tries to secure some extra yards, but they say, well, we'll just give you a 10.5. Good enough for a first down. They've been hammering downhill with the duo, with the inside zone plays, and this time they're going to run a counter that requires a different style of running by Williams, more patience. Let those blocks in front of him get established. Kind of set those blocks up, use division, and then accelerate upfield. Man, he does it all for this offense. Nice block by the rookie side end, Davis Allen. up in motion Williams again Williams cuts it back Williams keeps going Williams takes it inside the 10 yard line Kyron Williams over a thousand yards it is a season tonight 18 81 81 yards in this game and there is a mama Kyron Williams Kyron's mom She's got to be living a dream watching her son first at Notre Dame and now playing with Matthew Stafford and being such a big part of this offense for the Rams. Second and three. Again, again, touchdown. And almost on cue. flips it to Mama. How cool is that? That was perfect. How great is that? It's got to be in the right end zone. You have to know where Mama's sitting. You score. Perfect. Back-to-back plays. The jet motion creates a reaction from watch the linebackers react to Cooper Cup. That frees up the lineman to be able to get up to that second level with favorable blocking angles and it just opens up. They're so concerned and have to have their eyes on Cooper Cupp. So great compliment. Great work by Mark Teileman, Pierre Moussa. I mean, that's a movie. You show Mama, you go back, he scores a touchdown, he flips the ball to him. Yep. Take one. 27-7. Get in there. Get in there. Get out of here! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! I don't know. Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Not sure it gets any cool for Obama. That's pretty good. Oh, great. Now she's taking some pictures. Be all over social media. Her boy having a big night. 90 ground yards. And we go to Kaylee. Guys, ever since he was just a kid playing football, Kyron Williams has known his mom, Taryn, to be there cheering loudly in the stands. And 1,000%, he said he always knows where she's sitting. So whether he's going to celebrate that touchdown with her, or how about Sunday after he fumbled the ball twice, he told me he looked up to her. She stood up, pounded her chest. He pounded his back, and in that moment he said, That's when I knew I was good because she's always my rock. Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. It's a point we haven't made tonight about what happened with Williams last Sunday against Washington. As the Saints take it in the 25-yard line. Carr has protection. Fires over the middle. That's caught. Olave will take it into Rams territory. But last week, he fumbled twice. He fumbled early in fairly key situations. and going for a touchdown on one. The other is like, you know, a problem, turns it over. Some coaches, but not that guy, would have yanked them. And, you know, he said, hey, I'm staying with you, man. Come on, come on, come on. And he had a big game as it turned out. Yeah, he did. He had 27 carries, not just 152 yards, but I think he shows you he can be an Ironman for you. But I think that Sean McVay knows what he has and the energy that he brings. And I think it's pretty cool. It's that new generation coach that's not going to just say, You're done. Get back to the bench. He's going to work with them. This is a young Rams team, you know, so you have to couple steps forward, one step. Boot, roll, throws, caught. And Cooper Cup gets ridden out of bounds after a short game. Paulson and Debo covering in a four. It's really the first time, and I know that they've won four their last five, but with Stafford healthy off the thumb from about five weeks ago, Nakua, the rookie, and what he's been able to do. Cooper Cupp now getting back, you know, and feeling good. This offense, now with an offensive line and Kyron Williams and the physicality, what they do, all the pieces are in place. And I think you're starting to see the potential of what they can be. Now they bring Ronnie Rivers in. He was just activated. But now with a knee injury, number 20. He gets the carry and picks up a yard or two to make it third down. So Ronnie Rivers would be the number three back because they've got Royce Freeman, who's been the number two back, helping to spell Tyron Williams. You saw Jameis Winston on the bench. These two teams, at least they have big-time backup quarterbacks. Winston on one side, and Carson Wentz is now the ram. Yeah, some people have forgotten about Wentz's here. Great play there on that last play by Demario Davis. As you're down tenure on the road, your veterans, your stars got to make plays and see if they can get off the field here on third down. Stafford, a little shoulder shake, moving. Fine time. Side arm, and that is Demarcus Robinson holding it in. So Robinson, as we mentioned before, he's done a nice job. They picked him up. he's been a great complimentary receiver to this team, picks up the first down. This looks like going back to Kaler's report about tennis. He's working the baseline here a little bit with his shuffle off to the left. And then look at this, almost an underarm flip to pick up that first down. So Stafford's not going to kill you with his feet, but he buys time. And then there's that arm angle where he adjusts it down low and squeezes it in there to Robinson for the first down. Beautiful. 6.15 to go into half. Action again. Pass is incomplete. A little fun fact on Demarcus Robinson. Here's a guy who's been in the league eight years. Meanwhile, you've got Cuff right there. Favoring that shoulder. He's missed some time this year. Looking maybe to his elbow. He took a hit by Demario Davis. Hanging right in there. Watch this hit, Al, as the ball is incomplete. Big middle linebacker, 56. This does a good job of potentially sniffing that out. And that hit right there is, I think, where he started to feel it. Yeah, he's staying in there. In the slot, second down and 10. Shepard throwing and coming back to the 36-yard line and making the catch there is Demarcus Robinson. We started to talk about the fun fact. Eighth year in the league, he's been in the playoffs every year. Of course, one of the reasons was all those years in Kansas City and then last year in Baltimore. Yeah, it's a pretty good run. By the way, the throw that Stafford made last week was insane against the Commanders. Here it is again. Can't even get his feet adjusted. He just throws that with his ability to create the power in his arm from the torque. And just his hips flipped that ball out there. And so Davis being 10-2 on the sideline. Now you've got Tutu Atwell. He's been hurt. He's back in the game. Number five. Carry here is by Ronnie Rivers. Second-year guy out of Fresno State. Second down, Cam Jordan in his 13th year in the league making the tackle as they work on Davis. Got to get their leader back out there. Looks like he's quick to come back. Good to see. Again, you just sit there and you just marvel at that throw. Just not a lot of guys can make that throw. Obviously, guys like Aaron Rodgers and Mahomes and some of the elite players, but only a handful. Mario Davis out of the game. He's played 98% of the snaps this season. Has the green dot, second down and seven. A ton of time here. Looks underneath. Taught Nakua. Then I make it about a third down and four after that catch. Love the way Sean McVay marries his run game with his play-action look. You combine that with the pre-snap movement. It puts so much on the eyes and the ability to communicate for the linebackers and the safeties. you're worried about the motion, you've got to adjust to whatever new formation they're in. Now is it run? Is it play action? Stafford has such good fundamentals. A calls running back Kyron Williams an energizer bunny. In his second season, he's missed four games with an ankle injury and still has the fourth most rushing yards in the NFL. And Puka Nakua, with his physicality and acrobatic catches, has already broken two Rams rookie receiving records with 87 catches for more than 1,100 yards. They didn't pretend to know the impact either of them would have, especially this quickly, but now they are powering a push to the postseason that feels more possible for the win tonight, Al. And a lot of fun to watch as we look at the standings. First, in the south, you've got the Bucs and the Saints are each 7-7. They will meet in Tampa next week. Falcons are 6-8. Meanwhile, the wild card race is right there, so the Eagles will be a wild card right now, And at the moment, the Vikings and the Rams would be in. Seattle and New Orleans are each 7-7. They're right there. Falcons and Packers trying to hold on. Rams won the toss. Defer. Saints will get the ball first. Ethan Evans to kick off. Rashid Shahid, Speed Merchant will let that one sail through the end zone. And out will come the Saints. Coming off two wins in a row. Not allowing a touchdown in either. Derek Carr, his best performance of the season last week at home against the Giants. 23 of 28. Three touchdowns. He didn't have his number one receiver, Chris Olave, who is active tonight. And he had ten different receivers last Sunday. Yeah, the first thing he referenced after the game was the ability to spread the ball around. Olave tonight will have to play a big part in hitting some big plays downfield. Running back is Kamara. Alvin tries to cut it back and picks up about a half a yard. Ernest Jones having a nice year, number 53 in his third year out of South Carolina, making the stop, second down. This Rams defense has been rebuilt around Aaron Donald and Raheem Morris, the defensive coordinator, talking to him last night. He said he hasn't had this much fun as a defensive coordinator in a long time. There's some youth, there's some mistakes, but we're learning each week, and he likes where they are at this point in the year. Getting better and better second and eight. Pass to the outside is caught. Spending to the inside, getting the first down. There is Olave missing his first game of the season last week with an ankle sprain. He really is known for his ability, obviously, to get downfield and make big plays in a vertical passing game with Carr. It's an area they're really working to improve. But any time the secondary sits back like that, You just take an easy opportunity to give you a chance here and get that first down. Shahid split wide as fast as anybody in the league. Off play action. Pass is court. Olave again very close to a first down after the 48-yard line. Michael Hoyt in on the tackle along with Jones. You know, Al, one of the things that I think we talked about this week, and Derek Carr is going to come out, Taysom Hill is going to come in. We'll be talking a lot about that throughout this game. But he was much more decisive. You know, you talked about maybe his most efficient game last week. The ball got out of his hands much faster, and I think he's just getting more comfortable with the players around him. Of course, when you see him go to the bench, that normally means that Taysom Hill comes in. He will take the snap, and he'll run it. He can run it. He can throw it, as you know, if you follow this sport. Catch it. Can do everything and has been doing it for a number of years. And that car comes back in after they pick up the first down. It's one of those things you know it's coming. You're still not going to be able to stop it. I mean, Taysom Hill is as good as anybody you'll see in those short-yarded situations. Everybody talks about Philly for obvious reasons. But Taysom Hill and that gun, you see him back there. You know the tendencies, and it's still tough to stop him on that QB power. Camara is the bat. Fake to him. Carr steps away from the sack. Fires caught. Olave. So he misses that one game, and right now he is right in the middle of the action. He's already caught three on three targets. Witherspoon makes the tackle first down. Yeah, there's going to be pressure right here, and watch how he feels it. Just kind of steps up, doesn't panic, gets his feet set. Vision downfield, it makes a heck of a throw. That's the one area that Derek Carr, I think, has been trying to improve, just getting more and more comfortable with his receivers, is trusting them on their routes when he gets pressure. That time, a great job of it. Already three first downs. Kamara swings to the outside and gets submarined by Witherspoon, number 44, in his seventh year in the league. They picked him up as a free agent last two years with Pittsburgh. Who broke up that time? Yeah, Robinson, yeah, Higby both blocking. It's a great time to call this because they bring Jonathan Abram on a blitz, so you motion the big tight end to get him out in front. Here comes the blitz right here. So once you get that football thrown, now you have one less defender because of the blitz. You got Higby out there blocking, and then Cupps able to make Matthew miss there right at the first down marker. And Robinson as well. The Rams' wide receivers are great blockers. First and ten from the 11-yard line. Williams to the four. Second and three. You and I were talking at the break when he went down and how important he is to this offense. It's just his natural instinctive ability as a runner. and this offense has flourished with him in. Ten games he's been able to play. Look at the difference in the points per game. Nearly double yards per game. So it's just a different offense and it's not just the numbers. If you watch this Rams team, it's the personality, it's the energy, it's the juice that he provides for this team. He's over 1,000 rushing yards this season despite missing those four games. Second and four. Here he goes again. setting up a third down one or a short two third down. It's kind of interesting to see a back like Kyron Williams in a year where coming into the year there was so much talk about the NFL running backs almost as a fraternity being smitten or, you know, not smitten, more frustrated and angered with the way they were being treated as a group and not appreciated. And here's a guy, Kyron Williams, showing you how important running backs still can be. Christopher McCaffrey and what he does with the 49ers, the Miami Dolphins, and what they've been able to do this year. Third and two. Stafford protected well, and then that pass incomplete might have slipped out of his hand. And so it's fourth down. Again, they bog down in the red zone and have to settle for a three-point attempt. you're right and I think Stafford he did try to pull back because the linebacker Pete Werner ended up sliding right there into his throwing lane so that's why he tried to pull the ball back and try to find another option so good job of disguising and fooling Stafford there on that third down he missed the coup on what would have been a wide open touchdown now you've got Havrasek Rams with 11 missed field goals total this year Of course, Edmire early on. Now you've got Havrasek. And this short one from 22 is good. Opening drive, second half. Attack on three. Rams up 20. Rams to kick off. And Shahid wants it down through the end zone. Take a look at the NFC South to fight for the South. NFL memes. So there are the records in the South. Six teams in history of the league have made the playoffs for the losing record. and could be in that situation 22 and 34 this year lowest win percentage for any division in the NFL this year and that was the case again last season but the big game coming up for them at Tampa next Sunday fighting with Tampa right now for the crown from the 25 Kamara Of course, if you get a division title, you get a wild card home game. You play at home. You can meet a team that might have 11 wins, and you're the home team. So it's big. Tampa did that last year. You do get a little bit lulled to sleep with some of these records to these teams that are in the wild card because you're right. NFC South is always just wide open, at least at this point. Taysom Hill now to take the snap. On second down and five. Hill's going to carry, but not very far. Brought back there, Ernest Jones. Another big night for him. Jones, third-year man out of South Carolina. Picked him in the third round. Back in 21, and Carr comes back in. You know, with his revamped defense that they've been able to build up through the draft and bringing in a few guys through free agency, Jones has become kind of the leader. He's the guy that Raheem Morris figured would eventually become that guy, and he said he's had so much fun watching the third-year linebacker grow into that position. He said he has great instincts and his communication skill just gets better and better. Third and six, and now Carr has to take a timeout. They have come together. It's been a problem for a good part of the season, but starting to blend right now. Stafford, good protection. He floats one. That's incomplete and a flag. You can see Williams was cutting down the sideline, and he got held there by Pete Werner. And Allen's saying, not catchable. Defense, number 20. Ball placed the spot of the foul. Automatic first down. Allen thought the pass not catchable, but it is, and it's a first down. What a great adjustment by Kyron Williams. He sees Stafford make that throw. That's what makes him start to go towards the football. That's an out cut. But him just reacting draws the penalty from Warner. Keep in mind, Warner early in his career at Ohio State was a safety, so he has an ability out in the space to play in coverage. That time he just lost the football. Eleventh play of this drive. Williams picks up a couple. Second down in the goal now, 345. left in the opening quarter. Each team with one possession. The Rams have run the ball six times and thrown it five on this 11-play drive as Sean McVay calls in the plays and Allen calls in the defense. Red zone in the area that Sean McVay it's been pretty good most of the year but the last couple weeks, especially last week, one of three down inside the 20-yard line against the commanders, an area that they want to clean up tonight. Yeah, he blamed himself. Yeah, I saw that. Out of the pistol now. Nakua back and forth he goes Williams gets about a yard yard and a half maybe Saunders makes the tackle third down and goal that cut there by Kyron Williams you go from maybe because there's penetration on that left side you go from maybe a loss at two to being able with that jump cut avoid the contact and still pick up some positive yards so instead of being back at your own five yard line Just his vision, I think his balance and quicks on display quite a bit here on this opening drive. Third and goal trips to the right. Break it here. Nakula in motion. Stafford rolling. Throwing incomplete. Trying to hit Cooper. Cuffey tried to backhand it and couldn't. So once again, the Rams bogged down in the red zone after they'd gone from their own five to the two of the Saints. Yeah, have him stacked there behind Robinson. It's exactly the look that you want. We've seen this so many times from Stafford to Cup. Typically, that's nine and a half out of ten times. That's a touchdown, but they're going to go for it here on fourth down. Fourteenth play in the drive. Crowd, of course, loves it. Easy for them to say. Fourth and goal. Rams go two by two this time, at least for the moment. Now cut. Three by one to the right side. Looks that way. Throws that way. Caught. Nakula. Touchdown. Just a little short of eight minutes was that drive as Puken Nakula, the rookie. First two years at Washington, last two years at Brigham Young takes it in. Yeah, and I love that Matthew Stafford gets his ball out quickly. Last week he may have missed one down close inside the five-yard line where he ended up holding on to it, didn't end up getting sacked. This time gets the ball out of his hands quickly. And good to good, a lot of credit, knowing exactly where he needed to be to get inside the end zone. 50-D of the year, half or six. Extra point is good. They go 95 yards. Tonight's football, only on prime. 7-0, Sean McVay with Koop and Pook and 95 yards they go against that St. defense which had not allowed a touchdown in the last two games Shahid back to receive through the end zone it goes and the Saints take over the 25 so for Derek Carr as you look at the numbers on the first two drives tonight. I mean, he has really been something because he's come out of some games this year watching them. You see him leave and you think he'd be gone for weeks, maybe for the season. It's amazing what he's had to endure, and it's been not a week or two, I mean, almost for most of the season. He's been battling one injury or another. Showed a lot of toughness to his new teammates, that's for sure. Over nine seasons with the Raiders. Five-yard game. I mean, when you look at Carr, they brought him in. It ended pretty ugly. But how he goes about it, how tough he runs, team again feeds off of his energy and his style and the way he plays the game. Three different movements in the shifting and motion, and then a side-on pass to Nakula. And off goes the rookie for a first down. You talk about a guy coming out of nowhere First of all, you draft a guy named Puka You think he's a 5'8 scat back I said 6'2 Built, and he's having a fantastic season Yeah, and you know against the Saints You're going to get a lot of man-to-man That's the big thing Who's going to win the one-on-one matchups? He's caught the ball short of the first down But there's the physicality He's not just a scat back in the slot You mentioned it, 6'2 205, and he's able to break that arm tap Filled by Yadam and pick up the first down. He's a physical receiver. 88 catches leads the team by plenty. Halfway through the quarter. Nice little run here. A five-yard pickup for Kyron Williams. Make it second down and five for Los Angeles. And when I say Stafford's the beneficiary of what Kyron Williams is doing, I'm just saying that this team has an identity. When Sean McVay first came in here and had Jared Goff, it was outside zone, boot off of that play action. At 21 when they won the Super Bowl, Stafford spreading people out, taking shots downfield. Last year, a ton of injuries. Now they have found a new identity with a downhill running game and play action off of that. Extra pressure. Caught on the run. Stafford puts it right on the money to Demarcus Robinson, who's really come along. He's done a great job this year, been around for a while, eighth year in the league, has made some very big catches. Well, with Tutu Atwell down, he really has stepped up, and as you said, give him that third option. The rookie, Nakua, gets so much attention. Cooper Cupp, now that he's healthy, and Demarcus Robinson went from just trying to battle to make the team in camp to now becoming really a pivotal third option when Tutu Atwell is down. two coaches one with a defensive pedigree the other offensive each calling their plays in this situation Sean on offense Allen on defense Stafford to the outside and that is Cooper Cup to the strains of Coop making that grab Alante Taylor covering on the play that's a gain of 12 and another first down how much fun is it to watch Cooper Cup healthy and have it a chance to play again with Matthew Stafford. One-on-one against Taylor. Nobody in the NFL throws that out cut the way Matthew Stafford does. Time to throw. Him and 10 together. Very tough for anybody to hold up one-on-one like that in coverage. Opening drive started back at their own five-yard line. This is play number nine. And a whistle. Prior to the snap. False start. Offense. Number 87. Five-yard penalty. First down. Brad Rogers making that call on the rookie tight end Davis Allen. Davis Allen's stepped up the last few weeks with an opportunity, especially in that Baltimore game, made a big play. And I think he's earned the trust of Stafford and Sean McVay, so he's getting more opportunities. Right now he's a number three tight end behind Higby and Bryson Hopkins. First and 15 from the 18. Cup. Boy, they smelled that one perfectly. Pete Werner is right there. Did not fool him. Third-year guy out of Ohio State for a loss there with three to make it second down, 18. Great awareness, great anticipation. Anytime you see motion with Cooper Cup, you've got to be ready for this. Remember in the Super Bowl the game that you called that was a pivotal play late in that game when they picked up that first down It the exact same play so Werner was ready for it made the play stayed home and showed good fundamentals on that tackle That a phenomenal day of course MVP as the Rams took home the Lombardi on their home turf Second down at 18 Williams, nice hole, he exploits it. Still going. Fights his way to close to the 10-yard line. He's going to make a third down behind the right side of that line with Dotson and Shelton, the center, and Havenstein coming back. He's been hurt. Third down, third and eight. The last two games they have played, they've not allowed a touchdown. But, again, let's keep it in perspective. Nothing against Carolina or the Giants, but they're trying to find themselves, you know, offensively. This is a totally different matchup tonight against Stafford in this offense. But how about the offensive line in this opening drive from the Rams? Line by Trammell. They'll take over the 25. Meanwhile, the NFC playoff picture looks like this. At the moment, San Francisco very much in the driver's seat right now in terms of clinching the West and maybe number one. Dallas is right there. They've clinched a spot. Detroit and for the moment Tampa Bay leading in the south but the two teams meeting next week New Orleans and the Bucs Philly's already in and then as of the moment you got the Vikings and the Rams. Seattle look like they had a chance when we saw them in Dallas you thought okay they're going to be able to bounce back they end up playing Philly and what a game that was for Pete Carroll and his bunch to really save their season and they're right in the thick of things as well. A tremendous win Stafford fires and a four-yard pick up here so Demarcus Robinson gets his number called again fourth time he's been targeted fourth catch Watch these quarterbacks that play the game today to get the ball out of their hands quickly we talked about him playing tennis he had to play baseball with Clayton Kershaw back in the day, back in Dallas growing up And he flips that ball so quick. Again, like most guys, looks like that shortstop turning two. Two-minute warning. Rams 10 Saints, seven on Thursday night football. Rams have it second down and five. Up by three from their own 30-yard line. Two minutes to halftime. Stafford fires, contested and incomplete. Nice coverage there. Cup covered by Jordan Howden, rookie out of Minnesota. They picked him in the fifth round. How about this for a tough ask? Look at the depth that Howden has. He's about 8 or 10 yards deep against Cooper Cup. Gives him that beautiful inside move, but there's the length. Howden steps up and makes the play to be able to separate that football. He's in for Marcus May, and he had to step in early in the year for him, and now he's showing the ability to do that as well. That's a rookie on an island against Cooper Cup. Played it well. Also minus Lattimore is still on the injured list. Third down and five from the 30-yard line. Look out. Down he goes. Pressure that time. Carl Granderson. You got Elante Taylor who is the first guy in there. See if they give each a half a second lead. Fourth down. This is a key here. What can you do against Stafford? You've got to disguise the pressure. Blitz comes here, and then you drop the backers here. Confuse the offensive line. Nobody picks up Taylor. Kyron Williams tries to step up and help out. It forces Matthew Stafford up, and then the rest of that defensive line is able to collapse the pocket on Stafford for that big sack. So often you see the defense steps up to their own offense with a big play. They get a three and out. They get the ball back now to Derek Carr. And call the timeout. Still at 148, two timeouts. Ethan Evans, the rookie out of Wingate Division II school in North Carolina, seventh-round pick. And Rasheed Shahid, who got free for that touchdown, ready to run it back to the camp from his own 25-yard line. Gets it away. Angle kick Going out of bounds on the far side Near the Rams bench We'll see where they spot it They'll get it back And we'll be back in 30 seconds They kick only 39 yards And again, kicking's been a problem For both of these teams Short punt Ball at the 35-yard line Two timeouts and 141 on the clock Over the middle And into Rams territory was Chris Olabe. What an opportunity here for the Saints at the end of this half. The way this game looked when it was 10-0. Rams had the football and now they're moving into Rams territory. Short gain here. That's Shahid making that catch. Block running down 115 and ticking. Second and five. Carr seeing it very clean right now. getting the ball out of his hands very fast. Extra pressure gets it away. In the traffic there. As Shahid going to the ground. Ernest Jones put the pressure on that time. It'll be third down, third and five. Raheem Morris done a great job on that defensive side. Defensive coordinator. Coach Tampa Bay a number of years ago. Interim coach in Atlanta. Puts a lot on a defense to make sure they're in position and they're not going to blow an assignment. Davis back in. That commission with a couple of plays. Served down in two, four minutes to the half. And that pass is incomplete. Intended for Kup, a little out of his range. So it'll be fourth down in two. Kup has had a few where he's had a chance to get his hands on it, hadn't come up with it. This time that ball is low, and you can see he's still kind of feeling that On that shoulder, on that left side, he's just very, seems very sensitive. But the Saints get a stop there on that third down. Now, Habersick, this will be a 47-yard field goal attempt. And you've got a whistle that sounded like before the snap, but no. Maybe out of the stands. Missed it. Nothing new here. Wide left remains 10-zip. 7 out of 12 for 75 yards. After Havrasek missed that 47-yarder, it remains 10-0. And they start this drive from the 37-yard line. and that pass along the sideline is pulled in Jawan Johnson makes that catch Ernest Jones put the pressure on so you know anytime you succeed a legend even though it was two years since Drew Brees retired I mean the crowd the fans expect especially for a veteran so much from him not like a rookie replacing Brady when they picked up Mac Jones but you know it's been tough and there's Drew speaking of the legend Yeah, pretty good. Drew Brees. And I think that move really showed how they were kind of going all in to try to get this thing turned. And it's been a tough, it's been a bumpy road, not just with the injuries, getting booed at times, you know, in his own stadium. So he's a big fella. At the 45-yard line, you got Aaron Donald right there. Just the Patriots had one year with Cam Newton came in, and then, you know, they drafted Jones. But you don't expect a rookie as they say to supplant a legend now, but we know you know they they made the trade all these years in the league What Drew's thinking these days Knowing him he's probably asking if he could have a helmet back out there second and 12 Carr, time, deep, going deep and open and making the catch. Shahid for the touchdown. He beats Witherspoon. And as we said before, he's about as fast as anybody in the league. Case in point, 45 yards. Boy, do they need that. Great response. The game started to feel like it was teetering a bit. It felt like the field was starting to slant, and Drew's obviously excited to see that big play. And they had some negative plays. They were getting behind the sticks. After that play by Aaron Donald, you thought, uh-oh, here we go again. And they come back with a great call, and what great execution there with Carr hitting Shahid. Blake Grupy, the rookie from Notre Dame. So they get the TD after the missed field goal. Down the field they go. You're going to get a deep post right here. actually, watch how they work the safety. Trying to get a feel for what Jordan Fuller's going to do. He bites up on that crosser, so now you've got the deep post over the top. He's simply making the read on Fuller. If Fuller would have sank and appreciated the respect of that deep throw, he's got the underneath throw. Instead, this opens up because Fuller bites on that crosser, and there is a perfectly thrown football and a big play for this Saints offense. Yeah, so true what you said because it was beginning to tilt, and it felt like the Rams could be leading more than 10-0, bogged down a couple of times, and right now it's a three-point game. Yeah, and again, we talked about in the open what's at stake for these two teams and what it's taken for them to get to the point of being 7-7, and there was a lot on the line here, and you do not want to dig yourself a hole and kind of have that, oh, no, here we go kind of feeling, And so that was a great answer that time by Carr in this offense. Get him right back in the game. Each team controls its own path to the playoffs. A loss doesn't eliminate a team, but it makes it a lot harder for the loser of this game. This kick is going to be returnable, but it's a fair catch call for it to six yards out. Well, that defense, one of the reasons that, you know, the Rams are where they are right now. And that's why the expectations, I think, for this team were not very high coming into the season. You had Stafford coming off an injury. You had Kyron Williams had not emerged. You had a defense with only, as I say, three starters from last year who even came back. And, of course, Aaron Donald and Jones being two of them. The others on the practice squad. But they have melded. They have blended beautifully. It's part of the reason they had the Rams are one of those teams that have certainly exceeded expectations to this point. Yeah, especially in the back end. Think about where they were with Jalen Ramsey and David Wong and Troy Hill and Nick Scott and Taylor Rapp. That's just on the back end. You know, Bobby Wagner was here a year ago. I mean, it's just a completely different defensive group with the exception of, as you said, just a couple guys. Third down and six. from the 29 extra pressure pass is caught to keep that drive going they go to the tight end Foster Moreau for a first down so third down conversion for the Saints and they bring Jones this time on this blitz trying to be able to get home they also bring yeast so you get two one's a safety one's a backer picked up nicely by Camara so they try to create some confusion and some doubt for that offensive line. They give him just enough time and a good job by Carr. Looking through that pressure, downfield to the big tight end for the first down. End around. Shahid picks up a couple. You know you were talking before, Kirk, about how quickly so many of the quarterbacks are getting rid of the ball under three seconds and some at 2.3 or so. So who are the most frustrated people in the world? Defensive linemen. Every week, right? We talk to these guys. And, you know, Aaron Donald is talking this week with us about the frustrations. It's not just the ball getting out fast, but he said, you know, usually I'm double-teamed, sometimes triple-teamed. So it does free it up for Byron Young and others, as we've seen tonight, have to win one-on-one battles. Kobe Turner as well. Had a big sack before. Second and six. Pass to the outside is Errant. Kamara, the intended receiver. You had John Johnson blitzing from the secondary. That's probably third down and six with eight and a half to go in the third. You know, they hit Alave early in the game. The first quarter, he had four targets and four receptions. And he's been relatively quiet from that point on. He still is up to six catches on the night. But you get into these critical moments, your best players, they've got to win. They've got to make, especially against Mann, and you've got to get some separation here. Raheem Morris got a smile out of the official. Third and six. Carr steps up. Carr fires. It's picked off at the 40-yard line. Intercepted there by Jordan Fuller, and he takes it to the Saints 40-yard line. Number four picks off number four, and the Rams get it on the turnover. Al, he just hides in coverage here. He just doesn't locate him. He thinks it's man-to-man, guys working across the field. He just doesn't locate Jordan Fuller. Jordan Fuller just sitting there as a robber, just kind of sinks down. He's reading the eyes of Derek Carr, and he just never locates him, throws it right into his hands. And unfortunately for Derek Carr, That's been something that has creeped up from time to time throughout his career, especially on those third downs. First turnover in the game. Of course, when you lose it on a fourth down, it doesn't count as a turnover, but in essence, it's the same thing. Here's Nakula. Around the end, he goes and slides out of bounds after a pick of it at about six. Rams are in what we would call 11 personnel almost every snap with one tight end and one back, three receivers but what's interesting is with these receivers and the way they block you see the numbers from Derek Carr against the Rams but the way they block, it really is still a very versatile attack in what they're able to do with that personnel Carr has seen enough of the Rams. One TD, eight picks in his career. Meanwhile, the pass is caught by Cut. Able to stay inbounds long enough to secure the first down tackle there by Taylor. I thought it was that we talked to McVean. I said, man, you guys do a lot of 11-person. He said, you know, if you look at Nakua, the rookie, it threw the end zone. So we talked about the picks that they made and that defense. Only three starters from last year returned. So you've got Les Snead, who has traded away tons of draft picks. Brandon Cooks, and they traded there for Jalen Ramsey from that. Stafford, of course, and the Goff trade with Detroit. Paid off for them third time. Team went six-plus years, got a first-round pick. Go back to when George Allen was at Washington over the Hill Gang. and there is Les who I tell you what, that scouting department has done some job in these late rounds Carr throws caught, sliding down, making the grab 39 yard line is Olavi who's been the man of the moment tonight, and we'll see it again five catches for him, and now when you think about that, you lose the first round picks, you think you know, everybody gets caught up in that, but think about the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the sixth round picks. I don't know if anybody's done as good a job as Les Snead and Sean McVay with some of the picks that they've made. You're seeing Byron Young out here playing. Go back to Ernest Jones when they picked him up. Looking at secondary Russ Yeast, Quentin Lake, Kobe Durant. They've picked up guys that can help Kobe Turner, the defensive tackle. First down, rolling, throwing. And that pass incomplete here. That's Shahid covered there by Kobe Durant. Yeah, so there are some of the notable players third round or later. You've got Cupp, Jones, Kobe Durant, Kyron Williams in the fifth round. Look at that. Yep. Kobe Turner, he made that sack before, leaves the team in sacks, and, of course, the Kua. Yeah, I mean, all these names right here at this point in the season, those are impact players making a difference for this team. The draft is a crapshoot. We know that. And sometimes you get a good run late in the night. You know what I mean. Jamal Williams out to the 45-yard line. Leg down. They're going to hold. The only second penalty of the night. Holding. Offense. Number 67. 10-yard penalty. Second down. Yeah, that's Landon Young. He's playing because Ryan Ramchick is hurt and inactive tonight. Really good move by Michael Hoyt from outside back to the inside. Surprised at 67. He steps out, and I think that sudden movement from a 300-pounder forces him to grab on, and Hoyt's effort still trying to work for the football. Second and 20. They just showed Shohan or Tony up on the upper floor. Show you Tony. Now they're a Dodger, and that's the reason for the cheering. Pass is incomplete to the outside. Nobody was home. That went off third down. You live in Los Angeles. You and I talk baseball. It seems like every time we're together. How excited is Los Angeles to have him? He's been in Anaheim, and now he's a Dodger. Well, they're more excited if you're a Dodger fan than an Angels fan. Of course. It's been all those years where the Angels couldn't make the playoffs. I mean, you had two generational players in Mike Trout and that man right there. So, you know, going to take his talents up to Chavez Ravine. Signed a decent contract. You think? Yeah. Did pretty well. Third down and 20. Draw play. Trying to pick up a little something. And next to nothing there is Kamara. Gets taken down. So, that penalty sent them back into no man's land. And it's fourth and 19. Yeah. In the first couple times the Saints had the ball, they were able to move the football. Carr just took some bad sacks on third downs, and now they're way back, as he said, because of that penalty. This is not an offense on the road on a short week. You want to get behind by more than 10 points right now. So much at stake for both these teams. Headley sends that one toward the sideline, bounces and takes a good ram bounce coming backwards and gets down there by the Saints at the 32-yard line. With 8-21 left in the half to Santa Monica Pier on this Thursday night, Rams lead the Saints 10-0. A lot of times, like most teams, you double-team. The problem is, on third downs, letting others get one-on-one opportunities. There's a blitz by Jones on a third down. I'll tell you, this rookie, Kobe Turner, gets better and better. And if you double-team 99, 91 is going to win on the inside with that quickness and those heavy hands. He had a sack, the second possession. After the 39-yard punt, Rams start this drive from their own 32-yard line. This is the back. Fourth and five. Crowd responds in time. Four-man rush. Carver is going to get sacked at the 49-yard line, and that's the end of that drive. Colby Turner, the rookie at a Wake Forest. Third round pick gets the sack, and the Rams take over at midfield a minute and a half into the second. As usual at the trough. Probably has as big a heart as he does, you know, as big as he is as just a master of human. Love working with him. Love it. From the 48-yard line, the Rams begin this drive play action. Stafford, good protection. Fires wide open over the middle. Nakua to the 25-yard line. And he goes. Stopped there by Jordan Howden. And again, you got play action. You got Sean McVay using the pre-snap movement again with Nakua. Moving from the right to the left. Affected communication. You cleared out with Cup. And now you just settle in right behind those linebackers. What a throwing lane. What a great job with the rhythm and the route that time by the rookie. And, of course, Stafford makes that look so easy. 28 yards there. Stafford already 96 yards. passing. It's the Rams' second possession. Keep it on the ground. A little hesitation there. And moving that pile a little bit. The ball comes out at the end, but it was blown dead. We were kind of kidding with Stafford on our call at the end. We just asked him, what kind of cardio? Are you a clean eater? He's 35 and he looks 25. I don't know if he's ever looked as good in his career as he's looked these last four weeks. And I know he won the Super Bowl two years ago, but my point is this guy right now is seeing the field, working through progressions, and is in as good a shape as he's been in his career. He ain't no vegan either. He loves his steak. Second and six. Stafford to the outside. Open there. First down. Cooper cut. Inside the 10 to Kaylee. Well, and Kirk, when you mentioned to McVay how good Stafford's looking at 35. He told us that his quarterback took up tennis this offseason, and now he's running around the pocket like Grand Slam champ Carlos Alcaraz. I talked to his wife, Kelly, before the game. She actually started playing last year. Then Matthew joined her. She said, there were some fights on the court. They're both a little competitive. And, of course, Matthew stepped out there and was good immediately. Yeah, just a tad. First and goal from the nine. Tyron Williams. It's about half the distance. Second down. I really think from where they were two years ago, and they climbed the mountain, win the Super Bowl, to losing guys like Witt in so many great pieces on this offense, they had to rebuild it. He got injured last year. Gives Sean McVay a lot of credit for reinventing themselves offensively. And I think Matthew Stafford at this point in the season is confident in the guys around him, loves the energy of the youth in some of these pieces, and is having a ball playing with them. It's infectious. Second down and goal from the six-yard line. Williams to the outside. Williams fighting to the two-yard line. So the Rams, of course, two years ago, they mortgaged the house. Remember, they built this stadium, as Stan Kroenke did, $5 billion. They opened it up in 2020. COVID. First game, there's Les Snead, who's done a great job as the GM. COVID, the first game ever played here is a Sunday night game. No crowd against Dallas. There they are, the two Super Bowl champions, 99 and 2021. No huddle here. And then Cooper Cup. No, just out of his reach. Covered by Taylor there. Fourth down and goal. And again, that would have been a great catch. We're just so spoiled when you see Cooper Cup and Matthew Stafford. He dropped one earlier. You thought he would catch this one. That would have been a big-time catch. But again, because it's 10, you're thinking, no problem. Bring that one down. So now they've got to bring in the field goal unit. kicking's been a problem for both of these teams this year Britt Maher was here they got rid of him they brought in Lucas Haversick they took a look at Mason Crosby for a while but Haversick won the job a couple of weeks ago so he'll kick right now from the 10 yard it'll be a 21 yard field goal attempt from the 11 Ethan Evans will hold it and the kick is perfect so the Rams take advantage after they get it on downs at midfield. 10-23 to go to the half. And the Rams lead it over the Saints. 10-0. Nothing is the score, Ethan Evans, who is their punter and kickoff man, sends that one. Like any quarterback and really any offense, when the offensive line gets better, you're going to see better production from Derek Barr. And I think it's, you and I had him in Jacksonville game about week seven. Think about how much they've improved up front. And I think that's resulted in so much more improvement as an offense. Barr takes the snap. Hill is also in the game as a receiver. And that pass is incomplete inside the 30-yard line. Intended for Jawan Johnson. Ernest Jones covering on the play. Jones is one of only three starters of last year who were on the team this season on defense. That's right. And one guy we all know about is 99. And every call that we made this week, everybody from New Orleans said, we're going to ID 99 on every play. That time Ruiz left a long one-on-one. Even though it was a quick throw, still is able to. Third down and seven now. Jamal Williams comes into the game. Last year with the Lions, at over 1,000 yards, had 17 rushing touchdowns. Carr on the drop. Carr gets sacked. So a good start to this drive. Three successive first downs. That time, Ernest Jones, who can play in coverage, can also blitz, comes in for the sack. It's fourth and 13. Well, they'd love to get five to create the one-on-one opportunities. Here is Jones right here, but here's a rookie to keep an eye on as well, and Kobe Turner. Watch him win. Jones ends up getting home, but Turner also impacting that pass rush. Great job up front. Lou Headley, the 30-year-old rookie, grew up in Australia. He'll do the punting. Austin Trammell stands inside his 10-yard line. Nose down, put some backspin on it. Fair catch call for made at the five-yard line. So they run off eight plays, then punt, and here comes Stafford and the Rams. Prime video. Rams will start from their own five-yard line. And the first offensive play of the night, Kyron Williams, is the running back. That's Cooper Cup in motion. And here's Williams averaging over five yards per carry. so Matthew Stafford came here in 2001 let him do a Super Bowl after a dozen seasons in Detroit last four games take a look at that 3-1 the only loss was in overtime at Baltimore 12 touchdowns one pick go back to week 8 when he had that injury to his thumb and misses a game and ends up coming back and since then as you said has been on fire are playing as well as anybody in the league. Second and three. They use a ton of motion. The Rams do. A little floater that's caught on the outside here by Tyler Higby. The tight end pulls his way down the sideline out to close to the 35-yard line in the first down. Joe Woods, the defensive coordinator's biggest fear is eye discipline against his offense is Sean McVay because of the eye candy. Motion, a little thing like that can affect who's got who. So you go from pre-snap having a good idea. They motion to the other side. And now Higby ends up getting free out in the flat left all alone, busting coverage. 22-yard gain. Cup is in the slot. Puganakua that number 17 in motion going back and forth a little flip here to Kyron Williams He breaks tackles and he does that a lot and takes it out to the 38 guard line where Colin Sanders stops him there for a gain of four Tough runner. Tough runner. I think the team feeds off of his energy between the wide receiver's ability to block and willingness to block and how tough of a runner Kyron Williams is, that's become the identity of the Rams offense. So we can talk about Stafford in the last four weeks, what he's done. I think he's been a beneficiary of what this new identity is and how balanced they've become. There's your late motion. Stafford looks that way, then throws over the middle, and that pass is incomplete. intended for Cooper. Everybody's always talking about you use the run to set up the pass. And of course, when you have somebody like Kyron Williams, who's really come out of nowhere, he's fourth in the league in rushing despite missing four games. Had he played in those games and had normal days, he'd be right up there with Christian McCaffrey near the top. That's a great point, Al. And you never know, a guy goes from college to the pros, how he'll respond. I watched him play a lot in Notre Dame. Very similar, not just results, A couple different plays down in this area for Cooper Cup, but he's had two drops. It very easily could have been touchdowns, and that's usually his go-to man down in this area for obvious reasons with the experience they have together and the chemistry they have. But they have a lot of different options. Nakua also can win one-on-one. Yeah, he did before. He's wide to the right. Cup is in the slot to the right. Nakua scored the Rams' only touchdown. You've got Tyron Williams set out wide to the left. You've got Kup in motion. Stafford looking one way, then the other. Throws caught! Demarcus Robinson having a night of nights. Touchdown. So they bring in Robinson. You've got Kup. You've got Nakula. You've got Tutu Atwell, who's been hurt. You bring this guy in as an extra guy, and all he's done tonight is catch six for 82 yards. And again, I think it just shows you the offense for Sean McVay and how it's grown around Stafford. It's not just Cooper Cup. It's not just Nakua. It's Tyron Williams, and now we've seen Demarcus Robinson in recent weeks give Stafford more options. Four touchdowns for Robinson all over the last seven games now. Extra point is good by Havrasek. and so the Saints go for it from the 42, turn it over on downs, and the Rams go right down the field, and it only takes them 35 seconds. Yeah, usually when you see that motion, it's a good indicator they're going to go out to the right flat. He looked that way. It was taken away, and this is pretty good coverage on this slant. By 27, you had him, but what a throw. The placement of that football, see him looking right, comes back, as almost an outlet, puts it up in the air where 15 can climb, and it's away from the defenders. So if he doesn't make the catch, it's an incompletion. John McVay is loving that right there. Meanwhile, you've got that drop right here. That would have been a first down. Could have continued the drive. That came on third down. Couldn't convert on fourth down. Olave dropping it right there. Robinson, well, he's living the dream. And he's been on the other side of Mahomes. Lamar Jackson. And now he's got Stafford. And he's found a nice little home here. Stafford tonight when he's thrown to Robinson, Nakua, and Higby. Think about this. Robinson, Nakua, and Higby. He's 13 for 13 for 171 yards and two touchdowns. This is Stafford, 199 total yards. Rams are going to get the ball to start the second half in effect. They're going for the only two for one. 21 seconds. But what it's worth, the Saints have two timeouts. Then they get them into field goal range here. Carr's going to try. Carr's going to throw, and that pass is incomplete. Try to get it to Shahid. That would figure second and 10, 15 ticks left. Yeah, you got two guys that can get downfield in a hurry. And even with the clock down, at any moment, they can make a play. We already saw Shahid. Of course, we keep calling it for Alave, who's known for his ability to make plays vertically as well. Taysom Hill is going to come in. and they're just going to take a knee right here and forget about it to the locker room they go as the first half comes to an end Matthew Stafford 16-22 199 passing yards two touchdowns 10 point lead Rams to get the second half kickoff. And a big, big game for both teams and their playoff hopes. Both teams know how important this game is. Matthew Stafford came into tonight with 12 touchdown passes in the previous four games. Carr is going to get sacked, and that's the end of that drive. Our backs are against the wall. Carr going deep and open and making the catch. Shahid for the touchdown. Stafford throws, caught. Touchdown. So it is 17. Well, Sean, you put up 17 points and only punted once in the first half. What do you need to carry over to the second? Same thing. You know, we've got to be able to execute. We'd like to see a little bit more efficiency in our run game. We've got to do a good job of making those kicks if we're in range on that. Like the way our defense is playing, they've got some big stops. We've just got to prevent giving up the explosive, but we've got to play four quarters. What did you tell your team at the half about the importance of closing this one out? Just that. Let's just continue to stay in the moment one play at a time. Let's go finish this thing. All right, the two quarterbacks. You've got Carr who threw for 163. Stafford threw for 199 and two touchdowns. Ten-point game. Each team controlling its own playoff fate at this point. 8-7-7. Rams to get it to start the second half. fair catch call for at the three yard line they'll start at the 25 time now for tonight's journey which is being presented by Hyundai so Demarcus Robinson six catches in the first half for 82 yards and a touchdown and some really big grabs 45 yard TD catch there by Shahid 7 of 40 or more yards this season the Rams the problem's been giving up that explosive play, and they gave one there, and there's the quarterback comparison for you. Rams with that opportunity to close out the first half for that touchdown and now start the second half with another big opportunity. Let's see if the Saints defense can step up here. Play action, don't get pressure on Stafford. Down the sideline goes the pass. It's a little short, and Nakula comes back. Did he hold on? No, he didn't. Well, maybe they say he did. He held on, and they're going to give him the catch, at least for the moment until the Rams get up there in a hurry and make sure they don't challenge this. So did he hold on? He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He goes down and that's a catch. A catch. And the Rams do get it off before any challenge can be made to begin with. So here you go again. What a play. Adebo is there. Taylor are both there. Somehow he's able to grab it, secure it. And end the play. And Terry, what do you see? That looks like a complete catch, right? It is, Kirk. He gains control of the ball. And he has it very much long enough to perform that counter of the game. And then he finally loses it there at the end. This is absolutely a catch. By the time he loses it, he's already considered down. So, obviously, that is a catch. And a big play. He got hit, by the way, right as he let that ball out of his hands. Absolutely. Second down and six. Look at Williams. Tyron Williams to the 21-yard line. It's the Rams' first first down by rushing tonight. And time out here. It's Williams. Tyron Williams. Yeah. Helmet off. Taking a look at him. He missed four games earlier this season with injuries. And they work on him with alacrity. Injury timeout. Good report ASAP on him. Yeah, and he has been, we talked all game about how important he has been to this offense and the spark that he has provided. Hopefully he'll get looked at and be able to come back. So now Ronnie Rivers just activated. Last couple of days, he is the running back. He stays in the block. Stafford throws, and in a wide open, the coup of it misses him. That time he had the pressure put on by Pete Werner. Heat up the middle, but Stafford couldn't find the open man at second and ten. Yeah, the blitz comes here. Good pickup, but watch to the outside with 17 to the right. Watch this little push at the top of the route. That's the physicality that he has. Again, big 6'2 wide receiver, and that's the part of the game that he loves, is to be able to usually you see it with blocking. This time he's just able to separate and get away from Taylor. and what did the Saints catch a break there? Stafford had plenty of time to be able to make that throw. Rams scored a break too because Williams is back in the game. Stafford, he went down hard. Looked to be in a lot of pain. Stafford now to the outside again and that pass is incomplete in the end zone. That's a Debo covering on the play intended for Nakula. It'll be third down and ten. Well, he's going to work from the left to the right. You see so much pre-snap movement with Sean McVay's offense trying to create matchups. The Saints don't run with him, but it's still man-to-man, one-on-one. Ball's under thrown a bit. And Adebo never really locates the football, and that's the reaction you hear from the crowd. But I think that's a good no-call there on that second down. Third and ten. Pass, cut Touch it back, first net He'll be interviewed in this offseason He sure should be The job he's done with this defense He's been remarkable with all the youth See if Olave can get freed up He's matched up one-on-one with Kobe Durant On the right side Carr fires and drops Olavi was right there. Had a first down for sure instead. It's a fourth down and five with a minute to play. Motion him back into the backfield. And watch because of the route in front of him. He's able to get behind that and get some separation. Just the ball got on him so quickly. Just didn't give Olavi a chance to make that catch for the first down. Allen's going to go for it. At least line up to go for it on a fourth down and five. for 60 seconds. And off they go, and that pass is incomplete. So once again, you got Ernest Jones put the pressure on. That took only four seconds off the clock. The Rams get it back near midfield, and the Rams have all three timeouts. And on fourth down, Carr's trying to hold this ball as fast as he can, but the pressure that comes from his right from 53, he's able to walk around Jamal Williams, doesn't do a good job of picking it up. Carr holds it as long as he can and floats it into the air. But he had to get rid of it so quickly. Johnson never knew the ball was even thrown. So that's the second time that the Rams have held him. Turnover on downs. They have it at the 42-yard line first down. Four-man rush. Deep drop. Pump fake. scrambles throws against the grain down the sideline caught Demarcus Robinson what a night he's having kept the drive alive the play alive as a 32 yard pickup you'll see the play eventually off to the far left and what happens is right out here you end up just losing looking back at the quarterback and losing who you have in man coverage Adam just lost him allowed Robinson to get down that left sideline. He's in great position here. This is where you want to just kind of plaster the receiver. But you can't look back at the quarterback because you get lost. It looked like Robinson came close to stepping out of bounds. He did. But. Take a look at it. No challenges within two minutes. Stayed in. First time out for the Rams. 45 seconds now. Ball to 26 Stafford's throwing for 180 yards in this half To the sideline Caught and then Taking out of bounds right there Is Tyler Higby by Elante Taylor Short gain 40 seconds Gain of 4 second and 6 That pre-snap movement gave him a chance to get out in the flat. It's almost like a check down, but they get positive yards. Get out of bounds. Stafford fires caught inside the 15. Nakula. He takes it to the 11-yard line. Adevo makes the tackle. Stafford knew exactly where he wanted to go with that football. Looks left, kind of moves the backer, and comes right back into the middle of that defense and throws an absolute rope right on time for the first. Second timeout taken by the Rams. We'll wrap up our schedule of games on Thursday nights. Next week we go to Cleveland. Big game for the Browns with a record of 9-5, taking on the New York Jets in Cleveland. 7 o'clock Eastern time for TNF tonight. Kickoff at 8.15. We talked a lot tonight about the NFC, the wild card, so wide open. Look at the AFC, what the Colts have done, the Bengals, with Jake Browning, obviously the Browns with Flacco. What an incredible story to see who's going to emerge there to get those three spots. From the 11, again, the Rams bogging down of late in that red zone, and here they are again. First and 10. Nice moves. Tyron Williams inside the 5, second down. Shows you the confidence they have in this running game, and this offensive line and how far they have come up front. Sean McVay, you would think, okay, he's going to throw the ball with Stafford, but instead they get the blocking angles that they need and some good positive yards, and they end up using that last time out. So 25 seconds. It'll be second and three. They can get a first down without a touchdown. And he has been able to design a cut. The Raiders last year benched the last two games, don't even show up. Sent them to New Orleans. He said, you know, one of the things that gets back with Dennis Shatlin, who was his first coach in Oakland when they drafted him, and he started to talk about Taysom Hill the other day. You know, sometimes, hey, another guy takes a lot of your snaps. He says, no, that was one of the things I wanted to come here for. Fires, and going to the ground and making the grab right there is Rasheed Shahid for a first down. Another example with the timing. I just happened to be watching that route live in the coverage, and Shahid, he sold that like he was going downfield with that speed and gave him the cushion to be able to come back. And by the time he started to work back on that route, ball was in the air. So that's not something that we saw a lot of when we had him week seven against Jacksonville. And I think another example of just the timing and how far it's come. Now you've got Hill. Takes it. Hands it off. Inside give. Just across the 50-yard line goes Jamal Williams. When the season started, Camaro was suspended. Personal conduct violation for the first three games. So they picked up Williams, who was in Detroit. This is a guy at 17 rushing touchdowns and over 1,000 yards in Detroit. He said, no, no, we're going to draft Gibbs. He's free to go. Yeah, that was a shocker, right? I think a lot of people thought with what Detroit was building. but obviously they knew what they were doing, picking up Gibbs. They have a nice one-two tandem there in Detroit now themselves. Second and six. Carr. Pass is incomplete. Coverage was good. That time he tried to get it into Boston Moreau. The tight end, Michael Hoyt, covering on the play. Third down and six for the Saints. This is a good play here for the Saints to try to figure out, okay, we got Aaron Donald. We know that they move him around from time to time. We know that Raheem Morris does a good job with stunts and twists and games to create one-on-one matchups. Sometimes we'll bring Ernest Jones to create that fifth pass rusher. The way we saw earlier, Jones has walked up now over that right guard. Donald all the way over to the left tackle. Third and six. And he still gets doubled. And that pass is caught, held onto, and just enough for a first down. Olave making the grab. Quentin Lake makes the tackle there in the waning seconds of the opening quarter. Yeah, James Hurst has the assignment initially, but you're right. McCoy, the center, will work to his left. Wherever Donald is is where that center is sliding, just in case, to be able to help out. And they gave Carr enough time. Again, they go back to Olave with the underneath throws because he's such a threat downfield. He's got a nice cushion. and that's the second time they've been able to pick up a first down on an empty throw to Olave. He's got four. That's the end of the quarter. The score is ramps to the roof at SoFi Stadium in Englewood. Second quarter, Al Michaels, Kirk Herbstreit, Kaylee Hartung. First down for the Saints. And this is Kamara going next to nowhere. Second down. Their running game with Kamara, obviously, he's an X-factor. You want to get him in space. Listen, they've been running the football better in recent weeks. And I think with Pete out in the left tackle and Hurst at guard, McCoy, Ruiz, and, you know, Ramchick is out, but Landy Young in. They've got better continuity, and I think it's impacted not just pass protection, but the run game to set up the pass for cards. Much like the Rams, I think if you get better up front, you get better results. 78 career touchdowns for them, most ever by a Saint. That's Camara making the catch. and they'll spot it just inside the 40-yard line. So Kamara making that grab right there. His first catch of the night, he's carried four times for 12 yards. He's got a third down coming up, third and five. Well, they've been finding the Lave. He has four targets in that first quarter and four receptions coming off the ankle where he missed last week, and they're moving him around. He's now off to the right in the slot, matched up against the second-year man, Quinton Lake. Tar, six for his first eight. Throws, and that's incomplete. Coverage was tight. Quentin Lake is right there covering Olabe and setting up a 4,000-5. So he goes back to him again, and I'll tell you what, man. Toby Durant has been playing some nickel, and I think they've been very impressed with the length of Quentin Lake, And I think he's settling in at that spot to give them even more diversity in what they're able to do on the back end. He's playing well in recent weeks. Saints are going to go for it. Line up to go for it anyway. Jamal Williams. Three on each team. Going to have to snap it. He said easy, easy. Look at the clock. Time here boys. Yeah, take it all the way. You better relax It's gonna take a time out too when they get down to one second And there is your time out And once again next week we will wrap up our second season of coverage on Prime Video as the Jets go to Cleveland. Miles Garrett and company, that Browns team, 9-5. Got to hand it to them, man. I mean, you know, they lose Watson, they lose running back. I mean, it's like that's a season that looked like it was going to go down early. Here they are at 9-5. this game is over. I mean, all you've got to do is run a play here. It's going to take three, four seconds, and you don't have to snap another play. It was over when the touchdown, too. Yeah. In a manner of speaking. The great thing about you is you definitely get my drift. I'm too sure. Oh, yeah. Stafford will take a knee. Help his lineman up to his feet. Shelton. And the clock will run down. And Mr. Sean McVeigh and company get to above 500. Eight wins. Seven losses. Saints, now they have to go home and just hope that the Jaguars can beat Tampa. and they all have the same record and maybe Atlanta loses. Who knows? Could be a three-way tie going into next week. You just don't know. Tampa could be in the driver's seat if they win their game against Jacksonville. A lot of stuff at play here as we head down the stretch of the 2023 season. Four straight games, two or more TD passes, no picks. First player in the illustrious history of this franchise. We've seen a lot of good quarterbacks. In fact, it's learning opportunities. Olave his last reception for 28 yards so he's over a hundred tonight in receiving yards of 104 and what does that do to a Kyron Williams when his head coach says hey I got your back I still believe in you when you make a couple mistakes and he was beating himself up after the game I can't that can't happen yeah can't put it behind me I gotta get I gotta be better you always that you You know, he's averaging close to 100 yards a game on the ground. As we said before, he'd be right up with McCaffrey for the lead lead had he not missed those four games and played normally. Carr throws, caught. Should be a first down with Kirkwood, who scored a touchdown last week. See where they spotted very close to a first at the 37-yard line. Well, this Saints team has faced so much adversity throughout this year, and the one thing they like to talk to you about is how resilient they have been. and they're going to get another test tonight, obviously, down 20 here on the road against a team that's playing some pretty good football. Dennis Allen believes that, you know, with the vets, the team that's been through a lot in their careers, that they keep believing and keep giving themselves a chance. This will be a big possession to get them believed that they can come back into this game. Kamara. Inside the 35-yard line. Three and a half remaining and a little skirmish breaks out. And with the exception of the big touchdown to Shahid, you've seen the Rams and Raheem Morris do a pretty good job of just trying to keep everything in front. Not giving them the easy touchdown. Make them be consistent. Make them have to execute the link to the field as opposed to giving up those explosives. Second and seven. Good protection. Fire to the outside, incomplete. 10 there for Olavi, covered by zero. Byron Young having a nice season. Rookie out of Tennessee, third-round pick. Think about Young. You think about him setting the edge against the run or his ability to rush the quarterback this year with six sacks, and you'd rarely see him out in the flat trying to cover a receiver. His fleet floated is Alave, so that was a missed opportunity that time by Derek Carr in the Saints offense with Alave out there with some space. Third and seven. Play clock at three. Carr throws. Caught. What are they going to say now? That's Olave right there. And he's going to set up a fourth and seven. Hits him right in the chest here, Al. He just drops the ball. He would have been short anyway. He's well short on the route of picking up that first down. Keep in mind, he missed last week with the ankle. The touchdown that he scored against Carolina forced him to miss last week. Just does not look like the same Chris Olave tonight. Yeah. Went to him early and often. Targeted 11 times. He's caught seven. Bar throws. Caught. Can he get to the first down? Marker. He juggles and he cannot. Jawan Johnson, the tight end. So once again, for the third time tonight, the Saints have gone for it on fourth down. Don't convert. Rams get it. Up by. He brought Wade Phillips in to coach the defense. Seven years. He's 37 years old. He's still the youngest coach in the league. After seven seasons. And a new daddy, Ian Veronica. Had a baby boy about three months ago. Burning the midnight oil. Occasionally up for the 2 o'clock feeding. Whole new appreciation. Oh, yeah. For what moms do, right? Absolutely. It's Ronnie Rivers. So, your flag is down. Penalty. Penalty free game. Number 89. Ten-yard penalty. per fell. That's only the fourth accepted penalty tonight. Refreshing. Tyler Higbee. There it is. So the longest streaks is the youngest head coach. John Gruden and it was McVay who was an assistant wide receivers coach for Gruden in Tampa Bay in 08. And then John Madden who when we talked to Sean about this yesterday, he guessed that Madden was number one. Couldn't believe Gruden was number one. And he could be number one next year unless let's say Maybe Ben Johnson gets a job. Yeah. He'd be a younger. The very highly heralded offensive coordinator of the Lions right now. First and 20 after the penalty. Rivers. Mal Williams. And the only loss during that period would be to Baltimore. What a great game. Like overtime. And the Rams had a lot of chances to win. Couldn't seal the deal. That would be their only loss. Yeah, it was a heck of a game. And they came close on the road in Baltimore. And it was just a little thing I was looking at at the break when the offense went off the field after a field goal. Ernest Jones, who's become one of the leaders on that defense, he's the first guy off the field, off the sideline to congratulate the offense on the drive that they put together. So little things like that tell you about the chemistry. Yeah third and inches And they get a couple of yards in addition to those inches as Jamal Williams picks up the first down And we will be under the 10 mark in the fourth quarter So the Saints, again, you go to next week. Huge game, I don't have to tell you. Meanwhile, you know, Tampa Bay, they get beat on Sunday or whenever the game is this week. I've lost track with every day of the week. And I'm making things even more interesting. Carr throws, caught, but Kamara cannot even get out of the backfield. Quinn Lake makes that tackle. Quinn Lake is, I think, really finding a home there in that spot, nickel spot. Second-year man out of UCLA. Has some great instincts. I think they thought he'd be more of a safety with what he would do as an NFL player, but really settling in, showing the versatility to play in coverage in space, tackles, blitzes, does it all. Second and 13. Catch me here. 31-yard line. We're talking about Tampa Bay. They are home this week. Jacksonville goes there. You wonder about Trevor Lawrence. Can he play or not? That's a huge game because then Atlanta could sneak back in as well and make it a three-way tie. Absolutely. They're not out of it. third down five car first down and a lot more and to the 13 yard line Jawan Johnson with your tight end out of Oregon first and ten I watched him grow as a young receiver at Penn State and he goes to Oregon as a receiver and eventually becomes a tight end. So he's got those wide receiver skills, and there's the tight end in him. So he can play in space. Then he can run over top of his safety like Jordan Fuller. So he's got a great skill set. From the 13. Eight minutes left. Carr. Starts the run. Keeps it forced out of bounds at the 10. Talk about Atlanta. Atlanta plays Indianapolis this week at home. And Taylor Heineke is going to start for the Falcons. You know, if Atlanta wins, Saints lose, Bucs lose. Right there in three-way time. Yeah. We were talking earlier today about the Colts. What a story they have become. If we would have thought, you know, back at the beginning of this season, that they would be in a position with three games to go to be right in the thick of that wild card race with Minshew in a quarterback. Carr under pressure, gets it away. Kamara makes the catch, and a nice ankle tackle is made there by Christian Roseman, stopping him for a third down, third and two. Ten straight completions now. but Picard and a lot of dink and dunk. And Roseboom is another example of a guy that's been more of a special teams player early in his career. Now he's taken on more of a bigger role, obviously, at linebacker and taken advantage of it next to Jones. To the end zone. Touchdown. Jawan Johnson makes the grab. Threw it over the head of John Johnson. One Johnson beats the other for the score. They go 12 plays, 75 yards, and takes them a little over six minutes to do it. There he is, flexed out again. One-on-one matchup. Alave to his left, who tries to rub the defender, and he does just enough there to help him get the separation. The ball is perfectly thrown up in the air. to the big guy. Let him go up at 6-4 and make the catch. Blake Groupie kicks the extra point. So it's a 30. Timeout. Los Angeles Rams. So week four, you go back to this game with Carr going down and a loss to the Buccaneers 26-9. You go to week 12. Then you got the Atlanta The Falcons knocking them off. The two division rivals, 24-15, the final score in that one. And I think this team has been able to win the last two weeks against inferior opponents. And I think it got a lot of people excited to see them at 7-7. And I think this is a chance tonight to travel out to Los Angeles to take on this Rams team that we keep talking about, how good they look. And what did you say, a litmus test in the open, really? You'll find out how much happily improved, you know, from being 5-7 to now having a shot to control our own destiny. Well, the only team with a winning record they've beaten thus far this season are the Colts. Third down and eight. Safford's now thrown for over 300 yards. Tries to add to that total. and it's Cooper Cupp going to a knee making the grab about three yards short of a first out of score down and this will continue to be an area that you're going to hear after this game Sean McVay talk about they didn't quite get into the red zone here but that continues to I think show up a little bit you know the inability to finish off drives when they move the ball up and down the field and then they get down into this area and they do not want to have to continue for field goals as they get down the stretch, not just the last two games, but if they get a chance into the postseason. Aversick, kicked to the University of Arizona, who's there for five seasons. 32-yard attempt, so he is good on all the shorties tonight. Can I tell you? Pretty good, Dwight. I'll say. For the Saints to get it, down by 23. and once again Evans big leg he's their punter kickoff man booms it through the end zone let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS and it's about the pre-snap movement that we've seen all year from this Rams team tonight 90 percent of different kind of shifts and motions we talked about their personnel groupings and how they create a lot of confusion with their versatility of these receivers. I'd say top three on the season. Creates matchups in the pass game. Gives Matthew Stafford a tip on coverage and also helps in the running game with blocking angles with those receivers that are going in motion. That's those linemen also get up to that second level pretty easy. Carr checks it down. Kamara. Unable to get on track. Alvin's been, you know, he's still there as Sean McVay. Just along the side. You look at Nakua. You look at Cup. There's a shot glanced by Wentz. But, you know, Kamara, maybe not as explosive as he has been in the past, but still a very good back. Yeah, great back. But tonight a non-factor. I mean, if the Saints were going to come in here and win, You figured 41 was going to have to go over 100 yards, yards from the sprinted yards. Tonight he's just not been a factor at all. Yeah, 19 yards on the ground. Here he is again. And the minute, of course, we start talking about him not having a good night, he has a nice play here. Quentin Lake knocks him down. He's now caught three balls, but including that one for nine yards, only for 14 yards total. Yeah, and I think it's pretty obvious Raheem Morris made him a priority. You know, when you have a difference maker like that, they want to take him out of the run game and the pass game. Over the middle, caught 50-yard line. Olavi makes that grab there, ball in midfield, first down. Eight catches for Olavi tonight, 116 receiving yards for him. Three times tonight, they've turned the ball over. On downs. One other time, a pick. To the outside. Three or four yard gain for Shahid. And Quinton Lake is there to make the stop. I know things change. You know, in the NFL, it's a week-to-week business. But this Rams team now has about five or six weeks where they've played the same kind of football. And it just looks like an unselfish group. You know, and a team that plays together. second and six and check it down here close to a first down to the 26 and i and i think everybody's always marveled how young he is and and what an offensive genius he is right and he's had so many assistants go on to do great things i think what he's done since they won the super bowl in 21 right here had a really tough year last year with injuries lost a lot of great players had to rebuild it this year. They start 3-6, have some injuries, and all of a sudden they've won four of their last five, potentially five of their last six, and they've found a new identity. What he's been able to do these last six weeks. Second and 14 is Nakua makes the catch, and that's enough for a first down. I think people are gaining even more appreciation for who he is as a head coach as he continues to grow. and I think he's just showing he's reinvented himself offensively with Matt Stafford and with his new offensive line in Kyron Williams the rookie receiver to go along with Kup Demarcus Robinson comes over from Baltimore I mean, it's a completely new roster from who they were two years ago Young Good, getting better Kind of becoming that team you might not want to see in the playoffs the way things are going right now I wouldn't want to play this team. Well, you know, with McVay, when you're looking at him, I'll tell you what. I know him pretty well. After he won the Super Bowl, that took a lot out of him. A lot. And he was even thinking about, believe it or not, maybe stepping aside, maybe going into broadcasting. Didn't know. This was, you know, a few days afterwards. And part of the problem, too, is he knew he had to have a whole new staff. and he had to go back and he'd reached the mountaintop and now he's going to go, you know, interview like 8, 10 new coaches. Took a lot out of him. Yeah, had to start all over. Yep. Second and 11. Finding his way, looking like Williams is time, it's Rivers. So he does a Kyron imitation and takes it to the 49-yard line and takes us to the fourth quarter. Starting the fourth, we can take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS. So at the moment, in real time here, the Saints would have a 26% chance of getting to the playoffs. The Rams at 65%. That counts where we are in this game tonight, assuming that New Orleans will not be likely to erase a 20-point deficit. So it's third and inches, and they pick up the first down and a lot more, and Nakua down the sideline he goes before he steps out of bounds. Puka Nakua run out by Amadi. And for Puka Nakua, yet another big night for him. Ten targets. He's caught eight for 148 yards. That one good for 29. This is what happens when you have confidence as a play caller in your quarterback. Third and short, you got the nice lead. I know it's easy to do, but Matthew Stafford is going to make that throw. The defense's eyes, they're thinking run on third and short. Instead, you slip the rookie out. Gets easy separation, a nice big game. Rivers. And a one or two. Remaining schedules now. So for the Tampa Bay Bucs, they face the Saints next week. Tampa Bay and Atlanta have both beaten New Orleans this season. Those are the two games remaining for them. Meanwhile, the Rams go to the Meadowlands to meet the Giants next week. Then they go to San Francisco. It's an interesting game. If San Francisco has the number one seed, do they arrest guys? Are they still fighting for the number one seed? You just don't know. But you control it. One thing we know, no matter what happens with the Rams, they're going to be a fun team to watch into January right now. Already are second and eight. And that pass is incomplete. Matthew hitting Cooper Cup along the sideline Brown wants a flag Don't get it, third and eight By rule, there is no foul for pass interference The contact happens This ball has to be a scrimmage More than a yard downfield for that to be a foul That's why you're Matthew kind of smiling It was too close to the line of scrimmage there the Rams are kind of the way the Bills are coming on right now they're kind of that version in the NFC well if they win this game that's 5 out of 6 probably be favored at the Meadowlands next week San Fran as we said we don't know what that's going to mean or not mean to the 49ers at that point third and eight and Sean McFace has to stop the clock. He had a 14 game. Carr on that drive was 10 of 10. Fell over the last four weeks, and he continues to make great decisions, gives his team a chance to make plays. He's 23-33, over 300 yards, and a couple touchdowns. That one to DeMarcus Robinson. And the go-to guy's been the rookie, Nikola, with another big night for this Rams offense. Eight catches, 148 yards. with a quarterback like Stafford if this team does get into the postseason we keep saying it, you're going to want to look out for the Rams as one of those teams that is a threat right now blazing hot don't forget Kyron Williams 16 rushes for 90 yards tonight bouncing ball and picked up at the 14 yard line by Trammell that's where the Rams will take over Six and a half to go, and we're back in 30 ticks. 17-yard line. I didn't lie to you. I told you we'd be back in 30 shakes of a lamb's tail, of course. Yes. Yeah. There you go. Got to be honest. Six and a half to go. Rams trying to make it five of their last six. Get to eight and seven. Pass to the playoffs. They control it. Stafford looking for more. Gets more. Nakula, look at that spin move. Spins back the other way. Got a flag down. From the moment up to the 33-yard line. Flag on the other side of the field. It's right where Demarcus Robinson was. Running his round. Holding defense number 29. That penalty has declined. Result of the play. First down. Pook has been winning these matchups. You know the Saints are going to play in man-to-man. It's a matter of can you win. And he's shown, you know, he's got good quickness to be able to win. But he also has some good size. And I think that's the part of his game that is very underrated. And I think it's the part he probably takes the most pride in. On the ground, you've got Tyron Williams. So when it comes to rookies, and the clue of having a sensational rookie, you're going to etch his name into the record book in a few categories. Most games with 140 or more yards. Bill Groman, back when the American Football League started with the Houston Oilers in 1960, then Beckham as a rookie in 14. Billy Houghton, many, many moons ago with Green Bay and Nakua this season. Think about that. Of all the rookies and all the great receivers, there's your list right there. Second down and nine. To the outside. Over 100 now. Williams taken down at the Saints 40-yard line. Tyron Williams but meanwhile it's going to come back so take away what would have been like a 26 yard gain and instead a penalty on Allen for holding that's one of those it really didn't impact the play at all the center this time gets called for it right over the nose guard there He just grabs onto the jersey, but you can see him. He bounced that ball way to the outside, out to the right. Actually, Davis Allen right there, in fact, did have a big impact on it, locked it up with Cameron Jordan. So Williams, who would have been over 100, is now back to 91. And it's second down to 19. Under five to play. and he'll chug his way for a yard or two here to make it third and long say second time I remember the season started four minutes in 44 second makers was gonna be the Rams number one back they didn't know what they had in Williams yet he lasted a week and then they let Williams go they traded him to Minnesota and that's when this guy came in and started to do his thing. Next week we go to Cleveland. It's our last Thursday night game of the season. The Jets will be taking on the Cleveland Browns who are vying for a playoff spot obviously in the AFC North. Last week they had that lead against Washington 20 to nothing and all of a sudden you know the commanders made it a game at the end, held on, won the game. And kind of like a little bit of that same scenario right now. So 30-22 and they're going to try an onside kick here. And that's Nakua. And Nakua is there to bring the hands team in and the Rams get possession. Of course. Yes. It's either going to be Cooper Cup or Nakua who's going to be there. Saints trying to Kind of play a little game there with which way they might go, but Rams in position to Kua right there. Bobbled it initially, but gets on top of it. So now the Rams have it at the 44. Can play a little bit of clock ball here. With no stoppages for the Saints. Come up in the pistol. Williams the running back Tyron moves that pile keeps those legs turning takes it to the 40 yard line so for him tonight 20 carries in his 98 yards I really like the fact you brought up last week because when you watch the Rams they still look you know you have Stafford and Donald Sean McVay still has a young football team that's learning how to play 60 minutes and learning how to play with the lead and how to put teams away. This is another example tonight, just like last week. Ain't easy. Second and five. Runs the play clock all the way down there. Got Nakua to the outside. Breaks a tackle. Picks up the first down. And that's big. He's going to take a ton of time off the clock and take us down toward the two-minute warning. Broke away from Adebo, had him behind the line of scrimmage, and instead there's Nakua. And Adebo follows him in motion, builds up all that momentum, and then does it wrap up. It's a great hit, but you've got to bring your arms and wrap up a big physical receiver like Nakua. You can't just hit him with force and expect him to go down. Again, Nakua is a powerful wide receiver. 6-2, 2-0-5 Rams only have to run one more play before the two minute stoppage Can Williams get to 100, he's got 99 here he is yes he can he goes to the 28 yard line we will go to the two minute warning and that's 101 make it 102 officially rushing yards for Kyron Williams tonight You know the Rams have only hit four different receivers tonight They've done it on the ground and enough through the air and in the two-minute warning it's 30 to 22 Let the 27 of the Saints Can take it down under a minute and maybe add some yardage to this man's total for the 26-yard line goes Williams on his 22nd carry of the night third down so take it down to about a minute 15 Saints out of timeouts for another run here right run a play and just leave with a few seconds you know it's interesting if they would try to attempt to field goal. Anything but automatic this year. Third down and six. Oh, he looked that clock and may have gotten the... Yes, you got an offside right there. It's Cam Jordan. So Cam in his 13th season Pretty quiet night Obviously draws a lot of attention It's a vet against a vet Stafford with the snap count Neutral zone infraction Defense number 94 Five yard penalty Four third down A guy like Cam Jordan knows That's common with Stafford, that hard count. Well, that's going to make a third and one. Not much laundry tonight, you know. They've only had six accepted penalties in the game. For the record, nine wins, five losses. Jets are the reverse, five and nine. Next Thursday night. The third down and 17 after the Saints are taking the timeout. They're down to the last one. They had to use one earlier. And here's Williams, and he gets stuffed at the line of scrimmage. Tyron Matthews right there. And the Saints will spend their final timeout. So only one more stoppage of the clock for them at the two-minute warning. I see a very animated Sean McVay down there because I think he felt like he had a chance to ice his game with that nice big run that he had from Kyron Williams comes back with a penalty. So the Saints do their job to get off the field and get Derek Carr back out there one more time, see what he can do. The teams keep talking about playing their best in December. Happy winter, by the way. This is our first night of winter. And the Rams are playing their best in December. They sure are. And I just think they found something here. Sometimes it takes a young team time to come together and find their roles. And I think they've done it on both sides of the football. Ethan Evans is the punter. And that one is blocked. And that is JT Gray, who is without question their best special teamer, who comes in and got a piece of it. So, it's a 16-2 possession game. Down by 16, and the Saints are going to get the ball in Rams territory. With 4.33 to play in the fourth. Putting an overload to the left of the Rams. They have five on that side, and it frees up their special teams with JT Gray to be able to make this block off the edge. Just one too many guys to block. Nothing Davis Allen could do. And a good job by Gray going down to the punt to be able to come up with. He almost got the hole. He was in so quickly. It actually bounced, it looks like, off his chest there. Punt actually went eight yards. Officially, it's not ruled a block. But that's not going to do a lot for the punter's average. Eight-yard punt ball to 35. Start here. and Shahid cannot get past the line of scrimmage. Because they used all those timeouts and you're looking at it's still technically a two-possession game and the Saints have been great this year on two-point conversions if they get that chance. They're three for three. But they've got to hustle here. I mean, this is all about scoring and scoring fast if they are serious about trying to get another possession. Yeah, their only stoppage would come at the two-minute warning. under four minutes now as they snap this one Carr going for it all and it's caught A.T. Perry his first catch of the night touchdown over Colby Durant for six so 35 yards just like that they needed to score quickly and that's exactly what they did wow what a play here and I'm surprised the Rams left the receivers one-on-one. Watch what happens here. Takes the safety with him, creates one-on-one to the outside, and that's just a big receiver going up and making a play on the ball, and the rookie A.T. Perry. One-on-one against Kobe Durant, who's in this week for Darion Kendrick, and what a catch. So now the two-point conversion to try to turn it into an eight-point game. Carr. Looks right. Goes left. Two-pointer. Olave. So, 30-22. With a good amount of time, even though they don't have a timeout. 353. Still left. Let's go back and look at this touchdown and how it was designed. I want to show you before we roll it what happens with the inside receiver taking Lake into safety. That creates the one-on-one opportunity there. And I think Derek Carr surprised not to see them in more of a too high look with two safeties back to protect from a one-on-one opportunity like this with a big receiver. He's 6'5". And then they get the two-point conversion. Mentioned they're three for three on the year. Nice little move. gets separation from Witherspoon, who's got his back turned away in man coverage, loses him in coverage, an easy throw there for Card. He got an eight-point game. Well, the Rams had a little problem sealing the defense.
