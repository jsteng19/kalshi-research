 Going for us for Eckler. Tackled by Darius Slay. We go to Kaylee. Guys, Jayden Daniels told us we may see him grimace in pain when he throws the ball tonight. As you guys mentioned, he's continuing to play through that rib injury he suffered three and a half weeks ago against Carolina. He admits it's been a challenge, especially in his upper torso rotation. You see him there just before this drive. That's an additional layer of protection. He's wearing a carbon fiber pad under his rib pads. They adjusted it. But he's adamant in telling us there are no limitations. Second down and 11 now. Robinson in motion. They look that way. Give it to Eckler. And Eckler bouncing his way out to about the 11-yard line. Interesting to continue to go with that pony personnel with the two backs in the backfield. They've done that more than anybody this year in the entire NFL. And already tonight using an 8 of the 9 snap. So, gives him another weapon when you get a healthy Brian Robinson along with Eckler. Third and five. Eckler now alone in the backfield with Daniels. Finish on Blitz, back off. Daniels under pressure. Daniels is going to run. Dan Daniels will be taken down short of the first down of the 11-yard line. and Kobe Dean made sure if he didn't escape his grasp in the final minute of the quarter. It'll be fourth down. He's almost just sitting here playing a spy, but he also is aware of the underneath routes on his third down. He turns his body. He's looking for that crosser, but while he's here, he played against this quarterback in the SEC. He was at Georgia. Daniel was at LSU and knows what he's capable of doing. He's right where he needs to be on third down. Tress Way with his second punt. left footed kicker his first one 51 yards coming up making the grab and on the run at the 45 yard line Cooper DeGene so again we've been talking a lot 20 seconds of the quarter Washington not only have they made all these moves new head coach get Daniels a lot of other moves but almost every move they've made has paid off a lot of Spread it to Adam Peters, the new GM. You know, they knew with what they inherited, things had to change. And they went through that year last year, made the changes, hired a great coach, changed the culture. And I think being able to pick Jaden Daniels up, you know what that does, Al. You get a quarterback that your entire franchise believes in, and they say behind closed doors, how he treats everybody has been also a game changer. So it's not just what he's doing on the field. Well, three years at Arizona State, then two years at LSU. He played, what, 55 games in common? Yeah, 55 starts. A little bit of experience. So out of the pistol now, Barkley behind. Hurts. Saquon will take it. And in the first quarter with this run from the 41-yard line. So it's the end of one in Philadelphia on this Thursday night. 7-0. Very tight race in the AFC North. Mike Tomlin and his team trying to stay on top. Pittsburgh-Cleveland, always a great rivalry next Thursday night. Second down and three now as we start the second quarter. From the 41-yard line. Barkley turns it back a little bit short here. the first. Barkley's now carried eight times for 29. Frankie Loubu makes the stop, third and one. You know, Bobby Wagner gets a lot of attention coming over from Seattle, but I'll tell you, Frankie Loubu coming over from Carolina, he does so much in this Dan Quinn defense where he makes plays like that against the run. They blitz him off the edge. A lot of times line him up on third down. He does just a bunch. Keep an eye on four tonight. Well, if they lined up as if they're going to have the tush push instead, it's Barkley so he picks up a first down here it's a good change up I mean anytime they get into that formation Kellen Moore says hey the tendency is we're going to obviously do it it's going to work so instead just a quick flip to the outside you know if that defense over commits and pinches into the inside to stop Jalen Hurts you get one kick out block Barkley can be off to the races so still they pick up the first down but a nice change from the traditional Easy route that they go for those first downs Got that block from Goddard the tight end Sniff in the slot brown wide right and a little trickery here, but nothing doing boy Was that smelled out perfectly that time you try Frankie you'll do the day after Thanksgiving on prime What kind of intensity is Dan Quinn bring to this franchise franchise with the positive energy. Every single person you talk with, and you and I had the commanders a year ago, it's a complete about-face as far as the direction this franchise is heading. New ownership, new GM, new quarterback, new head coach, new system. There's a lot to like about what these guys are doing. Adam Peters came over as the GM from San Francisco. Here's Shipley on the run back, and Shipley with a good run back before he's taken out of bounds and we go to Kaylee. Well guys, we hear it every week, right? Playing on a quick turnaround is never easy. So Dan Quinn told the commanders, it's shark week. It doesn't matter how tired they are, how sore they are, you gotta come in and keep attacking like sharks do. Safety Jeremy Chin told me it really turned him up when Quinn started preaching that mantra on Monday. Yesterday he was showing the team clips from the movie Jaws and Al, I think you're gonna need a bigger boat. Well, He'd be a candidate for Shark Tank as well, I guess. He keeps winning, he will be. So Jalen Hurts going to work with 320 to go in the opening quarter. Washington up 7-0. He's keep rolling, throwing down the sideline, and that is incomplete to Bonte Smith. Another guy in this game who won the Heisman Trophy. Yeah. Second and ten. Usually very, very, very sure-handed. And I think that time maybe more concerned about his feet than catching the football. But one thing about Dan Quinn, he's one of those guys. You ever meet these guys? You're like this. I mean, he's got a short week this week. Great. Looking forward. I want a short week. Like anything you bring up to him, he turns it into a positive. Like he's always going to find a way to deflect and find a way to be positive about something. He's got to love that. Yeah, he's intense. But he's a lot of fun to be around. Great sense of humor. known him a long time, good man, head coach in Atlanta, of course, for a number of years. Little toss here, and out to the 43-yard line goes Saquon Barkley. These tight ends do a really good job out on the perimeter in this run game. Remember, this Philly offense, it is built on their ability to run the football. I mean, we can talk all we want about the big playability of A.J. Brown, Devontae Smith, what they can do downfield, and that's part of it. But it starts with what they do with the line of scrimmage these last five weeks. Run the football with Saquon Barkley, occasionally with Jalen Hurts. Get that defense's eyes, worried about the run game, and then you play action. And then you take the shots downfield. Two and a half left in the quarter. On the third down and four. Pressure, throws, drops. Up at the 48-yard line. That's Dotson. Again, Dotson came over from Washington a couple years ago. drafted in the first round, number three receiver here, fourth down. Of course, Jalen Hurst can go right or go left. He saw that soft coverage, thought that he had to throw. Sanistro is a very good player, comes in there as a rookie. A.J. Brown with movement, just a little stick route, sits there in the open spot. He's all alone. If he happened to look left, that's a first down. He opts to go to the soft coverage against the rookie corner, and it doesn't work out. Braden Mann, his second punt. first was 38 yards Zaccheaus is back there, drifting falls in at the 8 yard line and we'll be taking that out of bounds at about the 18 with a flag down so Adrian Hill will check with his cohorts. There's Cliff Ingsbury. We'll talk about him as we move along. The offensive coordinator. Calls going to be on Noah Ibn Aghani. How's that, man? I was giving you a little bit of a head start. A little more than that during the return. Number one. That penalty Teamwork. First time in Washington. Yeah, you didn't want me to be an ignorantist. We're back in 30. And in a row, points in the first quarter. Going to go back to 1983. Last time they got into double figures. Robinson and Eckler both in that backfield now. From the end zone, looking, throwing, and nowhere. Pointing against Washington. Anytime you run outside, it's usually a hold out on the edge. Holding offense, number two, senior penalty. That's Brown on the outside. A lot of these quarterbacks have different ways of getting themselves ready. Jaden Daniels, who is telling us he's the best basketball player on the team. He does this since he's been in high school. I'm sure one of his quarterback coaches over the years told him about this, and he said he does a bunch of different movements, a bunch of different things, and by the time he's done with maybe a 10- or 15-minute workout with a basketball, he said the football feels like it's a peewee ball in his hands. Isn't it strange if sweet Georgia Brown? Maybe he should go across the parking lot. The Sixers are 2-9. They might be able to use him. I told him. Second and ten from the 38-yard line. In the pocket. Throws to the outside. Shifty Eckler. Inside and out. He goes third down and five. You know, big question this year was how good would this secondary be for Philadelphia with Vic Fangino. So they went out and got the two rookies, Quinion Mitchell from Toledo, who's holding up at right corner, 27, and Cooper DeGene, who's playing that nickel spot, who was in on that last tackle. It went from being a question mark to really solidifying them on the back end. Third and four. Daniel Stroz and the old eagle himself, Zach Ertz. Eight years here, went to Arizona for a couple of seasons. Zach now in his 12th year. Big hero in this town. First down. No doubt about it. I know he's fired up to be back. Look at the soft coverage. That's a big tight end against the rookie we just talked about. Mitchell on third and short, giving him a lot of room off the line of scrimmage. And good recognition there by Daniels with a pre-snap feel to be able to see the big tight end. Who's one of his favorite targets on third down. He's able to get it out to him on the perimeter. Five minutes left in the half. Rolling left. Daniels, he's going to keep it. He's going right there to make sure he doesn't go any farther. That'll be a gain of one, if anything. Second down. Cliff Kingsbury telling us this week after the loss to Pittsburgh, he texted Jaden Daniels about, hey, it's all right, we're going to get this thing going. They've been protecting him from running the football, and he hit him back, Coach, you need to let me go. It's been four weeks. Let me start running the ball. Cliff really liked that response. Off play action. Pass is not caught. It's Noah Brown. Pass a little bit low. Couldn't hold on. Of course, Noah Brown will be forever remembered by all Commanders fans for making the catch on that miracle play against Chicago a couple of weeks back. Yeah, of course. He has it. Great job at the top of the route. The stem to the outside. works across the field there gets great separation over the top there and put it in front of him big game there yeah through a bounce pass third and nine haven't seen McLaurin yet their leading receiver oh and it's dropped by Eckler hmm she got a pass that's shorter than Eckler normally sure-handed, drops that one fourth and nine. Yeah, it's a little mesh route, and Zach Ertz does a good job of getting in way of the defender, and that's just Eckler, as good as he is out of the backfield, starting to look to where he wanted to run with that football, and with that little rub there by Ertz, there was enough there for him, I think, to be able to catch that football and run to the corner to pick up a first down. So Tresway, his fourth punt. This didn't figure to be a punt-a-thon, but this is the seventh punt of the half. Ball four made a fair catch at the 10-yard line with 4-11. It's a halftime. Blind hurdle. Yeah. He said his body just took over, right? The NFL. I mean, what in the world's happening? Yeah. From the 10-yard line, the Eagles trying to get something going and start with a pass to the outside and trying to pick up the first down is Barkley. Down we go to Kaylee again. And, guys, I think we all got a good laugh out of it when Nick Sirianni told us his 8-year-old son was one of those kids watching that game with his friends who all immediately said, we're going to do that. But Sirianni's brother, a football coach himself, had to be the one to tell those kids, you don't have the ability to do what Saquon did. Don't try that. Ten, by far their best drive of the night. 72 yards, nine plays. Elliott hoping that he comes in for an extra point and not a field goal attempt. And remember with Jalen Hurts, we saw it last week against Dallas. Three red zone interceptions this season. That's tied for the most with Daniel Jones and Sam Darnold. So don't want to feel that he has to make a play and force a throw down in this area. Brown to the outside. Brown comes in motion to the inside. Hurts to go to the end zone. And it's broken up in the end zone. And again, that's Seamus still who just was called for the penalty on the last play. Busting it up third down at eight. Yeah, he played some receiver when he was at Michigan. I think he has some really good instincts. Known as a slot corner. Here he is with Devontae Smith, a little stutter and go. Doesn't really fall for it at all. He's in position there. And what I love about him as a young corner is he's able to locate the football and play on the ball and knock it away. That rookie picked in the second round. Third down and eight. Four-man rush. Ertz signaling. Same block for me. They do. He gets the first down. Gainwell led the way. This is the danger by Armstrong. When you get upfield, a little spin move takes him out. and now look at all that space. And that's what you do not want to do and can't afford to do because the acceleration and the power that he runs with, when he gets going, he covers a lot of ground and he's able to know exactly where he needs to go to pick up that first down. That's a critical scramble for the first down there by Jalen Hurts. Well, the third down and eight. First and goal now from the nine. Barkley comes in motion. Jalen's going to keep it himself. breaking tackles to the four he goes and they take a timeout so from the four to be a second and goal as they have now marched 86 yards in 12 plays 42 rushing first downs and if the defensive coordinator you know his legs give you that extra thought to be able to prevent you playing certain coverages because you have to respect that, that extra gap, especially down in this area. So it opens up opportunities for him in his passing game. We'll see what they end up doing here to try to punch it in. I think it would be a shootout. But, you know, so many games. Remember, even the Baltimore-Cincinnati game last week, first half started slow and then caught fire. And then the second half was crazy. Yeah, yeah. One of the best games of the season. Anyway, as play resumes here after the timeout, second down and goal, 33 seconds. Philly still has a couple of timeouts if necessary. Barkley stood up at the three-yard line, pushed back, third down and goal. Timeout. Defensive line doing their job there, eating up all those blocks and freed up the backers and the safeties, able to clean that up, prevent him from getting into the end zone. They slanted. They just kind of trying to occupy space, eat those linemen up, try to keep Martin free. I think Benogany is able to get involved. The nickel actually made contact first there. So now you've got more than likely a pass, and you've got the threat, as we've seen here in the red zone. Jalen Hurts taking it, pulling it down, and trying to get into the end zone himself. Goddard always a great target down here with his size at tight end at 6'5". Think he rolls out here? I wouldn't keep him in the middle of the field where you can allow him to step up instead of taking away the field and just giving him half field to work with. Johnny Wilson in motion. He's a 6'6 receiver for the touchdown pass last week. Surveying, looking. He just flips it away. I'm going to call it an incomplete pass. It's fourth and goal. Quan Martin put the pressure on. So you've got fourth down and goal now. And the crowd sensing the field goal attempt and not very happy about anything right now. You've got a couple receivers that end up just coming free, most notably Devontae Smith. Look at the back of it. Here's Tressley. his third kick of the night the gene is back there he's going to let it go but he squibs its way out of bounds at the 26 yard line 9.51 to the half and we're back in half a minute with that sack of Tom Brady in the Super Bowl the Eagles missed field goal, couple of punts and another missed three point attempt so they start here now from their own 26-yard line. They've run 25 plays for only 86 yards. Hurts keeps it himself. Takes up about six, second and four. I'm sure the thing Kellen Moore is talking to Jalen Hurts about when they get over to the sideline is, you know, obviously be patient, keep your poise. Really, the Eagles have hurt themselves. A couple drops. Mentioned the two missed field goals. The holding call by Becton, the right guard. Bond losing Eckler in man coverage. They started in plus territory, had that trick play kind of backfired. So a lot's gone against them in some of their own doing. Only one big play, the 25-yard reception by Brown. Barkley through the middle and nothing happening there for Saquon. Lueville in on the tackle. Well, of course, the Giant fans are out of their minds. The fact that Barkley was let go, so much of it was played out, you know, in the HBO show, the hard knock show, behind the scenes, everybody's going, what the hell? And just watching that, and I think if you know Saquon Barkley, he just seemed to have it started right there, a chip on his shoulder. And I think he came to Philadelphia, felt loved, felt that they believed in him. And I think it has a lot to do with this newfound confidence that's been maybe missing the last couple years. Third and four. Flush him out. Throwing. Incomplete. Pressure put on. A.J. Brown, the intended receiver. Crowd, of course, is unhappy, which they are prone to do once in a while in Philadelphia. Fourth down. This is one, again, if you're a Philly fan, you're thinking this is going to be a completion. Not only is A.J. Brown your guy, but the defender falls, and that's a safety. That's Jeremy Chen. I mean, Jeremy Chen, if he doesn't fall down, he's not going to be able to stay with A.J. Brown. Right now, this rhythm to this offense, and Jalen Hurts is a streaky quarterback. He can go a few series like this and catch fire, but so far they're still searching for that rhythm. Here's Mann's putt. It's not fair put. Zaccheaus with a two-yard run. But, yeah, that's what happened last week with Hurts. Bad first there. Lighted it up in the second. It's down. Yep. 7-0. If he shows up caroling in your front yard, are you thinking about calling the gendarmes? On first down here, De'Anne Brown. And he scores his way out to the 31-yard line. And speaking of Mr. Kelsey, taking his presence felt. ESPN and beyond. It's coming, I promise you. He may be in the back of some suite right now. Yeah, this tempo offense, you just never know, right? You've got to be ready. Exactly. Second down is six. Robinson is the back. and working his way through tackles, breaking them, picking up a first down onto the 38-yard line. Cliff Kingsbury has put in an offense this year in Washington where there's a lot of pre-snap, a lot of that fly motion that affects the eyes of the linebackers and creates just a little bit of hesitation. And when you mix in that power inside run with Robinson back healthy, it's a lot for these backers to deal with. rolling, throwing, caught open, Robinson fights his way close to a first down tackled inbounds there by Cooper to Gene second and one Philadelphia's done a good job of taking receivers away so far in his first half most of these passes have been against the linebackers in coverage that time we've seen Eckler slip out of the backfield this time Robinson after the good run there's Kelsey right there trying out with Stevie Nicks for Fleetwood Mac I guess. There he is. What can't he do? He does everything. Is it all? I'm trying to think. Second and one. Eckler to the outside. Turns it back. Takes it to the 50-yard line. First down. Fleck. There it is. They go to the very back of the playbook. Not even close. and that's a loss of 14. It just feels like the timing on this, it happened too fast. The defense didn't have a chance to really follow Saquon Barkley. Lube, you'll see, but you'd love to see Barkley take a few more steps to draw the defense to him, but instead that happened so quickly that the defense, they didn't have a chance to react to Barkley running to their left. And Lube, that instinct, there he is again making a play. This will be a loss of 13, second and 23. Slinging off here to Gainwell. And he'll take it to about the 42-yard line, setting up a third and long. Right now, Joe Witt, the defensive coordinator, a lot of times they're getting this Philly offense behind the sticks, whether it's miscues, penalties. You saw that tackle there on that trick play. It's allowed them to sit back and play a lot more coverage, Not having to blitz, not having to load up, leave their corners on islands. The goal tonight for the commanders is to try to protect their corners as much as they can, and they've been able to do that so far tonight. Emptying the backfield. Philly averaging only three yards per play. That is caught, but taken down after he makes the catch is Dallas Goddard. So he gets the ball into field goal range. line of scrimmage is going to be the 33. So now you've got an attempt here by Elliott who has not made a 50 yard field goal this season. And this one from 51. Missed earlier from 44. He's missed three from 50 plus this season. So can he make it from 51? Kick on the way. Nope. Again. 0 for 2. Dan Quinn, much in appreciation, remains 7-0. We talked about Zach Vaughn moving, coming in from New Orleans and moving to that inside linebacker spot. Such great feel and instants for a guy. He hasn't played a lot at this position. So he's been a major addition. The Kobe Dean coming off the loose strength surgery from last year where he only played five games. I'm telling you, this guy from watching him at Georgia, one of the best leaders I've ever seen or covered. And those two together have sure made a big difference this year for Vic Fangio in this Eagles defense. The two top tacklers on the team. Off the play fake. Dancing. Look out. Daniel spins. taken down to the 37-yard line by Brandon Graham. How long have we been talking about him? 15 years in the league, played at Michigan. Number one draft choice back in 2010. Great career. It's a play where you'd love to see the young quarterback make a decision and either get the ball and check it down or get out. You know, get out of there with his athletic ability and try to get something out of it instead of taking a loss. But let's give Philadelphia's coverage downfield a lot of credit. Everybody taken away, which allowed Graham and company to eventually get home. Go empty here on a second and 14. Daniels under pressure again. Swung down to the 29-yard line. Josh Sweat. Wiping off some sweat. Third and long. This is a heck of a battle. Not just when the commanders are running, but of course when they have to protect their quarterback. Last one was a coverage sack. This time Jalen Carter forces it. Sweat cleans it up. Watch this move right here, that club. And then he's got the quickness to be able to affect that quarterback. Makes him step away. And then the tandem there was Sweat to be able to get the sack. Brings the crowd very much to life on the third and 22. Keep it on the ground. Robinson. Stubbed him at the 35 with the flag down. In fact, two flags are down both on the offensive backfield. That's their plan tonight. Get Jaden Daniels behind the sticks. Don't let his creativity have an impact on the game. Keep him in the pocket. saw a coverage sack when Brandon Grant got home and you see Sweat playing off of Jalen Carter to be able to get a sack out of way behind the sticks. Pittsburgh did that last week. They did a great job. Ingles stays in there. Brown and Smith both to the left. Hurts chased. Going to run it. forced out of bounds. He's going to set up a third down with 6.16 to go third and sixth, third quarter. Yeah, just the way this game is going. In fact, you heard Nick Sirianni mention this when he talked to Kaylee about, we've got to take advantage of these opportunities. Well, here we are. Down seven, third and six. Again you don want to roll him out necessarily You keep him in that pocket where he has a threat of always being able to step up buying time to find targets A.J. Brown, Dallas Goddard, both those guys, great threats in this area. Daniel Wells still in there. Flare him out. He won a pass. It's incomplete. Brown, the intended receiver. You've got Saner still the rookie covering him. and with five and a half to go in the third, it's a fourth down and a field goal unit coming in again. I think it shows you what Dan Quinn and Joe Witt think about this rookie out of Michigan, San Francisco. He's out there on an island against A.J. Brown. We saw Devontae Smith give him that same double move, a little stutter and go. He was in great position earlier against Devontae Smith and in great position here against A.J. Brown. 31-yard attempt for Elliott. One for three tonight. Two for four tonight now. Sacks on three. Five and a half left in the third. Washington 10. Philadelphia 6. General manager of the Golden State Warriors for a number of years. During their glory years. Apparently have come back as well. Touchback. Meanwhile, Josh owns three different teams. He's got the 76ers, so they're not too happy with him here right now. But the New Jersey Devils are in first place in their division. They're happy up there. And, of course, they're happy in Washington that he's taken over. Second time last year and this year he stopped by to just say hello on his way to get ready for the game. And one of the things that always stands out to me when we talk to him is, here's an owner that grew up the fan of the team that he now owns. And he is determined and passionate about getting this franchise heading in the right direction. Kaylee just talked about the moves he made from last year to this year. You can only imagine where this will continue to go and build. Of course, you saw the arena across the parking lot where the 76ers and the Philadelphia Flyers play. As Robinson picks up a couple here. Make it three, second and seven. Make no mistake. I mean, it's a 10-6 game. Five minutes to go into third quarter. Hadn't been a pretty game. This is a division rival. First place on the line. This is a massive game for the Commanders. I can't remember the last time they had a game this big at this stage of the season. I mean, this is a big opportunity on the road in Philly. Yeah, it's been a while, a long time since he even finished the World Five. But meanwhile, Daniels, nice move. He takes it to the 40-yard line, and that'll be a first down. This is a team. The last time they won a playoff game was in 05, talking 19 years ago. No postseason wins since then. So not only did they bring in Quinn, they have 13 former NFL players on the coaching staff right now. Yep. very intentional about the energy and the people that they put on their staff. Gained a four here for Robinson. Cliff Kingsbury is a guy that, of course, is helping Jay Daniels. Even the backup quarterback, Marcus Mariota, that was intentional to be able to help a young quarterback and Jay Daniels' wisdom and things that he has to offer. You look at the rest of that coaching staff. They bring over Brian Johnson, who was here in Philadelphia. Tavita Pritchard, another guy that knows how to kind of work the mindset. So I really like what they're doing here. I think everybody likes what they're doing here and how they're building around Jaden Dannings. So far, so good. Second and six. Robinson again. Nowhere to go. Back to the line of scrimmage. Jordan Davison in the tackle. 345 to go in the third. Jalen Carter has just taken his game to another level. Anybody who followed him in college when he was at Georgia really knew it was a matter of time until he would become an enforcer in the interior. Jordan Davis is in there, a big body, but Carter just violent in how he plays against the run and using that club and quick get-off against the pass. third and five look out, down he goes 34 yard line, Nolan Smith another one of those Georgia Bulldogs gets the sack he's going up to hear Terry what he has to say, but this is when he works out, I thought he grabbed onto the jersey, not there but there and he didn't slow him down at all I mean, I guess for the view of the official, you see that he's grabbing but he's got a significantly hindering perk, and I just don't see it there. Meanwhile, here's Eckler taking it inside the 30-yard line to the 28. So Eckler now has, he's been their primary receiver, gained a 20, targeted seven times, caught six. Six of the nine completions have been to Austin Eckler. And I felt like that play filled out here for the first time all night against his tempo look that they'll throw at you, just out, not quite lined up coming off of that penalty, not really in position, and Washington able to take advantage of that. Robinson, room to roam. Two to 20 he goes. I tell you what, you've got these two guys, you know, Yin and Yang, Thunder and Lightning, Robinson and Eckler, good combo platter in the backfield. It sure is, and that pony look that they're going with the two backs, I think causing some confusion and hesitation, which is giving these offensive linemen that are pulling around in a counter play, giving them a lot of room to be able to pick up some momentum and get downhill into those linebackers. On second and two. Eckler in motion. Daniels will keep it. And stuffed. Brandon Graham right there. lead number 55 stopping him wants to recover a couple third and four well you motion Eckler out and you take the Kobe D with you with that motion so you think the numbers to your advantage you run the quarterback counter they've been running the counter with Robinson numbers are favorable but a good job of squeezing from the outside by that defense led by 55 Graham third and four Daniels backpedal fires nothing incomplete first time they even looked McLaurin's way so their leading receiver had not been targeted until now fourth down yeah but it just the route near the end of it Terry McLaurin just kind of do I need to settle here do you want me to continue I think Jay Daniels thought he would continue across the field expecting man coverage, but he stopped for whatever reason. And they're just, once again, not quite in sync. So a 40-yard attempt for Zane Gonzalez. Like a lot of kickers, journeymen, been around, playing with several different teams. Cleveland, Arizona, Carolina, perfect last week. And you got a whistle, I think, before the snap, and you do. so no kick, no play. You have to lay a game. Yeah, the operation of it. Like you said, you have a new kicker who's capable of making the kick, but the holder, the snap, everybody's just making sure the new kicker is ready to go. There's the play clock. The holder not even aware of that play clock. Down at 5, 4, 3, and 2, so push him back 5 yards. So now you've got a 45-yard attempt. Last week from 41 and 48. Zane Gonzalez to try to tack on three. And he does. So four minutes into the second hand. Washington on top now 10-3. River leading into New Jersey as we come back to the link. Salem open in 2003. Meanwhile, that's Jayden Daniels and some repair work on the sideline. This seems off a little bit tonight. So you've got a cut there on that right pinky, maybe that right hand. This kick is returnable from the five-yard line. Kenneth Gainwell trying to find some room. And a nice run back with a flag that's down on the other side of the field. A little away from the run back. And per usual, it's normally against the receiving team. Adrian O will confirm that. During the return, holding against the return team, number 21. That penalty is enforced 10 yards. First down, Philadelphia. Now let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Focusing on Saquon Barkley. Outside the tackle. Seven carries, 37 yards. Doing a result for the top clock. Washington has one timeout remaining. Okay. And four seconds on the clock. Please reset the gate clock to five seconds. Kaylee, rapidly, what do you have? Guys, Jalen Hurts is in the medical tent right now with the independent Neurotrauma Special. Whoa. All right, obviously keeping an eye on that. Meanwhile, Eagles sent three guys back inside the 10-yard line. Nobody's waving to the crowd. Not yet. And this is going to run the ball here and end the half in a Robinson four-yard pickup. So that is the end of the first half in Philadelphia, and the battle for first place in the NFC East, with the Commanders leading the Eagles 7-3. And we're waiting for Kaylee. And here she is. Well, Dan, it's been a quiet night for Terry McLaurin and your receivers. What do you need to do to get them involved? Yeah, we get the ball starting the second half. That's going to be a big deal for us, just getting all of our playmakers involved. So just a NFC East tough division matchup like you think, but that's certainly a factor for us heading into the second half, no doubt. Well, in the meantime, you have been able to keep the Eagles out of the end zone. How have you been able to do that? Yeah, I think just getting some stops, forcing a couple kicks at the end, that's a big deal. So the ball is going to be at live at the second half. That's the big deal. Thanks, Coach. Thank you. All right, Kaylee. Meanwhile, there's good success with quick throws. Short, underneath throws, anything beyond 10 yards, neither guy having much success at all in that first half. Man's kick taken at the one-yard line. And Eckler loses the ball. So, Austin Eckler loses it. Big scramble for it. Down judge comes in. Adrian Hill is there. And they retain possession. So, again, it was Eckler who dropped the pass right in the numbers. And then Walker comes away with the ball to save the day. 32 is able to pick this up. And Washington, that's been a real area of strength of theirs. seventh in the entire NFL with turnover margin at plus six. Last year, they were dead last in turnover margin. So a big part of the success they've enjoyed this year is not turning that football over. No turnovers for either team tonight. First scrimmage play now of the second half will be a run. And a nice one for Robinson. First floor, gain of eight. Stopped by Blankenship. Kaylee with Seriani moments ago. Well, Nick, I was just told that Jalen Hurts was evaluated for a concussion but cleared to return. What needs to change, though, for your offense to get into the end zone? Yeah, you know, we've been driving, and we missed a couple field goals. So we just got to finish off drives. We shot ourselves in the foot a couple times. We'll get it going. You've been able to take the commander's receivers out of the game. How do you continue to do that? Yeah, it starts up front. We've got to continue to create pressure with the guys that are up front. And then I think they're doing a good job in the secondary getting after them. Thank you. They sure are. Meanwhile, that line does a great job here. Kaelin Carter stopping Robinson in his tracks and turning a second and two into a third and five. That is a tough thing to do. When you pull the guard, Wiley's got to kick down and make this block. Gets off the line of scrimmage a little bit slow, and the get-off by Carter along with the power is what separates him. That is a tough ask of that right tackle, and not up to the task there on that second down play. Yeah, he missed last week's game with a shoulder injury. Third down and five. Vaughn blitzing. Pass is broken up at the 50-yard line, but a flag is thrown. Brown the intended receiver and Cooper the gene, the rookie. I think to get him for a pull on the jersey as he's cutting out on his route. Defense, number 33. The only thing I could see is that he pulled. Watch as Noah Brown sets him up on the route. And near the top of the route, he pulls away. And then that right hand just grabs on. Tough to see there. Didn't really slow him down at all. Oh, boy. We've seen who are seven. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And even Terry McCauley from his vantage point goal. So first down, relatively penalty-free game. Ball at the 50-yard line. Robinson and Eckler both in the backfield. And Robinson will go for a gain of key. Here on Eagle territory. I think this is, and again, a better job outside than he has in the inside. You know, inside the tackle is an area that Philadelphia really prides itself on being able to establish that inside run game to set up other aspects. You can see he has not had a great start. He and that offensive line, not off to a great start. Deron Payne and company from the commanders holding their own against that interior run game. And that defense gave up 31 points per game last year. 22 this season. And three against Philadelphia in the first half. So Hurts, who passed concussion protocol, starts with a run here. And gets tackled up at the 21-yard line gain of eight. To Kaylee we go. So guys, you've got a quick look at Jaden Daniels' hand. It appears that he's got a cut at the base between his pinky and ring finger on that right throwing hand. They were applying a sterile super glue that could quickly close that wound, and now he's all bundled up. All right. Ken, he is, right now, you've got to give Philadelphia a lot of credit for confusing him and the entire commander's offense. He's not able to get anything going in their pass game. Second and three, and it's going to be third and a yard and a half here. as Brockley, they've done a nice job on him tonight. 16 carries 57 yards. It's incredible the numbers you brought up last year, this defense, to what they're doing this year. It's got to be one of the great turnarounds in the entire NFL, what Dan Quinn and Joe Witt have been able to do with his defense. I mean, it's every single stat you look at has changed. And you look at the defenders, these guys that are playing. Deron Payne with the injury to Jonathan Allen, really the only guy that's playing a significant amount of football last year and this year. Everybody's new. Yeah, a lot of new pieces put in there. Meanwhile, they convert on third down up to the 38-yard line. Dallas Goddard, the tight end, makes the grab. Jeremy Chim tracks him down, but that gives the crowd something to yell about 15-yard game. Yeah, you love to see him get his hands on the football. Came back last week after being out a few weeks, and a big part of this offense, And it's just kind of a little bit of a delay there. Gets lost. Chen, I think, with his eyes in the backfield, loses in space there in that zone. Loses the threat of Goddard. And a good job of Jalen Hurts looking him off until that last second when he threw the ball. I checked it down. From the 36, nothing happening here. They stop Barkley in his tracks. Bobby Wagner is right there. You know, what a pickup he is. And, of course, Wagner goes back with Dan Quinn. So we're talking about a guy who knows exactly what his coach wants. There he is. Yeah, he has done a great job being all over the field. And like I said, the communication part of it. And he's raised the bar on Tuesdays in practice and Wednesdays. Just the way he makes guys come in, study film, kind of pulls them along with him. Shows everybody really what it takes to be a professional. So that's a great example. Second and ten. Hey, Mama, Tiger live, Tiger live, Tiger live. Hurry up! Barkley takes it up to about the did he say Tiger Woods on that? All I know is he was getting frustrated he wanted that snap to come up before the threat of a delay a game listen in here Tiger Whip, Tiger Whip Tiger Whip, hurry up! Tiger whip, tiger whip. One of the two. Third and six. Extra pressure. A little dump off is caught. Big game here. Into the secondary goes Shaquan. Barking all the way down the 21-yard line. Just a little lollipop pass. Got away from Percy Butler. The tournament would have been a short game into a very long one. 43 yards. Well, you blitzed a linebacker here. Watch Saquon Barkley able to leak out. Nice job. Just a soft little touch. He's able to avoid the safety. And because everybody else is man coverage, nobody there to pick up Saquon Barkley after he avoids the safety, Kwon Martin. Barkley out for the moment. Gainwell is in there. The pass goes to the right side. Goddard stripped up after a minimal game there by Samar. Still second down and eighth. and he's looking downfield trying to sell that and just a simple check down right there that missed tackle he's got to be able to make that play because everybody else is locked up in man coverage they have no idea that Barkley who's more dangerous than anybody in the open field has the football so Saquon now 61 rushing yards 52 receiving yards in his 50 year in the league Came over from Carolina. What a pickup. Yeah, Chin has been great. You team him up with Quan Martin back there as the two safeties. Both physical, intelligent, really understand this scheme that Dan Quinn likes to run. And they ask a lot of their safeties. Second and eight. To the outside he goes. And that's incomplete. Brown the intended receiver that time. Covered on the play by St. Joost. Third down and eight for the Eagles. this secondary of course the pickup of Marshawn Lattimore the Commanders fans anxious to be able to get him healthy out again with a hamstring maybe be back in a week but in the meantime they're holding up the best they can with St. Juice who does a nice job there's a look right there at Lattimore who's come over well the next game is in 10 days he has 3 extra days to get ready for it 3rd down and 8 and make his Commanders debut Jalen tries to run, but nothing doing there. Frankie Louvoo, another one of their pickups. I mean, they revamped that defense, and what a job they have done. And Daniels will go back to work. It's worth an 11. They rush five. They create a one-on-one opportunity. And Lane Johnson, as good as there is, he's had a Pro Bowl year right tackle right here. But when you go up against Jalen Hurst, you've got to be respectful of him stepping up. Louvoo's awareness there. He didn't get upfield. Watch how he has a feel and understands that Hurts may get underneath him. His vision is on the quarterback and immediately uses the athletic ability to take away any threat but scramble it all on third down. So Zaccheaus is back there, muffed the punt last week and fumbled another one. And the kick by Brayton Mann is a short one that takes a sideways bounce and comes back the other way and is down to the 42-yard line. Five and a half to go in the opening quarter. Fourth quarter, interception, fumble, and of course the Giant fans went crazy. The rest of the league did two, and Jeff had to cut ties with Peterson and bring in Nick Ceriani. That was kind of an ugly night. A lot happened. Oh, yeah. Exactly. To the left side, and with a lot of room to roam, went down the sideline and still going. Still going. As Eckler finally Bond catches up with him. So Austin Eckler, and now you've got a little skirmish going on. A little pushy-shovey. We know Eckler is so dangerous out of the backfield, but I think the motion affected Zach Vaughn and his communication. Watching Eckler move, and you have man coverage. Nobody goes with Eckler. Vaughn initially did, but then he leaves him out there on his own, and he is so dangerous after the catch, one of the better backs in the NFL over the years. But that's just a defense that's not quite on the same page. And to me, it looked like Bond playing man just didn't take him off that motion. Yeah, Robinson and Eckler both in the backfield. Here goes Daniels. He's going to run, and he can run, taking it to the 18-yard line. But that's a Eckler. What a pick. Another, he talked about all the pickups on defense and offensively. Eckler, no stranger to the end zone for sure. Yeah. And how great a sign is that for Commanders fans to be able to see Jaden Daniels run the football. You know, the last four weeks they've been protecting him because of the ribs in the Carolina game. Last week didn't run much at all. Three carries, five yards, and here he's able to show that he's out to run the football. Now both guys again in the backfield. This time they went to Robinson, and Robinson will take the ball to the one-yard line. So Brian Robinson has missed the last two games with a hamstring. The three extra days gave him the opportunity to heal enough to get in tonight, and now at the one-yard line, they will go no huddle. And now you mentioned the two backs. I really think one back going one way, the other coming back the other way on the counter slowed those linebackers down. They were hesitant. Eckler lives in the end zone, but this time they give it to Robinson, and he pushes his way in, and will they give it to him? They do. No forward progress whistle. Touchdown, Washington. And that's what this offense has missed over the last couple games. Not having the back that can pound and get you those tough yards. I mean, he's stopped at about the two or three-yard line right there. Plank and ship is there, but he would not be denied. Gets a little bit of help. And Brian Robinson is great. Dan Quinn has got to be fired up. This is the first thing he brought up, is that Brian Robinson is going to be back helping out this offense and give us that physicality that we've been missing the last couple weeks. Zane Gonzalez had a perfect day last week in place of the injured Seibert. That was quick. Two minutes, 58 yards, touchdown, 7-0. Traffic, little mesh concept. They actually ran into each other, but eventually you see out there to the left, he's got two guys all by themselves, but he's fighting for his life. They missed a face mask call there. Looks like he got a hold of that, but a no call. But, yeah, if he would have had time to look out there, even after he ran into his own man, Devontae Smith still worked out to that flat. 21-yard attempt. If he misses this one, you'll hear a serenade like no other. But he doesn't. So he bangs it through. 21-yard attempt. They cap off an 87-yard drive, not in the manner they wanted to. and with 19 seconds left it's 7-3 and by the way we want man to kick off and seals that one through the end zone so in the weaning seconds at the 30 yard line and then Washington since they won the toss and deferred they will get the ball when we start the third quarter They have a couple of time Maybe you want to launch something here And try to get in field goal range At least they line up in a formation to indicate They may do that Go four wide here Might look for Terry McLaurin Doesn't have a target yet tonight Zero Throw it over the middle Eckler Eckler's going to get it off to the 49 yard line just like that yeah they can take a timeout and they still have another one available with 11 seconds well last time they were around this is spot at the end of the game you can't forget it and neither can Chicago The most incredible plays, not only of the year, but ever. There was Noah Brown. Sis, thank you very much, Bears, for everybody jumping up there at once. I think in this case, you still got the timeout. You try to get in field goal range. I don't think you need to. Possible. Yeah, I think you've got plenty of time here. To the outside, trying to pick up a few, but that's incomplete. Luke McCaffrey, first time they've gone his way. Rookie had a rice. second ten so they got Gonzalez who's the the kicker they picked up last week or brought him to the active roster anyway because Cybert has been having a fantastic year he was leading the league in points up until a couple of weeks ago when he got a hip injury that has showed him at least two games We'll see if Daniels can get them into that range right now. And we've got a timeout. Yeah, Philadelphia's looked at the formation, personnel grouping. They get their timeout. I thought we'd come in tonight and see Terry McLaurin involved a lot in this first half. He's always aligned on that left side for Washington. And he'd be going up against the rookie, Quinion Mitchell. I thought it'd be fun to see how those two go at it. Mitchell's had such a great start to his career, but just nothing so far. You know, it's really interesting, too. He's completed eight Panthers, has Daniels. One of them, only one to a wideout. Yeah. That's Brown, De'Ami Brown, one for four yards. And that was a screen. Right, a screen. Nothing downfield. Five to Eckler, one to Ertz, one to Robinson. Second and ten. It's fired, and that is not at the 40-yard line. The Eagles say no. The officials say you're right. The timeout is taken. How on with you? I think they may take a peek at this to see if the ball hits the surface. Oh, yeah. That's incomplete. Right. For the moment, they let it go in the 40, and now they look at it upstairs. No coaches' challenges in the last two minutes, and they'll move that baby back with the clock shows four seconds. Crowd sensing it. So now you'll get to see that Hail Mary more than likely. Maybe. Yeah. I don't think any of the secondary guys are going to bait the crowd either. Talking to the crowd. And then be the person who touches the football. After review, it was determined that it is an incomplete pass. Washington will not be charged with the timeout because this reversal... Gliding, looking, throwing, incomplete. Dotson was covered very well on the play by Jeremy Chin, who had a great game last Sunday. It'll be third down and six. Washington with Dan Quinn and Joe Witt as a defensive coordinator has obviously a reputation of being aggressive and coming after quarterbacks. Here, I think they're just kind of sitting back and kind of, at least on that last play, just playing a little bit of coverage, trying to keep everything in front of them, taking all the receivers that Jalen Hurts had away. So a win, of course, Quinn's pedigree is defense. Coordinator in Seattle when they won the Super Bowl. Third down and six. In the pocket. Time. Throws. Caught. And picking up the first out, A.J. Brown. We talked about it, Kirk, earlier in the season. Brown was hurt. Smith was hurt. And when they got back healthy, he would go on a five-game winning streak. Yeah, Kellen Moore decides to move him pre-snap. Just a little bit of movement here. And Washington, they show pressure, and then they sit back and play zone. Really good job of recognizing that zone and sitting down in the soft coverage. Quickly, they go again. And on a slant. Brown again. Brown pulling his way to the 22 line And they go quickly and Brown picks up 26 Both these teams will do a lot of tempo especially Washington And right now there's some momentum getting on this drive. Safety goes to the middle of the field and right away. That signifies to the quarterback, Jalen Hurston. He knows he's got one-on-one on the outside, gets it out of his hands quickly. And Brown's got a chance to do something after the catch. Now Barkley tried to slip away, but no. That line equal to the task there along the linebacker Jalen Holmes. Number 96, the tackle there. Loss of one, second down and 11. So Moore calling in the plays. At one point, it looked like Moore might be the ascendant at some point to be the head coach in Dallas, but then all of a sudden, things happen. He goes to the Chargers for a while now. Maybe has found a good home here. Loss of two now, second down, 12. From the 25-yard line. Extra man coming. Pressure. Hurts flushed out. And Hurts throws caught along the sideline. But a minimal gain if any right there. As Anais Smith makes the catch on a flag. Is that Adrian Hill? Is the referee. And we'll hear his voice for the first time tonight. holding offense, number 77. Ten-yard penalty remains for South. Yeah, Becton, of course, was with the Jets as a tackle. They moved him once he came to Philadelphia to that right guard spot. He's in behemoth, 363 pounds. One thing he gives up is quickness. You see, you know, Shelton Day uses that quickness to get around him and loses, the big fella loses that leverage and grabs onto him. I wondered if they would accept that because it would have been about a third and 11. Instead, they do take the penalty to push him even further back in second and 22. Yeah, interesting call. Meanwhile, you've got Dickerson trying to work his way back into playing condition on the sideline. Second and 22. Hurts looking one way, then the other. Again, the pressure is put on. At front, he's doing a good enough job on Jalen to get to him. Third down and 22, at least to force the issue. Yeah, the challenge defending this offense is the physicality with Barkley, and even the threat of Jalen Hurts in the run game. A lot of times you've got to think about getting the numbers up to stop that run game. When you do, you leave your corners on islands. This time, what they've seen a lot on this drive is a lot of coverage. Sitting back, making Jalen Hurts hold the football and respecting what A.J. Brown and Devontae Smith can do and how quickly they can get downfield. They're sitting back with too high safety, though. Third and 22, so they put Gainwell in the backfield, Send three receivers off to the right side and give it to Gainwell. Trying to pick up enough yardage to make a field goal attempt more palatable to the 25 he goes. St. Jude makes the stop there. So on fourth down at the 26-yard line, Eagles will try to make it 3-0. That's a win for Washington in their defense. The potential of this offense and what they can do with their balanced attack and how explosive they can be. The way they were moving that football after the throw to A.J. Brown. Get the holding call, push them behind the sticks, and have to make them settle for a field goal, see if they get the three points. Jake Elliott, eighth year in the league. Plucked him off the Cincinnati practice squad back in 17. And the kick is no good. Elliott has missed a few this year. Don't try that or try it for the gymnastics team at the Olympics. second in inches. Again Barkley, and this time he picks up the first down. Clock rolling three and a half to the half. St. Jude's making the tackle there, first down. You know, a lot of times when fans are at home watching, you're watching the ball, you're watching the quarterback. If you're a fan of defense, and especially instincts and wisdom, just watch 54 pre-snap and how much he's communicating and trying to make sure everybody's seeing what he's seeing. They've done it for 13 years. And that pass is contested, but Brown is able to make the catch. Forward progress close to a first down. And it is. The job by Barkley. We're talking about the job he does running and catching. This time he had to take on a block. You saw Hurts get hit. It's because of the pressure from Louvoo that Barkley has to do his best to take on. Louvoo drives him back, but he did his job. because it hurts just enough time, as you said, Al, to throw it, make the catch. Just enough yardage to pick up the first. To the outside, it goes here. That's Smith, Devontae Smith. Tackled there by Jeremy Chin. That's a very short game, second down and seven after a pickup of three. We talked all this half about how the Eagles want to run the ball to set up the pass, but not dominating the line of scrimmage. It becomes a game where maybe you have to throw more, try to soften up the coverage and try to soften up the defensive front. Maybe throw tonight against this commander's defense to set up the run. Searching for rhythm. To the ground. To Barkley. Breaking tackles to the 49-yard line. That's his superpower, that spin move. He's been doing that since his days at Penn State. Tough on a defense. Two-minute warning in Philly. Still 7-0. Commanders. What can I tell you? Look at Sherm. What? Why? Every time you hit him. On first out, here's Barkley. To the 48-yard line. So, a heavy dose of him. 13 for 53. By the way, that was the Liberty Bell, not the Liberty Bowl. All of their timeouts remain for both teams from the 48-yard line. Fired over the middle. Let's go up by Devontae Smith. And he works his way down to the 26-yard line. Popped there by Kwon Martin. What a job at the line of scrimmage. Look at his tight press coverage. A little shake and then off. He just does such a nice job. Had so much more strength than you would think when you look at him. Great route runner, but extraordinary strength when you look at his build. 21-yard gain. Clock keeps on moving. Under a minute now. Slides to a stop flag down at the 24-yard line. Adrian Hill can make the call here. Relaxing going on the side here with the teams nothing major Illegal contact defense. Number zero. That's five-year-old. The result of the play. Automatic first down. The rookie, Mikey Sainer still. And that will move the ball. With 58 seconds. trying to spot it right now they put it at the 20 so he first out of the 20-yard line Dachshund in motion keep it on the ground again Saquon picks up two. Dorrance Armstrong makes the tackle. And finally a timeout is taken with 51 seconds. Taken by Washington, trying to conserve a little time in case they stop them, so they would have a little time. They deferred the open this game up, so they do get the ball to start the second half. So the ball at the 18-yard line. And this drive now started at their own. The standings now in the east. The Eagles are 7-2. The Commanders have played one more game. They haven't had their bye yet. That comes week 14. Cowboys 3-6. And Barkley's old team at the bottom right there. The Giants are 2-8. Dan Quinn, first year as the head coach in Washington. Nick Sirianni, fourth year in Philadelphia. Took the team to the Super Bowl a couple of years back. Temperature is 45 degrees. A little breezy and chilly tonight. and Lincoln Financial Field. Washington won the toss. They have deferred. So right off the bat, Jalen Hurts will be ready to go to work. Zane Gonzalez will kick off. Austin Seibert's had a great year, but he has a hip injury, so he's out for a second straight game. And that kick will be down in the end zone. So Hurts and company go to work at the 30-yard line. and of course that five game winning streak so much good has happened to this team including to this guy 12 TD passes and 10 touchdown runs this season and of course a few of those are the tush push which of course has become a staple here likely see one tonight and meanwhile Jordan Melata comes back in he's missed some time the left tackle from Australia cementing that offensive front So the smoke from the fireworks clearing. And away we go. Barkley is in the backfield. Quick pass out to the right side. That's Dotson, the former commander. He was a first-round pick a couple of years ago, and they let him go. And he winds up here in Philadelphia where he's the number three receiver. So he picks up eight, second, and two. This Eagles team, a couple things happened during these five games that they've been able to string together. Number one, they've gotten healthier. It's good to see A.J. Brown and Devontae Smith back, Goddard back at tight end. And the other thing is they're relying, you see the left tackle, Malata. They're relying more on running the football and setting up play action with Jalen Hurts. And with a new offensive coordinator, I think they found their identity. They run more than any team in the league 55% of the time. To the outside, Hurts has to throw it away. Pressure was on that time. Barkley, the intended receiver. So it's third down and two for Philadelphia right off the bat. Kellen Moore has come in here as the offensive coordinator. He was in Dallas. Then he went to the Chargers. And he and Hurts have really clicked extremely well. Meanwhile, no huddle here. Third and two from the 38-yard line. Keep it on the ground. Barkley straight ahead. Picks up a first down. It's going to be a really good battle tonight. The way it should be when these two teams get together in the trenches, especially in the interior. Looks like Landon Dickerson slow to get up there. Left guard. So Dickerson down on his knees. Injury. Timeout for the moment. It looks like Saquon Barkley finishing that run may have rolled up on the back of his leg. He's just, of course, Barkley just trying to drive those legs and pick up the first down on a third and short. And as he gets to the end of this play, as he is right in the middle of the screen, he just rolls up on that right leg. He's walking off the field now but not putting a whole lot of weight on it. No. At least not needing any assistance along the way. Tyler Steen, second year round of Alabama, will come in and take his spot. And what we just talked about, the battle in the interior, and Dickerson has a lot to do with that as far as the leadership, especially with Jason Kelsey moving on. Cam Juergens, the center, has done a nice job, but they really rely on Dickerson to kind of set the tone there in the middle. Going to work on him in agony as he comes to the bench. Nick Sirianni pacing the sideline. And Philly on the first down from the 41-yard line. Smith in motion. Keep it on the ground. Barkley picks up about four before he is pushed back the crowd wants a flag throw him to the ground but there is no laundry second and six I found it amazing this week as we were preparing I assume Bobby Wagner he's been playing he's 34 years old he's 13th year he's bounced around and here he is in Washington being the leader in the out for the defense Saquon Barkley with New York the New York Giants, all those years. I thought they would have played, but first time these two have gone head-to-head, and Bobby Wagner maybe sent a little message there, and the first chance to bring the tackle to him. Yep, and no flag on the play. Second down and six. Four-man rush. Hurts hangs in the pocket. Stroud lets him know it. So the commanders hold, keep it scoreless, and get the ball when we come back. Thanks. Of course. Meanwhile, here's Washington. Brian Robinson is back. He's on a wing here. The running back comes back. Meanwhile, it's juggled and caught. Austin Eckler is out of bounds after a short pickup. Gain of five, make it second down to five. So there's Daniels. You know, the great thing, look at those numbers. Only two interceptions for a rookie in nine games. So here's a guy who doesn't throw into a lot of trouble or traffic. And he's only had a couple of picks, and they came in weeks four and five back-to-back. Meanwhile, you've got Robinson in the conventional running back spot here, tackled by Dean, so quickly third down and four. Dean, nice job of getting downhill on that. You know, Jayden Daniels, he's the real deal. I remember calling games when he was a freshman out of Arizona State, going up against Justin Herbert at Oregon, who was a hyped-up guy. And just showed tremendous poise even as a freshman. And I think it obviously has only gotten better. But this guy is a passer. He's a pocket quarterback who is very dynamic, obviously, with the athletic ability to create, especially on third down. Three years at ASU. Then he goes to LSU and wins the Heisman last year. In the pocket. Fires a fastball that's broken up. Zach Vaughn, who's really been tremendous this season. Four years. I don't want to say lost in the shuffle in New Orleans, but nobody's talking about him. Now, all of a sudden, he's the defensive player of the week in the NFC and having a great year. Yeah, I think he's become one of the great stories because of the way he's playing on defense with Vic Fangio. And they took a chance on him. The Kobe Dean and Zach Vaughn in the middle. You can see the instincts there. This guy's an outside linebacker his entire college career. Edge guy. Edge guy in New Orleans. Only a handful of snaps last year. It's a middle linebacker. And they rolled the dice and hoped that he could come through. and boys have paid off in a big way for Vic Fangio in this defense. Tress Way to send the puck in the direction of the rookie, DeGene. He calls for and secures a fair catch at the 9-yard line. 840 to go on a mid-40 degree night in Philadelphia. One of the premier left tackles because of how nimble and athletic he is. Here he is against Dom Cade Fowler. By the way, he has eight and a half sacks on the year. Very good pass rusher. does a nice job using the length. But I think more than anything else, just his presence, especially when Landon Dickerson went down in that opening drive. He'll be back now in the lineup at left guard. But having those two together to get back to solidifying that left side, huge for the Eagles. Yeah, there is Dickerson who went limping off, but he is back as they start this drive from their own nine-yard line. Out of the pistol this time. On the ground. He needs four yards to get 1,000, and Saquon Barkley is into four figures right now as he and Derrick Henry battle for the rushing lead. He's second to Derrick right now. It just seems like he's on a mission this year. So often you see a guy that gets into a new situation, maybe feels that he was disrespected, and he's out to show people that he's still premier back. And right now you mentioned the numbers, and there it is, over 1,000. and he's on track to have, if not maybe the best year that he's had in his career, both receiving and running the football. So enjoying it, and he doesn't even seem like he's close to being satisfied yet. And well-received in the locker room. Second and two. Here he is again fighting his way close to a first down. So the Giants let him go. Had one-year deals there. Got what he wanted here. About 13 per season. Here comes your first tush push. This will be one of many. Not quite as proficient without Kelsey, but they get the job done here. Of course, the commander's signal no, but the officials have the final call, and they will tell the guys working the sticks to move them. A lot of that has to do with, Kelsey did it better than anybody, but a lot of that has to do with, you know, now you've got Beckton in there at right guard. and he's getting down to each of his submarine. And that defensive line, you've got the guys pushing from behind. But Jalen Hurts at 225 pounds probably has his powerful legs of any quarterback in the league and certainly helps. Seven minutes left in the quarter. Nothing, nothing. In the battle for first place in the NFC East. Off the fake. Rolling right. Throwing. And that is caught. But nothing happening right there. Dallas Goddard made the catch, and Chin is all over him. Chin, 12 tackles last week and an interst... Timeout, Philadelphia. They're second. This will be a 30-second timeout. All right. Two out of 30, 67%. Now, what would be crazier? a win against Chicago or something loony happening in this game? I don't know. Well, how about if you recover the onside kick, throw another one of those Commander's Hail Marys, hit it, and then miss the two-pointer? Oh, can you? Yeah. Do you imagine that? No. It's the NFL. Anything happens. Anything happens. So again, Gonzalez is the guy that is in there temporarily before Seibert gets healthy And he can become a major hero right now Let's see what happens Here's your onside kick, here's your bouncing ball And that will secure And that is Dallas Goddard Got a big roll in this one And that big catch, fumbled, and then Calterra saved the day So they're going to put 27 seconds on the clock. I mean, Washington still has two timeouts. Only thing that could happen would be some crazy fumble on the snap. Already the congratulations on the Philly sideline. And a knee here. They'll kneel it down. No sense really calling a timeout here than they could. They'll let the clock run down. And the Philadelphia Eagles have now made it six in a row. They're starting two and two. Washington loses back-to-back for the first time this year. It's a game-and-a-half lead now in the NFC East. And Saquon Barkley. Slow start tonight. Tremendous finish. What are you having? Leading the league right now. Rushing in scrimmage yards. What a pickup. Merch and Daniels get together. They break in to fly. Eagles fly here in Philadelphia. And the Eagles soar again. 26-18. Hurts. Going to run for it. And will dive. Where are they going to spot it? Come up a little bit short. Fourth down. Percy Butler saved a first down. So now you've got a fourth down upcoming. Fourth in the yard. Yard and a half maybe. That's the first down with that extra effort there as he extends. Yeah, he's right there. They can challenge. This is back foot is elevated and his foot never touches. Yeah, that's definitely a first down. We've still won the game. First down. Yeah, it is right. Good call. We play a system upstairs. A tremendous effort, by the way, because you saw the safety Butler chasing him and using his speed. It looked like he was anticipating Hurts may take off and go. Look at that effort by both these guys. The safety, Butler trying to make a play, and then Hurts at the last second knows he's got to extend, keeps the right foot in, and then extends with the right hand to get the first. Yeah, there you have it. Ball inbounds. And still alive at that point, and enough for the first down. 38 now. Gainwell is in the backfield. Almost shut. But don't. Beck didn't flinch the right guard. That's what the reaction was from Deron Payne. Yeah, Washington was all about flinching at the line of scrimmage after last week. Here's Gainwell. Gainwell, a 14-yard game off the back of Lane Johnson. Who's only been doing this for 12 years. Old school trap here with Lane Johnson. There's the flinch that they reacted to, that the defense reacted to. It was a little movement. When you're 363 pounds, it needs to be more movement than that. What a block, though, by the right tackle, Lane Johnson, opening that play up. Big hole. Gainwell again. To the 10-yard line. He goes back-to-back. Big runs. Chin makes the stop, and that's a gain of 14. Well, they pulled the big fella and actually ate a blocking angle for Dallas Goddard there. So they're getting angles now up front, these last couple run plays. They go no huddle here. First and 10 from the 11. Through the middle again. Gainwell. To the five and maybe a little beyond. Again, Johnson. Get behind. Big Lane Johnson. Makai Becton, right side, has opened up three straight plays. Starting to impose their will up front. We've not seen a lot of that tonight. We expected it. We really thought that Philadelphia could have an advantage. That's what they've been doing during this five-game win streak. But Washington has held their own until these last few plays. McGainwell, three good runs. Now Barkley is back in there. Gainwell out. Second and three. Barkley. In two. No to the one-yard line. Crowd thought he got it. Officials say no. Dickerson leading the way. The left guard pulling. But now you're in a situation. You know what's coming next. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. How about not only is Dickerson pulling around, with the center, Cam Juergens. We used to see Jason Kelsey do that so often. The knee touches down. Even the elbow is down. Okay, here comes your brotherly shove. Everybody knows what's coming. Hurts, can he get in? He is. Touchdown. That's a 76-yard drive. 11 plays and Philly has the lead for the first time how about you know it's coming you just can't stop it Frankie Lou who we've been talking about all night you'll see him just jump he just jumps right there and trying to do anything the problem is he's underneath all of that and easily gets into the end zone good push once again up front led by Cam Juergens the only team that's really been able to stop it this year is Green Bay and they had to go to Brazil to do it on opening day. Stopped them twice. Elliott to the point after. Philadelphia makes Dan Quinn and Washington pay for that chance that they took. Watch the right tackle with a great kickout block here by Lane Johnson. The entire right side here really does their job. Also the center, Cam Juergens, creating that wall. Once Lane Johnson had the kickout block, there was really nobody left there on the right side. And the extra point, which is pretty important here, is just good. just be Molly the icing on the cake for Barkley he now has a hundred yards tonight and there's the last few 19 gently one tight end saving the bacon of the other touch back here Washington at the 30-yard line next. This Jalen Carter in his second year is capable of taking games over. Just what these coaches call a game record. No matter who's playing the Eagles, Vic Fangio, they're going to look up and say, where's 98? He's gotten comfortable. He knows his role. They're taking advantage of him just being a menace on the inside. He does it against the run. He's involved in the pass. He cannot be blocked one-on-one. I think one of the top interior defensive lineman in the National Football League right now. That number one overall pick last year. So, Commanders down by nine. Daniel Spires over the middle. And is Reed Blankenship, who for the moment has awarded the interception. And they're going to go celebrate. Of course, they'll take a peek at it. The smiling Sirianic. And Daniels, of all things, on the first play down by nine, is picked off. Here it is again. That's a catch. Pretty clear. This is Jayden Daniels trying to make a play. I think he's staring down his receiver the whole way, and Blankenship just kind of waiting for the ball to be thrown, and then just steps in front of him. But this is a defense that I think has gained confidence throughout the night. They've done a heck of a job with Vic Fangio of mixing up the looks, confusing the quarterback. And tonight, reminding all of us, as good as he is and as bright as his future is, tonight he's looked like a rookie quarterback against a veteran defensive coordinator. Eagles having some fun down there now. For sure. Well, Blankenship now has three of their seven interceptions this season. Daniel's only throwing his third. Here's Barkley. Picks up a few more. So he's already into triple figures. Second down and four game is six. We go to Kaylee. Well, and guys, that pick makes 11 takeaways in the last four games. And just before this surge began, inside linebackers coach Bobby King showed the defense flips of surfers hitting big waves. He was telling them, we've got to catch the wave. Because after just two takeaways in the first six games, Zach Vaughn told me, now they have caught that wave. You see how excited Bobby King is right now. Wow. That's something I never heard of that before. Surfing movies? Yeah. I guess the surfing movies outweigh the sharp ones. It does. He goes inside. Linebacker coach. Daniel's sitting next to Ertz who is putting an arm around him. A little bit of a consolation. Saying, man, you're going to have days like this. But down by nine now in the battle for first place. Barkley! Does he have another one? yes he does touchdown nine yards for the touchdown last three drives they have been unstoppable and Saquon now all of a sudden 146 yards That's why it's a 60-minute game. Look at that energy. When's the last time you saw Saquon Barkley have that kind of energy? And just for fun, the guy that replaced Jason Kelsey, he's having a pretty good year. Playing pretty physical. He just body slams the safety trying to come up there. And Saquon Barkley, you've got to play 60 minutes to stop this guy, even if he's off to a slow start. He and his offense will just keep coming after you. What's funny, 146 yards, it's only his fourth highest yardage total on the ground. He's out of reach, but both sides are competing. C.J. Gardner-Johnson, again, kind of reading the eyes, gets a good jump on it, almost gets in front. That's a battle of two. Four hands, two sets of hands fighting for that football. These two teams will see each other again before the end of the season in Landover. Reset the play clock, says Adrian Hill. On a second down and goal. So Washington will go to 7-4, and the Eagles are going to go to 8-2, and that will be caught for a touchdown. So Zach Ertz, who will always be written into the lore of the Eagles, the big touchdown in the Super Bowl against New England. Quinn says, let's go for a pair. Well, you get it, obviously, onside kick. Yeah. Well, you never know. You never know. You're right. I mean, you think about what Jaden Daniels did against Chicago. Still have two timeouts. Just saying. And the timeout is not called by Sirianni. Timeout in Philadelphia. Hey, listen, you don't want to give this up. Fool around and don't recover the onside kick and have Daniels do his miracle thing again. So league-wide this year, the onside kick has worked twice. Two of 30. Mm-hmm. So, again, so you're saying there's a chance. Well, I'm saying there's a chance. You've got to hit this two-pointer first. Yeah. 7% chance. I'm saying 4.36 expected. Next gen. Love that. 4.38? I'm the last gen. What do you want me to tell you? Here's a two-point try here. Daniels rolling, trying to get rid of it. Looking downfield. Can somebody get open? No. That opened but out of bounds. 0.00 chance. 0.01 against expected. Nobody was able to work with the quarterback. Good effort there by Ertz. That's worth another look. Does he have possession of the football? That's Cooper DeGene. He definitely had this ball. I want to see his feet. Okay. Possession. Wow. Wow. If that right foot, the left foot's down, is that right foot down when he possessed that ball? Terry McCauley, what are you seeing? Yeah, Al, it looks like that right toe just touches the ground before he goes down. I think this is good. Well, not yet. Adrian Hill just announcing this is under review. Beyond that? Look at this guy. Look at the effort. 34-year-old guy, former Eagle. Yep. I didn't even think he could see the ball with Dejean in his way. Not only does he see it, he catches it. And with his body falling. Wow. At least gave himself a shot here to get those feet down. We ain't done yet. Al, that's our best shot right there. Very clearly touches. This should be good. Wow, that's going to make it 26-18 onside kick to go. That's when you say don't touch that dial, but I'm streaming. What do you do? I don't know. Malibu Kelly Hayes, what do you do? What do you do? Jork knows. I don't know. Do you know? I really don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody knows anything. so Adrian he'll look at this if he's seen what we're seeing it's going to be 26-18 with an onside kick yeah that's a catch yes it is got the feet down we've got an 8 point ball game here after a review it was determined that the receiver had both feet in bounds maintain control of the ball that is a serious That is amazing. Don't log off. It's not being told, right? I'm going to enjoy Jill right here. Good call. Well, I know we're back to about 3.3%. I think we are back. Okay, so now you've got Gonzalez. He's going to try to onside kick it, recover it. Now you've got a timeout called. as they can play offensively, and they won 26-10. That's Jeremy McNiggles. Well, yeah, three points at halftime. I mean, you go back a month and a half. Remember, last year, of course, you have the meltdown. You talk about they were going to be the number one seed, and they wound up becoming a wild card and getting blown out in the wild card round. Complete meltdown at the end. That pass is caught. That's hurts on the outside. So you can't assume anything these days. go from 10-1 to that. And then, you know, we'll see what happens. But, you know, it's funny. A month and a half ago, they're ready to make Sirianni a piñata, ready to burn the stadium down, right? They're 2-2. They look terrible against Tampa Bay. But don't you think the experience last year, sitting there at 10-1 and losing those games and limping into the wild card game and getting embarrassed by Tampa, the fan reaction, the changes they made starting 2-2, I just think it's made them tougher. I think it's made them a team that, you know, you can get through nights like this when things aren't working. You find ways to win games. I mean, that's what great teams do. Well, and, of course, there's a change in coordinators. Yeah. Two different words. I mean, Fangio. They wanted Nick. They wanted Fangio to come in here. Nick, last year, couldn't get him. He had already signed with Miami. And then that didn't work out. Then it became available, and they pounced on it. Third and five. And this will be a fourth down play coming up here. McNichols again. Block running down to the two-minute warning. Yeah, last year in Miami, I just don't know if that was a fit as far as Vic Fangio and Miami and their defense. I don't know if that's a veteran defense. I don't know if they ever quite completely bought in to what he was teaching. And I think this is a young Eagles defense. It's going to him every week with, give us the wisdom. What do we need to do? How can you help us? They want to learn. They're like, a lot of them are just sponges wanting to listen to what he can offer up to them. And I think they've all bought in. And I think the results speak for themselves. Two-minute warning. And we can tell you, yes, we can, the JCPenney postgame show exclusively on Prime Video with Carissa and that Fable gang. Where do you think they're heading tonight? I go to my next stop after the game. They keep going. Right. You'll be in Athens later tonight, and they'll be, you know, I don't know. Liberty Bell. They already went to that last night. What do you got? How about you brought this up to me this week. The NFC East haven't had a repeat winner in the last 19 years. Dallas won last year, so it's going to be 20 years. Longest streak, NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, WNBA, MLS, high school. I mean, you name it. There's never been a league 20 straight years. Right. You have a different winner. It's going to happen again this year. No back-to-back. Last time it was done, the Eagles did it, 1-0-4. Yeah. Four years in a row. So fourth and two. crowd smelling blood I mean the game is over but they're roaring on a fourth and two Daniels fires and that will be enough for a first down Zach hurts again so the X Eagle has now bought five hurts that time running on fourth down getting beyond the first down marker that was a route last week it was a bit short against the Steelers. Noah Brown. As you look at Washington and you picture this franchise continuing to grow, the next natural step for them is going to continue to put pieces around Jaden Daniels. I mean, Terry McLaurin's a big-time one receiver, but I think they're still kind of searching as they grow for that second and third option to become difference makers if they can find them. Pass is good on the outside. Here, McNichols. Third down. You saw Quinn on the sideline. Hey, let's get into the end zone. Let's leave with something. With something. With anything. Third and five. Daniels escapes. That pass is pulled in at the six-yard line. That's Zaccheaus. Making it the first and goal. Well, 36 total points. I'd like to tell you something's in play here, but it's not. I appreciate that. Just in case. Always got to put a button on it. And that's broken up and incomplete. Gardner Johnson got a great jump on that. Almost came up with an interception. Like you said, this game is field. He plays it almost like a linebacker with his instincts. and then you mix in the power and the quickness that he has to go with it. This guy really now in his second year starting to take control of the interior of this defense. Third down, one. With three tight ends here. Robinson in the backfield. Robinson, no serve. So now he's got a fourth down coming up with eight and a half left in regulation. You've got Graham there. You've got Vaughn there. In fact, they lost the yard fourth and a deuce. And again, there was such rhythm to this drive until that play. He even looked back at Robbins City. It just looked like it was a little bit slow and deliberate, and it gave Philadelphia a chance to dig their cleats into the ground there and get off the ball. You saw Gonzalez, if they don't get a yard here, he's got about a 43-yard attempt to take the lead. Oh boy, juggled it. Lucky came away with it. And then he gets slammed out of bounds short of the first down. At first it looked like he was going to fumble it. Vaughn hits him. And it's Daniels, and look at that. Lucky even got it. I am a force. Kicking the doors. Stopped off of this. Off to the edge. Really good job there. The one question I have is Noah Brown. He's blocking Slay, who ends up making a tackle, and he felt pressure from the inside from Blankenship, so he tries that block. Not able to make that block, and you called it on the live call. The play never really had a chance there. The ball gets away. Carter's in the backfield. He's just trying to improvise to make a play. What would that have been about a 40? 44-yard field goal. To take the lead. Right. On the fourth and two could have taken the lead. And even though Gonzalez is the picker who came in for sovereignty, hasn't missed a kick in two weeks. Already made one earlier from 45. Right. Perfect last week against Pittsburgh. There's Barkley, who's now carried 22 times for 76 yards. Big point in the game here. Washington rolls the dice. Chance to take the lead. Dan Quinn gets aggressive. Play blows up. Now Washington relying on their defense. Try to get Jaden Daniels the ball back. And Billy a chance to work some clock here. Off the fake. Finally has a ton of time and wide open. catches May. Goddard loses the ball, but the Eagles are there to recover it. Knocked out by Kwon Martin, and Goddard lost the ball, and then Grant Calcaterra saves the day. Does he ever? Does he ever. Effort there. Look, the ball gets away from his body. Smart play there to knock that football away by Martin. Looks like the commander's got a shot, but Calcaterra right where he needs to be to help his teammate out. Washington's underneath coverage took all the underneath routes led by Saquon Barkley, opened it up for him to go over top. Now they go to their workforce again. Stop at the line of scrimmage or maybe a few inches beyond second down. Goddard and Calviteria, good buddies. I'm sure they'll be talking about that one after the game. Goddard just trying to make a play. Appreciate the effort. Ball just got away from his body, and commanders are in that mode. They're trying to knock anything they can away from the Eagles. Under six minutes. Left in regulation, second down, nine. and and and fires contested and that's ground ground on the outside there same result making the grab doing a good job tonight but that game is six yards in the third down and three interesting call here because they got positive yards third and three up by two in field goal range with a shaky kicker. You wonder what kind of play call you go with here just to potentially set up. They get to that fourth and one, one and a half. You know they're always confident in how they can pick up that first down. See the call is on the ground. And a first down. And a ton more. Barkley. Touchdown. Up against the rookie out of TCU, Brandon Coleman. Lined up really far to the outside to be able to create that opportunity to bend underneath him, use his quickness. He's a little bit undersized at this level, but because he is so quick and so aggressive, he's able to win. And that time he got around him there on third down. Great play. Dress way with his fifth punt of the night. Cooper DeGene standing back at his 15-yard line. the gene waiting has room for the 13 and runs it back to the 24-yard line two and a half left in the third in a four-point game on Thursday night football first and ten from the 24-yard line Dotson was the man in motion there goes Barkley Barkley spinning Barkley might have enough for a first down getting out to the 34-yard line so Saquon tonight has carried 19 times for 70 yards they spot him a yard shy second down and one Big to him. Smith, Devontae Smith. Has enough for the first down. Sensing that was a personal foul. It was Frankie Louvoo. Legal tackle right there. First down. Yeah, that's where Jalen Hurts has the option. Either run that or get it to the outside. He's got the numbers out on the perimeter. Three against two. And makes a good decision just to get it to Devontae Smith. That's what the crowd reacted to. They thought that might have been a late hit. No, sir. First down, 34-yard line. Three receivers set to the right. Now one comes into the slot. The other is in motion to the left. Hurts. Chase. Throws. Caught. Brown. 50-yard line. To the Washington 48-yard line. egos. So Brown was able to work himself free for the minute to go 17 yard gain. That's a great word work because he's to our right and he has to work to help Jalen Hurts all the way over once the quarterback starts to run. He mirrors him and eventually they're able to hook up for that first down. Hurts is now thrown for 180 yards. Throws to the outside. Smith wheels around crowd there's a flag coming in crowd sensing a face mask Frankie Lugu was there officials conferring with each other to see exactly what the issue is maybe got the helmet opening here looks like it this is why it's always good to have a little conference one guy sees it one way the other guy sees it the other way Terry, what are you seeing? Yeah, as Kirk said, if he gets the helmet opening, then that's just like the face mask and would be a 15-yard penalty. You know, it's not perfectly clear. Yeah, it looks like it's underneath the helmet. Here's a good look at it, Terry, right there. This is the opening. Yeah, that's the helmet opening. they should have left the flag down. But they don't. Well, there's your reaction. Crowd agrees with Terry. You think? Well, they wind the clock at second down and seven as the quarter is ready to expire on the second and seven from the 45-yard line. Barkley. Uh-uh. It'll be third down. See that last guy, that fanboy, he was worked up. Yeah, tell me about it. That's the end of the quarter. The score, 10-6. Washington back in Philly after this. Pockets tonight. Actually, I would have thought it was even more than that. Three sacks, three hurries on Daniels, Hurts. Two sacks, two hits, two hurries. You're right. It seems like a lot more, doesn't it? And every opportunity counts. I mean, you're into the fourth quarter, a game that's been not the prettiest for either one of these offenses. Philadelphia now in plus territory, down four points. Need to capitalize on every chance they get. This is a third and seven. He's in. Think about that. Look at his eyes. I haven't seen him look like this in a long time. He's on a mission. extra point this time is right down the middle 438 to go in regulation of Philadelphia Eagles trying to make it six in a row you're killing us stop it I'll put him down there with the offensive line every running back should do let's talk about this offensive line some new faces up there Dickerson Went down with an injury, came right back to next series. Nate Johnson having a Pro Bowl type of year. Cam Juergens has done a good job. We talked about him a lot tonight. The center, Makai Beckton moving from left. Tackled most of his career in New York. Now back in Philly playing guard. There's Juergens just body slamming his safety. Sending an attitude and a beneficiary all year to the way those guys play up front. It's been for Saquon Barkley. And there's one of the best line coaches who's been doing it a long time. Jeff Stoutman. Him and he and Dante Skarnecchia, a long time in New England. When you think about it, Alex Gibbs years ago, Denver. How important have those guys been to their teams through the years? Think about when you lose a Jason Kelsey, right? I mean, you kind of lose potentially the heart and soul. And, you know, they've had Milata has been out, comes back tonight. You know, and they've just had to bob and weave. And now that they're healthy, they're showing what they're capable of. second and three actually makes that cast it goes nowhere clock continues to run born makes the tackle clock running down to four minutes left in regulation and the commanders are one having mine on third down the house of course leads to a lot of punch and trust way is took five of them already third and two Daniels throws flag is thrown that's one handed for the moment by Earth but then he says no check out the flag And the answer is... All right. Third down. You know, this defense, they allowed the one touchdown early in this game. You add up since they've been on this run of winning five in a row, now it's going to be six in a row. Six and O these last six weeks allowed five touchdowns total as a defense in those six weeks. So the pass to Earth was good for four yards, and that's enough for a first down. And that pass is incomplete. So all night long goes to Zaccheaus that time. So Daniel 16 to 25. But again, you go back to the 16 completions. McVangio, another masterful performance. And only two of them. One to McLaurin for 10 yards. One to Deami Brown for two yards. The only wideouts to catch passes tonight. Yeah. The job that this defense has done really all year, especially the last six weeks, has been extraordinary. And that pass is incomplete a lot of talk about big fan Joe when we got a penalty down it right at the quarterbacks back in the backfield there Personal foul walking the pastor defense, number 97. 15-yard penalty, automatic, first out. You know, you look at Washington's schedule. Four of their last six are at home. Got a bye week, week 14 as well. Two games, well, one of the two games with Philly is tonight. Two against Dallas. And there's a, you see the foul right there. Meanwhile, Philly gets to play four of their last five at home, and their last two against the Giants and the Cowboys. How's that looking for them? Everybody's just almost assuming Detroit's going to be the one seed coming out of the NFC, but you look at Detroit's schedule and Philly's schedule. I mean, Philly's sitting here at 8-2 with 7 to go, so they still have a lot of games ahead of them and games that they're going to have a chance to continue to win. Listen, they didn't play their greatest tonight offensively. They found ways to get it done late. Offensive line took over, but this is about as bad. And, oh, boy, I'm telling you. No. Wow. With exactly 12 minutes, two missed field goals and a missed extra point. And the serenade begins. 12-10. Eagles. His first field goal attempt, wide left. Oh. This second field goal attempt. Wide left. Yep. Now you get an extra point. Hello again, everybody. Oh, my gosh. So there's seven points that never made it to the scoreboard. My guy, Pat McAfee, texted me saying we have better kicks with his kicking contest than what he's doing right now. On game day, Eckler back to the 30. Well, let's take a look at a matchup that we're excited to see, and that's Terry McLaurin against the rookie Quinone Mitchell. We thought this would be a battle all night, but 17 doesn't have an opportunity yet. It's been a lockdown. Mitchell has done a good job. He's pressed it. He's mixed up the different looks. He's been on quite a bit. Played some zone, played some man. This is according to our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Look at the numbers. Matched up on 11 of the new 15 routes. 27.3% press rate for Al. And you can see zero targets so far. That part we can understand. It says here, right? Yeah, it says right here. Whatever. Daniels throws. That's caught. Nine-yard game. That's John Bates. First time they've gone his race. Number two tied in behind Ertz. He's in a nine. Remember, this is a Washington team that had a lead in the second half last week. He and Pittsburgh, they were up 10. Had a lead late in the game, unable to close it off. Here they are now on the road a week later against Philadelphia. Want to play with the big boys. You've got to finish these games off. Robinson picks up enough for a first down. Tackled there by Brandon Graham, 11-20, and took him down in regulation. And remember, you go back to 22. This team, this is Vic Fangio, excited about the way his defense has been playing all year. This Eagles team since 22, 19-5. In one possession games. That's the best in the NFL. They know how to win these kind of close games. Big fans, you a man who has been there, done that, and seen it all. Under pressure, and the pass is dropped. He got it a little bit in a hurry. That's Bates again who made the last catch, but not that one. Josh Sweat put the heat on, second and ten. He's trying to wait until the last second, and he's got the ability to throw these unusual, you know, when he's off balance, changing the arm angle, throws, but he's fallen back on a lot of the throws. In Philadelphia with Vic Fangio, they've come up with some ways to get him disrupted, but he's just got to play a tick faster than he has most of the night when he's been throwing the football. Second and ten. And that is caught in Eagle territory. They go to Ertz. So once again, it's a tight end or a back that he goes to. He's completed 11 tonight, only one to a wideout. Kobe Dean's got to be able to read the eyes of Daniels. He's kind of waiting for the back Robinson to come out of the backfield. A little bit late in getting out to the seam. Rolling, throwing along the sideline. And finally, McLaurin targeted and makes the grab. Instead of on the left, move him over to the right to go up against another rookie, Cooper DeGene. And back-to-back throws where you see Jaden Daniels throwing the ball with authority. Balls out faster, balls crisper, giving his receivers a much better chance to make a play. So McLaurin, 48 catches, stops on the team. His first one tonight. And a first down. Off the fake. To the outside they go here. And this time it is John Bates again. So the number two tight end has scored a couple. The number one tight end, Hurts, has scored one. It's been tight ends on this drive. Bates hasn't made many plays all year in the past game. He is a physical blocker. And I think the last couple plays, I think that Philadelphia's defense, it's almost like they're not even anticipating him being involved in the route. Both times he was open. And a good job again. And once again, Daniels' third throw in a row where the ball comes out quick. Yeah, Baines had caught only three coming into the game all season. Robinson, no. Met in the backfield that time. Jalen Carter makes him down. You feel that Carter's becoming one of the best interior defenders there is right now in the NFL. See that? How he uses his hands, eyes in the backfield.
