 Can anybody else make a play here and get separation and find a soft spot in the zone? Second down and goal. On the ground, finding some room. Good tough running. Isaiah Pacheco angry with the ground. Takes it to the three-yard line. It'll be third down and goal. Tooney came around and took out Jonathan Cooper there. opened it up nicely, got up underneath that block. If the passing game is not in rhythm down here, it's the good thing about the Chiefs, they can't turn to that line. Interior and Pacheco run the football. Kelsey's slot left. He is phenomenal in the red zone. They go the other way, caught for a touchdown. Kadarius Toney into the end zone. So they finally break through. 7th play, 62 yards, and 322. Valdez Scantling does a good job of just kind of getting in the way of the slot corner. McMillan just kind of slows his route down, creates just enough of a pick there to get him out to the edge. And with relative ease, Mahomes finally is able to get the touchdown here. Tony's first touchdown of the season meanwhile a flag before the snap false start offense number 65 it's a 5 yard penalty it's still the try Tony was the guy Giants had such high hopes for him first round pick in 2021 and they said we've kind of seen enough at this point Well, he had the knee surgery in July that slowed him down. He's had a sprained toe that slowed him down. But they really hope as he gets healthy, he can be a difference maker for him. It's a 38-yard extra point into the crosswind. No problem there. 3.06 remaining in the first half. And the Kansas City Chiefs now lead the Broncos 10-0 at Arrowhead. Next Thursday night. Butters kick. Another touchback. And we'll see what Wilson can get. Something, if anything, he's got, he's 5-7 for 17 yards. The first drive like we've seen most of this year the scripted start with Sean Payton nine plays held the ball over five minutes the last three drives His three plays and out started at their own 25 their own seven and their own five This is a important opportunity to try to answer for this offense Kansas City is going to get the ball to start the second half Rolling right. Knocked down. Well, no chance on that one. George Carlapis right there. Easy knockdown. Another one we're talking about, Kansas City, over the past couple of years. Leading the league by a lot. He passes knockdown to the line of scrimmage. He's not coming up with a ton of sacks, but he's doing a really good job in his second year of getting more pressures. This time, again, not able to get the pressure. But keep in mind, Russell Wilson listed at 5'11", maybe 5'10". 10. One of the big focus points that this defense had with Chris Jones and Karloftis is getting hands up and batting balls down. And it's nine knockdowns for Karloftis in a year and a half. To the 31 and a little bit more as he gets shoved out to the 34-yard line goes Williams. So it'll be third down, third and two. And Williams had the ACL week four last year so just about a year ago. He's had a quad that held him out of week four. You see the downs, the interception, a couple punts. Third down, two. Bronx two with five on third down. 220 to the half. McLaughlin is the back. Wilson rolls out. Looking to run. Can't. 30-yard line right there. Drew Tranquil strips him up. Fourth down. He tried to secure the edge, but they take away a potential receiver. They go to. Mahomes. Mahomes to the 42-yard line. Now he's going to take that time out. He gets hit there by McMillan. and Bucker and his gang ready to come back out. So at this point you're looking at about a 60 yard field goal. Mahomes talking to the secondary from Denver. I don't think he appreciated that hit neither did the crowd. Watch him as he starts to go down here. He takes a hit right there from McMillan. See him in fact get up right away and just kind of look at the ref like what's going on here? Crowd wanted a flag. Here's a 60-yard field goal attempt into a wind. It's a swirling wind. I mean, there's no prevailing wind inside most stadiums. Same situation here. You get the flags going in every direction. Geez, just a one-yard attempt. Bunker hit a 62-yarder here last year. That was his career long. Tommy Townsend to put it down. And Bunker's kick is good. And good by plenty. Whoa. Ten easy McGee in this breeze. 13 zips coming up after the break. State Farm Halftime Show with Carissa and the gang from Kansas City. Last three on a 60-yard field goal attempt. And Mahomes and company to the 25. We go to Kaylee. Well, Al, Sean Payton came here well aware his team has not played well in the third quarter. He said, now is the time we have got to start. He said, prepare for this offense to open it up a little bit. He showed me his call sheet, and that thing was marked up top to bottom. The Chiefs defense is going to keep making it tough on him, though. Andy Reid told me he likes the pressure his guys have been bringing up front, and he wants them to keep on bringing it. As the Chiefs get the ball back here, you remember, they started 0-3 in the red zone. Andy Reid said, I just goofed it. I'll take all that as my call. All right. One of the rare times. Andy will take the blame there. He'll take the blame, but it's not his fault. Usually there isn't any blame to take, right? They're so successful. But I do find that very, very unusual and comforting why this team is where they are. When Andy Reid will fall on a sword. Mahomes, everybody wants to ask about the receivers. He's like, I've got to be better. They're a big part of the culture. They're most well-known brands always deflecting the attention and accepting the blame. Second and four. Catch is made. First down is made. Pacheco. It's so funny, Kirk, because you've got a couple of teams, Kansas City and Philadelphia. Philadelphia undefeated. Kansas City 4-1. And the guys said, you know, we can play so much better. Well, yeah, I guess. But 5-0 and 4-1 are pretty good. Yeah, it's not a bad start. But I think you can see this Kansas City. Can't you envision them where they're going to be? You get around Thanksgiving, into December, into January. Once these receivers in the homes get in sync and get more reps together, it's just a matter of time. They keep 87 healthy. Pacheco. Got a three-yard game. Alex Singleton making the tackle there. There is Kelsey tonight. he's been targeted seven times. He's caught seven. 109 yards and the long gain was that 40 yarder down the right sideline. Let's see if we get one of those Travis routes they call him. I love that. It's basically like you and 15 to go figure it out. Oh sure. Let's see if we can get open by 10 yards. Second and eighth. Looks one way, comes the other. Clips it out here. Edwards Allaire. And he has room enough so he picks up the first down before he's bumped out by Josie Jewell. This is great. I'm watching him on his route, and I said, let's see if he figures out nonchalantly how to get open. So instead of figuring out where to get open, he tells Mahomes where to go with the football. He basically just says, I don't have the leverage. This isn't going to work out for me. Watch what he does here out at the top of his route. He's waiting for the defense, reading the linebackers, and then he puts his right arm like, nope, let's go out here. Give him an assist there for that completion in first. That's what the guy's doing on the street. Kelsey, catch number eight. Kelsey. Wilson, five out of six, but for 17 yards. Spread them all out. And the fullback burden wide to the left. Passes tipped and incomplete. Galaptis, George Galaptis, number 56, backs it. Fourth down. Initially show pressure up the middle with Bolton, and he ends up dropping out, and the pressure comes from here. Balls out quickly. They're anticipating with Spags on the other side. You know you're going to get some kind of look. Karloftis, very athletic edge player. Good job of getting his hand up. Casey, 34 passes, knocked down the line of scrimmage over the last few years. Most in the league. Dixon's punt. A good one. Drop. And then recovered at the 38-yard line by Montreux Washington. So six and a half to go in the half. Weird one. 3-0 Kansas City, 52-yard boot. And it's been a good start for Travis Kelsey. Just the chemistry between he and Patrick Mahomes, always on display. Often when he starts to step up or move around. What's so impressive is how Kelsey just looks around, finds leverage, and goes the other way and finds a soft spot. so often we see 15 to 87. Five targets on the night, five catches, 77 yards, but yet to get it into the end zone. So now Mahomes and company go to work. 141 total yards, but only three points. Stepping up, fires. Belski again. He's unstoppable in the 50-yard line. He goes. Another first down. Six catches. He already has 89 receiving yards. I think the biggest concern that Vance Joseph's had tonight is his linebackers are very good against the run, but there's a lot of space in an area that you knew Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes would want to attack is in that area, right in front of the safeties and between those linebackers, just finding the soft spot, and they've been able to do that. 89 yards, the receivers only 26 yards collectively. How do you think the ankle is holding up? Noah Gray. He makes that grab there, second and four. I think when you're here in Kansas City for a couple days and you prep for get ready, all you're hearing about, how you even brought it in the open, is what's going on with the receivers. We know about Kelsey, and you know about Mahomes. We know about Pacheco in the run game, but are the receivers going to be okay? And it seems like ever since Tyreek Hill left, that was the question. It drove them and motivated them to a Super Bowl championship a year ago. Mahomes is very confident that this group eventually will get it. A little flip here, Pacheco. And he takes it inside the 30-yard line. A little lateral there, a rush for 15 yards. And for Pacheco now, he's carried eight times for 41 yards, five for Tote. They bring some pressure, and he gets right outside of it. Great time to call that. Just a quick sweep, ball to the perimeter as quickly as you can. and Pacheco, he has room to work and gets downhill. He is very, very gifted and tough to bring down. All right. It's hot. 47. 47. Go, go. Ready, ready. Play action from the 28. Caught. Juggled. Holds on. Kelsey again. Sertan is there at a certain point. How do you stop him? How do you stop him? Well, you put Sertan on him, right? That's how you stop him. Here's the corner, your best cover guy, one of the best in the league. And I said, forget these receivers. Let's put two on 87. He'll take care of it. Better coverage, but a good job of running away from it. Look at the location of the football out in front where the big man can bring that one in. Davis Swift watching have another hell of a night already. 109 receiving yards. First and goal from the nine. Mahomes buys time and then just throws that one halfway to Independence. Second and goal. Up to this point, they've been able to move the ball pretty quickly. But as you said, the last time they were down in this area, three times down in the red zone and just the three points. Vance Joseph tightening things up. Windows, obviously, any time you get down here, they get tighter. But Kelsey off to the right. House on a 68 degree Thursday night. Harrison Flecker to kick off. Marvin Mims Jr., the very speedy rookie, will let it bound through the end zone and the Broncos begin play at the 25-yard line. So Russell Wilson, 10 years in Seattle, including two Super Bowl appearances, a Super Bowl victory. Bad year last year, much better this year. 5-1 touchdown interception ratio and he's run for 119 yards. 34 years old in his 12th year, second year as you mentioned in Denver. I'll tell you, you could argue he's down 15 pounds. He feels like he's in the best shape of his career and he'll need it tonight. He's going to have to use his legs to avoid the pressure. Handed off to the rookie McLaughlin and what a story this kid has become. That's a nine yard gain for a guy who was the all time leading rusher in college football played at Notre Dame, not that Notre Dame, played at Notre Dame College in Euclid, Ohio, and then wound up at Youngstown State, and he has been great. Unbelievable. This is what makes the NFL what it is. You think you know, and then all of a sudden a guy shows up that nobody expected anything from, and four or five weeks in, he becomes one of the great stories in the league. He's out. Javante Williams, who missed last week's game, he was inactive, and Michael Burton, the fullback, will take it, so he'll pick up the first down on a second and one. You know, Sean Payton tonight with his plan, I mentioned in the open, taking some shots downfield, and that's, over his career, that's what Russell Wilson does so well, but also gotta believe that Coach Payton's looking at possessing the ball and the ability to run the football against Kansas City and keeping number 15 in red on the sideline. And now he has Samaji Pirine in the backfield, so we've seen all three running backs in the backfield, and the pass is caught, and that is Cortland Sutton. We'll see where they spotted a little bit short by inches of a first down. Trent McDuffie making the tackle on the play. Beyond the numbers, just watching him play, and even before we start the prep for this week, wouldn't you say that it just looks like it's more rhythmic? The ball's coming out a little faster than we saw last year where at times he's holding the ball hesitant, unsure. So far, I think he and Sean Payton, great collaboration on coming up with a plan to make him better. Big difference. Take Dawson in. That is smelled out perfectly. Sniffed out that time. Jerry Judy makes the catch. But Shamari Hunter is right there to stop him, setting up third down to two. One of the things that, you know, last year, I can remember that there was a discussion about the wristband and Nathaniel Hackett talking to Russell Wilson about maybe using the wristband. and he declined, and this year with Sean Payton, you can see I don't know if that was necessarily a discussion or a debate. It was, here's what we're going to do, because this offense is very wordy, a lot of verbiage, and I think it helps him with the operation of the plan. Play clock got reset to 25. Big Quinn Bailey, another tackle on the left-hand side here. There he is in motion. Running back is Javante Williams. He looks for room, and he's able to back through, pick up the first half, and get into Kansas City territory. So they stopped him. Nick Bolton did, who's missed the last three games behind the line of scrimmage. But he scrambles free, picks up the first. You see the two tight ends, and see that extra tight end is just really another tackle. It's just man on man, and they actually get off the blocks. They're in a position there. Bolton, who's their best tackler, it's great to see him back. That tackle was made right there. Then he is short of the first down, but Javante Williams, back from that injury, is a physical runner, as you see right there, breaking through. Keep it on the ground. Williams again, missed last week's with a quad injury out of North Carolina. Second round pick back in 21. And now one of the things Sean Payton is known for, obviously, is not only the great offense he put together in New Orleans with Drew Brees, but a lot of personnel changes, a lot of different formations. He's had a lot of success this year following that 12-15 play script of mixing up a lot of different looks, trying to affect the defense, their communication, to see how they line up here early in this game. McLaughlin back in. They've been very good, the Broncos have, on their opening drives this season. So far so good. This time stuffed at the line of scrimmage. Nowhere to go. Willie Gay making the tackle. It'll be third down and seven as they look at Spagnuolo's defense. He'll be proud of this. Free to complain. That's his first pick this season. Simmons has been with the Broncos for eight years. And Sam the other day, man, he's just sick of losing. A little cut back there. And the ball is out. Is it out after the play was over is the question. Of course, Kansas City thinks it was. The officials come in and go new. McLaughlin. Now they do say it is a fumble. So they'll check that baby out. Drew Tranquil. And we're going to bring, they're going to review this because all turnovers. It looked like his backside was down. the ball came out. That ball's held on very... Looks like he had possession of that football. Unless he lands on an arm, his backside is down. It's third down. Yeah, they already... And short. Okay. Hockley already announced this, so he got the word from above that it was not a fumble. And they get away with it here with two minutes to go in the quarter. But he's a little short of the first down, so it's third down and one. Great job there by the officials coming together. Making that the right call. Why screw around? I mean, you know, why review it when you get the word from upstairs? It's simple. The pitch clock in baseball makes it much easier. Whatever. Third down and one. Javante Williams is a running back. And Wilson will sneak ahead over the right guard to pick up a first down. So what do you think, when you looked at Russell Wilson playing last year, we saw him once against Indianapolis. Yeah, did we? What did you think was the difference between what he was in Seattle and what they tried to do with him last year? I just think he was sitting in the pocket, and I think he was struggling to see coverage. It just wasn't, it looks foreign to him. And I think this year they've gone back to what worked. I think tonight you'll see they'll move him on the launch point. Ball's either out quickly with quick game or get him out on the edges and also taking shots downfield. quick flip Judy Jerry Judy to the 20 Judy being talked about as a guy who if they are going to trade and pick up draft choices and who knows the trading deadline at the end of the month he's one of the guys they're talking about yeah for whatever reason he's had moments that have been good it just hasn't been consistent they need him tonight we look at these receivers with Sutton you have a rookie and Mims Brandon Johnson who scored three touchdowns At some point, you're going to take some vertical shots, and some receivers are going to have to make some big plays. Second and eight. Good, tough running again. McLaughlin came into the game averaging over seven yards a carry. The league average is 4.2. So this is the kid, Youngstown State, undrafted free agent, lighted it up in training camp, and everybody fell in love with him. Yeah, he's 5'7". He's about 185 pounds. but he has really been determined since he showed up day one. They said he would get there at 6 in the morning and wants to see the script. And this is when he wasn't getting any reps. And it just kind of, a guy that just kind of kept hanging around during camp to the point where eventually they said, we've got to give this guy a shot. After one, it's Kansas with a third down and one for Denver. And they give it to the up back and he won't get it. They give it to Burton who picked up a first down when they first had the ball at the beginning of the game. Can't get it here. Fourth down. What a tremendous effort here. Short yardage by Herring. Watch this move right here by 94. You don't hear about him as much, but the quickness off the ball shoots that gap and just explodes. The tight end needs to come down and help out. Burton never had a chance. Riley Dixon is the Denver Hunter. Line drive kick. Fielded. That is kneecaps here by Montrell Washington. And takes it back to the 43. He had the one start as a rookie, but took over the five years, five AFC championship games. Don't have to wait around the velvet ropes to get into that club. Here's Isaiah Pacheco out to the 49-yard line. Mahomes has talked about being patient and not taking chances, not being greedy, not trying to make something happen. Of course, he did that on that second possession. And he's thinking points. His defense has put him in a good spot. They've started at their own 41, their own 43, and their own 43 again here on their third possession. But only the three points so far. Second and five. Sheckle again. And coming in, slanting in from that corner was Patrick Stern-Tan. one of the best in the league third year number one pick out of Alabama while they're still trying to figure out the tackles and that chemistry will come with two new tackles Smith on the left and Taylor on the right the interior is about as good as you're going to find Creed Humphrey the center out of Oklahoma an athlete high school wrestler does a great job with leverage and kind of being the boss up there Trey Smith on the right side both those two instrumental on opening that play up. Pacheco again, darting, dancing, looking. Can't get around the corner. McMillan knocks him down. Kaylee, what you got? Guys, as you were describing Isaiah Pacheco's running style, he told me he wants energy to be his defining characteristic. To the point that two weeks ago, after he got tackled against the Jets, he started doing push-ups. He told me he wanted to show the opponent he's not tired and give the team energy that they can build off of. But to complement that mentality, he's also had to learn some patience. Yeah, there's a guy, another seventh-round draft choice, played at Rutgers. Edwards-Alaire is in the game now, second and 11. Mahomes throws. Once again, that's already for Kelsey tonight as he makes the grab. Here he's caught five on five targets. He has 72 receiving yards. They're moving him more this year than any year in the past. They've moved him, of course, in the past, but I think they're moving him around a little bit more to try to create him, get him off ball and try to create some matchups. They call these Travis routes. This isn't necessarily a design route, like on a route tree. This is just him improvising, and Matt Nagy telling us this week that that's especially on third downs or critical moments in the red zone. We just let him do what he can do, get open. Third down and two. Mahomes spinning around fires and that's incomplete trying to get into the end zone to Sky Moore so it 4 so that Denver defense once again setting up a fourth down Crowd doesn like the fact the field goal unit coming in The pressure comes right here He got Ronnie Perkins one time on that third and five, and he got him offside. But this time he does a good job. Look at Pat, all that work he's doing. Perkins is able to stay with him and zone behind it. Good job by Vance Joseph having the defenders where they need to be. Just nobody open. Chip shot field goal, 25 yards. for Harrison Butker. And now you've got a fake here. And do they pick up the first is the question. Because they run a fake. And it looks like Tommy Townsend, who's the holder, comes up with it. Denver says, it's our ball. Hockley trying to unpile everybody here. I think the winger on the left, Noah Gray, gets behind the center. The runner was short of the line to gain. It's a turnover on downs. First down, Denver. So they run a fake. It doesn't work. Here it is again. Yeah. Noah Gray gets in there to try to get the snap. See the punter pushing. The tush push. Everybody's trying to get him across that line. But Denver's defense, man, ready. Gets another stop. So Noah Gray is a left up back. He's going to actually get under center. And then you see the holder come in. Townsend, he's trying to help out. The backup left tackle, Morris. They're putting as much size as they can. That's equivalent to what you see Philly and all these teams doing with a sneak. I don't know how often they practice that play. They got a little bit of a push, but, you know, we've got to give Denver a lot of credit. Yeah, it looked like they were ready for it, the way they were lined up. Think about those three drives and where they've started. Average about their own 42, and they got three points. Desi Kings coach, you said they've told one of the best in the league, but that time it did not work for his group. So Denver starting deep in their own territory. That's Williams. Kansas City now. Three possessions with the drives ending at the 17 field goal. 15 interception. And the five on downs. So Andy Reid's team picking up a lot of yardage. But only three points so far. Second down and eight. Can Denver get it even going offensively now. Broncos have run 18 plays to 73 yards. Four for play. McLaughlin is the back. Wilson throws a dart. Dangerous, but caught. Greg Dolsitz, who just got activated, making the grab right there. Third down, third and five. Dana does a good job of getting into his face, not letting him get outside. He's trying to force his ball in. I really thought McDuffie came close to jumping that. Russell Wilson just getting it in to tackle over. Bring the left tackle over here. And by doing that, you're going to protect the quarterback. You're worried about Karloftis. But the problem is you only have two receivers, and they are locked down. Nothing that Russell Wilson could do. No one open. All right, two-minute warning. 10-0 Kansas City. You don't need a way in on Kelsey Riley Dixon meanwhile since this punch skyward bounds around Rolls to a stop at about the 18 or 149 And we'll be back as that sign just said in 30 seconds which is an eternity Start from the 19 A little dark. McKinnon makes the catch, stumbles, and down he goes to shine the 25-yard line. Good job by Alex Singleton. You've got to be able to make plays in space against his team. If you don't come up with that tackle, that's easily a first down. He's probably out of bounds. Second and five. Deep downfield. Double coverage and picked off at the 35-yard line. Kareem Jackson flagged down. And Jackson to about midfield. And here comes Hockley to check out the penalty. The initial indication is against Denver. Pass interference. Defense number 27. The ball will be placed at the spot of the foul. Automatic. First down. That's Damari Mathis. And there goes the pick. Mathis just grabs onto the jersey of Sky Moore. Sky Moore will make a move to the post to our right. And once he gets a step on him, the way he catches up, he grabs a jersey, grabs his chest. And that's why the ball is intercepted by Denver. This is a 24-yard penalty. And that's knocked away. That's Mathis right there trying to atone for what he just did. Bats it down second and ten. Pat Sertan's on the other side. Whoever the corner is on the other side is going to be tested a lot. Look at his eyes. Great job. A lot of balls coming his way. Mahomes wants to go after 27 in white. And this time he was ready for it. Good job of jumping that, driving down on the ball. Second and 10. Deep drop. McKenna, he drops it too. to make a third down and 10. So Mahomes so far 14-21 for 156. Of those 156, 109 in the pocket of Kelsey. And I think this is a part of the offense that people are interested in seeing growing. Where they are today versus where they'll be in November, December, January is very different. They're still developing with these receivers. But in a two-minute drill, Kelsey can't make every play. McKinnon can't make every play. You need Tony and Rice and others to step up here. Third and ten. Secondary doing its job. And he has to just throw it away. That's on Jonathan Cooper. Put the pressure on. We've got another flag down. Let's tackle Smith on a hold. They'll decline that. There were two fouls on the play. Bull by the offense. Holding number 79. This penalty is declined. Intentional grounding. Number 15. He was out of the pocket, but the ball did not reach the line of scrimmage. This is a loss of down at that spot. It's fourth down. So it's fourth down. And the penalty is going to move the ball. somewhere inside the 35-yard line. Yeah, he's well outside of the pocket, but he's considerably short of the line of scrimmage. I mean, he's maybe eight yards short of the line of scrimmage, so, again, the right call was made. Frustration there from Mahomes. Just cannot quite find it yet with the rhythm with the receivers. Took only 48 seconds on that drive, of the 61 seconds left. Denver, for what it's worth, has two timeouts. Townsend's pump is a massive booth to the 6-yard line. Caught there, getting around the outside. Mims has got a ton of speed. He gets intercepted at the 42-yard line. Nick Bolton right there, intended for Jerry Judy. And down to the end zone they go. That defense to celebrate. Wilson threw it right to him. And Casey gets it. 3-0 Chiefs. Denver goes with a play action to try to go here. They're trying to affect the backer. But watch how Nick Bolton plays this. He does a really good job of not buying it at all. Keep in mind, he's been out for three weeks. He sees the back going here. Right away, he gets his head on a swivel. is able to look back and recognize there's the route, sinks in coverage, reads the eyes of Russell Wilson, and I think Russell Wilson may have predetermined where to go with that football. Bolton had their 36-yard fumble return in the Super Bowl. Fired wide open, Kelsey. Stiff arming down the sideline. Long gain again, run out by Justin Simmons. It is just astonishing. it's astonishing how open this guy gets when everybody knows he's going to get the pass but now you've got a flag at the end of the play before the pass was thrown holding defense number 27 this penalty is declined the play results in the first down 40 yards now I'm with you they clear out here with Gray he's here he just kind of works himself across the field but with man to man on the right with Mathis there's nobody over there You brought that up to Andy Reid and to Patrick Mahomes this week. Does it ever surprise even you guys that 87 on your ball club always seems to get open? It's crazy. I mean, he's open by 10 yards on so many catches from the 17-yard line. Come back here. Get him back over there. And bring him back here. Tony on a slot back around, and that goes nowhere. Jaquan McMillan right there to make the tackle. Lost on the play of three, second and 13. Yeah, and the edge of this defense has been a problem. It's something that Vance Joseph has really emphasized this week, obviously going up against this quick-hitting offense. They love to get the ball on the perimeter. Russ, of course, hoping that this defense holds up again in the red zone and forces a field goal. Good pocket. That's caught. 15-yard line and wrestled down by the throat. Pacheco wrestled down by Josie Jewell and Alex Singleton. It'll be third down at 8 after a gain of 5. This is a team that has struggled with missed tackles, most in the NFL. And right now, in a short week, a couple series in, Everybody kind of getting their feet under him. Everybody kind of getting the feel for what's coming at them. But they're holding up pretty well. Let's see if they can get pressure on Mahomes here on third down. Jarek McKinnon now in the back of number one. Three receivers set to the right side. Mahomes, pressured, looked out. Gets it away and then just flings it. And it's picked off at the goal line. Justin Simmons. So Denver is able to hold him. You don't want to go down 10-0 to this team. On the road, they keep it at 3-zip, and they get the ball back. Look for a moment. He was under pressure. Look for a moment. I thought he was maybe trying to throw it away. Uh-uh. Simmons comes up with the pick. And with 2.55 to go in the quarter, Denver with the ball. Al, usually this look with two safeties high and a tight end that works down the middle of the field, usually this backer will run with him. He does it. Mahomes locked in. He wanted to get it to Kelsey, but they squeezed him. This is obviously a no-no for anybody. Throws it up. Actually got hit as he released it. Looks like Cooper got to him. Yeah. Ball goes up. Great interception by that Denver defense. And if Rice doesn't make that tackle, he might have taken that all the way back. Absolutely. From the 7-yard line. A little flip here. Four-yard game. McLaughlin. We go to Kaylee. Al, no one has intercepted Patrick Mahomes more than Justin Simmons. That makes four. Simmons told me the key is being in the right place at the right time, consistently, and staying disciplined even when Mahomes breaks the pocket. Last year, after he grabbed his third pick, he told me Mahomes joked with him saying, man, I just love throwing you the football. Simmons said, hey, man, I am not going. Jones in the middle. Does a good job of fighting off of a block here by minors. And then Willie Day is able to clean it up. This defense is playing great football this year. Very physical. A lot of these guys in their second year in Spags' system identify things much quicker, and they're flying around. It's a big third down here for Denver Early. Three Super Bowl rings. In his safe deposit box. Third down and seven. Look out. Wilson gets away. Throws. Caught inside the 40. Troutman. Adam Troutman, the tight end. So, avoids disaster that time. Chased by Mike Dana. And Wilson avoids what would have been the 498th sack of his career. Yeah, and that's just nothing tricky. It's just man on man. He gets in. Bannon gets in there. He's just got to bring him down. Great effort by Russell Wilson. That leg strength to keep that play alive. Fourth and three. Ball of the 38. You've lost 15 straight to this team. You're in last place. He's going for it. Maybe. Timeout. At least he was lining up to go for it. Sean Payton, 15 seasons in New Orleans. Won a Super Bowl in 2009. Of course, he and Drew Brees, a match made in heaven down there. Steps away, winds up in the Fox studio last year. Moves to Southern California. Enjoyed it out there. Yeah. It's pretty cool out here. Enjoyed it. You know, Denver came and opened up the checkbook, and there he is. Yeah. And I think all along when he stepped away and got into TV, talking to him, and at his age still feels that he's in his prime, still has a lot to offer any organization. and Denver was in the need of a coach with that track record. And I think, you know, he's going to do it his way. And he feels that his way is the right way. And it's going to maybe be a process. And it's going to take time. And it's a part of you've got to experience it to really grow. And that's what this team's going through these first five weeks. This will be the ninth play on the drive. Michael Burton lines up next to Wilson. pressure Wilson scrambles away again and he cannot run for the first down and they turn the ball over run out by Justin Reed George Barlapis also chasing him to stymie what would have been a drive extending first down instead Kansas City with the ball when we come back Here go the Chiefs. Their first play is a run by Pacheco. Game of about two. Zach Allen makes the tackle. So Patrick Mahomes. A couple of MVP awards. Two Super Bowl rings against Denver. 11-0. 18 TDs, 8 interceptions. Of course, 15 consecutive wins. So some of those go back to Alex Smith. Go, go. Pacheco again. Had a big day in the Super Bowl. Good, tough running behind Joe Tooney's block. The left guard and a first down for KC. I think that's what's going to be different this year for defenses trying to defend Kansas City. They're still trying to find themselves, the rhythm and the chemistry with the receivers. But Pacheco, I think now in his second year, he kind of exploded onto the scene last year as a seventh rounder. Now you kind of know what to expect from him. And he really gives them a balanced attack. I feel like in the past, the offense was more about the homes in the past game. Retreats, open, and then a little flip back from Kelsey as he sends it to Noah Gray. One tight end to the other. Another first down. I'm having visions, was it Nat Moore and Tony Nathan going way back to the Dolphins against the Chargers. I mean, how calm is Kelsey as he just sits there, which he always does in his zone, and he just waits, waits for his guy. You imagine him practicing that throughout the week. Love to. I mean, he's just out there having fun. He gets to be a quarterback, flip it with his left hand, of all things. Perfect pitch to Noah Gray and a first down for the Chiefs. Vintage. Hook and ladder, hook and trailer, take your pick, first down. from the 36-yard line rolling looks all the way across the field nothing there then throws that's caught inside the 30-yard line and there is his Denver after the Townsend punch down pin inside the five-yard line and forward progress for Williams will take it out to about the two and a half How good are these linebackers? Bolton, Tranquil, Willie Gay, and now Chanel, the young man out of Wisconsin. He can play so many different spots. Good job of recognizing and reading that and then getting into the backfield. Just downhill, anticipating a run. Outnumbered that offensive line. Good job of that backside linebacker flowing. Second and 12. Final minute of the quarter. Wilson rolling, lifting, keeping, and dives for the first down. That's a heck of an effort there. You kidding me? Yeah. I mean, this possession is critical for Sean Payton, and they're backed up deep in their own territory. Looks like he's going to get sacked or have to throw it away. How about the presence of mind by the vet to get the ball out of that right hand into the left hand and then a little stiff arm there on the big linebacker. That's textbook. Perfect. Got away from Bolton. Not easy. Going to run it again. Close to a first. That's going to take us after we get the call on the penalty flag down. Tackled by Bolton. Sean Hockley. There is no foul on the play. It's second down. All right. All right, so it'll be second and very short when we come back as we move on to the fourth quarter. Wind the clock. They will in a second, I promise you. I wouldn't lie to you. You know that. Never lie to you. End of three. Kansas City's sixth. Start the fourth. Second down one for the Broncos. Wilson off play action. Under pressure. Chase. Comes back the other way. Stopped short of the first. Third down. He's trying to change with this drive and the way this game has gone for Denver. They had a decent drive to open things up at nine plays, eights and clock, but ended up on downs. See the interceptions. See the four punts. Sean Payton trying to put a drive together with Russ. Meanwhile, going up against a veteran defensive coordinator. it's got a defense to understand his scheme and playing with a great deal of confidence not just tonight but they have been all year third and one Williams the back bring in an extra lineman who's eligible and he gets the first down so Steve making the tackle there so Sean Payton this is his 16th year coaching 15 for the Saints is its 264th game. Never been shut out. Saying it's not going to happen tonight, right? And you have 44 passing yards. Saying they're swimming upstream. Into a tidal wave. Ruston Spranglin on his drive. Been effective. Under pressure. fires reaching out incomplete it's under such pressure he's rid of it in a hurry and Sutton couldn't hold it in second and ten and you got down there is Justin Reed he'll need attention injury timeout as he begins a lot of Kelsey tonight when he's had chances to just kind of make plays in space and that's it what's one of his great qualities that he brings 24 of his 25 routes against zone, all eight receptions against zone. And again, we talk about being those Travis routes. When he feels leverage, finds a soft spot, he and Patrick Mahomes had such great chemistry, and that's been on display tonight. So second down and 10, scoreboard telling everybody to get louder. and they comply second to ten he sees Bolton walked up here that's why he's adjusting things even looks like Bolton backing out tranquil now at the top's coming everybody's coming knocked down again they do it again another batted pass for the yard line It is 50. Sincleton making the tackle there. 100 or more receiving yards. Single team. You got Kelsey now against the Raiders six times. Against the Broncos six times. Hopkins against the Titans seven times. Soft throw, caught, stays in bounce, close to a first. Sky Moore broke away from Sertan. This is an RPO, which they run a lot of, just kind of a tag, a run play. And if he sees soft coverage, he's going to get the ball out. It's rare to see him go towards Sertan, but with Sertan sinking in coverage and 8 to 10 yards off the ball, He figures with his accuracy he's going to be able to take that pretty quickly, gets the ball out there, and gives Moore a chance to make Sertan miss. And again, another first down. We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good. A little action here. Flip back. Throwing the double coverage intended for McKinnon. No good. Tony was there, so a little razzle-dazzle. It's a no avail. Not quite as designed perfectly. It wasn't quite executed perfectly. The design was fine. I love when we brought up Danny Reed and you said to him, how do you keep just calling these plays? And he said, you know, he kind of winked at us. I may have one for you guys Thursday night. He just hands it off there to Clyde Edwards-Hilaire, whose lineup is a fullback. I thought Kelsey might be, or I thought Mahomes might be going out for a pass there. That may happen sooner than later. that's caught with Shee Rice, and the rookie will set up a first down and goal. McMillan stops him inside the 10-yard line. So twice they've gone to the rookie. He's caught two for 30 yards now. I'm telling you, this is going to be the guy. This is the guy that I think is going to emerge and get better and better because he is very physical. He's got great ability after the catch. We know that about Kadarius Toney, but his fans watch four play more and more. the rookie out of SMU. You're going to see his ability, good shake at the beginning of that route to pull away from McMillan. To see the opening night against Detroit. And if they see Richard, he stopped at the line of scrimmage this time. Benito is right there. No gain on the play for Edwards-Alaire. Second down and goal. Vance Joseph, his defense has done a really good job tonight in the red zone. They've not given up a ton of points to one touchdown that came up with a pick and forced some field goals. One of four so far for Kansas City with touchdowns. Pacheco. Run out, slung out. Pratt wants a flag. Josie Jewell is there. Close. you can see the frustration though too because Jules just slings him out of bounds tall one motion still looked like 8-B in bounds when he initially had contact there and then he just finishes it I think it's a follow through through the ear of the fans but that's just an extension of their run game putting Pacheco out there three receivers in front of him to block went up a little at the end like WWE third down and goal Mahomes against the grain much too long Marquez Valdez scantley first time he's been targeted tonight fourth down so they hold again to no more than a field goal attempt how you gonna love this because your guy got open again Now remember Mahomes is running for his life but watch what he does He says, okay, you got me coming. No problem. I'll just go back here. Look, he's open in the back of the end zone. I just love how he never gives up on a play and always trusts that Mahomes with his creativity is going to eventually find him. And there he is right back there. Looks like Mahomes is looking at him. You're talking about clearly one of the best tight ends in history. I know we've had a whole bunch of them, but boy, this guy, crazy. Butker, backs on three, 9-16 to go, third quarter, 16-0 Chiefs show tonight. And I really think as much as Holmes, Mahomes and Kelsey get the attention, I think the difference as this season goes on is going to potentially be the... ...around the 25-yard line. So that kick is 62 yards of the 19-yard run back, and we return in 13. All right, so can Wilson get something started? Five of eight, 17 yards. The defense lights out. Despite Kelsey having a Pro Bowl first half, they've been able to hold him so often. They do here. They get the ball back. 47 seconds left. The screen here is set up. Nice run here. And then P. Ryan steps out of bounds to stop the clock behind a Lloyd Cushenberry block. Big game there, 15 yards first down at the 39. Sean Payton offense is always known for screens and calling them at the right time here just to kind of get things started with pressure from the Chiefs front. Good job of getting it out to P. Ryan who comes in as that receiving running back. Knocked down. Going to jam it into Sutton. You've got Jalen Watson covering on the play. Second down and ten. We keep talking about the Chiefs trying to build chemistry with what they're doing with Mahomes and growing. I think the same thing could be said with what we're seeing in this offense with Russell Wilson and these receivers. I mean, you need separation. You need some kind of help. It's a good job of Watson coming around and not interfering, but tight coverage. Wilson to the outside having to go down is Cortland Sutton to make the grab there. Clock is still running. They've got two timeouts. And they finally take one here after. Timeout Denver. Wasted a few seconds. 30 second timeout. 27 seconds. Halloween Prime Video. Yep. Trying to make it four out of five. Third and five. Jerry Judy. Two receptions, one yard. Wilson. Sacked. Chris Jones. I was just starting to say, Jones has had a quiet night until now. So it's fourth down. Chris Jones. One of the best. A ton of sacks for a guy who plays inside. Eight straight games now with a sack. I love when he answered a question. about who he lines up on on third down. He said he goes through, looks at the height, the weight, what year they are. He'll move inside. He'll move outside. They just let him do his thing. Spack said on third down, I have no idea where he's going to line up. He just kind of freelances and that time wanted to go up against McClinchy and gets home. How's this for a milestone? Russell Wilson? The 500th time he's been sacked. So Jones provides that milestone. He has the record 11 straight games with the sack a couple of years ago. And now he's got another string going. Now he's got a punt here that they let bounce. And Mahomes has 15 seconds, which is enough or something. Yeah. As long as 87 and red's going out there, they've got a shot to get in field goal range. You bring up a great point about Vance Joseph and his defense. It feels like it's 28-0. It does. I mean, and it's 10. They've been deep in Denver territory most of this night and just the only one touchdown. The kick by the kicking team, number 37, was out of bounds and was the first to touch the ball. This five-yard penalty will be added to the end of the play. It's first down. That moves Mahomes even closer now. It was the rookie, Riley Moss. Clearly out. Even right there, he stepped out on his own. So, 39-yard line. Mahomes. They've got a time out if they needed it. They've got all three. So, they can't stop the clock. Patches made here. 45-yard line. McMillan stops McKinnon. 10 seconds and timeout so you're right I mean you summed it up perfectly this game could be a four score game Denver's defense the offense can't get anything going no and the way it started again if you're a Denver fan you know that there's been a lot of that happening this year with the script everybody makes a big deal out of Sean Payton's scripts and how well they seem to execute we saw it again tonight with that first series took over five and a half minutes on the clock by the way they were running the ball at about six yards It's a clip on that first drive, and since then, they have been shut down completely. They're going up again, by the way, really good defense tonight. Chiefs will get the ball to start the second half. Main man again, Kelsey, who came out with a sprained ankle last week. He was so frustrated. Threw his helmet down. It looked like he'd be gone for a while. Uh-uh. Al, you'll appreciate this. This is his feel. You saw it on the last play in the soft spot in the zone. This time, he kind of feels it, looks and sees that he's going to be taking away the leverage to the inside. So he calmly looks around and walks back to the outside. And the way Mahomes and he are always in sync. Already two catches for him now. Looking for space. Pacheco, enough to pick up a first down. In the pull, lead the way. And then a man who took over for Clyde Edwards-Lair about halfway through last season. Meanwhile, Vance Joseph, that defense, is down at the bottom in almost every category. He's really taking a ton of heat in Denver. Just trying to get something going. The challenge he has is giving up explosives on the ground. You're dealing with Mahomes. Rolling. Oh, knocked down and incomplete. Jaquan McMillan, second-year man out of East Carolina, batting it away. It'll be second and ten. Most people that defend Mahomes, they sit back with two safeties deep, and you want to protect your corners and make them be patient. The problem is when you're struggling to stop the run, dead last in the league and defending the run, you need the safeties to come down and get involved in the run game. And that's the cat and mouse game tonight for Vance Joseph, helping that run game at the same time not hurting yourself against Mahomes. Giving up 36 points per game. He's got 70, killed him. Over the middle, that's caught. taken down at the 18-yard line, Rasheed Rice, rookie out of SMU, second rounder. Mahomes loves to spread it around, and for the five games this year, he has hit 10 or more receivers in the game. I think as the season goes on, Rasheed Rice is going to become a go-to guy, just a rookie still kind of feeling things out, does a great job looking left, out of the corner of his eye starts to peak, because he knows those linebackers followed him to those three receivers, came back and made a perfect throw. As that Michael Jordan tongue-web, two, third, and three. And that's batted at the line of scrimmage. So they set up a fourth down. Mike Purcell batting it down number 98. He's in his eighth season in the league, and Butker will come in to try to make it a 3-0 game. He's a big fella. He can't get to Mahomes. Ball's out quickly. He's trying to get it off to the right to Kadarius. as Tony sits a first down if he's able to get that over top of Purcell. But Purcell in for D.J. Jones makes a nice play there on third down. Jones inactive tonight. So here's Butker against the Broncos. He's missed only one from 51 yards. This one, 35, and it's a windy night, and the wind is swirling. And that kick is good. It's sort of fluttering through. It's going to be that kind of night with every kick tonight. 5.40 to go in the opening quarter. NKC 3-0. Sheets game number 419 regular season and postseason in the history of this building. Opening up in 1972. Right next door to where the Royals have played since about that same time. You think you've called more games here? Pretty a lot. A lot of playoff games over with the boys. Playoff games, yeah. Preseason games, touchback here. They even called a game here, believe it or not, with Hank Stram. The year after he got fired is the Kansas City coach. Wow. Yep. Holy cow. Called a game here, and, of course, the town was going crazy at that point. Paul Wiggin came in to take over. Hank wanted to know if Wiggin had moved his Tiffany lamp in his office. What was the answer? I said yes, he did. He's not happy about it. This is as passionate fan base as you'll find in the NFL. Very. Running back is Javante Williams. There he goes. Big hole. Exploits that baby. And tough running for a gain of 18 yards. Michael Burton, fullback, led the way. But Blanche does a nice job on the right side as well with minors. Watch this double team. They work down, opens up the block for the fullback Burton that you mentioned. And I'm telling you, I don't know if the NFL has really seen what Javante Williams can do when he is healthy. 5'10", good solid 220 pounds. Brings a lot of physicality and more quickness than I think people want to give him credit. Ran for 900 as a rookie, then tore his ACL in the fourth week last year and was done for the season. play action good pocket good again bat one at the line of scrimmage Willie Gay batted it Justin Reed intercepted it and they turned it over 16-0 five and a half to go in the third again by this Kansas City defense And now Mahomes, that deep drop, finds the man underneath. Caught there on the outside by Noah Gray, the number two tight end. Second down. Got to be frustrated because, again, they're putting a drive together. It looked very similar to what the opening drive looked like. Moving the ball, getting into plus territory, and then Spags with a change up there goes to bringing the edge pressure. He's empty. He didn't have a pack. He didn't have a tight end. Only five offensive linemen to take care of him. Just not enough. Second down nine. Four-man rush. Mahomes spinning away. And a valet move. Look out for behind. Get him down. Number zero. Jonathan Cooper. Third-year man. You're on the monitor, Ohio State. One of those seventh-round draft choices. It's amazing. I mean, look at Brock Purdy, of course, would be number one. Yeah. The seventh round. It's amazing. It really is. We do a game every week. Somebody picked in that. I know. I know. That or undrafted free agent. I mean, it is incredible to see. I think we all get excited for the draft. And you watch the first day, the second day. Forget the third day. You end up seeing a lot of guys not to just make rosters, but guys that are major contributors. Third down 11. Mahomes dancing around. Stepping up. He's going to run it. Can he get to the first down? Yes, he can. And out of bounds. A little move toward the end. It looked like he was going out. Stayed in. Jerick McKinnon led the way. And on the third and 11, he picks up 15. He typically seems to save big moments to use his legs as a weapon. They've been doing a good job with safety's back, taking away things for the most part. He's got the underneath throw there to his right, But instead of throwing to McKinnon, he uses him as a blocker on Mathis. He has such good instinct and field vision on those third downs. Twelfth time this year he has scrambled for a first down. Two-yard gain here into Bronco territory. Teams fear his arms so much and his ability to improvise that they're almost forgetting about his legs. But the more you watch him over the years, third down and red zone. He doesn't do it a ton, but he picks his spots to pick up those first downs. Again, Russell just wants to try to get his hands back on the football. Turn this thing around. Even, even, even, even. Go, go. Second and eight. Flip it out here. Pacheco. Close to a first. Spotted a little short. Third down. Let's go, boys. Another one of those nice from the homes. The numbers, good. but we talked about it good on the cold room this week as you look at in the backfield now snap is going to be taken here in the backfield by Tadarius Tony so they changed it up and it doesn't work it was third down and one and they do a little razzle dazzle back of the playbook uh-uh you got Pacheco you got Kelsey back there you got Tony taking the snap but Denver says you ain't going anywhere. Yeah, he predetermined what to do in that zone read. He wanted to keep it so badly that he forgot to read it properly. He hands that ball off. It's a first down, but instead he runs right into Benito, who he's reading. Tommy Townsend to punt. Trying to deaden it inside the five. Does. Perfect. Justin Watson downs it there. A little backspin on it. Denver pinned deep. Minute and a half to go. Third. 16-0. This is Kansas City defense. You know, we can talk all we want about Sean Payton, Russell Wilson, what's going on, why aren't they playing better. They've come into a tough environment. They're going up against a defense that is feeling good about themselves. Many of these guys in their second year. Of course, we know all about what Chris Jones can do, a guy that's been around for a number of years, eight years in fact. But Spags has a group that is playing fast, dialed in, and really playing with tremendous discipline. Russell Wilson hands the ball off here. and then drafted rookie Muggs Wofflin keep in mind I mean I know it feels like a lot more but it's still a two possession game technically see the halftime adjustments first possession they've had here to get things going into the second half a problem spot for them has been the third quarter he told us this week I may script out a few plays here to start the second half I'd go back to that running game the strain worked for him at the end of the first half but they're averaging over six yards a carry run in the football, especially with Javante Williams. P. Ryan is now in the back. Pass down the left sideline adjusting, but it's incomplete. Flag is thrown. Jalen Watson making contact with Court and Sutton. That'll take the ball to midfield. Looks like he grabbed onto that arm. Pass interference. Defense number 35. The ball will be placed with the spot of the foul. Automatic. First down. You lose the football in the air, and it's a back shoulder where the receiver is going to work his way back to the football. And you're lost, you're in no man's land. You're either going to give up the reception or you're going to get pass interference. Move the ball all the way to the 46-yard line. Eight and a half left in the third. McLaughlin. Nothing happening there, Derek. Matty, 91, gets quoted for that tackle. Second to nine. One of the best things that I think this front does is their ability to get off of blocks against the run. Dana gets overlooked, 51, but we talked with Spags this week. That was one of the first things he brought up. You know, we're talking about Jones. Hey, how about the improvement of Karloftis? He said, hey, make sure you talk about 51. This guy's been the unsung hero of this defensive front. Knocked down a couple tonight. A little flip here. McLaughlin. And he gets taken down just shy of the first down. Third on the couple. Justin Reed in on the tackle. That slip screen. Get the ball out. Give him a little bit of space to work with. He's so sudden. Has some power. Surprising power for his size. I love that Sean Payton brought up to him guys that he's worked with in the past. You know, a guy like Darren Sproles. Guys that can be a part of that screen game. Get tough physical yards. It's not just about his speed. Remember, they've been in these third and shorts and not run the football. Javante Williams flanking Wilson. Has it. and Bulls ahead 40-yard line for a first down following Ben Powers picking up as a free agent from Baltimore. When in doubt, just get behind the big left guard who's going to pull around. They've been throwing the football a lot. Nobody's been open on these third and shorts. Good tight coverage. This time they rely on that offensive line. The line, I don't know who thought you would see this coming into the night, but this line is holding their own in this running game. Still early enough in this game, six and a half to go in a two-possession game. You don't want to leave that and abandon the ability to control the line and run the football. Wilson in the pocket. Fires. Judy makes the catch. And that game's 12 on a first down. Jerry Judy pulling it in. So the Broncos on the march right now. Drive started back at their own 25. Vintage on Peyton that they move him around. He motioned from the left, came back to the right. Actually ends up back here in the backfield. And then you get a slip in behind. You get a matchup against the backer. That's a favorable matchup. Picked up the pace here. Go no huddle. Pressure. Hit. In the air. Intercepted. The Chiefs do it. Russell Wilson waiting on the bench. He'll be third down and five now. You know, Sertan gets a lot of recognition because he's such a gifted cover corner. But I think the folks around the league really love his abilities. He's 6'2", 202 pounds because of that play right there. They glitz him, does a great job in run support. Tackles well. Oh, look out. Coming across the line. Who went first here is the question. Ronnie Perkins right over Donovan Smith officials confer neutral zone infraction defense number 51 this 5 yard penalty results in a first down so it's Perkins on what would have been a 3rd and 5 and I think this is all because of Mahomes knowing the situation realizing that a hard count potentially is going to pull somebody off right there Does a good job. And, you know, Ronnie Perkins not playing a lot when he gets in. He's eager. Just jumps there. And Mahomes did a smart play there. Chiefs fifth first down. The fake, the pass. Kadarius Toney came over from the Giants. Sertan is there covering on the play. And that will make it second down and five. Vance Joseph telling us this week that we've got to make game-changing plays. And that's what they did on that last possession. He's been as frustrated as anybody. The media gets upset. The fans get upset. I don't know if anybody's more upset with the way things have gone these first five weeks than Vance Joseph. He's determined to get it right. They're off to a good start tonight. Go, go, go, go, go. Mahomes chased out. Flag thrown. goes deep and just throws that away. Nobody's home. Flag in the offensive backfield. He just saw Sean Hockley to make the call here. Holding. Offense number 74. Ten-yard penalty. Three-play second down. Well, the Denver defense, at least to this point, keeping them very much in the game. Yeah, and think about it. I mean, all three of these possessions close to midfield, and up to this point they put a plan together. You look at these two teams on paper, even you and I were looking at it, it's like, well, Denver's going to have their hands full against Mahomes, but they show up in a short week with a good plan. He kind of streamlined the plan, and they're playing a lot faster. Not easy either. I mean, you lose a game on Sunday, and you've got Monday and Tuesday at home, and you fly on Wednesday, and you're playing the world champs on Thursday. Nice hold here And that's Clyde Edwards-Alaire A couple of years ago he looked like he would be Their ace running back for a long time That lasted as long As it took for Isaiah Pacheco To get into the backfield Yeah I think even going into last year I think a lot of people thought he was the guy But once Pacheco showed what he could do I loved it, what did Mahomes tell us He said he runs like He's angry at the ground That's how physical and how tough he runs. I've heard him running angry, but not angry at the ground. First time I heard it, it was a great description. Third and eight. Mahomes stepping up. Look out from behind. Hit as he throws. Caught. First down. Who else? 87. Kelsey. So Mahomes gets in trouble. He's chased by Benito. He almost got it from behind. Instead, the next thing you know, they're on the march again. 30-yard line. Now, these guys are as good as there is at running routes, and then once the route is taken away, especially on third down, watch the recognition that his quarterback's in trouble, and then he looks around and just finds a soft spot. I mean, how many times have we seen it? It's one thing to draw the play out, but Mahomes and Kelsey deserve so much credit for those off-schedule plays. Flip out here. Check out. And finally wrestling down. First guy to get there was Ronnie Perkins. Got away there. Turns what would have been a six or seven yard gain into a nine yard gain. The other thing about Kelsey is when he does the adjustments, it just looks so routine. You know, there's no panic. There's no, where am I looking? It's just, honestly, I always say it almost looks like he's just out at a practice field. and him and Mahomes were out there in July just working on some routes. Meanwhile, out here against the Broncos on a Thursday night. Pirouetting at 6'5", 250. Big hole again to the 14-yard line. That's Pacheco. Caught. And the ball is out. And Kansas City has it. Trenton McGruffy knocked it out. Gay takes it to the end zone for the celebration. Samaji Pirine ending Denver's very faint hopes. This defense is going to be doing this to a lot of teams this year. This back end is flying to the football. It's not just about coverage. It's about how they rallied the ball. Another example of that from McDuffie. Again, second-year player out of Washington. Great play out in space. brings bad intentions with him. Ball comes out. And because of the way they run to the ball, Willie Gay right there to jump on it. Well, they can run it out right now. An 11-point difference, which is a very significant number to a few of our friends. A few indeed Since games don end with a 10 difference and you know what I talking about Here we are next week Jaguars At least any of our friends are wondering about what going on here You've got Lawrence. You've got Carr. You've got New Orleans. Both teams. Winding records right now. Three and two. With games coming up for each on Sunday. Here's a little food for thought. Yes, sir. Chiefs next three. Chargers. Yep. At Denver. Right. Miami. And think about this, how big that is against Miami. They have the Bills coming up later in week 14. Home field advantage for Kansas City is always big. But a big difference between going to Buffalo or needing to go to Miami and playing right here in Arrowhead. Word just came down to me that Taylor Swift has written a couple of songs for us tonight. Touchdown Romance, a pigskin love story. And Thursday Night Lights with a couple of lightweights. I like that one. I like that one. Yeah, we cover the world here. Kansas City winning its last 16 regular season games against the Denver Broncos, who head back to the Rockies. Gave it a battle. Made it a battle. Defense allowed only one TD to Kansas City. That doesn't happen very often. Sean Payton still has not been shut out in 16 seasons. two veteran coaches exchanging pleasantries Kelsey of course a great night with nine catches to 124 80 and 20 is his lifetime record Mahomes in his first 100 games counting postseason see you in a couple weeks hang around post game show the JCPenney post game show coming up right after these messages. Talked about it a couple of times tonight. That's four. Well, they're slant moving. Drop here. Shoot this way with Jones, who's so quick off the ball. And again, that emphasis against the shorter Russell Wilson. Just get your arms up and knock those balls down. Those quick throws. third and ten this is going deep and off the fingertips that time of Brandon Johnson Jalen Watson covering on the plate Brandon Johnson first time they've thrown his way to another guy who has three touchdown receptions this season just a go route here trying to get a little separation there at the line of scrimmage tight coverage by Watson and the best thing, well that is textbook the best thing he does here is read the eyes and anticipates the ball, gets his head turned around to locate it and knock it away. Riley Dixon. 22. Washington holds it in. Flag is thrown. He's got room. It's a good run back. And, of course, everything is pending the infraction. That was a 51-yard boot, a 25-yard run back, but... Holding by the kicking team, number 44. This 10-yard penalty will be added to the end of the play. It's Kansas City's ball. First down. How unusual it was to have the receiving team call for the penalty. And then Sean Hockley says, no, I meant it was the... It was the receiving team, not the kicking team. So instead of the ball being in midfield, when we left you for the break at the end of the last segment, the ball has moved back. You know what I'm talking about. Here we got you. We got you. Thank you. I was with you. I've not seen that call very often. I don't think Terry has either. Meanwhile, I've got my promo cards flying around here in the wind, but apart from that. There we go. Second and seven. Screen. Pacheco. First down. Nice tackle made there by Singleton. We can tell you Amazon Music Live back midnight Eastern time with Metro Boomin. And our man hosted by two teams. Tune in right here on Prime Video. When the game ends, live music begins. Metro Boomin, ladies and gentlemen. I fly out. You stick around for that show, don't you? Damn right. Ball's at the 24. Pacheco. The boys the first guy, but not the second. And Ronnie Perkins was there to slow him down. Tackle made. Back of the line, it'll be second down and 11. I know it's been a long night for Russ Wilson and Sean Payton, But this defense, you're playing the defending Super Bowl champs. You've held them one of five in the red zone. You've created a turnover. You've done about everything you can to keep your team in this football game to give them a shot. And it's not been a great year for this defense. They're 32nd almost every step. But tonight, they've stepped up. Someone's going to have to make a play one more time on this side of the ball. Even, even, even, even. Go, go. What do we do? Second and 11. Going deep. off the fingertips that time of Justin Watson. In front of Mathis, could not hold in, and he's hurt. Time out for injury. Runs a great route. A little out and up against Mathis, who they've been picking on and trying to go after. He does a really good job of pulling away from him. The ball is perfectly thrown. And he's just unable to come down with the ball. That's a huge gain. and then all his weight comes down on that right. It looks like that right arm. So they work on him. He's still down an hour after the injury timeout. Here's McKinnon, and McKinnon able to slide through, picked up the first, still on a move. Flag is thrown, and McKinnon for the moment is going to take it to the 10-yard line. Sertan is able to run him down because of flag all the way back. I think Valtese scantling a push in the back. This is going to come all the way back right around the 32-yard line. So forget about all that. It was a third and 11. They've been hitting some screens. That one hit here. Close. That being a late hit. there out of bounds by Reed but a no call the fullback Burton Williams the running back Williams runs into the waiting arms of one Chris Jones the big fella hands he has great length we always get excited to watch where's he gonna bounce around he's a pass rusher but How quick is he? He's a defensive tackle at 6'6", and he's able to olay guards to try to come out at him. So it's not just always that burst off the line. Listen to him as a veteran talking about hand placement and reading guards and how much pressure they have on their hand. Wilson to the outside. To the 22-yard line goes McLaughlin. Jones is also a bit of a gourmet, as we know, right? Yeah. I mean, we met him a few years ago, and a gourmet meal for him was like his mother cluckers. He got rid of that. Now, you know, he's telling us about, you know, quong rong. First thing you want to know is where's the best steakhouse. Of course. He's got a high bar. You know, he does. That place is okay. Last time I went, it wasn't the best. Very articulate with his. A regular Zagats guide. Yep, third down and five. Everybody coming. Jailbreak. Pass thrown, a little underthrown. Judy is there. Covering on the play is McDuffie. Flag is down. Mike Edwards came in from the safety spot to put the heat on. They sent everybody on that one. And I think that's what it was, the follow through. Roughing the passer. Defense number 21. Generally in fact, this is the goal. It's first down. It was Edwards. They brought Bolton. And, again, they get pretty exotic right here. He's able to shoot through the gap. And, again, I'd love to bring Terry in here. It's not to hit, but is it to follow through there, Terry? Is that the call? It looks like towards the end he might land with all his body weight on the quarterback. It's right on the edge, and they're generally going to call that when he does do something like that. He needs to brace himself or get to the side. Yeah, you saw Andy. That was the right on the edge response to it. P. Ryan is the back. Can't get a first down without a touchdown from the 11. Wilson. Sutton in the corner of the end zone. Portland Sutton looking around. Saying, hey, wait a second. I'm in. Now it's going to come down to his left foot, or his right foot, the near foot. Watch his right foot and see if he has possession. Right foot down. He still has possession. Left foot down. Does he bobble the ball? Man, it looks like he possessed that, Terry. That looks like a touchdown to me. Terry, weigh in. It is. Actually, it's the knee that comes down. He gets control right there, and then the knee comes down inbounds, and he maintains control through contact with the ground. This is a touchdown. Well, you've got to have a challenge here, obviously, so the flag is out. Denver is challenging the ruling on the field of an incomplete pass. Some play. Well, well, well. Let's see what happens when we come back. A two-point conversion would make it a one-possession game if the touchdown stands. This is the way we saw it. I mean, it was called incomplete. We could tell before we went to the break, it was a touchdown. Yeah, as Terry mentioned with the knee, and the big thing is the ball was not, he was not juggling the football. He had clear possession of it when he's knee touchdown. It's clearly a two-point try here. He's trying to make it an eight-point game. From the two. Give it to William. And he goes for the conversion. So it's 6-0-7. Kansas City, so many opportunities inside the 20, but the Denver defense is able to hold them except one time. And all of a sudden, it's 16-8. Yeah, they got a chance. Great block right here working on this double team. And you get a block here. It just opens up very, very nicely here. Good job by the center. Cushenberry, they're able to climb up to the backer, Willie Gay. And you always think about what kind of pass play will you come up with. But the way they have been able to control things, for the most part, up front, this run game has been something that they can rely on. And that time, with a lot on the line to make this a one-possession game, they're able to get a good push. I mean, they run the ball 20. Pacheco, nice tackle. Coming up, Simmons stopping him there. Timeout taken by Denver, 258. It's great to see Justin Simmons back in his lineup. He missed a couple weeks, was back last week, and this is what he's really known for. His range in the pass game, and then with the experience that he has, how quickly he's able to recognize things and get involved and run support. Eighth year out of Boston College, takes away that space and all that speed and potential of a big play with Pacheco. No chance there to get that play started. Second down and 11. The city, all they need is a field goal. They're thinking about eating up clock and trying to make this a two possession game Little flip here Tony he gets dumped at the 24 and They've got the two-minute warning. They've got one time out. They're going to save that right here. And, of course, Kansas City will let that clock run down as close as they can to about 215. There's Butker. He's already kicked a 60-yarder tonight. Of course. Mahomes gets sacked back at the 36-yard line. Zach Allen came crashing through. So it's fourth down. Makes it a easy field goal. Slightly more problematic. And we'll see what happens on the other side of the two-minute warning, which is taken right here. it'll be fourth down and 22 field goal units coming in at the two minutes own 42 yard line and one timeout with two minutes. Butker bangs that one dead down the middle What a weapon. Yeah. I mean in a game like this it hasn't been your prettiest. Right. One possession late in the game You need points. Mahomes with a rare mistake taking that sack to push it all the way back to 52. But Mr. Automatic puts it right through the middle. So four field goals tonight, 35-60, 25-52 yards. You know, the Denver defense, I mean, nobody's been taking more heat, I think, than Vance Joseph. I mean, to come in here and allow one touchdown and make four field goals, two, a significant difference. And keep them in the game. Yeah. I mean, the red zone alone is where they were able to keep them in the game. One touchdown out of five attempts. Gave up some yards, but they squeezed when they had to. And I think for Denver fans, again, they're frustrated. They want a winning team, and we all understand that. But you're building this thing from the ground up. It's been a long time since, well, back to 2016, since they had a winning season, 2015, and got all over to the Super Bowl. Right. But I think it shows you what Joseph and his defense is capable of doing. They haven't even been to the playoffs since then. To the 25 it comes. Well, this is how they ended up getting the pressure. You see how they walk so many defenders up. There's seven guys up close. A couple of them show, and then they mug and then drop, and it confused the offensive line. So Joseph dials it up there at the right time to free up Zach Allen. And look at him. I know he played in Arizona with J.J. Watt. He kind of looks like him there in his uni. So Denver has one timeout from the 25. 5. Wilson over the middle, and that's broken up at the very last minute. Right at midfield. Mike Edwards was there. Trout with the tight end. Couldn't hang on second down at 10. Spacks came out this week and talked with the media about how much he's appreciated. This guy came over first year from Tampa, and he's got versatility. Doesn't give up on that play. The ball's well thrown, but he doesn't see the ball. But now he does. He's able to fight through that, his arms, to dislodge the football. Great play. Second and ten. Three-man rush. A floater three times for 115. That's five yards per carry. Here's the roughing the passer. This is the big call. And I think what Terry said is right. I think all his weight coming down on the quarterback. ended up making the call, giving Denver that much more of an opportunity than Sutton with that great catch to get on the board. Penalty was on Edwards. Mahomes goes to work from the 25. And Prime Video's most watched documentary of all time in the U.S., Kelsey now streaming on Prime Video. Follow Jason, Travis, and the Kelsey family through the most epic year of their lives, culminating in a Super Bowl showdown for the ages. Great game. Won by Kansas City over Philadelphia. Well, and of course, looking on is his, at the moment, his good buddy and girlfriend. Taylor Swift, he makes the catch here. She's a game to three. That makes single care. Well, Kelsey now is still down. and will hobble back to the sideline against, again, that ankle was injured. It's not a high ankle. They call it the regular low ankle sprain, but he's going to come hobbling off here at least for one play. And that's the thing with ankles. You know, he's just trying to push off. Singleton's going to wrap up around that ankle, you know, and it's plays like this with the scar tissue that it just sets you back, you know, just always lingering. Second and seven. Blitz. Gets away as he normally does. Fakes a throw. He's bumped out of bounds. Pass Jonathan Cooper on the helmet. Third and a deuce. Third and two. I love when the quarterback's four yards downfield and does the pump fake. Defense will fall for it. See if Kelsey comes. Yeah, he's going to come back out on the field here. So good to see that he's feeling all right. And good for Kansas City considering it's third down. Nine times out of ten, you're looking to get him the ball. He's off to the right of Mahomes. Mahomes is thrown to him nine times, completed every one of them. For 124, third and two. Throws, caught. But she writes to the 40-yard line. Kareem Jackson is there saving the TD. 28 yards. Watch him affect Singleton here using his eyes to move him towards Kelsey. Been going to Kelsey a lot, and he moves 49, and it opens up a nice passing lane to get the ball back to Rice. Got the eyes going. He's got the tongue going, the whole thing. Love the way he surveys. On, on, on, on, on. The blue and set. Inside get Pacheco. Threads his way to the 35-yard line. Second and six, chewing up a little bit of time here as well. Each team has all of its timeouts. Pacheco out and can't get his helmet situated right so Clyde Edwards Allaire comes in still plenty of time play clock at 8 seconds and 6 Holmes throws Caught. 24-yard line. Tackle made there. Stymor making the grab. Mathis makes the stop. First down. Take a look at our next-gen stats powered by AWS with Mahomes throwing the football 10 yards or more in the air, 4-7. For 87 yards, under 10, obviously a lot of them tonight against the style of defense. Had to go underneath, and that's really been a theme for him the last couple years. 30 seconds I'm out. You need to be patient, but this Denver defense has proven to be a handful for Kansas City, especially finishing off drives. They're moving the ball. They just can't put it in the end zone. Denver takes the timeout to stop that clock, 3-0-4. They have two plus the two-minute warning. Kansas City clearly in field goal range right now. Mahomes is now thrown for 305 yards. We started to say before, with Mahomes, unless he has a perfect passer rating, Everybody says, well, he was okay. So, you know, it's anything but perfect tonight. But here it is. And a battle tonight. 29-39, 3-0-5. Run the ball three times to 33 yards as well. First down. Big. They don't have to come back. Here's the push in the back. McMillan's just trying to get to the football, and there's the block right there. Ruling on the field is that the runner stepped out of bounds at the 35-yard line. During the play, personal foul, blindside block, offense number 29. The penalty will be half the distance to the goal. It's first down. Correction, the 15-yard penalty. After all that, he steps out of bounds on top of it. Correction, the blindside block was number 11. Yeah. In third down. Yeah. We've had a few corrections already. So that was the blind side block there. We talked about that. On top of it, he steps out of bounds. Right there. So the rest of it all for naught. Get a whole bunch of nothing, and next thing you know, he had a third and 26. I love the way the crowd boos. You can see it on the big screen here. Can do no wrong. Give you the home team. 37 third and 17 not 26 now I got a little past it's low but scooped up and then a little short of the first down where she writes the rookie was scored before at least in the 23 yard reception before got into the end zone opening day crowd doesn't want that's still going but yeah it's fourth down but he doesn't pick up the first down but you get a glimpse of what Rice can do after the catch. I mean the acceleration I thought maybe Pacheco was lined up there. He was moving so quickly so again giving Chiefs fans a glimpse of what is to come later in the year for this rookie. Tommy Townsend wobbly kick short fielded here Mims takes it to the 40-yard line. Everybody's going to look at Russell Wilson. They're going to talk about, man, what's going on, why we're putting up some big yards through the air. But if you really watch the film, you'll see it's been tight coverage with Snead and company downfield. Trent McDuffie doing a good job. Spax puts these guys on islands. Ask them to hold up. Joshua Williams has held up when he's had his chances in his second year. Jalen Watson. So a great job on the back end. And then again, I think that's really the difference in this defense. Williams in his second year. Watson in his second. Cook, the safety six. Reed in his second year in the system coming over from Houston last year. McDuffie in his second year. First rounder out of Washington. So all these guys really locked in and following their instincts, not thinking about scheme anymore. And Wilson's been limited to 57 yards on 17 attempts tonight. Going deep. finally is able to connect on a deep throw to Cortland Sutton. So he had 57 yards before that and picks up 23 there. Yeah, you had two defenders in the left flat. There's the corner, Williams. You also have a linebacker, Gay, that ends up sinking it. Two guys in the background up on tight underneath coverage. It's one of the few mistakes we've seen from Kansas City. So it opened up an easy throwing window over the top of that coverage to Sutton. Williams for six. 8.40 left in the fourth. It's nice to see Russell Wilson stretch this defense and finally have an open receiver. I really thought coming into tonight, the way Russell Wilson's been playing in this Sean Payton offense, his greatest strength his whole career is that vertical shot, Those go balls outside of the numbers. And Kansas City is completely taking that away tonight. Second down five. Chased by Jones Wilson. Out of bounds. Takes a shot at the very end from Justin Reed. But legal. First down. Great job again. He looks like he has a chance of Chris Jones, who's going to come in and get right into his face right there. Then he's just able to shake him. Then eyes downfield. See Chanel follows the running back, Williams downfield. So, again, this is what he's done a lot of this year.
