 The Jets beginning their drive from the 31-yard line. Brees tall on the ground. Brees tall with a nice run. Brees tall for a gain of eight. So Rodgers tonight is 0 for 4 in his illustrious career, which is now in his 20th season. Ties the longest streak to start a game. He's never gone 0 for 5 to start a game. Well, it's an offense that, as we know, has potential based on the pieces that they have. it's just been very inconsistent you know and that's the thing that's been I think driving Aaron Rodgers and everybody crazy they put Braylon Allen in the back two back set here meanwhile off to the races goes Brees Hall around the left end gives the crowd something to cheer about gain a 16 for him yeah the old pen and pull you got the tight end right here who's able to seal it and the tackle on the left side Smith's able to get around also 17 Adams was able to help out now you're able to hit an alley and get Brees Hall out there where he can do some damage he is a great receiver out of the backfield we know that, we talked about that earlier but when he squares those shoulders up he is a very talented back and really good to get him room to work Todd Downing took over as the play caller from Nathaniel Hackett, meanwhile his first completion is for a loss So Aaron finally gets off the completion schneid. But Brees Hall loses two, second and 12. Toto, who missed last week, just eyed that the entire time. The Jets tried to sell it. Aaron Rodgers tried to sell it, looking off to his right. Look at his offensive line. I think they may have tipped their hand a little early. They'll watch 39. He's waits, waits. That's a screen. Right away, he's out there to beat Brees Hall. No chance that play had at all of it being able to develop because of that instincts there by 39. Adams moving. Rodgers goes to him, but he is covered immediately and taken down by Kamari Lassiter, the rookie out of Georgia. To Kaylee. Guys, when Will Anderson came off the field looking like he'd had contact to his left shin area, you saw him putting very little weight on that left leg. He spent eight minutes in the blue medical tent. Then you guys saw him, just as I did, come out, do some agility drills and position drills to test it out. He looks to have a very heavy tape job on his left ankle, and he's been given his helmet back by the training staff. He's back in the game on a third down and seven. Braylon Allen is now in the backfield. Got seven guys walked up. Nearly jumped off. Passes behind Wilson, but he's able to reach back. Make the catch and pick up the first down. Eric Murray covering on the play. So Garrett Wilson reaching back, saving it, picks up the first. And that's a great shot by Aaron Rodgers there, just feeling it. Saw the seven that are uptight. Look at Stingley losing ground. So he knew right away, even though the ball was behind Wilson just a little bit, it's just his recognition of where the soft spot was versus that pressure. He gets it out in a hurry, and Wilson makes a great play on the football. His 50-second reception leads the team. Cole, nowhere to roam. Second down. And it might take us to the end of the quarter. But you never know with Aaron. It's just nice to see them running the football. You know, this is an offense. It's been one-dimensional. They've been more about running. We've got a late flag that just came in. Sean Hockett I think the crowd wants a face mask after looking at the replay Personal follow face mask Defense number 91 The 15-yard penalty and an automatic first down Fully with that penalty And a Marcham Where was that last? Last week in our game with Minnesota and L.A., that was a late flag. I don't know if replay helped on that or not, but that play was over. Yeah. And then the flag came in. Right call. You'd love to see the right call being made. Mm-hmm. The crowd saw it, and the flag came out. Not that that made the difference. I think the officials were talking about it. Meanwhile, the clock starts. It runs down. Rogers trying to get them to jump. We're kind of muted, though, tonight. Not, you know. Yeah. Very different from when we were here week three. Absolutely. Five straight losses will do that. Get a little toss back here. Corley. Plenty of room all the way to the end zone. And we'll get after these guys. A mental mistake by Malachi Corley on the goal line. Costly. How is that addressed at halftime? Yes, it's unacceptable, and he knows that. He'll learn from that and grow from that. And I've got a feeling he's going to make up for it. All right, thank you. All right, thank you, Kaylee. So there he was. He dropped it before he went into the end zone, resulted in a touchback, and seven points went away. Start with a three-spall up to the 35. He goes to get a five-second down and five. I think his answer there to Kaylee's question gives you an idea of why Aaron Rodgers and a lot of these Jets players in a very awkward, weird situation where you lose your head coach early in the year. They've said, hey, he's been a rock. You know, we like him. He's a former player, and, you know, he's done the best that he can under these circumstances. But even that answer, hey, he's going to make up for it here in the second half, just trying to spin this thing and continue to try to find positivity, which is tough to do. ball again. Coming up close to a first down here. In the market just shy. Third down inches. Interesting to see what Todd Downing and the offensive staff comes up with to try to obviously get this offense going. Get Aaron Rodgers being able to run the ball up front and he got to win downfield. Toss here. Allen up to the 43. So Braylon Allen got him to a good start this year. Seldenly used, though, in the last couple of games. Rookie had a Wisconsin fourth-round pick. Yeah, really a good effort there. That looked like it was not going anywhere, and he's able to get that defense, a fast-flowing defense, to go out on the edge and saw that there was a crease to the backside. He was able to cut it back and get some positive yards. So they're on the ground here to start things off. Now they go trips off to the bottom. Allen. They had a nice little one-two punch going earlier in the season, but it's been Paul who's taken over most of the duties of late. But Allen with a nice game here, second down. And he is a handful. As I look at Braylon, Allen, we talked about it when we were here week three. I watched him play quite a bit when he was at Wisconsin. He was a three-year starter there for the Badgers, and they built their offense around his physicality and his ability to run the football. So, as you say, Allen, nice tandem, very different style of backs with he and Hall. 20 years old, he's the youngest player in the NFL right now, Second down and five. Quick toss here. Nice move. To the outside goes Wilson. And then Peacley slings him out of bounds. No flag on the play after that. Gain of eight. First down. So they run it four straight times. This is another run. But if he sees that he's got a quick throw out there, you've got the blocker out in front, you take it. and an easy job to be able to pick up first down yardage. How many times have you seen number eight do that when he sees soft corner? Has that tag on that run, be able to just flip it out there for first down yards. Back-to-back first downs. They have only seven in the game. Extra man comes. Rodgers moving. Rodgers hit from behind. That's Neville Udit who made contact with him. Aaron Pass, second down, and ten. Aaron Rodgers early in the year was moving around pretty well, coming off that Achilles, and then he's gotten some hits on him. He's not moved around as much. That's scary any time, let alone when you're coming off an Achilles injury that he had a year ago. Oh, for sure. Brace himself. Ball at the 45. play fake, pass, Adams and Adams shoves his way for a first down so back to back to back, first downs to the Jets to start the second half, Bullock makes the tackle it's a great job again by Aaron Rodgers, sensing and feeling he's got a run play here to Allen if he wants it but he sees this blitz, see that right there Petrie? flips it out there because the safety is so deep so the rookie Bullock was back sees this blitz and says, hey, we're not going to run this. Look at that. Flip it out to Adams. Got it blocked by Wilson. Second time he's done that. So a really good combination of running the football. 935 times in the career that started in 2009. That's his longest ever. Meanwhile, you got Nixon giving them some room, taking it out to the seven-yard line. Second down and five. Yeah, you're right. That's the play of the game. By far. By far. Kendrick Green now in it. Left guard for Kenyon. Green. Remember, they've already had a problem. This is the third left guard because Patterson who came in for him last week is down this week. So Kendrick Green, 53, gets his opportunity here. Welcome to the game. That's 95. Quinnen Williams right across from you. Good luck. Godspeed. Second and five. Mixon. Nice move again. First down. Kaylee, you got something good for us? Not really, guys. An injury report for you here. Sorry about that. It's how it goes. So with Kendrick Green in the game, that's because Kenyon Green is in the x-ray room right now. We're told he has questionable return because of a shoulder injury. We saw C.J. Stroud fall on it when he came up hurting. And then for the Jets defense, cornerback D.J. Reid is questionable return. He is being evaluated with the independent neurologist for a concussion, as well as defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, questionable because of a need. Meanwhile, Brandon Echols comes in in Reed's spot. Mixing carries for a couple here. A little over ten minutes to play in the half. Still no score. Echols, who in college at Kentucky played corner, but in the NFL he's been playing nickel behind Michael Carter. When Carter's been down, he's had chances to play. There's Will Anderson. Echols, by the way, has the only two interceptions the entire year. This Jets defense has two picks. He has them both. Think about that. This is an aggressive defensive unit, typically up near the top in a league. None for Gardner. None for Reed. Eight games into the season, too. Huge hole. And Mixon's done all of the work on this drive and has taken them from the two-yard line after the 26th first down. The backers walk up and show pressure, and then once they start to bail, both these guys, they start to bail, and it makes it easy for them to be able to, the guard in the center, to be able to get up to those backers. That play just opened up. The interior, again, is where the Texans want to work tonight. With C.J. Mosley down, Sherwood's a great player, but you lose the experience, you lose the knowledge, and the safety is Davis and Adams. Mixon gets a rest off the play fake. Catch is made, trying to stay inbounds. And that's Schultz. Nice move there. Turns nothing into something, breaking away that time. And making a gain of seven, second and three. Sauce Gardner is such a great player. But an area that he's got to get better in, an area that he's been getting criticized a lot is tackling. Boom, right there, wrap him up. I mean, Schultz is a good player, but you've got Quincy Williams and Sauce Gardner. And you've got poor tackling. and Sherwood also misses him, usually a sure tackler. That looked like it was going to be a loss of three or four, but instead he picks up seven yards. Yeah, that's been the issue. Gotten a lot of pub lately about that second down and three from the 33-yard line. Mixon is back. Is he ever? What a night he is having to this point. So Mixon is now carried with a flag down. So for the moment that was his... By the offense, number two. Robert Woods, the veteran against Jalen Mills. I apologized earlier. I was calling him Chuck Clark, who was obviously on the IR. Mills, who's in there playing. We just talked about Adams and Davis being out, Isaiah Oliver, and Mills who had to step up. Woods, that's what he's known for, just a guy that's a great receiver, but I think within the league people really appreciate how physical he can be. That time, you can see, wraps up around the shoulders of Mills, makes it an easy call for the officials. So five penalties now on the Texans. That negates what would have been a 15-yard gain. Stroud is under pressure again. Blushed out. Fires deep down field. And is the catch made? It is at the 45-yard line by Robert Woods. He's made a few of those in his 12-year career out of USC for a game of 32. So Stroud extends the play, puts it right down the chalk and woods. Does he stay in bounds? That right foot, did he toe tap it? The Texans are going to go hurry here to try to see if they can get the ball snapped before the red flag comes out. No challenge. Stroud on. So that's a brouhaha here in this area. Everybody's flipped off about something, and this is his time in the sun. Rodney Patterson to kick off. Steven Sims to run it back, and Sims with a good run back with a flag thrown. Sean Hockley is a nice referee. We'll hear from him immediately. Right out of the gate. During the return, holding by the receiving team, number 56. Ten-yard penalty. It goes down. So C.J. Stroud played his college football, of course, at Ohio State. For Herbstreets' alma mater. Number two overall pick behind Bryce Young last year. Young went to the Carolina Panthers. And Stroud meanwhile had a tremendous season. He was the offensive rookie of the year. His numbers are great. His touchdown to interception ratio last year great. This year very good. and he starts this drive from his own 16-yard line. Jets bring pressure. Line does a good job, and the pass is broken up. Stover, the intended receiver. He's the tight end, the backup tight end, D.J. Reid, breaking it up. It'll be second down and 10. Interesting to see how Bobby Slowick, the offensive coordinator, attacks tonight against the Jets with a very aggressive defense. Keep in mind, we talked earlier about their two top receivers, Stephon Diggs now out for the year with the ACL. Nico Collins hopefully back maybe in another week. By the way, those, as a duo, they lead the entire NFL over 1,000 yards receiving. So how will they be able to overcome those losses tonight? So Tank, Dell, and Robert Woods are the wideouts here. A little hesitation there, and the handoff in the backfield goes to Mixer. We've got another flag on the play. So already two penalties in the first nine seconds. It looks like Quentin Williams just trying to get a quick jump there on that snap count. The Jets are the most penalized team in the NFL. Part of the reason that they've been so inconsistent. Offside. By the defensive nose tackle. Five-yard penalty at second down. The number was 95. Yeah, there it is with Williams. and that'll make a second down and five now out at the 21. So Jeff Ulbricht took over three games ago. He is 0-3 after Robert Sala was 2-3 and was fired after that trip to London. Ulbricht had been the defensive coordinator and he is still calling the defensive signals. So doing double duty as the head coach is Straub. Pump fake throws to the outside and that is incomplete. Robert Woods, the intended receiver. Jalen Mills covering. It'll be third down and five for the Texans. I think this defense has been challenged, whether it's effort or miss assignments or hustling or tackling or whatever it is. Here's an opportunity here on this first series of third down to try to get Stroud and company off the field. And remember, without Collins and Diggs, you've got the tight ends. You've got Mechie, Hutchison, Dell. see if somebody can separate from this man coverage give him an option three receivers set on the left side looks that way, throws, finds the open man that's Tank Dell making the cash, Tank Dell is 5'10", 165 nicknamed by his mother said he was a little tank when he was growing up that's how he got the nickname, 16 yards they show man coverage and then they fall back to zone And C.J. Stroud, great job with his vision. Not fooled at all by the post-snap movement. Trust these receivers. He was telling me on the field before the game, yeah, he hates to lose his guys, but has a lot of confidence in Tank. Xavier Hutchison and Mechie stepping up tonight. And even Robert Woods, the veteran, will get an opportunity. Off the fake, running around. Mobility. Keeps his eyes downfield, fires deep downfield, and nobody is home. It'll be second down and ten. Speaking of the wide receivers, you mentioned Nico Collins. Nico Collins was actually leading the league in receiving yards when he went out with an injury, but he is back in their next game. Yeah, it's great to see him get his opportunity to get back. If you've not followed the Texans a lot this year, one of the things that's most concerning is C.J. Stroud. He has been pressured as much as any quarterback in the league. left side Kenyon Green has had his issues there and scrubs the center so he's gonna have to get the ball out quickly tonight they got to get their running game going Mixon all passes so far that is caught short of the first down is Dalton Schultz tackle there by Quincy Williams so they've started the game with five consecutive passes and it will be third down and four Eventually we're going to see a lot of Joe Mixon tonight Who has really done the job as Aaron Rodgers waits his turn on the Jets' sideline Mixon came over from Cincinnati and has been great There of course is Devante Adams who came over two weeks ago Ready for their first opportunity Stroud has other ideas to keep it going here on a third down and four Pass number six in a row avoids the sack, gets away from the moment and throws under pressure and incomplete Hassan Redick who held out, got him in a trade with Philadelphia, but he said no, no, I want a new contract held out for the first seven games, here he is Texas tried to move the launch point, get him away from the pressure he actually runs himself right into it there with Redick, who's so good on the edge does enough there to affect Stroud you can see McDonald helping to clean that up They play man coverage behind that pressure. Just nowhere to go with that football. So the punter is Tommy Townsend. Xavier Gibson is back. Townsend came over from Kansas City where he won a couple of Super Bowls with the Chiefs. High floating kick. Fair caught at the 11-yard line. And that's where Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets will take over on this Thursday night. Here go the Jets from the 11-yard line. Rodgers out of the pistol. Straight drop back. Throws deep down the sideline. But out of bounds there. Intended for Devontae Adams. Covered there by Derek Stingley. Second and ten. So Aaron Rodgers this season, he's had better years, many better. 12 touchdowns, 7 interceptions, not too bad, but only 62%, 237 yards per game. So he's the fewest in a lot of categories to this point of any season he's played. And that was one of the first times we've seen Devontae Adams, his former teammate, get downfield. And he was open on a stuttering goal. He went by Stingley. Rodgers misses it. Second and 10. Looks the other way. Fires over him. Let's drop. At the 15-yard line, tries to get it to Brees Hall, who's normally a very good pass catcher, in addition to being an outstanding runner. Quickly third and ten. If you're wondering how the Jets' season is going, Al just read some of the numbers. Here's two plays. A missed play, a missed go ball down that right sideline, and then a drop here for five yards by Brees Hall. Third and ten. So there have been eight plays in this game. Six for Houston. two for the Jets no runs, all passes pass number nine look out, gets sacked at the one yard line so that's Nico Autry who comes in for the sack another one of the guys they picked up the Bluebirds come out very early Autry a free agent was with Tennessee last year for that with the Colts and the Raiders gets the sack here. And the problem here when you get to third and long with these ends that they have, Will Anderson and Danelle Hunter, they're so quick off the edge that it frees up to middle to get one-on-ones. They actually end up bringing six. And if you're a Texans fan, how great is it to see Autry showing what he can do? He had 11.5 sacks a year ago with Tennessee, gets his first with the Texans. so Thomas Morstead right at the end of the end zone very little room to get it away but he does and it's a good kick it goes out of bounds near midfield and the Texans will take over at that spot with 11.44 remaining in the opening quarter let's take a look at our next gen stats powered by AWS look at that interior offensive line through the first eight weeks of the season 15.5 sacks allowed. That's the most in the entire NFL. You see the pressure the most. And now you get the Jets who can get after it, create pressure, much like this Houston defense can. So, as you said, in a lot of passes, see if they get Joe Mixon in this run game involved here and try to create a little bit more balance on this crowd. He is the running back in the set. And before Mixon can get it and take off, Another flag. Unsold a left tackle. Go start. Offense number 78. Five-yard penalty. His first down. Well, let's not stop the presses. He leads the league in penalty. Less than. Well. How about we start over? That's a good idea. Anyway, we were talking to Aaron Rodgers the other day. And he was, in a way, convincing, telling us that he knew a path. Very thorough. Very thorough. Went through the entire schedule. Meanwhile, you've got the kick here again. Morstead, or the kick is Tommy Townsend. Still fair catch it. Start from there. He was, you know, Aaron, he can sell you a few things. So I went out and I was going to buy the Brooklyn Bridge after that conversation. But I settled for the Williamsburg. But it's interesting how he went through every game. He says two West Coast teams coming in and playing at 10 o'clock in the morning game. And then Miami could be anything. He also compared some of his Green Bay teams that got off to a slow start. And he talked about this team and this team. And he goes, this Jets team's better than a lot of those teams as far as, if you look at some of the personnel. You look at the rest of their schedule. If they can get a win tonight. If they can. Yeah. So that's a short game here. To Devontae Adams, tackled by Murray, gained a three. So for Rodgers, that's the way it starts tonight. Yeah, I mean, he's had some open receivers, just not able to get on track here and being able to just be able to find them. You know, whether it's him or the receivers, whatever it is, they're just not on the same page yet. Yeah. Trying to pick up the pace. He went no huddle here. Put the play clock all the way down to 12, so. Hardly a hurry up. Yeah, for a team that's struggled with their operation at times. Remember last week they had a call timeout with a clock run down. This is good to mix this in. Yeah. They had to use all three in the first half. They had to delay a game on a two-point conversion. Here's Brees Hall for a minimal gain. Third down and six. With this defensive line for Houston, they've got strength and quickness in the inside. They've rotated a lot of balls. Too early for that, Benny. It was really too early. That's a shot you normally see late in the fourth. Third and six. Look out. Rodgers spins away, throws, caught. Ball is out. Is it a fumble? Did he have control? Meanwhile, this is Neville Ewed for the moment, who's going to take the ball all the way in for a touchdown. Yeah, they called that a catch and a fumble on the field. Look at it again. That's Tyler Conklin. Great job. I'm sure they're going to take a peek at this. They do. In fact, he has possession of this. But the Texans playing, that ball is such an incompletion. That ball is bobbled. Totally. So the Jets this time catch a break. Right. I mean, the officials are talking, hey, let it go. Let it play. We'll take a look at it again. Ruling on the field of a touchdown is under further review. And to be overturned. So we had a near touchdown for the Jets. We have a sort of near touchdown for these guys. The good thing, you know, there's also, by the way, Rodgers hasn't been able to move around much in the pocket lately. Nope. Showed it there. It was nice. Knocked away by Petrie there. Causing the incompletion. And there's Conklin. the recipient of the pass. Meanwhile, you've got Morrsted back to punt. His third of the night. Townsend's already punted three times. And Stephen Sims is back for the Jets inside the 30-yard line. Sims Backing up Beautiful kick Look at this baby Whoa Two yard line Let's play the game By far Thomas Morstead That is 75 yards Of perfection absolutely another peak not only angled deep sims had to go over but then somehow stays inbounds and down to the two yard line great job by Bernard Converse not jumping and getting sometimes you see these guys get nervous and jump on the ball he let that roll all the way down to the two yard line so Morriston's punted Clients can even book the CJ special if they'd like his look, guys. You know, the next time we're down in Houston, what do you think? Sign me up. What was the old Vidal Sassoon line? If you don't look good, we don't look good, right? That's right. Something like that. You always have a tight cut when you come in on Thursday. Yeah, right. More hair on my chest than I do on my head and stage. Anyway, you know the news. At the 30-yard line, the Jets and Rodgers go back to work. All right, here we go, 321. Here we go. See if the Jets can get on the board. Rodgers, 4 out of 9 for 14 yards. Got both backs in the back of the hole and Allen. down to number zero both go into the pattern pass is caught, breaking away picking up the first down, spinning away that time is Devontae Adams to pick up the first. That's a great job of getting him into football where he has a chance to do something after the catch, pretty tight in the interior there Jewel at 43, the inside linebacker, he's looking right there, but he's able to shake free from him he still has that Littability. You always think about his release at the line of scrimmage. Making plays downfield. But that time doing it after the catch. The ground. And nothing there. Kenny Coteau stopping Brees Hall in his tracks. Clock running down to 240. A guy that we've not seen yet make a play. Really not give many opportunities. Garrett Wilson. Last week he exploded five catches. 113 yards and a loss to New England. And I think a lot of people felt with the attention that Adams can create, Wilson's going to get more chances. But just so far tonight, this first half, just the one target is down at the bottom of your screen. Well, the Jets have only had the ball for a little over eight minutes. There's the pass out here. Speaking of him, of course, the minute you mention him, he gets into the play, but for nothing there. Lassiter makes the tackle, and that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. I was going to say, Lassner, man, he doesn't get a lot of attention because Stingley's Halloween night. The perfect night for Key and the quarterback. We come with a third and ten for the Jets from their own 42-yard line. Extra pressure. And Rodgers is going to get sacked. Put the heat on and down he goes. So it looked like Hunter was the first guy to get there. Danico Autry finished him off. And the 30-second timeout is taken here by New York. What an addition to Neil Hunter has been. Both of these guys, Autry, now that he's back. Look at that wide stance there by Hunter. Usually Anderson's on the other side, but, boy, he gets able to get around Tyron Smith, and it makes him step up. And that's what we've seen more from Aaron Rodgers in recent weeks, is just the pressure gets to him, and he just kind of doesn't have the ability to try to fight to get out of there. and this defensive line really dialing up that pressure and winning the battle up front. Autry, two sacks tonight. Timeout taken by Houston. So they have a ton of time. They still have two timeouts. Jets are going to get the ball to start the second half. Here Morrsted whose last punt was 75 yards pinned him at the two but the Texans took it 98 And that the difference in the game right now Short, floating kick, fair catch goal for May 29 yard line by Stephen Sims. Take a break here for 30 seconds. So Stroud and company, Stroud 6 out of 13 for 84 yards. Mixon has been the big man tonight. Now you've got Blake Fisher in there. Rookie out of Notre Dame up front. Mixon takes it up to the 32-yard line, second down. A hard run goes right through Isaiah Oliver, who is coming up in run support. near the end of this run. We keep talking about mixing. Look at that tough run. That right shoulder went right through his face mask. Again, with Nico Collins down and Stephon Diggs down, you wonder who, not just tonight, but especially this moment, minute 20 to go, can Stroud find the timing with these other receivers? Necessarily, man, he's picked up this offense. I mean, he doesn't even think he's involved in the play. And, of course, Aaron, who improvises so often on the fly, You can see his face looking at Adams like, man, come on, we've got to get this going. Third and nine. Rodgers. And a little too far. That's incomplete. Intended from Mike Williams, who could very much be on the trading block. The boos rain down on the Jets. Fourth and nine. Yeah, and without Will Anderson, you know, they'll blitz with Anderson in there, but they feel a lot of times they can get pressure with just four. Look at all these bodies. You've got seven guys, one drops. They still bring the nickel, Petrie. And because of that pressure, Aaron Rodgers just not settled, not comfortable, able to find that rhythm and that accuracy with another open receiver. So Thomas Morrsted drafted in 2009. He and Matthew Stafford are the only players remaining from that draft. Stafford went number one. Meanwhile, that is out of bounds at around the 13-yard line. and Morstead winning a very late round. Anyway, we're back in 30 seconds. No score at the Meadowlands. Being moved for a year now, and finally they make the move and winds up here with his old buddy. Yeah, I think everybody's expected, oh, my gosh, he's here. It's all going to work out. Blink of an eye, everything's going to be perfect, and they're still trying to find their rhythm. This drive starts at the 13-yard line, again finding that crease. Mixon tackle there by number 52. Sam will be on, and it'll be second down. This is a defense that is athletic as they are, and as much as they can pressure the quarterback, they have been vulnerable into the interior. Remember, you've got your two starting safeties down. You've got your starting middle linebacker and C.J. Mosley down. So you would think that if you can attack, it would be in the interior with this run game tonight with Mixon. and clean up Sam's name. The Globin. Don't want to hear from the folks. Second and three. There you go. Cross back here. Off he goes again. Starts to stumble. Maintains his balance and picks up a nice game here. But a flag is down. And the Texans are already starting back. Holding by the offense number 87. The 10-yard penalty replay second down. That was a 17-yard gain. Instead, it's Cade Stover with the penalty. Yeah, safety came down 23, Oliver and Stover, the rookie out of Ohio State. He's just trying to help whether you go inside or outside. Here he's trying to push Oliver, the safety out, but that mobility of the safety is able to get away from him, so he's got to grab on to the jersey. That play had a chance to be a big one. Meanwhile, you've got D.J. Reid getting assistance as he goes over to the sideline. So the corner coming out at least for one play. She trots to the sideline. After the penalty now, it's going to be second down and 11. Five and a half left in a first quarter that has not been played with alacrity. Second and 11. From the 12. Four-man rush. Enough to get him on the ground back at the 7-yard line. It's not that we're picking on Kenyon Green. It's just it's been a rough year for him. You know, he got benched last week, and Jared Patterson came in for him, but he got injured, so Green went back in, and he's got ability. I think right now he's just getting overpowered. Quentin Williams just goes right through him. So we've seen him go around him with quickness, getting that leverage to be able to work the round. And that time just used his power to go right through him. And by the way, it's a combination of Green struggling and Quentin Williams really playing up to his level in the last three or four weeks. So in the first less than 11 minutes of the game, we've got three sacks for the Jets. Meanwhile, the pass here and out to the 18-yard line goes Tank Dell. But it's fourth down and six. In comes the punt group. We go to Kaylee. Guys, after Tommy Townsend got run into on his last punt, he came to the sideline. He took a couple practice punts into the net, gave a thumbs up to the staff. He used a massage gun on his right calf and even practiced holding. And there he is. So he is back. Xavier Gibson sets up inside his 30. So Townsend to put it in the air for the second official time. And the third time overall, cutting the running into him. Mixon again. So Mixon, despite that ankle injury costing him three games plus part of another, he's on a pace to run for over 1,400 yards this season. Yeah, amazing. Mikko Ryan's interesting decision here. Looks like now they're going a little bit faster. Saving the two timeouts. Clock at 50. Trout throws. That's caught. Tank Dell. Tank Dell down the sideline. And Tank Dell out of bounds. Stopping the clock with 43 seconds. So he gets free. Nixon threw a nice block to spring him for 34 yards. Yeah, a mesh route with Mechie coming from the left side. Reed gets caught up in the traffic. So he is free. Nobody there to pick him up in man coverage. And there's the speed that he showed last year as a rookie after the catch. Remember, he broke his leg at week 13 a year ago. hasn't quite been the same guy, but now with more opportunities, everyone's very hopeful he can become the receiver that he was last year when he was making plays downfield. Well, Mixon pushed the defender out of the way, provide space for him. First down from 34, Stroud. He's going to the end zone. Kind of contact there, but all incidental and incomplete. Jennifer Hutchinson, first time he's been targeted tonight. second and ten. Much better coverage downfield that time by Sauce Gardner. Stayed on top and once again, what's new? 95 in the middle. Does a really good job of being able to just fight. I mean, he's playing with such different effort and a really good job of not getting too low where they protect the quarterback after the throw. Pressure. Stroud. It's Faroon. Incomplete here. Ogumbo Wally, the intended receiver. So with 33 ticks, third and ten. Jets went man coverage that time. as we talked about before this drive got started, who can win against that man coverage? We saw Dell on that mesh route where he was able to kind of work through that traffic to spring free, but these last few plays, good coverage by the Jets here against these receivers. Bobby Sloag is Dad Bob, longtime assistant coach. Looked on Mike Shanahan's staff for a number of years. Third down and ten. hanging in the pocket. And down he goes. A big sack, taking him deeper into what would be field goal territory that Solomon Thomas, meanwhile now you've got Stroud is down with 26 seconds. Oh, baby. Oh, boy. Well, with the edge pressure with Redick and McDonald, look at them push. It makes the quarterback want to step up. Now if you get a push in the middle from Thomas, that's how you get sacks in the interior with that edge pressure. Houston has charged their second timeout of the half. This occurred before the Jets' timeout. Please reset the game clock to 27 seconds. Thank you. So the clock goes to 27. The backup quarterback would be Davis Mills. I talked to CJ on the field before the game, just how you're feeling, short week. He's like kind of whispered to me, man, I'm kind of banged up right now. And, you know, he's fighting like a lot of guys on short weeks. He's fighting through. There's Davis Mills, who is a very capable backup, was a starter just a couple years ago before C.J. was drafted. Just good to see him up and walking off. So he'll get the halftime break to get whatever treatment is there. Still, yeah. Well, yeah, that's a leg. Yeah, with that left leg. Meanwhile, Fairbairn's going into the game. Yes, for sure. That's a 15-yard penalty. They would have caught that. But they didn't. So instead, now you've got a 56-yard field goal attempt for Fairbairn. Nine for ten this season. Within his range. The distance, but not the accuracy. Jets will take whatever break they can get. Front because they play so hard that they rotate eight or nine guys, but a lot of injuries. God forbid. Good. First down. Here goes Mixon again. And he finally gets stuck before he can turn the corner. Second down. It's good to see, again, the corners in this style of defense, a lot of times they'll set the tone with a willingness to tackle. And Eccles here, who is in, again, has got to be able to step up and make a play for Reed. It looks like Robert Woods was mixed up there on who to block, but at least there's a willingness there from the corner to come up and make a play. Only good news for the Jets, they finally get the two starting corners back. Reed and Gardner both come back into the game. Second and 12. Finally, a lot of time for Strava. The secondary does its work. He's going to take off, and he's going to get the first down at the 14-yard line. So on second and 12, he gets it up for the first. Yeah, and again, let's watch this. The left guard, instead, he's going to pull and lead, try to help out. Watch him take care of Redick, especially once you see right here, boom, nice block. And now you've got C.J. Stroud. This is an area that C.J. Stroud really grew in his years at Ohio State, Early in his career, he'd sit in the pocket late in his career, especially his last game against Georgia in his semifinal game. He really started to show what he could do outside of the pocket and really has taken off the last year and a half in the NFL doing that. Inside five minutes to the half. Nixon gets stuffed in the back wheel and been slung down there by Leonard Taylor. So the Jets right now, they're already minus Adams, Ashton Davis, C.J. Mosley. Tonight, Reed's gotten hurt. Gardner, Herbert, they're both back in. And McDonald is on the sideline for the moment. Bobby Sloick, the offensive coordinator, has tried to match wits tonight with Jeff Albrick. And what he's doing without his receivers is he's changing the looks. Sometimes he's got one tight end, sometimes two. 11 personnel would be the one tight end and the one back. 12, sometimes 12 personnel with two tight ends. That's what he has here right now with Stover and Schultz in there. Schultz almost acting as a receiver. There he was out of the slot. Stroud has to fling it away as he was under pressure again that time. Javon Kinlaw chased him out. A little over four to go. It's third down and 12. The game remains scoreless. Kinlaw's making plays. You saw him in that run being able to slip and shoot a gap against the run. And in that time, great effort. We just talked about how they like to rotate, try to stay fresh because of how hard they play. It's a penetrating front. It likes to get into that backfield. They get worn out up front. Texans, third and ten plus. They are the best in the league at converting in these third and longs. Agunbo Wally is in the backfield. Third and twelve. On the move. Throws, and that is pulled in Tank Dell for a first down. Needed 12, picked up 14. First and goal on a drive that started back at their own two-yard line. Watch Clemens work on a little stunt that affects the communication. He flushes Stroud, but how about Stroud? What we love about C.J. Stroud is his eyes are downfield as he's running to try to buy time, and then the accuracy of that throw there on third and long, once again, they convert. Fourteenth play of the drive. Give it to Mixon. Goes in for the touchdown. And if anybody ever deserves a touchdown after a drive like that, it's that guy. Fifteen carries tonight. Eighty-five yards. So Morrish that pins them at their own two, and they go 98 in 14 plays. Yeah, and finally you see some offense here. Quincy Williams, he just shot in, pinched it, tried to see if he could blow that play up. But I tell you, the way Mixon's running this year, the vision, the jump cut, once he got around Quincy Williams, there's nobody there. 98-yard drive. So it's 8.23 off the clock. timey fair baron to kick the extra point and finally some numbers on the scoreboard with 321 to go in the first half and the Houston Texans leading the New York Jets 7-0 on Thursday night football Malachi Corley a rookie at a Western Kentucky 19 yards pulling the Texans into the end zone he goes. The question is, does he drop the football before he crosses the plane? It's going to be very, very close. That's what D'Amico Ryans is looking at. He's waiting for the replays, waiting for the guys upstairs. He doesn't have to really, but his all scoring plays get reviewed. The execution, everything's great. Oh, boy, he dropped that ball. That's close. Definitely going to take a peek at that. There's a good view. Rolling on the field of a touchdown is under further review. It is. Terry McCauley, what are you seeing? Yeah, I see he clearly drops the football before it breaks the plane. Now, what we have to go through is see what happens to the football after that. If the Jets recover, it's a touchdown. If Houston recovers, it's a touchback. Or if it goes out of bounds, it's a touchback. If it just sits there with no recovery, then it's going to go back to the Jets at the spot of the fumble. So, where does the ball wind up? It's mysterious, and we'll hold that for you until we come. The runner dropped the ball before crossing the goal line. The ball then subsequently rolled to the back of the end zone out of bounds, which is considered an immediate recovery. It is a touchback. it's a first down for the defense. There's the ball. There it goes, rolling to the back line. Once that ball hits that white, it's the Texans' ball for a touchback. And the rookie, Corley, what in the heck is he thinking? Why the urgency for some of these guys to drop the ball before they, even if it's close, finish the play. Absolutely. You see it time and time again. to the first rush of his career. He'll remember it forever from the 20-yard line. Mixon looking for room. Meanwhile, in that situation, had the Jets recovered in the end zone, it would have been a touchdown. It rolled out of the end zone, so it comes out to the 20-yard line. And keep in mind, you're talking about a team that's struggling. They've lost five in a row. Their interim head coach, he's been the head coach for three games. This is a team that's 2-6. They're desperate to get a win, desperate to do all the little things right. And we've seen the same errors, especially a big one there where they could be up 7 and feeling good about where they are. Second and 8. Stroud has time, but the coverage is good, and he gets taken down to the 25-yard line by Quincy Williams. This Jets defense is doing everything that they can to kind of bail out their own offense, whether it's been when the offense has given the Texans good field position, they were able to get off the field, whether it was like this, a mistake that was made. Now they're trying again, once again, to try to help their own offense out, get good field position back to Aaron Rodgers. set at the top. The way they've lost these five games in every manner. Now you've got this. That's something new. It comes back to haunt them on Halloween night. Meanwhile, over the middle. Too high. Intended for John Metchie. Stroud goes down. Underneath Quinnen Williams who gets to him again. And it's fourth down. Another pressure. This time it's Quinnen Williams again on that Left side, Green, who's actually down. When Williams went through him on the left side, he's lined up out here, but he'll work in. It's that left guard spot again for the Texans. See that rip move? And it's not just always about the sack. It's about affecting the quarterback. And Mechie does a pretty good job here working across this field, trying to get separation, which he gains. but because of that pressure it gets Stroud a little bit in a bit of a hurry there. You can see as he threw the football he got hit by Quentin Williams. So Green who was picked in the first round back in 2022 came out of last week's game yanked and Jared Patterson went in he got hurt. Green had to come back. Patterson inactive tonight and now Green is down on the turf here at Life. early in the second quarter and a game being played in quicksand there's zero flow to this football game so far that's his 13th accepted penalty against Tunsell this year that's the most we're talking about A lot of negativity tonight. That's the most in the NFL for him as well. So we've got the interior, most pressure, left tackle, most penalties. But we promise it's going to get a lot better here. The Jets, in a moment of darkness, as they say, choose to wear black tonight on top of it all. First and 15 now. Finally a run for only a couple. So, Mixon, eighth year in the league, running back gets to that point. They begin to think, or you begin to think, okay, he's going to lose a little bit. Not this guy this year. Al, I'm with you. Watching him throughout his career, you know, going all the way back to Oklahoma with his years with the Bengals, I think it did. I think a lot of people thought, okay, his best years are behind him. I think he looks like he's almost a rookie. He's running with more power and more, just looks more explosive. averaging almost five yards a carry is the best for him since going all the way back to 2018. So I think a change of scenery helped him out. That was a gain of two, second and 13. Look out from behind, gets sacked. That time it's D.J. Reid off the corner to get the sack. Tracked him down from behind. He ends up bringing the pressure this time. You've got D.J. Reid lined up right here on Schultz to tie it in, and they're just going to bring that corner pressure. He's got one too many on the left side. They overload that way, and Reed, who is a really tough corner, really good in coverage, undersized, but plays with an attitude, at times able to get home. Doesn't blitz very often. In fact, it's his first sack in six years when he was with the 49ers, second career sack for him. Third and 21 now. Stroud stepping up fires and it's almost intercepted at the 42 yard line Jalen Mills diving for it on a pass intended for tank belt so the Jets defense does its work Rogers getting ready to go back to work get a little bit of pressure out here from Redick who of course on third down he has such good get off he's able to work around but CJ Stroud steps up just kind of flips that wrist and very dangerous as you said Clark almost Steps in front of that ball for a huge interception. Please reset the game clock to 10-15. Thank you. All right, so we played four minutes and 45 seconds. Had three penalties. Three sacks. and Townsend second putt here and here's a flag again he got knocked down you know what this is going to mean is it running into a roughing and he is on the ground so Tommy Townsend gets run into and the Texans right now it's amazing how many roughing the kicker defense number 19 it's a 15 yard penalty and an automatic First down. Irvin Charles. How many times this year have we seen either the place kicker or the punter get run into him? Yeah. Terry McCauley is saying, watch his plant leg, the left leg. Once you run into that, that's going to be roughing. So he is called on. You know, again, the Jets have a chance. Their defense does a job. Get off the field. Chance to get the football back. And, again, another microcosm of their season there where they give C.J. Stroud the ball now in plus territory after that mistake. Yeah. And that was a fourth and 21. So a first down. The ball is on the 49 of the Jets. Stroud has started two out of seven for 22 yards. Mixon. Picks up about three. Reed in the tackle there. Second down and seven. He's really beaten. And there's taking a look at the punter there when he came down. Like we said, he's run into on that playing foot. Hopefully he's okay. D'Amico Ryan's trying to get this offense going. Such potential, even with Diggs and Collins down. They want to run the football tonight to get the defense, especially that secondary, concerned about Mixon to set up that play-action game. Try him again. Big enough hole here and close to a first down. Joe Mixon stopped by Oliver. It'll be third down and short. The left side here, Kenyon Green takes so much from the media and from the fans. The operation's clean. Good snap, good hole. He hits it good. He just pushes it right. Al, you said he had the distance. By the way, Aaron Rodgers in his entire career, it's the fewest yards in the first half of any game where he's attempted at least 10 passes. He's got 27 yards passing. 27. Previous low was 37. Right. 12 of them on one pass to Adams. So now the Jets. With Rodgers, of course, he's capable, obviously, the king of the Hail Mary. What's he going to do here? Tries to get a little closer. That'll stop the clock. He hits Adams there. Everything's been pretty short tonight. They have field goal kicking issues, obviously, with what's been going on in recent weeks. They certainly do. Now you've got Patterson, who was just signed. He's been around. Journeyman kicker. He's Greg Zerline. Wasn't doing the job. He's hurt. Patterson, fourth year in the league. Been with Detroit a couple of times. Jacksonville. Cleveland. See if he gets a shot. Second five. And that is going to be not hold in. Adams was there, had to reach down for it He got Stingley covering on the play Rodgers looks at the heavens 35 What a matchup there with Adams against a young corner Stingley, he actually beats him He's as good as there is with that release Ball's there, he's just unable to hold on to it Gives both hands on it Looks like that's a sure catch For a guy like Devontae Adams Put him in great field goal range At the very least But an incompletion Aaron probably thinking I've got to get back to Peru or someplace. He's got him again, one-on-one. Third and five. And that's broken up. Adams, the intended receiver again, broken up here by Stingley, 12 seconds. And it shows you the confidence that D'Amico Ryans has with his young corners. He put them out there on islands, believing that Stingley can win that one-on-one matchup. Adams won the last one. Watch this. Great recognition. Ball's out in front. Stingley in position. That right arm comes down and knocked that ball away. Jets can't take a chance on going for it because on fourth down they didn't make it. One pass and Texans might be in field goal shape again. So Morrsted comes in the punt. punt number five for him delay of game five-yard penalty, it's fourth down no big deal here with the ball at midfield so the interim coach, Jeff Ulbrich again, it's interesting because he was the defensive coordinator under Robert Sallin and instead of handing off that role he's trying to do two things at once, it's his first head coaching opportunity in the middle of the year Right, middle of the season. That's tough. Apart from that, no problem. So fourth down, Morristead. Sends that one into the end zone with five seconds left in the first half.

And for Aaron Rodgers, 7 out of 14, 32 yards. No truth to the rumor that in the Jets locker room at halftime they were playing Hello Darkness, my old friend. Just wanted to spell that rumor. Fake news. Fake news. In case you're wondering. That was a tough half. Very. Yeah. It's going to get a lot better here. That's where we go. It's going to be much better execution. Promise? Yeah. Jets start at the 30, and we go to Kaylee. Well, Brick, your offensive struggles continue. What will it take to get points on the board? Yeah, we've got to eliminate the first and second down, just mistakes. Whether it's penalties or execution, we've got to clean it up so that third down is manageable. Frustrated with him at left guard. Watch this block right here. This is what you want to see. Get into him, engage, and then bury him. open that up, that's a nice pancake, and look at that hole open up for Mixon. And Solomon Thomas gets hurt on the play. Been having a pretty decent year, but they work on Thomas as we step away. Players, the block that we referred to earlier, gets blocked into his lower body, gets rolled up on, good to just see him walking that off. Texans not quite able to pick up that first down on that run by Mixon, So, at a third and short. Third and inches just inside the 40-yard line. Still early in the first quarter. To the outside he goes. Nixon bouncing off tackles. Running through tackles all the way to the 11-yard line. When we're talking about Nixon in his eighth season, how much juice does he have left? That proves it. Yeah, what a run here. What a jump cut. Because there's penetration. If you watch real close with 72, Clemens, he's able to work around green. Boom, that cut right there. Picks up the first down. Then he throws that shoulder, and there it is, Al. This is a different Joe Mixon. Physicality running through those would-be tackles. That was Chuck Clark coming up. What a gain there. 29-yard pickup for Mixon. First down at the 11-yard line. Oster, Oster, Oster. Got to go. 18. That's up. Gunbowale is now in the backfield. Darre has it. Goes nowhere. Stuffed. Line of scrimmage or a yard behind by Quinnen Williams. Second down and 11. Good job on the backside of that Jets defense. Flowing to the football. Not taking a playoff. And he wanted to try to cut that back. But there's just no room because of the hustle and effort on the backside. This is where you miss Collins. You miss Diggs. down in these areas where you've got to make quick decisions as a quarterback. This is where Tank Dell in the slot on the left. Really has got to get a chance to get into that open hole. Stroud. Pressure again. Loses the ball. And the Jets come up with the football inside the 20-yard line. Will McDonald is the man who recovered it. Quinton Williams forced the issue. And there it is. That interior. Kenyon Green. Right here, that left guard. He's got to be able to match up tonight. Tough tough task Quinn Williams has been coming on in recent weeks Good penetration Good job of knocking the ball out away from C Stroud Now it on the ground and Will McDonald jumps on top of it So the Jets, their offense has not been able to get going. The defense has come up with some big stops. So Stroud who played the worst game of his career in this ballpark last year. Losing to the Jets and suffered a concussion as well. off to a ragged start tonight. Huge hole, but then they put it on the ground, and he recovers it. So, Hall, off to a good start on that run with a lot of room. Gets a little excited, loses the football, but comes up with it again. Meanwhile, now you've got Will Anderson, who is down for the Texans and bent over. Chet's very fortunate to get that football back. It looked like Hewitt knocked it out of there. Boy, that is one of the better players in the NFL. Will Anderson off the edge. Great player, not just in a pass rush, but also against a run. Another lower body. He was just named the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October. So they work on Will Anderson. Step away. And needs assistance into the blue tent. and here's what happened to him on that last play so the Jets Neville Hewitt will come in Will Anderson at least out for the moment up front they still have they still have Daniel Hunter on the other side yeah, the move of Huntry who has the ability to play inside or outside he's not right now opposite of Hunter second and nine well what's happening there Devontae Adams sort of that's pretty odd isn't it after all those years together in Green Bay well it's odd he's blocking Stingley downfield and I think it just shows you that even though he's been here now for a few weeks it's still a work in progress with Devontae Adams just because he has that experience with Aaron Rodgers He's does impatient, and a couple of Rodgers recognized passes so he's been able to get out quickly. Big hole here. Closes in a hurry. 25-yard line. Breaks hold. We go to Kaylee. Guys, the Jets started making some headway on offense here without defensive end Will Anderson on the field for the Texans. We saw him through the first half trying to fight through an ankle injury, but he has been downgraded to questionable because of it. And when the Texans' offense gets back on the field, they will not have left guard Kenyon Green. He's been ruled out. Well, Anderson has been in and out since he went into the blue tent. Out right now, second down and three. Rodgers' time, throws into traffic, caught, and that's a first down. So Mike Williams had a lot of good years, of course, with the Chargers. Comes over, hasn't done much here. Picks up the first down. That was a tight window, and he makes an accurate throw to give Mike Williams a chance in there with those linebackers. Jets are going a little bit of tempo here. It's the 10th play of this drive. Again, great patience so far by Rodgers and the Jets. Five runs, four passes. You're on the ball. Good on. 39. 3-19. Good tackle right in the backfield. Brees hole taken down. Tim Settle comes diving in to stop him literally second down to 12 after a loss of two yards. What a year Settle has had coming over from Buffalo. Not only ability to buy into this system and get sacks. You know, he's got four coming into tonight. But a lot of tackles for a loss because of ability to make plays like that. Again, this defense is predicated upon that defensive line just getting upfield, being disruptive. You see 96, Autry, who can play inside, but with the injury, Anderson is pushed outside. Second and 12. Rodgers under pressure. It goes one-handed, caught. Wilson, touchdown. That's it. Yeah, gets a break. A doink, but through. From the two-yard line, Stephen Sims. From the outside, he goes taken down with the 29-8 penalty. During the return, personal file face mask by the kicking team, number 88. 15 yards will be added to the end of the play. It's first down. Taking an in-game field. Well, we talked about the Jets plenty tonight. But the Meeko Ryans, you know, they finally got it right in Houston. Bill O'Brien was there for a number of years, and then Romeo Cornell took over in the middle of the season. They had David Cully. They had Lovie Smith. I think they really got it right. This guy is special. Yeah, I think he relates to the players in a way that very few guys can. And look at what he did as a player. So he has respect there from these guys. Then you look what he did. He paid his dues and assistant, became a coordinator, and he's got an infectious attitude and energy about it. Stroud, that's taken over the end of the first half. Chased by McDonald. Good to see him back. And, you know, with Ryan's, he was with the Texans, so he knows the organization six years. He goes to Philadelphia before, and he said his first year in Philly was Andy Reid's last year. He took a lot away from Andy Reid in the way Andy Reid is around a football team. Yeah, yeah. And then he was able to go out, obviously, with San Francisco and watch and learn from some of the best. And then he gets his opportunity. And I think what he's done a really nice job of is he's taken all of that, but he's being true to himself and who he is. And, man, it hit the first year. He changed that culture in Houston. He's got some young players. They're a team on the go right now. Meanwhile, close to a first down goes Joe Mixon. Tackled there by D.J. Reid. It will be third down. Back to go to Kaylee. Guys, you won't find anybody dozing off in a D'Amico Ryan's-led meeting. Jalen Petrie told me, Ryan's is so energetic. It's like he's at a party screaming and all that. You wouldn't know it, though, if you talked to him away from that environment as Stroud runs for a first down. Man-to-man coverage. Not expecting C.J. Stroud to hold on to that ball and short yardage. And good call there to get him out on the edge. Nobody accounts for him. See Todd Downing there talking to Aaron Rodgers about that last try. See, they're expecting, of course, Joe Mixon to run into the middle. That's where all the defenders were. You can see Sherwood has his back there turned. And the move again. Seats the sideline. Robert Woods adjusting back. This is a drill that they work on because of Stroud's ability to play off schedule. What a job. The left foot's down for sure. Does the right foot get down with a toe tap? Did he drag it? It looks like it is. What a play by the veteran there. So he makes up for that holding call to negate the 15-yard gain. What I loved is how he's running around. He sees his quarterback's in trouble. He works inside. Now he sees in trouble. Work back. Gives Stroud an option. And then toe tap there. Watch that right foot. Beautiful play there. Yeah, you see the pebbles come up? Yeah. That's always the telltale sign. So Gardner misses a tackle. Gets beat on that play. Stroud rolling under pressure. Throwing. and that pass is incomplete. You got another flag. That down is, you had Leonard Taylor coming in. Meanwhile, you got Gardner is down. And we'll hear from Hockley in a second. Before the pass was thrown, Burley, defense number one. The five-yard penalty and an automatic first down. Oh, baby, that's a bad trifecta. You got a missed tackle. You get beaten. Then you got a penalty and you're hurt. Yeah, Sauce Gardner, who is looked at and viewed coming into this year, there's the grab right there, is one of the top corners in the league with his length and with the way he's played. And this year, you know, like a lot of the Chets players, things have not been the same. And teams, in fact, have not avoided him. They've actually gone after him. Well, he had five penalties all of last year. He has five already this season. Defensive Rookie of the Year back in 22. Texas trying to come up with answers because of that left guard situation. And a lot of the answers are moving Stroud around, run the football, and then get him away from that pressure from the interior. Remember, coming into tonight, they're dead last as far as the amount of pressures they allow through that interior. And the Jets have taken advantage of that. Kendall Sheffield, 27, comes in for Gardner. There goes Mixon again. an 11-yard gain for Joe Mixon. And Joe Mixon now, we had another injury here, but that's 12 carries for 86 yards. And you got Will McDonald, who is the injured jet. You know, Kendrick Green does a pretty good job here. We're talking about that left guard. How is he going to do? Helps out with Tunsil, cleaning it up. He's able to work up there. Got away with a hold with his left arm. But they're really having success again through that interior of this Jets defense. In 99, McDonald still down on the field. He leads the team in sacks. He has eight. Please reset the game clock to 641. Thank you. So still down. So you had Anderson going out for a while for the Texans. He's their leading sacker. And now you've got McDonald down. Adams and Rogers going, I don't know what they're talking about right now. We've got to get something going here. This drive started, remember, back at the two after that 75-yard punt. Here's a McDonald play again. It's like he avoids contact for the most part. And that effort to avoid it must have tweaked something. Non-contact injury there. And that's what took Diggs out last week. ACL, line for the season. Gardner on the sideline for a moment. Joe Mixon is doing a nice job. He's the beneficiary of the way they've been blocking in the interior, averaging over seven yards of carry, and they've mixed up their personnel, keeping this Jets defense off balance. You know, we've seen Mixon for years, but, I mean, he's looking as good as I've ever seen. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's the best he's looked in probably six or seven years. another bad sign for the NYJ a big part of this defensive front is the depth that they typically have had over the years and rotating they're so violent, so aggressive so much fireman Ed there frustrated might need him here to get some depth for that defensive front very well read guy, very smart and is very convincing I mean, I was sitting there going, wait a second. They can't run the table, and then he makes you think they can. By the time we're done, we're like, he makes a good point. They got a shot. If they could win Thursday, who knows? Off you go into the wild blue yonder. So, who knows? Three touchdown games. Nobody's expecting Stroud to run it, so good call there, utilizing his legs. J.J. Taylor is now the running back. for a couple of plays tonight. And they called his number, and then he trips and falls. Might have picked up a few more, might have had a first down, but instead down he goes, thanks to the turf monster. I'll tell you, the job that Kendrick Green has done at left guard, in for the injured Kenyon Green, who's really struggled in the first half against Quentin Williams. Green, 53, holding his own. Doing a pretty good job, you know, whether it's been run or passed, They were moving him around quite a bit as well. But that offensive line in that first half, they were dealing with a lot of aggressive approach by the Jets. The Jets were very disruptive, but things have slowed down a bit with 53 in there on the left side. Second and a long one. Give it to Taylor again. And Taylor gets taken down after he picks up a first down on the 24-yard line. So good opening drives. Meanwhile, a little skirmish breaks out. Nothing major. Good opening drives for both teams. Right on cue, 53 green with a block and then gets downfield. He's looking for a little extra effort 10 yards downfield. It's a pretty good answer so far by Houston after that impressive opening drive by the Jets. They're coming right back down deep into the Jets' territory here. on this drive they've all been runs Mixon approaching 100 yards play action pass high and not hold in by Tank Dell reached up for it, couldn't hold it in makes it second down and 10 and Stroud is now 7 for 17 for 115 yards he's really frustrated with himself there because that was a first and 10 play action they boot him back to the field. He actually had an open receiver there. Did a nice job of making a quick read. Gets it out of his hand. That's a ball typically that Stroud has shown the consistency of being able to make that accurate throw. That's big yards there on first and ten if they hit that one. Stuffed in the backfield. No gain. Javon Kinlaw several seasons with the 49ers is there to stop him with five and a half to go in the third he's playing a lot better than he has recently where he's had some struggles where he gets up high against the run and he just he gets beat and pushed off the line of scrimmage tonight he must like the matchup because he is moving around much better he's shooting the gaps against his offensive line and getting into that backfield, whether it's been a pass rush or against a run. Had a battle back and a lot of injuries. Agunbowale is in the backfield on third and 11. He stays in the block. Look out. Down he goes. So he had McDonald coming in first, and then Sherwood, Jamie and Sherwood, finishes him off. And that's a sack of 11 yards. But McDonald has had such a big year coming in. Eight sacks on the year. He works around Tunsil with quickness. I thought he was going to pull him down with one arm, but instead he forces him to step up. And there's Sherwood who just cleans that up there at the end. So Fairbairn will come in. He missed a 56-yarder. Earlier had the distance, but it was wide. This one from 54 out. on its way and through. So it's 4-11 to play in a rapidly faced game this year. One touchdown. More horrors from the first half. Kirk, go ahead. Yeah, it was a tough first half for the Jets offense. They responded perfectly with the adjustments. Things looked a lot better, but it could not have gone any worse. Even when they played well, the defense with a chance to get a stop on a punt, They roughed the punter. There's the fumble by Corley. Went through the end zone for a touchback. Dropped passes. Just out of sync. You know, even when they had open receivers, dropped balls. So, a little bit of everything. Much of what you've seen these first eight weeks of the season. But an outstanding start to the second half with a patient approach from Aaron Rodgers. The run game, mix in with some quick throws. Starts this one. Play action. Rolling, throwing. and complete intended for Wilson. You know, this has been a house of horrors. And don't forget, ghosts have appeared here. Sam Darnold actually saw some in that game against the Patriots. Oh, that's right. So the Texans come right back with a big-time answer, 50 yards. They show you two tight ends on first and ten, and they've been doing this all night. Play action. You get Stroud away from the pressure. Don't wait until third down when a defensive line He can turn up and crank the pressure on Stroud. Get him outside. And there's the receiver. Who's going to be the guy to step up with the injuries to Nico Collins and Stephon Diggs. And tonight it has been Tank Dell. Tank Dell, five catches, 120 receiving yards. To the outside, Nixon breaking a tackle. Picking up a couple. Nixon has now carried 20 times for 98 yards. Keep this in mind as we get down to crunch time in the fourth quarter. The Jets have struggled all year in one-possession games. They're 1-4 in one-possession games. Meanwhile, on the other side, the Texans, that's been their story. They're 5-1 in these one-possession games. And if you go back over the last couple years, 12-4. So the Texans know how to win these close games. They have under Ryan's. Meanwhile, through the middle this time goes J.J. Taylor. And that'll make it third down. and two. Timeout for injury. And another timeout for an injury. Slow and getting up that time is Isaiah Oliver. And he'll come out for at least one play. With Damian Pierce down tonight, they just picked up J.J. Taylor, brought him in tonight. Right. He's running hard. You know, you need that compliment to Joe Mixon. Pierce when he's healthy is that guy. Taylor 26 done a heck of a job running hard tonight Taylor in New England for a couple of years did not play at all in 0-3 Played his college ball in Arizona Free agent this year Doing a nice job tonight Nixon is back third and one Play safe Stroud dancing, rolling. Can he get the first down? He reaches for it. We'll see where they spot it. Wow, what a play and a gutsy call. Bobby Slowick. He's going to be short. Didn't get the ball in that right hand to be able to extend it. He actually moves it to the last second in the left hand. But Stroud showing it. Tried to bait the defense. Good job of the Jets covering it. Watch it, the right hand. The last second he puts it in the left hand to protect it. And that's what kept him short of the first down. Fourth and inches. And now you've got another medical timeout. When they say that with nobody down on the field, it means the official is taking a player out. That's Oliver, who was out, came back in, and now they're taking him out again. So fourth and issues. Ten and a half left in the fourth. Stroud will go under center. Mixon is the back. Gets it. Head down. First down. To the 12. And you get behind that right side of the offensive line. Shaq Mason, Titus Howard. Pretty good foot. Look at the opening there. They're just expecting the quarterback sneak. And they got away from that interior. Got the ball to the outside. Just trust Joe Mixon with that jump cut, with the vision, the way he's been running all year. Mix in 100 yards now 21 carries He's the back again Has the ball again Taken down to the 11 yard line He almost was able to pull out of there And get that to the back side But Sherwood Who again is in for C.J. Mosley And just such a He's just a You know he looks at Mosley as a mentor for him In the middle of that defense said he practices all the time trying to make sure he gets the checks right and doing his job that time made a great play on that cutback run second and seven oh now they're gonna snap it that comes out to the right and snap it to Nixon. He's just a 19. That's right. I forgot about that. You're up to something else. I know. I've been told before in a booth on Halloween. I'm looking around. I wonder if you and T-Man are up to something. You never know. Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. Second and ten. Little flip here. Holt. Escapes the tackle. And another. and picks up a first down. And he thinks he was not brought down, but rolled on top of a defender and keeps on going. And that's exactly what happened. He's going to put the ball up at the 49-yard line. Toto, who earlier did this exact same thing, where he has his eyes on Hall. He knows he's a dangerous threat out of the backfield. He's there to make the play. He just bounces off of Brees Hall. The replay at first. The ball's down at the 43-yard line at first down. All right, now the replay assist said he was down. Originally they were going to put him up at day 49. There he was. Yeah, down right there. Down there, right. You think of Braylon Allen being a physical back, but Brees Hall at 217 pounds, he just bounced off toe-toe there. Here we go. From the 43, after a 13-yard gain, Paul to the outside taken down at the 48 Neville Hewitt, the middle linebacker making the tackles rolling it down to three minutes remaining in the third quarter The Jets have had some injuries on that offensive line. You actually have four tackles in the game right now Mitchell, Max Mitchell is in right now playing it. He's a right tackle but he's playing left guard and the rookie Fashanu is playing also up there at the right guard spot So rotating and playing with four tackles out of the five spots. To the 50, setting up a third down now. Braylon Allen. So third and three, two and a half left in the quarter. Houston up by three. You know, and when you make a move like that, it's great to have players that have ability and the ability to move from outside to inside. But, boy, it really challenges you on a short week. the communication against a defense that can move around, that's athletic, that's trying to penetrate. So the calls up front and being on the same page, the continuity really going to be tested here for this Jets online. Momentary stoppage. Now they're going to roll the clock, which was at 10 on the play clock. Snap it at one Pass is caught And that's a nice grab that time Wilson able to reach for it But he stops shy of the first down by Petrie So now fourth down And of course the crowd wants them to go for it Rodgers will want them to go for it Everyone's excited Go for it, go for it And if you get stopped, you get booed off the field And the Texans get great field position But of course That's how it works. What have you done for me lately? Allen's in the backfield. He's in that hard count. Trying to get a free first down. That Texan line trying to hold its ground. And they do. And Rodgers will throw and opens Adams for a first down and a lot more. As Devontae Adams gets free. Now he is down. Hopefully he's able to get up What a move So you're going to take some heat Final minute of the quarter Faked the home Rodgers throws Busted up at the lines Second and ten We didn't know if they were going to Third down and short Third down or fourth down and short If he was going to go for it or not He ends up signaling to Adams Gives him that thumbs down And Rodgers so often gives those hand signals, especially to a veteran receiver. What a move, again, by Devontae Adams. That is in his prime kind of move that he makes there against that young corner. And that's, I think, what Jets fans were expecting to see a lot of when Devontae Adams came over from the Raiders to play with his quarterback. Caught 6-9 on 10 targets. To the near side and stopping and making the grab there. was Wilson. He had to fall down to make the catch. Just short here, third and one. Back to Kaylee we go. Guys, Devontae Adams' extremities all seemed to be fine when he was walking up and down the sideline. A staffer came up to him, asked for his helmet, and he's in the blue medical tent with the independent neurologist. So it'll be fourth down. That's really what the Jets defense wants. You're willing to give up a completion, let that clock keep moving, and now you've got a fourth down play. Need two. Has it. Has a lot more inside the 30 and steps out of bounds inside the 25. Now you're in a situation, as we get down to it, you kick the field goal first. You're down 11, so you need a field goal. You need a touchdown. You need a two-point conversion. So that's the choice you have right now. Yeah, and it's one of those things maybe where you take a shot into the end zone, maybe a time or two where you don't waste too much time, and then you come out and kick the field goal. I'm surprised the Jets haven't tried to spy him in these obvious passing situations. I mean, that time he got outside against man coverage. There's just nobody out there. That was big yardage he just picked up there. Harder than ever to get those 11 these days. With a rule change, we have to declare the onside kick. Shroud fires, and that's incomplete. It's broken up there. Sauce Gardner able to get in there to bust it up. It'll be second down and 10. That is a favorable matchup for the Jets. The rookie, Cade Stover, who's a good tight end, but, man, a little push off there. But that length that Gardner has there just kind of eased in coverage. Got his eyes turned, found that football, knocks it away. It's tough to get separation for a tight end against number one. Straight drop. To the end zone. Nothing. Ogunbowale out of the backfield is the intended receiver. Third down and 10 with 1.11 on the clock. Quincy Williams played a good game. You'd expect him to do that with Mosley down. He's been all over the field. Doing a good job in coverage. We've seen him up and run support. How relieved is Devontae Adams? You know, he finally gets a touchdown at a critical moment. In a game where they might have taken him out of the game, he didn't pass the protocol. Third and ten. Rush four again. That's caught. That's a first down. Trying to get out of bounds and does is Robert Woods. So now you're down to 65 seconds. I think you keep plugging away here. You're getting that close to the end zone. Receiver's doing a good job there with Woods getting out of bounds. Saving the clock. You're this close. You've got to put the ball into the end zone. Agreed totally. And if you get into the end zone, you need the two-point conversion. Otherwise, lights out. First down from the 12. to the end zone, too high again 10 for Xavier Hutchinson so exactly 60 seconds, second down and 10 upcoming giving Stroud enough time to be able to step up in the pocket but think about it, these last 4 or 5 plays he's thrown to Stover, Schultz Hutchinson right there, Robert Woods I mean, he's trying to find anybody that can find either an opening against zone or pull a cross on these crossers against man coverage. Rolling, buying time. Guess out of bounds stops the clock after eight seconds. Had gone by. Meanwhile, he got a flag down in a game which has seen 140 yards in penalties. 60 against Houston, 80 against New York. Sean Hockley to tell us. Holding defense number one. The penalties half the distance to the goal added to the end of the play in an automatic first down. It's Gardner. Gardner against Hutchinson. I think it happens well downfield, even into the end zone. Hutchinson trying to kind of get him off with that right arm. But that's where the flag came in right there. Well, they got it down to about the three-yard line here. First and goal. 52 seconds. He's been able to preserve the timeouts, too. Still have two for what that's worth. Need to score. Need to get the two-point conversion. to at least make it somewhat dramatic. Leg down back at the 23. You've got a couple of backup offensive tackles that are playing guard. I think the left tackle, Fashenu, yeah, that's who they got. Rookie out of Penn State. He's in pretty good position, but as Aaron Rodgers, 74, he's got a tough task here. He's all right. He's okay. but when Aaron Rodgers takes off, that's where he grabs onto him. And again, every time Aaron Rodgers, after that injury last year at his age, you just hold your breath, hoping to, that was a pretty good job of working through that, navigating his way to pick up those yards. But obviously it's going to come back with the hold. So it might have been a first and goal becomes a third and 19. four-man rush Rodgers to the end zone and Wilson can he one and stay inbounds They say he was out Out Lasseter covering on the play Almost a catch for the ages. He's going to go for the fifth. The only chance would be the knee if it came down. He has to. Oh, what a catch. Waiting for that other foot. Just doesn't get down. The knee is close. That's what the crowd is reacting to. What a grab, though. One-handed. Oh, my gosh. Ridiculous catch. And the play clock is running. And maybe the shin gets down. Terry, what are they looking at after that initial foot got down when it came right there at the back line? Any other body part other than hand or foot? Well, ten years ago in this ballpark, on the other side of the field, Odell Beckham made one of the great one-handed grabs of all time. And tonight, it doesn't get any better than this. That is as good a catch as you'll see. The left foot, and then Terry, if you want to come in here, they felt the shin got down before the knee went out. Sure, Kirk. This is a great shot. That shin clearly touches inbounds before the knee goes out of bounds. That puts him inbounds with control. Touchdown. Wow. Body control, hands, unbelievable by Garrett Wilson. How about the throw by Aaron Rodgers? And Patterson's extra point is good. A couple of minutes into the fourth quarter. On a catch really for the ages. on a night when the Jets need every break they can possibly get. Perfect. Look at this. Watch Lasseter out. The decision to make this throw is just Aaron Rodgers saying, my guy is better than yours. Look at that coverage, and he still is going to throw this ball, counting on third and long Garrett Wilson to adjust back and make a catch. I don't know if he knew it would be this good. This is as good a catch as you'll ever see for him to get that shin down, The body control, a strength of his, really his entire career going back to college at Ohio State. And the Jets have been waiting during this five-game losing streak for their best players to make the plays at critical moments. And Aaron Rodgers and Garrett Wilson just did that here in the fourth quarter. So Wilson has both touchdowns tonight. Adams being evaluated for a concussion, watching that in the locker room. A penny for his thoughts. Speaking of the, well, we'll get to it in a second from the one-yard line comes Sims. Oh, boy. He gets whacked. Takes it to the 27-yard line. Tackle made there by, I'll tell you, in a second. Meanwhile, this was the catch we were talking about 10 years ago. Beckham made that grab. Crazy. The flag was thrown. It was against the defense. What made that impressive is behind him, right? I mean, I don't even know if he's way back there. And that kind of started a trend all over football where everybody catches in practice in pregame with one hand. Absolutely. That was the forerunner to everybody trying to make that play. And we've seen a few through the years. Stroud rolling. He's throwing deep. He's got a man. He hits him to the 20-yard line. Tank Dill. Get a guy into the action who hasn't seen any action tonight. Nothing here. It's Allen taken down. But Petrie is a physical slot corner. They're able to sit in that nickel no matter what your formation is. D'Amico Ryans believes in him. They moved him from safety down closer to the line of scrimmage this year. no matter what you show up in, he can cover. He's a true hybrid. He can blitz. That time he showed that. Run support guy. Really a physical player at 200 pounds of the ability to cover that slot receiver. Second and 12. Ball in the backfield. Adams wide to the left. Wilson comes out of the slot. Makes the catch. Wilson. stays inbounds. That keeps the clock moving. It'll be third down. Peachtree makes the stop third and three. And a timeout taken here by the Texans. They're first. Two to go plus the two-minute warning. 14-10. Jets. Enders have pressured in five with a sack, and you can see that 51.6 pressure rate. It'll be the second highest in Stroud's career. Remember last year when he came into this game, He got pressured a bunch against his same defense. Had a bad day. Concussion missed the next two games. Jets have seven sacks tonight. Ran to Marty Lyons before the game. Speaking of the sack exchange. Yeah. So third and three. Again, in that situation where if they pick up a first down, you're compelling the Texans to take their at least one timeout. You got the two-minute warning. Clock and stop three times. But a big, big stop for the Texans coming here. Aaron Rodgers' eyes there. You see him talking there. Gave Mike Williams some extra instructions. Extra pressure. Going deep. Has his man. Has Adams. Touchdown. Devontae Adams out of concussion protocol and into the end zone. Now we know he's telling Mike Williams, stay up tight. Make sure you give Devontae enough room to work on that slot fade against straight-up man coverage against Petrie. Patterson Point after is good 21-10 Adams with his first touchdown as a New York Jet At 68 in Green Bay With number 8 Remember he hit him on a 4th and 1 on that stuttering go This time he gets Petrie one-on-one Petrie loses balance there. Makes it easy for Adams. But I don't think he's going to be able to stay with him. Bear Rogers is exactly what he wanted. The coverage that he wanted. And there's the rhythm. There they are. 8-17. The way the Jets fans had hoped when they caught him. Used to be 12-17. That's right. When he came over here. I can't take name this number, right? He changed up. Adams stays the same. So they're checking him out for a concussion after he went down out of bounds earlier in the quarter. Passed it. Catches this one. And tonight, 91 yards for him, 90 for Wilson. Rodgers now at 2-11 after a terrible first half. And the Jets lead by 11. for this second half you start to visualize what this Jets offense instead of the potential of it you see the reality of what it can be these next eight weeks three touchdowns on three drives here Sims to the 30 and just a few minutes ago not much sweeter than this considering the circumstances of this team needing a win. Desperately. Out of the darkness and into the light, ladies and gentlemen, in the second half. Three drives, three touchdowns. Now Stroud having a rough night tonight. Stroud throwing deep. Look at the monitors. Out right now as the quarter winds down. 39 up, and going 19! Third and one, look out, Paul breaks a tackle in the backfield, and then gets stopped short of the line to gain. And that's going to take us to the fourth, and going to take us to whether they go for it, or kick a game-time field goal. End to three. Shree Kaylee Hartung with you. Producer Mark Teitelman, director Pierre Moussa. Very interesting decision here. Meanwhile, there is Adams, who was in the blue tent. So he's on the sideline. There's Anderson. He's been in and out, but mainly out. You can tie the game with a 40-yard field goal or go for it on a fourth down and one. They already made a fourth down on this drive. Braylon Allen is the back. Rodgers comes up in the pistol. Retreats. surveys under pressure nearly gets sacked there was a wobbly pass that could have been intercepted but wasn't flag is thrown yet Farakashi coming in there's a flag down at the 15 yard line Sean Hockley getting his cue from the other officials. Rodgers wants to know what's going on. Obviously. And so... The quarterback left the pocket. Illegal contact. Defense on the turn. Wow, that's on Stingley. So instead of turning it over on downs, they call Stingley for the foul and an automatic first. He's up against Mike Williams, the veteran and press man coverage. Hands, hands, hands. Just grabbing. And you heard him say before he left the pocket. Yeah. Well, we've seen worse, haven't we? Yeah. From the 17-yard line. On first down, rolling, throwing. That's caught and stopped at the 12-yard line. is Jeremy Rucker. Meanwhile, a Devontae update. Caitlin, what do you know? The Jets just confirmed to me that Devontae Adams is being evaluated for a concussion in the locker room. Okay. We thought it might have been the shoulder. Down he went, being evaluated for a concussion. Meanwhile, this drive, here comes the 11th play of this drive. Their last drive went 11 plays and resulted in a touchdown. So second down and six. Three receivers including Wilson to the left They go that way and the tackle is made there Beautifully read, taken down, no chance Petrie is right there, Conklin is taken down And now you got another injured Texan here Time out for injury it appears to be Petrie in on the play there he is Mike Williams here you got two guys going out to block one nobody picks up Petrie and the result is a loss and a little bit of friendly fire coming in at the end But here comes. Al, let's take a peek just one more time. It's such a big call. You know, you've got five yards. This is the fourth and one. This is five yards where Stingley can work him, work him. Now, at this point, he can touch him. I just, that is a, that's a gray area. I mean, that call could go one way or the other. I mean, it goes in favor of the Jets. But that, I thought he let go after that five-yard mark. Well, they saw it the other way. Now you've got, after the injury timeout of third and nine, a little over a minute into the fourth quarter, Texans are up by three. Remember, Adams is in the locker room being looked at. So they send everybody out here. Here you go five wide. Here's Garrett Wilson. That hole split out to the left. Rodgers looked that way now over the middle now he's going to take off and he's going to get the first down flag down though he's at the three but this is a full kinds of action going on downfield but all incidental incomplete intended for Hutchinson covered by Jalen Mills second and ten yeah we've talked a lot about it with with digs down for the rest of the year with the ACL and Nicole Collins you get into these obvious passing situations it's just such a Such a different challenge for Stroud. The protection, not having his two main targets. This is what the Jets hope to do early in this game is jump up on him to allow the defense to get after him and be able to put pressure on these receivers with tight coverage. Chased again. Deep down field. and it's too deep and incomplete. You've got three black shirts around Dolphin Schultz, third and ten. The Jets doing a good job sitting back with two safeties. Their whole goal here is just keep everything in front of them, even off those scramble plays. Willing to give up completions underneath, but with its 11-point lead, 2.33 to go, just don't give up the easy score. 18 pressures, 7 sacks. Under duress all night. Time out. Delay a game. That's better than a time out at this point. You got two left. You got the two-minute warning. Of course, it costs you five yards. and makes it third and 15. Again, the standings of Texans. Two-game lead plus the tiebreaker. Jags and Titans far behind. Bills on top. Big lead there. Three and a half games over the Dolphins. Four over the Pats. And the Jets trying to scramble back into the race. Wild card anyway. Third and 15. Stroud. Throws that's caught, but well short of the first and stays inbounds on top of it to poop. Tank Dell taken down there. So it's fourth and nine. Racing up to the line. Have to go for it. Trying to get it in before the two-minute warning. Needs nine. Gets none. Flag, however. it's on Isaiah Oliver sitting back in zone and he just blows the play up Tank Dale didn't have a chance to make a play on the football by the defense number 23 the ball will be placed at the spot of the foul it's first down and a mini break here they're down by 11 but you know you'll take anything you can get so one second before the two minute warning You don't get to the two-minute warning. You still have three clock stoppages, counting the two-minute break. So first down at the 43-yard line. Stroud tonight, 9 of 22. For a man who's been very accurate for the most part over the past two seasons. Not tonight. Too much pressure. Four-man rush. gets it away down the sideline. Can he make the catch inbounds? The officials look at each other, and they go what? They go no. No. It looks like one thought he had both feet down the other. Winning Wednesdays. Meanwhile, second down and 10 with 155. Shot fires, and had the man but couldn't hit him. That's Tank Dell incomplete. Third and ten. Again, tight window there. Line does a good enough job to give him a chance. It was a route that took time to be able to work across. He had him, but, again, it would have had to have been a perfect throw. Jets doing a pretty good job. Just rushing for Quentin Williams, Son Redick, Will McDonald. third and 10 with 149 extra protection in the backfield then they flare out Travis Chase fires caught it with 50 and stops short of the first down is Dalton amazing things go one way then they go the other then they come back to the other That kind of night, 6 for a round. From the 20, the Jets now. A little toss back here. Ball, looking for some space. Tackled inbounds up to the 22-yard line. So here you are, 6.40 to go in a game, up four, have the football, lost five in a row. Your quarterback Aaron Rodgers thinks if they can get a win tonight, you can start to look at that schedule and start to get positive. but now the ball's in your court, Aaron and the Jets. You got the lead. This is a big drive. This is an opportunity to turn this season around by trying to finish this game off. I don't think he'd love better than a clock-eating drive at this point, too. Second and eight. To the outside. Nice move. First down. Reese Hall. Tackled by Lassiter. So he is carried as hole 14 times for 70 yards. Five yards per carry. This kid, you know, we just talked about how bad do you want this right now. Good job. A little bit of penetration. He works around Derek Barnett. Bounces off a tackler, which would have been Hewitt. First down. Aaron Rodgers knows how big that one was. And stays in bounds. and nobody works that clock better than number eight. Taking that play clock down inside five. Shooing up the game clock, five and a half. As Wilson, he's trying to stay in and he does. Lassiter makes that tackle. Just keep in mind, you've got the backup tackles, Max Mitchell and Faschenu in playing guard. You've got Devontae Adams in the locker room after he went down with an injury. So Lazard's not playing tonight. So this team's getting backed up into a corner on a short week, and they got a four-point lead, and they're just trying to find a couple plays here to win this football game. And the Texans, meanwhile, are saying, we don't care about your problems. We got our own. Second and five. Hall again. Going to be a third down and two now at the 43. Bok will be down almost four. Here comes Adams. And Devontae obviously passing the concussion protocol. And back out there. Got the big back in there, Craven Allen. Big play here. You can start to make Houston use its timeouts. Then you get another first down here. Third and one. Trying to get him to jump. And they take a timeout instead with exactly four minutes to play in regulation. Their first of the half, 30-second timeout. Again, let's set what this means for Houston. They've got a nice pad here. Two-game lead, plus they own the tiebreaker over Indianapolis, beating them twice. But for the Jets, I mean, Buffalo looks like they're going to win the division. But, you know, ever since they went to seven in a conference in the wild card, they're not dead yet. You look at who they have left that we said in the open. They have one team, Buffalo, left that has a winning record. Everybody else is 500 or below. And this was the pivotal swing game for them. The season was going to go one way or the other. And here it is. It's He's here for the taking. And as you pointed out at the top, only one team on the remaining schedule at the moment is over 500. Yep. And Aaron's saying, hey, you know, we go to Arizona. We play Indianapolis. We have a bye. We meet Seattle. Who knows? Meanwhile, a very big third and one. Rodgers. Throwing. Completing. Gets the first down. and the opponent makes his first target, his first catch of the night and the only thing is it stops the clock if nothing else but now Houston has to begin to think about using timeouts because it's first and 10 with 3.55 and 11 yard gain here. How about the call here by Todd Downing? You know, you think with the big back you go the safe way and try to get behind the line and get the yards that you need instead he pulls it out. he had Adams. I thought he might throw it a little further downfield, but instead takes the short throw underneath for the first down yards they needed. Maddock at the end. Surveying. Look out. Fires incomplete. Mugumbo Wally is there, so that took another five seconds off the clock. 47 to go. There's Gardner. So he'll have to come out for at least a play. Man, how many end-of-game injuries are we seeing these days? New York has charged a timeout for an injury inside two minutes. He's just trying to stay up with Stephen Sims. Again, we keep talking about these crossing routes. That's what Sims was trying to do. And he's already, it looks like he's already feeling something. The change of direction. So you have the 14th play of a drive coming. Texans have run 74 plays tonight. And the Jets have run 54. So Gardner out. Brandon Echols comes in. He's been in and out tonight. You've got three receivers off to the left. Two to the right. Look out. Stroud gets taken down at the 15-yard line. Hassan Redick coming in. Williams is also there in the neighborhood, and that is eight sacks tonight. And Houston takes a timeout. Well, this is what Redick, this is what he's supposed to do in these situations where you can get him home without having to necessarily blitz. And he's got that ability to win against Howard. Just forced him to step up. As you mentioned, Quentin Williams and Redick both able to come up. But just the ability to make the quarterback feel that pressure, and then you get to push in the interior. There's nowhere to go. That was really the key tonight. You knew the edge pressure would be there. It was where they're going to get to push with Quentin Williams and Ken Long Company. So Fairbairn tonight has missed two field goals. Third time that's happened. So trying to make it an eight-point game, onside kick would come after that if he makes it, which he does. So it's 21-13. And now you declare the onside kick and say a small prayer. And we can tell you right after the game, of course, as usual. It's our gang. Our gang. None like it either. Kaylee interviewing the star of the game. You got Wilson's heroics lifting the Jets, Mixon leading the Texans offense. And the gang is all there. They'll be back at the hotel probably at around 3 o'clock. Yeah, of course. Quite a night on the other side for Aaron Rodgers, considering we were talking about the first half, one of the worst he's had as far as production is concerned in his entire career. He ends up 22-32 at 2-11, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Numbers look good. So only 9% of the onside kicks, one out of 11, are recovered by the team kicking. Of course, then you need to recover it. You need to get a touchdown. you need to get a two-point conversion. They've got Devontae Adams out there. They've got Garrett Wilson out there. You've got the hands team, which normally comes in in situations like this. And the bouncing ball will be stopped by Adams. So there it is. He, in effect, will seal it. Houston can stop it with one more timeout, and that will take the Jets to the end of a five-game losing streak. 38 seconds, thank you. So they start out 2-1. Looked good. Rodgers had a big night. Ulbricht's going to get his first victory as the interim head coach, already accepting the congratulations. How about Aaron Rodgers telling us on our call this week, he said, man, I just can't wait to hand him that game ball on his first win. He's going to get that chance tonight. There it is, and there's that schedule. They've got ending in a week and a half. They've got a bye. They've got Seattle coming in at Miami. You got Jacksonville. Rodgers will take a knee. And the Texans will be content to let that clock run out. Yep, we talked to him this week. I mean, Aaron is very smart. I mean, obviously, whatever you think of him, he's a polarizing figure. We know that. But he's going to take it. He's going to throw it and overthrows Stroud, who's looking for a flag. There is none. So they go to the back of the playbook. Mixon threw a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl against the Rams. No stranger. The hurling one. Stroud came up because I think he thought Reed grabbed onto his arm. Pretty good effort here by Mixon. Of course, a threat to run. The whole defense comes up to stop him except for Reed who's out there one-on-one. Stroud now has a different perspective. He's usually throwing when guys are grabbing onto arms. Now he felt it himself. Either way goal. Third and seven. Stroud. Taken all the way back to the 27 by Michael Clemens. I've been bragging about Kendrick Green at left guard. and the job he has done stepping up for Kenyon Green. And this time he gets overmatched by Clemens. Used to seeing Quentin Williams make that play, but it's Michael Clemens this time who uses a great move right at the line of scrimmage with quickness and power and then finishes it off as Stroud tried to escape. What a play. 15-yard shot. That turns this into a 43-yard field goal instead of a chip shot to make it a one-point game. Bear Baron. Boots it through. So with 8-19 with another flag. Another one came in. Yeah. Sean Hockley. Getting the info. Answer is. Personal foul. Unnecessary roughness. Contacted a snapper. by the defense. The penalty is half the distance to the goal in an automatic first down. Whoa, baby. I think it's Eric Watts now 58. Rookie out of UConn. He's lined up right here. Up in the air. He drives his leg right into the snapper's head. And that's why they made the call, which is the right call. Yep, so the flag come up immediately. Half the distance puts him at the 12-yard line. And a first down. Hounds up! Nixon stays on his feet gets to the 10 second down let's see if the Texans can capitalize on this opportunity another miscue for the Jets on special teams remember they roughed the punter earlier in the first half and now roughing the snapper which you don't see very often but the right call gives C.J. Stroud after that sack second life here. Chance to finish his drive off late in his game. Down four. Stucked again. Gained to maybe one. Mixon. Take it down that time. Leonard Taylor. She got a third down and seven. That defensive line and linebackers. Great shot. Jalen Mills getting down there helping out. And imagine how they felt running off the field. They get a big stop on the sack by Clemens, and then they've got to come back out. And they have stepped up here on these first two plays. Some crazy stuff on Halloween night. Third and seven. Four-man rush. Stroud. Fires. No good. Mechie was the intended receiver that time. The coverage is very good. Stroud couldn't connect. Stroud is now 8 of 19. Stroud worked from the left and then came back, thanks to the offensive line giving him enough time. And Mechie sees him back there. He's kind of out of the route, and then he comes back, works back underneath where he is open. He actually pulled away from the defender and had a chance there. He's in the end zone. That's a touchdown. He sets that ring for a field goal here. 27-yard attempt. Townsend puts it down. Bear Baron hits the upright.
