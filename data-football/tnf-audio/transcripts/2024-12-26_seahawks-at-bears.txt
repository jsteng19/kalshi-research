 As we start the second quarter, Al Michaels, Kirk, Curve Street, and Kaley Harton, we start here with a run, a one-yard run on a second and five, make it third down and four. Just looking at a note, since 1985, the Super Bowl shuffle season, the Bears have finished below .500, you probably already know this, you and Georgie, 21 of 38 seasons under .500. Well, they've had only one winning season in the last 12. Third and four. Good blocking up front. Pass caught. Nice dance move. Jackson Smith and Jicka takes it up to the 30-yard line for the first down. Nice job by Charbonnet. Watch 26 right here picking up this blitz. They pressure up the middle. Need a block. Bang. There it is. Geno Smith, good job of surveying that coverage. This time, with the protection, he's able to find Jackson Smith and Jigba. Almost went over the middle. Held on to the football. And then locates 11 off to his left there for the first down. Hey, low, low, low, low. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. Over the right side. five yard gain here Charbonne you know come at that that one season 2018 their only winning season in the last 12 Matt Nagy is the coach that season ended with the double doink in the playoffs right the ignominious double doink little draw play here Charbonne to the 44 yard line he goes how much fun again is this guy to run. Abraham Lucas, the right tackle. Good to see him back healthy. Came back the last few weeks. Both their tackles at the bottom here. Watch 72 pull around. Look at this offensive line. This line, again, they're not able to really sustain blocks this time. They are able to. It opens up for Lucas to come around and Charbonnet running with an attitude tonight with this opportunity. Six first downs for Seattle, only one for Chicago. Smith. Fires, caught on the Chicago side of the field. That's called in by Tyler Lockett. Still doing his thing ten years in the league. Picked him in the third round. His dad, Kevin, had a great career as a Kansas City Chief. Yeah, he goes right at Jalen Johnson. Not a lot of people do this. He's able to sell that downfield. and then come back to the football. Number one does not get tested very often on that side of this defense, but a nice job between the nickel there. Gordon and the corner, Johnson found that opening, and Geno again put it right on the money. Smith, six out of nine, now seven out of ten to the 39-yard line. Goes Tyler Lockett, back-to-back to him. Gain of a couple, second and eight. Think of these weapons when they're all healthy. The year that Jackson Smith and Jigba's had over 1,000 yards, we all know what DK Metcalf can do when he's healthy. He's battled through some stuff this year. Tyler Lockett throwing Noah Fant, this rookie tight end out of Michigan, A.J. Barner. Now you see in the backfield with Charbonnet when Kenneth Walker is healthy. That's not a bad group to work with around Geno Smith. Second and seven. Put Lockett in motion. Low snap, handled well. Under pressure, spun down the 42-yard line. Byron Howard takes him down there. Lost a couple on the play, but lost a four, third down, four and 11. They gave him enough time with the coverage. They're sitting back in zone. Watch the second level with Tremaine Edwards and T.J. Edwards, 53 and 49. Just kind of taken away anywhere underneath. And by the time he's able to try to find his check down, the pressure is able to get in there. There's the two linebackers kind of squeeze in there. There's nowhere to go with the football. Sack for Cowart. Third and ten is a flag. Haven't seen that all night. And T.J. Edwards put the pressure on. So, I forgot who was reffing tonight's game. Scott Novak. You'll hear from him in a second. We like games like that. We sure do. Offside. On the offense number 11. He lined up offside. And he declined. 4-th down. Smith and Jigler. So it's 4-th down. Let's take a look at our defensive alerts. This is Martin. 55. Got a hold of it. and we'll see if Seattle can take the lead now with a long field goal. Yeah, he does a good job getting his arms up. You know, we've seen on this drive Geno Smith making a few plays with his legs to keep some plays alive. He had DK Metcalf, this time from the pocket. Martin, great job at timing that up to knock it down. So a 50-yard field goal attempt right now. Jason Myers. Michael Dixon to hold it. to give Seattle the lead, which he does. 35-20. 6-3 Seahawks, and we'll be back with you in 30 seconds. The facility is one very close to Soldier Field. They would not remodel it as, my understanding, would be a brand-new stadium. To be determined, but they hope to be into whatever the new facility is by 2028. They remodeled just, what, 10 or 15? Well, right around 20, 2002 or so, I think. Okay. Did the first game here after the remodeling in 2002 or so. They played in Champaign, Illinois for two seasons. That was very interesting. Did you do a game while they were in Champaign? Did a Monday night game there with Dress Bar and the company. You've been there a few times. I have. in your career. Pretty windy. Oh, yeah. So 21 seconds. Chicago will get the ball to start the second half. Rain coming down. Temperature right now is 42. There are the numbers so far. Williams 7 out of 13 for 82 yards. Swift. Spinning. up to the 37-yard line, and Chicago will stop the clock here. Timeout number two, Chicago. Once again, we're reminded last week, these last 15 seconds or so, remember we thought Sean Payton and the Broncos would just go in at half and be comfortable with the lead. Yep. Threw a couple passes, one incomplete, stopped the clock, and then Harbaugh ended up calling a timeout on the next play, And, of course, we ended up having a free kick after the penalty on the punt. Wasn't that unusual? It happens every 48 years. Yeah, exactly. That's just crazy. Oh! You got it? Oh! Oh! Oh! Second and three. Can they get into field goal range? Williams dancing, looking. He's going to get sacked at the 30-yard line by Leonard Williams. His great season continues, and that's three sacks and 63 sacks for the season of Caleb Williams. Halftime, it is Seattle 6, Chicago 3. in the rain. What a show of this organization or other organizations that they're guys that can be contributors next year. So you've got to put good film up. From the one-yard line, here's the run back. And stumbling and finally throwing down the 22 is Tyler Scott. No one should go. Kaylee with Thomas Brown. Well, Thomas, what adjustments will you make to stop the Seahawks' running game? Well, to me, it's really simple. So have gap integrity, get off a block, and have population to the football. You're down three points, not three scores. What do you want to see Caleb Williams and his offense do differently? Communicate properly in and out of the huddle. So we'd be great with our motion time, our motion technique, but also stop shooting ourselves in the foot. Thank you. All right, thank you, Kennedy, from the 22-yard line. The Beards will start this drive. Williams, play action, chased, and he'll step out of bounds. first half by Witherspoon after a short game. Yeah, great coverage there. That's a levels concept. They like to get him out on the edge where he is so dangerous as a passer. And like I said, I mean, as athletic as he is, once he gets out there, he is looking to find an open target. I think you and I both were really impressed with Thomas Brown this week. And I know Kaylee was as well. Our time visiting with him, he's in a very tough position. came over to be a passing game coordinator from Carolina. Halfway through the year, he's calling plays. A few weeks after that, he's interim head coach. Yeah, apart from that, nothing much for him. He'll out to the 30-up. It's an interesting thing. We were talking to him the other day. So, Ivor Flues gets fired today after Thanksgiving, that disaster with the clock in Detroit. So he starts as the run or the pass game coordinator, and he's the offensive coordinator. So he gets the job. He gets the job on that Friday, but they have the long weekend, the mini-bye. Went to the powers that be after they give him the job. He said, do I have anything to do over the next two or three days? No. So I want to go home. He's got three kids at home in Charlotte. Makes his home in Charlotte. Family still. He said he was able to clear his head, get ready for the press conference on Monday. Meanwhile, Roshan Johnson. Nowhere to go. No. They were stoned at the line of scrimmage. Jaron Reed and company. The WUSU. You can hear the crowd's not real excited. Even the rookie, Byron Murphy. Young man out of Texas, 91. But watch Jaron Reed, Leonard Williams. That's a difficult three to move off the spot. You got Witherspoon getting in there. Love getting in there. There's no push at all on that third and short. So on fourth and one, Taylor comes in to punt. Jalen Darden is back to receive it. Darden calls for the fair catch at the 20-yard line. Well, Seattle working with this three-point lead, but what I found interesting in that first half is Geno Smith really not throwing the ball downfield much at all, other than when he scrambled and found some receivers. He's 7 of 7 behind the line of scrimmage, And his average air yards per throw, 2.1. 2.1. That's the fewest in a game since he has joined the Seahawks. So definitely not getting the ball downfield in that first half against the Chicago defense. Rain coming down steadily right now. Not heavily, but steadily from the 20-yard line. Seattle's first offensive play of the second half is play action Smith steps away caught, six yard gain Jack Charbonnet having a nice night Charbonnet on the ground is 50 yards and through the air 17 receiving yards Nice to see him again running the football and when you run the football obviously you can work the play action a little bit more and just check it down after faking to him. Get some positive yards here on first and 10. Come up without a huddle on second down and four. Inside handoff. Nothing happening that time. The Bears swarmed him at the line of scrimmage led by Demarcus Walker. Third and five. He does a really good job here setting this edge. Buluat Timmy, the center, pulls around to try to kick him out. There's 51, but showing that strength. Again, often we look at these guys on the edge, and we talk always about their ability to rush the quarterback. But as you see right there, that's a big role in something that DeMarcus Walker is very good at. Nice job of getting off that block and forcing that ball back inside. on third and five. Four-man rush. Stepping up, stepping out. Smith, bad knee and all, out to the 44-yard line for a first down. A lot of Chicago defenders just kind of standing around watching. Nobody making a tackle, especially the linebackers at that second level. They're worried about who they're covering, but once he gets out, nobody really getting on their horse to make a play. I'm surprised, and I know that knee's bothering him, but if he would have kept his feet here, he could have gotten another five or ten yards for sure. Good job there scrambling and finding that first down marker. Started that slide at the 41. First down from that spot. Charbonnet. Second down and long now. T.J. Edwards making the tackle. Well, you know, the Chicago Bears, of course, Thomas Brown will probably get interviewed for the full-time position. I mean, they would all, but all kinds of names are now resurfacing, including Pete Carroll's name is now in the mix. Yeah, quite a bit. How valid that is, I don't know what this name is. Right. But I wouldn't be surprised if Pete wanted the job or a job. What is it, 72 playing about 52? Right. As far as he's going to see where his career can go. But the physical ability is what I think everybody is so excited to see where his career could end up. Just at Allen for a short game. Under pressure again. He's going to get swarmed and sacked. Back at the 25-yard line. So you have Love and Reed, both exultant. Sharing in the glory, fourth and 20. And this is this defensive line that Mike McDonald told us, I don't think I would take another defensive line in the entire NFL over what I have. Now, they blitzed. They brought some pressure from the safety and love, but it gives you an idea. And there's Williams again in his defense. There's nobody open. And there was no check down. There's just nobody open. He's a guy that's been able to rely on his legs his entire career. And up here, he just can't do that. 64th time he's been sacked this year. Tops in the league. Taylor's punt is going to bounce. And be downed at the 35-yard line with four and a half to go in the third quarter. Seattle six, Chicago three. Well, dysfunction. Unbelievable. Compare that to like the Pittsburgh Steelers. Right. It's tough to win when you don't have that continuity and stability on the staff. From the 35-yard line. Under pressure. Smith thrown off his back foot and incomplete. Smith and Jigler, the intended receiver. So, Smith is an 11 of 17 for just 103 yards. Spares defense, the back end, considering these receivers, the potential, the big play threat. D.K. Metcalf, Jackson Smith and Jigler, the big year he's enjoyed. Tyler Lockett, Fant, really as a group. We talked earlier how dangerous they are. But for the most part, doing a nice job of mixing up coverages and taking away the easy throw. Two-yard gain. Kenny McIntosh. Third down. Among other things, Geno tonight, Smith. Over 4,000 passing yards this season. Third most in the league. Only Joe Burrow and Jared Goff have thrown for more. Well, if you're in the league, remember, you know, got off to a stuttering start in his career. Jets and the Giants played with the Chargers for a while. But he really found a home in Seattle about two or three years ago. Yeah. Of course, that was after Seattle parted ways with Russell Wilson. Third and seven. Fired over the middle. Into traffic. Catches May. Smith and Jigman then loses the ball. But they're going to say he was down. So they retain possession. He was down. Down by contact. Just about to say the location of this football. And here let's see, make sure he is down before that ball comes out. Yeah, definitely down the elbow. But look at this route. Third down. Can the line give him time? And watch the location of this ball. He works back to the football, catches it with his hands, has strengthened his hands when he was working back and picked up that first down. 19-yard gain. Here's a flag. McIntosh to the 39. It's going to be a false start on Seattle. Legal formation on the offense. Number 72 was uncovered. It's a five-yard penalty. Or a reasonable facsimile thereof. same thing what you said yeah right it's a five yard penalty first and 15. you know i think jackson smith and jigba really has a chance to be special for this offense taking some of the you know dk metcalf still because of his threat downfield a lot of times will take safeties with him it opens up the middle of this field and i think that's a big part of the reason we've seen jackson smith and Jigba along with Noah Fant hit big opportunities. First and 15. And about a seven-yard game. You know, we were talking about, we'll go to Kaylee first, and we'll talk about what we were talking about. Kaylee. I think I'm jumping right into that conversation now. Come on, Kaylee. The conversation all Bears fans want to hear about the future of this organization. And Jalen Johnson went so far as to name names when I asked him what he's looking for in a new head coach. He said he wants an offensive guy in the role to give Williams stability as he grows, and he proceeded to name Ben Johnson, Cliff Kingsbury, Joe Brady, coaches he called masterminds. But he also said this team needs a leader of men, like maybe a Mike Grable. He said they're all good candidates who bring something different to the table, but candidly, he said he feels like there's no right answer. Well, that's Farrell Brown making that. So Seahawks will get the ball. Tyro Santos to kick off and Kenny McIntosh is back to receive along with Derrick Young. McIntosh will be the number two running back tonight with Kenny Walker inactive. And the kick will go through the end zone for the touchback. So here come the Seahawks. They've been pass heavy this season. Geno Smith, his numbers, the completion percentage is very good. 63 more yards and he'll get to the 4,000 mark. He is third in the league in yardage behind Burrow and Goff. But he's thrown 15 picks and only Kirk Cousins has thrown more. Fogg rolling into Soldier Field, which is nothing new. They had that great Fogg Bowl game, that memorable game on New Year's Eve. The playoff game against Philadelphia back in 88. it's funny because it's so clear about 300 yards away but here we go Zach Charbonnet is the running back on our first down a quick pass to the outside and that is caught by Tyler Lockett the 11 year veteran gain of 3 it'll be second down and 7 the youngest coach in the league is the Seattle rookie coach Mike McDonald there he is the second youngest is Thomas Brown is the interim head coach in Chicago And Sean McVay couldn't hold that mantle forever. He had it for a lot of years. But now McDonald is the youngest guy in the league. Yeah, 37 years old. He spent a lot of time with Baltimore. There's Thomas Brown, who's become the interim head coach. Spent a little time in L.A. himself. Assistant head coach to Sean McVay during their Super Bowl run a couple of years ago. Meanwhile, nice move here and a little short of the first down. And Charbonnet gets out to the 29-yard line. And it will be third down and one. It's interesting with Chino Smith this year. You mentioned the interceptions. They have a new offensive coordinator, obviously, with a new head coach, Ryan Grubb, who came over from the University of Washington, able to stay in town after the great year the Huskies had and not been able to run the football. They're 30th out of 32 teams. And it's been more about what's happening up front with the offensive line. and see what this line does here in this third and short. Run it again, pick up the first down. Charbonnet ended his college career at UCLA after starting at Michigan. First down for the Hawks. And I think when you can't run the football, one of the things Geno Smith, since he's taken over for Russell Wilson these last three years, really been good at run the football and set up play action. Well, this year he's been backing that shotgun without the ability to run. The ball has put a lot on him, the offensive line, and these receivers to produce through the air. He's been pressured quite a bit. 12th in the league. DK Metcalf set wide to the right. Now they bring him inside, put Lockett outside. They stack the two and keep it on the ground with an inside handoff. And Charbonnet with some tough running and picks up the first down. Finally tackled by Kevin Bayard. Good block there by LaMaea, the rookie right guard, 11-yard pickup. Yeah, LaMaea right here. Watch him pull around and actually does a nice job of opening this up with that pressure from the edge. But I'll tell you, Charbonnet, not well-known around the league. This guy can play very physical. You lose the home run threat without Kenneth Walker in, but Charbonnet can catch the ball to the backfield. You saw there how elusive he can be and how physical he can be as a bat. fake it to him, pass to the outside, that's Noah Fant. And a good start, good opening drive for the Seahawks as Fant takes it to the 44-yard line. Tyreek Stevenson makes the stop, that's again a 14. And nice job of feeling again this pressure once again from the outside. Jacob Martin's bringing his same thing he did on the previous play. Now watch the block right here. Jackson Smith and Jigman knows they're getting the ball out. He's had such a big year catching the ball, but how about the blocking there? That time to open it up, along with Tyler Lockett also making a nice block. So quick execution there by Geno Smith to get the ball at the fan, who can do a lot of damage after the catch. So three straight first downs and then tripped up as he crosses the line. This time it is Kenny McIntyre. Again, their number one back, Walker, not only inactive tonight, but on injured reserve. Now Darrell Taylor made that last stop. Game here of two. It'll be second down and eight on the opening drive. And just on this opening drive, you know, you can feel a rhythm. Keep in mind, Seattle was not scored on the opening drive with a touchdown in the last 19 games. It's the longest current drought in the NFL. They are off to a pretty good start here as they take this opening kick, moving the ball well. Putting that pressure from the outside and squeezing him in, not giving him any room to step up and then get out. That's exactly what they did with great coverage downfield. Leonard Williams again got in there. Third and ten. Extra pressure. Flag. And then that is caught by Adunze for the touchdown. Ending the call here. Holding. Offensive at 73. That's a 10-minute interview. Jake Curran who's starting that left guard in place of Kevin Jenkins who is inactive tonight and that cost him a touchdown yeah a little blitz from the outside moving to his inside it a move by Ernest Jones He was lined up over his outside shoulder and then worked back over across from him like that That's what got him to lose his leverage, and then he's forced to lock him up. Good call by the official right on top of it. And again, that gives you the idea. This guy's rolling to his left, gets his body turned, and throws a seed to the end zone for what would have been a touchdown. Third and 20. Set up a screen. Swift. But Swift taken down right away by William Mafe. For fourth down and long, and they'll try to tie the game with a field goal. Yeah, much better job. These screens, especially the outside screens to D.J. Moore, have been really hurting the Seattle defense. And that time, Mafe is able to chase that one down from behind. Good job of using his vision there to expect that one. Carlos Santos lining it up. Ball placed down to 32. 42-yard attempt. Corey Taylor to hold it. And Santos to boot it. Right down Michigan Avenue. So close by. Anyway, 3-3. I know Malibu Kelly wasn't there with you. No, he wasn't for that. Okay. Was he George? George was not there. We had Jackie Stewart, Sam Pelosi, Chris O'Connor. I knew you did Indy 500. I didn't know you did that. A bunch of stuff. What do you think you haven't done? Soccer. Okay. Good for you. That'd be tough. It's not over yet. All right. Let's look at the stakes again. Seahawks win the division with a win tonight and a Rams loss. We're tied against the Cardinals Saturday and then beat the Rams. When the Rams win the division title, the Seahawks lose or tie tonight. And they beat the Cardinals on Saturday. They could wrap it up before the Rams meet Seattle in Los Angeles in that last game of the season. Be careful next week with the cards. Never know. Cardinals. You can give the Rams a battle. That'll be a good one. For sure. Two and a half to go. Ball at the 30-yard line. Smith hands it off. Nice run here. Nine-yard pickup for Charbonnet, who's now carried eight times for 49 yards in the half. Yeah, he and McIntosh hopefully got a penalty well after the whistle. D.K. Metcalf. Well, you got Metcalf. You got a flag, and Metcalf gets into it. It was he and Tyreek Stevenson initially. Yeah, and then I think DeMarcus Walker, I think, came into the fray. I think they're going to get, initially, DK Metcalf. He slammed his helmet into the face mask of Stevenson after they were jawing back and forth. Let's see if we can discern it. A little bit of pushing and shoving. And then here comes the head right here. Bang. That's when the flag came in. almost always the second man in. What Steven said, ever since the game with the commanders, with the Hail Mary, has not been the same guy. Both against the offense, both against number 14. One score for my conduct. Only one will be enforced. It'll be 15-yard penalty. The down counts. Second down, and that's 14's first score just off the bases. So all on Metcalf. Well, let's see if they can recover from that. After the run by Charbonnet, they're thinking about, hey, we've got a really good shot of getting in the field goal ring. Still plenty of time, but you just hate to see one of your veterans, one of your leaders lose his cool like that, and now you're behind the sticks here. They sit him down for a play or two. Eyes across the front, interior and off the edge. Shows a lot. Can drop. Can get pressure a lot of times just with four. They were going to go quick, then they re-huddled. Got a couple of changes in there. Hangs in the pocket, throws this incomplete. Up at the 45-yard line, Adunze, Roma Adunze. Rookie out of Washington, where he played there with Michael Penix. Made his debut with Atlanta last week, and it's a quick three and out. Yeah, it's just good to see Adunze back in this lineup for Seattle. Has the thigh injury most of the year, and now a wrist. But the pressure there just got too much into the face right at the last second there. The pressure was too much for him to be able to throw an accurate ball. Good job by Seattle. Terry Taylor. 70 points for him now. Third most in the lead. And that is caught at the 17-yard line. Right there is Darden. He has stopped in his tracks right there. So Seattle gets the ball right back. It's a look you like to run the football. Remember, Seattle has not run the football well all year. They're 30th in the entire NFL. Even here when Owens comes down to safety, this time he misses. But they sat back, respecting Geno Smith in his passing game, putting it on that offensive line in the running game. Average over 7.5 yards a carry on that opening drive. Let's see if they make any adjustments here from Eric Washington. in the D.C. At the back of Charbonnet and Geno slips, falls down and is taken down. So that'll be a gift sack as Geno Smith lost his footing here at Soldier Field, taken down for a 7-yard loss. Yeah, just coming off of the naked, his right foot gets stuck underneath Charbonnet. Right there, he actually steps on it, and that's why he ended up going down. Able to hold on to that football. You can see a Bears player getting in there. Looked like maybe Demarcus Walker knocking it away. Yeah, just stepped on Charbonnet. Now they're behind the sticks. Walker gets credit for a Christmas day after sack. Smith sends it out to Charbonnet. Room to room. Down the sideline, he goes. Setting up a third and manageable. Now third and seven. I love this guy. I love Charbonnet. I love backs like this. He's just kind of running with a purpose, running with a chip on his shoulder. Big opportunity for he and Kenny McIntosh tonight. Like I said, he runs tough. He's a slasher, but he has soft hands out of the backfield. And when he catches the ball, boy, can he accelerate. And now gives him a shot, a real shot here on third and seven. Send him out. Wide to the right for the moment and then bring him back into the backfield. The three top receivers all set to the left side. Smith, deep drop, looking, firing, incomplete. Jackson Smith and Jigbo, the intended target there. So, slipping, falling down, making contact with the footer Charbonnet. Puts him in a big hole, fourth down. Yeah, they walked fresh up. That's seven guys up, only brought five. And they drop a couple guys back, including 55 to the far right there, Jacob Martin. But Jackson Smith and Jacob works right there, comes right back to where he is. And for whatever reason, Geno Smith avoided the pressure. Metcalf downfield, he wants a shot at it. But for the first down, it was open. And he avoided the pressure, just not able to throw an accurate ball. Michael Dixon, the punter. Backing up, fielding at the 22. Blackwell. Josh Blackwell brings it out to the 29. Kenny McIntosh makes the tackle. Six minutes to go in the first quarter. 3-0. One of the things with Caleb Williams, looking at his college career and in the NFL, is he has a tendency to want to hold on to the ball. Some of that is maybe him wanting to try to make big plays. But you go all the way back to his freshman year at Oklahoma. You can see what he did. 3.5 as a young player. Then he goes to USC with Lincoln Riley. 3.2. Another year with Lincoln Riley 3-2. And then you see this year with the Bears, he's the fourth slowest in the NFL. And, again, part of that is him holding the ball, working through progressions. And part of that, I think, is him trying to hold on to the ball, scramble, and make a big play. Taking 60 sacks this season. Rolling to his right, throwing to D.J. Moore. Moore will pick up about nine. Run out by Nwosu. Second and one. Good slide route there. where DJ Moore comes from the backside and just kind of works his way out to the flat. It's a really easy call. Try to get the quarterback, Caleb Williams, after that first three and out. Just try to get him an easy throw, kind of get him into that rhythm, get this offense where the potential pressure could come from. And then that flash is a pressure alert, meaning this is where, obviously, that the quarterback has got to be able to deal with the most obvious pressure where this defense is able to crank it up. That time it was T.J. Edwards, the middle linebacker, who was blitzing. Dixon's third punt, sixth punt of the night. Downed inside the tent. So we've had six punts and a field goal. First down for the Chicago Bears from the nine-yard line. Williams. Moore. D.J. Moore. Flag is down. The second one. This one will be against Chicago. Pass interference on the offense. Number two. After distance of the goal. First down. Well, you saw Eric Dickerson play. I called a bunch of his games through the years. I saw Eddie George on TV. Eddie George reminded me of the scene. Upright. Upright. Yeah. But E.D. loves that record. Eric Dickerson, of course. He was my partner in Monday Night Football for years on the sideline. But Saquon Barkley, I mean, a fantastic season. And as Kaylee said, one extra game. But, you know, it's still going to go into the record books. Everybody put an asterisk. I mean, I got a pass out here to D.J. Moore. He's taken out of the two-yard line. by the way there's our guy again Devin Witherspoon always up near the line of scrimmage able to get off blocks this time it's Keenan Allen who's a much bigger 6'2", 211 pounder I just want to keep saying this guy's 180 pounds they move him around right now playing that nickel anticipating the throw works off of that block leverages the football almost gets him tackled in the backfield or almost in the end zone Keep your eyes on 21. How much fun is he to watch? First round pick last year. Number five overall. Second and 17. Williams fires from the outside. Moore makes the catch. And the former Carolina Panthers. Taken out of bounds. After a pickup of 10. Third down and seven. It's incredible. You think of what Caleb Williams is doing now. He had thrown an interception against an NFC team all year. 335 pass attempts. The only quarterback to not throw an interception in conference games for an entire season was Troy Aikman for the Cowboys back in 1993. Cowboys went on to win the Super Bowl last season. Third and seven. Williams set up a screen here and a lot of room to roam out past the 30 to the 36 goes DeAndre Swift and that finally gives the Soldier Field crowd something to get excited about they blitz their middle linebacker Jones right here and once you blitz him there's just nobody there on that right side that picked up the back out of the backfield see those offensive the linemen downfield. Boy, that was a great time for that screen. They go quick. Meanwhile, you've got Kobe Bryant coming up with the ball, but he thinks he has the pick, but you've got a flag on the play. Bears race up to the line. What they even said is the question. The Wusu couldn't get off the field. Watch Caleb Williams. They go tempo, and the Wusu cannot get off the field, kind of limping off. And the reaction from Caleb Williams. He still has the ball. Guys, guys, we had 12 over there. 10 didn't get off the field. And there he is jogging off the 12th man right there. So he obviously knew he had a free play. Talking about the 12th man and the 12s. You're talking about Seattle, of course. As we mentioned, the top is so bizarre. At home, 3-6 this year. On the road, they've only lost once. Swift picks up the first down. So after a ragged start to this drive from their own two-yard line, they're out to midfield. It felt like here you go again after the play by Witherspoon after the penalty, but the stream pass got them a big play, and now they've got a little bit of confidence going, and another good run there by Swift. You mentioned names, and now you've got the ball coming out. The play was whistled dead, so that's all showing what we think it is for the moment. So the crowd, of course, takes us a touchdown. Tired of Gordon, but only in their dreams. He's not sure for anything. Guy goes into the end zone. They've had so little to cheer about, obviously, this season. Was he down here? Ball is out. Yeah, the crowd is slicking. He's down. He's at the officials. We did not rule the runner down. The ball is out. Touchdown. Oh! Ow! Well, there were no officials that went down there. So we for the moment thought it was down. Now the Bears, they realize what happened. Lockett's saying, you've got to be kidding me. it's one thing for the ball to come out how is he not touched by Farrell Brown when he looked like he was still laying on top of him when he picked the ball that would be Gordon's first career touchdown, so he goes down by himself everybody else is hanging around the line of scrimmage, right? there's nobody on the field at that point that thinks it's a fumble except Gordon now I think he's down by contact yeah they well they're gonna take a look at that old all TVs get here did fumble the ball however we should probably pick it up he was down by contact with that spot there's the reaction in Chicago's ball they'll bring it back there is no touchdown give it take us the holiday season So, Chicago will get possession of it. The down-by-contact spot is going to be the 38-yard line in the game clock. Should be a one-minute, 50 seconds, 1-5-0. That's all you need to know. Well, it's a good job there, nonetheless. A lot went on there. Gordon gets the ball out. Bears do get the ball. They don't get the touchdown, but fights to get that football out may recover it. Scott Novak led us to commercial. Jalen Johnson just did on that last series. So Chicago gets the ball from the spot where contact was made after the fumble. Ball at the 38-yard line. They start this drive with a pass that's juggled and caught. And the longtime Charger team in Allen picks up about six. You know, we were talking a lot there before that fumble about this big decision and what Chicago's going to do. Kaylee had a nice report, and we talked about kind of that cycle of dysfunction of hiring a coach, drafting a quarterback, struggle, fire a coach, hire another coach, and on and on and on. There's some examples right now of teams that have been able to find that right guy. The Lions, they found the right guy that changed the culture. Meanwhile, here's a run by Williams. You know, how would you say the commanders with new ownership hired Dan Quinn, drafted Jaden? I mean, they broke a cycle. It feels like they're in the process of breaking a cycle. So that's my point, I guess, about not just looking for a guy that fits Caleb Williams and the XOs. Obviously, that's important. I think it's a personality. It's a guy who can stand there and take the bullets and change this culture. It's been going on forever. And run the room. Yeah. That's caught by Allen. Some of the names we talked about, other names, Brian Flores in Minnesota. Bill O'Brien is another name that's popped up a long time. Houston Texans coach was with Belichick in New England, now at Boston College. We already talked about Pete Carroll, his name floating. You talked about Mike Vrabel earlier. Right. So who knows what direction they'll go. Meanwhile, there goes Williams You talk about a sack A killer sack He got him spinning and running And the whole thing And when you get him down on a play like that That's a 14-yard sack Yeah, and I think if you've not seen him play a lot this year It's recognizing things There's a defensive alert with Tyrese Knight Coming on that blitz Nwusu, both of them are able to get in there But it's easy to sit there and say Quit taking sacks but it helps to have a little bit of protection. It helps to have quick answer. 14-yard sack. D.J. Moore is in the backfield. The wide out lines up there a lot. He moves off to his left. Williams fires over the middle. That's a knockdown of the line of scrimmage. William Jenner and Wosa to make it third down and 24. He keyed. Swift. He's going to try to hurdle, but nothing happening there. As he takes it to the 48-yard line. That's a gain to three. It'll be second down and seven on the Seattle side of the field. Caleb, I thought, had a chance to be a hero here. But he thought about it. He got out in front. And then he just kind of tried to stand in the way he set a screen. Instead of picking up a block. And then Swift goes airborne for some reason. Lucky he got up from that. Second and seven. Roshon Johnson now running back. Wearing the Guardian cap is Johnson. Swift in motion. Williams under pressure. Williams is going to go down at the 50-yard line. So the pocket collapsing. Derek Cole comes in there. See if they give him the credit, and they will for the sack of two yards. Just kind of an example of what we're talking about with Caleb Williams. and you almost pre-snap have to feel that this isn't going to work. There's the motion by DeAndre Swift, and he's locked in on trying to force his ball downfield to Keenan Allen. Meanwhile, if he just aborts that right away, he could just flip it out in the flat. He's got Swift with a blocker in front of him. Third and nine. Quick toss. Has blocking. Great run. Still going to the 31-yard line goes D.J. Moore. That's been a big part of his game again this year is the yards after the catch and his quick throws. He almost has a build of a running back at 210 pounds. Good job of getting out there quickly by Caleb Williams. Komet does a good job. Darnell Wright's out there. Really, look at Darnell Wright for a big offensive tackle flying downfield. And then this is what he brings, is that just natural feel as a ball carrier, protecting the football. Nobody's going to take him down. He's going to keep moving those legs and keep getting yards. Good effort there by D.J. Moore. Five minutes left in the half. Johnson. Uh-uh. Taken down right there by Leonard Williams in his 10th year in the league and probably playing as well as ever, maybe even better. I agree with you. Watch him use his hands and a little swim move, and he's right in the backfield. Johnson never really had much of a chance. We talked with him this week, and he even thought that this year's 10th year might be one of his best. And, I mean, if you look at the film and look at the shape that he stays in, he just jumps off the screen when you turn on film and watch the Seahawks defense. Snap wound up on the ground. Williams picks it up, throws, and completes it to Keenan Allen. makes a great play after what could have been a disaster a gain of 16 how about him dealing with a lot, this is again this is Caleb Williams, this is what he does here's pressure, middle linebacker Tyrese Knight comes, balls on the ground instead of running he just got almost like a no look pass how about just dealing with that, pressures in his face and then just a quick flip to Keenan Allen for first down yardage. Just like you drew it up in the grass there. Type of play you'd expect out of a guy picked number one in the draft. From the 17, Williams steps up, flag thrown, passes thrown out of bounds. Pretending for Everett the tight end. We'll see about the call from Scott Novak. Little shift on the offense, four players' movement. Number four did not reset. That's going to be a five-yard penalty. that's Swift Seattle is declining the penalty you'll make it second now it'll take the play so second and tennis at a first and 15 well it's a great drive is started at their own nine backed up to their own two at one point. Ten plays, 74 yards. Go five wide on second and ten. Dancing, looking, throwing, and has to throw that one away. So it'll be third down and ten now. They're able to pressure with four and again do a really good job of not letting him get out. You know when he gets out to scramble, now he's scrambling to throw. He has his whole career. He's not scrambling to run so you've got to do a good job of just kind of pushing a bit of a flow themselves. He's spectacular when he's on the move as a passer. Comes up in the pistol for the first time on a second and one. play action over the middle, that's caught and very close to that first down is Swift to really give forward progress tackle there by Nwoso again he has enough of the first down up at the 40 I think any time you go up against Caleb Williams and his big play ability as a defense, there's a few things number one, you want to give him a variety of looks especially in the NFL you have so many different pressure packages and so many different coverages you can play and make him have to go through that Rolodex and think fast and get him uncomfortable. And then the other thing is squeeze the pocket. You cannot allow him to get out and create. Through the middle. A little bit of room there for DeAndre Swift, taken down by the rookie number one draft choice, number 91, Byron Murphy. When I went down the field, I was reminded I hadn't seen Caleb since he was at SC. And, you know, like Brock Purdy and Russell Wilson and so many other quarterbacks, the size of his calves and his legs where all that power and torque is created, he has really, really strong legs, which allows him to create, I think, as quick of a twitch in his passing releases as maybe anybody in the league. Yeah, you can see it from 50 yards away. Rolling looking and then throws that one out of bounds He was way out of bounds Keenan Allen was closest to it but he wasn even that close Third down and five Yeah this is a defense that feels confident We were just talking about Chicago sitting back with two safeties back and relying on their front. Seattle will do that a bunch as well. They want to take away some of the easy passing lanes downfield with those two safeties back, any shots downfield, and try to put the pressure of the run game on their front and their linebackers who they think can win this matchup. Against the Bears. Roshan Johnson is the third down back. Seahawks show pressure. Here they come. And the pass is dropped. Would not have been a first down anyway. Keenan Allen passed a little bit low. The long time charger. Ernest Jones, the former Ram who started the season with Tennessee and then got traded over here in the middle of the year, put the heat on that time. They did a good job. And there's seven up, and then you'll see him drop a couple, including Jaron Reed, the big fella, dropping in case there's a throw underneath. He read it perfectly, even dealt with the pressure from Ernest Jones and got enough on it to be able to pick up that first down. But Keenan Allen, the veteran, usually very, very shorthanded, unable to hold on to that throw. When Tandler got drafted to punt the fourth round, Tandler Williams sent him a note and said, hey, you won't have to punt that much. I'll take care of that. Well, 71 points, third most in the league. fielded at a six and taken down right off the bat Tyler Scott made that tackle with 3.45 to go in the first quarter and Seattle on top 3-0 I'm going to go all in on this we're here the linebackers that are trying to slow this running game Edmonds and Edwards, a couple of veterans. From the five-yard line, Smith and Jigler was the man on the move. And that hole closed quickly, but able to run through. The traffic was Kenny McIntosh for a pickup of six, second down and four. Yeah, we talked about the linebackers, but really you need help from that defensive line to keep them off. At that time, Jonathan Ford, who came in, it's like a second unit in there right now. 64. He's able to penetrate. Looks like he might make a tackle for a loss, but give credit to McIntosh for keeping those legs moving. On the ground again. In the 13-yard line, setting up a third and short, Kenny McIntosh. The Seahawks have normally been very deliberate. They have run the fewest plays in the league, 59 per game. Well below the league average. Yeah, which, you know, if you look at Ryan Gruff's history, he does like to typically get things going a little bit faster. And they do mix tempo in from time to time. But you're right. They've been deliberate. Maybe that's complementary football with the offense and the defense, keeping that in mind. Third and two. The big goal of Seattle's tonight, just based on a lot of their film study, was they felt that if they could take away Caleb Williams' primary receiver, that as a young quarterback still kind of working through his progressions and getting comfortable, that they could get him uncomfortable. And they've done a heck of a job on that second level and those crossing routes, their backers taking away that 18-yard, 15- to 18-yard crosser. And when that primary's not there, you can start to see him get uncomfortable, and that's where this pass rush has been able to affect him with five sacks. Third and 24. They only sent three this time. Pass is caught by Moore, but no place to go for DJ. Witherspoon making the tackle. So Williams tonight, 12 of 19 for 95 yards. Well, the boofers haven't been terrible. No, not at all. I think they're just starting to warm up. Right. They're just getting it going. The last home team of the season. Get it out of this system. Won't have a chance to do this for a while. Rough patch here in Chicago with the Blackhawks. That's what I was asking you about. And the White Sox. Anyway. Torrey Chandler to punt. This will be his sixth of the night. Bear catch goal for. made at the 14-yard line by Jalen Darden. A minute into the fourth quarter. That tells you a lot. 6-3 Seattle. That tells you a lot. That tie break, and then it can all the way down, believe it or not, strength of victory at some point. We'll get to that later, if you're interested. From the 14-yard line, Seattle begins this drive. traveling for a gain of one. And just to add on to that, let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. NFC playoff probabilities, the south and the west, plus the one wild card that's available. And you can see the commanders and Rams in really good position. And Falcons and the Bucs, we'll see how that shapes up here in the next couple weeks. And the Seahawks just holding on. It's amazing, this Seahawks team, watching them tonight. I know the Bears aren't having a great year. watching this defense play. This team was 8-5 just a few weeks ago and in total control of the West. They've lost two in a row to put themselves in the position they're in. Two at home to Green Bay and Minnesota. Here's Smith and Jigba. But it's crazy because if these two teams, Rams and Seahawks, wound up, let's say, in the tie, same record. So you'd go to head-to-head. Let's say if they wound up in the tie, Seattle would have to win that game. Then you go to division games. Then you would go to common games. Then you go to conference games. It's all about the same. They'd go to something called strength of victory. You're sitting there watching the Jets and the Bills, wondering how that's going to impact that race. Other teams will determine whether the Rams can wrap it up before that game against Seattle. Third down and three. Simplify it. If you're a Seahawks fan, you're pulling for Kyler Murray to win Saturday night. A win tonight, an Arizona win, and they got a chance. Nothing happened. here on the third down and three. T.J. Edwards blows that play up fourth down. This is the part up front where the offensive line not able to get up to that middle linebacker. Really good job. T.J. Edwards' instincts, you know, great years, of course, going back to when he was leading that Philly defense, taking that talent now to Chicago with his ability to recognize and get downhill in a hurry and did that perfectly there on that third and short. Dixon's fifth punt. Eleventh punt of the night. A lot of altitude on this baby. Caught him to 25. Escaping a tackle back there. And a nice run back of 14 yards from the 39 by Josh Blackwell. 11.43 left in rig. Fox by three. How much fun has it been to watch Leonard Williams tonight double teamed? 13 of the 23 pass rushes that he has had still making a difference. Five pressures and a sack in this game despite those double teams. And a lot of times he gets double teams, he opens it up for others to come up with big plays. But he has had a great year, and it continues tonight here in Chicago against his Bears offense. 10th season in the league, played his college ball at USC. I think he might be in the best shape of his. Smith looks to run and looks to throw, and it is juggled and incomplete. Smith and Jigga is there, so is Tyler Gordon to break it up in his fourth down. I really thought he might take off and try to make this. There's man-to-man coverage. Now, Edmonds does a nice job of just kind of following him in the middle here, just keeping his eye on him because there's man-to-man. He's responsible for Geno Smith, and once Geno goes, he's going to try to chase him down. Pretty good coverage there, sticky coverage by the nickel, the slot corner, Kyler Gordon sticking with 11, which is not easy to do, especially in that scramble mode. So Michael Dixon in the punt for the second time. His first boot was 58 yards. Josh Blackwell back to receive. Coasting over. Gold score makes the fair catch at the 30-yard line with 2-12 to play in the first quarter. 3-0 Seattle. We're back in 30 seconds. That last punt by Dixon Was 56 yards Bears now start from the 31 Williams is 2 of his first 5 For 11 yards Little toss, Swift Taken down, bursting through Coming through, Evan Witherspoon And when McDonald was talking about him Last week, I mean he just said I'd like to have 11 of these guys. Yeah, it's amazing. It's so much fun to watch him because he can play in so many different spots. He's up here close to the line of scrimmage. Keep in mind, he's not a big guy. You can see he's a football player. It's probably the best compliment you can give a guy that plays multiple positions. He's a nickel. He's a corner. He can do anything. He can play linebacker if they want to. Keep in mind, he's about 180 pounds flying around making plays like that. Fifth overall pick in the draft is D.J. Moore. D.J. Moore able to stay in bounds to pick up a few more yards. It was second and 17 after that 7-yard tackle for loss. Now it's third and 6 after an 11-yard gain. He's so quick after the catch. Done a great job in this offensive scheme, despite all of the distractions, firing an offensive coordinator, and everything working with a new young quarterback as a rookie. DJ Moore, they've relied more on a lot of those kind of plays, screens, quick throws, and relying on yards after the catch has a chance to get to 1,000 yards this year. Final minute of the quarter. Williams avoids a sack, fires too high. Incomplete, intended for a dunes, a Mr. McGinn fourth down. here's an example of two rookies still figuring it out adunze is wondering do i want to settle coming off this this this end breaking route he thinks i got a soft spot i'm going to settle right here and the quarterback reads that he's going to continue to work across the middle so both guys not quite on the same page one settles one's throwing it see right there keep working across the middle, so not on the same page, and that's kind of a their season really in a nutshell. Torrey Taylor's third putt. Bearcats fall for him, made at the 16-yard line by Jalen Darden. 41 seconds left in the opening quarter. So Williams, three out of seven now for 22. And again, you see that, and you see the ball that sails on him and it's easy to say what the heck's he thinking and we're sitting up here we have no idea i mean it looked like to me the dunes they had settled in a really nice spot but as these guys work more and more together it's not about talent it's just about staying on the same page reading coverage on the fly and making your adjustments as receiver and a quarterback based on what you see. Smith fires it to the outside. That's DK Metcalf. Takes it up to the 21-yard line, battling through some injuries this season. Smith and Jigba has become their top receiver. DK, meanwhile, 60 catches. Smith and Jigba with 93. Second down and five. Waning moments in the quarter. Don't have to run a play. Charbonnet is the back and they may let the block run out which they do and we put Jake Bobo in in his spot so it moves it back to the 24 the fouls or excuse me personal foul So they called it a personal foul instead of what, unsportsmanlike conduct? Whatever it is, there he is on the sideline. Clock is now running. Terry, can you explain the difference there and why? Well, there were contact fouls, and there were two contact fouls, so that's unnecessary roughness in the NFL. It's not unsportsmanlike conduct, so neither of those count toward disqualification. That's a critical difference there. Two-minute warning. So during the break, you've got Tyler Lockett going up to DeMarcus Walker saying, come on, man, what's that all about? They get separated, and here's Metcalf, you know. Metcalf's ready to take on the whole Bears defense. Maybe they're going to liven up the game a little bit. 3-3 with two minutes to go. Tyreek Stevenson of course gets involved in it second and 16 after the two-minute warning pass is caught nice game here Noah Fant takes it after the 37-yard line making it third and three This is the suburbs of Seattle's you guys bringing it down there Even Richard didn't know what I was talking about Third down and three from the 37-yard line. Smith. A lot of room to roam for Fant, and he takes it to the 49-yard line. So back-to-back throws to Noah Fant in the first down. Clock running 138, 137, counting down. Tony Gonzalez has got to love to watch Noah Fant and what he's doing after the catch now. Boy, with A.J. Barner coming along as the rookie tied in, it's really freed him up to make more plays. Smith escapes, throws, hold in at the 37-yard line. So Metcalf now gets into the action. D.K. Metcalf holding it in. That is his second catch of the night. Like I said, I think Stevenson may have lit a fire and ignited D.K. Metcalf when he was jawing at him, saying, watch, watch when I get back out there. what's about to happen. Pocket breaking down. He's going to keep it. He's going to slide to a stop at the 33-yard line. They'll mark it closer to where he started the slide of the 34. Timeout taken here. Timeout Seattle. 53 seconds left in the hand. Wildcard weekend and only on prime. 16th of course that weekend. Saturday, Sunday, Monday. It'll be somewhere. Meanwhile, it's raining harder than it has all night. It's been sprinkling and drizzling and off and on, but coming down right now as the half concludes. Second down and six from the 33-yard line. On the ground. Stuffed. Zach Charbonneau. Taken down there. Third down. Scourgino Smith takes control. Still, of course, has the two timeouts. Third and five. Now they're going to use the timeout. Yeah. A little bit of confusion trying to get their play set up. Looks like Metcalf is... Why am I not in the game at this point? You keep forgetting the Chicago Bears. Again, we go back to what happened in Washington, where they came from behind at the end, took the lead, looked like they would win. That would have made them 5-2. They had games coming up against Arizona and New England. They might have been 7-2, and so they won since October. Yeah, it's incredible. I don't know if I can ever remember a game where one play flipped an entire season around, led to an offensive coordinator being fired, and then eventually a head coach being fired, and they haven't won a game since. I mean, we all watched that play and thought, what's he doing over there talking to the crowd? And then he ends up tipping the ball. And then, man, it's been spiraling ever since. Yeah, and then Miller-Brown came down with it. Meanwhile, Smith throws, and it's batted at the line of scrimmage. It's incomplete. So that'll make it fourth down. Looks like Jake. That's the entire 2024 season. Last couple of games from last year. Second down and eighth. Four minutes into the game. Give it up the middle. McIntosh inside the 20 to the 16-yard line. So this team, which, as we mentioned, doesn't run that much and doesn't run with great effectiveness, is running with great effectiveness on this drive. Watch this block by Ola Timmy. The center, who's taken over in the inside. Going to go a little tempo here. They like to mix it in. but a really good job of opening that hole with the center. That was a 25-yard pickup, and this is a two-yard gain for Kenny McIndoch on what was the eighth play of the drive, six of them runs. Yeah, they must not have gotten the memo that they have struggled to open up holes, and even without their starter, Walker, in the lineup, this offensive line gets on the road against this Bears team. You can see the rushing yards. The entire game against Minnesota, 59 yards to the game already, 48 in this opening drive. Charbonnet comes into the backfield to Frank Smith. Metcalf bottom of the screen to the left. Keep it on the ground. Inside the 10. Charbonnet, third down and three. Geno Smith wants to be smart, take care of the football. They've had some issues down in this red zone area. The four interceptions in the red zone inside that 20, most in the entire league. Right now, the way they're pushing this Bears front around. An interesting call here for Ryan Grubb. Third and three. Yeah, that's one of those great oddities. I mean, they move the ball between the 20s, and they get inside the red zone and four picks, and that's a ton from inside the 20. Third and three, fires over the middle and nearly has that as his fifth interception. Tremaine Edmonds is right there, angry with himself, could have had it, but doesn't, and Seattle has to settle for a three-point attempt. You know, when you see a decision like this by Geno Smith, who typically makes so many good decisions, you wonder if he's just predetermined to get the ball into locket. I mean, both linebackers, not one of them, both there. Look at Edmonds, who struggles typically in coverage. This time he reads the eyes. It takes him right to the intended target. Should have been picked off his fifth of the year. Yeah, there are tight windows, and then there are windows that don't have any glass in them. Jason Myers, 27-yard field goal attempt is good. So they run 11 plays, counting that one, seven runs of you guys. It's been fantastic. Meanwhile, it starts to rain, as you can see. Light rain. They set about a 20% chance, and that has come to fruition, at least for the moment. Temperature in the low 40s. 3-0 Seahawks. Tyler Scott is back there. Let's hit bound through the end zone, and Caleb Williams will come out onto the field. So Caleb Williams, if he starts next week, he'll become the first Chicago quarterback since Jake Cutler in 2009 to start every game of a season. You look at those numbers. That's almost a 4-1 touchdown-interception ratio. No interceptions in nine games. You look at those numbers, you go, wow, they must be having a tremendous year. It's weird. Yeah, it is strange. I think it has a lot. But numbers can be a little bit misleading. They've been outscored 89-20 in the first quarter. They dig themselves a hole, and then they're playing catch-up. And, you know, he's done a good job of protecting the football. But let's see if they can stay in this game early and see how he can play and decision-making he can make. Yeah, they dig themselves a major hole. Here's DeAndre Swift. He picks up a couple his first year here. Swift was with Detroit, had a 1,000-yard season. Let him go. Goes to Philadelphia. Good year there. Last year for him, they let him go. Of course, we've got Barkley, and he winds up here. This is, you know, across the league. Everybody wants to know about Caleb Williams. You'll see some of the plays that he makes, and you just marvel at the physical ability that he has. But he told us even this week on our Zoom about how much he's learned here in his first year about preparation and just the aspects of away from the field. This is Roshan Johnson. They have Swift and Johnson sharing time in the backfield with Swift doing the bulk of the ball carrying. Third down and five now. And they come up no huddle. And here he's going to get tested against a pretty aggressive defense. Mike McDonald very good at creating pressure. He's out surfing off Manhattan Beach right now. Zach Charbonnet out to the 49-yard line. But it is interesting because, I mean, Ben Johnson, the offensive coordinator of Detroit, he's the name that everybody always wants to talk about. There's Ryan Poles, the GM of the Chicago Bears. He's the obvious one that people are going to talk about, no matter who has an opening. I don't know if it's, you and I were talking about this in a meeting, I don't know if it's just X's and O's. Kevin Warren, the president and CEO, obviously would be very involved in that decision. I think you need to find a guy that can help you change culture as much as you can when it comes to X's and O's. Agreed. Smith avoids a sack. Look out from behind. Ball is out. Who's got it? Ball was alive. Darryl Taylor was the guy who knocked it out of his hands. And it appears as if he will retain possession, at least that's the indication, as the Bears begin to walk off the field. And the Seahawks at the bottom of that foul. Only with Timmy, the center. Only with Timmy picks it up. I'm just glad he's okay. I did a college game a few weeks ago, and Carson back, very similar type of play, and he's now had surgery on his elbow, and he's done for the year. So good to see that he's okay, and the Seahawks fortunate to be able to jump on that football. So the sack will go to Darrell Taylor. Fourth down and into punt. After their first possession is Michael Dixon. He's averaging 49 yards a boot This is his fourth punt of the night And it will bounce just outside the 15-yard line And Chicago will start from there 8-13 left in the third quarter Seattle on top, 6-3 Next October So the Bears trying to give the home crowd Something to get excited about in their final home game of the year. They end the season up in Green Bay a week from Sunday. Swift to the 19, tackled by Ernest Jones. We've seen Caleb Williams tonight with his playmaking ability. Remember that low snap and he was able to pick it up and locate a receiver and make a throw to Keenan Allen and he made so many spectacular plays and he got such physical ability I think the thing that remains to be seen and only time will tell is if he understands what it takes to be an NFL quarterback as far as the preparation, as far as first guy there, last guy to leave. And I'm not suggesting he's not doing those things, but just all of the little things that really make the great quarterbacks special. Bying time. Off to the races. He goes. Steps out of bounds. Makes up the first down. Let's go to Kaylee. Guys, Caleb Williams has earned the respect of his teammates, especially through this losing streak. Jalen Johnson told me Williams has proved he is not a soft quarterback, and he'll continue to battle, even when things aren't going their way. Johnson described seeing Williams still trying to improve, playing to win, and said his fight is continuing to go up. Johnson said Williams has the right mentality when it comes to competing, and it's something he really loves about him. It was pretty clear a couple of years ago he was going to be the number one pick when he came out of college, and he was. Something to do about his final year at SC. Here comes the screen. Here comes Swift going nowhere. And I asked Williams, I said, were you paying a lot of attention because you knew you were going to be the number one pick? He said, oh, yeah. So he says, as the season wore on, I looked at the Bears more and more. Yeah. No, he is completely dialed in. Such a bright guy. And what Kaylee's saying is true. His teammates love him. They did at USC. It was questioned around the program, his commitment, and different things as far as is he a great teammate. And everybody you talk to who's actually on his team says he's a great teammate. What I'm talking about is what all rookie quarterbacks, what Bo Nix is learning, what Jaden Daniels is learning, what Michael Penix now is starting to learn is just you can't just be a great physically gifted quarterback and maybe that was okay in high school and even in college at an elite level up here everybody is so good and the timing and everything is so precise that the more you can do the over preparation that you can do is only going to benefit you in the long run again they've got to find a new head coach, they've got to find a system They've got to build it around him. They've got to get better around him. Not that you want to coach it to always underthrow that ball, that go ball, but that ball goes not only over his outside shoulder, but so far almost out of bounds. If you throw that where he has to work back to it, that's going to be pass interference because he had him beat by a couple steps, but instead it's out of bounds. The Doomsday could not work into the defender there. Third and ten. Deep drop. Steps up. Fires into Nome's land. Nothing happening. Just a bunch of white shirts. So it's fourth down. Kirk, do you realize earlier this season, my men, George Hill and Malibu Kelly Hayes telling me, Seattle beat Chicago earlier this year. Six to three. In a soccer game? Nope. Mariners beat the White Sox in Chicago on July 29th. There you go. History repeats. Oh, man. Did they ever go 6-6 and go to extra innings? Oh, baby. I've done a couple of those games. Fourth down. I hope you don't get to do it now. We'll see. Anything can happen here. Fourth down and 10. Second turn. Time out. Seattle. The Seahawks take their time out here. So, you get a first down. They've got to get to the 30. Chicago still has the one timeout. So if they can move it a little bit. Well, they've got to get the first out here is what it amounts to. So they're eschewing the opportunity to kick what would be a game-time field goal from 57 out. This drive, I've seen Caleb Williams and where he can make plays. You get excited about this guy's playmaking ability. Fourth and five. Gets out of there. Somehow locates D.J. Moore for a first down. The game could be over if he doesn't hit that. How about this one? Third and 14. Roma Doomsday. He's making plays. Let's see what he does here. Got to get 10 or it's good night. Irene throws it up in the air. And it is intercepted by Reek Wolden. Didn't matter. Interception and completion was all going to be the same. Pressure was put on by Colby Bryant. and that's going to take us to the finish line in 11 seconds. They blitzed him all night. Sometimes he scrambled, made plays. Other times they had success. This time it's, you know, we've seen different outside linebackers and defensive backs pressure. This time it's number eight, closest to you, able to come off that edge. They brought Julian Love, both safeties, Love and Kobe Bryant. Nobody's there to pick up Kobe Bryant. They just brought one too many from that side. Caleb Williams tried to just basically throw it up, get enough on it to try to hope that somebody could come down with it, and the Seahawks get their win. So that's the way the non-interception streak is. Got a little backflip in the backfield. So Williams had thrown 353 passes, and then that one gets picked. And of all things, just a prayer at the end of the game. McDonald's shaking his head. It was that kind of a night. Well, we thought we'd have 40-some-odd points tonight. We wound up. We're going to get out of bounds. And he does, and he gets pushed out of bounds. No flex. Crowd wanted one. But he was, in fact, they keep the clock running, which means he was tackled inbounds by Ernest Jones. But this time, how he gets out. the trouble, and like I said, he normally wants to throw the football out there. This time he decides to run, and he did for whatever reason. He just kind of takes a knee. Maybe he wants that clock to keep moving. Almost had a little fumble there, almost. To the outside. Allen, and that is busted up by Brown. Trey Brown stopping him there. So you've got a third down and two. Three and a half to go. All three timeouts for Chicago. He began to keep the drive going. That was one of the plays of the game by Trey Brown there on that second and short. Looked like an easy first down. Let's see what happens here on his third down. But gets off of the block and then makes the tackle all in really one motion. Great play by 22. Three minutes. Third and two. Blake Lockett, two. Williams. Going to keep it again. And let's see where they spot this. Leonard Williams makes the tackle. And you can see the official coming in. They're going to spot it. What appears to be short of the first down. Making it fourth down. And they're going to leave off, obviously, the offense out there at this point in the game. And go for it. Now, he didn't quite have a chance to extend the ball. to try to give it a chance to get close. I think the officials did a good job of spotting this about a half yard short. Fourth and inches. Go up in the gun. Johnson is the running back. It's going to be a timeout by the Seahawks. They wanted to see the alignment timeout in Seattle. Fourth and issues. Let's go back to that second down play that I mentioned is maybe one of the plays of the game. And now if they get a stop on fourth down, it really is. Trey Brown in because John Shelby went out with an injury. Look him get off of this block by a dunce and makes the tackle. That looks like they got the numbers that they want. Flip it out there. No problem with the size of a dunce at 6'3". But Trey Brown at 5'10", 185, off of that block and keeps him short of the first down. Then they come up with the, not the sack, but the tackle there of Caleb Williams. and here we go. Yeah, Brown had been a starter earlier in the year now backing up at that corner spot, fourth and inches. This time Williams comes up under center. Swift is the running back. Trying to get him to jump. Oh, wow. Who was it? Left guard moved. Offense to the 73. That's a five-yard center. Jay Curran gets a second penalty on him. You know, in the short yardage, you're an offensive lineman. That's one thing about that long cadence. You're sitting in there. You're sitting in there. You want to fire out. You want to fire out. It's so hard. You see just a little movement right there. And now they're deciding to punt the ball away. Curran, he was the guy who cost him what would have been the touchdown. That's right. Earlier in the game. And with the three timeouts and a two-minute warning, with the way their defense has been playing, much to the chagrin of the fans here in Chicago. They're going to trust their defense to get the ball back to Caleb Williams. Taylor averaging 47 yards a kick. This is his eighth of the night. Play is blown dead. Fly to the ball being snapped at the first-first timeout for Chicago. 30-second timeout. Oh, boy. I was going to say I agree with it because of a 6-3 defense playing well. Seattle's probably going to run the ball, force you to use your three timeouts. You have a two-minute warning. All that makes sense. And now it's some confusion, and you've got to spend the timeout. Absolutely. And now you're down to two timeouts. Yep. I mean, the logic made some sense. Originally, but the delay game, too. Now Caleb Williams is back out on the field, and now they're going to give it a go. And if they don't make it, you know, I don't want to say the game's over. You still have the two-minute timeout, two-minute warning. College, I'm going to ask Terry about that. They call it two-minute timeout. Whatever it is. Whatever the heck that is. Vernacular. Yeah. So fourth and five. Pressure on the left. Low, and that's Metcalf going down. Did he make the grab there? He did. And finally, Geno Smith gets the ball downfield off a play-action look. He's just not had an opportunity. Hasn't made many throws. That's a heck of a catch. That ball came so close to touching the surface. But we talked about he's averaging about two yards, his air yards tonight. Just nothing downfield this time on that deep crosser. Gets behind the linebackers and gives Metcalf a chance there. Yeah, he's battling through a whole bunch of injuries this year. Appears to be in a little distress on the sideline as he comes up. 23-yard game. Jake Lobo comes in in his place. A little toss back here. Charbonnet again. He joined the slate. Kenneth Walker is their number one back. Inactive tonight. Goes on injured reserve. And Charbonnet has done a heck of a job tonight. Charbonnet 15 carries, 58 yards. And he's picked up 17 more through the air. Yeah, thinking about this crowd and what this Bears fan base has faced. The Bears have not led a game since week 12 against the Vikings. It was 345 minutes of game time since the last time they had the lead. And it's the only time they took the lead in a game. In every other game, the opposition has scored first, including tonight. Smith has caught. Short gain, if any. Noah's fan out of bounds there. And again, I'm not trying to come to defense of Caleb Williams. I'm just trying to be realistic. Imagine being a rookie quarterback for your offensive coordinator who brought his system in in just the first year, and your head coach, both are fired. And you haven't had a chance to take a snap with the lead since week 11, week 12 against the Vikings. I mean, it's tough. Yeah, playing from behind all season. Third and six. Swing it out here. Charbonnet. He's stopped. And they get the ball back. This is beautiful third down defense. And sitting back in zone, trusting that front to be able to get the pressure. But watch how they leverage the football. Watch how the defense sits back. You've got a blocker out in front. You've got three defenders coming in to make the play. Just don't let him get back to the outside. Force him back inside, which is exactly what they did. And there's the Bears jerseys to bring him down. That's perfect execution. Edwards took the angle away. Meanwhile, here goes Dixon. his 6th punt, 13th punt of the game fair catch 4-4 and made it to 12 by Blackwell 5-12 left in the 4th still a 3 point game at Soldier Field William Slinger's our pressure alerts, defensive alerts to the red circles. Gives you an idea where the pressure is more likely to come from. The pressure alert is closer to him and eventually could bring him down. There's been a lot of blinking bodies and a lot of red circles all over Caleb Williams tonight. Up to six sacks and I don't think the Seahawks are done quite yet. He's ten sacks shy of the all-time record. Held by David Carr when he was drafted by the brand new Houston Texans back at the turn of the century when he went down 76 times. The 66 is by far, it's by 13 more than anybody else in the league. C.J. Stradd will be next. Williams will run for a game of about seven. This little wrinkle here, little zone read, read the end man on the line of scrimmage. Haven't seen this all game. He's reading Mafé right here. He collapses down. If he would have stayed wide, you hand it off. He collapses down. You pull it. Having shown it all game, an easy, quick way to be able to get eight yards and get out of bounds. Carry three times for 28 yards. Fakes the throw. Hands the ball off. Inside give. Look at that. Taking everybody with him is DeAndre Swift out to the 31-yard line. And Coleman Shelton with a great block downfield. See the tight end. Komet, and then the rest of the offensive line. 65 to center. He's freed up. Nobody in front of him touches and then gets upfield. There's 85. Now watch the collision with Wright, and then the rest of that line pushing him. Escaping, keeping. His career in year 10. He's never looked better. When you can run an interception back 92 yards, you're in fabulous shape. You have to be. From the 38-yard line. Start on the ground. Nice run here. Pickup of nine. Speaking of that run back. So you got Williams. Among other things that day in the Meadowlands, he had a blocked extra point. He had two sacks. He had this. He looks like a linebacker. Look at this. 92 yards. Meanwhile, back to live action here. and that should be a first down for you know what did that remind you of? that 92 yard run back defense James Harrison oh man you called that game right against Arizona end of the half Kurt Warner throws a pick and then that defense had been out on the field forever and ran 100 yards and barely got to the end zone he barely got to the end zone I felt like Leonard Williams, he was running through the back of the end zone. Oh, yeah, Williams looked fresh. He looked pretty good for 92 yards. He's ready to do a Meadowlands leap or whatever. Third and inches. And with the Guardian helmet, that's Johnson. Speaking of James Harrison. That had to be one of the best ones of all time, you call. Absolutely. Roethlisberger. Antonio Holmes, right? Terry McCauley was the referee in that game. All three of them in his illustrious career. The only news is it was a very well-officiated game. Terry, there you are. We're looking at you right now. That had to be one of your all-time games, too. Number one. That's great. You and me both. That's the best one I ever called. The Bengals-Rams that you had at SoFive. That was pretty good, too. Another good one. A lot of good ones, but I think that took the kick. Yeah, that one had so many moments. You had Harrison, you had Santonio Holmes, just unbelievable catch in the end zone. Second and eight here, the ball at the 49-yard line. D.J. Moore was the man in motion, and that's a pass into no man's land. Third down. Just, you know, he hurried this. He felt the blitz. Middle linebacker, Ernest Jones. and when Seattle got in there, actually they bring both their inside linebackers, shoot them right through both A-gaps, and he's trying to buy a little bit of time, but I think he felt that pressure and just hurried him, and it made him uncomfortable where he couldn't give the play a chance to really develop, and I think he still had enough time to just keep backpedaling, bring those linebackers towards him to give that play a chance. Third and eight, and they come again. Pressure, look out And he's going to go down again Rayshon Jenkins Comes from the secondary And for Caleb Williams Who came into the game having been sacked 60 times That's 6 more 66 By far the most in the league this season And look at the confusion they're creating You have Witherspoon who ends up coming late Jenkins over here that ends up pressuring. A couple of the guys in the inside end up dropping. The offensive line's confused. Caleb is confused, and give Mike McDonald and that defensive staff a lot of credit for their third down package in creating that confusion. Taylor punt number seven. Bear caught at the 11-yard line with 8.13 to play in the fourth. Seattle. This team has had a rough year. It's rained. It's the day after Christmas. You would think if there's ever a game, they would be leaving. Nobody's leaving. First of all, they showed up. What an amazing effort here by this Bears crowd today. Final home game of the season. We got big number 64, Jonathan Ford. Across the line. Nutrizone infraction on a defense number 64. That's a five-yard penalty. Well, everybody knows me. Chicago is a fantastic sports town. Here it is again. Yeah. So this is a great sports town. You know, I've known a ton of people from Chicago through the years. I go, who's number one? Is it the Cubs or the Bears? Most people will tell me anyway. It's the Bears. Always has them. Over the Cubs. Believe it or not. And, of course, you've got to take the Jordan era out. Of course. The Bulls, the Blackhawks have had a lot of success through the years. Smith fires over the middle. A lot of pressure. Throws. Catch is made. And staying in bounds, D.J. Moore on the run, reaching up, hauling it in. Got 14. First down. He pulled away in man coverage from Reap Woolen, who's an outstanding cover man. You'll see right over here, it's a foot race. What a job by Caleb Williams to keep this play alive. You talk about a miraculous throw. Great job of getting separation. Looks back to the backside and sees his main man, D.J. Moore, who comes down with that catch on that fourth down throw. Finally gets Williams over 100 yards tonight. 1-0-6. 2-0-5 on the clock. Drops it. Recovers. But he's going to go down again. At the 43-yard line, there's Williams right there. And that's going to take us to the two-minute warning at 157. This is the two-minute warning. Seattle on top, 6-3. Second and 15 when we come back to Soldier Field. 15 after Williams has just been sacked for the seventh time. Kyro Santos hoping for an opportunity. to perhaps tie the game to get a field goal chance here in the waning minutes. Second and 15. Quick pass there. Might have been tipped. Catch is made. But for a minimal gain by D.J. Moore. Third down. Luce did get a hand on that. A lot of these quick throws start to get their hands up as quick as they can. He didn't get his hands on the laces. There's the tip. Good focus again by D.J. Moore. Clock is ticking here almost at the 1.30 mark. Yeah, they've got two timeouts. It's a third and 14. Taking a ton of time here. And Leonard Williams moves around. He doesn't stay in the same spot. He's over that left, between that left guard and left tackle. And almost a full 40 between plays. Third and 14. Backing up. Backing up again. Pressured, escaping Fires And it is at the 40-yard line Did he hold it in? A Dunze And they're saying yes He caught it Now you've got to give a Dunze a lot of credit Obviously Caleb Williams to keep that play alive But a Dunze was almost down to the 20-yard line Had to work way back To come back to give Williams a target Meanwhile the clock is running down like crazy They still have the two timeouts, 38-37. Williams backing up again and fires that one out of that. Well, you know, you don't want to go back and be a bear span of Thanksgiving. You know what I'm talking about right now. You got the timeouts. Yeah. Oh, boy. Yeah, everybody, you can almost hear the crowd reliving that day. They sense it. Yeah. There's him working. He was back all the way to the 25-yard line. He came all the way back. Williams locates him. He makes a really nice catch to get his arms underneath so the ball couldn't touch the ground. So second time on this series, or this drive, they've been able to come up with great plays by Caleb Williams, improvising, and D.J. Moore, and now Roma Doomsday, the rookie, coming up with big plays to keep this drive alive. From here, you've been looking at a 57-yard field goal, and now Chicago has to take a timeout here. Oh, baby. The crowd knows it. I mean, they've already seen this clock management. Helped to create the coaching change after Thanksgiving. Wild card game coming up. I want to remind you, the weekend of January 11th and 12th. Prime video left. One of the wild card games for you. First ever playoff game on Prime. So right now you'll be looking if they don't gain another yard, a 57-yard attempt for Santos to send the game into. Caleb Williams was worked up there, frustrated. You see. Gary mentioned, you cut me off there. I'm glad you did. I know I did. I know. You didn't want me to go there. I did not. Second and 10 at the 40. What are you doing? Extra pressure downfield spinning the blues ain't no covered well Coverage on the play by reed woman third down to 10 with 26 seconds. That's one of those you got it beat you'd love to see that
