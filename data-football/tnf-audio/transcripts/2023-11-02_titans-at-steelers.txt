 How about Matt Canada? What a way to start this game. Yeah, the most relieved guy in the building. Chris Boswell for the point after. Took four minutes, 49 seconds for the Pittsburgh Steelers. But you're in the mid-40s. Careful towels as always in abundance. 7-0, the Steelers on top. Kaj√© Spears back to accept Boswell's kick. Runs it back from the five-yard line. Spears with a flag down for the moment gets up to the 28-yard line. Flag down to the 18. We're going to see Levish in a second after we hear from John Hussey. personal foul double team block receiving team number 23 and 28 that foul will be enforced from the spot of the foul after it's the goal first down they put that in the rule book a couple of years ago You don't see it very often, but it costs them here. So here is Levis. Adam, Kentucky started his college career at Penn State. Goes with Tannehill Hurt. He got the opportunity last week. Had very little practice time with the top receivers. But had those two weeks after they got back from Europe to get acclimated. They start with Derrick Henry in the backfield. One-yard game. Cam Hayward is there. So we talked about Hayward coming back. Groin injury opening day. Hasn't played since. And he's right in the middle of the action on the first play. And especially with Mika Fitzpatrick back. His leadership invaluable to make sure things are right. We'll talk more about that injury and how it could impact the back. But with Will Levis, it was funny to see you look at him in person on the field pregame. He said, wow, that's a big man. He's big and he's fast, too. Watching him run sprints. Cannon arm. Second and nine. Over the middle. That's caught up to the 16-yard line. Derrick Henry making the grab there. And a flag is down in the end zone. All the way back. They got to Levis late. It looked like T.J. Watt was trying to send a message early. We were talking to him this week on our Zoom about these new calls that are all over the NFL. Roughing the passer. Defense number 90. 15-yard penalty. This is one that got the Steelers last week. It's the body weight when he follows through. These guys are working as hard as they can to learn these rules, but finishing it through the surface is why that penalty is called on him. Well, Watt couldn't wait to introduce himself to Levis, but not to that extent. This is a different challenge for Will Levis, obviously. The two weeks to get ready for a Falcons defense, and tonight against a blitzing, attacking defense led by T.J. Watt on three days to get ready on the road. Very, very different. High snap, calls it in. King Henry, as they call him. You know, you talked about it in the Oakland, Kirk, The fact, just watching Levis last week, you know, some rookie quarterbacks come in, they look a little tentative. This guy looked like he owned the room right from the get-go. Yeah, I think we all saw the same thing, the poise, the command. And I think he even said that he's never felt more calm and confident than he did last week, even though it was his first start. Well, now all eyes of the NFL are on number eight, and they want to see how he's going to step up tonight. There's a look at Ryan Tannehill, the veteran who he's in for. Second down and six. Over the middle. Fires and that's incomplete. But a flag is thrown. Patrick Peterson came in there on the pass intended for Burks. Croutton already sends who the call is against. He tried to use his body weight. But he got his hands involved. It's a good call by the official. Five-yard foul, automatic, first down. Initially, Al, I think he's sensing that this route's going to work back to the middle with Burks, who's great to see him back in this lineup. See, right there, he's got a hold of the jersey. I mean, he's pulling it the whole way, trying to be that crafty veteran that he is now in his 13th year out of LSU. Only road him for about 10 yards. We're almost expecting him to go downfield. It's almost a step or two in front of him. No way he could get around him. Ryan Stonehouse, who set a record last year, breaking an 82-year-old record held by Sammy Baugh. Highest punting average. Booms this one to the 6-yard line. Austin brings it back out to the 17-yard line. A minute into the second quarter, and we're back. Kenny Pickett starting this drive for the Pittsburgh Steelers from their own 17-yard line. Steelers coming in 4-3. Times the 3-4. Steelers went all the way down the field on that first drive. Pickett leading the way. Start on the ground this time. 2-yard pick up here for Najee Harris to the 20-yard line. A game within a game here tonight is George Pickens, 14, who's a great vertical threat. And how Tennessee's secondary handles him, for the most part, early in this game, they've rolled up a corner up tight on him and put a safety over top, almost forcing Pickett to find other answers, whether it's Johnson on the other side or the back out of the backfield. They want to make somebody else beat them besides George Pickens and those explosive plays. over the middle and that's incomplete that time he tried to get it to pickens crowd wants the flag there as if they haven't seen enough incomplete third and eight there's an example it's tough for him to get downfield because again there's that corner up tight right here and there's the safety over top they're trying to take anything away downfield make him work to get to his spot so you're forced as a stealer you pick it you're forced to get him on the quick slant, the glance eight, and just anything underneath. Christian Fulton right there. Crowd, of course, saw the replay and said, where's the penalty? Warren is in the backfield. Third and eight. Pickett. Deep downfield, and that is incomplete. Could not hold on. Al Shire is back there. Calman Austin, who can fly, was down there, but well covered. It's fourth down and eight. Well, when you split the safeties, the danger is you get back here and back here. The danger is when you split them with speed the way Austin can get downfield. Now you've got a linebacker that's got to run with him. That ball's thrown just a little bit further. He gets underneath that and goes all the way to the end zone. Harvin's second boot backing up, fielding at the 20-yard line. Eric Garb and slips and falls up at the 28-yard line. Two minutes into the Steelers, and it's early in this game, but they have come after him, which you would expect him to do with T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith and company. But how about how he's responded? Here, backed up into his own end zone, first and 23, a first down. Here, first and 15, pressure. Just a simple check down to be able to get more positive yards and get back on schedule. So kind of showing some of the poise that we saw a week ago. Completely different challenge tonight on the road on a short week against his defense. Especially when you're looking across at number 90, T.J. Watt. And you've got an offensive line that's banged up. You're playing with some backup. Absolutely. Play action. Has time. fires caught Hopkins spins away picks up the first down still spinning like a whirling dervish breaking away from Joey Porter and a first down for Hopkins. I love the call not just for Levis but more importantly for the offensive line you show this look with a big man back here on first and 10 that's a run Steelers expecting run on first and 10 great time to help the protection and to help the quarterback there to be able to get some rhythm on a nice first and 10 play action pass. It's a good ball handler, too. You can tell on that play. First down from the 44-yard line. Now Henry. Up to the 49. He goes. That's making the tackle there. And it looks like runs out here. Yep. just what the Titans need another offensive lineman goes down yeah that's the right guard Daniel Brunskill came over from the 49ers as a free agent and Petit Frere at least comes back into the game some mixing and matching up front and Radins had come in licking his chops going against a guy who would be like the number three right tackle right now. Henry. It's around the corner. Goes it out to the 19-yard line. Landon Roberts makes the tackle. Now they held him again. Yeah, another flag. Holding. Offense number 85. Half position to the goal. First down. Tied in shape. Conquo. So it was a first and 19. Move it back to the five-yard line. Make it first down and 23 now. Yeah, Kwonko surprised that ball bounce all the way back to his right. That ball was expected to go underneath him. But everything taken away. Good job by Derrick Henry trying to keep the play alive. But once the leverage was lost, he just, again, had to grab onto him. Look at the field position. This is Steelers football. This is what they want. First and 23. Levis out of the end zone Caught on the run A first down and more To the 35 goes the Andre Hopkins Who had not scored a touchdown all season Then Levis comes in last week And throws three to him And a stealer is hurt And it's Cole Holcomb Who is down The linebacker 29-yard gain on that last play. Now watch the patience of the veteran Hopkins. Look at this. Almost just lulls the linebacker Holcomb to sleep, and then he gets hit by his own player right there. Just trying to look like Neal maybe ran into his lower body and took him down. Injury timeout, 46 ticks to the end of the quarter. Packers had a really good year. Came over from Washington. Missed a lot of games last year, had a foot injury, had surgery. It's one of those injuries, you know, we don't need to show a replay. I think we saw it live, and that'll take care of that. And just hope for the best for this guy. You could see the reaction from his own teammates after he went down, how serious that was. You got Quan Alexander, now he comes in to take his spot. He has seen a lot of action. It was a first and 19 play, and they picked up, first and 23 play, they picked up 29 yards on the Hopkins reception. So all the way out now to the 34, and what else is new? Another penalty. You've got a false start here. That's nine penalties in the first quarter. Offense number 15, five-yard penalty, first down. That's tied for the most in any quarter, in any game this season. It's not even June 14th. No, no. Yeah, yeah. Learn that. I got you, man. I got you. I got you. How about that throw, by the way, after those two holding calls that he's able to make? Maybe the throw of his young career, even though he threw four touchdowns last week, pinned inside his own five, and hits Hopkins for that first down. On a first and 15 now. Under pressure. Gets it away. It's caught and taking it up to the 40-yard line goes Kyle Phillips. Second year out of UCLA. That's going to be against these guys. And, you know, we just got to stay balanced and just take care of the football. All right. Thank you, Kaylee. Al Michaels with her curve street. Kaylee Hartung start the second quarter. Second down and four. Tennessee at its own 40-yard line. Levis. Pressure. Sacked at the 36-yard line. Alex Heisman gets that takedown. You get a good push in the middle from the rookie, Benton, which doesn't allow him to step up. That's what's important when you play the Steelers. Are you going to get a push up the middle? You know about Heisman. He did a great job at what he can do in applying that pressure. But when the Steelers start to win in the middle, like this, that's another holding call that they could have called there on Brewer. But I think what a future Keanu Benton has. Being able to complement what they can do on the edge with 90 and 56. Petit Frere who came out of the game standing on the sideline. Third down and eight. Levis goes deep downfield and nobody home there. Hopkins will be covered on the play. Looks for an infraction. Uh-uh. Joey Porta covering on the play. It's fourth down. That was a touchdown last week, right, against the Falcons. He was covered just like that on that left sideline. He threw it up and hoped that Hopkins would be able to get off of it. He did on that first touchdown, and this time against the rookie, trying to work again. You can see, you know, in college, Brock Bowers is the best tight end in college football, let alone Georgia. But here's the big man right here. Really, he's been more of a blocker in his rookie year. But he is known on critical downs in college and down in the red zone. It's 6'7", 264. He's almost like an offensive tackle. But he's got soft hands, and he's a heck of an athlete. That time they slipped him out in the flat, and he's a mismatch with that size. And the Steelers are going to take a timeout with 8.24 remaining in the third quarter. Timeout Pittsburgh with Tennessee up by three. But they've got a tough schedule coming up, including Dallas this week. Meanwhile, here after that timeout, Pickett checks it down to the outside. Harris is breaking tackles and takes it to the 26-yard line. Meanwhile, you've got T.J. Watt in the game. And coming in from the CBS studio is one J.J. Watt in attendance tonight. Most sacks to 100 games. Reggie White had 105. J.J. 87 and a half. T.J. with 87, and he still has five more games to catch his brother, which he probably will do. Chances are, yeah. Pretty cool, though, right? Very. J.J. obviously playing, and now he's retired, and now he's an opportunity to come and see his little brother play in person. At the end of the round here, this is Calvin Austin. Calvin Austin getting into the 18-yard line with 7.5 to go in the third. Now he is known for his gadget plays. Edmonds comes on the blitz, and watch the recognition here by Pickens. Teammates love to see receivers who are known for their ability to make plays and, you know, catch in the football be willing to recognize this. Sees that blitz and does a good job of not really following through on that block, almost like he was setting a screen and let Edmonds run into him to prevent that foul. Needed seven, got eight. That's a first down at the 19-yard line. Runs into a wall. That is some wall, too. That's Jeffrey Simmons. No chance there. Simmons, fifth year, Mississippi State, number one pick back in 19. Anytime you pull a guard and 98's across from you, look out. I mean, he's too quick and too explosive. And there's the big rookie tied in. He had a tough responsibility of coming down and trying to keep him from getting into the backfield. Man, he is fun to watch in the trenches. As good as there is right now. I mean, Aaron Donald's probably at a different level. But that next tier, he's one of the first names you talk about. Second and 12. Pass caught on the run. And to the 12-yard line goes Jalen Warren as Big Night continues. Gibbons makes the stop there. And here comes a big third down, third and three. They try to sneak a blitz on him, but Kenny Pickett's able to see it. Quick little hot or side adjust, just get it out to the back. I'll tell you, he's dangerous when they get him the football out there because he can make people miss and run through tackles. Hey, Mike's 37, 37. Fourteenth play of a drive that's consumed over eight minutes. To the end zone, and it's pulled in. Pickens for the touchdown. Picket to Pickens. And the Steeler fans want to see a lot more of that combo platter. I don't know if he got the left foot down. The right foot is down. The left foot is not. That's going to be an incompletion. The road on the field is an incomplete pass. The receiver did not get both feet and feet. That's the right call. Fourth down. Right. And I'll tell you, again, I'm going to give Matt Canada some props. They've been having a tough time getting George Pickens isolated. So they move him to the slot, and they get him matched up against Garrar, who's a rookie. And that's a perfect matchup. They left him one-on-one. Pickett puts it right where he needs to, and Pickens just unable to get that second foot down. Short live celebration by the Steelers. Reset the play clock to 25 seconds, please. Thank you. Clear on the replay. Nothing to look at after that. And now they have to settle for what would be a game-tying field goal. It's ability to do his job tonight. Even though he suffered an extremely painful injury to his ribs and couldn't finish the game just four days ago. Yesterday, Pickett was able to make it through a full practice, executing all the necessary throws in windy conditions. Tonight, Pickett is wearing extra padding underneath a rib protector as he tries to play through the first injury of this kind in his career. And now Pittsburgh's defense gets one all-pro back just as they lose another. Safety Minka Fitzpatrick is out with a hamstring injury, but defensive tackle Cam Hayward is back in the starting lineup for the first time since week one now. And that is very big for that Pittsburgh defense as we look at the standings. In the AFC South, Jacksonville, red hot, won five straight, 6-2. And there are the Titans trying to get to 500. Meanwhile, Baltimore leading in the AFC North at 6-2. Pittsburgh trying to keep pace to get to 5-3. Now, Leica Plique is back to receive. Pittsburgh won the toss, and they chose to take the ball. They hope to kick off for Tennessee. So most teams defer. But the Steelers want to start with the ball tonight. Interesting ball right off the bat. And with the Terrell Cowell's waving, off we go from Pittsburgh. They're going to run it back. We go Duque from the goal line. Gets stripped up at the 21-yard line. And from there, the Pittsburgh Steelers will begin. So Kenny Pickett, he was the top quarterback. quarterback in last year's draft. His number's just five TDs, four interceptions, 61% completion percentage. Trying to get that offense going, an offense that right now has been pretty inept to this point this season. Yeah, it's easy to point the finger at Pickett, but it's been a group effort. The offensive line is still trying to find continuity and get their running game going. In fact, made a change tonight up front. Start with a run. Up the middle goes Najee Harris in his third year out of Alabama. Their number one pick back in 21. Yeah, they start with Roderick Jones, a rookie out of Georgia. On the right side, Dan Moore is the left tackle. Second down, second and six. Jones, a very good pick, great prospect. Didn't give up a sack his last year in Athens. Trying to bring him in to help sure up this right side of this offensive line. We're good? We're good. Mike's right here. Mike is right. That's Allen Robinson, the motion man. Pickett looking to throw. That's knocked down at the line of scrimmage to make it third down and six. Autry, nice job of getting his hand up there. Has good length. And this is a change. Matt Canada, his entire career as a play caller, college and in the NFL, has been upstairs, but he is downstairs for the first time, as I say, not just this year, but ever. So, different perspective from him. And I think Mike Tomlin just wants to be able to have him downstairs and look the players in the eyes and help try to make the adjustments with them on the sideline. A man under fire in this town. Warren comes in to block. He's the back. And the pass is caught. That's a first down as Allen Robinson came over in a trade in the offseason from the Rams 10th year in the league. Eric Gower making the tackle there. First down for the Steelers. A little bit of confusion right here with the backers. You see on the right there, Al Shayer, he kind of gets locked up with the back. Nobody follows the crosser underneath. Good job of recognizing that, and that's a big deal. May seem like a simple thing, but a conversion on a third down for this Steelers offense with good protection, something they have not had a lot of this year. Last Sunday, their first four drives, three and out. It's already a better start tonight. Warren stays in the backfield. Warren takes the pass. Warren gets three. Nice run. Warren close to a first down behind a Darnell Washington block. The tight end helping to pave the way. It'll be second down and one. He's a big tight end. Another rookie out of Georgia. Went in doubt, right? Go to Georgia and go find a great player. He gets out in front of that. A couple good blocks by the receivers. I'll tell you, Najee Harris gets a lot of the attention. But Jalen Warren used to just be more of a third down back in his offense, now showing he can be in every down back running the football and obviously making plays like that, catching the ball to the backfield. Normally you look for a tight end, you look to Iowa, not Georgia. Second down and one. All right. There he goes to the 49-yard line. So the Steeler offense, a couple of first downs, Broderick Jones up and to lead the way that time. And left side did a great job of collapsing down. And I'll tell you, if you've watched the Steelers all year, you're a Steelers fan, you know there's not been many plays like this where you get a good. He's going to come in again. He took the right tackle spot. Now for the moment he'll take the right guard spot. He can play left guard, right guard. We see tonight he can play right tackle. Keep in mind, Andre Dillard started the first six games. He got benched last week with Petit Ferrer coming back. And then because of the injury to Hubbard at right tackle, They move Petit Ferrer over there. You've got to force Dillard back in at left tackle. Second and six. Burks in motion. Play fake. Look out. Can't spin away. The ball comes loose. Was he down? That was Marcus Golden that time. So 44. Marcus Golden. And free agent pickup from Arizona already in his ninth year in the league. Preach this sack. Petit Ferrer comes right back. First play. They get underneath by slanting and angling. He almost has another hold there. And the young quarterback's got to be careful of just trying to make a play happen by throwing that ball out of there. Again, you're getting pressure. The Steelers are going to blitz you from every different way. Good job with slanting up front. I think they caught Petit Ferrer off guard there. And they also brought to corner Joey Porter. Brunstall comes back into the game. Third down and 13. Pressure again. Wide open and making the catch at the 36-yard line. Nick Westbrook-Akine, who caught one of those four touchdown heaves last week. So pressure almost had him down in the backfield, and instead he got a 23-yard pickup. and now you've got Skoranski, the left guard, who is down on one knee at the 35-yard line. Yeah, with Minka Fitzpatrick out of that back end, you're moving some guys that are trying to replace him, and I think there's a miscommunication right here very clearly with Rush, who's just kind of out there in no man's land. I cannot say enough about the young quarterback, Will Levis, getting pressure, hangs in during the last moment, and flips that right over top of Darius Rush, who I think busted, and he picks up a first down. So there is Skaronsky, who was their number one draft pick. Picked him in front of Levis out of Northwestern. I tell you what, this team, the Tennessee Titans, over the last two and a half years, they've had 95 guys go on injured reserve. They've had 170 different players. They used 91 guys in 2021, which is an NFL record, the record you don't want to have set. So Mike Vrabel has seen a lot of this. Think about this year. They've played 31 undrafted players. It's the most in the NFL. 13 have started games the most in the NFL. Now Corey Levin, we haven't seen him. 62. He'll go in at left guard, at least for the moment. He had a first and 10 at the 36-yard line. Henry Throws his way to the 33-yard line We see players that are undrafted We get so caught up, people about the first round, second round Look what the Titans have done I just mentioned We have 31 players that have played in games this year That didn't get drafted the most of 13 players that have started games. Just unbelievable job, by the way, the culture of this organization with Mike Brable. Rand Carthen comes over as a new GM. They really develop players and find a role for them to be able to be productive. Second and seven. Henry again. Look at Mike Brable. Brable in his sixth season now with Tennessee. As a player, you think of him as a New England Patriot going to the Super Bowl, catching passes. He was a linebacker, of course, but they would throw to him. He started his career here with Pittsburgh, four years reserve linebacker under Bill Cowher, who, of course, Mike Tomlin succeeded back in 2007. I hosted him on his visit to Ohio State. That's right. You told me. Think about that. Third and three. Quick pass to the outside. making the grab and then falling down but he picks up the first down is DeAndre Hopkins. Well, there's a little confusion again in that backfield. You expect Hopkins to be lined up out on the edge. You know, one of the elite receivers. They put him in the backfield. The Steelers don't communicate. Nobody picks him up out in the flat. There's no foul on the play as the 12th defender got off the field legally. First down. Now here he is lined up in the backfield. You'll see some good push. Look at the top. You're talking about Jeffrey Simmons. You've got to work down on him, climb up to that second level, get to the linebacker, and allow these backs to get downhill. Just, again, not seeing a lot of opportunities. It's so good because it opens up different aspects of this passing game with picking. Najee Harris back in the backfield. Off play action. Pass is caught. Flag is thrown. Our first of the night for the moment. Connor Hayward is able to pick up the first down, but we'll see about the call. John Hussey is the next voice you will hear. Looks like movement there by Tennessee. Offside. Defense number 96. That penalty has declined. Result of the play. First down. Indeed. Simmons. Matt Canada downstairs. Maybe there's something to this. A little bit of a different flow, different energy so far in this opening drive. Like you said, the first quarter last week could not have gone any worse. Seven total yards in the first quarter last week against the Jaguars. Pick it under pressure and just flings it into the bench. That's on Elijah Molden. Came in from the corner on the blitz. And you've got another flag here. He had three men downfield there. That looked like it was going to be a quick screen. Just get the ball out or an RPO. But you had linemen seven, eight yards downfield. If Pickett doesn't get the ball out right away. A member of the offense. Downfield illegally, number 77. Five-yard penalty. First down. That's Broderick Jones. Yeah. So he makes a good block on one play, and then this on the next. Yeah, you get the blitz, and he wants to get this ball out right away. but look how that's taken away. At this point, he's in no man's land. You can see all the men downfield. Got a couple different linemen downfield. So by throwing that football, it's a mental error, and it costs the Steelers some momentum here. At the 42-yard line, first down and 15. Take it from the pocket, too high, incomplete. That pass intended for Deontay Johnson. Johnson is dying to find the end zone. Here's a guy. His last 113 passes, no touchdowns. Yeah, but he's open here. This may not be a touchdown but he open on a deep curl route This is the issue I think right now with Pickett is just getting comfortable That not an issue with the injury from last week That's being more consistent with the accuracy there. That's an open receiver you miss. Four-man rush. Pickett sliding left. Under pressure. Dumps it off underneath. and a big game there as Johnson makes that catch on a second and 15. Able to pick up 13 yards. It'll be third down and two. How about this by Kenny Pickett? Look at the push up the middle by Autry. They move him around from outside to inside. He wins. That's a mismatch right there with that length. Looks like a sack. There's the athletic ability. Keep the play alive. And now you're just getting your eyes downfield. You hit the check down there. And now you've got some positive yards there to Johnson. there's Levis waiting his turn coming off that four touchdown performance against the Falcons last Sunday third down and two, four minutes into the game Steelers on the move Pickett fires over the middle leaping catch made at the 10 yard line that's Deontay Johnson again Edmonds covering on the play first down, first and goal love that matchup for Pickett and the Steelers great receiver matched up against a safety that's soft off the slot there. And he really seemed to step into this throw. A lot more velocity and great accuracy. They convert there on that third down. This is the best-looking Steelers drive we've seen to open up a game maybe all year. This will be the tenth play of the drive. Two runs, seven passes to this point. Through the middle. Big hole to the end zone. Najee Harris with a touchdown. Good block going up front by the left guard, Isaac Samalo. So they elect to take the ball. Good decision, 78 yards, 10 plays. I think you and I looked at each other and said, wait, they won the toss? They're taking the ball? And maybe that's what they needed to do. But watch this left side, left guard, Samalo. Watch he gets around. This is what Najee Harris needs. Look at that. A chance for a big back to get downhill and run into the teeth of that defense. The collision there at three yards, and he runs into the end zone. Five wide in this set. Pickett, fired, caught at the five-yard line, and that's Pickett's first grab of the night. Ball spins away out of bounds. The running on the field is the runner's floor of progress was stopped before the ball was ripped out. Third down and goal. Well, red zone has been a tough spot for this offense. You know, you've got to make quick decisions, obviously, as a quarterback. But what they really need to do a better job is the continuity up front and being able to run the football. You know, we saw that on that first drive when they finished off the drive with Najee Harris punching it in. Oh. Too many in the huddle. Is that the call coming up here? Just a little discussion right now. Oh, Pagan. Paganelli, the 12-man. Yep. In the huddle. Offense. So it was going to be from the six-yard line. Now they're going to move it back. And John Hussey's been very busy tonight. The offense had too many men in the huddle. That is a five-yard foul. Five yards from the line of scrimmage. Third down. Here you go. You got an extra guy in the huddle. It's Darnell Washington. Yeah, comes in tight end. And then Najee Harris says, wait a second, we got one too many. Yeah, he knows it too. Yeah, he did. So third down and goal now. Ball back at the 11-yard line. It's 38, 38. Robinson, the motion man, resets in the slot. Picket fires into the end zone. Does Robinson make the catch? Tennessee says no and so the official. So down to the ground he goes, picks up a little turf in the helmet, and it's fourth down and goal, and they'll send in the field goal unit. They went after the rookie, Garrett, 33, in the slot against Robinson. if the ball is thrown out in front he's got a chance because there's no safety helping to the inside. He's got a chance to make a play on this right here. Good outside route but in goes inside. There's no safety there. The ball is just not able to be completed. Here's Boswell. Ninth year with the Steelers. Puts it through. 29 yards. Chipshot there. 116 to play in the first half and we are locked to 10. Especially next week. Well, Travis won't be there, but we understand Jason Kelsey off week, and he's going to show up. This is him. Meanwhile, we're going to visit about Will Levis right now. So here's a kid. You've got to love it. He did a couple of videos. He puts mayonnaise in his coffee, right? He ate a banana unpeeled. I thought this kid is crazy, but then he said it's all legit. He's got a great sense of humor. You're hoping that this is all true. Absolutely. He got a deal out of it, right? Yeah. Hellman's Mayonnaise gave him a lifetime deal to put more mayonnaise in his coffee or whatever he does with it. I tell you, man, he's a character, but he is locked in and really showing some professionalism in his approach. Hadn't he in these first couple of starts? From a 25-yard line. That's caught. And not much happening there. Spears making the grab. And Brable yelling from the sideline, go. Go, go. All three timeouts, but wants a little urgency here. A miss over the middle. Spinning away. And they're going to take a timeout as he picks up the first. And he wasn't picked on the first day, so he flew back home to Connecticut. Got home barely in time. His folks are there. His family is here. A lot of the levishes are here. And winds up being picked 33 overall as the second pick in the second round. Fires over the middle at the 40-yard line. That's caught. Kyle Phillips making that grab. So his second catch of the two about the 48-yard line. taken out right there. So Warren to go to him. Nice little one-two punch going on right now with Harrison Warren. Harris obviously known when he was coming in out of Alabama. And Jalen Warren, you touched on him a bit earlier. Not only did he go to Utah State, before that he was at Snow College for a couple years, and then Utah State, then Oklahoma State. And then he doesn't get drafted. So he's just a guy that's always had to play with a chip on his shoulder. A guy that's, when you watch him, an easy guy to root for. That's seven on that play, second down three. And that time he's stuck at the line of scrimmage. You've got Jeffrey Simmons right there with his friends. It'll be third down and short. Called Simmons' name here a little bit tonight. Al Shayer also in here. You know, he's just moving around, trying to affect that communication, uses those hands. Such great combination of skills. He's got power. He's got quicks, lateral quicks. He uses his hands. I'll tell you, Al Shire has fit in perfectly to this defense. You know, they said from the very first day that he stepped in, coming over from San Francisco, he's been a leader. Third and two. And that's caught. And across the 50. And that's the first down for Najee Harris. Tackled there by Trey Avery. Yeah, we're talking about Al Shire. He's a guy that even Levis brought up. He says, I'm learning from him. So, you know, the quarterback has really settled in with a defender there. He wants to know what his thought process is. Yeah, it's smart to pick the brain of a veteran, a fifth-year guy, that is new to Tennessee, but he's been around some great teams with Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. Pick it. Checks it down, and Harris can't handle it. incomplete, second down and ten. Ten and a half to go in the third in a three-point game. It comes down to execution and consistency. It's easy to point the finger at Matt Canada, but whether it's a missed pass or a dropped ball, all of these things add up to an offense that will take a couple steps and they'll take a step back. It's an offense that has potential, but it's an offense that's been very inconsistent all year long because of plays like that. All too familiar for the fan base. Second down and 10. Looking for room. Warren gets to the 45 and that's full. Third down. It's been fun to watch Broderick Jones today at right tackle. You know, the rookie that's making his first start of his career coming out of Georgia. They put him in at right tackle to try to just help solidify things up front. This offensive line has had some issues, not only getting a push in the run game, but protecting Kenny Pickett. But he has held up pretty nicely. College played left tackle. Tonight he's playing right tackle. 14th overall pick in the draft. Third and eight. Pickett slides, left throws, and that's incomplete and almost picked off. And there's a flag down in the middle of the field at the 33-yard line, away from the play, and the penalty is going to be against the Titans. Prior to the pass, illegal contact. Defense number 24. Five-yard penalty. Automatic. First down. It's Elijah Molden away from the play. We've seen a bunch of penalties tonight, but not only that, it seems like they've been at critical moments. Third downs and keeping drives alive. Just at the top of the route, you can see that right hand come in and grab a hold of that jersey. They pick up, again, a new set of downs. Yeah, six penalties going on. Each team, Harris, bunched up after a pickup of three for Najee. This game feels like, as we're going to go into the second half, it's like a Chuck Knoll and Jerry Glanville kind of game, you know, just like an old-school throwback AFC Central game that's going to be won or lost at the line of scrimmage, and who's not going to make that mistake to cost themselves the ball game? You can see Jerry Glanville's name all I can think of. NFL stands for not for long. Second and seven. Rolling right. Caught to the 30-yard line. Darnell Washington, the rookie out of Georgia, third-round pick. And again, Pat Friar moved his hurt, so he's inactive. And Washington has become the starting tight end. First down at the 40. Already the refuse suck. Champ comes up. We hear it in every sport now. Most popular one in hockey. From the 40-yard line, first down. Levis hit as he throws. Coming from behind, Alex Highsmith. Having a great year. Sometimes an overlooked guy, but he can play second down. And it's a mismatch on the left side with Andre Dillard, who got benched last week but is being forced to play tonight with the injury to the right tackle, Hubbard. You can see Highsmith. And we're going to talk about T.J. Watt, and we should. He's arguably the best player in the NFL, especially on the defensive side. In that discussion, the guy that gets forgotten is 56 on the opposite side. Maybe the best tandem in the NFL is Ed's rush guys. Highsmith came hobbling off after that play. So he's out for the moment on the second and 10 from the 40. Henry to the 42. You know, it's so funny with Tennessee. There was so much talk at the trade deadline. You know, would Henry go? There's Highsmith on the sideline. Would Hopkins go? Pannell, who knew? And then, of course, that result the other day may have just changed everything. Not just winning the game, like you said. Will Levis and the way he played it, it made everybody kind of perk up, including Mike Brable, like, wait a second. You know, this rookie may be giving us what we need to help Derrick Henry soften up. Everybody putting eight and nine men up, we can get the ball thrown downfield. Third and eight. Tajay Spears in the backfield here. Three receivers set to the right. Levis looks that way, then throws over the middle, and that is caught. And thrusting forward is Spears, but a little short of the first down. fourth down into one. Yeah, but half a yard to a yard here. Mike Grable didn't even blink right away. He brings in Derrick Henry. A couple more tight ends. Going with his jumbo set here right at midfield or close to midfield. Got a big physical quarterback, but they're going to direct snap it to Henry. Yeah. Number 22 will take the snap. He does. He fakes right. coming around the left side, picks up the first down. Derrick Henry needed one, got six. First down on the Pittsburgh side of the 50. Keanu Neal making the tackle. And Raider in that backfield actually helps him at the top there, 86, helps him be able to bounce this to the outside. Got just enough of Cole Holcomb. And then you can see when Derrick Henry, one of the things about him that gets overlooked, he's known for that stiff arm and his power, but he can pick up his momentum and his speed and he has a handful to bring down once he gets that speed up. Spears stays in. That was two of his first three in the air for 12 yards. Cut back the other way. Spears fighting to the nine-yard line. He goes. Rookie out of Tulane. Flag down. One rookie to another. Porter may have gotten a hold of that face mask. Face mask. Defense, number 24. That 15-yard penalty will be enforced at the end of the run. Automatic. First down. Joey Porter Jr. As that, of course, played for Pittsburgh. He also was a teammate of Levis when they were both at Kentucky. Here it is. He gets a hold of it. Fishel's on top of it again. And think about this, Al, to help not only they go for it on fourth down, there's the energy you love to see from this young quarterback. Not only did they go for it on fourth down and get it, they helped with three penalties by this Steelers defense to keep this drive alive. They're almost into the red zone. This will be the ninth play. Henry back in. From the 22. Levis. Comes back the other way to Henry. Avoids a tackle. To the 23-yard line. You know, it's such a dangerous pass. He did that a couple of times last week. In fact, he went through across the field to Hopkins for a touchdown. There was no fear. No, he doesn't. Sometimes you're just naive as a young quarterback. You're not really even thinking about what could happen. At the top on the right there, good to see Highsmith back out on the field. And then he shows the discipline right there. Once you make Derrick Henry restart, he's obviously not nearly as effective. So good job with the discipline there. Henry takes the snap again, the direct snap. To the 20-yard line goes Spears. So twice now, Henry has taken the snap. It's not that unusual. They've done it for a number of years in Tennessee. Third down here, third down and eight. Good look at Tim Kelly, the offensive coordinator, calling these plays. And one of the things that you're going to see more of with Will Levis is moving that launch point against this Steelers defense. He loves to blitz and loves to put pressure. And Terrell Austin, that's what he's thinking. You can see from the very beginning, he's moving guys around. Seeing Alex Highsmith, who's an edge guy, lining up a lot over that guard center area, trying to create any kind of confusion and pressure they can to get after Levis. Third down at eight. Play clock at one. Pressure. Levis goes down. We get the sack at the 27-yard line and another flag. It's crazy that Joey Porter looked to me that he's out as a corner over Hopkins and he jumps into his face before the snap of the ball. So instead of being a defensive end trying to get a rush, to me it looked like a corner Porter trying to jam a receiver. You don't see that very often. That was a second and 11. On the play, both by the defense. Offside, defense, number 24. Wind up in the neutral zone. That penalty is declined. Illegal use of the hands, hands to the face. Defense, number 24. That five-yard penalty includes an automatic first down. You know what's interesting here? Pittsburgh this season averaging 45 yards per game in penalties. They've had 45 yards in penalties on this drive. Yeah, and the rookie that they're hoping can give them some consistent play at corner has now has a couple penalties there on that play alone. They end up declining the offsides, but the hands to the face, we saw a face mask earlier. That was a big third down play, so now a new set of downs here for the young quarterback. Porter comes out of the game. They take him out here. From the 15-yard line. Behind the line of scrimmage. So eligible to throw it is Hopkins. He'll keep it. And DeAndre Hopkins spinning. Taking it all the way down to the 10-yard line. So it looked like a pass at first. There was nobody open. He kept it and picks up a first down. Well, you could tell he wanted to throw that football to Derrick Henry, who sneaks out of the backfield and goes down that right side on a railroad right there. It's covered. But how about our quarterback right here, Levis Ole? You know, he tried to get involved there on a block on Benton, but really a heck of an effort to get some good yards there by Hopkins. Yeah, correction. I said first down. He ran enough for a first down, but a second and five. Right. 3.20 to go in the quarter. Pittsburgh had the ball once. This is Tennessee's first drive. Henry and Spears are both in the backfield. and Levis throws incomplete into a lot of traffic. T.J. Watt, the pressure, third down and five for the Titans. Yeah, that just didn't have much of a chance at all. The red zone for them has been an issue all year long. You can see how good they've been this year. Now, keep in mind, these numbers are a little bit misleading only because with Will Levis, he brings a different skill set, not just with the big arm. He makes pretty quick decisions for a young quarterback, but also has the legs to keep plays alive and is a threat running the football. 13th play of Tennessee's opening drive. Third and five. Levis. Well, what else is new? Another flag. Down he goes. Watt knocks him down, but he got a penalty again. TJ, his brother's in attendance tonight. JJ looking on. Petit Prayer, the right tackle. He's holding on for dear life over there, right? I mean, if he doesn't get a chip or he doesn't get somebody to help him out, he's on an island against the best fast rusher in the league, and he's doing anything he can this time. Hands up in the face and pulls the helmet off. So here comes a 36-yard attempt. Fulk has made 70 straight from 40. From under 40 yards right now, he's got a 36-yard attempt. so he's been good as gold. Does he make it 71? Right down the middle. He certainly does with 2.48 to go in the first quarter. Each team has had the ball one time. Wherever. Yeah. Building up north, but after that first drive, a man who has to feel at least a momentary sense of relief. I think he's feeling good because the script he put together was executed. Really perfect way to start this game. Converted a couple third downs. Got a good mix. They're running the football, but I think it was set up by the throw. A couple big plays here from Pickett. Scrambles. Some good velocity right here. What a throw on a third down play to convert there. And then you allow the big man, Najee Harris, to get downhill. You see how he runs through those backers and safeties. So, great way to start this game for Pickett and Steelers. Running back is Warren. Give it to him. You know, the offensive coordinator always comes under pressure in a situation like this. I'll never forget. Bruce Arians was the offensive coordinator. You know, wait, they win the Super Bowl. They're in a parade, right? They won the Super Bowl. And a guy yells out, hey, Bruce, get a fullback. That's like Philly right now. They got, what, one loss, and they're ready to try to figure things out now, you know, some of their fans. But just it's a great football town, so much history and tradition, and, you know, the expectations are high. But give them credit. They have a winning record despite all their offensive struggles that they've had. Second and eight. Took it on the move. Pump fake, then a throw. Incomplete in 10-year-old Connor. Hayward, we go to Kaylee. Guys, Mike Tomlin told me pregame, We're not afraid to make a change in an effort to improve. And that is the fluid start that he wanted to see from this offense. He said, you know, when your calling plays up top, it's easy for you to communicate with the quarterback, but it's difficult for others to communicate with you. They're getting that connectivity that Mike Tomlin hoped for. Well, right now, third down and eight, upcoming for Pittsburgh, 207. Mike Tomlin, as every Steeler fan knows, no losing seasons in his 16 years at the helm. They just want another Super Bowl or two. 1-1, lost one. Deep drop by Pickett. Fires over the middle too high, and that's incomplete. Intended there for George Pickens, and in comes the punt unit. So here's an example right here where people are going to get mad at Matt Canada, and it's an open receiver that's on a crossing route here and does a good job in Pickens of separating. That ball's thrown on the money. He's running another 10 or 15 yards down that right sideline for a first down. Presley Harvin III. Steeler punching. No fair catch call for Spears. Got away with it that time. Pressure was right there. Miles Boykin in his face to make the stop as he holds it in. 153 to the quarter. This drive starts from the 18-yard line. Derrick Henry. Another flag. Petite Freyre got another penalty. Hands in the face on T.J. Watt and now the holding call. After this to the goal. First down. Yeah, he's starting in place of Chris Hubbard, who's still in the concussion protocol. Now he's hurt. Yeah, now he's down. T.J. Watt, everybody thinks about this guy's a great pass rusher, and he is. He's elite. But, look, this is how he impacts the game. Gives him an outside move, back to the inside. He's already beaten him. And the only thing Petit Ferrer can do is pull him down. So, he knows right there he wins on that play. But this is a tough loss, like you said, Al. Hubbard already down. They had moved Petit Ferrer from the left side over to the right side. That means Dillon Radins will move over in that spot. Number 75, third-year guy out of North Dakota State. Second-round pick back in 21. So just now getting up is Petit Ferrer. Second year out of Ohio State. It's first down and 19 after the penalty. And into the tent he goes. This is life in the NFL currently where offensive linemen go down and it's a patchwork job just to get through, especially on a short week. That's beating your own butt, man. We're doing that on both sides of the ball. Too many penalties on defense to stop people. You got to do a better job of communicating. Hopefully we'll settle down here in the second half. It is a short week. Sometimes it challenges you from a communication, understanding what we're trying to get done. We got to display better understanding as a collective in the second half. And when you come into this game without Minka Fitzpatrick and then you lose Cole Holcomb, Who are you depending on to have that communication locked in? No, just the strength of the pack is the pack, man. Like I mentioned earlier in the week, man, we got some new guys back there. They're new to us, but they're not new to the National Football League, man. Guys like KZ and Keanu Neal, they're not rookies. They got to do a good job of communication. All right, thank you. Kaylee? He said communicate two or three different times, and we talked about that in the first half. We knew about Minka Fitzpatrick coming in. He's not going to play. Injury to Cole Holcomb really puts a lot of pressure on that second and third level to make sure they're on the same page and not have any more busts in coverage the way we saw. Blunk three receivers to the left. All five receivers go out. Pass is not caught. Incomplete. A little behind Hopkins. And rookie quarterbacks have only beaten Mike Tomlin teams in this building. They're 1-13. That was Dak Prescott. It's because of things like this. They dial up the pressure on these young guys and see how they respond, especially with an offensive line that's had some injuries. Guys in, guys out, trying to stay on the same page. Been very impressed, despite the pressure and the way Will Levis has played and responded and also the way the offensive line adjusted and played well as that first half went on. There's a main job keeping number 90 out of the backfield. Spears is the back here. Third down and eight. Play clock at one. Levis fires. Tipped away. Incomplete intended for Hopkins. Patrick Peterson. 13th year in the league. The 33-year-old Peterson batting it away. Fourth down. Here's the first time we've seen him show that he's a young quarterback. He predetermines. And why can you not predetermine you want to throw the football to DeAndre Hopkins? with the back coming out of the backfield the first down. If he would have come off of that, he was covered, and he's thrown the ball these last two weeks when Hopkins is covered. But here, this is taken away. He's got to come off of that, check it down the spears, and they move the sticks. Ryan Stonehouse, first punt was 59 yards. This is another beauty, not only deep, but backs the receiver, Austin, into a corner, and he can go nowhere. Takes it to the 13-yard line. So I looked at this game as if before last week the Pittsburgh graph was going like this. The Tennessee graph was going like that. It all flipped last week. We need to see how we come out of this one tonight. Yeah, and the way this first half has gone, it really sets up for a second half where these teams are known to play tough. They're known to play field position, try to win the turnover margin, all the little things that typically add up to a victory. I mean, that's how Mike Tomlin's been finding ways to win despite their offense being struck. struggling in recent weeks. But against Mike Crabill's team, that's going to be tough to do, as you see here. They're starting this drive inside their own 15. From the 13-yard line, that was a 60-yard Stonehouse punt. And a couple here, Edmonds makes the stop on Harris. And I really think Matt Canada at times calls his games, and people may not agree with this or like this, but I think he calls games understanding the strength of this team is the defense, the turnover margin, field position. Let's not lose the game on offense. And I know that's a defensive mindset, but it's complementary football, and it plays to the way Mike Tomlin wants to try to win games right now. It's a small margin of error, but that's usually what wins games for the Steelers. You're working for your boss. That's the way he wants it. Second down and seven. Nice hold. Harris. Still going. Breaking tackles all the way to the 43-yard line. Najee Harris. 26 yards. Here's a good job by the offensive line. 61 Mason Cole does a good job of just kind of sealing that inside. Just helping out. Left guard's able to climb up to the backers. And again, Najee Harris, he knows what to do when he gets in the open space. I mean, think about how he played in college. He used to hurdle defensive backs coming up to get him. People were very excited about his prospect and what he could be at the next level. He just hasn't had a lot of room to work with within this offense. Jalen Warren out of the backfield. Makes the grab there, and Warren stays in bounds. A communication with the Steelers. Look at everybody trying to look at that. Without Mika Fitzpatrick, you've got a confused second and third level. He usually the guy that really helps things out Not to mention the injury to Cole Holcomb So you add Cole Holcomb and you throw Minka Fitzpatrick and you got a defense that spinning around looking at different formations and busting a little bit Big hole through the middle. There goes Henry. First down and goal. Tackled there by Casey. So a first and goal now at the 8-yard line. How about this offensive line? The much maligned offensive line. A lot of guys banged up. Corey Levin, the backup center, 62, helps out, allows the center to be able to get up there. Brewer, runs skill back. And, again, Derrick Henry, if he has a chance to get downhill, you're not going to bring him down with those arm tackles. And it takes a guy with courage to step in front of Big 22 with 250 pounds. Henry. Henry inside the five. I love the way everybody says much maligned. Nobody ever says maligned. No. Much maligned. Much maligned, yeah. Not just maligned. Tonight is very much maligned. Well, God bless them. They're still banging around out there, and it's a heck of a drive. Despite all of this, there's Micah Fitzpatrick mentioned. He is out, and we hope he's able to come back soon. but you lose a great deal of communication and one of your great leaders and versatility with so much that he brings to that back end. Halfway through the quarter. Rolling. Keeping. Gets to the two. T.J. Watt makes the tackle there, so it'll be third down and goal for the Titans. This is just, you know, I think he locked in a little bit on the outside. Okunoko, the tight end, he has Hopkins for a touchdown. If he just would have stayed with it, but I think once he came off the tight end, he just decided he's going to, you know what, I'm going to take off running instead of throwing that into the corner for the touchdown. Put a fullback in there. That's the tight end. Give it to Henry. Henry is going to try to get to the goal line. And does. Touchdown. Derrick Henry. Most impossible to stop. 73 yards, 11 plays. They got some penetration. It looked like they might have a chance to slow him down. But he runs through that collision. And, yeah, definitely knees did not touch, extends the ball across the plane. And what a drive by this Tennessee offense, 11 plays and 73 yards. Some injuries, some penalties, but they just kind of kept bouncing off of guardrails until they got into the end zone for that touchdown. Nick Falk in his 16th season in the league, spent last year with New England, puts it through to give Tennessee his first lead of the night with 6.5 to go in the first half. 10-7. Tight. Play Kansas City against the Jets. Just keep figuring out a way to do it. Five-yard line. Iguabuque. Now to the 25-yard line. Ryan Pickett has had opportunities. In fact, he started this game when they were on the script. He was five of seconds. Kenny Pickett here missing some open receivers. It's one thing to blame Matt Canada for, man, what's wrong? Why can't they design plays? It's another thing you've got to execute. This ball gets out just a little bit late and is unable to complete a big third down. That would have been a huge gain. So think about it. He starts on the script, the first 15, 5 of 7, leads them down and put points on the board. Since then, he's 0 for 4 and missing some open receivers. This drive starts with a nice Harris run. Pittsburgh's first drive was 78 yards last two drives, three plays, two yards here's Kaylee guys, I've got to catch you up on this laundry list of injuries let's start with the Titans O-line right tackle, Nicholas Petit Ferrer I'm told is questionable return because of his left shoulder when he came off the field he was emotionally frustrated at the pain he was feeling left guard though, Peter Skironski he was back on the field for that extra point then if you go on to cornerback Sean Murphy bunting with Tennessee I'm told he's a strong questionable with a right thumb injury on the Steelers D-line. Montrevious Adams, he's questionable return because of his right ankle. And Tennessee will take a timeout here. How about this? Safety's here. Phillips is right here. He's going to just kind of work, try to split them. And you've got to be able to put this ball on a line just like that over top of the linebackers, right in front of the safety. Here's, again, this arm strength that this kid has and the throw that he can make. I love that he stands in on these third downs like he's been there his whole life. Like, what's the big deal? Pre-snap to post-snap, NFL prime time. I'll make the throw, put it on the money. We're going to try to get a field goal here before we get to the half. He is an imposing presence. Kyle Phillips, meanwhile, would be their number four wide receiver. That's going to tonight. Fifth-round pick out of UCLA. first out from the 40. Tennessee has one timeout. Down the sideline. Caught and getting out of bounds. There's Phillips again. So they've got Hopkins. They've got Westbrook-Aquina. They've got Burks. And meanwhile, Phillips is having a night. Yeah, against the veteran in Peterson. What an incredible job here. Giving them a good nod there at the top of the route. And I just cannot believe how Will Levis is standing in there. Obvious passing situations. Everybody wanted to see, okay, we saw him throw a lot of quick throws and a lot of deep throws. What about the intermediate throws? Can this kid make those NFL tough throws against this defense? Alex Smith and T.J. Watt, he's doing it right here. He'll try to get, again, at least a field goal, maybe a touchdown. 12 out of 15 for 153. He's going to go for the six. You've got action going on right there, and you've got Hopkins right there, and the official right there as well with Joey Porter. Second down. And I think the Steelers reacted because Hopkins, great position. Give the rookie Joey Porter a lot of credit here. Again, he's working, working, working. Look at Hopkins using his hands there to try to get around him. Ball is uncatchable, so no call. Second and ten. Again to the end. Oh, it's overthrown just a little bit. He's backing up that time. Spears had his back to the goal line. Started to lose his balance. could not hold it in third and ten. Remember, you've got Spears sliding out of the backfield. You've got pressure right here from the linebacker. Now he's got to try to get into coverage. He thinks he's got help behind him. And, again, we don't have Cole Holcomb in there. You don't got Minka Fitzpatrick. Again, another example of losing a receiver, in this case a running back. He did a great job on T.J. Watt that time, forcing him to the inside. Going to keep it on the ground here, So they're going to settle for the three, apparently, as Spears gets stopped at the 19-yard line. It's fourth down. They start on their own 25-yard line, and the rookie makes a couple big throws there and gives them a chance. Here's Charles London, the quarterback coach, who's done such a great job with Will Levis. To be to the point where he is, where we're watching him, He's in the back, you know, in the shadows of this offense when Tannehill was healthy. And to see what he's been able to do to prepare himself to get ready means that he and Charles London have put in a lot of time when nobody's watching to get him to the point where he's ready to go these last couple weeks. Didn't you think they were going to take one more shot? I thought they would. Yeah, I did. With the way he's throwing it. Yep. Said Nick Falk will attempt a field goal. 36 yards. he's already made a 36 yarder tonight so does Tennessee go to the locker room with a three point lead they do end of the first half Tennessee 13 Pittsburgh 10 State Farm halftime show after the break watching around the country saying with an eyebrow raised. Wow, this kid's showing something tonight. Well, anybody who saw that game on Sunday against the Falcons came away with the same feeling. This is a short kick. And a fair catch is called for. He'll come out from the 25. Kaylee with Mike Tomlin. Well, Coach, you got seven on the board fast, but only three points since. What do you want to see from your offense in the second half? You know, we've just got to be smarter and cleaner. You know, 12 in the huddle, man, that's just. Of course, Cole Holcomb has been ruled out, guys. Thank you, Kaylee. That's the first down there. Gain of a couple out to the 35-yard line with five and a half left in the half. Yeah, you get to November, and this is where teams get banged up. You know, you want to make a run, and the championship teams do in November and December. You've got to overcome adversity. I mean, I know it's a corny saying, next man up, but it's real. And the teams that go on to get to the postseason, the next man steps up, and you figure it out. Line up in the pistol for the first time tonight. To the outside. That pass is caught. Nice move there. And working his way all the way close to a first down is Deontay Johnson. Nice to see what he can do after the catch. You know, he got off to a little bit of a slow start in their game last week. Had a couple drops. And I think it maybe impacted his confidence. Good to get him going. so much attention on George Pickens from this Titans defense. He's going to have to win, not just downfield, but making plays after the catch as he did right there. Second and two. Play fake. Caught to the outside again. There goes Deontay Johnson to the 50-yard line. You have that run pass option, and if he sees the blitz, which they end up bringing Elijah Molden, then you can get the ball out. Blitz comes from right here, so now you've got a safety that's deep. Get the ball out in a hurry. Give him a chance, and you've got a blocker in front. It's a good job of recognizing that good block by Allen Robinson and positive yards for that first. Pickett 7 of 13. Four of those have gone to Johnson. Pickens has not caught one tonight. Only had one last week. Turned out to be a touchdown. Pickett under pressure and bounces that one incomplete. And now a flag comes in as Pickett goes to the ground. You had Tyre Tartt and Jeffrey Simmons were both there. And the crowd knows that's going to be a personal foul. Personal foul. Ruffing the passer. Defense number 98. 15 yards. Automatic. First down. But again, it's not, again, that they're hitting him necessarily late. It's that they follow through. This one, it looks like it's Simmons. When you come all your weight down on top of these quarterbacks, you're going to get called for it. We can all disagree with it, but that's the rule, so it's going to get called. And Tartt was there as well. It's only 600 pounds coming down. Warren is the running back. inside handoff on a room, Warren inside the 20 yard line goes Jamlin Warren the second year back out of Oklahoma State the right tackle making his first start Broderick Jones, watch this block right here, that it actually allows Warren to be able to get out right behind that block, he does a nice job of breaking that tackle tell you, you don't think of him necessarily as the physical back with Harris back there, but he sure is with that low center of gravity. 5'8", 215 pounds. Undrafted free agent. 21-yard line. Again, Warren around the corner. Sets up a first down and goal. Edmonds making the tackle inside the 10-yard line. Spotted at the 8th first down and goal. Edmonds comes here, and ideally he would come out here and help set this edge. He gets inside, and that gives Warren a chance to bounce that. Now again, Edmonds just has been here about a week and a half coming over from Philly and a Kevin Byer trade. Takes a poor angle and that allows Warren to bounce that outside for even more yards. Put it down to the 7 yard line. Harris back in. Harris nothing. Stuffed at the line of scrimmage. 2.20 to go. in the first half. Just to remind folks that Matt Canada, as you say, the much maligned Matt Canada. You said that. He is down on the field for the first time in his coaching career. College. I've known him for a long time. He's always been upstairs. They made a switch and seeing if it can help spark this offense. Working on the first drive, working on this one as well. Second and goal. When we come back. Second down and a goal. Harris split wide to the right. How many bye week before their next game? Johnson finally gets into the end zone, capping off that long drive. And the pick that winds up ending the game by Alexander in the end zone. 20-16, the Steelers win it. And the JCPenney postgame show coming up right after these messages. That's what the crowd was yearning for. A big play, 32 yards there. Lawrence of the night. Warren bounces off a tackle. Warren down the sideline. Does he get into the end zone? Tennessee says no, and the officials are going to mark the ball at the one-yard line. First and goal. I mean, I know we're going to focus at the end of the play, but are you kidding me? The effort and what he did. He steps out of bounds right there at the one-yard line. But how about the play? The rookie right tackle, Broderick Jones, making his first start, gets blown up there by the vet, Jeffrey Simmons, and instead of giving up on it, he spins around and gets to the edge with that quickness and that physical style of running that he has. Almost takes it to the end zone. Amani Hooker saved the touchdown at least for the moment. It's a first down and goal. Drive started back at their own 8 yard line. Havers in the backfield. Najee new stopped at the line of scrimmage. Every yard a tough yard here. Second down and goal. What do you expect? Of course Jeffrey Simmons slips a gap and gets into the backfield. Makes a play. Here we go. Tough to run the ball against his defensive line. Four and a half left in the fourth. Pick it out of the pistol. and now he leaves a direct snap and you got a flag before the play as Danico Autry is right there so a little trickery and it doesn't work James Daniels moves and you go to that Wildcat down inside the two yard line and it affects the operation the cadence and the rhythm offense under 78 five yard penalty second down Yep, that's Daniels I mean, you know We're seeing this more and more now You go trickery and deceit at the one yard line Yeah, the linemen, they're just antsy They're wanting to get out Especially if you're pulling the way Daniels was there And you're waiting to motion Can he pick it out? And then the direct snap And just the timing is off So now you go five wide on the second and goal And pick it Fires, and that's going to be dropped at the one-yard line. So, Deontay Johnson, at least a flag comes in for a likely interference on the defense. So, Johnson thirsting for that end zone. Now you've got a hold here. Allen Robinson has a heck of a collision with Garer, but he pulled him down. Defense number 33. Tennessee's have to get the two-goal. Automatic. First down. Eric Barr, the rookie out of Louisiana. Watch him pull the jersey and bring him down. Pretty clear. Yeah, very clear. Robinson, if he doesn't have to grab onto that jersey, it would have been interesting to see if the call would have gone the other way. Trying to set that screen to get this quick slant underneath it. So now we're back to a first and goal, but this time from the three. Pickett to the end zone. Touchdown, and there it was. Deontay Johnson finally gets into the end zone. Deontay Johnson had 119 consecutive receptions without a touchdown. He finally gets in. I wonder if he remembers how to do the celebration. You know who the last quarterback was to throw him a touchdown pass? The big man. Ben. Oh, yeah, Ben. Yeah. That's how long it's been. I thought it might have been Terry Bradshaw. Big extra point coming up to make Tennessee have to go all the way for a touchdown. Extra point is good. Chris Boswell boots it through. We've got 4-0-2. Left in regulation in the Steelers with a flag down, a little pushy shoving. Kissy face going on. And after that, Meele Johnson finally. Chris Boswell. Who did one from 29? This one from 30. and now we're tied at 13 541 that close but no cigar one foot in the other clearly out 13 on that's a new thing for Matt Cannon down the sideline actually sitting next to his quarterback and being able to communicate face to face part of the reason he's down there tonight for the first time Fair catch call for it. New rule this year. Ball comes out to the 25. Well, the Steelers have dialed up the pressure, and of course it's been by T.J. Watt, not only against the dropbacks, but also impacting the run game. And then when the quarterback does drop back to throw, he's just so quick off the ball. That first step gives him such an advantage. You can see the hands and how he uses the hands to his advantage. I'll tell you, all things considered, this offensive line, When they've been ISOed, they've held up pretty well for the most part, but they've been chipping him and doing everything they can to try to give their quarterback a chance. First play of the drive is a Henry run of four yards. Derrick takes it out to the 29-yard line, second down and six. Yeah, we keep talking about these two teams, their two head coaches, their approach, how they try to win games. Just got another injury, it looks like, with the Titans. Dillard left tackle. I think he may be the only guy that hasn't gone down yet tonight with an injury. A lot of guys have had to go down, and they've fought back to continue to play. What I was going to say is both these teams want to win. They want to get it into the fourth quarter. It looks like Jalen Duncan, the rookie, will have to come into the game. And here we are 13-13 with five minutes to go in the third quarter. Delroyd five years ago, a first round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles. Ooh, and that's the shot he takes. Landon Roberts just swinging around. Good to see his walk. He looks pretty good coming off there. Under his own power for the moment. Duncan is a rookie, met a Maryland, picked in the sixth round. second down and six got a rookie at left tackle got a rookie at left guard and Skaronsky the number one pick and a second down and six here Levis stepping up Levis coming back this way Hopkins is there incomplete he has no fear throwing it across the field he really does it Aaron Brewer is just trying to do the best he can as a center, peeling back. Watch the center snap the ball, and then he's got to peel back and deal with Highsmith, who's as good as there is at putting pressure on a quarterback. Now, we saw throws like this last week from Levis. Not quite enough as DeAndre Hopkins works hard to come back to that football. Third down and six. crowd now at full throat as Levis surveys spins away the other way heading backwards and has to throw it away I think you're going to get defensive holding another flag here and if it is it's obviously a first down for that Titan defense with like a little bit of a rest here the last thing they wanted was a three and out illegal contact defense number 20 five yard penalty automatic first down Patrick Peterson we've seen this a couple times he's matched up with Chris Moore here in the slot But, boy, as a veteran guy, he's looking for any kind of shortcut he can get to help him out in his 13th year. And second or third time we've seen him wrap up and hold. Easy call for the official. Yeah, Chris Moore, a guy who hasn't even been thrown to tonight. Henry makes the most of that. And then he is tripped up. Big tackle there by KZ. Or he might have been off to the races. As it is, he still is able to pick. He knows he has to account for him and gets the ball out quickly. Guy is really just growing up right before our eyes here, making his second start of his career. I mean, they can only hope in Tennessee. Ryan Tamahill, you know, who knew or knows what happens to him next year. This keeps up, though. They've got the quarterback. No doubt about it. and he brings not only the arm strength, but he brings poise, command, physicality with his size, and confidence. And I think the rest of the team kind of plays off of what he brings from an intangible standpoint to this team. Very much like when Ryan Tannehill took over for Marcus Mariota, he brought that kind of energy as well. Came from Miami. Meanwhile, you've got the catch made by Connor Haywood right here. Cameron's younger brother and that should take us to the fourth quarter and will and I the confluence and we start the fourth quarter on a second down and five for the Pittsburgh Steelers and working his way up to about the 33 goes Najee Harris setting up a third down and three Najee Harris to me looks like he's running with more energy than we've seen in a number of weeks. I think it's because the Lions helping him out, giving him some room. They go no huddle here on a third down, and that's caught along the sideline by Johnson. He takes it out to the 41-yard line, so a big third down pass and a first down for the Steelers. Yeah, he's trying to figure out where Edmonds is as that flat defender. He's got to go around him, which he does. It's a very close call, but I love to hurry up there just to try to throw that in. They haven't shown a lot of it, and I think it catches Tennessee a little bit off guard. Makes that easy read and a tough throw and catch there for that conversion. I think that's the first time tonight they went no huddle. Pick a 15-24 for 122. Warren in the backfield. Warren has the ball. Warren bouncing off would-be tacklers out to the 48-yard line. And he goes, wow, what a collision with Elijah Molden. Molden has been, you know, a nickel. He's played some safety. He's got versatility. And now you've got to deal with this. It's not Najee Harris. Bang. It's Jalen Warren. He puts you right on your back. So, again, this offensive line sustaining some blocks, getting a hat on a hat, getting a good push, and let these backs do some work. Hey, Mike's two here. Mike's two. Hey. 5-8-2-15. I feel like a fire hydrant. Swing it to the outside, having to reach for it that time as Pickens. He had no chance to run after the catch. Crowd not thrilled with that call, third and seven. Christian Fulton, who has become more of a consistent player for them, especially in tackling, sometimes gives up some plays in coverage. But you can see, you know, in his fourth year out of LSU, came up there and did a nice job there against a very talented receiver, taking him down. Orange to orange. All out blitz. And Pickett has to throw it away. That's on everybody coming. Including Imani Hooker. Fourth down. They brought seven and they only have six to be able to deal with it. And I think Kenny Pickett felt that pressure. Realized right away he's got to get the ball out to his far left, Arden Key, eventually, I think, closes in on him and forces him to have to get rid of that ball. Great time to throw that blitz if they bring one too many. The regally named Presley Harvin III in the punt. Short punt. That's going to stay in bounds and turn out to be a decent punt. So it never skids out of bounds. Instead, it gets down to the 8-yard line. You've got a flag down. What else is new? There is no foul on the play. Time out. They just used to throwing flags anyway. What can I tell you? It's down by three with 12 and a half to go. And the crowd roaring. Tennessee has the ball in its own eight-yard line beginning this drive. With play action. A lot of time to throw. finally the open man is caught there by Traylon Burks and that quiets the crowd in an instant. Let's get Tim Kelly to play caller and offensive coordinator again a lot of credit we saw it earlier you go to 12 personnel with one back Derrick Henry they're going to run backed up inside their own 10 they go play action look how that helps the offensive line quarterbacks able to throw in rhythm takes time for that that route to come all the way across the field and a heck of a That was the loudest this stadium has been. Backed up again deep. And the young kid steps up and makes a great throw. And the 21-yard pass stilled the crowd. Medano a hush. And they're trying to get back up. Help that defense. Called the 29-yard line. Henry. Now let's take a look at our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. Look at Will Levis tonight, burst to blitz. He's 7-12. No blitz when he's been seeing a lot more zone. You would think that that's tougher for a younger quarterback, but at 9-12, 132 yards, you have to be able to read and make good decisions. I'll tell you he's done that, especially when he's had time to be able to read that coverage. Turned a lot of poise again this second start. Second and six. Henry spinning and should have enough of the first down. That's where they spot it. And they will move. The change here, first down. The guy that's got to be the happiest about Will Levis and the threat of the downfield passing is this offensive line, and especially 22. You're talking about now, these linebackers are not quite as quick to get downhill because of play action, shots downfield, makes them sit back, have to navigate, make a good decision before they just aimlessly take Derrick Henry out of this offense. 16 carries for Henry, 74 yards on the ground. Play action. Look out from behind. He has to sling it away. It's incomplete. Feeling the pressure from behind. Alex Highsmith. Again 22 You heard Hussey say eligible receiver in the area No grounding Second and ten You used to seeing T Watt on one side and Highsmith on the other but now you seeing him move around He lined up right next to Highsmith, and then as the ball is about to be snapped, he's moving around. So had them both on the same side. That is really tough on that left side of that offensive line. Quickly out here. Spears. He gets to the 41-yard line. Landon Roberts in on the tackle. Third down. They're just trying to get away from that pressure. Just get it out quickly to Spears. Get the offensive line in front of him. Give yourself a chance here on third down. We're watching that live. I thought T.J. Watt almost got a hand on that football. I think he was expecting that quick throw and came very close. with a sidearm shot there, third down and eight. Nine and a half left in regulation. Crowd wanted a flag for a false start. Don't get it, but the pass is incomplete. Tend of a spirit. It sure looks like there was a false start, but it wasn't called. The crowd was already into it. Yeah, I was with you. You see, they walk everybody up playing press, man, and then a safety comes down here. He's going to have to account for the back that leaks out of the backfield. He's right there. Even if he catches that, that play doesn't have a chance. Yeah, Dillard could have been flagged, but wasn't. Pass incomplete. Meanwhile, Stonehouse, two punts, averaging 60 yards a punt. The guy who broke Sammy Baugh's 82-year-old record last year. This one, a little end-over-end job. Pick up a first down, get some positive yards. Now they flip the field, put the Steelers at their own eight. So, very important. See what happens here with Pickett. From the eight-yard line, they start this drive. Nice hold there. and Najee Harris there number 22 picks up 7 yards second down and 3 he just looks like a different back tonight to me he looks like what you'd expect to see from a 6'1 242 pound back and I think as Warren continues to come on and compliment him it keeps his legs fresh but the most important thing what a drive that was 92 yards 11 plays the extra point was good unsportsmanlike conduct number 77 Pittsburgh. That penalty will be enforced on the kickoff. Time out. It's Broderick Jones. All right, 4-0-2 to play in Pittsburgh. And the Steelers on top. 2016. back to Pittsburgh where Deontay Johnson just scored his first touchdown since week 17 of 2021 and he told me just yesterday he knew this moment would come he admitted that the touchdown drought last season was tough for him to cope with but after a year of it Johnson wouldn't let himself get frustrated over it anymore. He told me he's been focusing on moving the chain and winning his route, but you know this one feels good, guys. Interesting. Tonight, he's been the main man without question. Seven catches, 90 yards. Meanwhile, Pickens has caught two for minus one yard. And because of the penalty now, he got the kick coming from all the way back at the 20-yard line. Spears bounces his way up to the 48-yard line. That is a big deal, that penalty and a heck of a return. Let's look at another next-gen stats powered by AWS. And what a night for Alex Highsmith. Look at these eight pressures on 23 pass rushes himself. And what really stands out is the consistency of what he's done this entire year. Seven-plus pressures, four of eight games. That's tied for the most in the NFL with Micah Parsons. So T.J. Watt gets a lot of attention, a lot of double teams, a lot of chips. A lot of times Alex Highsmith is left one-on-one, and he sure takes advantage of it and has done it again tonight. Now we'll see what Levis does coming from behind. Last week he had the lead in that game against Atlanta as the Falcons try to catch up. Now it's his turn. A little razzle-dazzle here, and forced to the outside, and skirting the sideline is Traylon Burks. The call here to get this drive started. Everything on the table. Reverse, trying to get an overly aggressive defense flying and losing the edge from the backside. They pick up some positive yards here. I mean, this is probably what Will Levis has dreamt about his whole life. Right, I mean, here he is, big stage, Steelers in Pittsburgh and a chance to go down and try to take the lead against the Steelers down four. That was again a five-second down, five. Titans have all their timeouts. Plus the two-minute warning. Ton of time. Henry gets stuck. Landon Roberts is right there to take him down. He celebrates. It'll be third and fourth. And that's what he brings to this defense is that downhill mentality, the more physical of these linebackers. And with Cole Holcomb out in this game, Quan Alexander and Landon Roberts have got to make plays against this run game. And you saw 50 all over it there. crowd roaring there's what he circled him hand the ball off nothing to the 45-yard line spears tackled there by patrick peterson So now you've got a fourth down and four. And Rabel keeping the offense out there. There's Patrick Peterson in his 13th year. Again, it keeps staying with Mika Fitzpatrick out. That's normally his role. Others have had to step up. And there, it's Peterson, the veteran. Two and a half. Clock running down. Fourth and four. Levis. Going for it all down the sideline and threw that one out of bounds. Birch was there. He's down, and they'll turn the ball over with 2.06. Well, I think everybody thought that they'd try to get the ball to DeAndre Hopkins. And he's completely taken away with a double team. So he has to take a chance downfield. I think he went with the matchup, went after Levi Wallace. Pretty good coverage there. Wallace has had some tough moments this year. So they tried to pick up a first down. Good job here of just that little sidesteps allows him to keep his acceleration. and a heck of a job in the interior there with Aaron Brewer and Peter Skaronski, a double team, able to get up to the backer. Boy, he almost got out of there. Inside handoff to the 48 Spears there. Kaylee, what's going on? Guys, left tackle Andre Diller just snuck back on the field for that last play. When he came off earlier, he got a pretty quick tape job over his right shoe and up supporting the ankle, tested it out a bit, and ran right back on. Half those guys, all those guys tonight ended out at one point or another. Again, we've got to continue to talk about this offensive line, not only the injuries, but the way they're blocking now, especially late in this third quarter. Great block by Aaron Brewer on that last play. Second down and four. Look out. Gets it away. And it's caught there, Henry. And Derrick Henry. Alex Highsmith came in that time. And Derrick Henry, what a move by Levis. What a play. As it turns out, it looks like he's dead in the water. The next thing you know, you've got a 23-yard pickup. He looks this off and doesn't realize on his blind side this. Like at the last split second, he realizes that Highsmith's on him. And somehow the strength of Will Levis allows him to get that ball over the defense and into the hands of Derrick Henry. From the 25. Henry, gain a one. 14th carry tonight for him. 64 yards on the ground. And he's caught three for 27. Watching these Titans, you know, you think about Derrick Henry. You're going to run the ball. You're going to be physical. That's the thing that got overlooked last week. Everyone didn't want to talk about Will Levis and his four touchdowns. Derrick Henry had 101 yards rushing. So what I think Mike Brable likes about this offensive potential is running the football and then to be able to take shots downfield with Will Levis. is a great complement to who they are and kind of the DNA of this offense. So, Braverly, one of the play clock we've set. Two minutes remaining in the quarter. Spears is the back, second and nine. Pressure. Gets it away. Caught. And that's Burks, and he's taken down right away at about the 23-yard line. Pressure that time. blitzing from the secondary was Chandon Sullivan. Now you'll love this. You talk about the command that you saw from Will Levis last week. Look at this. He recognizes this blitz right away. He's adjusting the protection. He knows he's got to account for that blitz. Now I've got to get the ball out of my hands because the linemen aren't going to pick it up, get it out quick. He's falling back all arm on this throw. So the recognition against a blitzing defense to know where he needed to make that read and get the ball out quickly gives him a chance here. Third down, seven. Big to the left. Trying to set up a screen, but the Steelers are right there. Spears makes the catch. You've got T.J. Watt, and you've got Cam Hayward. That's a pair to draw to right there to stop them. Fourth down and 15. Just too much penetration. They're not able to sell this screen at all. See Cam Hayward there on the inside. He senses it. You know, the veteran, the experience that he has, but Nick Herbig also applied that pressure and forced Will Levis to have to get that ball out quicker than he wanted to. So here's Falk to try to give Tennessee the lead again. This from 48. He's made a pair each from 36. And he is still as good as ever in his 16th season in the NFL. The Tennessee Titans in the waning seconds of the third quarter lead, The Pittsburgh Steelers, 16-13 on Thursday Night Football. Highline with Charles London. This is prime vision machine learning. Shows you the threats that the quarterback might be feeling. Doesn't necessarily mean they're coming. It just means the threats of a blitz and where that pressure may be. This time, the AI is correct in diagnosing where the pressure comes from. And so is Will Levis. He sees that Solomon may come as you're seeing some continuity within this offense tonight with a mix of the run and the pass and the line playing much better. Harris. Steelers have a first down. Picked up three. If you've watched him try to run the football this year, especially when you expect that their personnel grouping and the down in the distance would tell you it's a run. They're getting hit at the line of scrimmage. Tonight, I think Mike Tomlin, he and his staff go back and look at this film. They're going to be very happy. Maybe the addition of Broderick Jones and these guys, maybe they found the right combination up front, but they played much better. Eight minutes left in the fourth. to the outside. That's hold in there. That's Myles Boykin making the catch. Being of six yards, second down and four. Canada having Kenny Pickett be patient. You know, this is, not only is it a game of field position, but this is the point in the game where it's seven and a half minutes and you're down three. You cannot afford to make the critical errors, especially down here. Running the football, positive yards on first and ten. Then a turnover free game. Inside hand on. Fighting. Can he get the first? He's about a yard shy. That's Warren. Picked up two or three extra yards after initial contact. Third and one. How great is this? Two coaches that pride themselves in toughness. The line of scrimmage. Both of them said, how are we going to win this game? The line of scrimmage. We've got to be tougher. Here we are at a 16-13 game, which is very predictable. And we've got a third and one late in a game like this. This is fantastic. Yeah, Brable thinking, man, I've got to win a road game. One of these days. They have not won a road game in 50 weeks. The last road game they won was in Green Bay on a Thursday night last November. Taking it on the end of the round. To the 41-yard line, that's Warren. Jalen Warren. Well, you're used to seeing Calvin Austin on these gadget plays. Short yardage, they kind of sneak him over here and pick up a couple good blocks by the tight ends, Hayward and Williams. And you're not going to be able to bring him down with an arm tackle. Jack Gibbons just a step slow. Good timing there to get the football to him right when he's able to get it And then get to the edge with that speed and quickness. Nine carries. He's averaging seven yards a carry. Harris back in on a first down. Pickett. A little too high intended for Johnson. And incomplete. Second and ten. In the winter of this game, you know, you go into the second half of the season. If it's Tennessee, you got your quarterback. You know, you were 2-4 going into last week. If you're Pittsburgh, you're going, oh, hold on a second here. Absolutely. You know, and look within their divisions, especially the Steelers, with what Cincinnati's doing. They're getting hot with Joe Burrow healthy. The Ravens and Lamar Jackson. Trying to keep pace with the Ravens. There's the handoff. After the 45-yard line, it's Harris. So once again, you've got a third down. Everyone critical right now third down and let's go at six You could hear some of the murmurs I don't know if they liked that that play call there on that second ten after they didn't convert on that first down that ball Just a little bit behind Johnson It's a big difference between third and one and in round to an end round of jail and worse Third now and in six Pick it down the sideline It's caught Johnson Deontay Johnson Skirting the sideline On a third down and six He hits them for 32 And they go right after Trey Avery Sean Murphy Biding out, man free Third and six Take a chance, late hands I think that's what gives Johnson a chance is he eyes the football, but the hands didn't come up. So Avery, who's beat, doesn't have a chance to react to those late hands by the vet. Johnson makes a heck of a play. What a throw there by Pickett. Yeah, that's a pick on that. But watch Hopkins on the crosser against the rookie Porter. Not only does he have to deal with Porter, but Neal, 31, comes down too. So they leverage him and take him out of the play. So he tries to find that matchup against Levi Wallace. Burks down, injury timeout back after Burks and Kaylee, you're down there what have you seen? Al, just as I went running to trail on Burks as he went down, people were yelling for the cart to get to him as fast as they could what we've seen has been standard protocol, he was log rolled onto his back, put onto that sturdy spine board and strapped down his face mask was removed the crowd is cheering for him now We just saw him move his toes for the first time after he was loaded onto that cart, but I did not see him open his eyes out. Okay, obviously we will get word as soon as we get some word. Number 76, this report is eligible. Number 76, this report is eligible. I think the crowd reacting to him giving the thumbs-up sign over on that far sideline from us over by Kaylee. there was a thumb at least the left thumb is up Mike Rabel watching and play resumes 2-0-6 left in regulation after they turn the ball over on downs Pittsburgh now has the ball at its own 47 yard line Tennessee all of its timeouts plus the clock will stop at the two minute warning Meanwhile, stuffed in the backfield and taken down there. And that will take us to the two-minute warning is Najee Harris. Tackled by Thierry Tarp. Two-minute warning and will return to Pittsburgh in 30 seconds. You would think that's the conventional wisdom, but who knows these days. Harris is the running back. And they run the end around again, but not much there. Calvin Austin. He gets taken down, and Tennessee takes. If you're going to potentially throw it, maybe you do it on second down to maybe surprise them. On third down with his defensive line and their ability to rush to quarterback. You know, if you're Matt Cannon, are you gun shy? Are you afraid to make a terrible mistake? Absolutely. Make him drive the length of the field. Yeah, third down and ten. And that will take the ball to the 50-yard line. It's out of a fourth down. That's Warren. Go back to our open. We talked about trying to learn how to get back to winning, right? It's about winning the surest way, which is putting the football here. So that's the second time out. Look at some of this weekend's what they call thrilling matchups presented by Nissan. Some big games, Miami and Kansas City going all the way to Frankfurt. 9.30 a.m. Eastern. on the NFL Network. Dallas and Philly is the Fox late game. Sunday nighter, Buffalo at Cincinnati. Bengals now red hot chargers. Jets is the Monday nighter. Here's the punt by Harvin. And a fair catch is grabbed at the 15-yard line by Garer. So Tennessee has one timeout, 144. And they have to go 85 yards. And we've seen Levis. We've seen his big arm. We've seen his athleticism and his strength. Even his anticipation, how smart he's been. Now it's a chance for him to go be a hero. I mean, it's a tough ask. It's his defense and the way they pressure the quarterback. When they know that you're going to throw the football with 90 and 56, let's see how they protect him. Let's see if they can get separation with their receivers. And let's see what Will Levis can do. You had Hopkins and Wallace locked up. One-on-one. Levis was fired down the left sideline. Almost picked off at the very end there. It's Hopkins playing defensive back with Wallace. Hey, that's the best play Hopkins has made in a while, right? He's going back probably to high school days at Daniels High School in South Carolina. I don't think he's played DB in a while. This is a heck of a job because Wallace's eyes are on the football. Great job by Wallace on that, but Hopkins saves the day by knocking that away. Hopkins does not have a catch in this half. They've targeted 11 times. He's caught only four tonight. Levis hangs in the pocket. Fires caught. That's going to be a first down to the 28-yard line. Catch made there by Kyle Phillips. He's got to hurry here. Ball's got to get out quick because I respect how he sits in that pocket. But with that pass rush collapsing, ball's got to come out. Four catches for Phillips tonight. Levis under pressure, swallowed up at the 18-yard line. He had such composure to want to sit in that pocket. And under these circumstances, with only one timeout, just can't take the sack. Got to be a little bit quicker with his decisions, getting the ball out. Just throw it away. There's your final timeout. Got to take it. You got a minute and 17. No chance. Yeah, not just Highsmith and Watt, but as we've seen most of this night, I'll tell you, Keanu Benton, the rookie, he's had a big night rushing the quarterback, giving him a great push in the middle. Now you're out of timeout, so. Second and 18. Got to go 81 yards. rush forward drop seven levis buys time throws underneath that's caught and then pick up a few extra yards to the 30-yard line goes chick a quantum complete the tight end third down third eight hopkins lined up off to his left against the rookie joey porter and that's one hop and incomplete over the middle comes down to this 53 seconds fourth down this is true to form for the Steelers a lot of fourth quarter comebacks will this be another one Now or never on this play. And timeout taken here by Pittsburgh. This will be a 30-second timeout. Well, you get these guys out of Nashville. Yay! As we mentioned before, haven't won a game on the road since Green Bay on a Thursday night. last November. This was a team that was 7-3 last year and collapsed down the stretch. Jacksonville won the division. It's incredible when you think about Mike Conlin's formula to victory and how they hang around and keep it close for three and a half quarters, find a way to win it in the fourth quarter. Might not be a beauty contest, but it's all about the W's. He's pointing a walk right here, not on the edge, but in the middle. Next command comes. Levis throws. Incomplete, and that's going to wrap it up. Unless there's a flag, and of course there's a flag. Yeah, late flag. At the 36-yard line. I thought at the top of the route that Porter locked up with Hopkins, and I think that's what they're going to call. Tomlin saying, hey, it was tipped. John Hussey Holding Defense number 24 5 yard penalty It didn't matter the ball's tipped Because the holding occurred Before the ball was out Watch at the top of the route He works towards us There's the grab of that jersey And we've seen this battle all night We've also seen that play A million times too It doesn't always get cold but the game moves on 49 seconds from the 35 yard line still alive little shoulder shake pass too high, incomplete 10 to 10 time for Chris Moore second down, second and 10 Pittsburgh wants to do everything they can to take away Hopkins as that thread and make Will Levis find other options, whether it's Moore, whether it's Westbrook, Akine, anybody other than Hopkins. That's why they're using safeties to help out on him. Open. Caught. To the 36 goes Chris Moore. So Chris Moore gets into the action. That's his first catch of the night. 29-28. He's going to spike it here. Stop the clock with 26. Well, here we go again. Here we go again. You know, they use Phillips here, believe it or not, from the slot to clear out. And watch what this does to the Steelers' defense. They're, of course, worried about the deep ball, the threat of the deep ball. Safety here, safety here. And because they're so deep, the crosser right underneath Phillips, in front of those safeties, opens up. It took patience that time by Will Levis, but he shows you again. The accuracy and the arm strength on that throw, and a good job up front giving him the time. block comes inside for his rush to the outside goes the pass caught getting out of bounds now to stop the clock well quant will put two on this drive 20 seconds and they'll spot the ball at the 24 yard line Is this kid showing any moxie here tonight or what? He's dealing with some backup offensive linemen. He's dealing with T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith. This defense is just trying to get hands on that football. They're trying to get that big turnover. They thought they were off the field until that defensive holding on Porter. Hopkins and Porter matched up. Levis throws in the end zone and it's almost picked off and that would have ended it Darius Rush, rookie out of South Carolina free agent almost ended the game took 4 seconds off the clock we're down to 16 and Rush is just playing center field he's just sitting right here reading Levis' eyes looks one way, comes back and he almost timed that up perfectly stepped in front of it He just has to secure the football and the game's over. Trying to go to O'Connor again. Second down and 10. 16 ticks. Levis, shoulder shake. To the 19-yard line. That stops the clock. 11 seconds to go to the tight end again. O'Connor. Third down. It's crazy how he's one of these guys that has that ability to fall backwards and just flip it with his, you know, that wrist. It's just a flip. And he's got still so much velocity on the ball, he's able to throw it on a line. Well, we saw last week's game, Tampa Bay-Buffalo ended with an incomplete pass in the end zone. How does this one finish? Third and five. Levis steps up, fires, and it's picked off. Juan Alexander cements it. Well, Rush dropped a would-be game-ender, and Alexander says, not again. Great game. Great game and a great effort by both sides. He trusts his arm to make these throws. And here's another rookie right here in Wiley who's going to work to the middle. And it's just a great job by Quan Alexander in coverage. He looks left, comes back, and throws right. I think by looking left, he's hoping to draw that defense with him and just threw it on a line, hoping he could get it over top of Alexander, who's in perfect position, sinking in coverage. And that turned out to be the only turnover of the game. A kneel down will end it. Pittsburgh keeping pace a game back at Bullhorn. Tennessee drops to three and five. Steelers win it. Eight straight road losses for Tennessee. Mike Conlon has another victory. Kenny Pickett's seven game-winning drives in his year and a half as the starter in the fourth quarter or overtime. Only Kirk Cousins over that period of time has more. Back and forth. We went all night, 20-16, Pittsburgh wins it. Again, not pretty, but a W. Yeah, you find a way to win. If you're the Steelers, you're happy. You get to 5-3. I think the offense made some strides tonight. And then for Will Levis and the Titans, you know, it's his first start on the road. He's going to learn a lot, showed a lot, and I think that he's continued to try to build around what he can do to complement the running game of Derrick Henry. But a tough loss for the Titans and a big one tonight for Pittsburgh. Titans at Tampa Bay and then at Jacksonville next.
