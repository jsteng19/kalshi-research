 of the quarterback, so a nice job. Finally we see a defense get the opposing offense off the field. First punt of the night, Ryan Wright. Xavier Smith sets up inside his 25. Drifts over to the far side. Good kick. Fielded at the 9 and no room to roam. Tackled at the 13. Normally we show you Santa Monica Pier, but that's become a cliche. So tonight, Laguna Beach. That's not a bad look. Speggies, too. Puka Nakuwa. He's my brother in arms. Zero. Oh, yeah. That's when you're trying to find him on the field before the game. Andrew Whitworth told me that the other night. He had dinner with him. End of a couple here for Blake Corum. Starting on this drive. Under nine to play. Being locked at 14. Well, we saw the defense from the Rams make some adjustments that obviously helped getting the Vikings to make those mistakes. Free snap got them behind the sticks. And after a great punt, now let's see if this Vikings defense can come up with some answers. They've got Stafford and the Rams penned. Let's see if they can get this offense off the field. We're watching two of the best tonight go at it as play callers. Flag. Prior to the snap, full start. Offense, number 50. Five-yard penalty, secondary. That's Cole Limmer, the rookie center. We talked about him earlier out of Arkansas. Six-round pick. Yeah, just a flinch by the center. You know, you imagine being a rookie in a game like this against this defense. He's worried about a lot of things. It's protection sliding left, sliding right. He just moves slightly there. Good call by the umpire to make that proper call to push the Rams back even further. Cup with blocking. Gets out to about the 13-yard line behind a block from Colby Parkinson. So the Rams now with a third down and nine. Come up without a huddle. Three-man rush. Stafford, look out. Avoids the safety. He started to stumble. He got another flag here. There is no foul for a tickle ground. Eligible receiver in the area. There was. Kyron Williams was in the area but the pressure was put on, he started to stumble Illegal hands in the face Defense, number 52 Five yard center, automatic touchdown So that's the third time the Rams have had a third down and the Vikings have handed them a gift Absolutely It's Ward right in the middle of this defense, going up against again, we keep talking about the center he gets double teamed and the left hand gets up into the face at first you heard him come on and say there's no foul for for a intentional grounding and then there's a great look at Ward getting up into the face of this center. Good call. So you're getting your right. Rams catch a break. Three times. Halfway through the quarter from the 17. Coram is the running back. Give it to the Michigan rookie. up to the 22-yard line he goes. This kid bounces off of tackles. I mean, he's 5'8", about 210 pounds. I think he compliments Kyron Williams in this system and what they want to do. Has a, sir, yes, sir, may I have another kind of mentality as a running back. So looking to prove himself and will run with a great deal of energy and passion any time he gets a chance. He already saw the pass pro that he had earlier that helped Stafford out. movement again this time on the right side looked like 87 Davis Allen full start offense number 79 5 yard fielding secondary I think 87 responded to Havenstein the vet everything has been so flawless right for both of these offenses and then third time for both sides making mistakes. Hard to keep up that pace at the beginning of this game. Four drives, four touchdowns. Slow down. Reader, again, eyes in the backfield, worried about Aaron Jones. Look at that. I mean, until they correct this and start to sink a bit or change the coverage up, just keep throwing it to 18, about that 15 to 18-yard mark over the middle because the linebackers right now are not getting depth, and it's a good job by Sam Darnold throwing in rhythm. Got an issue for the Rams in that secondary. They used 12 defensive backs this year. Darnold buys time, rolls. He'll run it and slides to a stop inside the 25-yard line. So a 3.48 and ticking down to the end of the first quarter. The Vikings on the move again. New York Jets fans got to be sitting here watching Sam Darnold this year Just like, if I need another thing to drive me crazy, I've got to watch Sam Darnold in purple. Going to be at the Pro Bowl this year. Carolina fans, like, what in the heck is going on with Sam Darnold? What's going on with Sam Darnold is Kevin O'Connell and Wes Phillips have done a great job of working with him. Quick down here, look at Jones banging his way to the 22-yard line. Went in the lake, so it's interesting with Aaron Jones. in his eighth year in the league. They're going to go fast again. He's done so much damage to the Vikings through the years as a Packer. Now he's on the other side. Third and one, and Darnold gets it himself. Rams say he didn't get it, but the officials will make that judgment. And they signal a first down. Yeah, it is crazy to see Aaron Jones, after all those Lambeau Leafs, now wearing purple and gold, right? I mean, and you talk about a difference maker in that backfield because you get more caught up in Justin Jefferson and doubling him, and you've got Jordan Addison, and you've got Jalen Naylor, three really good receivers, and eventually Hawkinson back. And now instead of kind of a physical back like last year with Alexander Madison, now you've got an electrifying back in Aaron Jones. From the 20-yard line, short drop, pass to the outside. Again, that's Jefferson making his fifth catch. Philby Durant covering on the play. Darnold is 7 for 7. And Jefferson has scored 5 for 68 already. You know, and sometimes you look at what I was going to say about Darnold. Jets fans, Carolina fans are thinking, what's happened? What's happened is he's got great players around him. He's got a coach that's built his confidence up. This guy's always had the physical ability. I mean, he's the third pick overall. That was never a question. And it was a matter of him fitting in with the right system and the right players around him. And he's found a home here this year with Minnesota. Second and five. Out of the pistol. Jones again. So Jones makes that move. Not too many guys go from Green Bay to Minnesota. Of course, Brett Favre did it, but he made a one-stop flight in New York. Yeah, cool. That's right. Connected. How about Jones? So, you know, he's another guy that comes over and he knows, he understands before he signs to come over to Minnesota. He understands that, hey, Jefferson and these receivers, they're going to get a lot of attention. And that's not a bad thing for me in this running game. And the more they pay attention to 18, the better it's going to open up running lanes for me. So it all complements one another. First and goal. Ball spotted right at the 10. Garnold. Good protection again. That's caught. And that is Shurfield. Trent Shurfield for the touchdown. What a start for the Vikings. But they're used to that the way they've started almost every first quarter of this season. This is almost like watching a 7-on-7 drill here with the Vikings. These first couple drives in the lab. We didn't even bring up Shurfield. 11 right here who just works across underneath. Look at the linebacker's eyes in the backfield. They pick him up, but they don't pick him up until late. Easy throw in rhythm once again for Sam Darnold. That could not have gone any better, these two drives. 8 of 8, 97 yards, and two touchdowns. Joe Riker, his perfect season continues. He makes the extra point. Final minute, first quarter on Thursday Night Football. Quite a start. Minnesota 14, LA 7. Yeah. Guy who was on McVay's coaching tree. and the Rams went all in that year. All in, got Von Miller, traded for Stafford, and it paid off, and there's the banner. Reichard's kick is taken three yards into the end zone, and they'll bring it to the 30. So, of course, the rumor mill has been being thrown out there. Now, Kopp, it's conceivable that Cooper could wind up getting traded because there's a premium on getting wide receivers for the teams that need them. and we know that from what's taken place in the past. You have been the Rams' most productive player on offense. Now you face the Vikings with the second-ranked run defense in the league. What will it take to have success against them? Dominance, confidence, belief. We know who we are, come out and play the game that we know. It's not rocket science today. It ain't nothing we don't already know. This is football. We've been playing it since we was young. We've got to go out there and dominate. Well, and you'll get some help tonight with the return of wide receivers Cooper Cup and Puka Nakua, how can their presence change your attack? I just think, you know, they do what they do so well. You know, they get open, they catch the ball, and they make stuff happen after the play. So I think they bring a lot of threats to this defense. You know, threats that, you know, we haven't had all season. So now that we got them, I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm ready to go. Thanks, Kyron. Thank you. Yeah, all Rams fans are very excited. There is Cooper Cup. He was expected to play tonight, but not necessarily Puka Nakua, who they thought was still a week or two, maybe even longer away, but indeed here he is. So the two guys who were together on opening night for only 24 snaps, both in action tonight. Rams won the toss, have deferred. Ethan Evans, who's had 29 kickoffs this season, and 28 have resulted in touchbacks. Add one. So the Vikings will start so much for the dynamic kickoff with this guy. No doubt. The Vikings will start at the 30. A very familiar figure in this town, Sam Darnold, of course, went to USC. He was the number three pick overall. Baker Mayfield went first in 2018 with the Jets. Spotty there through the years sent him to Carolina. Last year he backed up Brock Purdy in San Francisco. J.J. McCarthy got drafted by the Vikings. He got hurt. He's gone for the season. So Darnold ascends to the top spot. he's got Aaron Jones the former Packer and CJ Hamm in the backfield and they start with Jones having a good year up to the 35 yard line so the two coaches very familiar of course with each other Kevin O'Connell was here and was the offensive coordinator when the Rams won the Super Bowl in the stadium against Cincinnati and of course Sean McVay at 38 years old incredibly in his eighth season as the head coach of the Rams. And what a coaching tree he has developed. On second down and five, a short drop and the pass is caught reaching out for Justin Jefferson who makes a lot of great catches. He's tackled there by Darius Williams and the Vikings with the game's first first down. Last week in the game against Detroit Justin Jefferson and Darnold off a little bit of a slow start in that first half, only three receptions. Going all the way back to his days with Joe Burrow at LSU and Jamar Chase. One thing about Jefferson, like a lot of the great ones, he loves to get his hands on the ball early, get into that rhythm. Good shot by Sam Darnold there, recognizing that opportunity to make him that throw. Now they go with two tight ends in this set. Keep it on the ground. Nice move by Jones to slip a tackle. Get to the outside and taken down by Durant. He broke away from Jared Burris. The Rams number one draft choice put a move on him and it's second down and short. Yeah, the rookie first got inside and that's who he bounced around and then a heck of a block there by Jordan Addison, which allowed him to spring to the outside for nine yards. Addison, their number two receiver. Give it to Jones again. He'll take the ball into Rams territory to the 42-yard line and another first down from Minnesota. Yeah, Darnold does a good job of managing this offense with Kevin O'Connell's and his offensive staff. You know, it's been a big story this year, these first six or seven weeks. The job that not just Sam Darnold is doing, because you look at the weapons around him, but it's just the decision-making and the position that Kevin O'Connell has put him in. I think a lot of that tempo allows him to communicate with him and give him some last-minute adjustments also within the headset. From the 42, play action. Darnold looking downfield, fires over the middle, and the traffic completes it. Jefferson to the 25-yard line. The Vikings are very strong out of the game. Meanwhile, Cam Curl, the Rams' safety, is down. So an injury timeout here. Jefferson, another spectacular season underway for him. Yeah, already they're getting him the football. Nice intermediate route here. This is an area that he's really worked to become that next level. We know about his big playability, but I found it interesting talking to Wes Phillips, the offensive coordinator. He said, you know, with the ability to push the ball down more downfield with Darnold, what we've really challenged Justin Jefferson is being more clean, more precise with his underneath routes, his intermediate routes, and that was a great example of that right there. They work on curl, and we'll take a break. Tough in motion. Stafford fires, and that's incomplete. lead. Cupp is looking for a flag. Won't get one. Stephon Gilmore. Yeoman worked through his 13-year career. Now a Viking covering. And Cupp's going to go in motion from the right to the left. Stafford actually works right. Look at his head. Then comes back. Great job of protecting there by that offensive line. They've done that again like the Vikings offensive line. Much of the of this opening drive and it looked like he may have grabbed a hold there onto the hip. That's what the crowd is reacting to. Absolutely. They saw the replay. Was it catchable to begin with? Third down and goal. In the pocket. Touchdown! Tyron Williams! His second receiving touchdown of the season. What a call here. I just happened to be watching Kyron Williams there live. And Ivan Pace, watch Ivan Pace think that the route is going out here. Watch how he gets himself out of position. He starts to run out, put your foot in the ground, you get back into the middle. Easy one-on-one matchup, but a great way to attack the interior of that Vikings defense with a back against a linebacker for that touchdown to potentially tie this one up. Cardi, a rookie from Stanford, Joshua Cardi. He's had a spotty beginning of his career, but this one is good. So each team with a stellar opening drive on this Thursday night in Southern California. 7-7. They not like us. They not like us. They not like us. Kaylee and Big Witt. Right, Witt. Got the whole thing going on here. Carissa. T-man or? T-man. Producer. Meanwhile, another touch. Excellent. He's only allowed one run back this year, has the Rams kicker. I wanted to find out who that was. Let's take a look at our next-gen stats. powered by AWS. There he is, Justin Jefferson. Very involved in that opening drive. Look at the 263 receiving yards, four touchdowns against man coverage. In that opening drive, the Rams just trying to keep him in front of them. The Vikings did a great job of hitting those interior routes to Jefferson on that opening drive. They went eight plays, 70 yards on that touchdown drive. Didn't have one third down on the opening drive. Darnold starts four for four. And it's time they wrap up Jones at the line of scrimmage. We go to the field. We go to Kaylee. Well, guys, as soon as Kevin O'Connell walked into the Vikings facility, just days removed from winning the Super Bowl with the Rams, Justin Jefferson told me he asked him, how did Cooper Cupp get that open? How was he able to get the Triple Crown? Because Jefferson believed his new head coach could lead him to that level. The main thing O'Connell told him was to learn every receiver position so he could operate from anywhere within the offense. Yeah, and he does. And he makes as many spectacular catches as anybody. Right on cue. He's in the back field. Yep. Flare him out. Looking that way. A pass is thrown to the outside. And that time it's Addison making the grab. Addison played his college ball at USC. Number one pick last year. So, Al, right on Kaylee's report, you move him back here. And you almost use him as a decoy to get Carnell Lake out here in the flat. He's, look at that. Got two defenders. You go over top to another really gifted receiver in Jordan Addison, who's fired up to be back here, played college balls last year at USC. But there's an example, and that's an area that the unselfish side of Jefferson understands he's going to get bracketed or double teamed. It's going to open up opportunities for the other guys. And Addison that time with a good catch there on the sideline. Jones. You know, it's never bad to have, you know, a number two receiver. We've got an alpha and a beta, and if the beta's any good, it takes a lot of pressure off the alpha. Yeah, that's exactly right. And when she talks about moving Jefferson around, you know who else has to learn other positions? That guy. Jordan Addison has to learn that. Jalen Naylor has to learn that. When T.J. Hawkinson comes back, even Aaron Jones, who, by the way, we'll talk more about him coming over from Green Bay and the addition of what he's made. I mean, you've got real weapons on this Vikings offense and a veteran offensive line in four of those five spots. Hawkinson is ready to come back maybe in their next game. Darnold fires over the middle. Caught again to the 31. And Jefferson having a great first quarter. Four grabs for him already. Darnold is perfect five for five. Omar Spates just lost here in coverage in for Troy. And all when Les Snead decided to pull the trigger, he and Sean, just because of what he can bring to the table. one, let's face it. Kyron Williams already 116 carries coming into the night. That is a lot of carries. So they're going to have to as the season goes along, you can see him right there getting taped up. You're going to have to get Blake Corham more and more carries and see what he can do as a rookie. He played with J.J. McCarthy. The Vikings' number one pick at Michigan. Meanwhile, that pass is caught and to the 14-yard line But Nakua, what a night. I mean, he's just picking up where he left off last season. No doubt about it. And watch this. We're just talking about the rookie. Well, they're going to challenge him right away. You've got to pick that up. And he gets just enough of Ivan Pace to give Matthew Stafford enough room to be able to get that ball out. And there's the beautiful hands of Nakua to pull that one in for the first down. Great look at that pass protection. Big emphasis this week for Williams and Corum against these linebackers, Blitzen. Williams is back in. Taped up. Meanwhile, in the end of the round, here comes Nakua again to the six-yard line. Puka Nakua, fifth-round draft choice out of BYU, came in and just exploded on the scene last year with the Rams. Tremendous rookie season. Yeah, and again, just to remind people that this guy is a big, big receiver. He's not your typical receiver you might see. Both he and Cooper Cupp, they're not that guy in the slot that's got wiggle. They're big guys, 6'2", 212 pounds, but he's got acceleration. You see that after he took that ball. Second and three. Eight play of the drive. Williams is taken down. You pick a guy named Puka. If you don't know who he is, he's got to be like 5'7". He's got a scat back. I'm with you. He's a stud. And again, another guy like Kyron Williams. You've got a guy like Matthew Stafford, 16th year, 36 years old. You bring in guys around him. It's nice to see how they've been able to add pieces that bring that energy. Now we've got a big third down here for Brian Flores in the Vikings defense. Kyron Williams now back in that backfield next to Stafford. Toby Parkinson the tight end. Now they got trips to the right. You got a flag here. Looks like Jackson moved. Left tackle. Full start. Offense number 77. If it wasn't going to be a false start by Jackson, It's hard to stay in there down there on third and short for these linemen. It was going to be a delay of game. It was under one second. So even if he doesn't move, you can see Stafford trying to hurry up. You've got a rookie center. Let's go fire that ball back here. So a little miscommunication pushes them back here now on third and seven. Bo Limmer is the rookie center. They've already used two timeouts because of that play clock already in the first half. So third down and seven. trips to the right. Stafford looks that way, and that's incomplete. Cup is covered, but you've got another flag. So they've got a break on an earlier flag. Gilmore is there with Cup. O'Connell hates the call. I think Gilmore got out of position and had to play catch-up. He got outflanked from that bunch look. They went into motion with Demarcus Robinson. They went to a three-receiver look. So Gilmore's got to try to work through some traffic, and now it's a foot race. The ball being underthrown makes Gilmore actually run into Cooper Cup. So good confusion with that pre-snap motion there. Slowed Gilmore, a little hesitant, and that's what allowed Cooper Cup to get outside of him. First and goal. Rams out of a tight formation. and taken down in the backfield. That was Pace coming through. Ivan Pace, second year out of Cincinnati. Knocks down Williams. It'll be second down and goal. This is what he's known for in his second year out of Cincinnati. Just downhill guy. Defensive line does a good job of protecting these linebackers. You see Metellus there as Limmer, the center, tried to get up to him. Both those backers are protected with Brian Flores' scheme because of the amount of big bodies they have up front. And then Parkinson finally found somebody to get open, and that's a first down. Well, let's give this offense a line credit. Rookie at center, rookie at left guard. And Matthew Stafford kind of, he's one of the first guys. Everybody talks about the arm angles. Brett Favre, of course, Aaron Rodgers. Look at him look right. Look at the protection left. And then he's like, I see it. Sneak that in like a shortstop flipping it going back to your, talking about his baseball days. Just flips it right there. Thought he might give up on it. With all that time, eventually he's going to find someone open. Two pumps. Down his man. Up in motion. Off the fake. And Williams drops it. Wouldn't have gotten very much anyway in all likelihood. It would be second down and ten. No, it's because one of the smartest guys in the game, Harrison Phillips, the nose guard, was out there. Seventh-year pro out of Stanford. it's almost better off he dropped it but that ball was definitely thrown forward by Stafford you know you asked earlier about Justin Jefferson and where is he where's Cooper Cupp they need to get the ball to 10 here scored 3 tonight only 15 yards but one of those was a touchdown and that is caught at the 41 yard line they go to Tutu Atwell it's the first time they've targeted him tonight and Tutu Atwell pulls that baby in for 18 you saw the man in motion Tyler Johnson he actually right there he goes into the flat and pulls that flat defender with him Shaq Griffin and a very simple high low read for as accurate a quarterback as you'll see in Stafford so well designed. Again, protection is there. Stafford's going to make that throw every time. With the two big guns missing until tonight, most of the season, Atwell was their leading receiver coming in tonight with 21 catches. Off play action. Going deep down the sideline. They go to Atwell again and that's incomplete because it's broken up at the very end by Murphy. got out in front but Murphy is able to make up the ground and knock it down incomplete second and ten yep you move him the way McVay usually does but it creates the matchup for an undersized Atwell to be able to get around Murphy Murphy I think thinks he has help that ball's actually thrown he saw him a little bit late and it gave Murphy enough time to be able to catch up and get that right hand if he threw that ball earlier if he would have seen it earlier He put it out in front. That's a touchdown. He knows it, too. Two big plays now for Murphy. The interception and that one. Second to ten, that play clock was down to zero. We've got a false start here. Everyone moved again. Snap didn't get up. False start. Offense. Number 79. Five-yard penalty. Second down. On Havenstein, his second penalty. Well, a missed opportunity. Let's see. Now you get a penalty. She got a second down and 15. You're right about Kup. Kup expected to play. Nakua not expected to play, but it's been Nakua's night, 87 yards. Kup limited to 15. Send him out to the sideline on the left. Pass over the middle. Wide open. There's Nakua. He takes it to the 26-yard line first down. Cam Bynum makes that tackle. Seven catches, 106 yards from Nakua. Watch him look left and then come back knowing exactly where he wants to go with his football. His eyes right now are over here to just open up the middle of this field. Comes back, steps into it, and throws an absolute laser in there to Nakua to come up with that first down. Game of one or two by Williams. Tackled by Redmond, second down. All the talk yesterday, today, about the potential. Could a Matthew Stafford ever get moved? And again, a lot of times it comes up with the salary and the cap hit and what it might be. I know you look at me, he's 36 years old. He's probably in as good a shape he's been in his whole life. He still makes throws like that. I don even know how that even a conversation unless it just all about the dollars Yeah 12 years in Detroit Came here Led him to a little Too deep Again, he goes to his way. He got Harrison Smith, who's had a stellar career in his 13th year. Number one pick years ago out of Notre Dame, third and six. I personally, I love what McVay does here. He gets the ball thrown downfield. through that 60 yards downfield. So Harrison Smith and Bynum, those safeties, who haven't had to really worry about that ball going over their heads at all tonight. We just talked about it. You know it's coming. If nothing else, that reminds them about Stafford and the ability to throw it downfield. That can open up opportunities underneath. Cup moving. Stafford throwing. And that's going to be picked off along the sideline. Murphy. With the interception. An overthrown ball and Murphy is able to corral it and stay in bounds with it. Three minutes into the third. Minnesota with the ball. And the game locked at 14. It's 12 interceptions now for the Vikings. Tops in the league. Second for Murphy this year. and Darnold and company go to work in the 28-yard line and start with a run by Jones. Again, minus their big left tackle, we go to Kaylee. Guys, Vikings left tackle Christian Derisal will not return to this game and he hasn't even returned to the Vikings' sideline. We saw him take that shot to the outside of his left knee and trainers were focusing on the stability of that knee when they evaluated him on the field. You saw him putting very little weight on that left leg as he limped off the field with a system. So he is out. You've got David Quisenberry, who's been around. Veteran tackle, six-year in the league. He takes his spot. Look out from behind. Pressure is put on, but the pass has gotten away to Jones. It gets a great clock and gets stripped up at the 43-yard line by Lake. You've got that 12 personnel in with two tight ends. The play action, what you want to watch are the linebackers. Watch how they get out. They're worried about their potential shots downfield. That's what the Vikings like to do, play action, take shots. But what they complement with that and make you have to respect is not just the running game, but the spring game as well. Again, Jones. Tackle never a very short game by Bobby Brown. Second and eight. No one's ever going to be Aaron Donald. We all know that. But Kobe Turner, who was the nose guard last year and had a great rookie year out of Wake Forest, 91, he's now moved out to that tackle spot where Aaron Donald used to be. And I tell you, he's got some twitch. He's a bit undersized but has great quickness and how about having a chance to learn from Aaron Donald. So that time he made a great play and relaying that lineman to get in the backfield. These days, 6'2", 297 is undersized. Pass caught here. Just shy of the first down. Trying to fight for it. Staying inbounds. Let's see if he got it or not. That's Jordan Addison. How about that effort? First down, yeah. Darius Williams was there. Addison again back. Played college at Pitt early and then ended up transferring to USC. Look at that effort. Look at that. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Got it. This Vikings team is an effort team. Both sides of the football. Can't get a better view than that. That was beautiful. Yeah. From the 47. To me, well, Jefferson, who is blazing hot in that first half, they've been doing a good job taking him away. He's already caught six for 74, but he's been quiet for the last quarter plus. Yeah, you're right. The way this game started, in the short week, they were determined to get him going early. And just as you say that, you know it's a matter of time. Just like last week against the Lions, they made a concerted effort to get him more involved than they did and had a lot to do with their comeback. He had 68 yards on the first two drives and only six yards since, second and eighth. Darlin avoids the sack fires, you knew that was coming the minute you talk about a guy who they take away, he makes the catch and a first down to the 31 yard line you could have predicted that Blake Brandl, the left guard makes a critical block here watch this, because I thought the pressure might be in Southern California there is Cam Curl, who had a fumble return for a touchdown four days ago against Vegas he comes out, Cam Kinchins A rookie out of Miami will take his spot at one safety spot. And the driver zooms at the 25-yard line on the first down for Minnesota. Again, it's Jones. Picks up about four. Christian Rosebool makes that stop. Second down at six. Chris Shula, who took over for Raheem Morris as the defensive coordinator, is trying to figure out life without Aaron Donald, like anybody would. He's the first time defensive coordinator in the past. They used to play shell defense, put the safeties back, and let number 99 wreak havoc. And now without him up there, you've got Kobe Turner and some others, but they're really trying to have to be more creative with that front, with twists, with stunts, with glitzing. They're still trying to find that identity. Donald on a second and seven, that shoulder shake. Fires over the middle. Caught. Jefferson again. He's made three grabs on this drive. Williams makes the tackle, and just like that, his first and goal for the Vikings. And now with Troy Reeder out, you've got Hoyt now playing that middle linebacker spot. He's an edge guy, but you can feel and almost sense these middle linebackers, with their eyes into the backfield, getting caught up on the underneath routes here on his first drive. And the Vikings done a great job of attacking the interior behind those linebackers and finding Jefferson with a big throwing lane there by Darnold, able to make that throw. Great protection, all drive here by the Vikings up front. How good are the Vikings in the first quarter? Did that score the opposition 58-3 over six games? Darnold, again, that shake. Looks the other way, wide open, touchdown. Tight end Josh Oliver. So Sam Darnold comes back to Los Angeles. This is from San Clemente in Orange County. Four for four on that drive for 49 yards. And just like that, 6-0 going on 7. Yeah, the motion, I think, impacts the coverage. Watch the safety try to communicate. Make sure he gets on the same page. And now you're going to come back the other way. And watch the safety trying to locate. Oh, whoa, whoa. I've got to get over there. So I think just a little thing with this Kevin O'Connell offense, much like Sean McVay, what they do before the snap really can impact the play call and the ability to produce touchdowns like that. Well, Riker, the rookie, has had a perfect season. That continues. And less than five minutes into the game, 7-0. Minnesota back in 30 seconds. So with that touchdown, 65 points in the first quarter. They've only allowed three. This is like in horse racing. And in their first five games, they're the horse, gets out of the gate and goes wire to wire. Last week, got out quickly, but overtaken down the back stretch by Detroit. Then they overtook the Lions and then got beaten at the wire by a nose. Is Breeders' Cup coming up? It is. Yeah. I like those analogies. I like those comparisons. And Santa Anita, too. Yeah. Kickoff fielded in the end zone, and the Rams now with Stafford and company will take over at the 30-yard line. So for Matthew, it's been a rough year in the sense that he's minus his two best receivers for most of the year. They're back tonight, and that offensive line has been a mix. And Matt Shubble, three of their offensive line starters on opening night in Detroit are on injured reserve. Yeah, and you've got a center in Bo Lemmer, who's a rookie out of Arkansas, left guard. Another rookie out of USC, a free agent. and you're going up against Brian Flores in an attacking, aggressive, complex Minnesota defense. Meanwhile, you've got Kup and Nakua didn't waste any time to get them both into the game, and it is dropped there by Nakua. So Puka, the question is how much will he play tonight? Was he going to play? He's active. He's right there. The pass is there. He couldn't hold on. Yeah, really good answer with that aggressive defense. And it just goes to show you, as good as Puka is, he has it. You look at his eyes. He's already starting to look up at Metellus, and he didn't quite have the ball secured. He just loses it. He tried to back him here. Second down and ten. There they go, walking guys up. Got six of them up. Lined up five wide. Cup in motion. Pass to the other side. Nakua makes this catch. And Nakua breaking tackles out to the 44-yard line. Alaric Jackson, a left tackle, spring in with a nice block first down L.A. Well, Cooper Cupp actually attracts some attention when he motions away, clears out the two linebackers in the middle. That's what freed him up. He gets Cooper Cupp back. He's got 13 of 18 is Matthew for 105. And here we go in the third quarter. Yeah, it's great to see both these quarterbacks in rhythm with the play callers. KO with Sam Darnold and Sean McVay, what he can do as good as anybody in this league. and now that he's got his weapons back for Matthew Stafford, really saw the rhythm of both these offenses, what they're capable of doing. I'm sure they're going to make some adjustments after the way that first half ended up and get back to work, put some points on the board. Rams get the second half kickoff. And we'll start at the 30. And moments ago, Kaylee on the field with Sean McVay. Sean, describe the impact Cooper Cup and Puka Nakua have been able to have coming back. They've been huge. I really like what we've been able to do. Matthew's been outstanding. We had a couple drives where we just kind of stalled because of penalties. They're a great defense, but second half, here we go. The Vikings scored two touchdowns, and then you held them to 2-3 and outs. What adjustments did you make? We were just able to get some pressure. We were able to eliminate them being efficient on early downs. We've got to keep going defensively, and then we've got to be able to get a little bit more momentum to be able to finish these drives offensively. Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Taylor. All right, now they start from the 30-yard line. And that pass, short game. You know, let's talk about the importance of this game for both teams. For Minnesota, they're 5-1. They're in good shape, but they're in the toughest division, the NFC North, which is 17-4 against other divisions. For the Rams, the difference between 3-4 and 2-5 at this particular point is huge. Yeah, especially with all the noise that's been circulating about the possibility of, you know, if they were to lose this game, the possibility of guys potentially moving. You win this game. That's two wins in five days. You get a little bit of a kind of that mini-buy, and you've got some momentum. So, yeah, you're right. Both teams need a win. Going deep on second and six, and McCoolish somehow is able to not catch it, even though it looked like for the moment he was able to work his way around Gilmore and probably what would have been an unbelievable catch. Amazing. Late flag, by the way. What else is new? What an effort to try to come back to that, but it would have been brought back anyway. You have a holding. Second down. I thought he was going to do it again. He's fun to watch. Never know what he's capable of doing. Vikings dialing up pressure, and even though they didn't get home, they did force that offensive line. Again, you've got a rookie at center. You've got a rookie at left guard. And you've got a Vikings defense that can dial up as much pressure as anybody in this league. Dial on Dedic, second down and 16. After the penalty from the 24-yard line. Kyron Williams. Hit hard as he crosses the 30-yard line by Harrison Phillips. Third down and nine. Williams tonight is carried a dozen times for 80 yards. also caught a touchdown pass. This is where the Vikings love to get Pat Jones in there with Grenard and Van Ginkle and try to dial it up, see if they can create some one-on-one opportunities. And get to Stafford, get that ball out of his hands quickly. They're going to show pressure like they always do on third down. Harrison Smith up there as well, 22 off to the right. Extra man comes Stafford throws Nakua along the sideline Hauls it in Again Gilmore Covering on the flip I'll tell you what For a guy who you know Has been hurt Wasn't supposed to play Barely practiced What a night Yeah and let's give Stafford A lot of credit For the timing of that ball He anticipates That's a tough thing to do on third down. Look at that left foot get down. Great footwork there. Possesses the football. That's a great catch, but Stafford throwing the ball early gave him that chance to get those feet down. Six catches, 87 yards for Nakua tonight. From the midfield stripe, a five-yard gain here for Kyron Williams. Tackle by him. Tell us if he's second down. At the end of the day, when you're having a good night offensively, it's obviously players like Nakua and Cooper Cup coming back, but it's those conversions on third down. They had a hard time last week converting on third down. They were 2 of 10, and by being able to come up with that first down conversion, now you get back, you cross midfield, start to run the football. They tried that double move, and we keep calling for it. He's not throwing the ball downfield much, but you know it's coming. Second and six. Off the fake. Going deep. Have some space. Love the call. They walk six up here the first time. And the answer and the response, you move Cooper Cup, watch the middle linebackers get out of there with them, and now you throw back the other way. Well designed there early in this game by Sean McVay. Rams use a lot of motion. Here's Moore. Nakua's the man in motion. Here's Williams. Big hole. Tyron Williams having a great year. Picks up 13 and a first down. Harrison Smith making the stop for the Vikings. You know, Kyron Williams averaging 3.8 yards a carry, and a lot of attention's been on Stafford. You know, what's wrong with this offense? Well, obviously the injuries. But when you get these two receivers back, we talked about it in the open, these are big guys, 6'2", 210. They block well, especially in those condensed formations. So the beneficiary is not just Stafford tonight. It's that run game and Kyron Williams as well. Williams touchdowns in nine consecutive games, Three last year, six this year. Stafford, to the right and throws it to the left. Hits Tyler Johnson, fourth-year man out of Minnesota. He'd be the number three or four wide receiver right now. And then a set of a second down to four for a gain of six. As you look at Brian Flores, the Vikings defensive coordinator. He is, I told him this week, I said, you know what I love about your defense. You look at all these guys on this defense. They brought in about four or five new faces. Some of them didn't get drafted. Some of them got let go by the previous franchise they were with. They all have chips on their shoulder. Brian Flores has a bit of a chip on his shoulder as a defensive coordinator. It's kind of a perfect fit together, perfect marriage of intensity and how they play with, as I say, that collective chip as a defense. Time out. Los Angeles. Taken here by the Rams with eight and a half to go in the quarter. Your 30-second timeout. And, yeah, the Vikings felt good enough about the guys they brought in, including like Jonathan Grenard, to let Daniel Hunter out the door. Yeah, yeah. And Grenard, he's fourth in the NFL in pressures. He's done a great job. How about Andrew Van Ginkle coming over from Miami? He's been asked to do a lot of different things in his defense. And just for Vikings fans, I know they know what this means. Blake Cashman, who another new guy came over from Houston, he's the communicator in the middle, that middle linebacker. And he's not dressed tonight. So they're having to come up with some answers without him. And I think that's where you'll see Van Ginkle moving around even more. But look at these numbers. Interceptions, the tops in the league. You can see the touchdowns that they've allowed. Sacks, 24-3. They're top five in a lot of different categories. Second against the run. So it's been a great start to this year. Talk about Van Ginkle. He already has two pick sixes this season. Motion by Nakua. Play fake. Nakua takes the pass. and Nakua inside the 30, inside the 20 to 16-yard line. Dotson and Dedich, the guards got out there to provide the convoy. Hunter Long, the tight end stays in. They basically max protect here. You got the back back here. You got a tight end right here. So you got seven to be able to protect against that aggressive downhill defense. Good job of picking up Ivan Pace. Now you're getting it out in a hurry. You got blockers downfield. You got a convoy there. Good job getting behind that and picking up positive yards. And I love how quick that ball is getting out of the hands of Matthew Stafford. Williams. Trying to find a spot in Williams with a flag thrown on the first of the game. In fact, two flags as well. Yeah, pretty obvious what went on there. He's telling them he got the face mask, man, before he even went down. And two officials say, oh, yeah. We got you, man. We got you. We got it. Trey Blake is tonight's referee. Personal foul. Face match. Defense number zero. Could only have half a distance to the ball. Automatic first down. Ivan Pace. Who had a fumble return for a touchdown Sunday against Detroit. So that moves the ball to the seven. Makes it a first down and goal. Rams ready to run their seventh play of this drive. So far, two runs and four passes. to the Rams trying to answer Minnesota's opening salvo. Williams to the five. Base making the tackle there. Second down and goal. This opening drive by the Rams doing a really good job. Mentioned the ball getting out of his hands. Different looks, formations, motions. and by getting the ball out in a hurry, a lot of these screens, they're getting offensive linemen in space against smaller defensive backs, and that's always a good thing. When you can get the ball out, you've got that second and third level. Linemen are running downhill at those defensive backs. They've gotten a couple big plays off of that. Right now, Kyron Williams is the back on second and ten. He gets it. Looks for room. Threads his weight. Eight of eight, and another flag. So a relatively flag-free first quarter and a ton here in the second. Holden. Offense. Number 50. Ten-yard. Second down. Well, that's Bo Limber again. So tough night for him. And minus Jackson and Avila, the two starting linemen. So, a rookie in its center and having a tough one tonight. Yeah, I was just going to say the backside does such a good job on his zone play. It allows him to cut it back. But right in the middle there is the hold against Pace with Limmer. Trying to block Pace. But, man, what a great shot. Look at that hole open up on that backside. Great vision. But it's all for naught with the holding call. Second and 20. trying to set up his screen but nothing happening here busting that play up is Van Ginkle Kyron Williams made the catch Van Ginkle free agent six year in the league out of Wisconsin came over from the Dolphins yeah I talked to him on the field before the game just kind of talking about Wisconsin's got a big game he's a big obviously was there and played and great player and they Penn State this week we were just talking a little bit about stuff and I said you ever played even in college did you play off ball backer you're always an edge guy to me and he said And, you know, I didn't really. This year I'm really enjoying the opportunity once in a while to get back there. He and Metellus both, 44, both of them move around. Third and 18. And Williams takes it out to the 22. But they're bringing the punt group for the first time tonight with a little less than five and a half to go in the half. So both offenses after touchdowns on their first two drives self-destruct a bit and caused him not to be able to get that ability to sustain drives on his third drive, and defenses finally get stops. Ethan Evans sends it down toward Brandon Powell. Powell catches it at the 36, and runs it back out to the 44-yard line with 4.46 to go. in the first half. Rams-Vikings, 14-0. We're turning 28. Three teams in three years. Last year, at San Francisco, backing up Purdy. Then he had a chance to. He was a free agent. Looked around. Thought that Minnesota was the right fit for him. So far, so good, obviously. From the 42. Good play fake. Now protection. Breaks down and tackled. That's versed with the sack. back at the 30-yard line. The initial protection was very good, and Burse giving the skull sign. What an impressive rookie year that Jared Burse is enjoying. You knew it was a matter of time. This is up against a tight end here, Josh Oliver. It's a matter of time until he starts coming up with sacks. He's 32 pressures, which is 15th in the NFL as a rookie. So you know eventually he's going to get home and be able to come up with plays like this. and it's more kind of a bull rush, more power. It's not twitch always around the end. He has that, but it's more about overpowering the man across from him. He did a good job there. Second and 20. And another flag here. Another pre-snap mistake. Full start. Offense, number 71. Bobby Artility, second down. Before we leave verse, I mean, how about having the awareness of going, hey, wait a second. I'm playing in a stadium where a lot of times the visitors, the visiting fans overwhelm the home fans. Not necessarily so tonight, but then giving the sign for the score. After the sack. He's letting them know, hey, this is our house. I don't need to see and hear that. Right. Second and 25. Look out again. The boys, the sack. Chased. and just fires that one away incomplete. That time Byron Young did the chasing, third and 25. This time they use Fisk, another rookie out of Florida State, to almost set a screen. He's right here. He's going to work to the inside, and then Young's going to work underneath him. That time the left guard, Brandel, isn't able to adjust over, so even though he doesn't come up with a sack, a great pressure that time. You look at zero on one side and eight on the other. Those two were really dangerous off the edge for this Rams defense when they dial it up. Instead, he was blocked into him. And a couple of seconds on the clock. Second and six. And that's knocked away in 10 different cup. Stephon Gilmore, who's done that a lot in his 13-year career, knocks it down third and six. Patience that time, just sitting back. He knows whether it's 17 or 10. This time it's Cooper Cup 10. A lot of underneath throws. It's most of what Stafford has thrown. Getting the ball out of his hands quicker. And Gilmore timeout went up. Almost baited him to throw it. Got a round cup to knock it away. Stafford. and that's knocked down and that time as Jonathan Garnard came over as a free agent from the Texans so fourth down and the Rams will putt there's Flores again this time he shows pressure once again giving you a different look just rushes three drops eight everybody's downfield even if he makes this catch and that ball gets over Garnard there's two defenders right there and he wouldn't even have gotten back to the line of scrimmage and Ethan Evans will try to drop it short of the goal line put some backspin on it they let it bounce and he did put in a backspin on it perfect down to the 5 yard line so the Vikings have it there 35 seconds another flag is down at the 44 yard line of the Vikings during the kick holding receiving team number 15 well backs them up even farther now they have all three timeouts but what are you going to do with 35 seconds yeah yeah by the way four opening drives of this game touchdowns now the last four got a little sloppy you know even with the timeouts at your own two yard line This is where you just get out of here, in my opinion. You would think. Make the adjustments, right? Then again, every time we say something like that, you know what happens. Yeah. Then again, any time 18's out there. Right. I'm thinking nothing like a 97-yarder to him. Nope. As it would figure, that's Jones up to the 5. And they should look the clock. Yeah, we got a guy down. Yeah, we're all the way down. That'll stop the clock with the injury. That's Christian Garrison. He's their best lineman. The left tackle. I think Jones, as he got to football, he may have cut back. A defender maybe rolled up on Garrison. Coming from our right. Right there. See that lower left leg. Yeah, that's Jalen McCullough. We talked about him with his three interceptions, the rookie free agent who got in there. And that's why Darasaw's going to need the attention. And he's still down in the end zone. Oh, man. 21 seconds to halftime. So Darasaw got up and needs to be assisted back to the locker room. The left tackle. Kevin talking about him the other day. What a great job he's done. And that offensive line, we talked about it before. All five starters, every game, they've started every game this season, and they missed only nine snaps collectively. But now David Quisenberry comes in. And it's a heck of a way to lose your left tackle with just trying to run the clock out. And a kneel down here will take us to halftime. So a spirited beginning to the half Slow down a little bit toward the latter stages But 14 all as we go to the break And coming up after the break It will be the State Farm Halftime Show With Carissa and the gang In this game Was a track beat Four touchdowns 21 first downs The last five drives, no touchdowns and only three first downs. Meanwhile Darnold in his first six seasons no games with two teepee passes in the first quarter This season he had three Vikings again coming out of the gate in a hurry tonight First six games for Stafford this year Only three touchdown passes tonight to him Of course he gets to him. He goes inside and then outside. And just by moving Fisk, Fisk gets his hand on Sam Darnold. But this is where Jefferson had most of his opportunities. Over the middle of that defense. Behind those linebackers who were getting lost a little bit in coverage. Darnold from the corner to Jefferson getting one-handed. He's juggling, and they are going to say he did catch it. Officials check with each other. I'm sure they'll take a peek at this one. Vikings are going to race up to the line before the Rams can get set, before they can challenge this. Let's see. Whoa, baby. Is it worth a challenge? Will McVay throw the flag? Too late. Taken down there. Jones gets taken down by Darius Williams. I think he ended up catching it at the end. How about the nonchalant left hand to get it started? A little hold there. Watch him. No problem. Oh, oh, oh. Now he's got it. Tremendous. Terry McCauley giving us the catch sign. He believes it's a catch. 27 yards. He's in triple digits right now at 115. By the way, let's not take those catches for granted. We're just so used to him doing that. That was spectacular. Every week. By the way, I'm going to give you an assist. Right when you said, where's our guy 18 been? Back-to-back catches. We woke him up. Second and goal. Inside handoff. Taking it to the four-yard line is Aaron Jones. Third down and goal. Seven minutes remaining in the third. He just does so many different things. You know, I used to, when I watched him play with Joe Burrow, I used to think, this guy looks like he played a lot of backyard football in his day as a kid. You know, his older brothers that played football, they played at LSU. And he just has such natural, savvy instincts. Beyond just, yeah, he's a good receiver, yeah, he's fast. He's just a baller. So Murphy on the bench, his interception. Setting up his drive. Darnold in the pocket fires and that's incomplete Jefferson got bracketed that time by Josh Wallace and Quentin Lake in his fourth down and goal and they'll send in the field goal team even though they move him from the left over to the right he's still going to find a way to double him still take him inside and outside even with that double move and another thing that started to creep in there with Carousel out and Quisenberry in And I think he felt the pressure that time from the left side with that backup tackling. Reichert hasn't missed a kick all season. Chip shot here. No problem from 23. So the Vikings have the lead again as they had it twice in the first half. He does it every week. 17-14. Jefferson made those two catches, including that one spectacular one, but couldn't pay it off in the end zone. Frustration on the sideline. But the Vikings have the lead. A little Reichert to kick off. And a yard deep in the end zone. Cornwall down up there. We go to Kaylee on the sideline. Kaylee. Guys, it's time now for tonight's journey presented by Hyundai. Matthew Stafford, the number one overall pick from the 2009 draft, is the only quarterback left standing 16 seasons later. Mark Sanchez made it the next longest, and he hasn't played in six years. Stafford's longevity has actually surpassed every player in that draft, with one exception, New York Jets punter Thomas Morstead, probably with a little bit less wear and tear. Yep, the one. Yeah, absolutely. So Stafford now from the 30s, 50 to 22 for 128. And stuffed up the middle is Williams. Well, he got off to a quick start. We talked all day in our meetings. Kuka Cubs back. Kuka Nakua is back. The biggest thing that I think we saw earlier in breaking routes and the ball getting out of his hand. It's tough for this attacking Vikings defense. be able to get to him until that last drive where they got a good push on the left side and they doubled and took Cooper Cup away. He tried to get it over the top to DeMarcus Robinson and just missed. Second and eight. Stafford looked toward the curve. Comes twice. Throws. Caught over the middle. Most of the time it would need something really good. And also, I think tonight's game is going to be a big factor in what happens. Yeah, like you said, I mean, if they're able to win this football game, why in the world would you want to make a move sitting there at 3-4 and getting healthy finally? Just like last year when they won seven of their last eight. Yeah, if they win tonight, they'd be 3-4, go to Seattle, as that pass is caught, and take it to the 46 on Nakula, who didn't, as of Monday, everybody going, No, he's not going to play. They're going to wait another week. They've got a mini bye coming up. All of a sudden, not only is he playing, he's been targeted four times, three catches, 50 yards. And Sean McVay and Wes Phillips, they're attacking that much like Minnesota. They're attacking the interior of that second level with the linebackers up tight. Six guys coming that time on pressure. Ball out of his hands. And the line is doing a great job so far by helping out Matthew Stafford against his pass rush. Protected well. Reaching back and incomplete is Cooper Covey. Trying to reach back for it. Passed an error. 10 seconds to go in the quarter. Second down. Yeah, never secured it. Never quite brought that in. So an easy incompletion. But again, another quick ball. Just that one just a little bit behind Covey. Remember, all those option routes that he has underneath, he can go to the left. He can set the guy up depending on the leverage. You can get inside of the right. And that time, I think they read it. I think they were on the same page. You just put that to rare miss for Stafford. He's almost like a pitching machine. You just assume it's going to be accurate every throw. He was a catcher in high school when he caught Curtin. Play shot. Meanwhile, timeout. Rams are going to take their 30-second timeout. Not yet. Everybody knows, I think, the story that follows baseball and football. Both Clayton Kershaw and Highland Park. Highland Park done in Dallas, right? Dallas, right. Speaking of the Dodgers. The Dodgers. What a story that's going to be in the next couple weeks. Game one tomorrow night. Dodgers-Yankees. Your family is up here. At some point, they're going to try to sneak and get behind this coverage. Kind of luring them up to eventually get that double move and hit a shot downfield. Second and ten. Goes the other way. Williams slips a tackle, slips another one, and makes a little something out of nothing as the time winds down and the first quarter is over. End of one. Entertaining first quarter. 14-7, Minnesota. Justin Jefferson with 68 yards off just five catches. How have you been able to get him going so early? Yeah, I think first and foremost, I love what we're doing at the line of scrimmage, getting the run game going and then Justin's finding some space right now because of that and also the fact we just have so much confidence in our guys. I think Sam's playing great. Great rhythm, tempo, ball's jumping out of his hands. So we're off to a good start but we've got to sustain. Sean McVay's got his offense coming too. How do you slow them down? Yeah, we know that Sean's going to call a great game. They'll have a great plan. So we've got to just play complimentary football. See if we can get off the field here on a critical third down, get the ball back and go try to score again. Thanks, Kevin. Well, indeed, they got off the field, but there's a flag. That was a third and seven. Holden, defense, number seven. Five-yard penalty, automatic first down. So they got off the field, but only momentarily, because the flag is on Byron Murphy, first down L.A. Now, that play went exactly the way Brian Flores would want. Get him down to third and seven, and then bring the pressure. disguise it and this is this ends up being the holding call right here on Murphy one of the corners well I really didn't see much of anything if it was on seven there was not a hole there DeMarcus Robinson he was ostensibly holding meanwhile great moves by Williams I'll tell you what this this kid doesn't get a lot of attention he needs to start getting a lot more attention Touchdowns now in five consecutive games. Beautiful run here, 18 yards. Yeah, he brings great energy. Great block right here. And then watch Puka get up to that next level. Seal the edge with Davis Allen. Now Puka's able to get up on Stephon Gilmore. And you're right, this guy's not looking to run out of bounds. He was the same way in college at Notre Dame. Tough, low center of gravity. And I really think the offensive line, talking to Witt, this offensive line, they kind of feed off of backs that run with that kind of passion. He comes out for the moment. Corham comes in. There's a rookie out of Michigan who had a tremendous college career, as you well know. Short gain here, second down. He's very similar as far as personality and makeup. It didn't surprise me. By Harrison Phillips, so easy tackle that time for Pace getting downhill. Vikings minus Blake Cashman tonight. He's hurt. Leads the team in tackles. Meanwhile, Stafford chased, escapes, fires, caught. Touchdown. Cooper Cupp. I mean, are you kidding me? 36 years old. 36 years old, and he's a great athlete. But what a job of the Rams answering Sam Darnold. Watch this spin move here by Grenard. He's fourth in the NFL in pressure. Spin move. Beautiful. Has a chance for the sack. The big fella, Harrison Phillips, but no. Stafford, I know he's going to feel good about that one Gets out of that And then the vision downfield to find his main guy 10 cut for the touchdown Drive with a coop chant Joshua Carty for the point after And with 10.05 to go in the first half We have a track beat Four drives, four touchdowns We love it We love LA, we gotta love it We love Minnesota too Kansas City day after Thanksgiving as the Raiders and the Chiefs have added on Black Friday even when those two teams will meet on Sunday in Las Vegas first week there two meetings this season got the two coaches, got the two quarterbacks got 28 points on the board and the Rams to kick off Ethan Evans does it again. Down we go to Kaylee. Guys, it's time for Jits for Kicks, presented by the all-new Nissan Kicks. There's Donald Palm, the rookie's nerves before the season started and reassured him, it's just football. He said, don't let it go to your head. Averse off to a very good start, number one pick. Meanwhile, Ty Chandler is now the running back, number 32, Aaron Jones, getting a rest at least at the moment. You've got Jefferson in motion, and you've got a flag. Everybody moving. The ball didn't come up from Bradbury, the center. That was a problem for Minnesota against Detroit. They got behind the sticks with some pre-snap penalties. I know it. Talking to KO this week, I know it was driving him crazy. They've executed so flawlessly here, these first two drives. By the way, how about Sam Darnold in the first quarter this season, now that the first quarter's behind us? It's incredible. 81% of his passes, 418, six touchdowns, no interceptions, a 143 QB rating. And 8 for 8 tonight, 97 yards. He will have Viking offensive line. They've stayed healthy. Same five starters every game this year. They've missed only nine snaps. Compositively, another flag thrown here. Yeah, I don't think the Vikings had the right formation. Only three guys in the backfield. Deja vu to last week. Area that they wanted to clean up on a short week. That's it. It will be declined for the second down. Well, they ran the play, so the Rams will take the play and make it second and 15 instead of first and 20. Meanwhile, Cam Curl, who got hurt earlier, he is now back at safety. And on second and 15, J.J. in motion, takes the pass, gets a block, moves forward up to the 31-yard line, tackled there by Jalen McCullough, a rookie out of Tennessee who had two interceptions last week and already three on the season. Gives them a shot here on third down. Interesting the Rams let that second penalty go because they got to play. Now we got it to third down. See if they can dial up some pressure. They've not been able to do that. Even when they've blitzed, Darnold has really been untouched back there. Very clean pocket. They have good pass rushers. Verse 8-0 young. See if they can get after him. third and nine look out from behind Donald feels it steps forward but the throw is low and incomplete and for the first time in the game we have a fourth down Michael Hoyt that time put the pressure on Fisk as well yeah yeah first is does a good job in the behind kind of behind the quarterback here but the push in the interior for Michael Hoyt I think affected him as much as anything right into the face three and a half till halftime third and 25. Rush three, drop eight, caught, 35-yard line. Jalen Naylor, the speedy one, makes his first catch of the night, and a fourth down. We're back to what Chris Shula told us this week about defending this offense, led by Kevin O'Connell and Sam Normal. He said, listen, we've got to get negative plays. Got to get them behind the sticks. And with that sack and then the penalty, second straight series, able to get them behind the sticks and get them off the field. Ryan Wright's second kick. Drifting and making the fair catch at the 11 is Xavier Smith. 250 to the half in Wienglewood on this Thursday night. Each team scoring on its first two drives, and now nothing but a slowdown game and punch. And we'll have a third and fourth downs, and the Rams will begin this drive from their own 11-yard line. Out of a tight formation. Williams. McVeigh is great. I mean, he's an offensive genius. It's so funny, though. They use probably more tight formations than any team in the league, but he can do so much out of them. Yeah, I think he's really the guy that brought that and made it the trend in the league, going back maybe seven or eight years ago. And so many people now have copied that. And you see it in college and, obviously, the NFL. And I think the reason is it helps you in the running game as much as anything. If you have receivers, it can help you set the edge. But then it creates so much space outside on the perimeter for those receivers to work on those second-level routes. Second and six. He looked to his way and instead throws to Parkinson is tied in. Cody, Colby Parkinson out of Stanford. And a timeout taken here after the first hour. Actually, it's the two-minute warning. The two-minute warning is upon us. 14 off. Our own Fab Five. Andrew Whitworth. There he is. How about ending your career here in the Super Bowl with a victory? Big ring. Yep. Little Mike, big ring. Massive. That man will be in the Hall of Fame someday. No question in my mind. From the 23-yard line, the Rams now on a first down. Williams busting one for 12 after the 35. Now the Rams, because they use those two timeouts, have only one in the final two minutes here. You know, I think one of the big stories this first half is just Stafford and the ability to throw. I think Witt would be very proud of what he's seeing from this offensive line, especially those two rookies out there. Stafford, out of the pocket, looks for Williams, underhands it to him, a little shovel toss, picks up a few, second down and four, gain a six. Nice little touch there. most important thing there, able to get out of bounds and again, showing that mobility Voided that rush it's like he's out of practice, just flipping that down the field now he knows where the blitz is coming with pace right here those two guys circled one of them comes, meanwhile fighting his way and that'll be enough for a first out before he is Gang stopped. To move Gruset Hill. There amongst them. Clock is running down. Again, that one timeout for the Rams remains. As much as this Minnesota defense bluffs, they show it, they back out. Sometimes they show it and they bring it. Good job of using that hard count to try to get them to tip their hand, get an indicator. Case coming from the outside. Pass is caught at the 50-yard line. That's Cup. Flag is thrown with 53 seconds. That would have been, if it stands, Cup's third catch tonight. Nakua's been the big guy. There's no foul for working the passer as the defender was blocked into the quarterback. They felt Jackson, 77, threw pace down. Watch 77. Watch him throw him down. Actually, both those defenders, they closed in on Stafford. Stafford wanted it right away. Watch the follow-through by 77's arms. That's probably why they... Barney throws this one to the corner. Reaching for it. But a flag is thrown in the end zone. Robinson comes down with it for the moment. Demarcus Robinson. And the Rams already celebrating. They go Robinson's way for 25 yards. and the flag will be against Minnesota. Defense number one. That's what he did with the client. He's over the place. Kester. Penalty on Zach Griffin. We talked so much about Nakua and Kup. Here's Demarcus Robinson who gets one-on-one. There's the hold that he's able to work through that hold. No safety support over the top. You see 44 Metellus coming over late, but you're on an island. And with this defense, if Brian Flores plays, you've got to be able to hold up. Good ball by Stafford, and the Rams are able to take the lead here in the third. Robinson's first catch of the night. Cardi boots it through. Two and a half left in the third. And the Rams have the lead for the first time tonight by four. What a call here by Sean McVay to motion Tyler Johnson over. And when he moves him, Steph Gilmore is actually going to run with him, which tells Matthew Stafford, I got man to man. I got one-on-one out here, and I'm going to win. Keep the safety in the middle. Put it out in front. Like I said, he's able to work through the hole. That's the third corner with Shaq Griffin in there. They knew exactly the matchup that they had. It's almost like, I told you this was going to happen. I told you we'd get that shot, that one-on-one matchup, and he hit it. And the celebration on the sideline. Meanwhile, got a touchback here. This town, everybody talking about the passing of Fernando Valenzuela. There he is on the left, 63 years old. And, of course, Fernando Mania overtook this town back in the early 80s. Pitched in the World Series Game 3 in 1981, Yankees-Dodgers. I did that game. He threw 147 pitches in that game. This is your grandfather's baseball. Wow, Iron Man. Think about that. There's the Dodgers in action against the Yankees tomorrow. Walked seven guys, gave up nine hits, and pitched a complete game. Dodgers came from behind to win it. That's amazing. To the 35-yard line. It meant so much to this town. All these years later, what do you think of when you think of Fernando? You've called probably so many of his games. I did, and, you know, just his delivery, and he looked at the sky, you know, the wind-up and the whole thing, and Vince Scully called all of his games to throw a sombrero in the air. I mean, he was very special, very humble, wound up as the broadcaster on Spanish-language radio with the Dodgers for many years, a wonderful, humble man. Before he turned this town upside down when he was pitching. No doubt. Second and five from the 35-yard line. Darnold moves up, throws, caught to the 45. Goes Johnny Munt, tight end. And that's the first down. I'd love to see Darnold again, who's been questioned throughout his career, could he be the guy? And we've all seen what he can be within this offense. But even there, he has the athletic ability to get out of there. And we've seen last week, especially using his legs, But instead of just back there taking off when he feels some pressure, he just subtly moves up, buys a little bit of time, climbs the pocket, checks down, first down. That's quarterbacking in this offense. That's a great job. Jones on the toss. Taking down as we go to the final minute. Hoyt makes the tackle. Under a minute to play. in the third. Yeah, Bobby Brown that time also involved, working down the line of scrimmage. Big man. Nose guard at 328 pounds. They're doing a good job of rotating, trying to stay fresh up front. Surprised Chris Shula told me the unsung hero of this defense is 97. Hoyt, because they can do so many different things with him. Chris Shula, defensive coordinator, grandson of Don, son of David that's caught across the 50 Jalen Naylor makes that grab and Darnold's going to take him to the line and try to get another playoff before the end of the quarter. It's third down and three and in the books he'll get credit for two points that would have been first and 10 at the 20 with a minute 36 left in the game meanwhile the Vikings have declared for an onside kick for what it's worth has to go 10 yards unless the Rams Touched first. And the Vikings then recovered. Rams are going to call a timeout. Timeout. Los Angeles, their first of the half. 32nd timeout. Well, again, the chances of winning the game would have still been minimal, but. Right. But. Right. It's a first down, and it gets you away from the shadow of your own goal line. I mean, it gets you all the way out to the 20. When you have Justin Jefferson and these receivers, who knows what happens. Human error. Yeah, and I get that. That's part of the game. So Sean McVay, whose team was 1-4, now in all likelihood going to 3-4. Have a mini-bye. Of course, the Thursday night game gives you 10 days. Yeah. Some momentum. You're healthy. You have a little rest. You go to Seattle. Meanwhile, the Vikings have Indianapolis next week. Then they go to Jacksonville. They go to Tennessee and Chicago. They have a three-game road trip. I've seen a tougher schedule, but, you know, it's the NFL. Yeah, exactly. What's going to happen, right? You know, the Rams matter time with Jonah Jackson, Steve Avila. Once they get their starters back. So, meanwhile, that is Kyron Williams. Who else? gets into the saddle and hops off the field, and the Rams will run the clock out. So the Rams will go to 3-4, SoFi Stadium. Beautiful. This is as good as it gets, right? Yeah, it's beautiful. His face says it all. Not only a victory, but to think about where they were before the bye, 1-4, a ton of injuries, a lot of questions. What's wrong with Stafford? What's wrong with this? What's wrong with that? They get Nakua back. They get Cup back. They win last week. And all of a sudden, you're sitting there at three and four in a division. It's going to be wide open. As I said at the outset, don't write them off. They'll get healthy. And who would have guessed that, you know, you knew Cup was coming back tonight. You didn't know Nakua was coming back. Whole different situation. There's the upcoming schedule at Seattle. Miami comes in here. They go to New England. Philadelphia comes in here, go to the Bayou, and then Buffalo comes in week 14 looking ahead. What a different feel when you put those two out there. I mean, not just Stafford in the passing game, but the running game with Tyron Williams. It's just the offense you expect from Sean McVay and Matthew Stafford. And again, wait until they get their starting center and left guard back. It's only going to get better. I think McVay loves when we come to town for a Thursday night game. I know a couple of years ago, they were in the doldrums. They were in a terrible year following their Super Bowl win. And Baker Mayfield came in. Who can forget that? 48 hours. No problem. He arrived in Los Angeles. Let him on that gigantic drive at the end of the game. It helped Baker turn his career around, too. Vikings are going to be just fine. They're going to use these two losses, recalibrate. They played well enough to win both of them. They just got to get it going. They will. They'll get T.J. Hawkinson back against Indy. So they'll be in good shape. Two good buds beating it midfield. Matthew Stafford, three TD passes in the first six games. He's a four tonight, 279 yards. Big night for him. Big night for Nakua, who had 106 receiving yards. and the Rams get a nice 10-day break and hit to Seattle Kyron Williams tonight 23 carries 97 yards no rushing touchdowns but kept the streak alive a touchdown now in 10 straight games with a reception in the end zone so the Rams win it by a score of 30 to 20 and don go anywhere Big as the Chiefs At least trying to draw them offside which he cannot Triple zero is on the clock, and off we go to the fourth, and a good one. On Thursday Night Football, Rams. Three. And Kaylee Hartung, the standings. You can see the Vikings five and one, Lions are also five and one. That division, the toughest in the NFL right now. Rams trying to get to three and four. would be a game back of the Seahawks, whom they play a week from Sunday. Seahawks this week hosting the Buffalo Bills up north. Third down and three as we start the fourth. Darnold steps up in the pocket. Throws, and it's along the sideline. It is caught by Aaron Jones. I mean, this is a red alert, red alert. You've got to match up with Hoyt. This guy's 280 pounds. There's no way, no way he can match up with Aaron Jones. And a big third down, he saw that matchup. His eyes lit up, knew exactly what he wanted to do. You're talking about Aaron Jones being, and that's a good job getting his feet down in the backside. This guy's got wide receiver skill set as far as running routes. And he got matched up against a big guy, Hoyt, who we just talked about being an unsung hero. But you can't ask him to do that and cover it. Didn't Green Bay for years, one of Aaron Rodgers' favorite players. from the 23-yard line. And you've got a flag before the snap. I think Tim O'Connor may have snuck down there and got the timeout in Minnesota. Their first and a half. 30-second timeout. O'Connor, part of that unbelievable Sean McVay coaching. Actually, unbelievable. If you're the third youngest coach in the league, which McVay is, I mean, only Mike McDonald in Seattle and Gerard Mayo in New England are young. And this guy has sent four guys who are former assistants to head coaching jobs right now. Brandon Staley was another guy who is with the Chargers now up in San Francisco under Kyle Shanahan. It's frankly astonishing. It is. It really is. And I think the energy that he provides, and a lot of the guys that have worked for him, they've learned from him, they've watched him. And, you know, that positive energy with the modern player can go a long way. And I think on the other side with Kevin O'Connell, you can see what he's been able to do with Wes Phillips and the quarterback coach Josh McCown with Sam Darnold using a lot of that same stuff. On the ground. You saw that graphic about every year of the last five, either a new offensive or defensive coordinator. You know, he made his own bed with that, right? He's so good training these guys, he loses them. How about Kevin O'Connell saying in the preseason when he would allow... Second and six. Inside handoff. Setting up a big third down now at the 17-yard line. Third and a couple. Jones carrying here. Jones has now carried 18 times tonight for 56 yards. Well, he accelerates, doesn't he? Great vision. He finds the hole and gets as much as he can out of that. Rams defense this year has allowed either 120 yards or more on the ground every game this year. Tonight against Aaron Jones, only 64. Third and four. Darnold stepping up. Throws going forward. Incomplete. Naylor was there. Could not handle it. Fourth down. that puts the linebackers in a really tough spot because you have to be aware of Darnold climbing the ladder or climbing the pocket here watch what he does and watch how he pulls the linebacker this is perfectly done, look at the linebacker's eyes, they're on him here he is right here pulling away from that backer backer's eyes are right there on Sam Darnold he baited him, made the throw, right on the money Naylor just unable to hold on record 35-yard field goal attempt up and good and that will make it a one-point game 12-47 left in the fourth, 21-20 about Conrad Williams being reliable for this Rams offense he's been running the football but he's been wondering what's been going on with this Rams offense well they've opened things up there's Bob cheering him home when he gets the touchdown and with those two receivers back it's opened up Matthew Stafford it looks like the old offense of the Rams you're used to seeing not just Stafford but 23 Kyron Williams having a great night tonight as well Stafford had three touchdown passes all season coming into tonight's game and he has three in the Rams, Stafford four touchdown passes tonight three in the first six games this year 28-20 Los Angeles tonight is the Texans and C.J. Stroud and company against the Jets. Now, I don't know if the game is going to be dramatic. We hope it will be. But there's always high drama with the New York Jets. Oh, yes. What else is new? They signed Riddick, right? Yes. Maybe Devontae Adams, Riddick. Now we go. Lots to talk about. Texans-Jets a week from tonight. And the Vikings now down by 8. Start at the 30. Kirk. Let's take a peek at our next-gen stats. Powered by 8 WS. And it's been a great night for Justin Jefferson. So many things he brings to an offense, whether it's man or zone, he has an ability to hurt you. And you know late here, Kevin O'Connell's going to try to find ways to get him the ball. Rams will probably put a corner on the outside, safety's on the inside. Kevin O'Connell's going to move him around right now, the nearest receiver who's moving already in motion. Jefferson now setting up on the left side. Darnold hangs in the pocket, throws. That's going to be a first down, and picking up a lot more is Josh Oliver, to earlier in the game. What a cutoff pass. You got a lot of man coverage, and this is a bust by the Rams defense. Either lose him or, you know, look at all the DBs. Look at everybody running with the guy. Nobody stays with Josh Oliver. And it was a slight delay. He was a little hesitant to get out, but I just don't think anybody ID'd him at the line of scrimmage. So he's able to slip out. Good job of finding in that time by Darnold. It's a great way to start this drive here. Two-yard pickup. Jones, workhorse tonight, 19 carries, 58 yards. Kevin O'Connell in his career as a head coach in Minnesota, 20-9 in one possession game. So he has a tendency to be able to hold on to some things offensively for this fourth quarter. Dancing around. Sacked all the way back at the 40-yard line. You have Burst coming in, and then Hoyt as well. Remember, Derisaw is out of this lineup. He's going up against Quezonberry, that left tackle spot. This guy's a rookie, but he is powerful. 76 is in at left tackle. and look at Burst just throw him. Again, that's a rookie just pushing him. And the athletic ability, you saw Darnold try to get out of the back door right there, but you can't run away from Jared Burst. So he's got power, he's got quickness, and Hoyt, he's fired up. There were sacks and there were sacks. That's a 13-yard sack. Makes it a third and 21. Under pressure again. steps up, fires nobody home fourth out these linebackers have allowed a lot of these in-breaking routes to get thrown in behind them but here on third down and long, much better job of getting depth here to take away the potential crossing route by Johnny Munt, look at the depth there there's nowhere to throw it he tried to potentially squeeze that in but just no one's open so the Vikings now forced into a position most likely have to use their timeouts on defense punt is fair caught at the 19 yard line by Xavier Smith 4-11 left to Justin Jefferson the night that he has been able to enjoy receiving yards over expected 47 over expected who I don't know if it's him or just your average receiver. I don't know either. So this kid's pretty special player. Has been for a long, long time and living up to it tonight. Look at that 31st game over 100 yards receiving. So the Rams now from the 19-yard line. Strong little clock pull here on the ground. Byron Williams. the Vikings have to think about using their timeouts on this side of the ball they're also, remember they're down one timeout they used one earlier, they got Gene putting one to Williams and Matthew and company will begin the drive from the 30 yard line he's got a touchdown, you see 10 straight games 16 touchdowns with his team he's got 10 of them and they go to work from the 30 yard line first and 10 with Corum starting in the backfield on his drive and a flag defense committee in formation. Five yard penalty. First down. Dallas Turner, the rookie, the number one pick out of Alabama was the 12th man, which is great if you're in Seattle, but not so great if you're here tonight. There they are. 12th right there. Dallas Turner, the first rounder you mentioned, with Van Ginkle, with Pat Jones and Grenard, it's been tough for him to get on the field this year. Brian Flores saying, hey, this kid's going to be a special player. But right now we've got three guys, and all three have five sacks, and they're playing great football at the edge. First and five. Stafford dumps it off for him. To the 44-yard line goes the Michigan rookie. It's so much fun to watch a quarterback that has the ability just to comfortably be able to examine a defense. Movement pre-snap to post-snap. Turns his back on play action. And then calmly already knows he's going to check this down. Let that defense, let them keep clearing. Let them keep dropping back. He knows already he wants to check this ball down and be able to pick up first down yardage. Rolling left. Firing. Caught to the 38-yard line. Hunter Long, who would be the number three tight end First target, first catch for him tonight. Just talked about the edge pressure. You can't lose contain here, but the scouting report doesn't tell you that Stafford at 36 years old is going to come out here on this levels concept. And as soon as he saw long there at that second level, right there, there's that quick throw, able to squeeze that in there. Coram to the 36-yard line. Ever Stafford came over. One of the biggest trades ever. I mean, he came over from Detroit. Jared Goff goes the other way. And how's he doing, by the way? He's doing really well. What a win last week. On the road against Minnesota. I mean, Goff would be right now clearly a contender for MVP and maybe number one. It is like a rare win-win for both teams. Right. Williams back in. Stabber protected well. It's Williams. Trying to stay in bounds enough to pick up the first down. Close. About a yard shy. Make it third and one. Well, this Rams offense has tried it. A lot of under center, a lot of play action. Been able to protect against the aggressive Flores defense. But you look at Flores' eyes, he's frustrated right now. That aggressive defense that we always talk about, because they're on schedule so much, it's not as easy to dial up those pressures. and they are can they hold them up a little short of the first down so the Rams brought everybody inside and the Vikings are able to just get enough pressure to stop them Van Ginkle did a nice job of setting the edge see him out here can't bounce it there's nowhere to go good push from Bullard 90 I think it's close enough. Stafford's athletic. You get under center. You sneak it. McVay was out on the field. I think he's saying, can we measure? The ref said, no, it's half a yard. Sean came all the way out. Stafford right up the middle here. No. Gets free. Williams after getting stopped in the backfield. Kyron Williams has just enough to pick up the two plus the two-minute warning. Brian Flores thinking about it. It's a three and out. Got to get off this field. Give our offense a chance. Give Jefferson a chance. Remember, McVay, his team has been so close. All these one-possession games. Lost to Detroit. Got blown out by Arizona. But a close loss to Chicago. Close loss to Green Bay. Here it is right in front of them. Up eight. 3.30 to go. Can they finish it? And the Vikings go to a good start in a situation where they really need a three and out, and they take their first of the two timeouts remaining right here. This offensive line has had a much better game than I think anybody who built up the pre-game hype would talk about or think that they would have. But now these first couple plays, a couple obvious runs, now they're third and long. The question is, if you're McVay, do you run the football and force him to use that last time out? Or do you roll the dice, play to win, and go through the air? I think he's rolling the dice. What do you think? Yeah. I think with a quarterback who you trust, with the receivers that you know can make plays, really it's really about trusting your offensive line to give Stafford time. Because if he has time, chances are he's going to find an open man. I mean, that would go a long way in being able to secure victory here. McCua set to the right. Third and nine. Now he comes to the left. Stafford looked that way. Stafford throws. Caught. Cup. To the 48-yard line. So Cooper Cup. starting with a couple of catches, very quiet since then. Big time play here, 27 out to midfield. Yeah, they get lost here in coverage with that motion. See two, watch two here. He gets a late break, then he doesn't find the football. That's Stephon Gilmore. So the motion, the stacked receiver, and then losing Cooper Cuff. Gilmore comes over late, by the time he comes over, he just can't locate the football. Good job working back, by the way, by Cooper Cup, back in the air, back to the football. Instead of waiting for it, he went and got it. We just said you trust your quarterback, you trust your receivers, and they probably got the chance to secure a victory with that play call. And forced Minnesota to use its final timeout. One clock stoppage remains at the two-minute warning. So, you know, Cup obviously in all of the chatter about a trade and some big-time receivers obviously have gone in deals over the last week and a half or so. But again, going back to what we talked about earlier, if you're 2-5, you're probably listening a lot more closely than a 3-4 in a game back with Seattle as your next opponent. And a reminder, they were 3-6 a year ago and won 7 of their last 8 to finish 10-7 and make the postseason. And now you're on the verge of going three and four, winning two games. There's less Snead. Winning two games in five days and you're healthy and you're talking about the potential of moving guys. I don't see it. Let's go win. If nothing else, the price just went up. Yeah. Keep it on the ground. That chews up another 40 seconds or so. Second down. So with a two-minute warning, a first down obviously ends the game. If the Vikings can come up with a stop, they're probably going to get the ball. Still got a long way to go out of timeouts. About a minute, minute ten to go in the game. So it's not over yet. Well, it's over in one sense. Yeah, I got you. I know you do. Of course you do. Got to get that in. Second and ten. Just staying in bounds here. does he stay inbounds? He does. The Kua thing, wait a second, I don't want to step out of bounds and give them some extra time, and that's going to take us to the two-minute warning. That's a heck of a job there by Murphy, holding off Robinson, holding the edge to that defense. Van Ginkle running. Again, Jefferson just looking at that clock, hoping they're going to get one more shot. so the next play with under two minutes to play and the Rams will have a third down and 12 when we come back to SoFi Stadium inning away first down and you know who he followed and I don't blame him Nakua 17 keeps saying it's not just about what he does as a receiver. I'm getting behind this guy. 6'2", 210. He's going to take on that linebacker. No problem. Finishes the block. That's beautiful. That's the overlooked thing about him, obviously. He's such a good receiver, you forget what else he can do. Johnson in motion. And this time, nothing happening on the ground. So full workload tonight for Williams. 18 carries, 90 yards. Brian Flores told me this week, he said, you know about Grenard coming over from Houston. Everybody wants to talk about his pressures. He's got 38. He's fourth in the NFL. But what I love about this guy, this guy's a lunch pail guy. Does all the dirty work. So make sure you talk about him being a two-way player. He olays the tight end, gets involved in that run game, and setting the edge. That's a beautiful play there by 58. Eight minutes left in the fourth. Circle of the guys likely to come. They all drop back. Stafford throws. Flag is thrown. And that's Cooper Cup along the sideline. They're going to have defensive holding by Murphy. Crowd is chanting Coop, Coop, Coop. And if it goes against the Rams, they'll go boo. Officials discussing it. Pass interference. Defense number seven. Ball before he's at the side of the foul. Yeah, he's here right there. He just grabs onto that hand. Tries to prevent him from getting around. And Metellus comes over to not allow him to get his feet down for the reception, even though he held on to the football. Rams have now picked up five first downs. Via penalties. And some big, like, critical moments, right? But there's been a third down or deep in their own territory. Now it's a matter of trauma-based. If you've got to finish drives. From the 16. Nice play there. That's Harrison Smith. Plays all over the place. Harrison Smith, right now, 35 career interceptions. this time he comes into the backfield. That's tied with Ty Matthew for the most among active players. What a career this guy's had. Yeah, he really has. Didn't even acknowledge the jet sweep motion. Speaking of jet, didn't even acknowledge the jet sweep motion that came around, just able to get around that left edge of the offense and get that tackle for a loss. Second and 11. The crunch time now here in this game. Williams threading his way, bowling his way to the 10, third and four. How about him weaving and patiently just kind of jump cut to next jump cut. He's now over 100 scrimmage yards in a night. That's 13th time in the last two years. That's the most in the NFL, going back to your point. When is the league and the fans around this league going to recognize number 23 out here in L.A.? It's the real deal. Without a doubt. 20 carries, 96 ground yards tonight. Caught a touchdown pass. Got him lined up on both on the left right here. Cut now out of the slot. Stafford to the end zone. Caught touchdown to Marcus Robinson. So Robinson tonight, two touchdown catches. Nice clean route by Robinson. You just kind of run out of things of what you want to say about this guy. Look, I mentioned the left. He's got his two receivers. He looks left. But now he's going to come back over here to find Robinson matched up against Harrison Smith. Zone coverage from the left. Step up, back to the right. And right between the safety and the corner, Robinson's able to separate for that touchdown. What a drive by the Rams there. Six and a half minutes. Ten plays, 70 yards. Six of them on the ground. Robinson, two catches tonight, two touchdowns. Joshua Carty for the extra point. And with 6'17 left in regulation. So the last third down we were talking about strategy. Do you run? Do you throw? We thought they'd give the confidence, show the quarterback Stafford a chance, let him throw it. This time we're out of timeouts. Two-minute warnings behind you. Now it's about you run it here and work that clock, or do you go one more time with Stafford? I run it, but they don't run it. Instead it's a pretty safe cup, just making sure he stays in bounds. And again, really close. They stopped the clock. Exactly. I think that foot must have stepped out of bounds. And he didn't get a first down. So now they have to punt, and that stops the clock with 1.53. Wow. Meanwhile, you know, Nakou almost went out of bounds on the prior play. Look at the blue cleats. Yeah, he's definitely out of bounds. They're trying to force him there, and they get him there. That's huge. 1.53 instead of down to 1.15 or so. Around that or less. So now you've got to punt with Evans. Brandon Powell back at the 10-yard line. Last time he put some good backspin on it. This time he's out of bounds. Just shy of the goal line. What a kick. Spotted at the three. He does it again. So that's two great punts by Evans. The guy we talked about, he's only had one touchback all season long. I mean, you talk about clutch. That is as good as it gets. He's done a great job, obviously, punting. He's the kickoff man. Phenomenal job there. And now all the Vikings have to do without a timeout is go 97 yards and make a two-point conversion. What a weapon to be able to pin this offense back. I'm keeping an eye on that left tackle. Well, Quezenberry has really struggled coming in for Derrishaw. Derrishaw, you know they're going to try to dial up pressure. Right now it looks like Byron Young will be across from him. They want to move the pocket away from that pressure. Put it to five. There's 95 yards to go. And that pass is underthrown a little bit. Falling down there was Jordan Addison, second down and ten. and a late flag has come in. A legal formation offense. Number 18 was not on the line. That penalty has declined. Second down. Nothing. Second down and 10. You know the Rams, Chris Shula, McVay, most important thing. I don't care that they're pinned back at their own five. with 1.42 to go. Where is 18? Rams are thinkering, pressuring over that left tackle, and where is 18 lined up? He's moving now from the right over to the left, all the way at the top. Darnold. Look out, safety. Byron Young. takes him down to the end zone Rams seal it add two and it's 30-20 I thought the face mask something happened to Darnold maybe he grabbed underneath and got to Jersey but something made Darnold his head go back with his pressure remember he said the left side is where this pressure is going to come from Fisk takes the tackle Young works through He got a hold of something there. Let's see. Yeah, he got that face mask. He sure did. Yep. And they cannot review that. But he definitely got the face mask. Right there. I mean, anytime you see a guy's head get spun backwards, something happened. And he got away with one right there. and Viking fans are going what the hell there's a lot of different things you can redo yeah there's Jones Jones saying hey man you gotta call that missed it wow the defense basically won the game a week ago and the special teams and the defense step up here in a big way late and of course Kevin O'Connor was fired up. The scoring plays a review but that's not a reviewable situation. Here's a really tight look to see it. Yeah it's a face match. That's just enough of it. Turned around puts him down.
