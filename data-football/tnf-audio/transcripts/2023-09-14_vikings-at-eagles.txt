 One of the concerns you have is Uta is now in a left tackle. You've got a backup left tackle, you've got a backup center, and you've got a couple guards that are still trying to find their way, and you're going against arguably one of the top defensive lines, if not the top in the league. Put pressure on on almost every play. Line does a good job here, and the pass is caught this time by K.J. Osborne. So it was second and 17, and they've turned it into a first down. Only their second of the game. Josh Joe makes the tackle, and they come up no huddle. You're going to see Kevin O'Connell try to mix things up. Anything he can do to try to get that defensive line on their heels, changing up that tempo. Madison, nothing. Bumble down his earlier carry. That's Jalen Carter, their number one pick out of the University of Georgia, who made his presence felt last week and thus so again tonight. Oh, man. Schlopeman, the backup center in for Bradbury, is saying, wait a second. First it was Jordan Davis out of Georgia, and now I get the rookie, Jalen Carter. I mean, everybody has just been talking about Jalen Carter since he was signed. Incredible camp. Very humble attitude. He's worked hard. Fitted perfectly into that defensive line room. And as skilled as anybody in the league. Rotating him in and out. That deep line. Pass caught on the outside. Short game here. That is T.J. Hawkinson came over in a trade with Detroit. Last year, Zach Cunningham makes the tackle. Third and eight. Yeah, that's the answer. Your only chance is you've got to move the pocket and you've got to get the ball out fast. Kirk Cousins is as good as anybody because of his experience and incredible prep at being able to decipher defenses and make quick decisions. I think Philly's answer to that will be tighten up the coverage and not give away those easy throws. third and nine cj ham comes into the backfield the fullback flare him out pass over the middle caught hawkinson on the run fights his way to the 17 yard line where evans makes the tackle first out for the vikings good job here is stacking him it gave him some space and he can win against his safety see evans has to play off see tight coverage on the receiver osborne because he's Stacked behind Osborne. It gives him some room to be able to work. And a good outside back to the inside move. And you can see Kirk Cousins with an entire offseason to work with Hawkinson in rhythm there with a nice throw on third down. 24-yard game. Only 17. Toss it. Madison. He has backed up Dalvin Cook. They let Cook out the door. Of course, he's with the Jets right now. And Madison's been the backup. Can he ascend? I mean, he's not going to be Dalvin Cook, but how good can he be? Well, he's a physical back. He's been around now. It's his fifth year out of Boise State. I think he runs tough. He runs physical. He's not going to be as explosive as what you saw with Dalvin Cook. Ty Chandler is backing him up. So, you know, in this era of NFL running backs talking about why aren't we getting paid, why aren't we becoming the focal point of offenses, Minnesota's an example of really relying on Cousins in the pass game. That was Avante Maddox coming out, holding his shoulder. Jefferson makes the grab, picks up the first down and sets up a first down and goal. You move him around. A lot of times he's out wide here. Really good job on first and ten, using him to be able to work across. Good action. Ran the football, come right back. Good job there of Cousins selling it. And then you slide him out there to the right. Tough for the defense to get all the way across the field. and make that play. You know, a lot of times you see that tight end make that route for these offenses. This time, one of the more electrifying receivers out in space. Three catches for J.J. 23 yards. The fake to Madison. The pass is caught. And Hawkinson. Bangs his way into the end zone for a touchdown. Broke away from Mario Goodrich inside the five-yard line. And so the Vikings, who have done absolutely nothing until that drive, have the ball for five minutes, go from their own 45 and in. Watch the defensive end, Derek Barnett. Watch the backers react just because you run a little bit. Just as Kevin O'Connell says, just be efficient. And when you're efficient running the football, you get players out of position on first and ten. Philly attacking, anticipating run. Easy for him to come off of that, get the ball out to the outside, and Hawkinson to the touchdown. Greg Joseph just barely boots that one through. So a 10.39 to go in the opening half. 30-yard line instead. They cough it up. Swift is the running back. Give it to him. What a good year with Detroit last year. to the 34. He goes tackle there by Harrison Smith. With Kenny Gainwell out of the lineup with rib injuries, Swift gets his opportunity. Didn't have a lot of touches or a lot of opportunities. Local product, St. Joe Prep here, a great high school program, and comes back from Detroit. Again, Swift. So they let Miles Sanders go. Gained over 1,000 yards. He's now with Carolina. Of course, everybody's the old cliche, running back by committee, but I prefer what Mike Tomlin says, distribution of labor. Right. And they sure have that, don't they? You've got four different guys that can carry the ball. With Gainwell out there down to three, it is nice. From the 38-yard line, called his number again. Swift, named 13 and a first down, another one. Tackled there by Harrison Smith. this play is designed to go up here but a good job by Minnesota clogging that so he's able to bounce this Lane Johnson to your far right see Minnesota works to the inside because they think that ball's going to the inside and that's a nice job with the vision by Swift it gives you an idea what he's capable of doing really created that play on his own all right on the midfield stripe four carries to 24 yards. For the first year, Eagle off the fake. Pressure. Hurts. Taken down. Bevy of white shirts. On that one. Led by Daniil Hunter. They were not surprised at all by that first and ten play action. You see again the rookie linebacker pace walked up into the line of scrimmage. Affecting the communication on that right side. Hunter doing a good job putting pressure off the edge. and then it collapses the pocket. Really a group effort there, and Brian Flores dialing it up, even on first and ten. Not fooled at all there after a couple nice runs by Swift. The play action doesn't catch him off guard. Seven-yard sack. Boston Scott back in the backfield on a second and 17. Set up a screen this time, but nothing happening there. Scott makes the catch. The Vikings are on top of him. Theo Jackson making the tackle. third and 16 upcoming. If you're a Vikings fan right now, it's only your second time to be able to see this Vikings defense this year. Good to see Metellus over there working and trying to work his way back. It's just obviously such a different unit with Brian Flores as the defensive coordinator. It was more of a bend but don't break type of defense a year ago. Didn't work out. Kevin O'Connell says, I really wanted to see more of a defense that matched my philosophy on offense, more aggressive, more attacking. so we went out and brought in Flores and these first couple weeks we're getting an idea of what they're capable of doing got his man third and 16 ton of time and then it's picked off by the Vikings that's Theo Jackson and he gets up and runs it back for a few yards to the 42 yard line so Jackson who got beaten on the long pass to Smith atones for that 3-0 with 2.51 to play in the opening quarter in Philadelphia. Just going to play linebacker up there tight, showing the pressure to snap of the ball. They drop. Remember, it's third and 15, third and forever. And this is just a mistake by Jalen Hurts. I mean, he just didn't even see him. He pre-determined where to go with his football, and it's a nice job of just sitting and reading the eyes that time by Theo Jackson. I'll tell you, the free safety, Bynum, If that's not picked off by Jackson, Bynum has a chance to maybe step in front of it. So just a misread there by Jalen Hurts on that third down and long. Hurts with only six interceptions all season long last year. Two ticks under three minutes to go in the opening frame. Alexander Madison is the running back from the 35-yard line. and Madison who takes over for Dalvin Cook and again the ball is out Eagles think they have it and we're waiting for the signal from the officials and it is Philadelphia ball so right off the bat two turnovers Justin Evans comes away with it and Madison fumbles yeah and it looked like Avante Maddox may have gotten his hand in there There's Jobe, and there's 29 right there. Yeah, it is Maddox who got his hand on that football. Everybody's going to want to see this. Just take a really good, close look. Make sure he's up. Yep, ball is out. And Philadelphia gets the second turnover. So three last week in the first half against Tampa. Two tonight on the road against Philadelphia. Their defense is playing well, but they're giving the ball right back to the Eagles offense. Five in the first five quarters of the season. so a short field now 11 turnovers in the first quarter over the last two seasons worst in the league from the 39 yard line now until he begins this drive hurts nowhere to go and when you defend this offense you've got to keep the edges to the defense This is a great play on the outside. Watch Jordan Hicks. You know, you can be red here. You can worry about the tight end out in the flat. Both he and also Harrison Smith, well-schooled on a short week to anticipate that extra hat with the quarterback run game. Both are in position there to force him back inside. Only a three-man rush. Eight drop back. Caught Brown. A.J. Brown in the trade of the year. Howie Roseman went out and got him from Tennessee last year, and he had a spectacular season. About as good as it gets. Between Brown and Jefferson, you're looking at two of the elite receivers in the league. Yeah, you make an argument, best tandem in the league, as you say, and they want to be able to hit their shots downfield. We saw Devontae Smith already make a play, but we're once again back to another third down for this Philadelphia offense and see how they handle the pressure that they've been dealing with. You mentioned Jefferson on the other side. I was just saying in this game. Oh, yeah. But you're right as far as the tandem is concerned. Yeah. With Brown and Devontae Smith. Third and five. And the Vikings are right there again to button up the middle. Jordan Hicks makes a stop. It's a rather impatient crowd. Well, obviously, no matter what the sport is, right, and especially this team went to the Super Bowl last year, week two, and they're already letting them know. It's just they're off right now. The execution is off. This defense deserves a lot of credit. They're attacking. Good to see Metellus back in there. Just trying to run a quarterback counter. By him delaying, it allowed Minnesota to get that penetration. 55-yard attempt for Elliott. He's already booted one tonight. And this one is off to the right and no good. So they can cash in. and the crowd says, what have you done for me lately? 42 ticks left in the quarter. 3-0, Philadelphia. Purdy back playing well. Wow. Wouldn't even know he had that injury sustained last year in the postseason. Elbow injury. Looked great. Meanwhile, Cousins is lucky he holds on to that. Had a problem last week as well, as Josh Oliver collided with him. The tight end. Man, oh man, they're having a rough time getting started. They sure are. And I think that time we talked about the interior. They got pushed right back into Cousins. Second and 15. Luke Hawkinson to tie it in into the slot. And a flag is thrown. Oh, and a free play here going deep downfield. Nothing to lose. And it's incomplete. Again, you got Slade there, but the flag was thrown, as you saw. Because Fletcher Cox was almost into the backfield. Why not throw it up to 18, right? Free play. You're looking around. Where's 18? It's going to take us to the end of the quarter. Here's Clay Martin. Offside. Defense. Number 91. Five-yard penalty. Remains second down. This is the end of the first quarter. Second and 12 when we come back into the first quarter. It's 3-0 Philadelphia. Now time for the world career of underarmeter after a very strange opening quarter. Second down and 12 as Cousins quickly gets to the outside. Hold there at midfield by Addison, the rookie. It'll be third down and three. I think that's more of what we expected to see from this offense is being able to get the ball out in a hurry. And Derrishaw is out. You look at this offensive line and communication and you get a drive like this going, it can open up your whole offense. Good news for the Vikings. Josh Metellus is back in the game. Meanwhile, Hurts will take it himself. Turns the corner. Picks up about eight before he scrambles out of bounds. They've already run the ball 17 times in this half. We just talked about how they're keeping the edge, and this time the corner. Murphy, he's got to be able, instead of jumping inside there, he tries to use his speed against Goddard. He's got to get to the sideline, race Jalen Hurts to the boundary, cannot let him get around the corner, or he's going to pick up some big yards. Second and a couple. again why not Boston Scott that's seven runs in a row 18 in the half nice job by the veteran Jason Kelsey they brought that late blitz here from Ivan Pace from one Bearcat to another he handles that and opens it up a nice job opening up that that right side seven straight runs yeah Ten plays on this drive. Nine runs. One pass. Swift back in there. He's moving around on defense. Hurts. Off his back foot just flings it away. Good coverage. Tended for A.J. Brown. Second down and ten. Brian Flores telling us this week, you know, when Jalen Hurts checks, we're going to check. It's almost who has the chalk last kind of thing between Brian Johnson, the offensive coordinator from Philadelphia, and Brian Flores with his defensive staff. That time, that was a win for Flores and the Vikings. Good adjustment. Nothing Hurts could do after that check, trying to get the ball out quickly to the outside. Pressure this time. Wide open. A.J. Brown. And a first down to the 17-yard line. Tackled by Cameron Bynum. Minnesota brings pressure, but then they sink. They don't want to give anything up over top for a touchdown, so they're willing to give some routes underneath. The problem is who you're allowing to catch the ball. In this case, it's A.J. Brown who knows what to do with the ball in his hands after. See how they just sink, drop in coverage? And then Jalen Hurts told us, he said, I just want to get the ball into the hands of my athletes and make them have to tackle my guys in space. From the 17-yard line. Cutting it back to Swift. You know, you talk about A.J. Brown. If you go to an Eagles practice, which we were at yesterday, and they don't have a uniform, you think this guy's an edge rusher. Wow. And then you see him next to Devontae Smith. And he's at the other extreme. 170 pounds. 6'1", 226. And Broad. To the outside. And a first and goal for DeAndre Swift. Jordan Hicks makes the tackle. 14 plays on the drive. 11 runs. What a great job here again. The vision. This play is designed to go inside. One of the few plays taken away. Bounces it back to the outside and across for that first down. That's 11. Carries for 59 yards. Quite a homecoming so far for DeAndre Swift. Ticking down to three minutes. Swift. Close. Stopped at the one. You know who's loving this if he's looking down from above or wherever? Woody Hayes. This is old school, right? Go no huddle here. Second down and goal. There they go. Are they going to push him in? They do that all the time. And this time a whistle sounds. No play. Play Martin checking. They called a timeout. Before the snap. Fire to the ball being snapped. Timeout. Minnesota. No first. 30-second timeout. Please set the game clock to 2.46. 2.46, please. Almost eight minutes off the clock. Second and goal. Are they going to push him in? They're lined up to do that. Yep. In there. Touchdown. Can't find that rhythm, despite having Jalen Hurts and these receivers, but definitely are controlling that line of scrimmage these last few series. Let's see what they do here. That play took a lot of time off the clock. Hurts is 9 out of 12 for 84 yards, 54 of those on one play. Second and six. Again, rush three, drop eight. Browns out of bounds with seven seconds. just nothing downfield especially on the edges Brian Flores dropping willing to concede and give up those short underneath throws playing a ton of zone again tonight keeping eyes on the ball and the threat the quarterback taking off and running I mean can you run a 12-13 yard out in 7 seconds and maybe He set up a 60-yard field goal. We'll see what he does here. He goes empty. Forget about it. It's just going to pad the stats for the first half. So they wind up with 133 rushing yards. And they take another time out. Now they may bring Elliott in for a long field goal. So you're looking at 61 yards. He's going to mark it at his own 49-yard line. He can do it. Yeah, I watched it down there watching him in pregame. He definitely has the leg. Career long 61-yarder against the Giants when he was a rookie back in 2017. So the next-gen stats tell us he's got about a 1-7 chance of making this. That's 16%. Minnesota, 30-second timeout. That's according to our next-gen stats, powered by AWS. And Minnesota takes its final timeout. It's like an NBA game now. Did you see when Jefferson reached for that and he couldn't quite do it, and they had the ruling and they reversed it, first thing he did, pat himself on the chest and say, that one's on me? I think that tells you a lot about the maturity. Fourth year, instead of arguing or debating things with the official, he just kind of said, he's going to own that one. Just frustrated with himself. Sure. He didn't have the presence of mind, but on a play like that, how can you blame him? 61-yarder is on its way, and it is good. He did it. Elliott a couple of field goals here in the half that one from 61 so they run run run run run set up a 61 yarder and take a six-point lead and that's how you use your driver that's your driver right there low and into the wind they're not mine baby coming up after the break state form halftime show. Line of scrimmage, that's been their adjustment and worked out well towards the end of that first half. Elliott to kick off. Boom, that 61 yarder at the end of the half. This drive will start at the 25. We go to Kaylee. Wow, both coaches acknowledge that they traded adjustments in the first half. First, it was the Vikings defense that adjusted and in the end, the Philadelphia Eagles offense figured out how to run that ball all the way down the field. Now Nick Sirianni said, hey, our guys work their butts off to get turnovers. They're relentless getting to the ball. But he did acknowledge that the Vikings put themselves in some difficult situations. And that's what Kevin O'Connell said was just crazy about that first half. He said, yeah, Minnesota controlled all of those moments, those self-inflicted wounds. He said, we have got to clean it up. But now he wants his defense to go create and get the ball themselves. All right, Kaylee, replay of the first half last week. They begin on the ground here. Nothing doing here for Alexander Madison after a game of a yard. I think the specialists, sometimes we overlook that aspect of the game. And if you're an Eagles fan, these first couple weeks, you've got to be pretty happy with what you've seen. Elliott, of course, week one against the Pats, 4-4. Great punting. Week two, we've seen that forced fumble on the punt, the 61-yard punt or field goal. Cousins loses the ball, and it's picked up. And down to the seven-yard line go the Eagles. Fletcher Cox. Well, Christian Derrishaw is trying his best to fight through it. In Philadelphia, the Minnesota Vikings take the lead 7-3. Hored by Fast Twitch Energy Drink. I think this Minnesota defense is, again, setting the edges, not giving up that big play of Jalen Hurts. Look at the different looks that Brian Flores is coming up, creating confusion and some doubt in the communication up front for Philly's offensive line. This is just a misread by Jalen Hurts and Minnesota able to capitalize on that and get that big turnover. Greg Joseph kicks off. Try to slow down that Philadelphia defense, and it really worked masterfully there on that drive. From the 25-yard line. Big hole through the middle. Gain of eight. DeAndre Swift sets up a second and two. Good night, Kaylee. Hey, guys. Right now, I'm watching Quez Watkins behind the Eagles bench. He just got up to the quickest jog I've seen him with. As he's been working out his right hamstring, he's got a heating patch. And he's back there. But otherwise been stretching, and it does not look like he'll be back in this game anytime soon. On the other hand, we just saw cornerback Avante Maddox for the Eagles head to the x-ray room. They were looking at that left shoulder. Yeah, he came out in that last series, and the Vikings took advantage of it. It's Swift who picks up the first down. Let's see Swift get his hands on the football. He's got a back that just had so much potential in his fourth year. Coming over from Detroit. really known early in his career as a guy that can be a change of pace back and catch the ball to the backfield. But watching him out at Georgia, you knew that he had plenty of ability to run the football. From the 35, Hurts checks it down. And there's the catch made by Swift. I think it's worth talking right now about Jalen Hurts and just trying to, he told us yesterday in our production meeting, you know, last year's over. We're trying to find a new identity. We have a new offensive coordinator, new play caller, a lot of the same bodies that were here last year, but it's a new year. It's a new team. We have to gel together. And right now, doesn't he feel just a little hesitant? Like he just doesn't quite seem to be playing in that comfortable, confident way he was a year ago. Not in rhythm yet. He was swift. Meanwhile, the Eagles gained 54 yards on that long pass to Devontae Smith. One play, 54 yards. On the next 22 plays, or the other 22 plays, they gained a total of 54 yards. Wow. Third and three. Swift picks up the first. And it feels like they're going back, you know, to this running game right now. and when they get Swift going, it's a good push here. You look at them overload there on that left side. They're just trying to get a big push, get behind the big fellas. Nice job by Landon Dickerson, Malata on the left side, opening that up, an easy first down. But I think they're still trying to figure out what Brian Flores is throwing at them, but they've got to hit some shots. You run the ball like this, you get the safeties down, you create some one-on-one chances, and you've got the receivers to go downfield. Again they called his number So the running game So remember Sanders they let him go to Carolina Game well they thought might be the number one back He could be He started last week but he had a rib injury, so that's why he's inactive tonight. Bring in Swift, bring in Rashad Penny, who looked so good so many times in Seattle, but just couldn't stay healthy. And now you got Boston Scott in the game. So you just, it's like a revolving door there, mixing in different players that they think all are capable. Second and seven. And this time they give it to Scott. And Scott picks up a first down. Boston Scott. Been with the team for five years. Came off the practice squad in 18. 5-6 and 2-0-3. Al, I think you would agree that in this first half, this is the first time they just said, you know what? We're not going to get cute. We're going to get behind this offensive line. We're going to control the line of scrimmage. And we're going to just get a push and rotate our backs. Do it again. Scott picks up the first down. That's one way to combat a team that's throwing a lot of gimmicks and a lot of different looks. You simplify things up front. You get out a hat on a hat. And you get a nice push. This is a veteran offensive line. Cam Juergens is in. You know, the only change that they had at right guard. But other than that, great injury at the left side. And he's going up against Josh Sweat, who's got a lot of speed off the edge. Good job there. Actually, Uda, who is in for Derrishaw, just not able to get to the outside. Just too much speed. Good hands there. And then closes fast with that club over the shoulder to knock the ball loose for Cox to jump on top of it. It was Josh Sweat. They are so deep and so good along that defensive front. Four turnovers. Seven on the season. First and goal for Philadelphia. On the ground. Swift. That didn't take long, but he gets only to the half-yard line. Second down and goal. Right back to that offensive line. And don't forget about the tight ends. That was close. Very. Sharon McCauley indicating he's a little short. Here we go. The push. The push. The touchdown. Jalen Hurst takes it in. That is almost impossible to stop. You know it's coming and you're not going to stop it. Not only, by the way, I don't know what he's squatting these days, but he's got as strong a legs as you're going to see from any quarterback. Watch the offensive line just dig down, get low. They're getting enough of a push by themselves. It's not as if they need Swift to push Jalen Hurts from behind. That offensive line is having a night. So the turnover, costly. Elliott for the extra point. And the Eagles go on top by a score of 20-7. A minute and seven seconds into the second half. The little feed goes down to Tampa Bay. And that scoots through the end zone. Kirk. Well, we were hoping to see Justin Jefferson against Darius Slade. It's all in the first play of the game. Deep crosser. Jefferson able to get some great separation. Cousins gives it a chance to be able to pick up that first down. You see an adjustment here. Slade so locked in. Does such a good job of prepping. Plays such a smart game. So I got a feeling now that Minnesota's down 13, you're going to see more of that matchup than we've seen up to this point. They can only hope. Top of the screen. Play action. Pressure on. Screen. Red perfectly. Zach Cunningham. Signed as a free agent last year in Tennessee. Before that with Houston. Watch the offensive line in the interior. I feel like they gave this away to allow Cunningham to read that. Play really never quite had a chance because of reading those guards led him to anticipate the screen being thrown. loss of 5 second and 15 swings it out that goes nowhere Madison just about back to the line of scrimmage you know last year Kirk this was a team Minnesota 11-0 in one possession games big come from behind wins this is called reverting to the mean right now absolutely they always seem to find a way but they play clean football for the most part Cousins threw some picks, but tonight it's been a disaster with the turnovers just like it was in week one. Third and 15. Cousins fires down the sideline and incomplete. Coverage is perfect. Addison, the intended receiver. Remember, this is still a team that was down 33-0 last year, so don't touch that dial. There you go. Just yet. Even though the Eagles are not that huge Colts. That Philadelphia defense, after the sudden change, great job. You'd think Minnesota's going to try to put a drive together instead. They get them to third and long, and they get a three and out. Ryan Wright sends it skyward. First and ten. Hurts. going to take off and not go very far. It's taken down there for a gain of one. Tackle made by Jordan Hicks. Second down. Just nothing downfield. Brian Flores dropped. Get his eyes. He's looking here. And in fact, at the very last moment after he steps up, he moves his safety there. And then he sees the one-on-one matchup. Kevin O'Connell went out in this draft and he said, we need to find a guy that can win one-on-one. And they found Addison as the guy opposite of Jefferson. That was textbook. That was beautiful. Great description of that. The kick is good by Joseph. So Minnesota trying to hang in there. 27-14, nine minutes to go in the third. 14-point game after the 62-yard touchdown on a third down and 10. That's exactly what Minnesota obviously needed was a big play. And, again, you've got to give Kirk Cousins a lot of credit for not panicking, not losing his cool. He knows that there's still a long way to go, and they're able to climb back into this game. Their defense has been playing well. One of the few times we saw man-to-man coverage, Jalen Hurts made him pay for it with that big throw to Devontae Smith. So see what Brian Flores adjusts back to now defensively. Hurts 11-14 for 147. Of course, those two bombs to Smith. Most of it. This time the pass is caught. gain of nine. Dallas Goddard. Down to Kaylee we go. Hey Al, right tackle Lane Johnson is on the field, but he was just doing some release work on his left groin. Remember, he had issues with it last year and actually missed some time because of it. The Eagles are without running back Boston Scott right now. After all that success on the ground, he's being evaluated in concussion protocol. We've learned Quez Watkins, the receiver, is out. And on defense, Avante Maddox, he's out as well. Yeah, that's why with Scott out, that's why we saw Rashad Penny, the ex-Seahawk, on the kick return. Meanwhile, Swift breaks one and a nice tackle to avoid a longer game there by Cameron Bynum. The flag is down. Yeah, I think the left guard landed Dickerson on a hold there. Holding. Offense number 69. Ten-yard penalty. Three plays, second down. One of the few mistakes we've seen by this offensive line. Left guard here just locks up Dean Lowry. Anytime you see a ball bounce, defender trying to work out. You can see him grab onto that jersey. Good call by the official. This is what Philadelphia dealt with last week. Making some mistakes, getting behind the sticks. Great look at Jeff Stoutland, the run game coordinator. One of the top offensive line coaches in the entire country. Or entire college games here in the NFL. second down and 11 the ball on the 23 yard line rush only three send it out the slip good tackle made on the outside there by Byron Murphy so third down and six coming up clock under eight minutes to go in the third Cousins says just get me the football back we want to get within a possession have a chance again to Keep that magic going from last year, those fourth quarter comebacks that he had. One thing you have to say about that is when you do it that often, you do believe. You do believe that you can do it. You've got 33-0. You can't believe in anything. No doubt. False start. Offense number zero. Five-yard penalty. Third down. Swift over-anxious. Tried to sell it anyway. Lost his balance. He jumps and then he acts like he meant to do it. Watch him point. No, no, watch the blitz. Blackies without a penalty tonight. But four turnovers. Third and 11. Again, just rushing three. Dropping eight. Pass goes to Goddard. Seen a lot of action tonight after next to no action last week. And that'll make it fourth down. Minnesota capitalizing on a few miscues here by Philadelphia with that holding call, the false start. Philadelphia goes backwards, and the Vikings do their job defensively, get off the field and give Kirk Cousins the ball back. Now down 13. Brandon Powell, former Ram. sets up inside his own 30. Aaron Sipas sends it his way on an angle, lets it bounce, and an eagle is the first to touch it, so it'll be down at that spot. 6-19 remaining now in the third quarter. Beginning of week two of the 2023 NFL season. Philly up 27-14. and deep. Third and nine. And that pass is incomplete. Over the middle. That's Jordan Davis who put the pressure on that time. Pass intended for Osborne. Fourth down. This is the problem with a backup center. He's going to work to his right to double team. The problem is you leave the big man, Jordan Davis, all along one-on-one against Cleveland. You can see he's big, but he's really quick, especially when he knows it's a passing down. The big fella gets in there in a hurry. I'd be like to make that throw with 345 pounds coming at you that fast. Probably won't be the only sound tonight either. Ryan Wright, his punt. This is Britton Covey drifting. Fields at the 9. Loses the ball, but the Eagles are right there to recover at the 10-yard line. Covey fumbled, but Philadelphia able to recover back at the 10, and that's where they will begin. their second drive of the night. 3-0 Eagles. Just learned he is questionable to return because of his right shoulder. You see him go down there. He has been taken back to the locker room, but that's not where he wants to be after fighting so hard to be a contributing member of this defense. No, just signed a contract extension last week and started last week against Tampa Bay and had six tackles. Meanwhile, that punt fumble was recovered by Keely Ringo. So Philadelphia maintains possession from the 10. That pass to the outside is incomplete. So Goddard was only targeted one time last week in New England, and already in the first seven minutes of the game, two targets. Yeah, right away trying to get him involved. Obviously such a big part. You know, Brian Flora is telling us this week that Metellus is a chess piece because he can do so many different things. Right now this is a defense that he has inherited, that they don't have superior corner play. They brought over Brian Murphy from Arizona, but they're still kind of finding that to become a strength. So in the meantime, the safeties have to step up. So a big loss with Metellus out. They go to Goddard again. Three times, two catches. That defense, of course, is problematic. They had to make changes. They brought in Flores. Last year they had the second worst defense in the league. Yeah, really. Yeah, the last three years have been really, really a tough aspect of this football team. And I think Brian Flores brings, as we know, a much more aggressive approach with his background in New England when he was the head coach at Miami. And you saw that last week in their opener against Tampa Bay. And I think you're going to see it again tonight against Philly. Boston Scott comes into the backfield. And a false start. Offense, number 65. Five-yard penalty. third down. Clay Martin makes the first penalty call of the game halfway through the quarter. Lane Johnson, the right tackle. Brian Flores is known with his reputation again with that background, especially on third down, being incredibly creative, very multiple, tries to give you a lot of different looks, wants to confuse the offensive line and the quarterback and attack the protection. Without having those great corners will play zone often behind that pressure look. Bunch three receivers to the right side. Hurts looks that way and takes off. Takes a hard hit at the 14-yard line from Jordan Hicks. So it's fourth down. And again, he's able to, he's got three-man rush. He knows it's third down and long. Let's take everything away downfield. Shows a little bit of pressure, but drops out of it. Now look at that. Russian three. Look at all those defenders. And everything's taken away. And as athletic as Hurts is, you're willing to give that up and just rally to the football. Playing zone. Eyes on the ball. Good job again by Minnesota's defense. Aaron Sipas to punt from the goal line. Brandon Powell collects at the 46-yard line. Swings to the outside. In the Eagles' territory. And a good run back. But then he coughs the ball up. Inside the 30-yard line. And the Philadelphia Eagles come away with the ball. Justin Evans knocked it loose. And Nicholas Morrow comes up with a recovery. It looked like a huge return, but a great effort by Evans to get this ball out. And how about the heads-up play by Morrow, who's starting tonight amid a linebacker for N'Kobe Dean. He jumps right on top of it to give the Eagles the football back. Minnesota done in by turnovers last week a bit away here with 6.09 to go in the quarter and the Eagles on top 3-0 they're about to start that drive plus territory at about the thing five defensive backs determined not to give the big plays up to Devontae Smith and A.J. Brown and even Goddard willing to just again you're going to either check it down or you're going to have to run the football and scramble and create for Jalen Hurts So as much as they want to try to attack downfield, I think they're going to have to hit some crossers over the middle. Middle of the field, behind those linebackers is open, but nothing right now vertically. Swift. His good night continues. He takes it to the 37-yard line. Swift has now carried the ball 14 times for 73 yards. And if you're watching him, for a Philadelphia fan, you've watched him at Detroit. A lot of times he's catching the ball to the backfield. What you're seeing is vision and patience. Even on that run, you know, to give themselves a chance here at third and four, that play looked like there was not much push. But instead of panicking and just powering through there, he waited patiently and cut back and found some positive yards. Third and four. Here comes pressure. There goes the ball. Wide open. It is Smith again. All the way for the touchdown. Jordan Hicks put the pressure on, but he got it away with Hicks in his face at 63 yards. And the Eagles go up 26-7. Great job here by Jalen Hurts. He gets pressure right here. Gets into his face. But watch this. I just talked about how these safeties are getting deep. This time Harrison Smith, he does it. Kind of holds his ground, opens up the back end, and there's the home run ball. Philadelphia has been looking for a one-on-one matchup that they can expose. He goes in 54-yard catches. The 63-yarder was the TD. 54 only took him to the 10, the two longest catches of his career. I believe how hard it is to score touchdowns. You know, college it was pretty easy. and he said he and A.J. go back and forth and talk about how tough it is. So he gets two tonight. Three on the season. Here's Ty Chandler. Let's go to Kaylee. Well, Al, A.J. has got two kids of his own. He's already given Devontae some fatherly advice. He told them, sleep when baby girl sleeps. You know, Devontae is known as the guy who turns the lights on in the Eagles facility. He's there so early every morning. A.J. said, yeah, we'll see if that continues. Yeah, we talked about it before. I mean, as a tandem, that's about as good as it gets. It's a one-two punch. Cousins fires. That's caught. That'll be a first down. Forward progress to Justin Jefferson, who holds in his sixth catch of the night for 69 yards. There's that matchup again with Darius Slay, giving him some soft coverage, of course, with his lead. He's comfortable in doing that. This doesn't want to allow him to get back. And a good job by Kirk Cousins. It looked like he was looking out to C.J. Hamm, and a flat came off of that and found the matchup that he wanted. Pressure, look out, hit as he throws it away. Gets it away anyway to Josh Oliver for no gain. That time Nicholas Morrow came flying through. Good, well-timed blitz here, and it affects the timing. Again, Morrow in for Dean, and he comes free. Offensive line moved to their left, freed up that right side. Morrow very close to getting to Cousins, and that's where Cousins, that experience, just smart enough to get that ball out of his hands. Cousins fires. And Jefferson can't handle it. Broken up. Big number two, Darius Slay, who had a pick six last Sunday at Foxborough. Every third down and ten. He was frustrated right when he came up. And this time Slay gets up a lot tighter. You can see right at the break he grabbed on to the jersey. That's the call that I think he wanted. Terry, you agree with that? It looked like a hold there, didn't it? It did. He clearly grabbed the jersey and restricted him. Should have been defensive holding. Nothing going right for the Minnesota Vikings tonight. Down by 20. Crowd roaring again. Third and ten. Pressure on Cousins. Steps up. Throws deep downfield. Caught! And that's the rookie, Addison, for the touchdown. Turned Jobe around. Josh Jobe covering on the play. And for the second game in a row, Addison is in for a score. This is the experience of Cousins. He's looking left the entire way. Wants to be able to throw, and then you get a one-on-one matchup here. But watch Kirk Cousins. Jackson makes the stop here. It'll be second down and goal. So you pay a penalty when you get to the Super Bowl. Both of your coordinators are gone. Shane Steichen goes to Indianapolis, and that man, Brian Johnson, who was on the staff, takes over as the offensive coordinator. Jonathan Gannon went to Arizona as the head coach. Meanwhile, a change on the defensive side for Minnesota. Brian Flores comes in as the Vikings' defensive coordinator. Second down and goal. Swift. Gain of one. So third down and goal now. Harrison Phillips, 97 in the middle, makes the stop. Brian Johnson, I think, is, we talked about in the open, he and Jalen Hurts telling us earlier this week that they're just trying to kind of find that rhythm. You know, last week was a tough start on the road. After that 16-0 lead, often they were deep inside their own territory, behind the sticks. It was very hard for them to be that attacking style you're used to seeing. And tonight, you can see in this very first drive, they want to get the ball downfield and be much more aggressive. 25 points last week at Foxborough, but only one offensive touchdown. Hurts is going to keep it. Cuts to the inside. He gets stymied at the six-yard line. So just like it was last week, again, deep downfield. Settle for a field goal, and Elliott kicked four of them last Sunday. Yeah, and this is where they obviously, in a game like this, where they're still trying to find that identity, They usually see Hurts get on the edge there with the ability to pull it, give it, or throw it into the corner. But the Vikings credit. They did not lose the edge of their defense there. Jake Elliott missed an extra point last week, but he was the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week with four field goals. Chip shot here from 24 out. Down the middle. Set up by that long pass to Devontae Smith. Cash in for three. Three-nothing Philadelphia. The waterbats can't tackle anything. Jalen, you know, he goes to the sideline. He brought it up in our meeting yesterday. He said, you know, when Brian Johnson was the quarterback coach, I was able to talk to him with Steichen worrying about being the coordinator. And here the very first time we see him on the sideline, there he is back to talking to Brian Johnson. So here come the Vikings. That means Kirk Cousins in his sixth season. A veteran guy who really, I think, gives them a chance to feel confident they can come into this environment off of a loss against Tampa Bay. Had the three turnovers early in that game, and he'd be the first guy to tell you how it's something that's unacceptable for him. He's got to make better decisions. 35 years old, 12th year in the league, 9th year as a starter. See how they try to attack this defense. It's got some guys out. We'll talk more about that. Yeah, six with Minnesota. Before that, of course, six with Washington. Start with play action. Pocket is clean. Pass is good. Up to the 41-yard line. And Justin Jefferson coming off a phenomenal season. NFL's Offensive Player of the Year stopped there by Darius Slay. So right off the bat, it's that Jefferson-Slay matchup. That's the matchup we all want to see. And he gets him on a deep crosser. If you really study Justin Jefferson, as much as he makes plays downfield, a lot of times it's these routes. It's those deep crossers, a sail route to the outside, and the very first play, a little play action, and they get him one-on-one, and he wins that matchup. Had a huge first half against Tampa last Sunday and then did almost nothing in the second half. Quick flip to him, and he can't escape that tackle. So Slay is right there to take him down at the line of scrimmage. Kevin O'Connell is the second youngest coach in the league, only Sean McVay of the Rams, who's in his seventh season. And he's younger. And O'Connell comes off of McVay's staff. Led this team to a 13-4 record last season. They made some changes. He wants to get bigger with some of his personnel groupings. You know, last year they were a lot of times just in the one tight end look, one back, three receivers. He feels that they have more versatility this year with some of the changes they've made. Second and nine. Hanging in. Throw as low as the pressure began to develop. Contended there for Alexander Madison, who's now the number one running back. You know, also, we should bring this up right away, Kirk. That offensive line for Minnesota is a makeshift line right now. Absolutely. And you've got to look how quick you see Sweat get off the ball here to be able to win. Boy, that's such a game changer. When you were a, think about an edge pressure guy, it's usually working around those tackles here with that blitz there from Cunningham. It allowed Sweat to work back to the inside to go against that line. You're talking about how the weakness to Minnesota's offensive line is the interior. And that's a terrific defensive line. Eagles are going to get the kickoff. Boston Scott is back. Greg Joseph descended skyward. And week two is underway in Philadelphia with the touchback. Out to the 25-yard line come the Eagles. Jalen Hurts was second in the MVP voting last year behind only Patrick Mahomes. Last week, there were the numbers in New England. The one touchdown pass to Devontae Smith. Ran nine times to 37 yards. Of course, he had that fabulous Super Bowl performance and a losing cause. Ran for three touchdowns, threw for one. DeAndre Swift will start at running back. Kenneth Gainwell started last week, but he is inactive tonight. Rib injury. And they start with Swift, the former Lion, going back and forth. And Hurts to throw to the outside. The 31-yard line game of six. Caught there by Devontae Smith. Nick Sirianni is in his third season as the Philadelphia head coach. Pretty good first year. Took one of the playoffs. Lost in the wild card game to Tampa Bay. and then all the way to the NFC Championship last year and lost by three to Kansas City in the Super Bowl. Second down and four. Pressure. Scrambles away. Can only get back just about to the line of scrimmage. Ivan Pace Jr. putting the heat on, so it'll be third down. third down, let's call it four. The rookie, Pace Jr., is really a great story. We'll keep an eye on him. He's got a chance, I think, to have a big impact. Undrafted, we see that every week. These players that play with a chip on their shoulder, and Ivan Pace Jr. definitely represents that, the rookie out of Cincinnati. There that look showing pressure We saw that last week from Brian Flores the defensive coordinator E Brown sets up on the left side Hurts looks that way under pressure Hunter chasing him Can he pick up the first down? He's closing. Yes, he does. Staying inbounds. Got hit before the line to game. Hunter chased him all the way around and out of the backfield. They pick up a first down. Yeah, they show you six walked up. Now last week against Tampa, they showed this look on third down. They dropped out of it to play zone. This time they're playing zone behind it, but they bring that pressure, and he's able to get away from that. There's that athletic ability to fight for that first down. Hunter had a chance to bring him down on that third down play. Okay. So a timeout is taken here. Meanwhile, what they did is they took Ellis off the field. Josh Metellus comes off the field, and the officials can stop the game when they see that somebody needs to be removed. word coming down from upstairs from the 37 yard line first down quick throw Goddard who didn't catch a ball last Sunday they only threw it on one time the much utilized tight end at least in the past makes the catch here for a game of a couple Nick Cerrani and the rest of the Philadelphia coaches said enough of the noise in Philadelphia about, man, and Goddard didn't even catch a ball, and Swift didn't catch a ball, and right away they want to try to get him a touch and get him into the flow, and of course he's one of the top tight ends in the NFL. The fact that he has the ability to play in line, he can spread out, as you just saw right there, and play out in space, but that time, great defense there by the Vikings. Marked him down behind the line of scrimmage, so second down and 11. play action going deep getting position and making the catches Devontae Smith threw it over the top of Theo Jackson who had to adjust still makes the grab and they send the ball inside the 10 yard line now watch Murphy pass Devontae Smith off to Jackson who by the way just came in from Metellus and right away Philadelphia challenges him going downfield. You can see Smith's speed. He goes right by him. He's in for a couple plays, and a great job by Brian Johnson tested him. Brown. In amongst a lot of traffic. Maddox, and you're right. He gets caught up, concerned about that pass potentially to the inside. The rest of that Eagles defense is playing man. Osborne goes to the outside, and Cousins, a great read. As much as he wants to throw the ball to Jefferson, easy read, throw it to the flat, big yards for that first down and into field goal range. Jefferson top of the screen, obviously slay on him. A little bit of off coverage. Cousins going deep left side, and that's incomplete. Intended for Jordan Addison, who was their number one draft choice, started his career hit, wound up playing his final year at USC. You know, when you have so many players back, Sean Desai, the Dune defensive coordinator, telling us yesterday that, you know, my two alpha leaders are Reed Blankenshape, the safety, and N'Kobe Dean. Both of them aren't out there. So he said, well, I can rely on Avante Maddox. Well, now he's not out there. Bradbury's not out there. Those are all starters. So, and you're going up against an offense that can be pretty complex with different looks. So it affects the communication. Cousins hanging in. Cousins deep. And it's pulled in, and the ball comes out, but he is out of bounds as they drop at the half-yard line, the beanbag at the half-yard line. Two officials now conferring one more time. I wonder if that could potentially be a touchback, him reaching for the pylon. That ball came out. Just depending on where they will determine where that ball is, That could easily be a touchback. Here comes Martin. Terry McCauley, real quickly, what are you seeing here? Al, it appears to me the ball goes over the pylon, which would put it out of bounds in the end zone. Right. It may not be definitive. We'll get some more looks at it here. They say it went outside the pylon. I don't see that. I think it's over the pylon, which should make this a touchback. Well, it's going to be reviewed, and I think this may come back just because of what you said. You can see it pretty clearly that the ball is over the goal line. It just has to get to the goal line, and it should be as we surmise it. After review, the fumble went over the pylon, which by rule is in the top. All right, Terry, interesting point here. You have to have possession of the ball as it crosses the goal line in this situation. For it to be a touchdown, certainly. Right. But he clearly loses control before he gets to the goal line. Right. And it does indeed go over the pylon, as we just heard the referee announce. for a touchback. So whether he has it in his grasp or not, it doesn't matter when the ball goes over the pylon and out of bounds at that point. Yes, if he's lost control, it's a touchback. Which it is. And that costs him a first and goal. And you can thank Terrell Edmonds for making that play and breaking it up. So with 34... Play clock at 25 seconds after a change of possession. Thank you. Play clock at 25. Game clock at 34. as the Eagles take over at their own 20-yard line. Think about these turnovers in this first half. Third one now. Two of them deep into Philadelphia territory that would have been points. The Eagles look like they're content to go into the locker room. Up 10-7. Austin Scott, game seven. Exactly what Kevin O'Connell did not want to see, right? I mean, last week, three turnovers, three in the first half. See if Hurst is going to air one out here. Nope. Scott. They're just killing him on the ground. So Boston Scott. That's a gain of 18 yards. Philadelphia takes a timeout. They've got 21 seconds. Trying to get it into field goal range. And we'll be back in 30 seconds. They were ready. They were content to just kind of kill the clock, and they pop off two big runs, and now they're thinking field goal. Right. Get a 20, 25-yard gain, and you're in business, especially with Elliott. Hurts me while just looking for the sideline, and he's out of bounds with 12 seconds. That's 125 ground yards for Philadelphia in the first half. Yeah, averaging five yards a carry. and they can't get the passing game. Again, he's over 100. Goes to a first on his 18th carry of the night. His longest gain is only 12 yards, but he's picked up 106 total yards. But watch this offensive line, led by Kelsey, climb up to the second level. Help out, get up to that linebacker. Again, that's two UC Bearcats going head-to-head, But the holes continue to open up as you wear down this defense. You get into the fourth quarter. Those holes seem to be getting bigger and bigger. Minnesota getting tired on that defensive line. Sooner or later, you knew you were going to see Rashad Penny. And it's sooner. There he is in the backfield. Second and one. First carry is an eagle. Takes it across the 50 for a first down. Tackled by Ivan Pace Jr. Under two minutes to go now in the third. And they don't have to do this with this lead. They're up 13. But if you're a safety and these holes are opening up, what are you doing? You're getting downhill in a hurry because you've got to be there for run support. If this game were closer, it would be a perfect time for Brian Johnson to put the ball into the belly of the back, pull it out, and create a one-on-one matchup on the outside where you could hit a home run to either Devontae Smith or A.J. Brown. Because those safeties right now are sensing that they've got to get downhill. caught on the outside that's penny well penny can stay healthy i mean we've seen him have some big big games with the seattle seahawks but the problem is he's just often injured yeah go back to 21 just a couple years ago he uh he led the entire nfl yards per carry over six yards a carry And you're right, it's been more about just trying to stay healthy and be that back that we all know he can be. In his sixth year now at San Diego State. Second and five. Penny again. Half a minute to go. Could let the clock run down all the way to the fourth. it'll be third down and three at the resumption of play in the meantime the Eagles at least going to line up for it maybe to try to draw them offside maybe to run a play third down and three they were able to do that that's exactly what they pulled off Harrison Phillips came across the line yeah they were they were ready to let the clock run down You called it, Al. Just trying to draw him off, and it worked. Neutral zone infraction. Defense, he's got a 97. By the way, Tully, he's both in a first half. You know, when you over-dramatize coming up to the line in a situation like that, and everybody's kind of moving around a little bit. Yeah. And sure enough, it works. Something's coming. Something's coming. You're right. That is the first Vikings penalty of the night. And you're going to wind the clock, and it's going to take us to the fourth. We have played three in Philadelphia. The Eagles on top of the Minnesota Vikings. 27-14 on Thursday. Great see. We'll talk about that in a second here. First and ten. As Hurts throws to the outside. He goes to Brown. You can see that Brown's frustrated. It is what it is, right? You'll have your nights, right? Yeah. Whose ox is getting gored? Meanwhile, here's Penny. Don't you think it goes back to... If anybody can talk about him saying, hey, the Super Bowl, everybody wants to pat me on the back. I'd trade that in. If we ran the ball like this, the way they're doing it tonight in that Super Bowl, and I didn't have big numbers, and we won, I'd be happy. And I just thought it was neat he was going to tell that to his team. Just nights like this for A.J. Brown. You would know as a quarterback, sometimes you've got to be a babysitter for your wide receivers. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's the heat of the moment, competitive spirit, that fire that makes them so good. third and nine rushing three most of the night and this pass is caught but a little short of the first down Smith tackled there by Jackson they're going to mark it at the 27 and make it fourth down and one this is the best he's looked tonight I know he's got a couple touchdown passes but this is a great job with the eyes middle of the field, works back to the right, timing, rhythmic, nice throw. Push him, first down. Again, you run that push play and it's impossible to stop. Meanwhile, Hurst has been fantastic. And the Vikings trying to get all the way back in it as Madison picks up four, tackled there by Mario Goodrich. All things considered up front for Minnesota. They've had an uphill battle against this Philadelphia defensive line, but doing a good job of trying to mix these play calling up. Rolling, has time, throws caught, but well short of the first down. Jordan Addison making the grab there, third and short. Seems like when they have gotten the Eagles on their heels, it's been a mix of change of tempo. moving Cousins around. Anything to slow down that front. Third and four. Cousins hangs in the pocket, and the pass is incomplete. The coverage is great. That was Jefferson over the middle, and he was covered by the linebacker, Zach Cunningham. Four down. You know, Al, it looked like Fletcher Cox may have gotten his hand potentially on his shoulder as he releases the ball. I know he got right there. It looks like he got a good push on him. Remember, Cousins gets hit more than anybody, and that may have affected that. But I'll tell you, great coverage there by the linebacker Cunningham. Right. We're talking about getting a linebacker on Jefferson. You want to take advantage of it if you can. Ryan Wright. Covey's going to let it bounce. and so will the Vikings all the way to the 8-yard line. Devontae Smith has had a couple chances to get out and show you how many yards he has traveled. This is early in the game. Looks like he may score a touchdown. Ball under thrown. What an adjustment. Able to climb up and make a great play. And this is where he got man-to-man. Just went right by Evans. And that's where Jalen Hurts got pressured. You can see that was a nice 70-yarder. But when he gets one-on-one, he's as good as anybody creating those favorable matchups and getting the separation. 57-yard kick. Spot the ball at the 7-yard line. Through the middle. Working his way out to the 11-yard line. gain of four as that run game continues for Swift. Heavy workload tonight, 15 carries, 77 yards. Really impressive to just watch him tonight. You know, it's one thing, the way Gainwell played last week, you think he's going to become the guy. I think many people thought that Swift would come in and have a role, but many wondered what it would be, and with Gainwell being out, They've asked him to carry the load, and he's had a heck of the night with that offensive line paving the way. Paves it again. Breaks tackles. To the 20-yard line he goes. Tackled there by Cameron Bynum of a block by Jordan Malata. The left tackle, first down. Yeah, Malata, the left tackle, 68, 89, a good kickout. Jack stole. You see it puts a lot of pressure on these saves. Look at that hole. Look at that hole. And the safety's collapsing down in a hurry, which they've been doing against this run game. But he is so, he has such good balance, physical lower half, able to stay off and bounce off those safeties. From the 20, Hurts, tied, throws, caught. But again, only a short game. This time it has got it again making the catch in for him. I mean, he's caught six tonight, but for only 21 total yards. Yeah. Quiet night. It's been more really about this running game, and you can't blame him. I mean, for a league which is about 60-40 pass-run, the ratio there, Phillies run the ball 32 times and thrown it only 20. Second and five. Run number 33. Effective again. First down. Gang tackled up at the 36-yard line. DeAndre Swift. But again, I think it's, you go to what's working, right? On that night. Some nights it's throwing the football. Other nights it's the offensive line controlling things. And these are big holes that he's running through. I mean, you're asking linebackers and, again, the safeties to come down and make plays. And this guy's 5'9", 215 pounds. it gives you an idea of low center of gravity that he has. They've run that play a few times, haven't they? I think you've got to go back to your earlier days on Monday Night Football when the last time you saw a drive like that. Yeah, for sure. That's not something, as you said, in today's game you see at all. but I think they felt that they were opening some nice holes up for Swift and of course once they get the short yardage so often they go to the sneak with the push from behind to get him in. Yeah, the competition committee looked at that. It's an ugly play, it really is. You push the quarterback in. They thought about taking it out. They're going to look at it again next year, but for the moment it stays in. It is ugly though. Except you're an Eagles fan. That's beautiful. Extra point is good. 244 to go in the opening half. At the link, Philadelphia retakes the lead. 10-7. Driver, all he did was run the football all the way down the field. Light breeze. 10-7 in favor of the home club. And we go to Kaylee. Al, Jalen Carter entered this year's NFL Combine as the projected number one overall pick. But then news broke that a warrant was out for his arrest. In January, Carter allegedly drove in a street race that resulted in another car crashing, killing his college teammate and a Georgia football staff member. Carter pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of street racing and reckless driving. He received 12 months probation and still has two pending lawsuits against him, but that helps explain why he dropped to the ninth pick and landed here in Philly. Yeah, no question about it, otherwise you're right. Might have been number one, certainly would have been picked before number nine. Meanwhile, the catch is made in a 14-yard game here for Josh Oliver. Came over from the Ravens as a free agent. Continue to see different formations. Continue to see the bootlegs. Continue to see the ball out quickly. Really nice plan here with Kevin O'Connell. How to get away from that defensive line. You just saw Jalen Carter. So many talented players up front. Little handoff here. Madison's going to fight his way to the 42-yard line. Clock ticking down to the two-minute warning. And the clock will reach that two-minute mark. And it's second down. Where would they be without him? Absolutely. Gone. Second down and six, B-1. With the two-minute warning. Cousins throws and that's caught a little short of the first down by Hawkinson. Hawkinson having a nice night tonight, hitting the matchups underneath. Remember, they've got some backups in it. Safety and linebacker tonight in this Philadelphia defense. And Hawkinson underneath has been tough for them to match up with. Third and one. Cousins 10 of 12 for 88 yards. most everything's been pretty short except that 124 yard to the Hockinson crowd in full throat and the pass to the outside is caught and it's Jefferson to the 50 yard line forward progress stop there Slay makes the stop clock ticking down to a minute fun to watch Kirk Cousins a veteran and make calls, get the right matchup. You can see him move Justin Jefferson out, even with Slay across him because of that soft coverage. Easy throw. Vikings have two timeouts. Sliding to his left, the pass is incomplete. From Madison coming out of the backfield, covered there by Brandon Graham in his 14th year in the league. So you've got Brandon Graham, you've got Fletcher Cox, you've got a lot of young players. You've got Josh Swepp, but on the back end, Right at the linebacker spot. N'Kobe Dean was expected to step in. He's out with a foot injury, so Nicholas Morrow is in. Zach Cunningham was signed as a linebacker. He's only been here five weeks. Got a lot of injuries on the back end. Mario Goodrich is in for Avante Maddox. He's got a new defensive coordinator in Sean Desai. This is not the same team that played the Chiefs in the Super Bowl defensively. And Reed Blankenship is out. He would have started. Yeah. Meanwhile, the timeout is taken here with 52 seconds. 10-7. So Minnesota down to its final timeout. 52 seconds. Rush 4. Pass to the guys out. Wide, wide open. And turning it into a nice game is K.J. Osborne. Some attention being paid to Jefferson and to Addison. They forget about this guy. Yeah, and Goodrich is in again from the guy. He and Patrick Mahomes and Mariota did that. I enjoyed that. A lot. I think you're right. I think we learned a lot about all three. We did. But we... Full start. Offense number 88. Five-yard penalty. Fourth down. Just quickly, I think because of what Cousins goes through, At his age, he got hit more than any quarterback in the league last year. And to see how he puts himself back together is pretty remarkable. You see Goddard there moving. And now they will punt the football right at midfield. Looks over to the bench. What do you want me to do with this? Kick it out of bounds? tell me what. Pooch punt it. Eagles don't want this game to end the way the game in the middle when it went to overtime. Everybody kind of looking around going Minnesota did decline the 10 second runoff. Fourth down. Yeah, you're definitely going to deny the 10-second runoff in this particular situation. So Brandon Powell is back. We get an opportunity to do something with it. He will. And can't go very far, though. Tackled the 17 with seven seconds. Ringo makes the tackle. So one desperate prayer, which they had answered when they played in Buffalo last year. Remember that game? Oh, my gosh, yeah. Well, you know Justin Jefferson is going to get all the attention of the Philadelphia defense, but this will be one of those plays you're setting up the different laterals to try to throw the ball back, just keep the play alive here. We can activate Case Keenum for the Minnesota Miracle here. Likely the final play of the game, barring a defensive foul. But before that, folks. Timeout. Philadelphia, their second. 30 seconds. This is the NBA. This is the last two minutes. It's a half an hour. Thank you. The Stanford Band is out on the field. Cousins. See what he's got in him. He's got a one-man rush. As far as he can throw it. What's going to go on down here? Not the way. Jefferson in the neighborhood. And that's going to do it. not pretty as you say. I mean, they can play better, and they will. But for the moment, that team of Nick Sirianni is 2-0, and the Minnesota Vikings are 0-2 as we begin week two of the NFL season. Hang in there. Carissa and the gang all set. They'll wrap things up from Philadelphia. It's the JCPenney postgame show coming your way on the other side of the break. On third and one and fourth and one over his career. Yeah, I saw the graphic this morning in our meeting, and I think he missed one time, and I was thinking, well, I'd love to see the film on that one time that he didn't make it on fourth and one, because every time I think back to last year, look at poor Harrison Smith. He's just jumping on top of the pile, going for a ride. fourth and one last year ten rushes nine first downs one for one tonight two minutes into the fourth from the 25 yard line nice blocking along the front there passes to Brown with a touchdown but a flag is down back in the 33 yard line Al they're going to get Rashad Penny He picked up the blitz. Offense number 23. So penalty replay the down. It comes back. Right here, blitz comes up the middle and maybe caught him off by surprise. A good effort again by the rookie, Pace Jr., to get around him. That caused the penalty and the hold takes away and negates that touchdown. the Eagles haven't seen that in a while because the Vikings tonight have been rushing only three on a lot of pass plays Minnesota doing the best job they can to rotate bodies Not a ton of depth but the time of possession Usually that's not a big stat you think about in an NFL game. But the way this game has gone, time of possession. It's like 33 minutes to 13 favoring Philadelphia. They're just keeping the ball away from Kirk Cousins. Mattelis got caught up in the wash that time. He was a little slow in getting up. Had to come out of the game earlier. First and 20. Off the fake. Going deep again for Brown. Can't make the catch. Crowd looking for a flag. No. Get none. Evans covering on the play. Got burned earlier. He finally had a chance. You just talked about A.J. Brown. He walks over to the sideline. A little slant and go. He beats Evans. He's got him. He's got a chance. And that's what the fans have reacted to. They are. contact occurs. That's too tight. They just don't call that as pass interference because in real time, it's bang-bang. I'm with you, man. Evans there getting worked on. Right. Second and 20 from the 35-yard line. Hurts a ton of time. Surveying. Now flushed out. Finally taken down. So that secondary did its job. That's to Neil Hunter, who had a big rush early on. Pretty quiet since then. Of course, they've been only rushing three. Yeah, rushing three and dropping eight. Look at the top of your screen. One, two, three, four, five defenders back there. Take away the underneath. Eventually, there's a receiver that opens up, but Jalen Hurts is running for his life. So, you know, the previous play that we were looking at, it was a close call there. That was, again, a rare man-to-man opportunity that he just missed for the touchdown. Third and 23 now. Hurts. There's Hunter again, and this time he takes him down back at the 50-yard line. Great play by Daniil Hunter. Ninth year out of LSU. Great career. This is a combination of a great effort here by the big man. Had such length and quickness. last year, of course, ten and a half sacks. You can see he's almost just easing his way up, respectful of the speed of Jalen Hurts, then works his way around, and there's that length I was talking about. Doesn't grab the face mask and brings him down. That's a good job by coverage to free him up to get home. 12-yard sack, and that took him out of Elliott's field goal range, so Sipas is in to punt. Fair catch, call for made, 14-yard line at that spot by Brandon Powell. 11-19 left in the fourth. The Philadelphia Eagles trying to go to 2-0. Leading the Minnesota Vikings 27-14. Again, trying to hang in there. 27-14 is the score. Meanwhile, Hunter with that sack has three in the game. DeNeal Hunter had one last week, so four on the season. I would imagine the league leader at this point as it's Madison. who takes the toss there, tackled by Morrow for a gain of eight yards. It feels like the game's over, but they're a touchdown away from this being a one-possession game. You know, you've got 11 minutes to go. If Cousins, being the veteran that he is, can lead them down and score, that was a potential knockout punch drive for Philadelphia, and they missed that opportunity. Give the ball back to Cousins. You've got Justin Jefferson, right? Right, right. Anything can happen. Addison ain't bad either. Second and three. Cousins fires. That's caught. And then dropped at the 40-yard line. K.J. Osborne starting to look upfield before he looked it in. Incomplete. Third and three. And Justin Jefferson with a nice sail route clears this middle of the field. Wide open. He's right in front of him. He'll work inside. Back to the outside. He's one-on-one. Just what you want against Edmonds. of safety. I don't know if he started thinking about what's in front of him, but he just loses his focus and a big gain potentially for this Vikings offense. Third and three. Cousins. Floats it. Caught. Jefferson. Wiggles his way out to the 45 yard line. Josh Sweat came in, buried Cousins as he threw it, But a big gain there of 23 yards. Meanwhile, you've got the injured Viking here. That's Udo, the right tackle. So injury timeout. 27 to 14. To protect the line side. Against this defensive line. Madison. Nice run here. He takes it to the 50-yard line. Gain of six. Second down and four. Down to 10 minutes to go in regulation. And you and I talked about when this drive started, Philadelphia's offense misses an opportunity to potentially put this game out of reach. Off the fake. Fires. Caught in traffic. Jefferson. Great grab. Covered well. Takes it down to the 28-yard line for a Viking first down. Good job. Play action. Run to football. You go back to the play action. You max protect to give Cousins a chance. And go to your go-to guy. Pretty decent coverage actually there by Slay. Well-thrown football on a line. And great concentration by Justin Jefferson. You always think about him making those big plays there. He shows you the strong hands and concentration. That's eight catches tonight for Jefferson. 115 yards. They're at the 28. Look out. Flips it away. Incomplete. Wouldn't have gone anywhere had he caught it. That time Josh Sweat had a forced fumble earlier. Creates that second down and 10. You don't realize how big Sweat is who's coming off the field until you get down in the field and look at him as a pass rusher. 6'5", 265. Going back to last year, they're trying to hope that that trend will continue this year and starting tonight. Those big comebacks. Minnesota, despite all those wins last year, The 13th gave up more points than they scored. Second and 10. Swing it out here. Nice move all the way to the 24-yard line goes Ty Chandler. Second-year man out of North Carolina. Big third down upcoming. Obviously thinking about four-down territory at this point in the game. Under nine minutes to go and down 13. Kind of opens up the playbook. You don't have to work downfield. Now you have Jefferson and Addison, and Hawkinson early in this game was winning matchups underneath against the linebackers. Third down and six. Jefferson comes in motion. Comes out of the slot on the left side. Cousins hangs in there, throws, caught at the 10-yard line. And Jefferson, they can't stop him. Mario Goodrich covering on the play. First down. How did you notice on the motion? Goodrich, who's a backup nickel to Maddox, he's late in adjusting. This is Jefferson, right? Where's the adjustment? The linebackers are calling for him to come over. You're going to give him that look at this point in the game. That's stealing for Kirk Cousins, throwing to his guy. Jefferson happy to get away from Slay. Takes it right to the 10, so it's a first and goal. play action look out from behind throws wide wide open is k.j osborne for the touchdown josh sweat came in got there a little too late and osborne for the second time tonight you talk about out in space well here's outer space here's josh job remember all the backups that are in because of the injury quickly he can accelerate man this guy is a good looking back in a crowded backfield. Back in Philadelphia, where he grew up and went to high school, got to be fired up for the night he's having. 165 on the night, 43 on that. Through the middle, pushing his way toward the goal line. First and goal. The Vikings really now in no man's land. They've got their time out. What do you do at this particular point? They've got all three. It's second down and goal. Then they're going to take their time out here. You're between a rock and a hard place right now. I'll tell you what. Looking at a victory. Second down and goal. You have to win and be sexy. What can I tell you? To the outside. And then to the inside. Touchdown, Swift. So they took the ball at their own 25-yard line, took them only eight plays, three and a half minutes, to make it a two-score game. 169 yards for Swift. got him in your fantasy league you're thrilled Elliott for the point after 413 to play in the fourth it's only fitting that the young man who grew up went to high school here at St. Joe Prep was having this kind of night and again how great is that run I mean it's a whatever it was a one or two yard run but it kind of shows what he's done all night that play is designed to go right behind Jason Kelsey, who's taken away, and this kid is showing you the vision and patience that he has. He's not just a guy that's going to catch the ball in the backfield. He shows you he can run the football. He's showing you different ways. He's had a heck of an eye. Good for him. Okay. All right, yeah. Okay. Very, very good hands. Take your hand. That's dropped. And I think that created such consternation in Boston because there's a little provinciality up there when it comes to medicine. And Tom Brady said, I got this young guy out in Los Angeles. How about that? And I'm going to him. And by the way, when Colby Bryant tore his Achilles with the Lakers, Colby at 11 o'clock that night was home and called Dr. Eletros and said, you've got to do me tomorrow. Wow. That's great background information. and all of us pulling for Aaron. Love to hear that. I'm sure the surgery went well, and can't wait to see him fight back to get ready for next year. Oh, what a catch. Again, taking it away from Slay, who can hardly believe he gave up the completion. Under four to play. It's pretty good concentration. These guys have been going back and forth. Slay's won a few. Got away with a little hole there at the top of the route, but somehow that ball gets in there to Cousins with a great throw. Dozens, little shoulder shake. Madison makes the catch. And Madison would help him to get out of bounds. And he doesn't. He stays in with three and a half to go. And there's a flag down on the play. Pulling. Offense number 75. Ten-yard penalty. Three-play first down. And this offensive line has obviously had their hands full on the far right. Brian O'Neal going up against BG. Brandon Graham. One of the first times we had a chance to call his name in his 14th year. Did he light up the room yesterday when he walked into that production meeting? Always does. I mean, how great is he? You know, I thought he really told a great story about the Achilles injury himself that he had in 21. and then to fight back last year, how determined he was to be a part of this franchise and how grateful, honestly, he is at this stage of his career to try to get back to that Super Bowl and this time win it. Watch him on this crosser and watch the hesitation. Do I go with him? Do I stop? And that's why there's the bust. Remember, you're playing a lot of guys that haven't played a lot of football. Joe Binford, Bradbury, not quite sure on the call. Do I follow him across? Ends up freeing him. Nobody picks him up on the other side. Extra point by Joseph. It is a one-possession game about halfway through the fourth quarter. Good one in Philadelphia on the season premiere of Thursday Night Football. Eagles up Philadelphia right now. 27-21. Eagles to get the ball. 7.41 to go in regulation. Joseph to send it down to Rashad Penny. Eagles running game has been tremendous tonight. They have run for 191 yards. They've done such a good job. The backs are going to get a lot of attention, but it's been the offensive line. I mean, look at these holes. It's really been from that one drive where they just went to link to the field, running the football throughout the rest of the game. Great job up front, great push, great communication because Minnesota's moving around so much. But now we've got a six-point game. This is going to be a different energy from the Vikings defense. Running game clearly takes a lot of time off the clock, too. They start with a seven-yard run. I've never seen numbers like this. Their last drive, Philadelphia's last drive, 15 plays for 44 total yards, nine minutes, no points. They had a first and ten at the Minnesota 25, ended up punting from the 49. Yeah, holding call and then two sacks by Jalen Hurts. I've never seen it. 15 yards, 50 plays, 44 yards, 9 minutes. What did you say about Woody Hayes earlier? That sounds like a game from the 50s or 60s. Oh, yeah. Three yards and a cloud of astroturf or whatever it is they're playing on these days. The 36-yard line, Harrison Phillips makes the stop here. First down. Brian Johnson sticking with that run game. It's been consistent. All reliable tonight for him. Not only effective, but also, as you said, Al, just a moment ago, working that clock. Hikings linebackers and safeties, again, are going to have to keep cheating down to help stop that run game. Outnumber them up front. To the outside, Swift. Gets hold down there by Joshua Thomas. So that is the 41st run of the night. They've run for 205 yards. They've had the time of possession, of course, ridiculous. You know, 36 minutes to 17. That's what the running game obviously does for you. Brian Flores has been surprised he's seen so much 12 personnel, meaning one back and two tight ends. You know, Philadelphia last year, team that would mix it up but often would be with one back and one tight end. They've been in a lot of the two tight end looks to give them the extra gap. So on second down, Swift for a couple. Third down, of course, they're taking as much time off the play clock as they can along the way here. Interesting call here for Brian Johnson. A team that last year would often go for it on fourth and short. But at this point in the game, up six, if they don't make it here and come up a little bit short. See what they do. Third down, five. Let the play clock run down to six. Hurts throws. That's caught. That's Brown. That's a first down in Viking territory to the 46-yard line. Nice timing here. Jalen Hurts, the last few times he has thrown the football and gotten it out of his hands. Watch on the left. Watch him work off the leverage of the linebacker. It's actually a big defensive end who's out of position. See 98 there at Wanham. You take that all day against A.J. Brown. He doesn't really have a good feel for space out there. And on third down, makes it very easy for Jalen Hurts to go to one of his favorite targets. On the plate clock down to 7 again. Swift. First down. And a lot more. Inside the 20. Inside the 10. out of bounds with a first down and goal. The left guard, Landon Dickerson. Watch the push over here. Watch him get up. Really just open this play up. It's a continuation of what we see. Malata gets up to the backer. And then Swift, who's been somewhat at times hesitant, waiting patiently. This time he shows you when he sees it. Screen on the first and 20. That's Ty Chandler Second and long Zach Cunningham in on the tackle Of course, you know, you have the Philly special In the Super Bowl against New England And of course on the other side You had Graham's strip sack of Tom Brady To cement the game late So there's a statue outside the stadium For the Philly special There could be one for the What about him? Second and 15 He appreciated you talking about that Cousins throws through the hands of Madison. Third and 15. Big drop there. Fletcher Cox still playing. Speaking of veterans, that's what makes this Philadelphia team so, I think, dangerous is you have the combination. The ball goes right through his hands. Combination of guys like Graham and Cox and Sweat, these vets, with so many young players like Jalen Carter and N'Kobe Dean when he gets back. Nolan Smith. Third and 15. Caught in the 35-yard line. Coming up three yards shy of the first down is T.J. Hawkinson. So fourth down. Vikings up to the line of scrimmage. Cousins trying to get the play call. Still have two timeouts plus the two-minute warning. But have to convert here. Fourth down and three. Cousins fires. Caught. Open. Goes to the tight end. Hawkinson to keep it going. Ball in Philadelphia territory now at the 46-yard line. Morrow makes the stop. Cousins trying to get this snap off before the two-minute warning. Trying to get an extra play in here. 3-2 gets it off. Final play before the two-minute warning. Hits Madison. Nice move to the 30-yard line. And that's where they'll pick up a first down with 155 left in regulation. that firepower, but Mac Jones with Bill O'Brien. We're going to keep an eye. They came last week against Philadelphia. They were competitive. I think Mac Jones is going to fit perfectly with what Billy O'Brien wants to do. That's a team to look out for, kind of a forgotten team. No question. In that division. Kind of funny, last year that Matt Patricia, who his pedigree, his defense, was the offensive coordinator. Matt now here in Philadelphia as a special assistant. I'm sure we had a few little words of wisdom for the Philadelphia coaching staff going into the last week's game. No doubt. That was a heck of a game, actually. It was. So two timeouts left for Minnesota. Heads that quick strike, and off to his right is Justin Jefferson. Safety over top to help out to protect. Flag. Madison. Looks. Loses the ball. And the Eagles have it for the moment. Pending the call here. Justin Evans winds up at the bottom. Flag is down at the. Just about the line of scrimmage. I don't know if Philadelphia lined up off sides. It looked like they did. I think that might have been a free play. Yep. So free play, no fumble. It was a fumble recovered by the defense. However, offside, defense number 97 lining up in the neutral zone. Five-yard penalty. It's first and five. Terry, we're talking about guys lining up in the neutral zone. It's more of a point of emphasis now than it used to be. It is. They really want him to start the play legally. You know, you look at it, he's clearly in the neutral zone. I kind of think the right tackle is a little far back, so maybe we could have offset those, but it is a foul for offside for sure. A little yin and yang. First down and five. Cousins over the middle, and that's broken up at the two-yard line and taken a shot there was Hawkinson with Justin Evans. Evans, a quick reaction, And if you're a Vikings fan, you're wondering if it was too quick of a reaction trying to hit that seam between the two safeties. Here we go again. That bang-bang play that Terry was talking about before. Same thing. Wow. Terry's giving a thumbs up. He says that's clean. Okay. Second down and five. Does in. A little shoulder shake. Throws. Caught. Jefferson to the five-yard line. He goes. First down and goal. Edmonds covers. They're going to race to the line of scrimmage. Again, saving those two timeouts. Clock under a minute and a half. Great throw. Right over the top of the zone. Over the corner that was Slay. Not playing man that time. Cousins had to put that right on a rope. And he's able to get it over Slay in front of the safety. Hammers in the backfield. Litz coming. Pressure put on. Caught. Into the end zone for the touchdown. T.J. Hawkinson. What a drive. Converted a fourth down along the way. Goes 75 yards, 10 plays in 3 minutes and 3 seconds. You know, this game may end and Philly may win this game, but if I'm a Vikings fan, I know you're disappointed potentially if they end up losing this game. I just love it week two. These first two games haven't gone their way. I just love to see their fighting all the way to the end, trying to do anything they can to get back into this game. And trying to withstand four turnovers tonight. Joseph. Again, we've got a six-point game. You've got two timeouts. He's shown his leadership in this game. Potential onside kicker. Of course, I think how rare it is these days for the kicking team to recover the onside kick. I mean, in a way, you sort of have to do it if you get those two timeouts, but still you're going to have to give up, you know, almost 40 seconds on the play clock at some point. Yeah. I mean, you can call it two quick timeouts, but still they can then run it down to about, you know, 20 seconds or less. Right. And obviously it's set up for the onside kick here. and I got Philadelphia they just wanted to see what the alignment was on the timeout first thing they wanted to do is check that ball he doesn't have a maybe this is common with kickers but usually you see a tee it's kind of propped up unusually for an onside kick here he just has the ball again that's going back to your golf game I know you're a scratch golfer that's like you just hitting it right off the deck You know, is that the way you hit your driver? These days, I'm a healthy scratch. What did I tell you? Honestly, how many days of golf do you play in the L.C.? These days, no. I'm like you. I'm working too hard at this job. I'm not doing 1,800 games, but, you know. Anyway, let's see what happens here with which way he's going to go with this kick. the new rules they got a lineup even number of guys on both sides he got five on his right five on his left Eagles have six guys up at the 45 yard line nine in your picture right there Joseph comes forward hop and a skip and it is covered at the 49 yard line by the Eagles that's Devontae Smith you put the good hands people out there on that particular play and it pays off with it. Yeah, we were talking about the ball not being on the tee. Is it totally usually you see that and you wait for that third bounce and it pops way up into the air. That was more of just trying to use a spin to make the ball take an unusual bounce and it just obviously doesn't work out. So here now the Vikings, they can take their two timeouts but time to get the ball back the Philly has to give it up There's almost no time left on the clock. Not quite a victory formation as yet. Swift takes it. Swift gets to the 46-yard line. His huge night continues. 173 on the ground. You know, nobody's going to win or lose the Super Bowl after two weeks. Philadelphia. If they put it together, think about how dangerous they can be. I think they'll be six. And they can't stop the clock. The Vikings can't, so it's fourth down. They can take that play clock all the way down to around 15 seconds and leave the Vikings with next to nothing. Well, I'll say one thing. You know, I wanted to mention this earlier about Kirk Cousins. You know, he's got that albatross around his neck, can't win in prime time, not a lot of luck in postseason. And if you saw that quarterback series, you really had to come away admiring and really like him.
